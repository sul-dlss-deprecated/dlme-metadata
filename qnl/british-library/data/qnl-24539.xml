This agreement is decidedly of importLce as regards our future negotiations respecting the debouched the Bagdad Railway It is not forma ly or officially acknowledged by the Ottoman GofeXent yel ft has weight with them, and would influence their course of action under certain rircum stances. It is moreover, a difficulty in the way of the Germans which I think has' already accounted m some degree for their desire to come to an understanding with us m regard to the Bagdad Railway. Any exhibition of weakness on the part of ffis/ Majesty s Government or of a desire to shirk the consequences of our agreement with/ Kowe.t, would materially aftect our position, which is a political factor in the situation which, I venture to think, His Majesty s Government ought not lightly to ignore As regards the question as to whether the Sheikh of Koweit should be pressed to keep his promise of flying a distinctive flag on Koweit craft, I am inclined to share the opinion of the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf to the effect that we should use great care m the matter, and choose a propitious opportunity for making the suggestion the more so as, should His Highness act as we urge him to do, I do not see how we can honourably or with credit refuse him protection, and we may unnecessarily have raised a very troublesome question. We bave already marked our connection with Ivoweit by the appointment of a resident, and, I believe, by the establishment of a British post office, as well as sundrv other ways. J I would suggest that the Sheikh should at first fly the new flag in his Konak, or other Government buildings at Koweit, where we should have no difficulty in affording him protection _ if the Turkish Government attempted, which is very unlikely, to interfere with his action. The Imperial Government will thus get accustomed to ’the change, and the way will be prepared for its adoption by degrees on the high seas. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR.

It is clear from Captain Knox’s report, dated the 30th September 1906* that Sheikh Mubarak is not disposed to adopt the distinctive flag unless he is fortified by an assurance that he will not he permitted to suffer from following the advice given him in this connection by the Political Agent. The grant of such an assurance might, however, involve us in responsibilities of a somewhat extended character, since the opportunities which the Turks enjoy of inflicting injury on the Sheikh and his subjects are by no means con fined to Koweit territory, in respect of which we are already pledged to defend * Vide his letter to Sir Edward Grey, No. 358, llim - We note &gt; ^WOVer, that it Was dated the 23rd May 1906. ’ ^cognised* by Sir N.

I have the honour to inform you that, at an interview I had with Sheikh Mubarak at the Agency on the 29th instant, I showed him the books and flags forwarded under cover of your No. 2130, dated 14th September 1906. 2. Sheikh Mubarak at once agreed to the issue of the ships* articles but demurred to the use of the flag which he said was sure to get him into trouble with the Turkish authorities at Basrah. I suggested that it might be possible to fly the flag in the Persian Gulf and Indian waters and to avoid using it in the Shatt-el-Arab, but the Sheikh replied that the Turks would be sure to hear of it and would retaliate by oppressive measures not on the boat that flew the flag but on all Koweit boats indiscrimi nately. 4 . In the absence of instructions, I did not feel justified in expressing surprise at his failing to keep his promise made to you to use the flag. Sheikh Mubarak did not show any marked aversion to the new flag but he cited the cases of Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar ;* and of the Agent of the Firm of Shubaili who, he said, were still languishing in prison at Koniaf, asking what offence they had committed and receiving no reply. He also mentioned a case of which I had not heard previously when an Agent of Sheikh Mubarak was enlisted and taken to El Hassa and eventually bought a substitute to replace himself.

B., dated 4th March 1905, and in continuation of my telegram of 14th instant, I have the honour to report the action taken by me in the direction of advising the Sheikh of Koweit to adopt a distinctive flag for use on vessels belonging to himself or his subjects. 2 . I first broached the subject with Sheikh Mubarak at the end of April, hut he was out in camp at the time and as there was little privacy to he got, it was not possible to discuss patterns in detail. He did not like the idea at first, on the ground that his people would not know what to make of the change, and that such a course would increase the enmity of the Turks towards him For n h vp* uld not a^ree to a fin^ of new design, but 1 explained that this did not seem essential : that all that was required was for his dhows to carry a flag that could he unmistakably recognised as his, and the use of which would make it impossible for Customs Officials at Persian Gulf and other ports to say that they could not distinguish Koweit dhows from any other craft flying the Star and Crescent. I went on to suggest that some addition to, or variation of, the flag that he now hoisted would perhaps meet the case and asked him to let me make out some specimens for him, and also designs for ships, articles which might a'so he useful in conjunction with the flag. To this he agreed, and I had intended to arrange the details in communication with the Political Agent. Unfortunately however Captain Knox fell ill with appendicitis a few days later and subsequently proceeded on leave, and as the matter was of some delicacy it seemed advisable to wait for an opportunity to conclude negotiations with him myself. This I have now done. 3. I had a long interview with Sheikh Mubarak regarding this and other matters on 12th instant. I first showed him the four flags of which speci mens accompany. Of these No. A, in a book of recent date in my possession, is shown as the Standard of the Khedive of Egypt, and I thought it might be of interest to Sheikh Mubarak to see that though the device was still broadly speak ing that of the Star and Crescent, it was easily distinguishable from the flag which he now flies. 1 then showed him the other three and discussed the merits of each with him. He came to the conclusion that No. 1, the Turkish flag with Koweit written across it in the Arabic character, was the simplest pattern for him to adopt, but he did not make any special objections to either of the others, and if Government consider that a greater divergence from the flag would be advisable, I have little doubt that he v\ ould accept any reasonable modification without demur, e.g., the Crescent or the 3 Crescent design, or either of them with Koweit written across it as in the pattern selected. A different type of flag altogether, except it be the British Flag, he will not accept, of that I feel sure. If the flag chosen is approved I think it would be an easier flag to make if the Arabic letters of Koweit were in a little larger type, and if I arrange to have a seal-pattern made up here, perhaps sanction could be accorded to my indenting on the Ordnance Department for others, as in the case of the Trucial Chiefs. 4 . I also discussed with him the form of a certificate which it would seem useful for his dhows to carry in conjunction with the flag ; and a specimen of the form provisionally approved by him, subject to the concurrence of Govern ment, is attached. If it is considered unobjectionable I would solicit authority t 0 get some printed at the Government Press in cheque book form with counter- ’foils. 1mBSBSSSSaeBB^VH'' No. 346, dated Busliire. 22nd (received 31st) July 1903. From- -Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To-S. M. Frasee, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 337 , dated 16th July 1905, I have the , for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a ktewitu enclosure since received by me from Sheikh Mubarak in confirmation of what passed at our interview the day before. 2 It will be noticed that he speaks of our advice to him in the matters referred to as “ directions/’ I think it well therefore to point out that this has no significance ; it is a common form of speech in which the writer thinks it potite &amp; to speak of himself as being in the humble position of receiving - raoori Varfliv sav that I merely asked his views, and gave him our rvi*rlAi'a T 3 As regards the ( ) or Articles, these were discussed between us as being, in some form, a necessary adjunct to the flag, for the reasons which he explains, and the design, of which I forwarded a copy with my letter last week, was that provisionally decided upon by us in consultation. It is difficult to make out from Sheikh Mubarak’s present letter whether he means to suggest that on further consideration the pattern first chosen is perhaps too elaborate for the taste ot his subjects, who might not take the trouble to get them filled in, or whether he proposes to have it in addition to the original one selected. I will take steps to find out exactly what he does mean. Mean while I forward a copy, with translation, of the document which he has sent me. 4 . The point to he borne in mind is that more often than not Persian Customs officials at Gulf Ports do not know Arabic and are not familiar with Sheikh Mubarak’s seal or signature ; it is therefore not surprising if they refuse to take cognizance of some irregular slip of paper produced by a Nakhoda and asserted to be a credential from the Sheikh of Koweit. 5. It was for this reason-that I thought that it would he an additional advantage to have an English translation of the Articles alongside the Arabic, so that after getting his paper filled in and signed in Arabic by the Sheikh, the Nakhoda could, if he wished, get the English equivalents written up at the British Agency above the Sheikh’s signature. A certificate in such a form as that submitted with my last report would moreover seem to serve the useful purposes both of furnishing indirect evidence of the close relations between the Sheikh and ourselves, and also of the fact that the flag depicted at the head of the Articles is not the Turkish Flag but a dis tinct! ve flag adopted by Sheikh Mubarak as an independent Ruler for the use of his own subjects.

I consider that pattern flag, marked I, enclosed in your letter, ' defaced ” as proposed by Arabic characters indicating the word “ Koweit,’’ is the most suitable flag for the Sheikh to adopt, but I suggest that in addition to the Arabic characters, the word “ Koweit ” should be placed on the flag in Roman capitals, to prevent any official who might be ignorant of Arabic from pleading that he did not understand; thus Koweit ie fom!* i^worded fon ?&gt; Paragraph {Signature of Sheikh.) 4No. 4040-E.

In reply, I am to enclose a copy of a letter No. 1462, dated the 23rd August 1905, from the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, and to say that, if you see no objection, you may recommend the adoption, by Sheikh Mubarak, of the form of certificate and of the pattern of flag as amplified by His Excellency Vice-Admiral G. Atkinson-Willes. 3. In the event of the Sheikh of Koweit agreeing to your recommendations, you should endeavour to get the pattern flag made locally, but if this is not found feasible, or if further information is required, the matter should be settled by you in direct communication with the Ordnance Officer in charge of the Bombay Arsenal to whom the necessary instructions will be issued.

Meanwhile, I have the honour to inquire whether, in the possible event of Sheikh Mubarak objecting to the English superscription, the Government of India would be willing to fall back on the alternative flag bearing the Arab letters only ? It would no doubt be convenient to have the English letters as well, but I do not attach very great importance to it, and even if the Sheikh prefers not to have the English superscription now, there would probably be little difficulty in getting him to acquiesce in the addition of it later on.

I am, however, to point out that the superscriptiou which has been proposed is traced not in letters peculiarly English, bu in e Itoman character which may be regarded as common to all European nations, and that the adoption of the transliteration is made the more advisable by the activity of the Belgian officials of the Persian Maritime Customs service, who might plead ignorance of the meaning of a purely Arabic device. ^ G.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 4576-E.B., dated 11th December 1905, on the subject of a distinctive flag accompanied by printed Certificates of Nationality, to be used by vessels belonging to Sheikh Mubarak or bis subjects. 2. I have just returned from a visit to Koweit. I had taken over with Naval Commander-in-Chief to Foreigrn Depart- Die a specimen flag and printed certificates ment, No. 1452, dated 23rd August 1905 , para- made up with additions recommended by grapil 2 * Vice-Admiral Sir George Atkinson-Willes, and discussed •them with the Sheikh at an interview which he had with the Political Agent and myself on the 7th instant. He readily confirmed acceptance of the certificate, now in printed form, with the exception of item “5. —Name of Master”. He explained that this entry would be useless and perhaps misleading as Nakhodas so constantly change. There is truth in this, and as the other details of the certificate will amply identify any vessel, I recommend that it be eliminated as he suggests. 3. As to the flag, I regret to say that Sheikh Mubarak would not accept it as it stood, i.e., with the word “ Koweit ” in the Roman as well as the Arabic character. When the flag was first displayed to him, he forthwith asked permission to explain what seemed to him the objections to his adopting it, and added that if, after hearing them, I were to decide that they were not weighty, he would be prepared to introduce the flag. What he went on to say however amounted to a good deal more than this. He proceeded to recapitulate all his old grievances against the Turks, much as he had at my interview with Resident to the Government of India, No. 387, on ^he Subject OU 12th July last, dated 13 th August 1905 , paragraph 3 . _ , • . . *’ •-i i u j t In conclusion he said he would adopt the flag as it stood if we would give him a written guarantee to protect him from any unpleasant consequences from the Turks which might result to him from the use of it. On my probing his misgivings it became evident that it was the inscrip tion in the Roman character in which he saw so much difficulty. The nature of this addition and the reasons for it were fully explained to him, and he was informed that it was the Admiral, as a sailor, who had specially recommended it in order that it might enable the identity of the Koweit flag to be readily understood by Belgian Customs officials or other Europeans who could not read the oriental character. My explanations, however, did not dispel his objections, and therefore, subject to the final views of Government, the only thing to do seemed to be to make the best of the flag without the English inscription, which Sheikh Mubarak adhered to his previously expressed readiness to adopt. 4. As the word “ Koweit ** has now been eliminated, I have had the letters made a little larger and submit a specimen flag for i avo ^ r inspection, together with the printed certificate as finally accepted by Sheikh Mubarak. In the first instance it will, I think, be advisable to supply the Sheikh gratis with— one dozen Bunting Flags 4J' X 2J', and five hundred certificates in two books of 250 each ; 914 F.

The Mushir proposes eventually to allow British intervention on behalf of these people, who, according to treaty with Turkey, will be regarded and treated as subjects of Turkey.

COPY OF TELEGRAM Dated Received at London Office 2 S' /W ,^Confidential.] M - iS^/ob ^ 777^ J No. 620, dated Bushire, the 18th (received 27th) March 1906. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, -The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Having spent three days at Koweifc during last week, I have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, a few observations regarding the present aspect of affairs there. I met Sheikh Mubarak on three occasions, and on 7th instant had a lengthy interview with him at the Agency, for the details of which I beg reference to the attached memorandum drawn up for me by Captain Knox who was likewise present. It will be seen that during it several topics were touched upon, some of which are subjects of separate correspondence. 2. The trend of our conversation regarding the affairs of Central Arabia, which was started by Sheikh Mubarak, is of some significance. JThe possibi lity of the Ruler of Koweit smoking the calumet of peace with^Ein Rashid, and Mubarak’s own vision of a three-cornered compact between himself, Bin Rashid and Bin Saood, which would in practice probably be found to amount to a defensive alliance for resistance to Turkish expansion in Nejd and Hassa, is an interesting, if somewhat utopian, prospect to contemplate. It is to be feared however that Sheikh Mubarak’s own ambitions, as indi cated in the second of the conditions suggested by him to Bin Rashid, are likely to form the chief obstacle to such a development. On the other hand, there is no doubt that in the course of the strife of the last few years both Bin Saood and Bin Rashid must have been brought to realise what a strong position the Ruler of Koweit, territorially situated as he is, occupies both strategically and politically in relation to them, and they evidently see the advantage of maintaining friendly relations with him. In connection with Bin Saood’s doings I may remark it is possible that his recent telegram to the Porte was sent to disarm suspicion preparatory to some further move, as recent reports from Bahrein show that the Turks are now having trouble at Hofuf, in which it seems possible, if not probable, that Bin Saood has had an indirect hand. 3. As for Sheikh Mubarak’s attitude towards ourselves, I do not consider that on the whole it gives any present cause for dissatisfaction or anxiety; rather the contrary. As long as the practical expression of his sentiments in regard to us undergoes no change, the improvement of the relations between Mubarak and the Turkish authorities at Basrah, within reasonable limits, is , rather a convenience to us than otherwise. The Sheikh’s treatment of our Agent and his invariable demeanour towards myself could not be more satis factory and sensible than it is. He has always treated Captain Knox exceed ingly well; more so than ever lately, and it is a matter of satisfaction to me as it will, I am sure, be to Government that our representative seems clearly to have gained Sheikh Mubarak’s personal regard, and that he is visited freely in a friendly way by many of the Sheikh’s subjects. He is thus making useful influence of a kind which seems to be all we require at present and which we can legitimately cultivate. It is only in regard to the arms question that the position at the present moment leaves much to be desired, and this is partly owing to the fact that the general question of the Gulf arms traffic is sub judice. I do not know quite what line to take with the Sheikh in the event of our having an exhaustive exchange of views in this connection, and until I am sure of our intentions it seems better for me to keep off the subject and avoid any specific discussion with him. 4. The question of the conveyance of the Turkish postal bag to Al Hassa, of which a good deal has been said, has I think been somewhat misunderstood, and I concur with the Political Agent in thinking that there 5628 F. D, •tT/4'V ? is nothinff in the existing wOfki^g arrangement which need cause us to take exception to, or be exercised by, Sheikh Mubarak s connection with it. Note of a conversation between the Resident in the Persian Gulf and Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, dated 7th March 191)6. On 7th March 1906, at 4 p.m., the Sheikh of Koweit returned the informal visit paid by the Resident on the previous day. The present interview lasted about an hour and a half, and Sheikh Mnbarak was friendly and cordial as usual. The Sheikh informed the Resident that he thought he would be interested to hear that he had lately, on 24th (D The prospects of peace in the interior. February (29th Zi-ul-Haj), received a letter from Bin Rashid couched in friendly language and proposing that Sheikh Mubarak should be on the same terms of friendship with him as the Rulers of Koweit had been with his uncle and grandfather before him. The Sheikh said that he had replied to Bin Rashid that be, Mubarak, was a man who loved peace and quietness and would welcome friendly relations with him, provided that Bin Rashid would keep within his own boundaries and not harass his neighbours, and was really sincere in his desire for peace. The Resident, in the way of friendly interest, asked how peace could be arranged between the two ; whether a personal meeting would be necessary or whether trusted messengers would be sent. The Sheikh replied that it would be done by correspondence and that a meeting would be unnecessary. He proceeded to sketch the terms on which, in his opinion, a reconciliation between him and Bin Rashid could be con sidered practicable. These were:— (i) That Bin Rashid should have Chhaffa (Kaffa) and Hail, and the Bedouins of Jebel Shammar. (ii) That he, Bin Sabah, should have Koweit, Aneyza, Boreyda, Sedeyr, and Washm and should control the tribes occupying them. (iii) That Bin Saood should have Nejd and the Wadi Dowasir. The Resident asked if Sheikh Mubarak thought that he would be able to keep the parties to their agreement with himself and with one another ; and the Sheikh replied that he could. The Resident then asked whether under such circumstances Bin Rashid would have sufficient income to enable him to live without harrying his neighbours, and Sheikh Mubarak replied that he would have Hail and Chhaffa, the Zakat of Shammar and the produce of forays on the Harb and Aneyza tribes between Hail and Medina. Asked what view the Turks would, in his opinion, take of this triple alliance, Sheikh Mubarak replied that they would undoubtedly regard it with disfavour. The Resident then asked whether the relations between Sheikh Mubarak (2) The relations between Bin Subah and Bin &amp;ud Bin Saood Continued the Same as a0 °v j x formerly; to which Sheikh Mubarak replied that they did, and that Bin Saood still listened to his advice. Major Cox then thanked the Sheikh for his co-operation in ascertaining the truth regarding Bin Saood’s alleged intention to visit Oman. Mubarak rejoined that Seyyid Feisal of Maskat had also written to him anc that he had told His Highness that there was no cause for apprehension, an at Bin oaood had quite enough to do where he was for some time to come. A refeience was then made to the long telegram sent from Bushire to Constantinople through Jasim bin Thani on behalf of Bin Saood. Sheikh Mubarak was asked what inference he drew from the fact that Bin Saood had not consulted him before, and regarding its despatch. The Sheikh said that lie had received full details from Bin Saood’s messenger, Mussad bin Suweilim, w.coall k icewj- Dotkiul A d W wlio sent the telegram, but admitted that he bad beard nothing on the subject direct from tbe Bin Saood family or from Abd-ur-Rahman. He thought this was because the telegram had been inspired by Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, of whom he spoke in no very favourable terms. Sheikh Mubarak next mentioned that Nasir bin Mubarak of the El ( 3 ) Visit to Koweit of Nasir bin Mubarak the Khali tab family had just been paying outlaw relative of the Sheikh of Bahrein, on e of his periodical visits and had only left a couple of days before. He continued that Nasir had told him of his meeting with Captain Prideaux, and had gone on to ask him (Sheikh Mubarak) to put in a good word for him to the Resident with a view to a reconciliation being effected between himself and Sheikh Esa. Sheikh Mubarak agreed with the Resident in thinking that Sheikh Esa would resent any overtures on behalf of Nasir Mubarak, and that it would be difficult to alter the latter’s circumstances during Sheik Esa’s lifetime. The Resident then introduced the topic (4) A distinctive flag for Koweit 0 f the flag and ships* articles to be carried by Koweit vessels. It may be mentioned here that the Resident had brought with him a specimen flag of the pattern previously selected by Sheikh Mubarak with the addition of the word “ Koweit ” in Roman letters as w r ell as Arabic. Tbe “ articles ” were read over to the Sheikh and it was explained that it was proposed that the English translation should be verified by the signature of the Political Agent, and this the Sheikh considered would be an advantage. Sheikh Mubarak approved of the “ articles ” with the exception of the item “ Name of Nakhoda.” To this he objected, as the Nakhodas were always changing. The Sheikh then inspected the flag, and after doing so said that he would lay before the Resident what appeared to him the objections to the use of the flag as now shown him, and that then, if the Resident did not consider the objections of any weight, he would be prepared to order his subjects to adopt the new pattern. The Sheikh then explained Ms objections at some length. He recited his grievances against the Turks and their oppression in the matter of his Eao date gardens and their ingratitude for all he had done in their behalf. He clearly showed that he considered that all the trouble he experienced at their hands* was due to his friendly attitude towards the British Governme nt. He said in conclusion that he would accept the flag as it stood if we would give him a written guarantee to protect him against an^ consequences that might arise to him from its use. It proved, on further enquiry characters to which he objected. The reason for this addition was thoroughly explained to him, but the explanation did not remove his objections and he was therefore told that the European lettering was only a useful addition and not an essential, and he then expressed himself as quite ready to adopt the fig, without the English letters, and combined with the “ Articles,” for use by his subjects. Sheikh Mubarak next informed the Resident that Bin Rashid had sent a * . r\ messenger to Meshhed Ali, who had laid (5) The late Yusuf bm r a m o oura. hands on all the money belonging to ^Yusuf bin Brahim in that place. Sheikh Mubarak then went dP to explain that he too had claims against the house of Bin Brahim ; that account books, in Arab merchants’ dealings, were the only evidence, and that Ue deposits belonging to himself in the hands was the addition of the English it that * loot th-1 &amp; !^t ^ Ik &amp;■famminH imumr of Abdul Aziz bin Brahim, the present ^ representative, amounted to Bs. 1,30,000, and that the advances against him were Rs. 70,000 showing a balance of Bs. 60,000 in his favour. He said that Abdul Aziz at present resided at Surat in the Bombay Presidency and would certainly contest the claim, and that he (Sheikh Mubarak) would be glad of assistance from the Resident to enable him to obtain a settlement of the accounts and the payment of the balance due to him. He said he would be glad to appoint an Agent who would take the account books to Bombay for examination. In this connection Sheikh Mubarak seemed to be only putting forward a feeler and did not make any definite proposals. In conclusion the Resident asked Sheikh Mubarak whether he could (6) The general position of sheikh Mubarak’s inform Government that his affairs gene* affairs. rally were, as they seemed to be, in a satisfactory and prosperous condition. Mubarak replied that they were. Asked, “as regards the Turkish authorities?’* he rejoined, “yes;'just at present they are satisfactory but it costs me £1,500 Turkish a year in douceurs to their officials to maintain that position.** The Sheikh then expressed his gratitude for the amount of British pro tection received; declared that the peace and rest he now enjoyed were, he knew, the result of British support; and that he desired no other or better protectors. He concluded by referring to the pleasant relations which existed between himself and the British representative. ;#rSecretar Mary °f St irSecretai totary of Si[Confidential ] -n\ U No. 310 , dated Bushire, the 2 nd (received 10 th) July 1905 .

Sib, We have the honour to address you regarding our relations with Koweit with special reference to the question of the U Government are prepared to grant to subjects of the Sheikh in Persian temtoiy. which has been brought into prominence by the Gulf ^ The details of these occurrences are narrated m te enc osu desoatch and their principal features may he briefly stated •- P In Anril 1904 Mons.

In agreeing to this course, however, the Persian Gov ernment expressly intimated that their consent was based on the British nation ality of the Arab’s employment, and abstained from committing themselves to an acceptance of either the British or Turkish view as to the international status of Koweit. Mention of this incident has been added, as the issue involved is the same, though the case is of a somewhat different character to those preceding, and we do not propose any further action in regard to it. 3. The present is not the first occasion on which the question of the status of Koweit subjects has come under review. The point was raised in 1900 in connection with the importation of certain arms into Persia by a merchant said to be a subject of the Sheikh. Our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was then informed by Lord Lansdowne that Koweit was not under formal British protection, though we had promised the Sheikh our good offices; that natives of Koweit could not be claimed as British protected persons, nor would they be justiciable by British Consular Tribunals in Persia. It was added that interference to protect any Koweit subject was undesirable, and that action on the part of the Resident was unnecessary until he was appealed to, but that endeavours should be made to ascertain the facts as to the man’s nationality and the Sheikh’s wishes as to resisting Turkish claims to jurisdiction over him. 4. In the recent cases we are left in no doubt as to the nationality of the affected parties or as to the wishes of Sheikh Mubarak, who has requested our assistance in formal and strongly worded communications addressed to our Political Agent at Koweit. We have not overlooked the fact that His Majesty’s Government have intimated that they are not prepared to declare a foBmal protectorate over the Sheikh’s territories, and have even admitted that Koweit is within the Turkish Empire. The latter pronouncement, however, was accompanied by the important qualification that the authority of the Sublime Porte is of an entirely unsubstantial character, and that in fact the Chief enjoys a large measure of practical independence. By his engagement of the 23rd January 1899, the Sheikh virtually placed the conduct of his external relations in our hands,^ and he now naturally looks to the British Government to assist his subjects when in trouble with officials of the Persian Government. In 1902 he was formally assured of British protection against an attack on Koweit, and he has repeatedly been informed that His Majesty’s Gov ernment will lend him their good offices, so long as he adheres to their advice. Ihe visit of His Excellency Lord Curzon, in December 1903, was regarded as a further declaration of our intention to protect and befriend him; while the recent appointment of a British Agent to reside at Koweit or, as we now un- derst and from your recent telegrams, to pay periodical visits to Koweit, has led the Sheikh and his subjects to expect a larger measure of support than thev have hitherto received. We feel strongly that it is incumbent upon us to assist him to the utmost of our powers, and that failure to do so must lead not only to a complete loss of the influence which we have acquired over the Sheikh Who plainly warns us that he will he obliged to seek other relief if we are unable P ut a st0 P t0 Persian tyranny over his sea-faring subjects, but also to a coasTo/the Gulf f °Th PreStlg ? both th e Arabian and Persian coasts ot the Gulf. The prospect of the latter result is one which, in view of equan V imity deS1SaS ° f P ° WerS in theSe resionS &gt; we oould not re S ard witb c i,r' r '' ^ !! e repudiation of Turkish pretensions to treat as subiects of the Sublime Porte natives of Koweit territory is no new thing. ?n 1902 in connec- kTlWed a 6 laim P rt!,” ? is ^esty’s Consul at Basrah Sy tunaMf 1 pr0feiTOd by tbo . Wali of Basrah. But for. issue with the Turkish 1 -r P resent cases &gt; it is unnecessary to raise this into direct conflict with t) °r to take any action which need bring us Maiesty’s Government^ the ■ P . orteat a _ moment when, we understand, His 1 y vemment are anxious to avoid complications in that quarter. Allthat is required is that we should arrive at an understanding with the Persian Government as to the status of subjects of the Sheikh within the dominions of cu a point as to which we hold that our relations with the ^ • i 118 direct demand for our protection no longer permit the attitude of the British Government to^ remain undefined. So far, it will he observed from the correspondence of which we have the honour to enclose copies, the local officials of the Persian Customs Department have declined to admit the right of our representatives to intervene on behalf of Koweit subjects. We suggest that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran should now be authorised to explain to the Persian Government that we claim recognition of Koweitans as British protected persons. Should the Shah’s Ministers question our pretension, they might be informed ^ of the terms of our agreement concluded with the Sheikh in 1899, and it might be pointed out that our right to intervene, by virtue of similar treaties, on behalf of subjects of the Trucial Chiefs, has already been recognised and acted upon. At the least, it might he required that Koweitans should he entitled to the same privileges as Afghan subjects in Persia, on whose behalf it has been arranged that “ the friendly recommend ations and wishes of the British Government should be accepted”. 6 . As regards the specific incidents which have made it necessary to raise the general question, we consider that in cases (a) and (6), in the absence of satisfactory explanation by the Customs Department, there is good ground for a claim to compensation. In respect of (&lt;?), we think that the Sheikh is clearly entitled to an apology; while as regards (d), without entering into the question of the doubtful claim of the Persian Government to exercise a right of search on the waters of the Shat-el-Arab—against this we understand that the Porte have already entered a protest at Tehran—we hold that, in the particular instance, their action was entirely unjustified, inasmuch as the vessel in question was bound not for a Persian, but for a Turkish port, while the confiscated arms may reasonably be taken to have been required for purposes of self-protection. The insecurity of the Shat-el-Arab is notorious; wo have recently had occasion to urge that representations should be made to the Persian Government regard ing a grave outrage on a British vessel in the estuary; and we understand that the Persian Government have themselves lately admitted the propriety of native craft carrying arms in these waters. In this case also, therefore, we would press for pecuniary amends. The Persian Government may rest assured of our anxiety to check the traffic in arms, but, even assuming that their proceedings were directed solely to the repression of illicit trade, and were in no way inspired by a desire to harass a protege of the British Government, we are unable to countenance high-handed action, such as that of the Persian Customs officials in the present instance. We have purposely abstained from mention of the further case in which a vessel sailing from Koweit was admittedly found to have concealed on board 28 rifles, in respect of which suspicions may reasonably exist that they were contraband, whether intended for a Turkish or Persian destination. 7. It will be observed that, in connection with this subject, Major Cox has raised the question of the flag flown by Koweit vessels. The matter was considered in 1901, and it was then decided that, in view of the objections which the Sublime Porte might raise to any change as involving a disturbance of the status quo, it was preferable to abstain from advising the adoption of another flag. We agree with the Besident, however, that there would be a distinct advantage if Koweit ships hoisted a distinctive ensign, and, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, we would propose to approach the Sheikh on the subject. Should the Sheikh agree to the proposal, and should the Porte hereafter raise objections, we would point out that we have an agreement with the Chief whereby we are entitled to search Koweit craft for contraband arms, and that being desirous of avoiding any risk of detaining a Turkish ship by mistake for a Koweit vessel—a very possible contingency if both fly the same flag—we had recommended the Sheikh to adopt distinctive colours for shipping purposes, while retaining his present flag for use in Koweit.TORT WILLIAM ■FOREIGN EEEA.RTMENT.

A Persian subject has brought a charge of causing him hurt against a Koweit Arab who is in the permanent paid employ of the British India Steam Navigation Company as pilot for steamers carrying His Majesty’s mail*. Both on grounds of his employment and his alien nationality, I wish to give the Arab the good offices of this Consulate to the extent of sending a represen tative to be present at the trial in order to see that no injustice is done, as there is reason to expect. ^ My suggestion is acquiesced in by thePoreign Office Agent, but he said that owing to the Governor’s misrepresentation case is complicated by Turkish Consular Agent who claims to protect the Arab as a Turkish subject. Both the Governor and I have declined to recognise this claim. The case could probably be settled with despatch if Your Excellency would move the Mushir-ed-Dowleh to instruct the Poreign Office Agent to dispose of it, and admit the Resident’s representative at the trial. He says that he is quite ready to do so. Meanwhile the Arab will, with concurrence of local authoriti es, remain in my custody. (Addressed to Sir A. Hardinge.) Telegram, No. 2214-E.

Dane, Esq., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Simla. Certain cases have recently occurred in which the Nacodas of Koweit dhows appear to have been needlessly oppressed by Belgian Customs officials, and the Besidency Agent at Lingah asks to be informed definitely as to what amount of protection he is entitled to afford them. 2. In one case the late Director-General of Bushire Customs, Monsieur Damhrain, while cruising in the “ Muzafferi ” last April, overhauled a Koweit dhow at sea, betweeu Hindarahi and Kais Island in the hopes of finding arms in her. Being unable to search her at sea he towed her in to Lingah where he had her cargo taken out and detained her several days. Finding her cargo innocent (it consisted of wooden rafters from Kishm) he allowed it to he put hack, but (as if to show that his action was justified) he found the Nacoda guilty of neglecting some technical detail of Customs Begulations and fined him 25 tomans. The Nacoda went straight back to Koweit and complained to Sheikh Mubarek that in the first place he had been seized on the high seas out of sight of land, and that secondly, though his cargo was innocent and he had not inten tionally committed any breach of rules, he had been delayed for several days and eventually fined 25 tomans. The Director-General was approached informally by my predecessor, and the process was repeated by me but without any satisfactory result. 3. A second complaint has now been received from the Kesidency Agent at Lingah, giving details of another case in which he alleges that a Koweit dhow, with a certificate from Sheikh Mubarek to say that the dhow and cargo were Koweit owmed, has been mulcted of 20 bags of wheat and has been detained several days. This case is still under correspondence. 4. It is not however with regard to individual cases or the details of them that I have thought it necessary to trouble Government. My object is to invite the consideration of the Government of India to the general question of the extent to which protection or good offices can now be afforded to subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit when in difficulties of the kind above explained. It is evident to me that if we wish to maintain our influence with Sheikh Mubarek, much less to stengthen it, we must accept some responsibility to see ordinary justice meted out to his subjects in places where we have Agents, as far as lies in our power. I am also inclined to deduce from one or tw r o local incidents that there is some tendency on the part of local officials, possibly prompted from outside, to make a special set against Koweit subjects at the present time. With an Agent at Koweit and in view of Sheikh Mubarek’s energetic entreaties, we shall henceforward be in a stronger position to use our influence in the direction desired; and while on this subject, I venture to inquire whether we might not now press the Sheikh to adopt a distinctive device for his flag, which would enable the vessels of his subjects to be identified. At present the fact that Koweit dhows fly the Turkish flag unaltered in any way makes it easy for Customs officials to ignore their Koweit origin, and encourages Turkish Consular representatives who wish to obtrude their ex pensive protection. Translated extract from a letter dated 31st March 1904, from Sheihh Mubarek to the Resident. After giving details of the seizure and detention of a Koweit dhow * ® « And we will not endure this treatment and your sense of honour will not permit that those who are under your protection shall be treated in such a way. 1** Therefore have I made this appeal to you. “ And in this connection, when we see that we get protection from you we shall feel honoured and so will our subjects. And such treatment is hoped for and is an attribute of your glorious Government. “ If, on the other hand, you take no notice of this and such tyranny over our subjects who ply their seafaring pursuits is not put a stop to by you, then we shall be obliged to look out for some other condition of affairs which will give us relief from it. The result of it is that all our subjects who travel are in a state of alarm, and all we ask of you is to see that the trade of our seafar ing subjects is not brought to a standstill by such treatment, etc. * * « Finally we beg your kind solicitude for the protection of all our subjects in any direction which will honour them and preserve them from tyranny. ‘‘May you be preserved, and salaams.”'^puz/Z.

The Arabistan Customs were separated from the Gulf Customs. Dees not the visit of the Bushire Director in “Persepolis” constitute a direct violation of the arrangement between the Persian Government and the Sheikh. We have no information if the Sheikh omitted to lend his boats to the local Customs officers as provided in the arrangement, but, if he did not, the presence in his jurisdiction of outside Customs vessels appears to require expla nation, more especially as his approval is required to the appointment of such officers.

I have heard on good authority that on the 24th September 1904, the Director of Customs at Mohammerah submitted the following report to the Ministry of Customs:— Begins. Having received a report to the effect that a large number of rifles had been shipped from Maskat for Gosbah, which is at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, where there is no Custom-house, I sent Muzaffari there for a few days simply to seize the arms. 42 rifles and nearly 6,000 cartridges have been found and confiscated. Muzaffari left some days ago for Bushire. Ends* He does not mention having applied to the Sheikh for boats, I am having enquiries made at Mohammerah. Two Koweit dhows have been seized ap parently between Gosbah and Pao, one of them which had 14 rifles on board was released on payment of a fine of 800 tomans under protest : the other which had 28 rifles on board has been detained at Bushire pending the payment of a fine of 1,200 tomans.

From— W. McDouall, Esq., His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah, To— Sir Arthur Hardinge, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran. I have the honour to report that, on the evening of the 11th instant, the Sardar Arfa sent to inform me that his official at Gusbah at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab‘reported that the Imperial Customs steamer “ Muzafferi ” was there, and was stopping and searching boats of all kinds, and he was afraid there might be trouble, as he could not be everywhere at once. His Excellency, as the Customs had thus assumed the policing of the river, was very glad to be relieved of that expense, and would remove his patrols in a few days’ time if the vessel remained, and inform us officially that he was no longer responsible for the safety of the river which had been assumed by the Customs. Therefore I sent a telegram to Basrah to be sent to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, giving the above facts, and Haji Rais Tujar promised that the patrols should not be removed for a few days to give time for a reply to be received. I have seen the Sardar Arfa twice on this subject. He points out that, although he is supposed to be head of the Customs, the “ Muzafferi ” has been sent into his jurisdiction without his being informed : secondly, as Governor, he should have been warned in order to take steps to prevent trouble by sending men of his own to be present at the searching of suspected boats. He understands they stop both sea and river boats and their boats enter the creeks, so that a collision might occur with the tribesmen in the absence of his men. Thirdly, he is warden of the marches (Sarhaddar), and the Shatt-el-Arab being the border between Turkey and Persia, complications with Turkey may arise over the actions of the “ Muzafferi”; and if the Turkish authorities at Basrah ask for an explanation, he has none to give. He also reiterated what he had said regarding withdrawing the patrols, and wished His Majesty’s Minister to be informed that he might take any action, if advisable. In the event of his withdrawing the patrols, there is, in my opinion, a likeli hood of a recrudescence of piracy in the river. I also believe that interference with the tribesmen, in the absence of the Sardar Arfa’s men, is likely to lead to trouble. No. 8, dated Mohamraerah, the 16th September 1904 (Confidential). From— W. McDouall, Esq., His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah, To— Sir Arthur Hardinge, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran. I have the honour to report that the Sardar Arfa is making certain com plaints to the Minister of the Interior at Tehran, of which he wishes you to be informed, but not with a view to asking for support in the matter.In the firman given him in connection with the Customs, it is distinctly stated that the Directorship-in-Chief (Riasat-i-kul; of the Customs of Arabistan is his : that, as there are no capable local men, Mons. Waffelaerat and Mons. Mirzayanty are to be sent to be in charge of the Customs under his Director ship and orders, and his Directorship is under the Ministry of Customs. He undertakes to carry out the orders of the Ministry of Customs, and to lend his private steamers, when required, for preventive service. This Directorship appears to be practically ignored, but whether this is the fault of the local Customs or the Ministry he does not know. Clerks have been appointed with out reference to him, and other small matters show that the local Directorate ignore his headship. Again, the Customs of Arabistan is not under Bushire as is shown by the firman above, yet the Bushire administration have sent the “ Muzaft’eri” into the Shatt-el-Arab to search for arms and other contraband, and, on the Captain reporting that he had arrested two sailing boats with arms, the Bushire Director ordered him to bring them to Bushire. The Captain could not do this, so brought them to Mohammerah, and telegraphed to Bushire for the “ Persepolis” to come for them. Some months ago the Cashier of the Mohammerah Customs embezzled moneys belonging to the Customs and absconded to Karachi, where he was arrest ed. The Sardar Arfa, at the request of the Customs, issued a warrant to two of his guards to receive the prisoner and bring him to Mohammerah, and his signature and position were authenticated at this Consulate. On this warrant the prisoner was extradited and brought to Mohammerah, and detained at the Customs House. After a preliminary examination, at which • the Sardar Arfa was represented, Mons. Waffelaert being transferred to Bushire, took the prisoner with him, and handed him over to the custody of the authorities at Bushire, aUbough the offence was committed in the jurisdiction of Arabistan. Prom this it appears that the Customs wish to ignore his position as Governor, as well as that of supreme Director of the Customs of Arabistan, and he considers it necessary to report this to the Central Government.y a$ arrest. :ained at e Sardar tootle )rities at jabistai Extracts from the Diary of the Political Presidency in the Persian Gulf for the week ending 24th September 1904, * * • * Mohammerah. * * • « * 13.

Xe Mtiatkin Of this policy was marked by the abortive attempt to occupy Ahn Musa and Tamh and, since that failed, the pohey has been continued by Abu Musa and la &gt; 0 pp re s S ion on Arab dhows, especially those Snffrom St ' n^it has now'culminated, if I have been correctly Wormed! S a wanton and unjustifiable insult to an independent Chief under British protection. - ... .. . 4 One of the most oppressive and vexatious forms of this policy is the invariable assumption by the Customs Department that the Arab Nakhoda is S wr^r^d must prove his innocence. I will instance the case of an unfortunate, named Mubarak-bin-Khalifa. 5 . This man was detained at Lingah for twenty-one days, having been brought from Sheivah, where he had already been detained eight days for the nurnose Twenty bags of grain were taken from him as security, and he was told to wait and prove his innocence. There is fairly strong evidence that Ins wheat cargo for which he was unable to account satislactoiily was legitimate, and, having come under a pass from the Persian port of Mashur was, six months latter, re-exported from Koweit, but this naturally took time to prove. The case has my attention. 6 . Binding his other cargo rotting during his detention, ^Mubarak made his escape, and put out to sea. The Belgians have detained him, and some of his crew pending trial for a month, and have confiscated twenty bags of his grain for an offence which, there is reason to believe, he never committed, and has vet to he proved, a gainst him, but for this last heinous offence in disobeying their order to wait and prove his innocence, he is to be persecuted m every Persian port in which he dares to show his face. They have caught him once already, and attached a small boat of his, but could not manage to detain the man himself, who is now in Koweit. 7. It is perhaps unnecessary to call to your remembrance the case, on yonr office records, of the Koweit boat which, it is alleged, was searched unsuccessfully for arms in the open sea, and then towed into territorial waters and heavily fined for a technical breach of the Customs Begulaiions. 8 . This extraordinary assumption that Arab Nakhodas are hound to prove that they have not committed an offence against the Customs Department can have only one result, where on the one side we have a well-regulated department, armed with clerks, regulations, and engines of oppression of every description, and on the other ignorant Nakhodas seldom able even to read and write. 9 . The feeling in Koweit itself is very bitter against the Belgians, and might at any time, lead to acts of retaliation on Persians, and thus the situa tion would become acute and dangerous. 10. If the Customs Administration persist in this course of conduct, the only remedy that appears to me at all likely to meet the situation is that one of our gun-boats should attend the Muzafferi and Persepolis, wherever they go, especially in the open sea, and whenever they overhaul a boat hailing from the western shores of the Gulf, the Commander of the gun-boat should insist on having a clear primd facie case against the boat being made out to his satis faction or the immediate release of the vessel. 11 . The alleged interference with boats bound for Basrah will no doubt form the subject of a protest from the Turkish local authorities, and I would venture to suggest that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah be addressed on the subject. 12. In conclusion, I would crave indulgence for this hastily written prelim minary report. The whole subject is under the close and anxious attention of Sheikh Mubarak and myself, and I hope, at leisure, to submit more fully matured proposals for the solution of the very important difficulties involved therein.[Translation). Dated the 13th September 1904 (2nd Rajab 132-1). From— Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, Chief of Koweit, To —Captain S. G. Knox ; Political Agent, Koweit. After compliments .—We petition you that the Persian ship, in which are posted Belgians, is now cruising from the buoy to Gushah within the Shat-el-Arab, and seized vessels, and searches them, and delays them on their journeys; that it has seized our boom and helium which voyage between here and Eao, bringing wood and dates for us, and delayed them some days, and they (the boom and helium) told them that they were our private boats, and that their work was between Koweit and Pao, bringing wood and dates, and after this vexation they let them go. And now they have seized a boat of our subjects going to Basrah from Koweit, and have taken their arms which all the boats carry for protection from pirates, and this matter is well known to all the Governments. Every boat carries a small gun for saluting purposes on return to their country and arms, according to the number of the crew in her, as piracy in Basrah is notorious. Now they have posted soldiers in her, and taken her small arms to the number of 12, and delayed the boat. And now a letter from the Nakhoda of the boat has reached us, saying that they had seized them at the buoy, and towed the boat into Kasbah in front of the house of the servant of Sheikh Khazal, Euler of Mohammerah, and they left soldiers in the boat, and kept her in custody with him. And may you remain guarded!I No. 341, dated Busbire, the 1st October 1904. From -Captain A. P. Trevor, for Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Govern ment of India, a copy of a letter No. 83, dated 23rd September 1904, from His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, on the subject of the proceedings of the Persian Revenue steamer “Muzafferi” in the Shatt-el-Arab. 2 . In reply to a reference from me, Mons. Waffelaert, Director-General of Customs, states that the “Muzafferi” did, in fact, capture two Koweit dhows, one of which was released on payment (under protest) of a fine of 8,000 krans and the other of which was brought to Bushire to he detained till a fine of krans 18,000 is paid. Mons. Waffelaert added that it was not in his power to discuss the matter further at Bushire, as a report of the capture had already been despatched to Tehran, presumably from Mohammerah. 3. The position of British Consular officers in Persia with regard to Koweit subjects is at present so undefined that, in view of Mons. Waffelaert’s attitude, it seems unlikely that very much will be effected here. 4 . A copy of this communication, with its enclosure, has been sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. No. 83, dated tbe 23rd September 1904. From—W. McDouall, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, To —Major P. Z Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul-General for Fars, Kbuzistan, &amp;c. With regard to the seizure of native craft by Customs S.S. “ Muzafferi ”, I have the honour to report that the owner of a Koweit bum made a complaint to His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah who sent him to me. I have no instructions as to whether Koweit subjects are entitled to more than good offices, and enquired from the Customs authorities if they would accept my intervention on behalf of Koweit subjects. Mons. Waffelaert, Acting Director-General, Bushire, informed me that at Bushire, as he had no orders from Tehran to recognise the right of His Majesty’s Consulate-General to represent Koweit subjects, there was an understanding that, pending instruc tions, any action of the Consulate-General should be unofficial, and suggested that the same should be done here to which I agreed. Mons. Waffelaert said that, as it would take some time to settle the case, and reference would have to be made to Tehran, to avoid delay to the vessels, he was prepared to accept payment of a fine under protest, the fine to be twice the value of the rifles, estimated at thirty tomans each, and the vessels could then be liberated ; when the case had been settled, and amount of fine fixed if anything to be returned to the owner it would be returned. The owner of bum accepted this on my advice, and has received a receipt, stating that the amount was paid under protest. The owners are Abdulla-biu-Muhammad and Alwan-bin-Hosein who state that they bought the vessel two years ago from Abdul Aziz Angri, in whose name the register was issued by Sheikh Mubarak. The vessel is the bum “ Teyser”, Nakhoda Ali-bin-Muhammad Mubarak. She was bound from Koweit for Sabiliyat near Basrah to load dates. The case for the vessel is that they carried twelve rifles and twelve hundred cartridges for the defence of the vessel and did not coneal that they had these rifles on board : that they were bound for Sabiliyat in Turkish territory, where their owner is awaiting them and had no intention of communicating with Persian territory : that the river being the border they were not in Persian waters : that as they were to load dates for sale at the Bedouin villages between Ras-el-*Had and Partag and on, they had brought these arms for protection.The Customs case is that the rifles were concealed and were new with the full complement of cartridges : that as the importation of arms is prohibited in Tu kev as well as Persia it is of no importance where they were bound. If the vessel can prove that the rifles were not for sale, I am of opinion that twelve rifles are not an excessive amount, as piracies often occur oft the mouth of the ShaH el Arab and all vessels therefore should carry sufficient arms to protect themselves ; a’nd the Bedouin coast is also unsafe. ' A second bum, Nakhoda Ghanim, is also understood to belong to Koweit. She had twenty-eight rifles concealed on board, and this fact is not denied, she had some bundles of hides consigned to Basrah to which port she was hound. She was captured near the inner buoy and can only put forward that she was bound for a Turkish port and was not within Persian jurisdiction. This yessel has been taken to Bushire, as the owner cannot pay a fine. The fine demanded would come to more than the yalue of the vessel, and the owner’s entire capital was invested in these rifles and the vessel which is mortgaged already. The “ Teyser ” proceeds to Sahiliyat where I can communicate with her; she will be there for at least a fortnight. I enclose herewith the deposition of the Nakhoda and, if necessary, he will swear an affidavit m these terms. The owner states he can get evidence at Koweit that the rifles were pur chased for the defence of the vessel only. If the presence of the owner, Nakhoda, and others is necessary in Bushire to support or prove their claim for a refund of the fine and return of the arms, I would beg to be informed as soon as possible. Deposition of Ali-bin-Muhammad Mubarak , Nakhoda of the bum “ Teyser” of Koweit. I, Ali-hin-Muhammad, Nakhoda of the bum “ Teyser ”, state as follows:— The vessel left Koweit for Sahiliyat to load. On the 10th September, Saturday, was off the Turkish fort at Pao tacking up the river. At midnight two boats from the S.S. “ Muzafferi ” came and asked what I had. I said “ nothing ”. They then asked if I had any arms. I replied “ yes, we have twelve rifles for the eighteen men of the crew for the protection of the vessel, two are here and ten below”. They then searched the vessel and detained her three days and then brought her to Mohammerah. These arms were bought for the protection of the vessel, as she was hound for Yemen after loading, that is for the villages beyond Bas-el-Had and two years ago having no arms I was attacked and robbed there. I solemnly declare and am prepared to take oath that the above statement is true in every particular. ‘ Seal of Ali-bin-Muhammad. Deposed and sealed by the said Ali-hin-Muhammad at Mohammerah this twenty-third day of September 1904, before me. W. McDouall, His Britannic Majesty's Consul.

The Governor has to-day given me an evasive reply that Director General of Customs says that the matter does not concern the Governor and that I should apply to the Customs Department. 1 had already written demi-ofiicially on the subject to the Director General without eliciting a reply from him. I would suggest that the British Minister, Theran, should he moved by the Government of India to take necessary steps.

From—The Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—L. W. Dane, Esq., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of previous correspondence ending with my telegram of 10th instant on the subject of the proceedings of the Persian Revenue gunboat “ MozafFar ,} in the Shat-el-Arab, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter* from Captain Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, on the subject of the detention and search of a “ boom ” belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit. * No. 32, dated 26th September 1904, with enclo tares. 2. Captain Knox’s letter explains the case fully, and it is unnecessary for me to comment on it at length. In regard to the last paragraph, however, I beg to give the following remarks:— Acting on the complaint of Sheikh Mubarek sent to me by Captain Knox under cover of his letter No. 24, dated 14th September 1904 (a copy of which was sent to the Government of India with my letter No 336, dated 24th September 1904), I approached Monsieur Waffelaert on the subject of the alleged seizure of a “ boom ” and a “ helium ” belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit, and received the following reply:— “ As regards the “ boom ” and the “ helium ” belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit, I beg to inform you that the “ Mozaffar” has operated searchings in many dhows which she has come across, among which there have in fact been a “ boom ” and a helium ” of which one was coming from Basrah, and the other going to Maniouhi; from what I have been able to gather from the Com mander none of these (that is of the 2 mentioned) appertain to the Sheikh of Koweit, as also appears from the one’s origin and the other’s destination.” I am again addressing the Director-General of Customs in view information in Captain Knox’s letter, which was unfortunately delayed a week by missing the mail steamer at Fao. 3. I have had the opportunity of conversing with Captain Knox on this subject, and I think that undoubtedly popular feeling has been much roused in Koweit by the high-handed proceedings on the part of the Persian Customs Department, and especially by the minute search of a boat belonging to the Sheikh. 4. I trust, therefore, that the Government of India will be pleased to take such action as they think fit to prevent such occurrences in future, ^ and if necessary to cause the Customs Department to make some explanation and apology to the Sheikh for the behaviour of their employes on this occasion. 5. A copy of this communication has been sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. No. 32, dated the 26th September 1904, From-^CAPTAiN S. G. Knox, LA.., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Fars&gt; Khuzistan, etc., Bushire. I have the honour to forward herewith four statements of the Nakhoda and three sailors of the boom “ Musallini,” property of Sheikh Mubarek, which, it was alleged, was stopped by the servants of the Imperial Customs Department of Persia on or about the 15th instant. 2. The statements which were recorded separately present the usual discrepancies to be found when a number of ignorant witnesses, incapable of correct observation, are examined, but I see no reason to doubt the general Atruth of their story. Witness No. 2 is obviously unreliable, as it will be an easy matter to prove that the boom reached Fao and did not, as he asserts, return to Koweit at once without being searched. 3 . I would venture to suggest that there are two matters on which it is specially necessary to call for an explanation from the Customs Department. The reckless firing of ball cartridge into the air in the direction of Eao at such close quarters as the Shat-el-Arab must be a proceeding attended with con- siderable risk to person and property. As we have a telegraph station at Fao and Sheikh Mubarek’s followers and employes form, I understand, the bulk of the population of the place, on this score alone, apart from what ever protest, the Ottoman local authorities may see fit to present, I venture to think that we should be justified in protesting strongly against the action of the Customs’ servants. 4s. Further, I would ask that the Customs Department be called on for an explanation as to why Sheikh Mubarek’s private boom was searched at all. It is difficult to imagine that a well known boat like this, always on the run between Koweit and Fao, was not recognised by the crew of the Persian jolly boat even at a distance ; but, even granting this, after the explanation furnish ed hy the crew of the boom, the minute search conducted over Sheikh Mubarek’s private boat can only be construed by me into a deliberate and purposeless insult. 5. I have already explained in my letter No. 24, dated 14th instant, that popular feeling in Koweit is greatly excited over this incident and I have heard remarks, though not from any responsible quarter, asking why the English, who have been so long in the Gulf, permit such high-handedness on the part of the Persian Government. The report which has recently reached Koweit that an English man-of-war has appeared at the mouth of the Shatt and that the Belgians promptly decamped has been received with undisguis ed satisfaction. 6 . I have only to add that, with reference to Sheikh Mubarek’s letter of which a translation was forwarded under cover of my letter quoted in the preced ing paragraph at an interview I had with Sheikh Mubarek this morning, he in formed me that the mention of the bellum was based on incorrect information. The boom only was detained and searched. STATEMENT No. 1. Name Fathers name Age Occupation ... Residence Mi grin. Ibrahim-bin-Sauad, 30 years. Nakhoda.

The Nakhoda of the dhow to which the Sheikh refers is still in custody together with a companion, and the dhow is still detained. In answer to all queries the Director-General of Customs replies that the entire case was referred to his Central Administration at Tehran, and that he can take no action without orders from the Ministry which have not yet been received. Translation of extract from letter, dated 19th October 1904, from Mubareic us Subah, Ruler of Koweit, to Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit. 1. And as for the Belgians who seized the boats of our subjects in one of which was 10 rifles and in the other 24 rifles. 2. As for the 10 rifles, they belonged to one of the people of Bussorah and the Nakhoda was not aware of what had been added and wrapped up by the owner. 3. And the 24 rifles were in two boxes belonging to one of the people of Zubair ; the barrels were in one box and the butts in another and equally the Nakhoda of the boom knew nothing about it except that there were two boxes containing goods. 4. And the boat of the Belgians seized them and fined the boom in which there were 10 rifles, 0,000 krans and released it. And the Belgians took the other boom to Bushire and imprisoned the Nakhoda and demanded from him krans 12,000. 5. Now the crew of the boom are my subjects and are under the protec tion of the Government. It is, therefore, necessary that the Belgians should hand over the boats either to the Consul of the British Government at Moham- merah or to the Resident in Bushire, and the punishment they deserve should be at your hands, for we also are prohibiting all our ships from the carrying of arms and restraining them ; but, in a case like this, it will be hard on them, for they do not know what the consignor loads and we remain watching events as they pass over us unjustly and have explained the state of affairs to you.

In continuation of my letter No, 355, dated 14th October 1904, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the following report on the subject of the search of a boom belonging to Sheikh Mubarek by the Persian Customs ship Muzaffer. On the 27th October I addressed Monsieur Waffelaert giving him a precis of the statements of the crew of the Sheikh’s boom and pointing out that the boom was apparently examined close to Fao and asking him to enquire into the matter. On the 3rd of November (on the return of the Muzaffer to Bushire) Monsieur Waffelaert replied, and I have the honour to enclose a copy of bis communication for the information of the Government of India. Monsieur Waffelaert appears to be under the impression that any native craft can be searched in any place on suspicion of having e&lt; contraband ” on board. The Sheikh’s “ boom ” plies between Kowait and Eao taking mails, bring ing firewood, etc., and even if it had firearms on board, it seems to me that the matter would lie between Sheikh Mubarek and the Turkish authorities. The action of the Muzaffer undoubtedly caused a great deal of irritation throughout the Arab Coast, and if such high handed actions on the part of the Customs continue, I think the Arabs may possibly attempt some kind of reprisals. If therefore the Government of India agree that indiscriminate searching of native craft in the Shat el Arab is contrary to International Law and custom, I trust that they will be pleased to take steps to prevent the Persian Customs Department from abusing the rights of search in this way. Dated the 3rd November 1904. p r0 tn —Monsieur E. Waffelaert, Director-General of Customs, Bushire, To— Captain A. P. Trevor, First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my letter No. 6642 of the 27th ultimo I beg to state that from the inquiry instituted from the Commander of S. S. Muzaffer it follows that the boat has detained many «* booms ” and “Bellums ” but has never kept them longer than it was necessary for searching the inside of the craft. The Commander of our boat does not recollect anything particular about the boom Mosalim, but the mere fact of the crew’s shouting out that the vessel belonged to Sheikh Mubarek was not sufficient to prove that the boat did not carry contraband goods. Besides, beyond searching in the boat no barm whatever has been done neither to the craft or to the crew.No. 397, d&amp;ted Bushire, the 20th November 1904. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, In confirmation of my telegram of the 14th Novemher 1904,1 have the honour to state, for the information of the Government of India, that the Director-General of Customs has informed me that the Koweit dhow belong ing to Abdul Aziz bin Farah of Koweit, which has been detained here, will now be confiscated. Instructions have been issued by the Central Customs Administration that the Nakhoda of the dhow will be imprisoned until the fine of 18,000 krans is paid, or until further orders. 2 . I submit that this is an exceedingly high-handed proceeding as there was absolutely no evidence brought forward at the investigation at Moham- merah {vide Mr. Consul McDouall’s report sent with my letter No. 341, dated 1 st October 1904) to show that the rifles were intended for Persia. 3. Monsieur Waffelaert also declares that “ all articles on board ” will also be confiscated under Article 1Y of the Act of the 5th Kamzan 1317. I have pointed out that only articles used to conceal the contraband goods should be confiscated, but Monsieur Waffelaert does not agree, and the question has been referred to Tehran. There were on board the dhow 4 hales of canvas belonging to one Haji Mukhbil of Bahrein consigned by him to Suleiman bin Mahmud-el Thakeir of Busreh, and it was in connection with a request made by me that Haji Mukhbil’s canvas should be returned, that the question of Article IY of the Act of 5th Eamzan came up.
