Dear Robin, British Embassy, — -Tehran, 3rd March, 1944. n N . For some time we■have-r^oe^ved pressing areals from Bushire ConsulateWlerier#! for the supply of Army rations. As you know, Bushire is in a desolate part of the country, and owing to transport difficulties, the Consulate-General has great trouble in obtaining food, and what it does get is at exorbitant prices. We have at last succeeded in persuading Paiforce to issue them with Army rations for the next three months, but they are unwilling to do this on a permanent basis without a ruling from the War Office, and they ask that the Foreign Office should try and obtain such a ruling from the War Office. 2. I realise that this raises a thorny Question of principle which the Foreign Office have already discussed with the War Office; my recollection of the position, when I left London last October, was that the War Office had agreed to supply Army stores to our missions at Moscow and Jedda, but had refused, e.g. in the case of our Consulate-General at Madagascar. If, however, the Foreign Office can take up the matter again on behalf of Bushire, we should be grateful. Yours ever, (Signed) John Somers Cocks.94.

The merchant class have, almost all, lost their private Occ foreign trade, also their forwarding trade, rhe latter has, s as a result of the constructions of the trans-Iran*' Hail- ways shifted to ivhorramshahr. The merchants have therefore invested part of their money in the newly formed Companies in Tehran, Isfahan and ohiraz, hut this does not compensate them for the trade tuey have lost. Shopkeepers and traders axe in &amp; worse plight as the smuggling of contraband goods is flourishing in the hinter land, and hardly any of the peasantry come in to make their purchases at Bushire.

The Governor has expressed his entire approval to the proposed importation for the Residency staff as every article so imported will help to relieve the demand on the resources he is endeavouring to obtain. that he has had no reply to his many representations to Tehran.

Sir, 1 have the honour to address you regarding the economic situation at i ushire, which is becoming daily -nore serious and causing me some apprehension* 2* Ho rain has fallen at all this winter, a thing that is, I believe, almost without precedent, and which the oldest inhabitant cannot recall* he t *rn of Buehire is aliaost entirely dependent on rainfall for its water supply and most of the larger houses have attached to tnea water reservoirs ( ab ambers ) which are filled by rainfall from the roof and from which the poorer members of tne population are also allowed to draw* Last ye; r the rainfall was not abundant, but adequate, but a good many of tnese water reservoirs were not filled entirely* they are now all of them quite empty* 5* In addition to these reservoirs there are in the island three or four wells, which usually supply the needs of 1 &gt;oal villagers but cannot possibly furnish sufficient water for the town* neither is it possible to deepen them because if deepened the water becomes brackish* home years ago some geologists belonging to the Anglo- i'eraian Oil Comj^any carried out a rough surrey of the island and submitted a report regarding the possibility of digging more wells» but they came to the conclusion that it was improbable that any further borings were likely to produceproduce eeeet water. Moot wel» in tflo ielond, and am^no those of the Heoidency garden, are Tory braciish, ain* tae water is quits undr inkatle# iutihire is thsrsfors cyofrontsd with an acute water faaine, and the tiorernor ims neon considering U.e possibility of geUin* water from elsewhere, he estiiot. ict the requirements of water at 4000 gallons a day at the present moment, 8000 in two months’ time and 12,000 gallons in the middle of summer when the wells will haYs entirely dried up. 5 , In the first place he considered the possibility of etting water by sailing boats from the uhatt-al-Arab ae Kuwait does, this method,however, ie not »ery satiefactorj as Bushire does not possess nearly ae :»ny dhows as i&lt;Luimit, and secondly, if the weather ie stormy or if there is a flat calm. Bailing boats are frequently very seriously delayed. He then approached the representative of »e ere.oelglers, who are the Aagle-lerelaa Oil Com t &gt;ony’s agents, m.d asked him whether the /.nglo-lerslan Oil Company could assist. The Anglo-1 ersian Oil Company hove expressed their willingness to supply tins,etc. for the carriage of water and have stated that they could send down 29,000 gallons in a tug which would visit Bushire shortly, but that if the local authorities wish them to supply a tug to tow sailing boais backwards and forwards permanently the charge weuld be £ 300 a month, which the Oovv.nnor states that he cannot possibly ai a.-, to pay. 6. He has therefore now approached the British India Steam Navigation Company, and the local Agents are enquiring whether it would be possible for the clow ?.ix last mails each to bring down 100 tone a week from i'aerah. This i *OUl&lt;land • e • would certainly seem to be the cheapest arrangement that could oe made, and X hope the Coa.any #111 be able to assist. 1 ' i he re reiMiins Uie question oi' io«detuife, wnich is equally serious. As a rule at this time of the year the Llami of Bashir, is corered with crops, which are sufficient for local requirements and it is seldom necessary to obtain supplies from the mainland. This year not a single acre has been sown and not only that but the rains hare also failed in the mainland and X under stand there ie a ahortage at ihiras and elsewhere, and suoh scanty supplies as are avail able will be sent into the interior. i i'iceu ai « .n consequence beginning to soar, as tia© folio mg figures will show* 1951, ^ow» Krs, Krs* Baricy • • 15 40 fheat • • 24 50 of Boosa •• 4 16 Che atove figures are for a -Haehmi- maund of 128 pounae. Actually barley is unobtainable at the present moment, and live stock is being killed and sold at almost nominal prices. Ihe Governor informed me yesterday that he had sene telegrams to various places in the interior asking whether they could send supplies to Buenire, but he did not anticipate that they would be able to assist. He L therefore also making enquiries as to ths poeslbility of getting supplies from Basrah and on rsosipt of a reply proposes to ebtaln epeo ^i permission from the Persian Government for the import of foodstuffs. Under an. ordinary administration this would be quite eatief aetory, but in view of the fact that the Central Authorities in Tehran are entirely unacquainted with,ana apparently aleo entirely indifferent to, the special conditions prevailing in the Oulf it rewains to be seen whether they will grant the requisite permission, and in any case it is quite possible that, if they do grant it, it will be only after considerable delay* Xh^r will doubtless argue that there are ample eupplies available in &amp;llan or some other place in Borthern i^ereia, ignoring the fact that the Buahire peaeantry cannot possibly afford to consume wheat grown in Northern Persia and transported thence to the South* 1 have asked the Governor to keep me in close touch with the position ao that if neceaaary I may apply sor self for special permission to import foodstuffs for the use of the Residency stall • d* ihroa the above it will be seen that even if the Persian authorities n»ke some arrangements to feed the population of the actual town Bushire it is highly probable that famine conditions will prevail all along the coast and in many of the tribal areas, and these may give rise to disturbances and robberies, and result in general insecurity throuc^iout the bouth* A hungry Tangistuni with a flfle In his hand is not likely to remain passive* Only three or four days ago the Bushire-lhiras postal van proceeding to Shlra* was attacked by daooite* Two Amnieh guards were wounded, one of whom has since died, while one of the passengers, a Tehrani accountant of the National dank of Persia, was also killed. i* oushiri sweetmeat maker was robbed of 50 Tomans on 15th February by a robber who has disappeared without being arrested* Vhile the above may be regarded as isolated incidents they are certainly symptomatic and X think there is every likelihood that unless the Central^ 4 £ Central SoTenusent taka prompt meaauraa to import fo dotuifo at prices ahicH the peaeantry can afford to pay, ut '•‘ li be wholesale robbing fnd looting of carawane rery shortly. 2 ' j oelieve the feraian authorities are considering the possibility of removing the troops from ' u ^ lire t - m,n and reducing the Road Cuarde eimply because they are unaule to feed them here. If they do, it will »ke the position still more serious since practically all the Kuropeaos in aushire live at considerable distances from the town and in isolated houses and with no yersian force to protect them, and surrounded by/starving population the situation will giVQ rise to ooneiiierabl® ttruciety* X am sending copies of this despatch to lis Majesty's secretary of State for India, the Government of India and His Majesty's Consul, -ihxraa* I I have the honour to be, dir, four most obedient, humble servant, sd/- H, V, Biscoe, Lt.
