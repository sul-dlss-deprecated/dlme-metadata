Garbett I enclose for your information a copy of a letter from Mr.Garbett containing his instructions to his bankers to pay the amount of income tax due. Yours sincerely,J \ Mr« Wakely. I understand that the letter to Mr, G-arbett which the Colonial Office intend to issue will be sent by next week f s mail and that you will write simultaneously to him to explain that his case has been reviewed personally by the two Secretaries of State concerned and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. You might perhaps consider whether you could ad.d to your letter a sentence dealing with the legal aspect of his case somewhat on the following lines:- w You will, of course, understand that the representations which have been made on your behalf have been confined exclusively to the question of the equity of the charge and no been u As I think you know, the Board of Inland Revenue are not the final arbiters in a matter of this kind and an appeal would lie to the Special ■&gt; Commissioners of Income Tax, subject to an appeal to the High Court on a point of law. Without going/going fully into this question, which would be a matter in which you would probably find it desirable, if you decided to pursue it, to take professional advice, I might indicate that there would seem to be an arguable case for appealing against the assessment on the ground that the office or employment of profit which you held was not one within the- scope of the charge under Schedule E of the Income Tax Acts since the emoluments were not in the first instance derived from the public revenues of the United Kingdom.^96662/32.

We shall now send a reply to Mr. Garbett, but the letter will not go off To My.Qarbett. _ for another week. I enclose a copy of the letter which has been approved. If anybody is writing to him privately from the India Office, it might be as well to let him know that the matter has been reviewed by the highest authorities personally. We can do no more for him. You E.P. DONALDSON,. BSQ.Copy. Downing Street, 7 th November, I 932 , My dear Chancellor, i hate to trouble you with a very minor matter out this is a case where I really feel that an injustice is being done and our two departments are unable to settle it. The case is that of an officer of the Indian civil oervice called C.C.Garbett who served in Iracj from 1920 to 1922 . You will be able to send for the papers about it (Treasury reference 3.6040) so I do not propose to go into it in detail in this letter. The facts are not in dispute. Put very briefly, Mr. Garbett was serving on loan from India at a special rate of pay agreed upon in I 920 . After Iraq and the Middle East were transferred to the Colonial Office half the cost of some posts - including the one held by Garbett - was borne by His Majesty’s *** Government. This involved liability for British Income Tax on that half. Before this point was finally settled Garbett reverted to the Indian service and then, a long time afterwards, was faced with a claim for British Income Tax on half his salary from April 1921 to May 1922 (when he reverted). This doesn’t seem fair. If he had known about this liability he could have protested, or got his salary raised to meet it (perhaps) or gone back to India at once. But, being in ignorance, he stayed on in Iraq and drew his pay at the same rate till May 1922 . The THE RIGHT HONOURABLE NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN, M.P.[lUMIlLUUM 'ynwumiw The Treasury view, I understand, is that the liability is a legal one and that the law must take its course. I suppose that this view is legally right but I think you will agree that it is inequitable, and surely some way can be found to let the man off the demand for £ 2 y 4 with which he is now faced. Yours ever. (Sgd.) P. CUNLIFFE-LISTBR.Copy. TREASURY CHAMBERS, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1 st December, I 932 . My dear Secretary of State, I have looked into the case of Mr. Garbett about which you wrote to me on the 7 th November. Without wanting to appear unsympathetic I fear that I cannot see my way to regard Mr. Garbett's case as open to reconsideration. The papers make it clear that many other officers in Iraq were concerned. In regard to one of them, a Major Boyle, whose case has been regarded by the Colonial Office as equally strong with that of Mr. Garbett, Winston Churchill wrote so long ago as the 25 th October, 1926 , in a letter to Inskip, then Solicitor General, as follows: 'I quite appreciate the measure of hardship involved in such a case, but I fear that the law makes it impossible for me to authorise the remission of the tax. You will realise that now that some three- quarters of the officers affected by the decision have already paid, whether by deduction from their salaries or otherwise, the tax due from them on these grants, it would be quite inequitable to them if the tax were now to be remitted in the case of those who have not paid.” Just because the 'measure of hardship” to the officers was appreciated all round, the question of any possible relieving action was again considered at length and in detail, two years later, by the Treasury and the Inland Revenue. The Inland Revenue were clear that direct relief from the tax due under the law could not possibly be justifiedjustified, and the Treasury wrote eventually to the colonial Office on the 25 th October, I 929 , that they had come to the conolusion that they would not be justified in asking Parliament to vote monies for the relief of the officers concerned. Xhe Treasury decision was definite, and was of course followed, on the part of the Kevenue, by a resumption of the work of collecting arrears. It would have been more satisfactory if the change in the Income Tax position had been notified to Mr. Garbett when it occurred. It is, however, highly conjectural whether if this had been possible the result have been any different. The Treasury would not have felt able, in the particular circumstances of the , to sanction an equivalent increase in emoluments. Incidentally, apart from Mr. Garbett T s case, the one or two cases still outstanding are in a fair way to be settled by payment. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) N. Chamberlain. The Right Hon.

Garhett for exemption from United Kingdom Income Tax, Mr C.C. Garbett, O.M.G. ,C.1 .E., is a highly placed official of the Indian Civil Service. In 1920, while the India Office were still running Iraq, he was lent hy India to Iraq to act as Civil Secretary to the High Commissioner ('nlaced on deputation 5 ’ is the Indian phrase). His service in Iraq counted as Indian service and there was no idea of a permanency in Iraq. The question of his pay cameap as, of course, he would exoect to get more while serving in Iraq and the Treasury in a letter dated 16th September 1920 agreed to a salary of Rs2500 per mensem on the understanding that it was temporary, personal to Mr Garhett, and inclusive of everything ’’the expenditure being a charge on Mesopotamian funds ?T . Mr Garbett stayed on in Iraq till may 1922 when he reverted to the Indian Civil Service. He drew his Bs.2,500 per month up to his reversion. But soon after the transfer of the Middle East to this office, , it was agreed that His Majesty’s Governmentjwould pay half the cost of the officers on the High Commission Staff (of whom Mr Garbett was one) as from 1st April, 1921. (There was a lot of trouble over the exact methods of accounting to be followed but it is not necessary to enter into that). The result of this decision was that as to half their nay these salaries were met from funds provided by Parliament and therefore became liable to British Income Tax on that half. No attempt was made to deduct the tax at source as from the start - this wouldwould have been impossible in practice at that time - and, in point of fact, it was not till September 1921 that the Treasury first pointed out the liability, and not till late in 1922 that, after much wrangling, it was decided that it must be enforced. Mr G-arbett had then returned to India. So Mr G-arbett became legally liable for Income Tax on half his nay - the method of calculation is one-half of the British Income Tax on the whole of his nay - from 1st April 1921 to May 1922 and suddenly received a claim for £274 in resnect thereof after he had reverted to India. This claim he objects to paying. If he had known about it while he was still serving in Iraq he could have asked for a re-adjustment of salary to meet it or could have reverted to India at once. Bu u he didn’t know so he could not adont either course. When the liability became known it was agreed[ \ that the fact could be taken into account when settling the salaries of the High Commission Staff and they were all revised - but not retrospectively - in 1923. The attitude of the Treasury is that the deduction of Income Tax is a statutory liability which they have no power to waive, and that they would not be justified in asking Parliament to vote the money lor a refund. Mr Garbett naturally cannot see the point of this. He never had an opportunity of objecting or asking for more pay or reverting to India, and his case must I think be acknowledged to be thoroughly sound. At one time we got an agreement to drop the claim but then another officer (Major Boyle) raised a similar issue and the Treasury then decided that the law must take its course.S0C4 '-52 96662/32.

The first has a bearing on the legal as^ct of the claim to income- tax, and toe eeeona on the eoiuty of the charge* (1) The liability of officers empiu/ed at the High Coiniseion in Baghdad to British mcome-tai in respect of half their mih+rivt- depends upon the source from which these salaries were actually disbursed during the period after 1st April, 1921* Prom that date, 1 understand that half the cost of the high Co^ission was home by united Ktn$m revenues, in accordance with the decision of ['is i ajesty 1 s Govenv^ent; but since 1 r• Garbett f s/ F.J.

Or, r ' C2 (Sgd.) E.P. Donaldson.Ve n tX* ^ Mr. C.C. GarbetVs income-tax. ttm* r^Oecretory of State, I have asked Mr. Pedlar of the Colonial Office, who is at present dealing with the case, to let us have a X . L r, U&gt;JJL copy of the Colonial Office letter of 30th May to which Mr. GarbetVs letter is a reply. I understand, however, that it is merely a reaffirmation of the Treasury decision of 1929, to the effect that the assessment to income-tax on Mr. Garbett in respect of the year 1921-22 must stand. The case is dealt with in papers P. 2191/20 in the file below, but the facts may be briefly recapitulated as follows. Mr. Garbett was sent to Iraq on special duty as Civil Commissioner to - y i ) the High Commissioner at Baghdad in October 1920* on a salary of Rs.2500 per mensem, to which the Treasury raised no objection, on the understanding that the expenditure was a charge on Mesopotamian funds. From 1st April, 1921, however, half the cost of the High Commission was borne by British revenues, and the officers employed appear to lave become assessable to United Kingdom income-tax in respect of 50% of their salaries. Mr. Garbett protested against the decision to charge him to income-tax, which was not communicated to him until 1923, but after prolonged discussion, in which the Colonial Office and this Office supported Mr. Garbett’s claim to be relieved of theliability, the Treasury' replied that they would not be justified in asking Parliament to vote the amount of the tax to or on behalf of the officers concerned, of whom Mr. Garbett was one. If it is the case that a moiety of Mr. Garbett’s salary was from 1st April, 1921. actually F id from United Kingdom revenues, the decision to assess him to income-tax in/HflBHBBBBBBMMTfi imUHUHBSBSflnaBBW LWtmmmniuBmimfw mji in the Colonial Office, as the Department from which the issue of pay was made, appears to be legally correct, but if the pay was in fact issued from Iraq funds and subsequently reimbursed from the British Treasury, I think a case could be made out for holding that the charge to income-tax is not in accordance with the rules applicable to Schedule E in the Income-Tax Act, 1918, and Mr* Garbett could, in that event, appeal to the Special Commissioners against the assessment, and could test the vaL idity of the proposed charge. As regards recovery of the tax, which amounts to some no action can be taken by the Inland Revenue authorities unless and until Mr* Garbett returns to this country, so that his position as regards payment of the sum claimed is a strong one, and as he is not convinced of the justice of the claim, it is open to him to withhold payment until he returns to the United Kingdom. I understand that the Colonial Office are inclined to think that the charge is inequitable, and might be prepared to approach the Treasury again, with a view to its being waived; but it may perhaps suffice at the present stage if we were to communicate to the Colonial Office the substance of this note, in case they may feel inclined to make any use of it in a further discussion with the Treasury and Inland Revenue authorities. It seems unnecessary, pending further action by the Colonial Office, to trouble the Secretary of State with the matter, in spite of Mr. Garbett’s request.

I enclose copy of a letter 1 am sending to the Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, with copy to Messrs G r indlay &amp; Co-, for the Income-tax Department* I should be very grateful if the Secretary of State would see the file, as I frankly feel that I am being unfairly treated and bullied* I should like to be assured that my file has really been dealt with equitably: and, if only I could be persuaded that the payment is just, it would make it easy to accept the decision which not only I but also my friends consider shameful* Yours sincerely. L.D. Wakley, Bsquire, C*B., Assistant Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, London*urmmuim Grant Lodge, Simla last 11 th August 1932• To The U&amp;uer ^ oi Colonial offioe, Lonuo^. Sir 1 have the honour to reply to Mr. Flood’s letter JSo. 88^24/31. dated the 30th May 1952, on the subject of the extraction from me of £274 income tax ultimately due fro,, the Colonial Office, in aatiafactiun of the claim made by the Income -1 a ZNipartment on account of the salary drawn by me in Iraq in 1921-22. 3. Mr. Flood’s letter suggests that the India Office letter of 1929 should be considered as closing the correspondence. The position previously taken up by the Colonial Office, as understood by tm 9 was th*« t whi~e the equity of my c .aim was admitted, yet at the time it was inconvenient for the Colonial Office to apply to Parliament for the additional tundu required. It appeared incomprehensible U t a claim, which was admittedly equitable, wou q toe permanently shelved, ana on t is account 1 have not considered the correspondence closed. 3. realising tiiat my views on this question might be biassed and anxious thi t my financial interests should not affect my judgment. I have &gt;een careful to consult others - one H. the Governor of a Province: and another friend a justice of a Hi^h Court, who lias had oor.siderable practical experience at home as well as abroad. Both advise me not to pay, and v a after is emphatic that not tx iy would the courts not sis force the c aim of the Income-tax ISNipartasat in tne eireumetaaoeo but ti^t if oray my case had been studied by a sufficiently highly placed official, it wou d net have been allowed to go on as long as it hae. 1 et&amp;te this not by way of os argument in support of my caaa but by way of an aseura* oe that 1 imve taxen ; ,ains to avoid prejualce. 4 . 1 therefore venture briefly to recapitulate the facts. Hie Majesty’s Government in the Deportment of the India Office induced me to take service in Mesopotamia for its advantage at o tiixm when such service was most inconvenient to me. HisMajesty’s GoTermaent before lay departure gave iae ar, under taking as regards tde auisry eto. I was to draw# There was the no mention of income-tux, but bot^or*pioy^i * as the permanent Under Secretary of State of the India Office assured the Colonial Office * and X, the employed» understood pay refexred to in the documents to he rett pay* I uriuerstand that this fact, which is not denied by the India Office, who directly ^ployed ms, is not contested by the Colonial Office who succeeded the India Office as the Ministry in charge. During the course of my amployiaeiit and without coi suiting m the source of payment was so altered as to make a moiety of iry pay a charge .n aritish funds and therefore proper iy l.ia &gt;1 e to the demands ox the Inc(Xiie**tam Department® The correctness of tha,t demand 1 do not challenge. I do assert that it is the business of the Colonial uifice, the successor of the India Office® to meet that dau&amp;nd. How I am an Indian Civil servant working again ao ouch under the Secretary of 3tato for India who sent me to Mesopotamia, and as such am at a disadvantage. ^ere I situated otherwise and had I a gr evance which could not be settled outside the Courts® it would be open to me to sue my employer® namely the Secretary of State. The cause ox action would arise not out of my service as ar Indian oivi .ian but out of other capacities. But as I am now in service in India® 1 am bound by rules wlueh make it impossible for me to assert my rights by suit against the Secretary of State for India. If® as they threaten, the Income-tax officials sue me, I am again in difficulties. My rightful defence would be to implead the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for Colonies. The most important witness would be myself® but the conditions of my service forbid me from bringing the Secretary of State for India into a court and my posting Chief Secretary to the Punjab Government makes it impossible for meet the present critical juncture to apply for leave. The pressure which is being brought to bear on me by the Income-tax Departmei t appears to me and to my friends to be grossly inequitable and it has been remarked that the conduct41 &amp; I •+%m Maublted by Hi a Majesty’s OOTerisnent toward* me, a* under stood by u*. Is conduct which, if exhibited by an indiridual in hi* private life, would snow hiia to be 30 devoid of virf,.; t.mj aorai worth a* to uake hia unfit for the society of aecent men* In India the Governors of Provinces are sworn M to do ri^ht*, and here Goverruhent senrante ar« accuetomed only to right dealing. My first request therefore is that, if possible , it be sh wn to me tr.at in eome way I nave mis» understood the case and that there is some justification for the procedure adopted. At present neither I nor my friends and you wi^l admit that I have taken the trouble to consult influential persons - e n see any, and it docs hurt to feel that Hia Majaaty&lt;s Government in pursuit of a few odd puunds are tyrannising and doing that which is not right. My second request is that I say be informed, if possible, how high in tli heir; rohy my file h a gone. It would be some satisfaction to k^ow that the orders passed are in fact the orders of in a Secretary of State and nut those of some subordinate official acting for him. I promised, when I w^s informed in 192), to start collecting my money for the eventua. discharge of tills debt, if in equity it can be shown to be due from me. I have fulfilled my part of that pledge, and have collected the money. If I c«.n be satisfied on the two points which I nave raised and if the money is to be forced from me, it will be paid. I aia sending copy of this letter to the Under Secretary of State for India in the hope that he will be good enough to lay it before Sir damuel Hoare. I have the honour to be.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir P hilip Gunliffe- Lister to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th March which has been forwarded to this Department by Messrs Grindlay and Company, Limited, regarding the amount of £274,17.4d due from you in respect of British income tax, and to state that, as you were informed by the India Office at the end of 1929, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury then decided that they would not. be justified in asking Parliament to vote monies for the pay ment to you or for the discharge on your behalf of the amount of your income tax liabilities. 2. The provisions of the Statutes, which Their Lordships have no power to suspend, relating to the levy of Income Tax must accordingly apply to your income in respect of the period in question in so far as it fails within the scope of these Acts. 1 am, etc., (Sgd) J.E.W.
