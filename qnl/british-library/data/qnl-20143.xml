From the Offg; Political Resident in Turkish Arabia to the Secretary to the Government of India,in the Foreign Department,Calcutta,No.27,dated the 31st January 1899. Sir, I have^the honour to inform you that I have received, through. Her i .ajesty's Consul at Basrah, a copy of your telegram, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,in which. L am. directed, to submit a report on a proposal that Government should declare a protectorate over Koweit. j .here can, I think, he no doubt that a protectorate would be of immense advantage to us,but I fear that this could not be done without difficulty. I am aware that Her i.ajesty's Government has never acknowledged Koweit to be under Turkish protection,but I am convinced that the Porte would claim that it is so and would resist any attempt on our \ part to protect the Sheikh. Indeed,if the Turks were to hear positively that the Sheikh was about to place himself under our pro tec ti,on r i t Is, vea?y-lik.eiy- my belief that they would promptly, remove him by force. This they could easily do,for I am. nilorraea that. Koweit. is. unprotected, on: the land side,and. the Turks could brine a large body, of troops: against, it in a comparatively short, tims., Hi, this connection,I may mention that there are persistent: rumours- that the E arrlson of Basrah ■ is about, to be increased,and it seems probable that these rumours, are not without foundation,for the status of the iiasrah,, command has been recently raised,a Commander -in-Chief posted there. a.- Although Her Majesty's Government has never acknowledged Koweit to be under Turkish protection,the Turks woula perhaps have reason to protest against another power declaring a protectorate over the place. So long ago as 1856 thoughthough their allegiance was stated to be merely nominal and though,apparently,they paid no tribute,the inhabitants of Koweit acknowledged the sovereignty ol 1 the Ottoman Porte, -yc- and used the Turkish flag; and the state of affairs was very much the same in 1887. Bombay Govt.Records ,h o .XXIV. New series Persian Gulf 1856. Page 296. uazetteer of Arabia.Page 44. Recently the Turks have taken a considerable amount of interest in the affairs of Koweit,and it is said that the rumoured increase in the Basrah garrison, is not. unconnected with a suspicion that we wish to take Koweit. under our protection. I am informed,too,(though I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the information) that the present Sheikh now pays tribute to the Turks. 4. As you are aware,the present Sheikh of Koweit, I iu bar ale, murdered his elder brother, Kuhanmad Pasha, in May 1896, and took possession of the Sheikhship. Kubarak immediately approached the Porte with a view to being recognised,and the heirs of Muhammad Pasha also appealed to the Turks. It would therefore apijear that the people - of Koweit themselves acy-now- -ledge Turkish sovereignty,though that sovereignty may 'be of a. somewhat shadowy character.

Sheikh Mubarak who in May last killed his two brothers I'uhamnad Pasha and Jerrah of Koweit,when they were ^Sheikh^fJKo^ in their harems,is communicating with the Sublime Porte assuring the Sultan that his late brothers were killed by the Bedouins when he was away from the town and that he (I.ubarak) was one of Eis Imperial Majesty's loyal subjects. Be therefore requested that he he appointed Sheikh of Koweit in. the place of his brother. Sheikh Saood and Sheikh Sabah,sons of the murdered SheiiOi,,ivaihamnad Pasha.,with two younger 'brothers have com- —plained cind appealed to tjie Sultan stating that their lather's murderer was their uncle Mubarak. They also claimed _ that their landed and other properties which have heen seized hy Mubarak may he restored to them as per title deeds they possess. They furthermore prayed that their uncle may be punished according to law adding that if their prayer was ' r el used the;y would do what they thought just.

His Excellency supported the late Pasha's sons. His Excellency also pointed out to the Porte certain 'benerits that would accrue from support being k given to the sons and tried to induce the Porte to establish formal departments at Koweit and to appoint a Mutasarif and station a battalion of infantry. He undertook to arrange this matter without difficulty by assisting the late Pasha's sons. It is reported that Sheikh Mubarak, has sent, thousands of liiras to some officials at Constantinople, and Baghdad, to support him in his endeavours to obtain from the Sublime Porte the recognition of his appointment. But the Pasha's sons are trying to punish him as the murderer of their father. (signed) M.Mark.7 V 00061 iviemorandum. by H.E.M's Consul,Basrah,dated the 12th July 1S.97:.

The elder brother Sheikh Sabah was unwell and unable to, visit, me as had originally intended. ^aood is an intelligent, looking, youth about 20. years, of age but has the appearance: of being rather a weak character'. After the usual compliments,: I. invited him to say anytning he had-: to say,whereupon, he told me that his father haa been murdered by Sheikh Mubarak,adding that he and his' brother Sabah. escaped by tie^ 1 n ^ ^ + - p u oy ile.„.ing to tne desert and claiming the protection, of some Bedouin Sheikh (he did nnt + ■ aici - not mention the name), who had his, brother and himself -afelv -aiely escorted to Dora the residence of thej-r ^ , their uncle ^usui bin Ibrahim Sheikh of that place. i.ubarak seized evervthinn« +1 ythlRg they had including some -ate, garaena near Pao.

Saood then went on to beg that the British Govt, would give the brothers their support declaring that his brother would unreservedly place himself under British protection and would do everything the British Government wished him to do. He also begged me to use my good offices to induce jamal Maimani a British Indian merchant here to rent the date gardens at Fao: his idea being that if Jamal Maimani rented the garden it would be incumbent on the British Govt, to see that his property was not interfered with in any way. I merely replied that I would inform my superior authorities what Sheikh Saood had said to me and would inform him of any reply they might send. I then asked Sheikh Saood where his Uncle Yusuf. bin Ibrahim was and he replied that he had no accurate information where he was, but he hsak admitted that his uncle had made thea? recent attack on Koweit and that he had with him seven baghlas and about 700 armed men.

Mr. de Bunsen to the Marquess of Salisbury.—(Received August 5.) (No. 426. Confidential.) My Lord, Constantinople, August 1, 1898. I HAVE the honotJr to transmit a translation which I have obtained privately of a Petition recently presented by Count Kapnist, nephew of the Russian Ambassador at Vienna, to the Ottoman Minister of Public Works, applying-/or the Concession of a railway from Tripoli, in Syria, to the Persian Gulf. The course of the proposed line is not quite clearly shown in the document, but as a right of preference is demanded for constructing branch lines to the north from Horns and Miadin (Meyadin), it would seem that it is intended to take the line through those two places. From Miadin its course seems to lie in the general direction of the Euphrates as far as Nedjef, whence there is to be a branch for Kerbelli and Bagdad. The line is to terminate at Koweit. Preferential rights are reserved for an extension from Bagdad to Mosul and Diarbekir. In the conversation with Dr. Zander, Director of the Anatolian Railway in Constantinople, of which I sent a summary to your Lordship in my telegram No. 153, Confidential, of the 30th ultimo, I inquired of that gentleman what he thought of this scheme. He said his Company were, of course, watching it, but that thev did not regard it as a very serious proposal, or one that was at all likely to be carried out. Mr. Marin itch, Acting First Dragoman, hears, however, that the Russian proposal is backed by French capitalists; that it is favourably viewed by a number of influential persons at the Porte ; and that the Russian Embassy will be instructed to support it. It is understood that Count Kapnist has waived his demand for a guarantee, and is now ready to build the line without one. I. shall have the honour to report further to your Lordship on the subject of Dr. Zander's proposals by next mail. * I have, &amp;c. (Signed) M. DE BUNSEN. Inclosure in No. 1. Petition. (Translation.) I REQUEST that a Concession may be granted to me for the construction and working of a line of railway from the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Bassorah, with a 6 per cent, guarantee from the Imperial Government, and upon the following conditions:— 1. The building and working of a line from Tripoli, in Syria, to Koweit, on the Persian Gulf, the line to be built to admit of a speed of 60 kilom. per hour; the building of a branch line starting from Hanekin, on the Persian frontier, passing through Bagdad and Moussaib (on the Euphrates) to Nejf and Kerbela; and the construction of ports at Tripoli, in Syria, aud Koweit. 2. The right of preference for the building and the working of the following- lines :— (a.) From Homs to Aleppo. (/3.) One from Miadin, passing through Deir northwards. (y.) One from Bagdad to Mosul and Diarbekir. (8.) One from Koot-el-Amara, on the Tigris, as far as the Euphrates, along the bank of the Shat-el-Hadi. (e.) One from Alexandretta or Suedia to Aleppo and Birejik. [1539 1]'V- 2 a 3. All State lands required for the construction of such lines and ports, and their appurtenances, as well as all State stone-quarries necessary, to be placed gratuitously at the disposal of the concessionnaire. 4. The line to be a single one, of broad guage, but the land given must admit of a second line being- built later on. 5. All tools and implements required for the construction of such lines and ports to be free from all customs and other duties. 6. The tariffs for passengers and goods to be the same as those now in force in Turkey. 7. The concessionnaire will form a Societe Anonyme' of Ottoman nationality, the internal Statutes of which will be submitted to the approval oi the Imperial Government. 8. The sole right of building stations and stopping-places by waters and rivers to be met with in the districts traversed by the railways, as well as store-houses and depots at the said stations, as well as the towns through which the line will pass, to be exclusively reserved to the concessionnaire. 9. The right of draining and irrigating the lands in the neighbourhood of the N Tigris, Euphrates, Shat-e' Hindie, and Shat-el-Arab, to belong to the concession naire, the conditions to be with those accepted by the Imperial Government in similar undertakings. 10. The concessionnaire will enjoy the right of making the necessary construc tions for improving the channel of the above-enumerated rivers and canals, and of navigating them. 11. The concessionnaire will enjoy the right of working any mines or deposits of petroleum or naptha to be discovered within 50 kilom. of the centre of the railway, the concession of which has not yet been accorded to any other person. I have submitted to His Imperial Majesty the contents of this Petition, and am ready to discuss with the competent Department the Contract to be drawn up, and the terms and conditions of the cahier des charges.ASIA. [October 17.] COM EIDENTIAL. S ection 2. No. 1. Sir N. O'Conrtf to the Marquess of Salisbury.—{Received October 17.) (No 525.) My Lord, Therapia, October 6, 1898. I HAVE had the honour to receive your Lordship's telegram No. 13, Com mercial, of the 1st instant, informing' me of the financial position of Messrs. S. Meger and Co., who are interested in Count Kapnist's railway scheme, and desire that their respectability may be vouched for if inquiries are made. I shall bear this information in mind, but 1 venture to remark that the under taking in question, of which some account is given in Mr. de Bunsen's despatch No. 426 of the 1st. August, is a very far-reaching one, extending over regions in the development of which British trade is deeply interested, and that it is likely, if carried out, to come in conflict with other railway projects for reaching the Euphrates and Persian Gulf, which would be more favourable to the British interests involved. I understand that a plan is now on foot for completing the Haiffa Railway to Damascus, and carrying it eventually across the desert to Bagdad and Basrah. It is too early to say whether this particular British enterprise is worthy of encouragement. But. if there is to be railway communication with the Persian Gulf, it would seem undesirable to leave it to be carried out by a Russian Company which leans on its own Government, who would reap the political advantages, for support, but seeks the necessary capital in England. 1 am informed that between 12,000,000/. and 20,000,000/. would be required to complete Count Kapnist's scheme. The Porte is understood to be resolutely opposed to granting kilometric guarantees in future. The financial success of the project is therefore more than doubtful. Its promoters would perhaps be satisfied if it attained the political result of keeping British Companies out of the field. I should hesitate at all events to encourage British participation in it until we know more of its scope and results. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. E. O'CONOR. No. 2. Sir N.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 525 of the 6th instant, with regard to the Haiffa-Damascus Railway, I have to report that having instructed Mr. 'Weakley, Commercial Attache at this Embassy, to make further investigations, I am now informed that the concessionnaire, Mr. Pilling, has declared his ability to construct his railway as far as the Jordan, and demands two years' extension of time in which to find the necessary capital so as to continue the line to Damascus. In view of the scheme presented by Count Kapnist, it has been suggested to Mr., Pilling to present an application for the continuation of his line to Bagdad and the Persian Gulf, and I understand he is on the point of doing so. [1649 /c—2]2 I further learn that Mr. Pilling, acting on behalf of the Thames Iron Works Company, has proposed to lend the Turkish Government 7,000,000/. at (3 per cent, interest witli 1 per cent, sinking fund, and that offers have been made b} him for the taking over of the arsenal, the reorganization and reconstruction of the Beet, as well as the rebuilding of the first bridge across the Golden Horn.

Williams, Meyer, and Co. to Foreign Office.— {Received October 27.) Sir 5 6, Tokenhouse Yard. London, October 25, 1898. 'WITH reference to the interview which, you were good enough to accord on Saturday last to our senior partner, Mr. Gerald Walton Williams, and to your request to be furnished with a summary of our position and intentions in connection with the projected railway from Tripoli' on the Mediterranean to Koneit on the Persian Gulf, we have the honour to inform you that the scheme, as detailed in the inclosed copy of Count Wladimir Ivanovitch Kapnist's application for the Concession to His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, was placed before us some time since by some mutual friends of the Count and ourselves, they being interested with the Count by private agreement in the realization of the project, with the view that our firm should consent to give them its financial support through the instrumentality of its influential connection, in the event of their obtaining the Concession. The scheme being one of international importance, and the Concession being applied for in the name of a Hussian subject, our first stipulation before entertaining the suggestion was that Her Majesty's Government should not be opposed to the realization of the project. On this head, we were informed that the scheme had been unofficially communicated to the Foreign Office both by a printed Memorandum in English giving particulars thereof, and by letters of Mr. Edward Easton to the Right Honourable the Marquess of Salisbury, which his Lordship had graciously acknowledged. We were further given to under stand that these communications had so far elicited no expression of disapproval on the part of the Government as to the proposed scheme, and that our informants had no reason to anticipate the raising of any official objections thereto in principle. We thereupon satisfied ourselves that Count Kapnist and his friends stood a reasonable chance of obtaining the Concession, and, having done so, we consented to give them the desired support, at the same time obtaining from Mr. Leopold de Rothschild (whose firm we must, however, state will not, at all events in the present stage, take any financial interest in the venture) a letter of introduction to Mr. Henry St. George Eoley at the Eoreign Office, in order that the Government ^should be apprised of our position in regard to the matter and satisfied in respect to -our financial reputation and standing. We were subsequently informed by Mr. Easton that the Eoreign Office had acquainted their Excellencies the British Ambassadors at Constantinople and at St. Petersburgh that the Government had cognizance of the scheme, and that it appeared to be backed by responsible persons. Our Mr. Williams had been favoured, on the 27th September, with an interview by his Excellency the Turkish Ambassador in London, at which his Excellency expressed himself pleased at the prospect of English interests being adequately represented in a scheme of such importance to his own country. Last week we received advices from Constantinople that the application for the Concession had been officially put forward, and that there was every prospect of an Irade being granted in its favour within a very short period provided certain moneys were lodged in trust for the eventual benefit of sundry persons who had been instrumental in furthering the applicant's interests. The time for action having arrived, we cabled in reply that one of the partners of. our firm would proceed to Constantinople this week or next, with full powers to negotiate on behalf of our firm. But before committing ourselves further, we were desirous of assuring ourselves personally that Her Majesty's Government were not opposed to the project in principle, even if they did not see their way at the present juncture to lend us their active moral assistance, and to that end our Mr. Gerald Walton Williams sought the honour of the interview, which you were so kind as to grant him. As you will have gathered from the printed Memorandum already alluded to, it has been estimated that the total cost of the undertaking would amount to somewhat over 10,000,000/., allowing for the construction and equipment of a railway of standard guage, capable of maintaining a mean speed of 40 miles per hour throughout, as well [1649 q—l]as for the necessary works to protect the harbours at each terminus and render them safe in all weathers for anchorage, with a 10 per cent, margin for contingencies. Erom other sources we are given to understand that the above estimate may be too low, and in order that an unduly sanguine view should not be adopted as a basis, we have assumed that for all practical purposes the flotation of the Company would involve the raising of a capital of something like 15,000,000/., not all at the same time, of course, but by successive issues of various types judiciously spread over the period of construction. Such a capital seems very great when looked at by itself, but it is not so large when compared with that of other undertakings of similar magnitude, and it is estimated that the railway with its branches, comprising over 1,000 miles of track, would, when completed, earn enough to yield a remunerative return upon such outlay, leaving out of the question the Turkish guarantee, to be conceded upon security of tithes in the provinces traversed, of 6 per cent, on a prescribed amount of capital per kilometre constructed. In support of the contention that the suggested capital would not be excessive, we may mention that in the case of the Smyrna and x Cassaba Railway (a much less important enterprise), the issue of 4 per cent, obligations has been sanctioned for the purpose of constructing the extensions to Afmm Kara Hissar, at the rate of 280,000 fr. per kilometre, which would be equivalent to an aggregate of over 19,000/. for the railroad now under discussion, inclusive of its proposed branches. But it must be understood that we ourselves, as stockbrokers, are incompetent to criticise or indorse the technical estimates of railway engineers, and that we cannot hold ourselves responsible for the cost of construction and probable traffic as estimated by experts who know the country. It is evident that, if the Concession is obtained, a regular, careful, and competent survey of the proposed line will have to be made on behalf of the purchasers of the Concession before final estimates can be drawn up, and a public Company be floated. To that end. we propose, assuming the Irade to be granted and subsequently confirmed by Imperial Pirman, to then form a Syndicate with a capital of about 150,000/., which Syndicate would acquire from the concessionnaire the right to purchase from him the Concession at a figure to be agreed upon, in consideration of refunding to him and his group the preliminary expenses so far incurred, supplying the caution money required by the Porte, and the funds necessary for the full survey and other disbursements preparatory to the formation of a public Company. In due time an appeal to the public would be necessary, and thereupon a Company would be formed to which the Syndicate Would transfer its rights and privileges in consideration of the reimbursement of its expenses and a profit commensurate with the risks incurred. It is naturally difficult to estimate the prospects of raising the capital required for an undertaking which is still in the period of incubation, but we entertain no doubt that, with the Concession in hand and the tacit approval of Her Majesty's Government, we should be able to secure the necessary financial support to carry the^ matter to a successful issue. It has been stipulated by Count Kapnist that there shall be reserved half the capital of the Company for issue in Russia, and half its representation on the Board of Directors for persons of Russian nationality. We may point out that the first of these stipulations does not imply that the Ilussian Government as such shall be entitled to claim a half or any share of proprietorship in the undertaking, but simply that one-half of the capital shall be offered for public subscription in the country. We should, furthermore, negotiate on the basis that Russian representation on the Board should be proportionate to the amount of capital subscribed in Russia, without in any case exceeding half the full strength of the Board. Although the proprietorship of the undertaking must, we understand, according to Turkish law, be nominally vested in an Ottoman Society, the undertaking would in reality belong to the English Company through possession of all the shares in the Ottoman Society. The above are the main features of the case as it at present stands outside of the scheme itself, with the details of which you are conversant, but we shall be very pleased to furnish you with any further information that you may desire to have, and that it may be in our power to communicate. Meanwhile, it is the intention of our Mr. Augustus Meyers, or, failing him, of our Mr. Gerald Walton Williams, to start on Sunday next for Constantinople, as promised, to assure himself of the substantial prospects held out of the early signature of an Irade in Count Kapnist's favour, and in such case to make such preliminary financial arrangements on behalf of our firm as he may consider justifiable under the circumstances. Needless to add that we shall only act on the assumption that Her Majesty's Government, having been apprised to the best of our ability with the main facts of theooot 3 situation, entertain no objection to the scheme in principle, and that, in the contrary event, we shall, upon your condescending to intimate to us that the scheme is officially' disapproved, immediately withdraw from the matter. J We take leave to assure you'of our paramount wish to act in entire consonance with the views of Her Majesty's Government, and you may rely upon our transmitting to you all essential information which it may interest you to receive as to the eventual progress of the negotiations. If you would permit our partner to give himself the honour of presenting himself to his Excellency the British Ambassador at Constantinople, he would there be in a position to supply more precise and more detailed particulars both of the project itself and of Count Kapnist/s prospects of success, after personal investigation on the spot and conference with the various parties concerned. 'We do not consider it within our privince to allude here to any political advantages which the scheme may possess from an English point of view, Her Majesty's Government being perfectly acquainted with the subject, but we may perhaps be allowed, in conclusion, to express our very humble opinion that, if Russian subjects were to obtain the Concession, it would be desirable that they should admit to an equal share of its benefits members of our own nationality rather than those of another Power. And there can be little doubt that, if the project is now dropped by the British interests, their abandoned opportunity will be eagerly seized by some financial group of another nationality,. anxious for political as well as for financial reasons to acquire increased influence in the country.

AUGUSTUS MEYERS, bringing- a letter of introduction from your Lordship, called upon me on the 6th instant. He informed me that his visit was in connection with Count Kapnist's Concession to construct a railway from Tripoli to Bagdad; that Count Kapnist was a mere figure head; that the capital would be provided by English capitalists; and that Count Kapnist had undertaken to make over his Concession, when obtained, to an Ottoman Limited Liability Company, whose shares would be held in London. At the same time-Mr. Meyers said that Russian capitalists would continue to be interested in the enterprise, and that it would have the support of the Russian Minister of Finance, M. Witte. His story was incoherent, and I could not make out that any security really existed against Count Kapnist refusing to allow himself to be set aside after the issue of the Sultan's Irade, which it was Mr. Meyers' object to obtain. I did not think there was any reason for giving him support in the matter—rather, indeed, the contrary; but I asked him to explain, if he could, the question more fully to Mr. Weakley, Commercial Attache to Her Majesty ? s Embassy. I believe he did so, but I have not yet heari from Mr. Weakley. Mr. Meyers talked of taking his Concession, once the Irade to prospect and study the project was issued, to Messrs. Rothchild, Messrs. Carrell, and other leading financiers, from whom he was pretty sure of support; but I confess I did. not like the whole affair, and that it seemed to me to bear out very much what I ventured to say to your Lordship in ray despath No. 525 of the 6th October, namely that it was apparently a project to engage British capital in an enterpri&amp;'e of very questionable financial profit while leaving to the Russians the possible political advantages to be derived from it.

I HAVE the honour to aeknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's despatch No. 227, Confidential, of the 3rd instant, inclosing copies of a correspondence respect ing an application which has been made by Count Kapnist for the concession of a X railway from Tripoli in Syria to the Persian Gulf, which is to be supported by the British firm of stockbrokers, Messrs. Williams, Meyer, and Co. In compliance with your Lordship's desire to be furnished with any remarks that I may have to offer on these papers, I would observe that it is difficult for me to pass any opinion on the advantage of this scheme. I received some weeks ago a visit from a M. Maimon who I understood to be the agent of the concessionnaire, and who had come to St. Petersburgh with the object of interesting the Russian Government in this undertaking, and was accompanied by Count Kapnist, whom I did not see. M. Maimon explained to me the origin of the application for Count Kapnist's concession, and Messrs. Williams' position towards it, and I was enabled by your Lordship's telegram, marked Commercial of the 30th September, to communicate to him, for his use if necessary, the assurance given by Mr. .L. de llothschild of the financial position of Messrs. Williams' firm. I have subsequently learnt that Count Kapnist, who has, as I understand, been put forward as ostensible concessionnaire on account of his nationality and name, is only very distantly connected with the Russian Ambassador at Vienna, that he has no private means of his own, or personal influence in this country, and that, although the Russian Poreign Office has made inquiries from the Russian Embassy at Constantinople respecting his concession, they have not evinced any disposition as yet to regard it as seriously meriting official support.

Extract from a Memorandum by Sir J. Ardagh on Count Kapnist s Scheme for a Railway between Mediterranean and Persian Gulf Tripoli to Koiveit. ( SL0 COIJNT KAPNIST appears to be a promoter, who hopes, by the intermediation of certain corrupt officials at Constantinople, for whose eventual benefit a sum of monev is to bo lodged in trust, to obtain a Concession for the construction of railways from the Mediterranean through the Euphrates and Tigris basms to the 1 ersian Gulf. Williams, Meyer, and Co., are stockbrokers who propose to work tao Concession. The proposals, as set forth in the Petition to the Sultan are extremely vague and it may be inferred that neither party knows, or wants to Know, anythmg about Jie details of the project. They are only concerned m making a piofit by floatm, a COml Suniifi' armain line to pass from Tripoli by Horns, Miaden, Baghdad, Nasriveh, Balra to Koweit, its length would be about 1,100 miles. Ihe branches mentioned would add about 1,400 miles; making a total of mles, or 4,000 kilom. The gauge of the line is stated to be ' broad,' t.e., presumably 4 ft. 8^ m. oi 5 feet, and it is to admit of a speed of 60 kilom. (37J miles) an hour, which implies heavy rails, easy gradients, and careful laying and maintenance, on aoout the scale of oui The average capital outlay per mile open of the 15,000 miles of » ft. Cm. standard guage lines in India is 158,000 rupees. Converting this at the rate o,. 11- l rupees (a great deal of the capital having been raised when rupees were woi'th -s. o . l more) .he panital outlav per mile comes to aBout 13,000/. ^ _ __ Lines recently constructed have cost much less—the 860 miles of tlie Bengai- Na^pur ; the 680 miles of Indian midland; and the 830 miles of Oudh-Eoliilklmnci, cost about 10,000/. per mile; and the 160 miles Delhi-Umbali-Khalka, about 8,000/. When it is considered that the Sultan, the Porte, the intermediaries, the concessionnaire, the brokers, and the Syndicate, all expect commensurate pront before the constructing Company enters the field, it may be anticipated that the line now in question will not be made for less than 15,000/. per mile The main line alone oi: 1100 miles, would at this rate require a capital of 16,500,000/. The supplementary branches mentioned in the Concession, would only have the parent Company between them and the subscribing capitalists, and might perhaps be moxle for 8,000;. per mi e. At this rate the 1,400 miles'of branches might be constructed ior j-,.,20J,0^Ci'., making a total of 27,700,000/. of capital for railways alone. To this must be added the cost of the two ports at Inpoli and Km\eit, and presumably another at Alexandretta ; the reclamation drainage and irngatioii of the lands in the basins of the Euphrates and Tigris; the works needed tor the regularization and navigation of these rivers ; the exploitation of tlie mines and petroieam deposits in a belt 100 kilom. (62-5 miles) in width along the railway, which, collectrvely, would amount to a further sum of at least 3,000,000/., making a grand total of at least 30 000 000/., over which the parent Company would have control, in is is the amount of' the' outstanding portion of the war indemnity due by lurkey to Ivussia; and [1726 r/-l]between one-Iialf and one-fifth of the new capital annually created in the world, the enterprise may, therefore, be fairly described by Count Kapnist as ' Foeuvre la plus grandiose de ce si^cle.' The project of the Petition addressed to the Sultan virtually comprises the exclusive right of exploitation of the basins of the Euphrates and Tigris, ports, railways, river navigation, mines, and all land capable of being reclaimed, the holders of such a Concession would undoubtedly have a predominant influence in the country. As half the capital is to be issued in Hussia, and half the Directors are to bo persons of Russian nationality, the other halves being distributed over the rest of the world, it is obvious that if such terms are accepted, the preponderance of the uniform moiety of capital and direction over the distributed moiety, is amply provided for, and that the undertaking would be essentially a Russian monopoly/ The scheme in this form, appears, therefore, to be one which cannot be commended as a patriotic invest ment for British capital, or as one which would be consonant with the general interests of this country. Nor is the basis upon which Messrs.Williams, Meyer, and Co. propose to negotiate, viz., that Russian representation should be proportionate to Russian capital without in any case exceeding half the whole, an adequate safeguard. Nothing short of an assured British majority on the Board of Directors should be considered sufficient to deserve the support of Her Majesty's Government. Prom the analogy of other instances of a like nature, it may be inferred that Count Kapnist's reservation was not intended to furnish a field of investment for the surplus capital of private persons in Russia; but rather to create an opportunity for the State financiers of that country to acquire predominant influence in the basins of the Euphrates and Tigris, with a view to their eventual inheritance. There is little surplus capital in Russia, and the ordinary Russian manifests no disposition to invest in &lt;e wild-cat schemes abroad, even when they conduce to the aggrandisement of his country. The Trans-Caspian, Siberian, and Manchurian Railways; the Russo-Chinese Bank ; and the Tehran—Resht road, are all State concerns, and so would be the Mesopotamian undertaking, if worked on Count Kapnist's lines, which appear to be favoured by the Russian Embassy at Constantinople. There is a certain grim humour in the conception of acquiring the reversion of the Euphrates and Tigris basins by means of a so-called International Joint-Stock Company largely supported by British capital, but directed by Russia; and from that point of view 30,000,000/. does not appear to be an inordinately great eventual liability ; for the expenditure of the sum would in any case be spread over a great many years, and the amount to be raised annually need not exceed 3,000,000Z. In connection with^ the Kapnist project, it may be well to call attention to other schemes which Russia is believed to have in contemplation, and to those of othei^ projectors. Persia is now* in a condition of unrest which occasions grave anxiety as to its future, and may precipitate a disruption for which even Prussia is hardly prepared. Events may^ force her hand, and compel her to garner the fruit before it becomes altogether ripe. In this event, she will presumably take possession or assume a protectorate over Azerbijan on the west, and a portion of Khorassan on the east. A railway through the former would connect with the Kapnist scheme at Khanikin; and that through the latter would lead from Ashkabad to Meshed, Birjand, and Seistan ; from whence there would be an easy route along the Helmand to Kandahar. The line from Merv in the direction of Herat is already commenced. Its progress beyond the Afghan frontier must await future events, but already suggestions have been thrown out as to the prospect of connecting with Kandahar and Quetta. These vast conceptions are at present mere castles in the air devised by the military adventurers who play such important parts in the development of Russian frontier policy. Underlying them are the aspirations for extending Russian power over Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan, for ports on the Persian G-ulf, and, for the invasion of India • to none oi; which we can afford to be indifferent, although they have not yet become burning questions.

Scott's No. 372 of the 17th November and Sir J. Ardagh's Memorandum of the 29th November on the subject of the 'Kapnist' scheme for a r^-Uway from Tripoli to Koweit, it may be of interest to record a rumour which has reached Mr. Weakley to the effect that M. de Witte, who had given his consent to the scheme (as, at least, Mr. Meyer stated), had subsequently been informed in Paris that English capital and interest would be predominant, and had, in consequence, withdrawn any support which he might have given it. The news of this change of front has, as Mr. Weakley hears, necessitated a reference to St. Petersburgh, and Russian support is not, as yet, assured to the enterprise. If British capitalists are anxious to invest in railways in Syria, it is strange that the Kapnist scheme should be preferred to that of Mr. Pilling, who has obtained a Concession for a railway from Haifa to Damascus via Tiberias, which line has, I believe, been surveyed, and presents, I am told, no great engineering difficulty. Mr. Pilling s line would tap the Hauran, the best grain-producing district in Syria, and Haifa is, without doubt, the best port of that province. The policy of the Porte appears to be to push the Anatolian Railway towards Mesopotamia, in order that communication with that part of the Empire should lead direct to Constantinople. The German line is bound by its contract, as soon as traffic receipts equal its guarantee, to extend itself towards Diarbekir, and it is not likely that any other line will be permitted to compete. Thus it is probable that if the Kapnist Company commenced operations at the two extremities of the projected route it would not be allowed to complete the connection from sea to sea, with the result that, far from creating a shorter route to India, the Company would end by building a line from the Persian Gulf northwards, which Russia would utilize when the line through Western Persia is completed. I have referred to only a few of the many reasons which seem to me to make it UiiUesirable for the Foreign Office to give any kind of support to Mr. Meyer and his associates in the Kapnist scheme.

REFERRING to the conversation wliicli our Mr. Meyers had the honour to have with you yesterday, we are pleased to forward you Mr. Pears' letter re Trade*, am, should feel obliged if you would kindly return it to us after having placed it before Lord Salisbury for perusal. With regard to the point touched by you as to whether, in the event of his . Concession being obtained, our contract with Count Kapnist-would be found to be sufficiently binding to safeguard us against any attempt that might be made to transfer the Concession to other parties not approved of by Her Majesty's Govern ment or ourselves, we take the liberty to quote from a confidential Report handed to us a few ago, on his return from Constantinople, by a gentleman in our office, who had been watching our interests out there. He says :— ' Mr. Pears sent word to us asking how matters were progressing, and on our paying him a visit, he informed us that Sir Nicholas O'Conor had called on him soon after Mr. Meyers' departure to make inquiries about our matter, and that since he had twice sent Mr. Weakley, the Embassy's Commercial Attache, on the same mission. Pears told us that Sir Nicholas was particularly concerned to know whether, in the case of this Concession being granted by the Sultan to Count Kapnist, our contract with the latter was binding enough to prevent him from transferring the Concession to any body not suitable to us. We meant to set his Excellency's mind at rest on that point, and, after an interview with Count Kapnist, got him to write a letter to E. Rechnitzer, declaring himself to be acting in this matter merely as E. Rechnitzer's and his financial group's agent, and binding himself to have E. Rechnitzer's name inserted in the Convention, besides his own, as part concessionnaire. This letter was .signed by Count Kapnist at Mr. Pears' office, in the latter's presence, and officially acknowledged receipt of by E. Rechnitzer in a return letter to the Count. Further- mo^r Count Kapnist was made to write a letter to Mahmoud Djellalledin Pasha, the Minister of Public Works, after the latter had been communicated with, practically repeating what had been stated in the Count's letter to E. Rechnitzer, and duly testified copies of these letters having been prepared by Mr. Pears, they were taken up to the Embassy and handed to Sir Nicholas O'Conor/' We may add that we have known Mr. Rechnitzer for a long time, and that he is the gentleman who orignially brought this Concession business to us.

Williams, Meyers, and Company to the foreign Off ce, which contains some misstatements which it may he as well to correct at once. They are made, I believe, by a Mr. Hahn, Clerk of Williams and Meyers, who is looking after their interests here. It is not true that I called on Mr. Pears to make inquiries as to the Kapnist negotiations, or that Mr. Weakley called on my behalf with similar purpose. It is also untrue that testified or in fact any copies of letters from Count Kapnist to the Minister of Public Works and M. Kechnitzer were taken to the Embassy and handed to me. These misstatements are important, as showing that the information given to the Foreign Office by Messrs. Williams, Meyers, and Company is not reliable. I would at the same time draw particular attention to the statement that Count Kapnist remains ' part concessionnaire ' with M. Eechnitzer, and that this will give him at any time the opportunity of making difficulties for the Company should their action not be in conformity either with his own views, or, what is still more important, with those of his Government. I have little to add to the remarks which I have already'made in regard to this concession in my despatches Nos. 525 and 585 of the 6th October and 8th November and in my letter to Sir T. Sanderson of the 22nd December, and I still consider that the scheme is one which British financiers of high standing should not be encouraged to support until they have arranged to eliminate Count Kapnist's name from the concession which they are seeking. I understand that Mr. Williams is shortly expected here in connection with this business, and that it is bruited abroad that he has the support of Messrs. Kothschild ancV'Companv.

It is stated in this Memorandum that Mr. Meyers has retired from the concern ; that the Company to which he belonged has been recast under the style of Messrs. Williams, de Broe, and Co.; that a powerful Syndicate, enjoying the support of Messrs.

Count Kapnist is to be induced to sell his interest in the line. M. Eechnitzer, an Austrian subject, represents the firm at Constantinople, and the project is under examination in the Turkish Ministry of Public Works. I have expressed my views fully on the subject of this scheme in my above- mentioned despatch and in my previous reports. The withdrawal of the Russian element puts a somewhat different complexion upon it, but the information at my disposal is not yet sufficiently complete to enable me to form a final judgment.

The new firm, under the style of Messrs.

Messrs. Matheson and Co. Messrs. Hosenthal and Co. Messrs, S. Neumann and Co. Messrs. A. G. Schiff and Co.

Reclmitzer and the Sublime Porte for the grant of a Concession for a railroad from the Syrian coast to the Persian Gnlf, I learn from the Austrian Ambassador that M. Rechnitzer, who appears to be a Concession hunter by profession, has applied to him for official support on the strength of a recommendation from the Austrian Eoreign Office, and that His Excellency has offered to give him a letter to the. Porte, stating that he is recommended by his Government and is backed by a strong financial Syndicate. The inclosed Memorandum gives an account of an interview which Mr. Weakley has had with M. Rechnitzer. The Memorandum contains some interesting details of the course of the negotiations during the period when the Concession was sought in Count Kapnist's name. That gentleman has now informed the Porte that he has ceased to have any interest in the scheme, and has declared M. Rechnitzer to be the real applicant for the Concession. M. Rechnitzer's proposals have been carefully examined at the Ministry ^of Public Works, where certain modifications were agreed to, and the scheme, as amended, is now under consideration at the Palace. It embraces the cons truction of a line from Alexandretta to some point not yet determined on the Persian Gulf, passing through Aleppo, Deir, Bagdad, and Basrah, and a branch line from Bagdad to Nedjef Tesherif via Kerbela. M. Rechnitzer is informed that the Sultan is disposed to grant the desired Concession on condition that the scheme is made to include the construction of a line connecting the new railway with the Anatolian system, running from Koniah to some point between Alexandria and Aleppo, whereby through connection would be established with Constantinople. I have, &amp;c., (Sd.) N. R. O'CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Weakley. (Confidential.) In continuation of my Memorandum of the 18th instant, I have to report that I have seen M. Rechnitzer, from whom I have obtained the following particulars regarding Count Kapnist's railway scheme. 12 The communication addressed to the Porte by Count Kapnist, intimating his having ceased to have any further interest in the Tripoli-Koweit Railway scheme, and declaring M. Kechnitzer to be the real applicant for the Con cession, has now been handed in. The project is now, therefore, in the hands of 1V1. Rechnitzer, who is carrying on the negotiations with the Porte on behalf of the financial Syndicate mentioned in my previous Memorandum on the subject. M. Rechnitzer explained that the scheme was first brought forward under Count Kapnist's name, with a view to prevent Russian opposition, and with the idea of obtaining powerful influence, both in St. Petersburgh and in Cons tantinople, for the furtherance of the project. With this end in view, Count Kapnist had been successful in obtaining the support of Count Mouravieff and M. de 'Witte, on the condition that a portion of the capital necessary for the construction of the line was to be rais^A on the Russian market. The scheme was, however, from the outset very strongly opposed by Prince Oukhtomsky, and M. Tatischeff, Financial Adviser to the Russian Embassy in London, considered that Russian support should only be given to Count Kapnist in the event of the project he was interested in being entirely placed under Russian control. M. Tatischeff: was even of the opinion that, under such circumstances, the Russian Government scheme of extending the Central Asia Railway into Afghanistan might be abandoned. In the course of subsequent negotiations, MM. de Witte and Romanoff stipulated that a small share capital of 10,000,000 fr. should be raised, of which 6,000,000 fr. was to be held in Russia, and that a debenture capital of 250,000,000 fr. should be obtained in England. These conditions could not be accepted by the London Syndicate, as they would place the line entirely under Russian control, and further negotiations being impossible, it was considered undesirable that Count Kapnist should, under the circumstances, continue to take an active part in the matter, and that he should give up his interest for a substantial consideration. The terms of the draft Convention have been carefully examined at the Ministry of Public Works, and certain modifications have been agreed to. The head of the line will be at Alexandretta instead of at Tripoli; the^ line will pass close to Aleppo on to Deir, and, following the right bank of the Euphrates, will reach Bagdad and Basrah, and will finally bring up at a point to be determined upon later on on the Persian Gulf, situated between Eao and Koweit, if not Koweit itself. M. Rechnitzer said there seemed to be some doubt as to the sovereignty of Turkey over Koweit, a doubt which had been expressed by Lord Curzon at an interview which M. Rechnitzer had had with him; it had, in consequence, been considered advisable to leave the terminus of the line on the Persian Gulf undetermined for the present, The proposal for the construction of a branch line from Bagdad to Hannekin has not been entertained by the Porte, as that line will form part of the Anatolian Railway Company's scheme, which joins Hannekin to Moussoul by way of Kifri. On the other hand, no objection was made to a branch being extended from Bagdad to Nedjef Tesherif via Kerbela. M. Rechnitzer has been informed that His Majesty the Sultan is favour ably disposed to grant him the Concession he has applied for on condition that his scheme includes the building of 450 kilom. of railway from Koniah via Adana to join the proposed line from Alexandretta at a point between that port and Aleppo, in order to have a through connection with Constantinople over the Anatolian system, which has Koniah as a terminus. Osman Bey, Sous-Chef de I'^Btat-Major, has received instructions from the Palace to examine M. Rechnitzer's proposals, and His Excellency Tahsin Bey, Eirst Secretary of the Palace, has been instructed to prepare a speqial report on the subject for Bis Majesty the Sultan's perusal,The modified project for the Concession of the railway applied for by M.
