Above, a farmer plows; below, a seated young man watches a produce seller weigh his purchase. On the rocks in the center foreground is inscribed the name of one of the most famous painters in Iran in the 11th century AH/AD 17th, Riza 'Abbasi (active 1001-1044 AH/AD 1591-1592 to 1634). As the handwriting does not match that of the artist, an admirer of Riza's work seems to have attributed the drawing to him. The execution and the bucolic subject matter of this drawing relate closely to the oeuvre of the Persian artist Muhammadi Haravi (active late 10th century AH/AD 16th), who worked in Qazvin. It is possible that this composition was conceived as a manuscript page.", "CreditLine": "Museum purchase, 1952", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/9136", "Keywords": "Islamic; Persian; Safavid; Illustration; Miniature; Drawing; Iran", "Provenance": "Kelekian Estate, 1952, by bequest; Walters Art Museum, 1952, by purchase.", "Dynasty": "Safavid Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Style of Attributed to Riza 'Abbasi (Persian, ca. 1565-1635)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.749_Fnt_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.749_Fnt_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.749_Fnt_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.749_Fnt_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.749_Fnt_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1507790, 1507949", "ExhibIDs": "709", "Images": "CPS_W.749_Back_DD.jpg, CPS_W.749_Fnt_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
