Memorandum by Sir West Ridgeway. 1. It is not our fault that the Hashtadan dispute has not been settled. Mr. Merk was deputed by Sir P. Lumsden in April 1885 to inquire into the dispute, and the Persian and Afghan Governments were asked to send officers to meet him. I he Afghans complied, hut the Persians did not. Accordingly the inquiry fell through. 2. ^The next step was to advise the Persian Government to settle the matter direct with the Amir, but nothing, I believe, has been done in that direction. 3. I have pointed out in my Despatch No. 45 of 24th May 1885 the great desirability of settling the whole Perso-Afghan frontier. Nearly all its length is at present uncultivated and unoccupied, but some settlement^ will spring up and a definition will be a very difficult matter. My survey officers fixed trigonometrically the necessary points, so Colonel MacLean with a native surveyor could easily do all that is necessary. 4. Nevertheless, I do not think the present time opportune for deciding the question. Certainly the Russo-Afghan frontier, as far as the Oxus, should first be disposed of. When that is done, I would have a loeal inquiry made as regards the Perso-Afghan frontier, but if the Amir remains as unreasonable and impracticable as he is at present, I would not announce the decision— unless it is highly favourable to Afghanistan—until the Amir’s death. But I would have the decision ready, and announce it to the next Amir on his accession. 5. Malcom Khan’s proposal seems to me very impracticable. The approxi mate frontier from Zulficar to Chah Zagak is sufficiently known and marked in our maps. It is the details that have to be settled, and in order to enable this to be done a local inquiry and a detailed map are necessary. W. R. 23rd February 1887.
