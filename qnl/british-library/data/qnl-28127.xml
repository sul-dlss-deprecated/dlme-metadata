MELF. I.—Persia 1. In dealing with the question of the Russian claim for participation in the oil of North Persia, the Majlis in secret session passed a single article Bill which, while recognising the premier's efforts to cope with Russian demands, decided that the official exchange of notes confirming the promises made in Moscow should be officially declared to fall under the law of the 11th Azar, 1323 (4th April, 1946), now known as the “ Mussadegh Law.' from the name of its introducer. This law declares all negotiations with any foreign Power, in connexion with Persian natural resources, to be illegal and punishable as a crime unless previously submitted to the Majlis and carried out with its full cognisance. The Majlis met subsequently and confirmed, by an overwhelming majority, the decision taken at the secret session. 2. It is reported that the Russians have obeyed the Persian Government’s request to withdraw the war-time created transport organisation of the Russian Government known as “ Iransovtrans.' It is now selling off its very badly broken-down fleet of transport vehicles, though showing a singular unwillingness to part with any of its buildings or installations up and down the country, and it is suggested that these might be taken over by the Soviet Govern ment trading organisation, Torgpret. Russian co-operation has not gone the length of returning to Persia her much desired gold lodged with the Russian National Bank, nor have the Russians paid a single cent of their debt to the Persian Government for customs duties owed by them. 3. At fhe end of the month, the committee which had been studying the activities of foreign traders in Persia produced its report and its suggestion for a draft Bill of fourteen articles. Some of the suggested articles completely contravene existing agreements with other countries, and others will be quite impossible to implement in their new form. One article, on the Tur kish model, gives a commission, sitting on behalf of the Ministry of National Economy, power to reserve to Persians many of the Liberal arts and crafts. 4. Whilst some reports state that the waters of the Helmand River are now flowing freely from Afghanistan into the province of Seistan, there is still no news of a permanent settlement of this question between the two countries concerned, Afghanistan and Persia. 5. Consequent upon extreme pressure from both political parties, the Government has been forced to give effect to the month- old recommendation towards balancing its economy. The commission which has been sitting for some time to consider retrench ment has at last made its report. Strict orders have been given to all departments to dispense with surplus personnel : no directors-general are to be appointed or continue in their present employment and no new employees are to be engaged without special permission from the Cabinet. 6. Autumn planting of crops are well in hand and are reported to be up to and even exceeding normal schedules. Unfortunately the Soviet is proving a stealthy but per sistent buyer for Persian farm and dairy produce, and the quantities involved are sufficient to cause some anxiety. Rice, for example, has reached (for first quality) the phenomenal price of rials 24*50 per kilo, owing to heavy Russian buying in the great rice-producing districts of the north. Nothing has come as yet of the efforts of the Indian Ministry of Food to purchase their 50,000 tons of grain from the Persian Government. One demand of the latter was for U.S. $120 per ton for Persian barley f.o.b. a Persian port, with 10 per cent, tolerance allowance. Then there was a demand for a supply of barter goods. The Indian official, realising the hopelessness of his task, has left the country. 13124-470 34590-132 There is little change in commodity prices of food-stuffs. 7. The demand for ready money has remained pressing and unceasing through out October, and has been consequently difficult to obtain. 1 At the close of October the price of fine gold was slightly higher than that quoted on 30th September—rials 440-445 per misghal as compared with rials 445-450 on 30th October. The rise was caused by persistent smuggling to India during the first three weeks of October; all kinds of gold was smuggled, even broken golden jewellery. In the last week of October, however, a tightening up on the frontiers owing to the cholera scare made smuggling more difficult, and hardly worth while. The National Bank of Iran, on 11th October, suspended sales of gold pahlevis, and did not sell for the rest of the month. George V sovereigns fell in the local market to the price of rials 930 each, which is a comparatively low figure when one remembers the heights touched during the smuggling period early in the month. Bills, drawn locally, have not been paid as promptly as usual, but foreign bills drawn in cover of shipment of goods from abroad have been met fairly quickly, as importers are now fearful of leaving goods in the cus toms for any undue length of time. No im portant changes have taken place during the month in regard to exchange control. 8. Engineers have been sent to the city of Tabriz to prepare the foundations for the new sugar refinery which is being erected there by the Central Government. Textile markets have coptinued dull throughout October. The prices, unlike the situation in September, have not been main tained and there has been a small but never theless very real reduction all round. Business was very poor with markets apparently well stocked. The bazaars are surprisingly well stocked with practically all commodities, including textiles. There is no doubt that hoarded stocks are being brought to light, and trade generally has been very quiet, even at this usually brisk season of the year. Prices are easier on a general basis and with some ex ceptions. Naturally the Government’s refusal to open credits for the period of almost four months has had its effect upon trade generally, and the last recent announcement of an increase in the budget for the sale of foreign exchange, to cover imports from abroad has not really helped in any great measure. Exports have continued fairly steadily in most commodities, except carpets. There has been a falling-off, probably due to the excessive prices demanded by Persian ex porters. Part of the Government-owned stock of 50 tons of opium having been sold to Spain, the Persians seem to imagine that they will have no difficulty in realising high prices for the balance. The Russians have been small sellers throughout the whole of the mont^of October, but they have bought heavily of every kind of food commodity. 9. The Minister of Roads and Communi cations announces that funds have been made available for the repair of the aero dromes at Abadan and Ahwaz, for the con struction of a bridge at Bander Shahpour port, for the asphaltage of the road between Khorramahahr and Ahwaz, and for exten sive repairs to the road from Ahwaz to Dizful and Shushtar. 10. The Postmaster-General announces that there will shortly be a direct air postal service between Turkey and Persia—the route being Tehran direct to Angora. 11. Early in the month of October the Ministry of National Economy found it necessary to increase the permitted expen diture on imports by 1,000 million rials, owing to marked shortages and increased market prices of certain commodities. 12. The Persian radio announced that measures to encourage home production of tea were to be taken in order to eliminate as soon as possible the need for importing it. By a ministerial decree, published on 12th October, it was demanded of importers of foreign tea that they should purchase 50 per cent, of the quantity imported from* abroad from locally grown stocks of tea, so that the importer of one ton of foreign tea is compelled to purchase half a ton of local tea as well. 13. The Ministry of Roads and Com munications officially announced commence ment of work on the following important Government enterprises :— (i) The road from Bander Abbas to Bander Lingeh—700 kilom. in length; (ii) The construction of a road from Kerman to Djirif; (iii) The construction of a road in Persian Baluchistan between Zahi- dan and Iranshahr; and (iv) The complete reparation of the route which is 259 kilom. in length, between Ear in Ears, and the port of Bander Abbas. 14. Bank deposits, 23rd September— Government: 1,950 million rials. Others : 8,425 million rials.3 Bank advances, 23rd September— Government: 4,056 million rials. Others : 2,063 million rials. Price of fine gold per misghal— 30th October : 445-450 rials. Gold sovereigns—George V : 930 rials. Jifee exchange market— Dollars = 71-71-25 rials per $. Sterling = 207-207-50 per £. II.—Iraq 1. It is generally considered, and the Prime Minister has stated, that owing to drought there has been a shortfall of 65,000 tons in this year’s wheat crop. This has combined with other factors to cause a shortage of wheat for domestic consump tion which has given the Government some anxiety, although substantial stocks of wheat are known to be hoarded in some liwas, and wheat is daily smuggled out of the country to Transjordan. The Government demand half the wheat crop at the price of ID.26 per ton, while the open market price, which about two months ago was about ID.40 per ton, has now risen to between ID.80-90 per ton. The Government’s reason for demanding half the crop is to ensure that adequate supplies will be available for the large towns, particularly Bagdad and Basra. They are also endeavouring to obtain an allocation of 30,000 tons of wheat from Australia, but it is not yet known whether the authority of the International Emergency Food Council will be necessary or will be obtained. At the same time a ban has been placed on all exports of barley, of which normally some 150,000 to 200,000 tons are exported annually. As a result of the ban on export, the price of barley has rapidly fallen from ID.35 per ton to ID.26 per ton. 2. In spite of many difficulties and the present ban on hard currency imports the value of credits opened for business abroad during October was more than double the highest figure this year and is the greatest yet recorded. Most of these credits are for cotton piece-goods and other goods which can be imported on open general licence. 3. It is reported that applications for import licences are going in to the Ministry at the rate of about 1.000 per day and are being dealt with at the rate of about twenty. The value of imports in March was ID.4,112,600, the highest yet recorded; exports were valued at ID.1,909,524. The comparative figures for February were ID.2,234,340 and ID.775,030. 4. The Iraq Government issued a new 3 per cent, loan on 1st October. The issue was of ID.l million in 10,000 bonds of ID.100 each, and preference in the sale of bonds was given to holders of the Iraq 3 per cent, loan of 1944 (which matures on 31st December, 1947), who wished to exchange their bonds. Sales against redemption of the 1944 loan bonds did not amount to more than about ID.350,000. The rate of interest offered and the lack of provision for hard currency exchange tended to make this loan less popular than previous loans. 5. A general census of Iraq was made on 19th October. The total population is 4,794,449. 6 . w. Government revenue for February 1947 1,247,545 Government expendit 1947 ure for February 1,720,415 Bank deposits— Aug. 1947 ID. Sept. 1947 ID.

An international trade fair was held in Izmir, opening on 20th August, to last till 20th September. Bulgaria, Czecho slovakia, Greece, Iran, Pakistan, Poland and Yugoslavia had official pavilions. Other countries were represented by private stands. 2. Further particulars of the “ Ameri can Aid to Turkey ” agreement are now available and show that the $100 million will be classified as military, so that the sum will, in fact, constitute a gift, and may, moreover, be increased by 25 per cent. It will be allotted as follows : 50 per cent to the army, 30 per cent, to the air force, 10 per cent, to the navy, and 10 per cent, to miscellaneous which includes $5 million for roads. 3. The coming tobacco harvest is expected to exceed 90,000 tons, about the same as last year. The Government proposes to set up five new tobacco curing stations, to cost £T.5 million (£443,000) each, over the next five years. This is part of the Government’s plan to improve the quality of Turkish tobacco and encourage its export. b 2 34590-134. The overall cereals production should be from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, below last year’s, which makes it doubtful whether there will be any exportable sur plus. It is expected that some 300,000 tons of this year’s crop will be placed in the reserve. The silk harvest, which ended in July, was about 25 per cent, below last year. 5. New silver Turkish lira coins, weigh ing 71 gr. each, were put into circulation in August. A group of business men have decided to found a new bank, the Banque de Credit de Turquie, with a capital of TL. 2 million (£176,000). 6. The note circulation remained prac tically unchanged during July and August, compared with decreases of TL. 20-8 mil lion in June and TL. 24-2 million in May. The circulation is made up as under:— 30th August, 98th June, 1947 1947 £T. £T. Old issue 117,607,000 116,850,000 Supplementarv issue (covered by gold) 369,233,000 324,230,000 Supplementary issue (covered by bills) 454,390,000 500,540,000 941,230,000 941,620,000 Gold reserve 484,467,000 531,763,000 (£43 million) (£47-1 million) The gold reserve decreased by 15,011-1 kilog. in July and August, following a re duction of 14,206-2 kilog. in June and 15,623-3 kilog. in May. These reductions are due partly to Turkey’s contribution to the International Monetary Fund and partly to the conversion of gold to meet foreign exchange, principally I nited States dollar commitments. Gold and foreign exchange reserves amounted to £61 - 5 million on 30th August, as against £64-2 million on 28th June. During the first eight months of 1947 the Central Bank’s gold reserves have been reduced by close on 56,000 kilog., or TL. 186 million. As against this, however, holdings in foreign currency (principally sterling) have increased by about TL. 130 million. The published provisional returns of the Treasury for the 1946 budget are :— £T.million Actual receipts ... ... ... ••• 956-7 (£T.62 million above estimates) Deficit covered by loans ... ... 95-9 Total 1,052-6 Estimated expenditure ... ... ... 990-6 Additional credits authorised 93-3 1,083-9 Deficit ... ... ••• ••• ••• 31-3 Owing to certain Government budgetary accounting rules, the expenditure has pro bably not exceeded TL. 1,055-8 million. The income from the internal loans floated in 1946 will in all probability suffice to cover the deficit. The total allocation to national deface in 1946 was TL. 369 -9 million, a^ut 39 per cent, of total budget expenditure. 7. The shortage of money continued during July and August, due to heavy arrivals of imports, cotton piece-goods in particular, which had not been cleared from customs. There were signs in August of increased buying activity on the home market. One thousand tons of cement were said to have been bought in Beirut by the Turkish Ministry of Economy. The short age is estimated at about 100,000 tons. In July some 4,000 cases (10 gross) of first- quality eggs were sold, at £12 f.o.b., to Greece and Palestine, and in August 3,500 at from £11 to £13, according to quality, to Cechoslovakia, Palestine, Greece and Switzerland. The Ministry of Commerce in July authorised the export of 60,000 pairs of locally-manufactured silk stock ings and 50,000 metres of natural silk cloth. 8. Wholesale prices of local industrial products have remained stable, while prices of certain imports have tended to fall, a number of importers having had to sell their stocks without profit owing to the financial stringency. Export prices showed a weaker tendency. 9. Arrangements were made to enable Turkish business men to visit the Hanover Trade Fair, and probably ten to twenty persons actually went. 10. For the first six months of 1947 the coal output from Zonguldak totalled 2,022,118 tons, compared with 1,972,654 tons for the first six months of 1946. An annual attendance premium is to be paid each July to encourage attendance of miners. 11. The Director-General of the Mineral Research Department returned from a visit to the United States where he ordered boring equipment. One boring machine, costing |800,000, was to be delivered in three months at Adana. 12. The congestion at the port of Istan bul continued, and in early August the Minister of Communications announced that as there were 120,000 tons of goods in the warehouses and no space available for further arrivals of cargo, storage rates would be increased to force merchants to withdraw their merchandise. No increase has yet been enforced. 13. On 23rd July an air convention was signed by the Turkish and Greek Govern-5 iry ro- )n. ,ed to ice /at Led yy in 3m of me 3re die rt- In st- to iOO tv, nd rce 100 3k- th. ial ces , a j ;ell ^he r ed ble fer ity :he led &gt;54 \.n lid of ral Lsit red ne, in an- the ced ; in for ites to ase -i « V ' »vas irn- ments granting reciprocal facilities to the Turkish and Greek airlines operating in the two territories. 14.

On 25th October the Socony Vacuum Oil Company and the Shell Company, who between them supply almost the whole of the fuel oils for Syria and the Lebanon, in formed the local Governments jointly that, owing to the world shortage of tankers, pipe lines and refining plant, the normal increases required by the two States for 1948 could not be supplied; furthermore, the Ameri- ean company would be unable to continue supplying at the present rate for the remainder of 1947; the companies had, how ever, agreed to pool their stocks and place them at the disposal of the two Govern ments so that the best possible distribution of the fuel oil available could be made by the two Governments. While the cut in petrol is unlikely to have any serious reper cussions, the reduction in the quantity of gas oil will seriously affect the suppliers of electricity and the users of gas-oil engines for spinning, weaving, olive pressing and pumping. It is certain that the Syrian Government will try to obtain fuel oils from Russian sources. 2. It is reported that the Syrian Govern ment are contemplating the purchase of hospital equipment to the value of between £S. 500,000 and £S. 1 million. 3.

During the month the bread rationing system threatened to break down on account of shortage of supplies. Demonstrations occurred in several provincial centres, and a meeting was held between representatives of the Lebanese and Syrian Governments on 17th October, as a result of which Syria agreed to lend 3,000 tons of wheat and 2,000 tons of barley in order to maintain minimum necessary supplies. In addition, the Government succeeded in requisitioning approximately 3,000 tons of cereals in the hands of private dealers. There was, how ever, widespread press criticism of the Government, and in order to allay public apprehension the Minister of National Economy issued an official statement on 23rd October to the effect that supplies (in stock or from orders) were assured until the end of February. 2. Negotiations were continued in Paris between representatives of the French, Lebanese and Syrian Governments on the question of the future of the local currency, the backing for which is at present guaran teed in francs by the French Treasury. No official statement has been issued, but unofficial reports all state that no agree ment has been reached due to French insis tence on payment of £S. 200 million as a contribution to the upkeep of local levies during the war. Meanwhile, the termina tion of the allocations of hard currency formerly made by the French to Lebanon and Syria, and the fear that any devalua tion of the franc will inevitably involve the local currency, have induced a noticeable lack of confidence in the local money market. 3. On 16th October the Minister of Finance discussed the present financial situation at a press conference. He stated that the Government’s holdings of hard currencies were virtually exhausted (al though, in fact, the Government hold approximately £600,000), and that actual expenditure during the current financial year had exceeded the budgetary estimate by £L. 18 million. In addition, the reserve fund of the Government, which had com prised £L. 20 million, was now reduced to £L. 10 million, chiefly due to expenditure by the Ministry of Public Works. Later official statements have prepared public opinion for a substantial budget deficit at the end of the financial year, and the6 Minister of Finance has added that if present food subsidies are to be maintained the public must face an increase in direct taxation or the imposition of indirect taxa tion from new sources. 4. The shortage of hard currencies, the lack of reassuring information about the financial negotiations in Paris and the prospect of the budget deficit have all com bined to produce sharp reactions in the local markets. Free sterling (French account), the price of which had been fairly stable throughout the summer around 925 piastres to £1 (official rate 881), rose to 1,000 at the beginning of the month and closed at 1,060. Similarly the price of the gold sovereign increased from 4,215 piastres to 4,670. As the bulk of imports are now being financed by free market exchange, this has already produced an increase in the cost of living, the official index of which rose to 501, compared with 495 for the two previous months. 5. Agreement appears to have been reached in principle on the United States- Lebanese Commercial and Cultural Treaty. It is understood that the final approval of the draft by the State Department is now awaited. 6. Shell and Socony Vacuum Oil Com panies—see page 5, “ Syria,” paragraph 1. 7. Beirut .—Gold prices at 30th October, 1947 :— Sovereigns : £L. 46 -35 to 46 -45. Five Tola Bars : £L. 260 to 262. Y.—Palestine 1. The shortage of good seed is still the most serious limiting factor in agriculture. In the drought-stricken areas the Govern ment distribution of wheat and barley, designed to conserve supplies of seed, con tinued. In addition, the Department of Agriculture distributed 155 tons of selected wheat and barley seed to approved seed- farmers. 2. There are indications that the olive crop may be somewhat better than was anticipated. The quality of the oil pressed from mature berries is good. Oil presses are being worked at full speed in order to take advantage of the prevailing high price of olive oil (around £P.500 per ton). Some 9,000 tons of grapes were crushed for winemaking. Under the new import policy, imports of fresh and dried fruit have been considerably restricted. 3. The supply position of cattle is now extremely precarious, depending almost entirely on the continuation of Iraqi exports to Syria and Transjordan and re-export to Palestine. The Turkish Gov ernment have discontinued the export of cattle into Palestine. The import of sheep was negligible, since the Turkish Govern ment issued no permits for the export of sheep to Palestine. The demand for meat was met by the large number of goats^m- ported from Turkey, for which export licences are still readily granted. The supply position cannot, however, be con sidered satisfactory as long as the supply depends entirely on goats from a single source. Natural grazing is finished and the depleted village flocks and herds are being kept alive by hand-feeding pending the coming of the rains. 4. The total weight of fish landed during September was 405 tons, compared with 300 tons for August and 275 tons for July. The increase was mainly due to a record production of 240 tons of carp from fish ponds to meet the increased demand for fresh fish during the Jewish holidays. 5. The production of Palestine standard flour was maintained in October at the August and September level of approxi mately 12,000 tons. It was produced from a pure wheat flour from wheat milled to 90 per cent, extraction, no adulterants being available 6. 400 tons of cocoanut oil were distri buted during the month. The production of margarine was increased to 430 tons. Soap production had to be entirely sus pended, but with the arrival of adequate stocks of caustic soda a resumption of production will be made in November. 7. During October there was a further considerable rise in the price of most local cereal grains and roughages. The average increase in the wholsesale price of wheat was £P.63 to £P.73 per ton, and of barley GP.40 to £P.46 per ton. To some extent these increases are attributed to the absence of rain and the consequence continued demand for feeding-stuffs as well as to the considerable demand for grain to be used as seed. The more serious factor is the hoarding of grain by farmers, and by merchants in the large cities, on account of the uncertain political future. 8. The interest of the farming com munity in the adoption of soil-conserving agriculture has grown to such an extent that the field staff of the Department of Agri culture and the Public Committee for Soil Conservation are overwhelmed by demands for advice and assistance. Generally speaking the Public Committee prepares the plans and assists by providing heavy7 K machinery where required, and the Agri cultural officers lav out the work and super vise its execution in the field. Comprehen sive schemes have been completed on the lands of many Jewish settlements, and such measures as hill-terracing, land reclamation and contour ploughing are steadily gaining m^entum in the Arab villages. Pales tinian farmers are. anxious to extend the mechanisation of their operations and there is an immediate demand for 500 crawler tractors and 1,500 cultivation implements of various kinds. 9. The Citrus Board has effected the following further sales (in cases):— Grape- Shamonti fruit Valencias Total Czechoslovakia 265,000 20,000 15,000 300,000 Sweden ... 129,000 ... ... 129,000 Holland ... 200,000 ... ... 200,000 10. The commercial community displayed some anxiety towards the end of September and the beginning of October as the result of doubt concerning the course which future import policy might take. This was accen tuated by the decision to recall all out standing import licences for re-examina tion. The fear of severe cuts was, however, allayed somewhat with the progressive return of the confirmed import licences. Many merchants and importers continue to place firm orders and to press for early delivery of goods for which they hold import licences. As a result an increased level of imports may be anticipated during the next few months. On the other hand, prices, which during the period of acute anxiety showed an upward trend (such as prices of building materials which rose by 10-20 per cent., and of textiles and house hold goods which rose by 5—10 pei cent.), stabilised towards the end of the month. 11. Messrs. Lodzia textile, Compam (Limited), were the first in Palestine to place on the market some 50 gross of locally- produced nylon stockings made from im ported nylon yarn. The quality has yet to be proved, but the price at which they ai e being marketed is some 25 per cent, below that of the imported product. 12. The building contractors have created a special purchasing organisation which aims at centralised purchases and at rendering contractors independent of im porters and merchants. Messrs. Magen, Chatwood (Limited), are completing the erection of their new works near Petah Tiqva, in which they expect to start produc tion at the beginning of 1948. It will con stitute the largest and most modern metal works in the country, producing safes, car and bus bodies and metal furniture, with equipment of United Kingdom and Lnited States origin. The capital is £P. 150,000, of which £P. 120,000 is paid up. 13. The figures of diamond exports to the United States show a gratifying increase (made possible by improved marketing con ditions there) although they still fall short of the 1946 figures. However, it would seem that unless import of roughs become subject to restrictions, continued develop ment may be expected. The Palestine industry has, nevertheless, to face the com petition of Belgian exporters who appear to have more favourable exchange possibili ties, and also increased insurance rates, which naturally have an adverse effect on the competitive capacity of Palestine pro cessed diamonds. During October 1947, 6,201 carats valued at £P.189,548 were ex ported, of which the Lnited States took 5,932 carats valued at £P.175,810, and ^the remaining 269 carats valued at £P.13,/SS were exported to the sterling area. Sep tember exports were much less at 2,54b carats valued at £P.75,997. 14. The following motor vehicles were imported during September 1947 From United States — Taxis and passenger cars (high powered) 86 From United Kingdom — Taxis and passenger cars (small and medium powered) ... ••• ••• 14(3 From Continent — Taxis and passenger cars (small and medium powered) ... ••• ••• 52 15. The external trade for July 1947 was :— Imports: £P.7,590,090 (June 1947, £P.6,931,463) Exports: £P.1,941,231 (June 1947, £P.2,029,795) 16. The return of the General Jewish Labour Exchange for September 1947, showed a total of 8,364 applicants registered as unemployed or under employed compared with 9,606 in August and 6,927 in September 1946. According to the records of the exchange, September had, as in past years, a lower registration of applicants than August. . The Council for the Resettlement of Jewish Ex-Servicemen wound up its opera tions in October on completion of its func tions. During the twenty-one months of its existence the council assisted in the imple mentation of schemes for the reabsorption of some 15,000 Jewish ex-servicemen and women into civilian life.8 17. £P.

The weather in general was favour able though little rain fell, particularly in the plains; livestock in hill areas had crop residues to graze, but there had to be con siderable hand feeding on the plains. There was a slight improvement in the supply of agricultural field implements as many badly needed spares and some new ploughs, and also Diesel and other internal combustion engines and some small tools, were received. 2. Prices of agricultural products in general were satisfactory for producers. In fact prices of olives and olive oil, although production was normal, remained so high that supplies imported from Greece were being marketed at a lower price. 3. A thousand tons each of seed wheat and barley was distributed against pay ment from Government controlled stores, but as this did not satisfy demand it was decided to allow the sale, purchase and movement of cereals under permit to ensure that farmers obtained their full seed requirements. Indications are that the area to be sown with cereals will be normal. The autumn area under haricots is esti mated to be greater than usual and crop prospects are considered good, while the acreage under winter crop potatoes is reported to be higher than last year. Large quantities of onions of exportable quality remain unsold and the export demand is slow, but the demand for carobs has improved and prices have risen. 4. The condition of the citrus groves is fairly satisfactory and preparations for export are in hand and shipment is to be made to Scandinavia shortly. It is expected that there may be difficulty in meeting the increased demand for seed required for the increased acreage to be sown with linseed in the coming year. The production of yellow leaf tobacco is estimated at 300,000 okes, but demand is slow and price poor. The vine production has fallen by about 30 per cent, compared with last year, but quality is good and the vintage is now com pleted in all areas. YU.—Egypt 1. Anti-cholera restrictions of movement inside the country must have led to con siderable loss to the farmers, especially vegetable and date growers. As river trans port came to a standstill, much cotton remained up country. A number of ships in Alexandria harbour left either wit ut unloading or without taking on cargo. The fall in receipts by the Egyptian State Railways since restrictions were put on are said to be in the region of £E.2 million, plus the seasonal expectation of traffic during the Bairam holidays. Certain ships carrying chemical fertilisers, expected early in November, have not sailed for their destination. Should they not arrive, next season’s wheat crop may be adversely affected. 2. Average estimates for 1947 for rice, sesame and groundnuts recently issued by the Ministry of Agriculture all show increased areas, as follows :— Acreage in 1946 Acreage in 1947 Feddans Feddans Rice (Seiti and Xili) 631,602 773,046 Sesame ... ... 31,762 44,064 Groundnuts ... 23,725 25,351 The Ministry of Agriculture has further declared that the maize (sefi) crop shows an increase of 400,000 ardebs and the rice crop an increase of about 300,000 daribas over last year. The rice surplus figures since 1944 are given as follows :— Daribars 1944 150,000 1945 186,000 1946 220,000 1947 280,000 Negotiations are at present taking place with International Emergency Food Coun cil for the exchange of surplus rice for wheat. 3. A newspaper report states that the Ministry of Social Affairs has drafted a Bill for presentation to Parliament at the beginning of the next session, fixing a minimum wage for agricultural workers. 4. A new company, called the Egyptian Stevedoring and Shipping Company, S.A.E., has been formed with a capital of £E.20,000. The following are capital increases in existing companies :— From To Helwan Portland Cement £E. £E. Company, S.A.E. ... Soc. Misr pour ITndustrie et le Commerce des Huiles, 600,000 900,000 S.A.E Industrie Fibres Textiles, 30,000 75,000 S.A.E. 200,000 260,000 Industrie du Froid, S.A.E. ... 25,000 75,0009 Following on the quiet conditions of September, there was an almost complete calm on the local Stock Exchange during October. Very few important fluctuations in prices were recorded, quotations on the whole being firm. 5. ^he 1946-47 financial year is reported to hav^e closed with a surplus of approxi mately £E.10,301,000 instead of the antici pated deficit of £E.6,109,100. 'Phis has been credited to the General Reserve Fund. Of the surplus, £E.2,834,733 represented part of the sum set aside for the five-year plan but not, in fact, expended. Details of the items are as follows :— Estimated Realised £E. £E. Revenue 97,394,000 112,793,000 Expenditure ... 103,503,100 102,492,000 Deficit 6,109,100 Surplus 10,301,000 Customs and excise receipts for the period from 1st May to 5th November, 1947. totalled £E.28,008,096, an increase of £E.4,337,219 over the corresponding period of 1946. 6. Cotton exports are still moving slowly this season. According to official returns there have been no shipments to the United Kingdom since the season opened. Details of exports, as furnished by the Statistical Department of the Egyptian Government, are as follows :— compared with July-August. 1 his rise is to some extent due to the cholera epidemic, which disorganised communications and led to maldistribution of commodities. The price of imported goods also rose owing to the state of uncertainty with regard to possible unfavourable develop ments after 31st December, when the present sterling agreement comes to an end. This has led to a good deal of hoarding. (Note.— The cost-of-living graph of the Shell Company has since 1943 followed much the same line as that of the Egyptian Government, but the actual cost- of-living figures are lower, e.g., July- August, Shell Company average for five categories from £E.12 to £E.35 per month = 256 -8, while the Egyptian Government published figures for July-August are 276-9 and 279 -6.)

Details of cotton exports obtained by com mercial circles from ships’ manifests, &amp;c., show that from 1st September, 1947, to 31st October, 1947, a total of 133,098 bales were shipped, of which 15,535 bales to the United Kingdom. The Egyptian Government has autho rised a scheme for the export of 100,000 bales of cotton to European countries (ex cept Switzerland) for barter against goods. 7. The Shell Company cost-of-living report shows an upward tendency of prices resulting in an increase of 3-8 points in their index figures in September-October IX.—Persian Gulf The cholera epidemic in Egypt seriously affected communications. The Saudi Arabian Government forbade all inter course between the mainland and Bahrein because planes which land in Egypt and India call at Bahrein. The postal administration in the Gulf is now being conducted by officials of the Pakistan Government, who insist on the introduction of Indian stamps surcharged “ Pakistan.' Pakistan stamps have actually been brought into use at Dubar . and have arrived at Guradur. 2. The pearl-diving season has been poor and it is said that the Sheikh of Bahrein is much perturbed by the prohibition imposed by the Government of India on the import of pearls. The fall in price conse quent on this ban, as well as the poor quality of the finds, is causing distress and the Government have had to give some assistance to the pearl divers. 3. It was reported that the Government of India had imposed a total prohibition on the import of dates from Muscat. Such 13124-470 34590-13 c10 a ban would be most serious as the dates on the Batinah coast are prepared in a dry form and used almost exclusively for weddings and other ceremonies in India. No alternative market could be found for them, especially at short notice, and the prohibition would mean ruin for cultiva tors and heavy losses for the Indian mer chants who handle the fruit. Enquiries from the Government of India, after nearly two months' delay, elicited a reply that the import quota of these dates has been reduced by 50 per cent., but that there is no prohibition by country craft. 4. During the six weeks 16th September to 30th October, 90 ships (38 British, 19 American, 13 Norwegian, 4 Swedish, 5 Dutch, 5 Panamanian, 1 Italian, 1 Portu guese) called at the port of Bahrein. Imports included 5,410 tons of general cargo for Bahrein and 2,882 tons for tran shipment to the mainland. Exports were 6.788 tons of general cargo and 659,380 tons of petroleum products. 5. As a result of the increase in wages to employees of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, the seamen and motor transport drivers of the British Overseas Airways Corporation went on strike on the 1st, demanding an increase in wages. The strike ended on the 4th. 6. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) (Limited) have set up camp in Abu Dhabi territory and survey work was due to begin on 15th October. Mr. B. H. Lermitte, manager of Petroleum Conces sions (Limited), Bahrein, visited Sharjah for one day. X.—Cyrenaica Recent rains have been most welcome and the Bedouin have started ploughing and seeding. The Jebel has had by far the heaviest rainfall and hopes of a bumper spring crop are high. XL—(Tripolitania Raim has fallen in Tarhuna, Orfella, Misurata and Zlites districts. This has had the effect of causing the return to these rural areas of many families who had been driven by the drought to move to Tripoli and the larger towns. Ploughing has com menced in these areas. XII.—Somalia During the month of August there was only a trickle of trade, which is usual at this time of the year. Merchants are awaiting the arrival of the promised Japanese cotton piece-goods with a certain amount of anxiety. The question upper most in their minds is whether the rather expensive United States stuff now in their possession will be able to compete. Negotiations still continue for the dis posal of the surplus famine maize reserve. 2. The cost of living remained ^airly steady, but there was a slight increase in the selling price of cotton piece-goods due to the implementation of a direct sales policy. XIII. —British Somaliland The Karin rains in the Borama-Seileh district were not up to average this year, and it is feared that the crop yield will be below normal. Stock generally is in good condition. From a preliminary recon naissance of the coastal area from Zeila to Berbera it is reported that, if the water available is sufficient, dates might be grown in quantity on that coast. Investigations as to the type of date best suited to Somali land are being pursued. Somali merchants are making enquiries concerning direct trade with foreign merchants rather than through Aden middlemen. Many offers to trade direct have been received from Great Britain, United States and elsewhere, and the local merchants are now seeking advice about the finance of such trade. 2. Kat licences under the new ordinance have now been taken out in all districts. XIV. —Desert Locust Situation The campaign in the Sudan was con cluded and at the end of the month all districts were reported to be clear of locusts. In Eritrea a few hopper bands were reported from the Middle Anseba, Keren and Agerdat. but these were later controlled. Mature swarms were reported from Tigre, eastern Harar and the reserved areas of Ethiopia. Some escapes occurred in the reserved areas. 2. The general trend of swarms in British Somaliland was to the south. In Somalia mature and maturing swarms present in the Mijertein tended to move south. Swarms were also reported from northern Mudugh, south Ogaden and in the upper Juba province. 3. The East African colonies, India, Persia and the Arab countries remained clear. XV. —The New Company Law of Egypt The following is an English version of certain provisions relating to joint stock11 companies passed by the Egyptian Senate on 30th June, 1947, and approved by the Egyptian Chamber of Deputies on 2nd July, 1947, and promulgated as Law No. 138 of 1947 Article 1.—No one is permitted to com bine a salaried public post with member- si^ of the board of directors of any joint stock company, or to participate in found ing such a company or perform any work of an administrative or advisory nature in it, whether wdth or without remuneration. Any official contravening this prohibi tion shall be considered as having been dis charged from his post directly he accepts work with the company or continues to work in it after appointment to a Govern ment post. Nevertheless, the Council of Ministers shall have the power, as an exception to the provisions of this paragraph, to authorise officials whom it may choose to delegate to be members of the board of joint stock com panies in which the Government holds shares or has an interest. In such a case, the officials shall not receive any pay or remuneration either from the company or the Government, and whatsoever pay is due to them shall go to the Ministry of Finance. A rt. 2.—No Minister, before the lapse of three years from the date of leaving the Ministry or his post, and no official in the grade of Director-General or higher, shall have the right to work as manager, member of the board of directors, expert or adviser in any joint stock company to which the Government guarantees special advantages by way of subventions or guarantees, or which is bound to the Government by a con tract of monopoly, supplies, public works or a public utility concession. Anyone working in a joint stock com pany in contravention of the provision laid down by this article shall be punished by a fine of not less than £E.200 and not exceed ing £E.500 per contravention, as well as having to restitute all amounts received by him as fees to the Ministry of Finance. Each member of the board of directors who has taken part in the approval thereof shall also be required to pay the same fine for each contravention. A rt. 3.—No one, in his personal capacity or as representative of some other party, shall be allowed to be a member of the board of directors of more than ten joint stock companies, or to be managing director of more than two companies at the same time. This prohibition applies also to the chairman if he actually manages the company himself. This shall come into force after the expiry of the financial year in the course of which this law is promulgated. Anyone contravening this prohibition shall render invalid his directorship on the boards which are in excess of the maximum number allowed by law. He shall also be punished by a fine equivalent to the amounts received by him as fees for his director ships on the boards which are in excess, as well as being obliged to restitute all amounts received by him from the com panies referred to. Art. 4.—At least 40 per cent, of the directors of the board of any joint stock company shall be Egyptian, failing which, all decisions of the company shall be null and void, and a fine not exceeding £E.2,000 may be inflicted on the company. The Council of Ministers, however, shall have the power to waive this provision in the case of companies whose activities are mostly abroad, or are particularly con cerned with financial transactions in firms most of which are abroad. Art. 5.—The number of Egyptians em ployed by a joint stock company shall not be less than 75 per cent, of the total number of its employees, and their total salaries and allowances shall not be less than 65 per cent, of the total amount of salaries and allowances paid by the company. The word “ employee ” means every person performing administrative, tech nical, clerical or accounting work, and who receives pay or allowances for his work from the company. The number of Egyptian workmen shall not be less than 90 per cent, of the total number of workmen, and their total wages shall not be less than 80 per cent, of the total amount of wages paid by the company. These percentages as prescribed above must be attained within a period of three years from the date on which this law comes into force, in such a manner that a per centage increase shall be made each year of one-third of the figure by which companies fall short in the number of Egyptians they employ until the prescribed percentages of employees and workmen are reached. The Minister of Commerce and Industry shall have the power to authorise the em ployment, for a period to be fixed by him. of technical managers and expert advisers of foreign nationality in cases where it proves impossible to find suitable Egyn- c 2 34590-1312 tians. Such technicians shall not be in cluded in the calculations of the above percentages. These provisions shall apply to branches, agencies and ofhces in Egypt of joint stock companies established abroad. The managing director or the responsible manager of the company or the manager of the branch, agency or office of a company registered abroad shall be punished by a fine not exceeding £E. 100 in all cases in which contravention of this article is proved. The fine will, however, be waived if it is proved that contravention was due to circumstances beyond his control. Art. 6.—At least 51 per cent, of the shares of joint stock companies shall be ear marked for Egyptians, whether on founding a company or on the occasion of increasing the capital. Shares subscribed by legal entities shall not be included in the reckoning of this percentage. If the full percentage referred to has not been subscribed within the period fixed, which shall not be less than one month, the Minister of Commerce and Industry is here by authorised to extend the closing date of subscriptions for a further period not ex ceeding one month, or to waive the require ment for this percentage in whole or in part. The Minister of Commerce and Industry is hereby authorised, subject to approval of the Council of Ministers, to fix a higher percentage in respect of companies occu pied in work of special national interest. The provisions of this article shall apply both in the case of shares offered for public subscription and in the case of founders subscribing the capital of the company. These provisons, however, shall not apply to companies founded prior to the issue of this law until the period of the company's concession is over; but they shall be ob served in the case of renewal. Art. 7.—It must always be ascertained that shares issued as fully paid up, other wise than in cash (apport shares), in a joint stock company have been correctly valued; the competent court shall nominate one or more experts to carry this out. In such cases the shares of the original subscribers to the capital and apport shares shall not be negotiable before the publica tion of the profit and loss account at least two full years from the date of issue of the decree of incorporation. It is also prohibited to detach these shares from their original counterfoils throughout the whole of this period, and a stamp shall be affixed thereon showing their kind and the date of incorporation of the company. Art. 8.—In respect of joint stock com panies, it is prohibited to negotiate certi ficates of subscription and shares at prices higher than their nominal value plus issue expenses, if any, until the issue of the &lt;^n- pany’s decree of incorporation in respect of the certificates of subscription, and for the period following the issue of the decree of incorporation up to . the publication of the profit and loss account for one full financial year in respect of shares. A rt. 9.—Transactions in shares contrary to the provisions of this law will be null and void, and contraventions will be punished by a fine of not less than £E. 20 and not exceeding £E. 100, and if the seller is a founder member or on the board he will be liable to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months and a fine of not less than £E. 100 and not exceeding £E. 1,000 or one of these two punishments. Art. 10.—Each member of the board of any joint stock company must deposit shares amounting to l/50th of the capital of the company, unless the statutes of the company state that the qualifying shares should not be more than £E. 1,000. The shares owned by a director of a joint stock company shall be earmarked as a guarantee for his conduct of the affairs of the company, and shall be deposited at one of the banks approved by the Ministry of Finance for the purpose. Failure to deposit these shares at an approved bank will result in his ceasing to be a director. These shares shall remain deposited and shall not be negotiable until the expiry of his term of office, and approval of the final statement of account for the last year during which he has performed his duties. Art. 11.—Officials delegated by the Minister of Commerce and Industry will have the authority of police and judicial officers in respect of offences committed in contravention of the provisions of this law and the ministerial orders issued in execu tion thereof. For purposes of control of the execution of the provisions of this law, they shall have the right to inspect registers and books. Managers of companies and those responsible for the management thereof are hereby charged to submit to them the particulars they demand for the purpose. Art. 12.—The Ministers of Commerce and Industry, Social Affairs, Finance and Justice, is as far as their respective Ministries are concerned, are hereby V \ cln wh aft 41En Clair MIDDLE EA$T i QQ* R oo&lt;j D Economic, Supply and Relief / / i MONTHLY ECONOMIC REPORT v .y PEriod S6pt«WlW 1947 Q Telegram from B.M.E.O. to Foreign Office (N\T60. Comply. Saving) 12th November, 1947 Received 17th November, 1947 I.—Persia The question of Russia and oil, in Northern Persia still continues to focus all attention. There is clear evidence that the Tudeh (Communist) Party is reviving. There is still no sign of the return by Russia of the Persian gold held in the Russian bank at Moscow. No payment has been made for customs dues owed by that country. It is reported that arrangements are being made for the rehabilitation of Persian Baluchistan in the way of public construction, agriculture, roads, and posts and telegraphs. 2. An irrigation company has been formed at Jahrum with the help of the Agricultural Bank. The Government has some 50 tons of Persian-grown opium for sale, and one large quantity has been dis posed of to Spain. The governors-general have been reminded of their duty to sup press opium poppy growing. 3. An official arrived from India to negotiate for the purchase of 50,000 tons of barley, but no export licence has yet been granted. There has been no change in the price of food-stuffs. 4. Money has been tight and in strong demand. Gold coins rose sharply in value and smuggling has been reported, especially to India. There has been some delay in meeting foreign and local bills. The Foreign Exchange Committee has issued no permits since 15th July. The free market exchange for rials fell from 225 to 213 per pound sterling on receipt of the news of the impending return of the Governor of the Banque Melli. 5. Regulations for foreign commercial enterprises in Persia are still undisclosed. There have been references to the setting up of an open free port on the Mediter ranean, possibly in Syria. There have also been reports about the joining of the Per sian railway system to that of Iraq and Syria. This is probably wishful thinking. The press announces the formation of an association for economic reform which will deal with imports, exports and the general encouragement of Persian industry. The association is said to be composed of Mem bers of Parliament, merchants, university experts and other experts. The textile market has been dull owing to the diffi culties of replacements. To protect the local matchmaking industry the entry of foreign matches has been banned, but there has been a considerable amount of smuggling of the latter. 6. Markets continue dull and prices high. The Exchange Control Commission still refuses to sell foreign exchange, with the result that orders placed in the United Kingdom are being cancelled. It is prob able that up to 1 million pounds' worth of United Kingdom trade will be lost. All hopes of improvement centre in the return of the Governor of the Banque Melli. 7. Quarantine revision is being under taken since the commencement of the cholera outbreak in Egypt. 8. Transport rates are generally high, partly owing to the fact that vehicles are worn out and costly to run. Small taxicabs are increasing in Tehran and many of the old droshkys are disappearing. 9. Bank-note circulation on 23rd August, 1947 = 6,566,568,310 rials. (Note index is 754, compared with 100 in July 1939.) Cost of living (Tehran only), 22nd August = 451 (447 on 22nd July, 194/). (The figure given in paragraph 8 of the August report was not that of the cor rected average April-August 1939 = 100, and should have read 450.) Wholesale price index (Tehran only), 22nd August = 536 (538 on 22nd July).

Iraq is now faced with a shortage of cereals and is attempting to obtain an allocation from I.E.F.C. It is feared that some cultivators have sold their seed and will be in difficulties at sowing time. 2. Preliminary talks started with the Iraqi Government concerning the alloca tion of scarce currencies. The ban on dollar deals continued, but by a misunder standing was applied only to the United States and Canada. It is believed that the Argentine and Japan have now been included in the scarce currency countries. In spite of the continuance of exchange control difficulties and the ban on dollar credits, the value of documentary credits for abroad was the highest this year. There was a rise in the price of cotton textiles and building materials. 3.

It was explained that holdings had accumu- lated to £20 million. IV. — The Levant States (a) Syria It appears that Government policy in regard to expenditure on irrigation development may be changed in that, instead of, as hitherto, spreading the amounts available yearly over numerous projects, the authorities are planning to allot £8.2,500,000 in the next budget to complete the Khabur development project and another relatively large sum to cover the full working expenses for a year on a project in the Hauran. 2. The trend of cereal collections in Syria during September has continued satisfactorily, and it is estimated that the M.I.R.A. organisation may have approxi mately enough stocks of all cereals to cover the country s requirements. The Syrian authorities have also decided to implement the policy of mixing wheat with other cereals. It is, furthermore, considered that the Syrian and Lebanese Governments will, eventually, come to an agreement con^m- ing the supply to the Lebanon of up to 10,000 tons of wheat. By ministerial decree No. 801 of 17th September, pub lished in the Official Gazette No. 42 of 25th September, the transport of bran out of Syria was prohibited. 3. In Aleppo on 6th September, rioting took place as a result of the high cost of flour. The situation was calmed by promises of better distribution in the future. Retail prices of food-stuffs are in fact rising steadily as the result of seasonal shortages and hoarding by producers. On 8th September the Arab Engineers’ Con ference met in Damascus with representa tives of all Arab countries. It was succeeded on the 13th by the Arab Antiquities, likewise attended by all Arab States and a representative of the Sultan of Morocco. 4. A press report states that the Director of the Department of Agriculture, accom panied by experts of the Department and by a Mr. Mettenson (described as an U.N.R.R.A. representative and expert on agricultural ecology), are to tour the Mohafazates of Homs, Hama, Aleppo, Euphrates, Jezireh and Lattakia, to study agricultural conditions. The purpose of the tour is said to be to enable Mr. Metten son to make a report and recommendations regarding agricultural development. 5. The press has, throughout the month, commented on the impending Franco-Syro- Libano currency negotiations. The gist of these reports is, generally, that the Levant States do not wish their currency to remain bound to the French currency, but it is also intimated, in some newspapers, that the existing link is unavoidable in the present economic circumstances. It is, further more, stated that the negotiations will be concerned with other than purely currency matters, and, in this connexion, the press refers to claims by the French Government for large amounts, alleged to be owed by Syria for various services and properties devolving from the period of the mandate. As against this it is stated that Syria can put forward claims which more than counter-balance the French ones. Hassan Bey Jabbara, the Syrian delegate on the Higher Council of Common Interests, with the Syrian Minister to France, are to represent Syria in these negotiations.3 6. The press reports that the Directorate- General of Customs has indicated that exports of gold from Syria and the Lebanon are subject to export licences granted by the Higher Council of Common Interests upon the recommendation of the respective GU^rnments. This report is interesting in that it states that, as a result of this decision, the “ foreign Consular Corps ” are not authorised to carry any amount of gold when leaving the Levant States. 7. The following figures on French imports and exports were recently pub lished in the press in respect of the first five months of 194fi and 1947 :— £ sterling Syro-Libano joint exports to France— 1946 986,389,000 1947 202,141,000 French francs Syro-Libano joint imports from France— 1946 ?, 130,504,000 1947 1,008,481,000 8. Though it is not yet known to what extent the authorities will implement the decision not to grant, or to restrict the num ber of import licences in connexion with which no corresponding applications for foreign exchange (hard currencies) are sub mitted, a recent press communique issued by the Directorate for Foreign Trade and Supplies indicates some intention of pur suing this policy. The communique in question points out that import licences en dorsed for foreign exchange allocations, granted before 14th July, 1947, may not be substituted for licences not so endorsed, already issued, or granted after that date, i.e., it is intended that the foreign ex change allocated should be used to import the goods for which it was granted. How ever, the communique provides for excep tions being made to this ruling, subject to an application with justifying documents being submitted to the competent authori ties, to obtain an endorsement showing that the import licences not entitling the im porter to foreign exchange have been duly amended. The conclusion to be drawn— in British exporters’ interests—is that the previous recommendation, only to execute orders or ship goods when a definite as surance that an import licence and alloca tion of sterling are available, or when an irrevocable credit has been opened, should be maintained. 9. A press report states that, in his report to the Lebanese Government, the Lebanese representative to the Inter national Trade Conference (Ml. Moussa Moubarek) has indicated that the Czecho- 34420-23 Slovak Government would be prepared to purchase surplus quantities of Lebanese tobacco, against supplies of telegraph and telephone poles from Czechoslovakia to Syria. 10. The representative in Damascus of Pan-American Airways is reported to have indicated that the present fortnightly ser vice from Damascus to New York is to be expanded to a weekly service in the near future. The single fare on this service is stated to be $615. Ten “Harvard” training aircraft, for the Syrian Air Force, are at present being assembled at Damascus aerodrome, while delivery of a further ten from the United States is expected in the near future. The equipment of these aircraft can be con verted for various purposes, including light bombing. By decree No. 895 published in the Official Gazette No. 41 of 18th September, 1947, exemption is granted to aircraft of the Diplomatic Corps from all fees men tioned in Decree No. 322 of 18th March, 1947, on the basis of reciprocity. 11. The agreement between Syria and the Tapline Company, covering way-leave rights for a pipe-line through Syrian terri tory to the Lebanese coast, was finally signed at the beginning of the month; the agreement requires approval by the Syrian Chamber of Deputies. Apart from the con vention concerning the way-leave rights, it is understood that the agreement covers, by an exchange of letters, the possibility for Syria to purchase up to 175,000 tons yearly of crude oil at cost price before refining. Press reports indicate that the Tapline engineers have already selected two alterna tive routes for the pipe-line; one of these is said to run through 70 kilometres of Syrian territory, the other being 200 kilometres long. A decision by the com pany is awaited concerning which route is to be adopted. The press reports that negotiations have begun between the Syrian Government and the Iraq Petroleum Company in regard to the construction of a second pipe-line between Mosul and Tripoli (Lebanon), and also with the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany concerning their projected pipe-line. 12. Damascus: Gold prices at 1st October, 1947— Sovereigns = 42 • 15-42 • 25 £S. Five Tola Bar = 245 £S. (b) The Lebanon 13. The Government and the general public are still concerned about the cereals situation during the coming winter and all b 2Government holdings of dollars and ster ling have been blocked to allow for the official purchases which the Government is trying to negotiate in the Western hemis phere and in Australia. An application for assistance has been made to the Soviet Government and is being pursued by the Lebanese Minister in Moscow. In order to ease the situation meanwhile a decree has been published allowing the import of wheat and flour on private account without import licence. The price of food-stuffs, especially sugar and cooking fat, has risen since last month. 14. Preliminary work has begun on the new civil airport at Khaldd, near Beirut. The Lebanese Ministry of Public Works have obtained from the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company the use of equipment and the services of technicians to assist in the levelling of the ground. The final plans and layout have still not been approved. A civil air agreement has been signed between Lebanon and Turkey. 15. A convention was signed on 23rd August between the Lebanese Government and the Compagnie Fran^aise des Petroles giving the latter the right to erect and operate oil refineries in the Lebanon for a period of seventy years. 16. The expected influx of American employees of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company has led to an increase in rents and to a large increase in the wages asked by domestic labour. The high wages offered by the company are attracting numbers of workers from other employment, including Government departments, and the Ministry of Public Works is reported to have opened discussions with the company in order that the latter may adopt wage scales more in accordance with local standards. 17. Wholseale Price Index, September 1947 = 790. Cost of living, August 1947 = 490 (July 1947 = 487), (July-August 1939 = 100). (Note .—The leading commercial journal, Le Commerce du Levant, disputes the official figures, asserting that from an analysis of the prices of six staple food commodities the cost of living index figure should be 640.) Currency circulation at 30th September, 1947 = £Leb. 151,000,000. Gold prices at 1st October, 1947— Sovereigns = 42 • 10-42 • 15. Five Tola Bar = 247-248. V.—Palestine Activity was concentrated upon preparations for winter cereals; including ploughing, manuring and the securing of seed supplies. Except in the Gaza district, the area that has been tractor-ploughed is larger than last year and the present high price of grain has provided the necessary incentive to farmers to concentrate on cereals rather than on pulses. In^^he drought-stricken areas Government is pro viding a loan of £P.75,000 to assist im poverished farmers to pay for their tractor- ploughing. The distribution of grain and fodder in these areas is continuing. The area that will be dry sown (“ Afir ”) is likely to be smaller than usual; farmers are re luctant to risk the small supplies of seed at their disposal and in many places the draught animals are too weak to plough the ground before it has been softened by the rains. 2. The production of Palestine standard flour was maintained in September at the August level of over 11,000 tons. As no barley was available and stocks of rye were practically exhausted, Palestine standard flour was produced from imported wheat and wheat flour in the proportion of 65 per cent, to 35 per cent., the wheat being milled to 90 per cent. In the cereal group prices generally remained firm at the former high level. Wheat is still quoted at £P.63 and barley at £P.40 per ton; prices were some what lower in the Gaza district, where the Government distribution of these grains is in progress. The price of maize fell from £P.38 to £P.34 per ton following a Govern ment import of 7,500 tons of maize from Turkey. The import and distribution of grain and fodder by Government has had a steadying effect on the market. The tobacco crop is in the process of curing; yields this year were only fair. 3. Imports of cattle remained inadequate to build up a sufficient reserve in the country. Importers of Turkish cattle experience great difficulty in obtaining export licences as the Turkish Government have not yet fixed the export quota for live stock for the coming year, while the Government of Iraq does not issue licences for export of cattle to Palestine. The expansion of the ploughed-up area has worsened the plight of that large majority of livestock that is unfortunate enough to be dependent for its existence upon natural grazing. Working animals are being hand- fed with kersenneh and tibben, but village cattle, sheep and goats have to forage hard to find enough food to keep themselves alive. The situation was aggravated by the influx into some areas of large flocks from neigh bouring countries. The sheep and goat6 10. The tanning industry has shown some slight improvement as the result of a recent agreement between the tanners and importers, under the auspices of the Jewish Agency, to restrict imports of sole leather. A number of small concerns producing fancy leather goods, so far mainly for export to continental European countries, are at present faced with marketing diffi culties, and the setting up of an organisa tion to handle the sale of their products abroad is under consideration. 11. Production in the diamond industry is on the increase. The number of workers in full employment is now placed at 2,500, i.e., 60 per cent, of that employed by the industry at the peak of its production. Exporters and manufacturers are being en couraged to re-establish their export trade, which was previously mainly to the United States. There is sufficient raw material in the country to supply the industry for approximately three months at the present rate of employment. Export of polished diamonds during September amounted to 2,546 carats valued at £P.75,997—of which the United States took 2,044 carats valued at £P.59,725. Exports during August amounted to 2,060 carats valued at £P.57,499. Imports of roughs during Sep tember from syndicate sources amounted to 26,766 carats, valued at £P.7l,870, and from non-syndicate sources 9,305 carats valued at £P.49,411. 12. The output of the Nesher Cement Plant continued to show an increase. Im ports came virtually to a standstill as a result of the high cost of the foreign pro duct. The erection of the Olamith Asbestos Cement Works near Petah Tiqva is near ing completion. 13. A subsidiary of the Palestine Potash, Limited (Fertilisers and Chemicals, Limited), is shortly to erect works near Haifa, for the production of sulphuric acid, potassium sulphate, high-grade sul phur, phosphate and di-calcium phosphate. The firm’s capital is said to amount to £P.550,000. 14. In view of the continuous gradual increase in the consumption of electric power and the anticipated still further in crease in demand, the Palestine Electric Corporation is taking steps to double its production capacity within the next three years from 230 million kw. to 450 million kw. An agreement to cover the supply of power from the Palestine Electric Cor poration to the Jerusalem Electric and Public Services Co. was recently concluded between the two companies. 15. Drilling of oil is in progress near Gaza by one of the subsidiaries of the Iraq Petroleum Co. The plant used is mainly of United Kingdom manufacture, made to United States specifications. The labour, force used by the company has been re cruited from nearby villages. 16. The external trade for June was Imports ... ••• =£6,931,463 Exports ... •• =£2,029,795 17. Cost of living index, September = 285 (June 1947 = 275; September 1946 = 273). Wholesale price index, September = 364 -2 (base June 1936 = 100); September 1946 = 351-5. Currency in circulation, 30th September = £43,057,805 (notes = 41,544,904) (a de crease of £1-5 million from August 1947). Total deposits of banks and credit: Co operative societies at 31st August = £98,080,333 (excluding balances held by banks for credit co-operative societies amounting to £4,739,440). Total deposits at 31st July = £98,576,021 (a decrease of £495,488). Total credit outstanding at 31st August = £43,778,883; total credit outstanding at 31st July = £42,840,423 (an increase of £938,460). Customs and excise revenue continues buoyant. Monthly receipts from customs and excise during 194/ were : — Customs Excise Total £P. £P. £P.

During September five strikes of short duration came to notice, of which four occurred at small undertakings and one at a textile factory. According to the General Jewish Labour Exchange, 9,606 applicants were registered as unemployed in August 1947. At the end of August 1947 the number of applicants for employment, Arabs and Jews, on the “ live ” index of the employment register for ex-servicemen and women was 1,370, as compared with 4,535 at the end of August 1946. YI.—Transjordan The price of wheat has now risen to £P.90 per ton, a price beyond the means of the majority of the inhabitants of the country. Two hundred and forty tons of7 rice were received from Egypt during the month. This allotment. is the first to be received since December 1946. In general, all prices of local produce have risen to fantastic heights with little hope that the ceiling has been reached. %fcThe Transjordan Government have decided to buy a block of shares in the Arab Airways Association, and to be repre sented on the board of directors in the future. 3. The price of the gold sovereign was £P.4-600 mils at the end of September 1947. YII.—Cyprus During the quarter July-September, in general drought conditions prevailed. Owing to poor crops last season there is likely to be a keen demand for seed wheat and barley from Government-held stocks, and arrangements are being made to re serve an extra 1,000 tons of each. The sesame crop is considerably below earlier estimates, due to unfavourable climatic conditions. Cotton production is moderate. There were abundant supplies of apples at low prices, owing to lack of overseas demand. Pears, peaches and plums were a good average crop, and grapes were moderate. Carob production was fair and prices were very good, up to 70s. per kantar (504 lb.). Tobacco was harvested and cured under favourable conditions and the demand for leaf from the previous crop increased. In general, the prices of all agricultural products were at a re munerative level. The conditions for natural grazing deteriorated as a result of hot weather, and the rains in the early part of the quarter caused further damage to stubble grazing. There was, however, sufficient food for flocks, especially in the plains. Supplies of cheese were plentiful. Exports of live stock included seventy-nine mules to Egypt and sixty-five donkeys to Rhodes. 2. The harvesting, cleaning and packing of the whole of the 1947 crop of seeds for export was completed. Ihe main consign ment consisting of cauliflower and broccoli seed was shipped to the United Kingdom in August. The second and final consign ment was moved to the port for shipment in September. The total seed crop is esti mated at 32,2051b.. with a total gross value of £38,062, as against 3,393 lb. with a total gross value of £5,453 for 1946. Yields per donum (3-025 donums = 1 acre) showed a large increase on last year. A draft Seed Production Act has been pre pared and its object will be to enable tlu Department of Agriculture to declare segregated areas for seed production. Stock seed of several varieties of zinnia is being multiplied for the 1948 contract growers at the Central Experimental Farm at Morphou. 3. Investigations are being carried out on the decreased tannin content of Cyprus sumac. 4. It is estimated that the citrus crop will be much below the average with the exception of grapefruit and lemons. Negotiations are still in progress with the E T nited Kingdom authorities and foreign buyers and no sales have yet been arranged. The vintage crop is estimated to have been 30 per cent, less in quantity than 1946, but the quality is considered good with a high sugar percentage. The quota granted to Cyprus for export of wine and brandy to the United Kingdom amounts to a total value of £475,000. Exports during the quarter were :— Wine, 185,978 gallons. Brandy. 7,842 gallons. Raisins, 118,989 lb. Concentrated grape j uice, 70| tons. 5. It is estimated that about 4,500 oz. of silkworm eggs will be produced by the licensed egg producers for the next silk season. Permits for the import of 600 oz. of eggs were issued. Lhe price of silk reeled in the local hand-reeling appa ratuses increased during September from £4-10 to £5 per oke (1 oke = 2-8 lb.). 6. Tractor ploughing has gained in creased popularity and threshing of cereals by machines is on the increase. Poultry keeping is becoming more popular and a good number of incubators which arrived recently were readily taken up. 7. The principal exports of agricultural produce from 1st July to 30th September were (1946 figures are given in brackets) :— Okes ,924,618 (4,052,295) ,723,200 (1,734,530) 75,606 ( 201,914) 34.499 ( 31,176) 16.700 ( 28,552) 37,667 ( 89,863) 68,954 ( 16,433) 16,759 ( 27,975) 44.499 ( 51,120) 27,475 ( 12,399) 46,524 ( 16,337) 11,510 ( ... ) Alepfo kantars 29,503 ( 15,816) Okes 12.700 ( ... ) Potatoes Onions ... Pomegranates ... Raisins ... Dried figs Almonds, unshelled Tobacco, yellow leaf Tobacco, latakia Ground pine bark Aniseed ... Cumin Vegetable seeds Carobs kibbled ... Wool 8. Imports and exports during Septem ber totalled £1,000,999 and £668,349 respectively. 9. An interesting commentary upon the present prosperity of Cyprus and the cost8 of living is provided by the decision of the Akel-controlled Co-operative, the Vine Products Society, to appoint its own chemist at a salary of £3.000 a year. 10. A 10 per cent, increase in the wages of all Government daily wages employees was authorised as from 19th September. No significant changes have been made in the wage rates of private employees. 11. Cost-of-living index at 1st Septem ber (six points above August figure), 277. Notes in circulation at 30th Septem ber, £5,883,640. Deposits in commercial banks at 30th September, £10,578,217. YIIL—Egypt A new company, the Arab Land Com pany, S.A.E., with a capital of £E.l million, has been formed to assist Arab landowners in Palestine with mortgage loans and loans for purchase of fertilisers, goods, cattle and implements, &amp;c, with a view to preventing the continued sale of Arab-owned land to Jewish interests. The company’s statutes also authorise the pur chase of land for reclamation and subse quent sale to Arabs, and the granting of loans to Arab farmers and co-operative societies for the same purpose. Two other new companies formed are the Societe Egyptienne de Divulgation, S.A.E., with a capital of £E.10,000, and the Nile Insurance Company, S.A.E., with a capital of £E.500,000. Law No. 129 of 1947, published in the Journal Officiel No. 87, of 18th September, lays down new conditions for the grant of concessions to public utility companies in Egypt. 2. The first estimate of the 1947 cotton crop was recently issued and totals 6,004,000 kantars, plus 114,000 kantars of “ Escarto ” or low-grade cotton. THs is only about 88,000 kantars above the final estimate of the 1946 crop. 3. Two decree-laws have been promul gated fixing the areas tc be planted with cotton and cereals next year, to enable Egypt to meet the serious shortage of wheat with which she is faced. Not more than 27 per cent, of the total cultivable land in the northern part of the delta and 20 per cent, of land in other parts of the country may be planted with cotton (except Aswan Province, where cotton growing is totally prohibited). Not less than 35 per cent, of cultivable land in the northern part of the delta is to be planted with cereals, a minimum of 20 per cent, of which must be planted with wheat. In the rest of the country the cereal area is to be 50 per cent, with a minimum of 40 per cent, in Lower Egypt and 45 per cent, in Upper Egypt planted with wheat. The 1947-48 cotton export season has opened very quietly and only 32,366 bales were shipped in September, the United States taking about one-half of this quantity. 4. The following are the figures officially given as the wheat and barley yields for 1947 as compared with 1946 :— ,4 re a 1946-47 1945-46 Yield 1946-47 1945-46 Average yield per acre 1946-47 1945-46 Acres Acres Tons Tons Lb.

Whfint. 1,629,670 1,585,987 1,044,000 1,163,000 1,407 1,614 Barley 237,408 244,825 170,000 178,000 1,788 1,815 First estimates of the 1947 millet and maize (Seifi) crops are as under: Five-year average 1947 1946 1942-46 Ardebs Ardebs Ardebs Millet ... 3,822,000 3,407.000 4,943,000 Maize 187,000 79,000 181,000 5. Conditions were quiet on the local Bourses during September, with a slight downward trend in prices, despite the fact that commercial capital is once more being invested in stocks and shares owing to the stagnation of the import and export trade. There was some speculation in the less important shares. 6. Bills of exchange protested for non payment in August totalled 946, compared with 901 in July, and a monthly average of about 700 for the first half of the year. Three bankruptcies were declared in July 1947, compared with nil in the correspond ing month of 1946. 7. For the first time, following the steady decline in the cost-of-living index figure which has occurred this year, the July figure rose by 2^ points over that of June. Having regard to the restrictions placed on imports in recent months following Egypt’s departure from the sterling area, it seems likely that the index figure will continue to rise.9 8. Foreign trade figures are as follows :— Total Trade (including bullion and specie) Jan.-July 1946 £E. Imports 46,630,000 Exports and re-exports ... 34,462,000 Trade balance ... -12,168,000 No further detailed figures of imports and exports have been issued since those for February 1947. 9. Cost of Living Index (Basis : June- August 1939 = 100) :— 1946- December 1947— 289-1 March ... 277-9 April ... 277-0 May 275-4 June 274-4 July ... 276-9 Bank-note issue at 31st August, 1947, = £E.130 million. Bank-note issue at 31st August, 1946, = £E.139 million. IX.—Sudan The following are some of the principal exports from the Sudan in September 1947 :— Tons Value in £E. Cotton, ginned ... 2,304 416,567 Cotton seed ... ... 7,875 141,758 Gum, all kinds ... 2,504 129,642 Melon seed ... ... 1,654 61,227 Fish, salted ... 308 18,451 Maize 3,697 85,037 Head Cattle ... 1,299 18,186 Sheep ... 2,338 7,014 Cotton piece-goods imported into the Sudan in September 1947 amounted to 327 tons (value £E.207,915), of which 115 tons (value £E.84,800) came from Egypt, 164 tons (value £E.63,917) from India, 9 tons (value £E. 17,487) from Italy, 19 tons (value £E.21,829) from Great Britain, 11 tons (value £E.9,327) from United States and 9 tons (value £E.10,555) from other countries. This gives some idea of the Sudan's difficulty in obtaining textiles. X.—Saudi Arabia American exports to Saudi Arabia in 1946 are said to have been $19 million in value. Of this total, stores and equipment for Aramco constituted by far the larger part. United Kingdom exports to Saudi Arabia totalled a mere £456,000 during the same period. In passing it may be noted 34420-23 Jan.-July 1947 ' £E. 56,274,000 + 9,644,000 48,525,000 +14,063,000 - 7,749,000 that United Kingdom exports to Saudi Arabia during the first half of 1947 also totalled £456,000, representing exactly twice the rate for 1946. There can, however, be no doubt that the volume of American commercial exports to Saudi Arabia is substantially greater than the British, nor can this superiority be wholly accounted for by the greater suita bility of American vehicles for Saudi Arabian road conditions. The American exporter suffers from a serious disability vis-a-vis his British competitor as a result of the premium at which the dollar is quoted against the £, but this disability he has so far discounted by speedy delivery and an ability to deliver food-stuffs and cotton grey sheetings, for which local demand is acute. Sterling is becoming a relatively scarce currency in Saudi Arabia as a result of the abolition of limitation of the convertibility of Indian and Egyptian currency, and serious thought must now be given to the kind of exports from the United Kingdom which can compete with American products at the official rate of exchange. 2. Messrs. International Bechtel, Incor porated, are now actively engaged in grading and surfacing the streets of Jedda. An incident in this process has been the demolition of the city walls. The Jedda-Medina road has been graded over a . length of 200 kilom., but since no sur facing has been effected, the road will doubtless revert to its original condition within a matter of weeks. A survey party has examined the Mecca-Taif road between Sharaya and Taif. This section of road passes through mountainous country, and major engineering feats may be in con templation. It is now virtually certain that any con tract for harbour works at Jedda will be awarded to Messrs. Bechtel. Messrs. Aramco are to undertake an aerial survey of Jedda harbour for this purpose. 3. Certain local inflationary effects are. however, already evident from Messrs. Bechtel’s activities. The daily rate paid by them to unskilled labourers has attained c10 the level of 4 riyals, plus overtime which may bring the total up to 7 riyals (over 10s.). From Mecca it is credibly reported that local contractors are paying Egyptian labourers 10 riyals (say 15s.) a day, while skilled Egyptian workmen engaged upon concrete mixing are paid at the rate of £E.l daily. One consequence of this development is that Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey are already seriously embarrassed by their inability to secure labour for the completion of the Jedda water-scheme. 4. It is rumoured that 30 million newly minted riyals from the United States are about to arrive at Jedda. This quantity alone is approximately four times the total in circulation in 1939. As the rival is already overvalued by reference to its value as bullion, it will be interesting to see what effect continued heavy arrivals have on the exchanges. 5. Aramco have informed His Majesty’s Legation that the establishment of a plant for the production of tetra-ethyl lead in the Persian Gulf by Messrs. Associated Ethyl Corporation, Limited (a British firm), is under consideration. Representatives of the firm have already visited Dhahran, and it is understood that their activities included an investigation into the possi bility of extracting bromine from the sea. 6. From 1st January, 1947, to 25th September, 1947, 177 vessels entered Jedda harbour. Of this total, sixty-six were British and twenty-four American. XL—Persian Gulf B.A.P.C.O. have had to make an immedi ate increase of Rs. 1 / - a day in the wages of the whole of their Arab staff and will possibly make further increases to their Arab artisans in the near future. This has been done to discourage emigration to Dhahran where Aramco have had to make large increases in the wages paid to their Arab employees in Saudi Arabia due to Ibn Sa'ud’s insistence that they should be paid at the same rates as the company’s Italian and Indian labour. It is, as yet, early to say what effect these increases will have on other employers of labour in Bahrein and on labour employed by the Kuwait Oil Company and Petroleum Con cessions in Qatar, but difficulties may be expected early in the new year when Aramco get busy with their new projects for which they will require, they say, about 10,000 extra Arab labourers. 2. Syrian Airways have started a weekly service between Damascus and Dhahran via Bagdad largely to meet the needs of Aramco. As a result of the visit of their assistant general manager to Kuwait they have now applied for permission to land at Kuwait cargo, mail and traffic. XII. —British Somaliland There has been a general refusal tojtake out charcoal burning licences under the new ordinance, which raised the fees to try and stop the excessive cutting of trees. Any charcoal reaching the towns at present is smuggled, but recent convictions may persuade the burners to pay the increased fee. 2. The “ Karin ” rains have been excel lent at Hargeisa and between Hargeisa and Borama, but Borama itself and the main agricultural areas of that district have not had their fair share. 3. Mr. Dowson,* a date growing expert from Iraq, is visiting the country at the invitation of the administration to advise on the possibilities of date growing on a large scale. His first investigations are to be made on the coast between Zeilah and Berbera. 4. Under the new kat ordinance, with effect from 1st October, the customs duty on kat is to be abolished and an excise duty levied instead. The sale of kat in each district is to be allowed by one merchant only who is to purchase the right to sell kat in public auction. One of the main objects of this ordinance is to bring the sale of this drug into the open so that the extent of its use can be reasonably accurately estab lished. The auctions to be held in Hargeisa and Borama were boycottecf by the public. It is believed that the would-be buyers were frightened by threats from the numbers of town loafers, who make some sort of a living as pedlars of kat. XIII. —Desert Locust Situation Breeding continued in North-West Darfur, Northern Kordofan, Khartoum and Northern Blue Nile Province and in Shendi and Kassala districts of the Sudan. In Eritrea the hopper infestations near Agordat, Keren and the Anseba valley were heavy and breeding was also reported from the northern and eastern highlands, the Baraka valley, the western lowlands near the Sudan border and from Axum near the Ethiopian border. Breeding took place in the Southern Tigre and Danakil and in the reserved areas of Ethiopia. 2. The southerly movement of swarms in the central plateau of British Somaliland continued and there was some breeding near the border of the reserved areas and in the Benadir Province of Somalia near the Kenya border.11 3. Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika and all the northern territories from Egypt to India remained clear. XIY.—Middle East Oil nUnce world oil production for 1946 was about 33 per cent, over 1938, it is the more astonishing that we should be faced—as we undoubtedly are to-day—with a formidable problem of oil supply. The immediate cause is the unparalleled growth of post war consumption of petroleum products— particularly in the United States. Neither could the tempo of this growth have been foreseen, nor could the oil industries have done much about it; for to make up the lee way an immense amount of development and construction work is needed. There is no basic lack of oil, indeed proven under ground reserves are greater than ever. What is lacking are adequate pipe-lines, refineries, storage, tankers and the rest to move oil from the wells, treat it, ship it and distribute it among consumers the world over. The oil industries’ vast and highly efficient equipment is now being strained to the limit by unprecedented demand. 2. The United States, in former years one of the main sources of oil exports, has now become a net importer and the export surplus of Latin America (the Caribbean) will tend more and more to be absorbed by North America, leaving the Middle East eventually to redress the balance for the Old World. The proven underground reserves of the Middle Eastern fields are now believed to represent not less than 50 per cent, of the world’s total. Compared Avith some 15 million tons pre-war, Middle East production has now reached the order of 40 million tons a year, representing about 10 per cent, of world requirements or 25 per cent, of those of the eastern hemi sphere. The extraction of oil from these fields can be expanded readily enough. But it is on the construction of trunk pipe lines and much greater refinery capacity that an ample flow of the Middle East oil to the markets must wait. 3. Against this background, priority of importance among events this month obviously attaches to the signing on 1st September of Tapline’s wayleave con vention with Syria which, after protracted negotiations, had left the way clear for the Americans to get on with the construction of their trunk pipe-line from Saudi Arabia to the Levant coast, a job which they noAv reckon on completing in two years. 4. Meanwhile, work on the 16-in. line, which I.P.C. are laying from Kirkuk to Haifa, is going ahead well and will eventually step up the flow of oil to Haifa by some 4 million tons a year. 5. Exploratory drilling by I.P.C., suspended during the war, has recently been resumed at several points : notably in Syria (near Aleppo), in Lebanon (on the outskirts of Tripoli), and in Palestine (the first to be attempted in that country) in the neigh bourhood of Gaza. 6. In Egypt exploratory drilling is going steadily ahead in Sinai. At Sudr in Sinai, about 40 miles south of Suez, A.E.O. are now developing production and the first crude oil from this new field, the possibili ties of which are interesting from the Egyptian point of view, is expected to be shipped before the end of the year to the Suez refinery. 7. The production of crude at KuAvait, Avhich only made a beginning last year, is already of the order of 2 million tons a year and it is anticipated that this rate will be more than doubled in the near future. 8. Shipments from the Abadan refinery have been maintained over the past quarter at twice the pre-war level.
