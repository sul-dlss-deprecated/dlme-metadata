On a recent visit of a flying boat to KHOR JARAMA, the mooring chain and pennants of the old moor ing were picked up whilst v^eighing anchor. These were buoyed with an oil drum in order that a visiting sloop might find the mooring more easily. 2. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf has now reported tnat this temporary buoy has already been removed by the local natives. 3* ^ It is thought that, unless some arrangement can be made with the local Sheikh, any buoy laid will also disappear. 4* It is,therefore, requested that you will be good enough to approach the Sheikh with a view to coming to some agreement with him for safeguarding the buoy, before arrangements for a mooring are made.

I visited Sur leaving Muscat on November 26th and •pent an interesting day seeing the town and exchanging calls with tha Wall and four principal Shaikhs, Nasir bin Mohammed, Hamad bin Khalfan, Salim bin Nasir and Abdullah bin Nasir. 3. I think qy visit caused some curiosity and shortly before I was due to leave Muscat I received a letter from Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Minister of the Interior, asking if I would be good enough to give passage to two of his men whom he wished to •end to Sur on urgent business. I saw no object in refusing but have the feeling that their business was primarily to find out mine, I was in any case closely shepherded throughout ny visit and unable to find out anything fresh in connection with the H Star of Mex H incident. 4* On the way back I paid a visit to Khor Jarama, which is only about two hours by launch from Sur. I was most Impressed by what I saw. It is a large inlet sheltered, and with a deep though narrow and winding entrance, and must be a very fine sea plane landing place. There is a petrol store in excellent condition on the Southern shore and there was I understand, until recently a mooring buoy, this has either sunk or been removed. I was greatly Impressed by the inlet's possibilities as a landing place and could not help but be surprised that the Royal Air Force had not asked us to * Include it when negotiating the Air Agreement. 5c/.

This was unfavourably reported upon by Mr. Lloyd Taylor as a flying boat base. The water area of sufficient depth is not more than It miles in any direction and the Khor is bounded on the north, east and west by rocks up to 200* high. Figures recently given at Air Headquarters gave a minimum water run of 2,500 yards followed by a minimum climbing angle of 1 in 50, 1 in 100 preferably. If these figures are correct the use of Khor Jarama by modern flying boats is precluded. It has been recommended that, if Khor Jarama is used as an alighting area, a road should be constructed to Khor Hajar which is much more suitable for unloading stores. The present tract is not motorable. The sea entrance to Khor Jarama is dangerous. An H.A.F. Petrol Store consisting of two 4,000 gallon bulk tanks exists in a stone building on the site indicated - on the sketch. An early policy decision regarding Khor Jarama is required.Mr* Mohammad bin Nasib came to see you when you were out. He asked me to inform you that he has engaged two dhows and is paying detention charges at Rs. 6/- per dhow per day. He requests that Basra authorities may be informed of this*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0002e7_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/95</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0002e7</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/95</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 2/18 R.
