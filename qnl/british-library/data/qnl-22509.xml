I am now informed by our London Representative that the firm B. &amp; R. Redwood insists upon making inside measurement for calibra tion purposes. This means that such calibration will have to be done before any oil is put in the tanks, such method of measurement is contrary to International oilfield practice and I understand is only used in calibrating ships* tanks where outside measurement is impracticable. However, we are not averse to any method which Redwood cares to use but it will mean their representative will have to be here much sooner than I previously informed you. The first tank will be completed and ready to fill with water for testing on May 15, the second tank will be completed June 1, a nd the third tank about July 1. I am informing my London Office by telegram that the representative of the firm chosen to make the calibrations should be in Bahrein not later than May 10. I might add that our plan is to start running oil to the sitra tanks as soon after May 15 as possible. This is absolutely necessary in order to have sufficient oil to start shipping by July 1.

Although I have pointed out in my letter to you of the 17th December 1933 that my Company is under no legal obligation to refine oil, my Company was then already giving very careful consideration to the pos sibilities for refining oil in Bahrein® As you are aware, the Company has Just installed a Topping plant at Bahrein for experimental purposes and in the hope of being able to sup ply some of its own immediate needs® Obviously, therefore, the question of refining for local consumption must be postponed until its practicability has been definitely determined by the results of the experiments® But in regard to the possibilities for refining oil in Bahrein for purposes of export to countries outside Bahrein of the refined products of the crude oil, it is apparent that this question embraces one of the most important factors involved in producing oil and in finding markets for production and safeguarding those markets® My Company assumes that His Excellency has not considered his request from the angle of the reduction of output resulting as a consequence of the Company being bound by an obligation to refine in Bahrein oil for export abroad® Therefore, my Company desires that it should be explained to His Excellency that the outlet which must be established for the dis position of the products of the Company may demand crude oil alone orpartly crude oil and partly refined products® TMs depends upon factors which cannot be controlled by any producing company Ibr any given period upon a given basis* To attempt to give any assurance tliat any particular proportion of the oil produced in Bahrein will be refined in Bahrein for export abroad would bind my Company in the face of continually uncertain and changeable world-wide market conditions, to a fixed program which might well fatally hamper the Company in the disposal of its production. It would limit my Company*s freedom of action unnecessarily and Inadvisedly in a way which would seriously impair, if not destroy, the chances of a successful enterprise# Upon the quantity of crude oil produced, depends the revenue, beyond the minimum royalty revenue, to be derived by His Excellency from the exploitation of his oilfields.

Z. 1304/34 dated the 26th ^ February 1934 concerning the Refining of oil in Bahrain. I have to inform you that the Company appreciates the kindly and gracious assistance accorded by His Excellency the Sheikh of Bahrain in allowing the Company to proceed with the necessary installations in Bahrain and Sitrah Islands in order to facilitate its work there and that such assistance will be taken fully into account by the Company in considering the changes which His Excellency wishes to have made in the Mining Lease. Here permit me to say that the practical co-operation which has always existed between His Excellency and the HI Company leads the Company to believe that on the other hand His Excellency will not be unmindful of the fact that the i ' 1 Company has met the desires of His Excellency by commencing its operations considerably in advance of the time required and in keeping consistently ahead of the requirements under the Concession.

Whitehall, S.W.I. . ch: 10 THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPMY LIMITED, 19, Moorgate, London, E.G.2. 16th April 1934. 'With regard to the question of the refining in Bahrain of the crude oil produced there. Although Mr. Skinner has pointed out in his letter to H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain of the 17th December 1933 that the Company is under no legal obligation to refine oil, the Company was then already giving very careful consideration to the possibilities for refining oil in Bahrain. As you are no doubt aware, the Company has recently installed a 'topping' plant at Bahrain for experimental purposes and in the hope of being able to supply its own needs. Obviously, therefore, the question of refining for local consumption must be postponed until after its practicability has been definitely determined bjr the results of the Company's experiments. In regard to the possibilities for refining oil in Bahrain for purposes of export to Countries outside Bahrain of the refined products of the crude oil, it is apparent that this question embraces one of the most important factors involved in producing oil and in finding markets for productic and safeguarding those markets. 'The Company assumes that His Excellency has not considered his request from the angle of the reduction of output resulting as a consequence of the Company being bound by an obligation to refine in Bahrain oil for export abroad. Therefore, the Company desires that it should be explained to His Excellency that the outlet which must be established for the disposition of the products of the Company may demand crude oil alone or partly crude oil and partly refined product This depends upon factors which cannot be controlled by any producing/rz-&gt; *1 producing company for any given period upon a given basis. To attempt to give any assurance that any particular proportion of the oil produced in Bahrain will be refined in Bahrain for export abroad would bind the Company in the face of continually uncertain and changeable world-wide market conditions, to a fixed programme which might well fatally hamper the Company in the disposal of its production. It would limit the Company's freedom of action unnecessarily and inadvisedly in a way which would seriously impair, if not destroy, the chances of a successful enterprise. Upon the quantity of crude oil produced, depends the revenue, beyond the minimum royalty revenue, to be derived by His Excellency from the exploitation of his oil fields. It follows logically, therefore, that an assurance of the kind referred tolcould not be in the best interests i either of His Excellency or of the Company. Moreover, it is reasonable to suppose that the foregoing considerations, affecting as they do the direct interests of His Excellency, the Subjects of His Excellency and the Company, must have been borne in mind at the time the terms of the Concession Agreement were settled, terms which, whilst referring to the powers of the Company to refine oil, avoid sedulously any attempt to impose upon the lessee such a hampering restriction as an obligation to refine the crude product.

Lalthwaite, ^ ' Charting and Buoying , I refer to my tallc with you on Tuesday last the 17th instant and to th^letter of the Government of India P.Z.1778/34 The Company is of the opinion that the three second-hand second-olass conical shape dumb Buoys, including Moorings,referred to in paragraph 4 of the said letter of the Government of India, would 'be suitable for the purposes of the Company, and I am to ask that these should be supplied from Basrah. It is understood from paragraph 7 of the said letter (last sentence) that the work could be commenced without delay. There is, however, the question of the Light Buoy, which seems to be the key of the situation,and which does not appear to be available from reserve {paragraph 3 of the said letter). It is suggested by the Company that it might be possible for the Admiralty to lend the Company a Light Buoy during the time the Company takes to procure a Light Buoy of its own. Perhaps the Tender 'Kearchus' has one which it could let the Company have for a time? Would you be good enough to have an enquiry made of* the Admiralty, and let me know? I am instructed that the Company is qgreeable to the annual cost of maintaining four Buoys (including cost for Light Buoy) at 280 per annum. It is assumed that maitenance includes raising, **'' ^ chipping and re-painting the Buoys {see paragraph 6 of said letter) With regard to mooring the Buoys, I do not know whether it can be arranged to have the work of mooring fitted in with the tegular schedule of the Light Tender - this point is referred thwaite,Esq., ^ Office, Whitehall, S.W.I.

P.S.26^8/34 of trie aotii ..pril about lighting and buoying at Bahrein. The light buoy required by the company will need to be large and I understand that the dmiralty have none of sufficient size available and ths.u those they have would have to be reconaitioned before they were fit for service. Captain Edgell has suggested that th.re might be a Duoy of the right size available at Basrah as the Port Trust have several light buoys which they look after, and he thinks that it might be worth while to consult Colonel ward. The Admiralty do not know whether the NEAHCHU3 carries a spare. lb.e experts here tell me that the Gas Accumulator Gonpyny f Beacon works, Brentford, i.jldalesex, could p*obaaly produce a buoy to 1 it 'one company 1 s purpose very quickly. Another possibility is that Trinity House might have a spare buoy of suitable size; but the quickest solution would of course be that one should be sent from Basrah. Yours sincerely, H.H. POVJLL.

C OKB 1 1DEITTIAL . INDIA OFFICE . Note of conversation with Mr. Ballantyne on Tuesday , 17th A'pril . I had asked Mr. Ballantyne to call, so that I could inform him of the advice which was 'being given to the Sheikh on the Bahrein Petroleum Company's application to be allowed to use radio telephones, and explained that, as an adequate service operated by Imperial and International Communications Ltd. was already available, direct communication with San Francisco could not be permitted; that it would be necessary to maintain the three-mile limit, save to ihe extent that radio telephones might be used outside it between Sitra and the outer buoy to the extent specified in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Mr. Skinner's letter to the Political Agent, of 18th March, P.Z.39; that within the iif three-mile limit the Company might communicate with all tankers, whether or not belonging to or chartered by them, and that these two latter points would represent special concessions which we would expect the Company to bear in mind. 2. Mr. Ballantyne did not appear much concerned at the rejection of certain of the Company's demands, and was clearly satisfied with the approval which had been given to others. He mentioned in this connection that he hoped we should soon reach a point at which it wo u ld be unnecessary /j to emphasise that the various respects in which the Sheikh || was meeting them did in fact represent special concessions. The/*V The Company felt that they were actively developing their concession on the right lines and that a certain amount of give and take was necessary, and while he himself appreciated the Sheikh's point, a continual emphasis on the fact that a certain action represented a special concession on the part of the Sheikh tended to produce rather unfortunate reaction on his American principals. I said I trusted that we should soon have reached a point at w.ich the Company would have met us on our various outstanding desiderata and the necessity for emphasising these special concessions might 'be less great. 3' Refining . I referred to Mr. Ballantyne's letter of 16th April (copies circulated under P.Z.2543/34) and said that the Company did not appear to have made any very substantial advance to meet the Sheikh. I would communicate further with him on this subject after the advice of the expert technical authorities had been obtained. I might, however, say at this stage that, while their difficulties were no doubt real, it did seem very desirable tha-u they should if possible give the Sheikh some indication that in certain circumstances (they could safeguard the position as much as they wished) they would be prepared to consider local refining. Mr. Ballantyae replied that he was advised that their difficulties in going substantially beyond what was said in his letter to me were very great. They did not really yet quite know where they stood. yv r hile the results from certain bore-holes were available, it might well oe that deeper boring would lead to a modification of them and it was much too early yet for them to commit themselves on a question such as this.&amp; •JrJ 3. 4 • Acquisition of land o n Sitra, etc. Mr.Ballantyne said that the Ccmpe,ny much appreciated the Sheikh's granting of their requests under this head, though they had rather felt that they were entitled to » his co-operation in the matter, as it was to the interest of 'both parties tha,t the concession should 'be developed as rapidly as possible. 5. Checking of returns and method of measuring oil f or royalty. Mr.Ballantyne said that he understood that some further discussion had taken place on this subject between Colonel Loch and Mr.Skinner since the date of my letter to him of March, and that the Bahrein Government were now contemplating the maintenance of a whole-time inspector. He premised a letter on the question generally which would set out the position. 6. Amendments to Mining Lease. The Company were now in a position to let us have a reply on this point, which would incidentally cover the important question of ccmmercial exploitable quantity. A letter would reach us in the next couple of days. . Training of Bahreinis, etc. He had put the suggestion made to him at an earlier stage on this point to the Company, who were considering it sympathetically. He hoped in due course to let us know the result. 8- Lighting and Buoying. Mr.Ballantyne had now received instructions from the Company and a letter would follow. They were of opinion that the three secondhand second class dumb buoys referred to in paragraph 4 of.the Government of India's express letter of 6th March, P.17- 33 (copies circulated under P.Z.1778/34 of 20th March) would meet the Company's needs&gt; The rea,l difficulty was the provision of the light buoy. The Government of India/4. India had indicated in the letter in question that they had no light huoy or light float available. They had also emphasised that the completion of the whole scheme would depend on the date of the fixing of the light buoy. Could we assist in any way ? I said that if he would raise the matter in writing I would consult the Admiralty and see if they could help. Mr.Ballantyne expressed appreciation and added that no difficulty would arise on the expenditure as estimated in the Government of India's canmunicati ons. Appointment and position of Company's mooring master . Mr.Ballantyne did not appear to have had previous information as to the appointment of a Mooring Master, reported in the Resident's despatch C/158 of 1st April, though he was aware that the Company were maintaining a harbourmaster. I said that it would, of course, be necessary that the consent of the Bahrein Government, who already had a port officer, should be obtained to this appointment , and that the mooring master and pilot would have to be subject to the authority of the Bahrein Government's port officer. I gathered that Mr.Ballantyne saw no difficulty on this point. J.G. LAITHWAITE, 20th April 1934.4^ H 0 INDIA OFFICEs WHITEH/iLLj S.W.I. iD p.z. 2565/34. 21st April 1934. Dear Mr. Ballantyne, I write to confirm our conversation of two or three days ago aTaout the Bahrein radio-telephones, to say that the Sheikh has been advised to reply to the request put forward on 'behalf of the Company; (a) that as an adequate service operated by Imperial and International Communications Ltd. is already available, direct communication with San Francisco'cannot be permitted. (b) that he is unable to relax the three mile limit imposed last January, save to the extent that the Mooring Master at Sitra may use radio-telephones between Sitra and the outer buoy (within the area recently surveyed on behalf of the Company by H.M.S. 'Ormonde' which includes the track which will be used by incoming ships) to the extent specified in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Mr. Skinner's letter to the Political lH V Agent, P.A.39 dated 18th March. I i T v (c) that within the three mile limit the Company may, however, communicate with all tankers coming in to remove the Company's oil products, whether or not belonging to or chartered by them. 2. As I mentioned to you, it will, of course, be necessary to obtain the consent of the Bahrein Government to the appointment of a Mooring Master and Pilot, which was referred to in Mr. Skinner's letter quoted above, and the Mooring Master and Pilot would of course also have to be subject to the authority of the Bahrein Government's Port Officer.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, Modification of Mining Lease. / I have to refer to 3/our letter P.Z, 7189/33 of the 11th November 1933 and the enclosed Schedule of amendments proposed to the Mining Lease. As a result of the consideration of these amendments, it has occurred to the Company that there are a few further emendations which might as well be brought forward to bring the Mining Lease into closer conformity with ordinary oil-field practice and to take the course suggested by you in paragraph 3 of your letter under reply, the Company has set out the modifications of the Mining Lease in a form which it thinks should be acceptable to all parties concerned. The Company has had prepared a composite document comprised of the original Schedule III to the Concession Agreement of 2nd December 1925, as modified by subsequent documents. Six prints of this composite form are enclosed herewith for your convenience. One of such forms shows the modifications I have referred to above. In sending you these modifications I think I should, as a lawyer, add that I do so without prejudice to the right of the Company to take up the Lease in the form provided by Schedule III to the Conceesion Agreement. I have no doubt that modifications will ultimately be/tf be made to the Lease agreeable to everyone concerned but until that time arrives the Company should, I think, reserve its right to admit, in principle, the alteration of its Concession Agreement only by way of mutual arrangement. I should add that there are quite a number of alterations of a verbal character which require to be made. These are apparent from a perusal of the form: for example, there are references to 'Agreement 1 ' instead of to 'Lease 4 ', the 'Political Agent' might be formally referred to and there are a few unwanted capital letters and punctuation marks.

HOW GERMAN GRANTS FOR DRILLING WILL BE MADE. OIL CONFERENCES. For some weeks past the Press of America and of this country has contained numerous references to forthcoming- oil conferences. Colour has been given to these statements by the arrival in London of several notable American oil men and by the knowledge that others are on the way here. It may be said at once that anything in the nature of a formal oil conference is not intended and is out of the question. However, a number of urgent problems have to be faced in the near future by the large oil organisations; and a number of new developments have to be anticipated and arranged for. In the former category may be placed the present position and outlook in the United States, together with its effect upon the petrol market. If there is any current question concerning which it is desirable to have a common international programme it is certainly this. In the second category may be placed the rapid approach of deliveries through the French branch of the Iraq pipe line, to be followed shortly afterwards by deliveries through the other branch, which terminates at Haifa; and further, the definite proving up of Bahrein Island as an oil field. There can be no comparison as to the world importance of these sources of supply. Iraq can produce quantities which must influence the world market unless they are—as they will be—arranged for by international agreement. Bahrein Island, compared with Iraq, will only produce small quan tities; but TTie 'disp osal of its oITcan be a disturbin g factor if arraj^ejments are not made tor its absorption. .Enough has been said to convince any intelligent person that, in view of these pending matters, there will be important meet ings of oil men from various countries in the very near future. DEEP WELLS. It is no new reflection that at a time when there is more oil in sight than the world needs the facilities for getting still more oil should be increased. Part of these facilities, of course, consists in the new oil fields which are being discovered in various parts of the world ; part of these facilities consists in the ability to drill more rapidly and to greater depths than ever before. Nor is it only deep drill ing, in itself, that is so important. It is the ability to drill the hole straight, to any depth up to 10,000 ft. or more, and to keep the hole straight during drilling, which is accom plished by the aid of highly ingenious and efficient devices, in this connection Captain Bruges' paper before the Tech nologists this week is of special interest because it deals with the surveying of deep boreholes in Burma, where neither the drilling nor the surveying is particularly easy to accomplish with accuracy. True, no Burma well has yet been drilled to 10,000 ft. or near it; but the method of sur vey described by Captain Bruges is applicable to any reasonable depth. Elsewhere in this issue part of the paper is reproduced and will give the reader a good idea of the scope of the system and method used by Captain Bruges. Welded Casing. Improvements in equipment and material for drilling deep wells play a large part in bringing these wells to the desired depth. One of the latest developments is to weld the lengths of casing together instead of screwing them in the time-honoured manner. An account, which appears in this issue of ' Oil News,' tells how over 5,000 ft. of casing was welded length to length and lowered into a well within a few hours. The size of this casing, 16-in. outside diameter, is a remarkable feature of this achievement because the total weight of it is in the neighbourhood of 200 tons. The landing of such a long string of large diameter casing would only be undertaken, of course, if it were intended to drill to a much greater depth. The re markable thing to those not very familiar with the use of welded casing is that, should it be necessary to pull the casing from the particular borehole referred to, that could be done, and the casing ' unwelded,' so to speak, with almost as great rapidity as it was welded and lowered. Recent Deep Boreholes. A number of wells recently drilled or now being drilled are worthy of attention in respect of depth. We have already announced the finding of oil at 9,900 ft. in the deepest test in Oklahoma. Particulars of this'appeared in ' Oil News ' of'March 15. Readers are also familiar with a well in the Kettleman North Dome of California which has reached 10,300 ft. At one time this was the deepest well actively drilling in the world ; but it has now given place to a well of the General Petroleum Corporation, in the Sputh Belridge district of California, which at latest advices had reached 10,602 ft. It is remarkable that this well is surrounded by a number of shallow wells, and that it was drilled with the object of reaching a deep zone penetrated in North Belridge at less than 6,000 ft. That depth was passed in the South Belridge well without any indication of the formation looked for; and the well was suspended for an interval. When work was resumed it was believed that the drill was not far from this zone; and deepening operations have con tinued steadily. So far as the company has taken the public into its confidence the objective for which the well was drilled has not yet been reached. And to recur for a moment to the deep Oklahoma well we may mention this fact with regard to it : that, according to mail advices, people who are supposed to know believe that it may make eventually 3,000 to 4,000 barrels a day, if not more. PETROLEUM ACT: A FIASCO. The Petroleum Act (1918) was passed with the object of encouraging drilling for oil in this country. It was endorsed by the Petroleum Department of that time. It has proved a fiasco. Those of us connected with the industry have been we 1 aware of that fact for years. Further intimation of it reac ed the intelligent public when the new Bill disclosed at under the Act only three licences to drill were outstand- ing. A statement by the Secretary for Mines is to thethe bahrein petroleum company limited B ahrein I sland, P ersian G ulf, v May 10, 1934. No. PA-76 His Britannic Majesty»s Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear Sir: I am instructed by my Company to request that you advise His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin *Isa ill Khalifah, of the following formulated for the measurement of oil for royalty purposes. The Company is now erecting the following tanks:- (a) Three tanks on Sitra Island, two haring a capacity of about 85,000 barrels each and one haring a capacity of about 80,000 barrels, all for the storage and shipment of oil. (b) A further tank on Sitra Island, being a Mlge water (so-called) tank having a capacity of about 7,500 barrels, and (c) Four tanks on the main Bahrein Island near to the ex perimental topping plant there, each of such tanks having a capacity of about 500 barrels. The unit 'barrel', as used in every case in this letter, com prises 42 U.S. gallons. The crude oil, as produced, will be flowed into tanks in the vicinity of the wells and thence through the gathering system to the oil tanks at Sitra and, when occasion demands, the topping plant tanks. The Company contemplates paying royalty on the net crude oil run from 'the Sitra and topping plant tanks. Royalty-free oil for the Company*s operations is, of course, excepted from the foregoing. (to the question of His Excellency the Shaikh having some meansIof checking the quantities concerned, he will be especially interested in the calibration of the Sitra and topping plant tanks. The Company is prepared to have these tanks measured by expert personnel now in Bahrein but if His Excellency would prefer to have the work done by Messrs. B. and R. Redwood, which the Company understands is a leading British firm with considerable experience in various parts of the World, the Company is prepared to engage that firm for the work. As the work must be under taken without delay, perhaps His Excellency would be good enough to let the Company know now whether the foregoing proposal to employ Messrs. B. and R. Redwood is one he would like the Company to give effect to. b It is proposed to have the tanks calibrated by outside measurements and to have tank tables prepared in barrels. The rolume of oil run from these tanks will be measured by the use of an accurate steel tape. Samples will be taken from the tanks at different levels - ordinarily the top, middle and bottom - and will be mixed in equal proportions prior to the gravity determination of the oil. The gravity of the oil will be ascer tained at any convenient temperature by the use of an American Petroleum Institute gravity hydrometer and as so ascertained will be converted to specific gravity, referred to water at 60 degrees, l^ahrenheit. The temperature of the samples tested will be taken immediately upon withdrawal from the tank by means of an accurate Fahrenheit thermometer, in order to obtain one of the necessary factors for correcting the measured volume of oil to what it would be at 50 degrees, Fahrenheit. This will be done by the use of tables published in Circular 154 of the United States Bureau of Standards. The same Circular contains tables for converting the volume in barrels into English tons which will be done for the purpose of the royalty computations.- 3 - ' In order to determine the amount of water and foreign substances for allowable deductions in royalty calculations, the Company proposes to use the most generally adopted method, namely, that known as the Centrifuge Method. 0^ . Another consideration which will have some bearing on the question \ of royalty payments is the submarine loading line no?/ being installed by I the Company. The Company also proposes usually to keep oil in this line, rather than to displace the oil with salt water after each run from the tanks. In measuring oil run from the Sitra tanks for royalty purposes, it will not be necessary, therefore, to make allowance for the amount of oil in the submarine line, except, of course, on those occasions when the oil may be displaced from the line for some particular reason. It might be mentioned here that the Company expects to equip the submarine line with an automatic suction pump or pumps, ^ I should add that in proposing the methods outlined above, the Company has been guided by the consideration of what are not only accurate but also practicable and relatively simple methods, if His Excellency will, no doubt, avail himself of his privilege to have the oil accounts verified for royalty purposes. In this connection I am directed to say that if His Excellency would care to exercise his right under the Concession of appointing a representative to verify the oil measurements and accounts in connection with royalty payments, tne Company would welcome such appointment. IYI am further advised that a letter, practically identical with this one, was presented to the India Office on May 7, 19o4.If any of these points are not entirely clear, I shalX of course be pleased to discuss them with you at your conTenience Yours very truly, Chief Local Representative, THE BAHREIN: PETROLEUM COMPANY, LIMITED.CONFIDENTIAL. no.

Dear Sir: I have to refer to your letter No. C/^XlO/l.YII dated the 15th April 1934, referring to the installation of a private telephone line between Jebel Dukhan and Manama. As mentioned in our conversation of April 19th, the Company has already been granted the right to construct telephone lines. That right exists under the Concession not only in the Second Schedule but in the Third Schedule as well. The first sentence of paragraph II of the Second Schedule, under which the Company is now working, reads: 'The right to carry out in any part of the said territory such work as may be necessary for the purpose of prospecting.' A telephone line is ordinarily one of the first installations made in connection with the drilling of a prospect well or wells. When our prospecting operations have reached such a stage that « telephone commu nication between the scene of actual operations and the port of Manama where the materials are landed and the Manager resides will increase the efficiency and economy with which they can be carried on, such an installation becomes clearly 'necessary for the purpose of prospecting.' The condition mentioned under subparagraph (a) and the first condition in subparagraph (b) of your letter will, of course, be complied with. Referring to the second condition of subparagraph (b): We shall, of course, be pleased to grant the Bahrein Government way-leave to run a line of their own on the Company's posts should they desire to do so. Because of the rather great cost of the Company's installation it is assumed that some compensation would be returned for such grant, possibly in the form of a preferential exchange rate at Manama, or a set figure to be paid but of a prescribed portion of our exchange bills.

BALLANTTNE, BAiffiAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY, REGARDING APPOINTMENT OP CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE, ON END MAY, 1934. \c\^ {y&gt; The concurrence ol the interested Departiiients having been olDtained in action on the lines suggested in the Political Resident's express letter of 8th April, NofG,193, I asked Mr, Ballantyne to call to discuss the position in regard to the Chief-Local Representative. 2. I said to Mr, Ballantyne that as he probatly have inferred from previous informal discussions on this subject we had ourselves, subject to any reports we should receive from the Gulf been rather inclined to think that the best solution might be as a special case, and with the proviso that in our view the Chief Local Representative ought normally to be a British subject, to confirm Mr. Skinner, but to require that the acting vacancy created by Mr. Skinner's forthcoming long leave should be filled by a British subject. The Political Resident had subsequently intimated that the Sheikh expressed a definite preference for a British subject, and after further personal discussion of the matter with His Excellency had now informed us that the Sheikh held to his view, which was shared by the remainder of the ruling family. The Resident had added that while Mr. Skinner was personally acceptable, it would clearly be most impolitic to force an American on the Sheikh and would have an unfortunate effect on local public opinion. He had suggested in these circumstances thau lir. Russell of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation might be employed. Arrangements could as a special case, and by way of meeting the Company, be made for the Political Agent to discuss matters direct with the Fields/Fields Manager whenever lie thought fit 5 if Mr. Russell was appointed. difficulty was likely to arise over the confirmation of Mr. Skinner. He could not, of course, commit the Company, but prima fa cie he was not attracted 'by the proposal to employ Mr. Russell, It would 'be unsatisfactory from the Company's point of view to have a non-expert concerned with their business. Moreover, he had no information as to Mr. Russell's standing and as to whether he would be acceptable to the Bahrein authorities. 4. I said that it might be assumed that the Resident had satisfied himself as to Mr. Russell before suggesting him. At the same time we appreciated the objections taken by Mr. Ballantyne, and the suggestion had been made with a view only to assisting the Company. The real solution was a British Chief Local Representative» If the Company ?/ould meet us over this they need not anticipate any difficulty in securing our concurrence in the Chief Local Representative doubling the duties of that post with those of some other post in the Company's organisation in Bahrein. 5. After considerable further discussion Mr. Ballantyne said that on the assumption (which I confirmed) that we were not prepared to dispense with the post of Chief Local Representative, he would at once report the position uo the Company who would immediately consider his replacement, that he,had .been under the impression th§it Mr. Skinner's leave was for six and not for twelve months (Bushire demi oifa-ci^l letter C/l34 dated E8th March 19S4); that Mr. Skinner, so far Mr. Ballantyne expressed great regret that as/0 n as he was aware ? was not; due 'bo leave Bahrein un'til July which would give two months in which to consider matters; that the Company might,, if we saw no objection,, possibly not find themselves in a position to suggest any replacement for Mr. Skinner for two or perhaps three months after he left Bahrein; and that during the period of his leave they might suggest trying out one or two British subjects in the acting post of Chief Local Representative. He appreciated the importance of finding suitable British subjects, and it would clearly 'be necessary to get a man of the right type and in particular someone who would keep out of politics. A post could perhaps be found for him in the Company's organisation at Bahrein as Labour Master or the like. 6, I said that the Company were entitled under their Agreement to a reasonable delay in filling the post oi Chief Local Representative though they would of course have two months between now and the date of Mr. Skinner's departure on leave: and that we would understand it in the circumstances if there was a slight gap between Mr. Skinner's departure on leave and the appointment of a successor. Three montns ? however ? would be our outside limit. As he would lemembei from our discussions over Major Holmes, we had never contemplated that there should be a gap in the appointment longer than two or three months in the year at the ouuside. 7. Mr. Ballantyne left me with the impression uhab while the refusal to confirm Mr. Skinner would come as a shock to the Company who might not take it well, there was reason to hope that they would not be obstructive about arranging for his ultimate replaceme nt by a British subject (possibly with a Briti sh/(3 4.

Burgess, Director supplement to circular no. 154 [Issued October 27, 1931] abridged volume correction table for petroleum oils [Approved by The American Petroleum Institute, The American Society for Testing Materials, The Bureau of Mines, and The Bureau of Standards. For complete table, see Table 2, Circular No. 154] The table contained herein has been prepared to meet a demand from the oil industry for a short and convenient table for reducing oil volumes to the basis of 60° F. when extreme accuracy is not required. It is not intended to replace the more complete and accu rate volume correction table contained in Circular No. 154, but rather to supplement it and especially to replace the various abridged tables and approximate correction factors heretofore employed in the oil industry. In case high accuracy is essential the complete table contained in Circular No. 154 should be used, especially if large volumes or wide temperature ranges are involved. To avoid possible confusion all contracts should state which table is to be used. The abridged table is based on the same data as Table 2, Circular No. 154. The groups, coefficients of expansion, degrees A. P. I., and gravity ranges of the abridged table follow: Group number Coeffi cient of expan sion at 60° F. Corre sponding degrees A. P .I. Range of group (degrees A. P. I. at 60° F.) I 0. 0004 22 Tip to 34.9. 35 to 50.9. II .0005 44 mi .0006 58 51 to 63.9. IV - - .0007 72 64 to 78.9. V . 0008 86 79 to 88.9. VI .00085 91 89 and higher. 1 Motor fuels containing benzol may be arbitrarily placed in Group III without serious error. Their expansion coefficients are higher than for straight run petroleum oils of equivalent specific gravity. (See B. S. Journ. Research (IIP393), vol. 7; December, 1931.) This table shows the volume occupied at 60° F. by a quantity of oil occupying unit volume at the indicated temperatures. For example, if at 60° F. the degrees A. P. I. of the oil is 28 (Group I), 1 gallon of this oil measured at 120° F. will have a volume of 0.9763 gallon at 60° F. The values given in the table are in the form of 'multipliers'; that is, the volume of oil at the indicated tempera ture and degrees A. P. I. for each group, multiplied by the corre sponding factor in the table, equals the volume at 60° F. For ex ample, if the degrees A. P. I. of an oil at 60° F. equals 28 (Group I) and the volume at 120° F. equals 6,000 gallons, then the volume at 60° F. equals 6,000 X 0.9763, or 5,857.8 gallons. 83706°—31P.Z. 5/W; INDIA OFFICE, LONDON. rr Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

P.2. £ 8th May 1934 Dear Mr.Ballantyne, Many thanks for your letter of the 7th May on the subject of a permanent Chief Local Representative at Bahrein. S. As I explained to you, the Political Resident informed us recently that the Sheikh had expressed a definite preference for the appointment of a British subject as Chief Local Representative and subsequently reported, after personal discussion of the matter mth His Excellency, that the Sheikh held to his view, which was shared by the remainder of the Ruling Family. The Resident, after consultation with the Political Agent, Bahrein, suggested that in these circumstances a possible course might be the appointment of a British subject from some local firm to fill the post and dicated that in their view Mr.Russell, the Bahrein Manager ^ of the Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, who are already landing agents for the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, would b e suitable. Arrangements could as a special case be made xor the Political Agent to discuss matters direct with the Field Manager in the event of Mr.Russell's appointment. 3. Apart from the fact that in the opinion of His Majesty's Government it is desirable, in view of their special relations with the Sheikh, that the appointment of a Chief Local Representative or Acting Chief Local Representative should normally be filled by a British subject, it would clearly be most undesirable to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh in a matter such as this and would have an unfortunate effect on local public opinion, and His Majesty's Government trust/ Ballantyne Esq..

It would seem, from a letter received by Mr. Hamilton from ir.Skianer yesterday afternoon, that it may not be necessary to fceep the 'El Segundo' in Bahrain beyond the 15th June. Extracted entirely, the letter reads thus:- 'Mr. Deaoon 1 s work is progressing so well that he now thinks he will be able to release the''El Segundo' between June 10th and 15th. In order to do this, it will be necessary for EO men (including Beacon and his Engineers)to live in our Gamp for about 30 days. One of these men will be Captain Nelson and four of the others are already at our camp. I nave approached Captain Loon on this subject and he sees no objection to the men living here providing they have the proper visas. All of them have passports and can secure visas from Colonel Loch. Alt no our Camp will be a little crowded and we will have to have two sittings for meals,we have no objection whatever to Deaoon and his men staying here. In fact, I rather favor it as the men will have the opportunity of going home through Europe as a reward for the good 30b they have done in the short time they will have been here.' I believe there have been no complaints about these men end it is hoped that with the Political Agent in agreement, as apparently he is from Mr, Skinner's letter, there will be no objection to the men living ashore for the short time contemplated.

Their main office is at Tokyo, but they have an office at Yokohama. The firm is a big Japanese merchant concern similar to the Mitsui and Mitubishi, and has various engineering and other interests. It has no oil refinery, however, and, as a matter of fact, does not deal directly with oil, but it has been known to act as brokers for some of the Californian oil companies. It is possible that, in the present case, it is acting as the agent of the Standard Oil Company of California and will arrange for these five barrels of oil, which form what is known in the trade as a 'bulk sample', to be tested with a view to ascertaining the possibilities inherent in the Bahrein crude oil. This rather looks as if the Standard Oil Company of California is in touch with some Japanese oil company as a possible purchaser. If such is the case, the company would have to be capable of refining the crude oil. The three principal refining companies in Japan are the Nippon Oil Company, the Ogura Oil Company, and the Mitubishi Oil Company, the last named being a joint the Associated It appears that the Company to which the oil Oil/2.

THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED. 19, MOORGATE, LONDON, E.G. 2, 7th May 1934. Dear Mr.Laithwaite, p. I have to reply to your letter P.Z.1818/34, of the 80th March on the subject matter of measurement of oil for royalty purposes and where the measuring tanks are to he set. ^ The Company is now erecting four tanks on Sitra Island, two having a capacity of about 85,000 barrels each, one having a capacity of about 80,000 barrels (all for the storage and shipment of oil) and a fourth tank (being a bilge water tank) having a capacity of about 7,500 barrels. It is also erecting four tanks on the main Bahrein Island near to the experimental topping plant there, each of such tanks having a capacity of about 500 barrels. The unit 'barrel', as ?used in every case in this letter, comprises 42 U .S. gallons. The crude oil, as produced, will be flowed into tanks in the vicinity of the wells and thence through trie gathering system to the oil tanks at Sitra and, when occat-ion demands, to the topping plant tanks. The Company contemplaves paying royalty on the net crude oil run from the Sitra and topping plant tanks. Royalty-free oil for the Company s operations is, of course, excepted from the foregoing. On the question of His Excellency the Shaikh having some means of checking the quantities concerned, he will be especially/ ■' ^ithwaite Esq., nia office, ^itehall, S.W.I.especially interested in the calibration of the Sitra and topping plant tanks. The Company is prepared to have these tanks measured 'by expert personnel now in Bahrain 'but if His Excellency would prefer to have the work done hy Messrs»B»and R .Redwood, which the Company understands is a leading British firm with considerable experience in various parts of the World, the Company is prepared to engage that firm for the work.. As the work must he undertaken without delay, perhaps His Excellency would he good enough to let the Company know now whether the foregoing proposal to employ Messrs.B. and R. Redwood is one he would like the Company to give effect.to. yIt is proposed to have the tanks calibrated by outside measurements and to have tank tables prepared in barrels. The volume of oil run from these tanks will be measured by the use of an accurate steel tape. Samples will be taken from the tanks at different levels - ordinarily the top, middle and bottom - and will be mixed in equal proportions prior to the gravity determination of the oil. The gravity of the oil will be ascertained at an^ convenient temperature by the use of an American Petroleum Institute gravity hydrometer and as so ascertained will be converted to specific gravity, referred to water at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature of the samples tested will be taken immediately upon withdrawal from the tank by means of an accurate Fahrenheit thermometer, in order to obtain one of th necessary factors for correcting the measured volume of to what it would be at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. This will be done by the use of tables published in Circular 154 of the United States Bureau of Standards. The same Circular contains tables for converting the volume in barrels which will be done for the purpose ot the royalty computations. In/tylLc 10? j' In order to determine the amount of water and foreign suistanoes for allowable deductions in royalty calculations, the Company proposes to use the most generally adopted method, namely» that known as the Centrifuge Method* &lt;1 Another consideration which will have some bearing on the question oi royalty payments is the submarine loading line now 'being installed 'by the Company* The Company also proposes usually to keep oil in this line» rather than to displace the oil with salt water after each run from the tanks♦ In measuring oil run from the Sitra tanks for royalty purposes, it will not he necessary, therefore, to make allowance for the amount of oil in the submarine line, except, of course, on those occasions when the oil may 'be displaced from the line for some particular reason. It might be mentioned here that the Company expects to equip the submarine line with an automatic suction pump or pumps* I should add that in proposing the methods outlined above, the Company has been guided by the consideration of what are not only accurate but also practicable and relatively simple methods. His Excellency will, no doubt, avail himself of his privilege to have the oil accounts verified for royalty purposes. In this connection I am directed to say that if His Excellency would care to exercise his right under the Concession of appointing a Representative to verity the oil measurements and accounts in connection with royalty payments, the Company 'would welcome such appointment. If there is any further information you want you have, of course, only to let me know. A letter following the terms of this one will be written by the Company through its Chief Local Representative to Excellency in the course of a few days. \ Yours, &amp;c., . (Sgd.) H.R. BALLANTYNE.Csi GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. &lt; ^£&lt;mu IJocAy cf/f34. In reference 'to the Oil—tanks recently erected at Sitrah by The Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., the State Engineer has very kindly pointed out to me the desirability of ascertaining the dimensions and volume of these tanks, for guaging purposes, and he urges the importance of this in view of the changes of temperature locally, and also the necessity for calibrated and tested charts, for the purpose of ascertaining accurately the quantities of oil to be exported from Bahrain via the pipe-line into the Tank-ship. I understandift that to ascertain this accurately will require some technical experience in addition to involved mathematical calculations, and that an error is likely to involve the Government of Bahrain in some loss of royalty. Also, in view of the local danger involved in the storing of large quantities of oil, the State Engineer has kindly suggested the consideration of Fuel Oil Regulations similar to those obtaining in India. I have no doubt that the above points have already been taken into consideration by Yourself; and I would therefore venture to enquire if this is a suitable moment for any steps to be taken in this connection, please.

The First Lord of the Admiralty was asked in the House of Commons last week whether, in view of the limited supplies of oil fuel in the British Empire^and the dependence of the Royal Navy upon oil fuel, he was consulted before an American company was permitted to acquire and operate an oil concession in the British territory of the Bahrein Islands. Sir B. Eyres Monsell replied that Bahrein is not British territory. The Sheikh of Bahrein is an independent ruler in special treaty relationships with the British Government which precluded the grant of an oil concession save with their approval. The Admiralty were consulted before the concession in question was acquired by the American company, and were satisfied that the conditions attached to its acquisition were the best that could be obtained. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was also asked at a later date whether British interests were consulted before the oil concession in the Bahrein Islands was permitted to be acquired by an American company, and why, in view of the special relationships which exist between the British Government and the Government of those islands, no steps were taken to obtain such concession for Great Britain. Sir John Simon replied that the Bahrein oil concession was originally acquired by a British syndicate and was subsequently transferred to United States interests by it. The British syndicate who first acquired the concession had stated that before it transferred it to United States interests it endeavoured unsuccessfully to attract possible British concessionaires.S/u INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

My dear Laithwaite, ^ , ^1° J I have your letter of the 8th instant regarding the measurement of oil for royalty purposes at Bahrein, and confirm that the calibration arrangements referred to in Ballantyne' s letter of the 7th May are the result of an informal talk which I had with Hamilton on behalf of the Bahrein Pe t r o 1 eun [c ompany. I agree that the arrangements proposed may 'be regarded as generally satisfactory. With regard to the calibration of the Sitra and topping plant tanks referred to in paragraph 5 of Ballantyne's letter, I think the work should 'b e done by an independent person as the ascertainment of the | ~. quantities of oil shipped or refined, and therefore the amount of royalty to be paid, will depend entirely on the calibration of these tanks and there should be no doubt or suspicion as to the correctness of the measurements and calculations made now^ Messrs.B.&amp; R. Redwood, who are mentioned by Mr.Ballantyne, are a well-known firm who have done considerable work for the Admiralty in the past, and A'e can say that they are a quite reputable firm. With reference to the proposals made in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, I think these maybe agreed to, subject to the concurrence of the independent person who takes on the work. I believe, as a matter of fact, that Hamilton has already discussed these points with Redwoods and has secured their IWthwaUe Esa., informal/ ftitehall, S.W.I,2. informal agreement. In i egai d. to j.^aragi'aph. 9j respecting the submarine loading line, I think we may safely agree to the Company keeping the line full of oil rather than of salt water. This is quite a general practice and retards to some extent the rapid erosion of the pipeline which takes place in trot&gt;ical waters. One other point was raised 'by Hamilton when he saw me, and that was what arrangements the Gomoany might he reouired to make for disposal of ballast water from tanks arriving in ballast. This water is often very dirty and contaminated with oil. In this country tankers are required to discharge this 'ballast water a considerable distance out at sea. This is a point which ought not to be lost sight of, as the discharge of dirty ballast near the coast of Bahrein might be detrimental to the pearl fisheries. Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) P.O. STARLING.

Mr. Ballantyne asked for an interview to discuss arrangements in regard to lighting and buoying and the calibration of tanks at Bahrein. 2. As regards lighting and buoyiiy he said that the Company appreciated the great assistance which had been given them by the Indian autnorities ana did not wish to press the matter unauly. But it was most Important from their point of view to know with the minimum of delay the position in regard to the light buoy, which was the key of the present position, and they would be grateful therefore if a further reminder could be sent at their expense. I said this would be a one. 3, Calibration, etc . Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company 's reply to our enquiry on this subject had, he hoped, made the position clear. They were anxious to know as soon as possible where they stood, because it would be necessary, if there was unlikely to be any nitch, to send out instruments, etc. to Bahrein in the near future lor use in connection with the checking of the measurements of the tanks. I said that the petroleum Department had had no very material criticism to make of the arrangembnts suggested in his letter and that a telegram had been sent to the Political Resident (repeated to Bahrein) on 15th fe,y that the comments of tne Petroleum Department on the arrangements proposed by the Company would follow oy the air mail of 18th K^ay. Mr. Ballantyne said that this information/lif-f '' - 2 information as 'to ths action which haci bysn t&amp;Ken in the matter wouia he of value to the Company and was all that they wanted to know for the moment. 4. Mining Lease desiderata . I informed Mr. Ballantyne that we hoped to he in a position to aiscuss next week the Company's reply on the question of our Mining Lease desiderata. I had not yet received the comments of the Petroleum Department, hut might perhaps mention that one of the most important points on which our requirements were unsatisfied appeared to he that of commercial exploitable Quantity. He was aware of the importance attached to this point hy the sheikh. 5- Mr. Ballantyne sale that he thought the Company had gone a long way to meet any reasonable demands on this question in their reply regarding the Sheikh's Mining Lease desiderata and that if they started production without further delay that was all that he could reasonably require. I said that I did not think that that was the case and that, while any remarks I might make must be the regarded as wholly provisional pending receipt of/advice of the Petroleum Department, I doubted if the advance represented by the amended Lease would really meet the Sheikh's point. It was quite true that tne sheikh, under the amended Lease woula be entitled to a minimum royalty of Rs.30,000 throughout. But Mr. Ballantyne would agree that that figure had been granted by the Company as consideration for an extension of the prospecting licence and was something quite separate from the payments which the sheikh might expect to receive under tne Mining Lease. The original Lease had contemplated a not unimportant ^crease in minimum, royalty payments on the Mining Lease being/being taken out, and the Sheikh, now ttiat the minimum payment during the interim period was fixed at Rs.30,000, might reasonably expect some advance on that figure on the Mining Lease coming into operation. Tiie figures which I suggested to him in one of our earlier interviews had been a minimum annual payment on the basis of, say, Rs.30,000 for the first two years, Rs.60,000 for the next three years 5 and Rs.100,000 thereafter, ^ • hir.Ballantyne said he could not see what justification there was for the making of a substantially higher payment to the Sheikh on the Mining Lease coming into operation. I replied that we understood that the Company were proposing to proauce at the rate of 5,000 barrels a aay from June or July of this year. If, in fact, they were to produce on a substantial scale, then, speaking personally, I was quite prepared to agree that the Sheikh might have no very strong claim to a higner minimum rate of royalty, since the royalties which he woula receive consequent on such substantial production would be sufficiently considerable to safeguard his interests. But the contingency which should not be overlooked (regarding the matter from the point of view of the sheikh) was the possibility of the Company, for whatever reason, ceasing to produce on a really substantial scale. (Mr. Ballantyne interjected that there was no risk, so far as he was aware, of the Company using Bahrein as a reserve oil field). It clearly would be of great importance to the Sheikh to safeguard himself against the risk of this by securing a fairly substantial minimum royalty. If, on the other hand, the Company had no intention of reducing production/pro auction, then equally they ran no risk in agreeing to niinimum royalty figures oi the d mens ions which I haa suggested. 8. Mr. Ballantyne saia that it was, of course, the case that if the hottom fell out of the oil market altogether ana it was impossible for the Company to dispose of more than a certain minimum amount of oil, the royalties woula fall. That equally was a consideration from their point of view in agreeing to any sucstantial minimum royalty. They might find themselves committed to a minimum royalty of a very substantial nature in respect of an oilfield which haa ceased to pay them. 9. I said that it was just for that reason that it was desirable to safeguara the Sheikh's interests. We had no complaint to make of our aealings with the Company, which had been amicable on both sides, or of the attitude which the Company had adopted in relation to oil questions. Looking at the matter broadly, it appeared to us that there was not much in it from the point of view of the Company. They were already liable for a minimum royalty of Hs.30,000; the maximum royalty which haa been suggested to him at an earlier date was 5s.1 lakh after a number of years. The difference was at the maximum Hs.70,000, say £5,000. That, for a company of the standing of the Bahrein petroleum Company, was not a very substantial risk. On the other hand, for someone like the Sheikh of Bahrein it dia present a quite substantial safeguard. 10. jvir, Ballantyne replied that the Company must consider its own interests and that the more he saw of this particular question the more he was impressed by the way in which thousands mounted up. At the same time he recognised the force of the argumenW Mb? ais# rfec^-ghl'sed that/5 that anything that was now saia to him was purely provisional in character, 'but if on receipt of the advice of the expert Department we raised the point on the lines on which it had just been pressed on him, clearly the Company would have to consider it further. He wished to emphasise, however, that the Lease did impose a definite burden on the Company. The rate of royalty was very highi one point considered in connection with the Mining Lease desiderata had heen whether the Company should not demand a revision aownwards in the rate of the royalty after a period of, say, 5 years, or if circumstances changed. I said that we were advised that the rate of royalty, though generous, was 'by no means excessive and that it would he unwise to hold out hope to him of the prohahility of any revision. 11. It was agreed that the matter should he discussed further on receipt of the advice of the Petroleum Department. J, G.

Following an inter-departmental meeting held at the India Office on c/th Septemoer, 1933, to consider a memorandum by uhe Petroleum Department and discuss the proposed amendments, a schedule cf proposed amendments was sent to Kr. Ballantyne with a letter from the India Office dated 11th November, 1933. fhe Company has made an attempt to deal 'with each of the points mentioned in the schedule, and the extent to which the effort is regarded as satisfactory is indicated below in the comments on the new draft lease article by article. As regards the print upon which Mr. Ballantyne's amendments have been made, this has been compared with the original form of Mining Lease attached to the Agreement of 2,nd December, 1925, and, except for the following, it is substantially the same. The differences consist of (i) the preamble, (ii) a provision relating to jurisdiction over foreigners on page 4 (Article V.), (iii) the measurement and accounts clauses, pages 5 and 6 (Article VII), (iv) British Control Clauses, pages 7 and 8 (Article SIY to XYI) and (v) the interpretation clause, page 8, (Article XKIII). Except for the first two these provisions are copied from the Agreements of 12th June, 1930, and 15th February, 1933. Preamble . No comment, Article I . Provision for erecting and maintaining boundary marks has been provided for as suggested by H.M.Government. Article TT . A clause has now been inserted to cover provision for handing over wells and property on expiry of agreement. The/- a - Ths warding is not Quite ulie ss-me as ^6 suggss'fcGd., Yfs proposed that 'all productive wells and borings shall 'be handed ovei in good order and repair and fit for fnrthsr working', The new clause {Eider B page 2) says that 'all borings (including casing therein) which the Company has not abandoned shall oe handed over in reasonably good order and repair'. In addition all immoTable property is to be handed back to the Sheikh and he is to have the option to purchase all other property at replacement value, less depreciation. In the event of dispute the price is to be settled by Arbitration. It is suggested that the Article as revised can be excepted. /The old Article III , has beoi deleted. This provided for the payment of a lump sum of Es.10,000 on signature of the lease and for the annual payment of a sum of Es.10,000 for five years or until the Company declared that oil had been found in 'Commercially exploitable quantities'. This matter is discussed below on Articles YII and YlllJ Article III . Exemption from taxes and inroort duties . The original draft provided for exemption until two years after the Company declared that oil had been found in 'commercially exploitable quantities, or for a term of 10 years'. There may be some ambiguity as to the date from which the 10 years was intended to run, although it is submitted that H.M. Government would be justified in maintaining that it could only be from th date of the original agreement, viz. 2nd December, 19H5. In the revised draft the reference to 'commercially exploitable quantities' has been deleted and exemption from taxes is Proposed for a term of 10 years from the date of the mining lease. It can very well be argued from the fact that the Company is proposing this year to ship oil in oubstantia quantities/- 3 - (J&amp; / y3 quant iuies, tli8,t oil has been discovered in 'commercially exploitable quantities'. m seeking to secure exemption from taxes and cusuoms duties for a period of 10 years from the date of the lease the Company appears to be trying to secure a substantial new concession. I g is no g suggested that this should necessarily be tuined down, but it will be a useful counter in the bargaining on cei tain points where tlie Company has not yet met our desires. Article IY . /Thenumbering ofthis Article has not been altered in the copy furnished to the Petroleum Department./ The second paragraph has been redrafted (see Eider C page 3) and subject to the addition of the words 'arising in Bahrein' after the word 'cause' in line 2 of the new paragraph, this might be accepted. Article Y . No comment by the Petroleum Department. This article contains on page 4 the new paragraph as to jurisdiction over dbreigners to which reference is made above on page 1. Article YE . No comment by Petroleum Department. Articles 1/11 and YIII . It will be convenient to discuss these two Articles together, as they' deal with the question of royalty payments. ■ In these Articles, as revised, the Company has made provision intended to meet our requirements set out in A 2, ( measurement and accounts ) , B (old Article III) (j. 0 y a I'fcrv r on a II oil -produced ) . and B (old Article YIII) on natural gas and casinghead gasolin e) of the schedule of amendments. The following comments arise on these points:- (a) Measurement ani Accounts : The clauses which have been inserted are those which were accepted 'in the Supplementary Agreement of 15th February, 1933. (b) Boyalty on all oil produced; The Petroleum Department suggested that the only oil which/- 4 - Which Should be exempt from royalty should be 'oil required as fuel for drilling purposes and for pumping to field storage'. This is the basis adopted in ne W regulations recently made in Trinidad. The Company adhere to the wording of the original agreement which gives exemption to 'oil required for the customary operations of the Company's installations in the Sheikh 's territories'. We cannot claim that there is uniformity of practice on this point, and might therefore be prepared in the course of the negotiations not to press this point, Royalty on natural and casinghead gasoline : The Petroleum Department proposed a royalty of four annas per 1, 000 cubic feet of natural gas sold, and a royalty of one anna gallon in respect oi. casingliead gasoline. The Company include casinghead gasoline with crude oil and propose a royalty equal to one-sixth of the field price receiyed from the sale of any natural gas recovered by the Company. What the Petroleum Department had in mind, in English currency, was 2d, per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas and -g-d. a gallon for casinghead gasoline, but an error was made in converting these amounts into annas and the rates proposed to the Company were therefore higher than was intended. In the Iraq Petroleum Company's Agreement a royalty of 2d. per 1,000 cubic feet has to be paid on natural gas and 'this is the rate levied in Trinidad. There are some advantages in having a definite rate of loyalty but the Petroleum Department does not- suggest that, in a Place like Bahrein, this is likely to be a very important matter, and here again we might be prepared to give way during the negotiations. Casinghead gasoline is a more valuable produce than crude oil/oil, included with, crude oil, the royalty would be a good deal less than -g-d. per gallon. This is a point which might be further discussed with the Company. In the United States the practice, in the case of casinghead gasoline produced in California, is to charge a royalty of one-sixth to one-eighth of the value of the stabilised natural gasoline, less cost of stabilisation. The Petroleum Department has no definite informatic: as to what this would represent in English currency, hut it would probably be in the neighbourhood of ^d. a gallon. At this rate the royalty on a ton of casinghead gasoline would be about 12/6d. against the rate of 5/3d. on crude oil. The Company may argue that they will only be able to dispose of this gasoline, which is a highly volatile product, by mixing it with the crude oil. If they do, it is suggested that we need not press the point unduly. One other relatively unimportant point on Article VII, may be mentioned. The original agreement provided for the possibility of revising the rate of royalty after ten years during which, royalties had been paid. The Company have now substituted fifteen years. They may claim some virtue for this, hut, inasmuch as under the original agreement no tonnage royalty might have been due for payment during the first five years (i.e. until the Company had declared that oil had been discovered in 'commercially exploitable quantities' )» there would be no substance in their claim. Having disposed of the more detailed points it is now possible to examine the two revised Articles from the broader Point of view of determining whether they represent a fair basis as between the Sheikh and the Company. Under the original agreement, the SheikH was to receive Rs.lo^oOO on the signing of the lease and Es.10,000 per annum t hereafter/'■tli6F©3.f'tsr until 'bhs Company should declape ■tlia't oil has beon discovered in 'commercially exploitable quantities' when a tonnage royalty was to be paid on all oil produced, with a minimum payment of Rs, 30,000 per annum. The declaration as to commercial production had to be made within five years or the Sheikh could require the Company to surrender the lease. In the revised draft lease the Company has deleted all reference to a declaration of commercial production and provide forthwith to do what under the original agreement they might not have been required to do for five years after the granting of a mining lease. That the Company will presumably argue is as far as they ought to be expected to go. As they are no?/ making arrangements to ship substantial quantities of oil, they may admit that they would find it difficult to say that they had not discovered oil in commercial quantities, and if oil is going to be produced in quantity why should the Sheikh bother because he will get his royalties? But in fact the Company has virtually given a?;ay the minimum of Rs.30,000 in the Agreement of the 21st November, 1933, relating to the prospecting licence, and we might therefore claim on behalf of the Sheikh that under the Mining Lease he could, on the basis of the original arrangement, reasonably expect to receive a higher minimum than the revised prospecting licence provides for. This question is discussed in the letter from the Petroleum Department of the 15th February, 1934, to Mr, Laithwaite, and in the note of the discussion which Mr. Laithwaite had with Mr. Ballantyne on the 16th May, 1934. These tvro documents can form the basis of the further discussion with the Company, when it is suggested an effort should be made 'to secure a larger minimum royalty than Rs.30,000 (about £2,E50), There also seems no reason why the Sheikh should/sHould not receive the lump sum. payment on signing the lease which the original agreement provides,for. One other point remains on these two Articles which has a definite 'bearing on the question of minimum royalty. In Article VIII. the minimum, of Rs.30,000 is payable in respect of any complete calendar year in Y /hich the Company continues work. In the former Article X. the Company was required to do a certain amount of work continuously, and therefore, except when the Company did not work for causes teyond their control, they had to pay the Rs. 30,000. Sow the Company propose to replace the old Article X. by a new Article IX. in which there is a proviso which would, in certain circumstances which are not difficult of attainment, relieve the Company of the obligation of continuous working. It is suggested therefore that Article Till, should be revised after 'Rs»30,000 n to read 'in any completed calendar year in which this lease continues in operation'. The reference to Article V. in Article VIII. should be altered to Article IV, The Company have also inserted a new Article XI. which gives them the right to terminate the lease on giving three months' notice, so that, if the increased minimum royalties which have been suggested ?/ere to prove onerous, the Company can get rid of the obligation by exercising their rights under Article XI, Article ty . This Article has been revised by the Company, ^here is no objection to it in its new form provided the alteration to Article VIII. suggested above is agreed to by the Company, This Article has been redre-fted partly to meet the point raised in- our schedule of amendments (B, Article XII. ) and/and although slightly different in form can be regarded as meeting our point. Article_Z. It is suggested that the w.rds 'referred to In Article IV' should be substituted for the words 'beyond their control' in lines 5 and 6; and that the word 'paragraph' should oe sabsti uufced fcr the word 'sentence' in the last line but one. i.nib ? as already pointed out, is a new Clause which the Company has put in which enables them to surrender the leu.se on giving tnree months' notice. Under the present Agreement (Article VII of the main part) the Company has the right to stop work if they do not find oil in sufficient quantity. The Company evidently feel now that this does not give them suxxicient protection. Subject to the Company meeting H.M.Government on the points raised on Articles Til and VIII (f the new draft lease, there is no objection to accepting this. Article XII . An addit ion has been made to this Article to meet the last part of the proposal made in our schedule of amendments (B. Article XII) ■ s to preventing any uncontrolled flow of oil. Article .71TT . Ho comment. Articles ZIV to SYII . These are the British control clauses lifted from the Supplementary Agreement of 12th June, 1930, with the reference to Major Holmes deleted. A rticles XVIII to igq . There are new Articles inserted by the Company which in the main meet the points raised in our schedule of amendments (C. 1 to 4). In C.l it was proposed that the Company should keep correct geological plans and re cords which should be open to inspection by the Sheikh. This the/- 9 - the Company have not accepted but it is an important and very widely accepted provision. it appears in the Iraq petroleum Company B.O.D. and Persian concessions. m fact in those concessions the Company is required to furnish the Governments concerned with geological reports. The same provision is made, in Trinidad. m this country there is a statutory provision, which covers all mining activities, requiring operators to furnish to the Government Geological Survey Department all geological information which the Depart menu may require. It is suggested therefore that we should press the Company on this. If they required us to insert a provision that the geological reports should he regarded as confidential for a period, we could not resist this.

But similar statistics for a consecutive period of years, such as those of the United Kingdom oil supplies given in this issue, can be used with fairness to reach certain general conclusions. No survey giving a clear indication of the trend as to oil-consigning countries over a period of six years has been published before In the future much of this information will be supplied monthly by the Board of Trade, but for the figures until this year the collation of such statistics has entailed great effort. This survey is paiticularly oppor tune in that it covers a period of revolutionary change, as the graph accompanying the article depicts clearly. To afl but those to whom figures are mere dead things these data well repay study. They give rise to many interesting observations, a few of which may bcnotccL Firstly, there has been a since 1928,486 THE PETROLEUM TIMES. May 5, 1934 more accurately, from the beginning of 1930. From that time to the end of last year the United States and the Dutch West Indies have almost changed places as the leading consignors. One may choose to consider the latter as practically representing Venezuela, since in recent years crude from Venezuela has formed the basis of most of the Dutch West Indian oil exports. American supplies have fallen in these six years to a poor third place, with those fiom the Dutch West Indies reaching almost the same great hold on the British market the United States had for so long. It would be more correct to say that this revolutionary change has been wrought in the three years since 1920. Many reasons may have helped to account for this. Foremost must surely be the United States oil import tariffs and their consequences in forcing new outlets for foreign oils to be found. America cannot be blamed for protecting her own markets in the face of domestic over-production, but, as is now becoming evident, it is a policy not without disadvantages, even dangers. There are signs this year that America is regaining some of the British trade lost, doubtless assisted by current exchange rates. This may continue, but it is difficult to visualise a return to the former position of supremacy. Other factors, some partly conjecture in their detailed effects, have undoubtedly played apart in effect ing the changes made clear by this survey. Among such are the measure of agreement for the co-ordination of interests now existent between the Royal Dutch-Shell and the Anglo-Persian oil companies ; the vast extension of the Standard of New Jersey's foreign interests through the Pan-American deal; and lastly, the belief that the leading international oil groups in conference a few years ago decided on certain principles of more rational geographical distribution of oils to European and other markets. Some of these factors suggest that the decline in American oils by no means implies a corresponding loss m revenue to American oil companies. It is certain that this has not been the case, and, financially, for all one can tell, America may indirectly be now gaining a far larger proportion from the British trade than the 1933 figures would suggest. Wliile Dutch West Indian and American consignments have been changing places, Persia has retained a fairly constant share of the trade—with one important differ ence. From the standpoint of British industrial activity and empioyment one can but regret the substitution of finished oils for imports of the raw material. Since 1928 crude oils declined from 408.4 to 221.7 million gallons while refined products rose to 369.2 from a mere 85.8 million gallons. This reflects largely the change in the function of the company's South Wales refinery primarily to a manufactory of special products. The trade has no desire to see any complicated licensing system, or any degree of compulsion, instituted for home oil refining, but there are many who feel that there would be national advantages in fiscal preferences to encourage domestic production of a larger proportion of such oils as indigenous coal can never yield in adequate quantities on a competitive basis for decades, if ever. The danger that any such policy would produce excess fuel oil f compete further with coal should not be impossible 1° overcome. 0 Even among the smaller suppliers' figures manv interesting suggestions arise. Roumania is an instance Why last year's decline in the British market ?--W regarded as her principal oil outlet. Any inability to compete with oils from other sources must be due not to the lack of skill or enterprise of Roumania's petroleum industrialists but to burdens imposed in the countrv by the State. Excessive taxation in its many forms high charges for oil transport facilities not always in keeping with modern requirements ; and particularly the lack of pipelines are all obstacles to Roumania's oil export trade which are undoubtedly contributory factors. ^ On the great decline in Russian oil imports since 1931, much could be written did space permit. In 1930 these held almost as large a share of the British trade as the Dutch West Indies. To what extent Russia can be expected to purchase British manufactured goods if this country ceases to purchase one of the few commo dities Russia has to sell must be left for others to decide One thing is certain, no longer can the cry of Russian oii dumping be raised. It was shown in this journal last week that the values of her oils are alone in showing a general rise this year. Other points disclosed in this survey are the gradual rise of Mexican deliveries and of Peruvian crude ; the decline in direct Venezuelan deliveries ; the cessation of Colombian oils ; the regrettable waning of British Empire sources such as Sarawak and Straits Settlements ; and finally, the Trinidad position. While last year deliveries of crude oil from that colony showed an increase, over the period back to 1928 the position has been a replace ment by refined oils, particularly by motor spirit in recent years. The result is that the 1933 total almost reached the record of 1929 in gallonage, but with far greater financial benefit from the substitution of higher price products although the country has lost certain benefits from home refining. Even if all the British Empire oil exports could never occupy any very large share of the British oil trade, it might still be in the interests of inter-imperial commerce to institute some degree of fiscal preference to the few Empire oil sources. The details disclosed by this survey of the money paid these consigning countries suggest that there is much foundation for the assertion made recently to the Oil Industries Club by Mr. F. Godber. He claimed that only a small part of the money spent in Great Britain on so- called foreign oils found its way into foreign pockets. By far the greater part, in his opinion, remained in British hands. Having briefly surveyed past changes, we can turn to the future. Is the present position likely to remain stable for a while ? There are many answers petroleum economists will await with interest. Can America recover her trade ? Is Roumania's setback but tem porary ? Can Russia once again become the important factor she was ?—are some such queries. Or is the present but a phase in a larger changeover not yet fully apparent ? Even disregarding the vast new oil sources of Russia awaiting development, there are the proved fields of Iraq, and, to a lesser extent, of Bahrein Islands, and possibly Morocco awaiting outlets—al factors that may affect future world oil distribution. Many would give much to know the answers to such problems. u st , 0 111 ba# 111 , r- I .

Gasoline stocks at refineries on April 28 totalled 37,798,000 barrels, compared with 39,174,000 barrels on April 21. FROM A DOZEN TO TWENTY-ONE. The unsatisfactory nature of the present position in regard to compulsory regulation of the industry is shown by the fact that the Oil Code Planning and Co-ordinating Committee of the nation will soon be enlarged. It has 12 members at present and the proposal is to add nine others. The new members will, it is stated, represent groups that have not hitherto been able to make their influence felt. BARNSDALL CALIFORNIA WELL. Mott No. 1 well of Barnsdall Corporation, in Mountain View field, is reported flowing 31 gravity oil at rate of 60 barrels an hour through a 32-64 choke. Oil is cutting about 10 per cent, water, but is said to be cleaning up rapidly. There is 1,000 pounds pressure on the casing. The well is 6,290 ft. deep. The company controls 220 acres in the vicinity of the new well. Another well, Hubro No. 1, is still coring at depth of 5,115 ft., but officers of the company report that the oil sand has already been picked up at this depth. STANDARD OF CALIFORNIA. Mr. K. R. Kingsbury, president of Standard Oil Com pany of California, states in his annual report that the company entered 1933 with realisations on the sale of its products below normal. During the first quarter the com pany suffered a loss of some 700,000 dols. Thereafter con ditions improved, and were better until October, when another price war reduced retail prices to unremunerative levels, he states. For the first six months last year net income was 1,199,414 dols., or 9 cents a share. 'Until the approval of the petroleum code under the National Industrial Recovery Act in August,' says Mr. Kingsbury, ' the production of crude oil in California was under a voluntary proration curtailment plan. After the advent of the code conditions did not materially improve, but it is hoped that with further development of the pro vision of control which the code contemplates, beneficial results will eventually be achieved, and many of the evils which beset the petroleum industry eliminated.' 9,172,160 DOLS. ON PLANT. The company last year expended 9,172,160 dols. in in creasing its plant facilities, primarily in production and marketing activities. Its crude oil production last year under proration averaged 98,749 barrels daily, an increase of 1,004 barrels over 1932. Of the production, 87,709 barrels foily were in California. Crude oil run at refineries averaged 111,658 barrels daily, against 117,157 daily in 1932. the end of last year the company had 3,494 completed 011 and gas wells, of which 1,888 were shut in, all but 69 of the latter being in California. BAHREIN. Development work started in 1931 in the Bahrein islands in the Persian Gulf was continued last y e ar. It is indicated that expectations of developing an oil e ld of substantial importance have been realised, the re port says, adding that when facilities are completed the wells will be put on commercial production. GEOLOGISTS IN ARABIA. The company last year obtained a concession on the mainland of Arabia facing the Persian Gulf. This conces sion covers 165,000 square miles, equivalent to an area slightly larger than the state of California. The area is being explored by geological parties. In its marketing activities through Standard Stations, Incorporated, the company attained a stronger position, through acquisition of 48 new locations and extensive modernisation and improvement of existing outlets. Inventory of petroleum products, valued at 42,429,150 dols at the 1933 year-end, consisted of 55,430,918 barrels at 76.54 cents a barrel. The quantity decreased 4,232,147 barrels (mainly fuel oil) during the year and the rate per barrel decreased 4.7 cents. A new annuity plan for employees has been adopted, the employee now sharing in the cost. The plan is being effectuated in conjunction with one of the largest in surance companies. Mr. Kingsbury stresses the magnitude of taxes, seating that the company collected 21,705,977 dols. in gasoline and lubricating oil taxes in 1933—a figure nearly three times the net profit, and not including other taxes totalling 4,262,419 dols. PAN-AMERICAN RICHFIELD. Federal Judge William P. James at Los Angeles has tentatively authorised a organisation plan calculated to culminate in the sale of Richfield and Pan-American on companies to the Standard Oil Company of California for approximately 23,500,000 dols., according to mail advices. Judge James agreed to supervise the reorganisation, while stipulating that he would make no recommendation to bondholders or creditors as to the fairness of the plan. At the same time, he told representatives of the Cities Service Company, majority stockholders in Pan-American and a large bondholder in Richfield, that he would con sider an alternative reorganisation plan. Cities Service had opposed the sale to Standard Oil, which had been re commended by a committee of Richfield bondholders, calling the 23,500,000 dols. ' an unfairly inadequate price, hardly one-third of the real value of the properties.' The judge promised that acceptance of the Standard Oil offer shall be shelved if a better plan is presented. A COMPANY REDUCES ITS SCOPE. Mr. E. J. Marston, president of Texas Pacific Coal and Oil Company, states in the annual report that directors and officers have taken steps to confine the company's activities to the oil and gas business. Steps have been taken to discontinue the operation of Texas Pacific Mercantile and Manufacturing Company, Thurber Brick Company, Thurber Tank Line Company and Thurber Construcfron Company, which are wholly-owned subsidiaries. e assets of these companies, with the exception of Thurber Tank Line Company, are being liquidated as rapidly as possible. Mining equipment and all other excess stocks connected with former operations are being salvagea.

During 1933 the company paid on this account 134 003 dols.

Against surplus last year 3,644,108 dols. were charged for adjustments, the main item being 3,062,464 dols. for re valuation of physical property. NEW OIL FIELD IN KANSAS. Standard Oil Company of Indiana's oil producing sub sidiary, Stanolind Oil and Gas Company, has completed one well in Reno County, Kansas, which apparently opens a new oil field in that State, and has also completed six wells in already-known fields in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. The new wells show a total of 7,800 barrels a day on test. The discovery well in Reno County, Kansas, lb miles south of the Burton pool, has been drilled to a depth of 4,067 feet and is flowing on test at a rate of 1,000 barrels of pipe-line oil a day. Stanolind owns, jointly with Amerada Corporation, 2,640 acres of leases around the well. DEATH OF FAMOUS OIL MARKETER. Mr. W. B. Walker, senior vice-president of the Socony- Vacuum Corporation, in charge of the company's Far Eastern vatic v - an J president of oie newly formed Standard Vacuum Oil Company, died at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, following an operation. Mr. Walker, who was 60 years of age, had been associated with Stan dard Oil Company of New York since 1895 and was one of the leaders in establishing the company in the Far East, as well as one of the outstanding authorities on the mar keting of petroleum in these markets. The recent merger of the Far Eastern marketing outlets of the Socony-Vacuum Corporation with the pro ducing and refining properties of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in the Far East into a jointly- owned subsidiary, Standard Vacuum Oil Company, which he headed, brought into being a dream which Mr. Walker had fostered for many years. Mr. Walker spent the greater part of his career in the Far East. Joining the company in January 1, 1895, he was shortly sent to Hong Kong, six months after the company had established its first office there. In 1899 he was ap pointed representative and opened a branch for the com pany in the Philippines, remaining there until 1902, when he returned to Hong Kong as assistant general manager of the South China department, becoming general man ager for the territory including South China, Indo-China, Siam, Straits Settlements, Dutch East Indies, Formosa and the Philippine Islands in 1916. In the autumn of 1923 he was elected a director of the Standard Oil Company of New York and made his head quarters in New York. When the Standard Oil Company of New York and the Vacuum Oil Company merged he became a director and vice-president of the new company. OKLAHOMA CITY POTENTIALS. A heavy decline of potentials of wells in the Simpson zone, below the Wilcox, in the Oklahoma City field during the last six months is shown in new potential tests for the first 20 wells. Figures compiled by the proration um pire's staff show aggregate new potential for these wells of 12,864 barrels daily, compared with 44,201 barrels six months ago, or an average decline of 70 per cent. Water encroachment into many wells in this zone is serious. A sharp decline in potentials was expected by proration officials, because the zone has been unable to make its monthly allowable for several months past. The combined new potential for 396 Wilcox -zone wells is 1,537,976 barrels daily, comparing with 2,523,291 barrels six months ago, or an average decline of 39 pe r cent. While oil men are watching the Denver Producing and Refining Company well No. 1 Noe, in Section 34-10-10, near Binger, Northern Caddo County, which is waiting for bailing and swabbing operations to eliminate obstacles to completion of the well, the Messer area near Edmond, in Oklahoma County, is also attracting attention. The Mid-Kansas (Ohio Oil) No. 1 discovery well came in late in 1930 and has been shut in, with royalty owners pro tected by advance payments. This well, in section 32-14-3, when opened recently flowed 826 barrels in 24 hours. A location for one new test has been announced, and Standard of Indiana is sur veying for a pipe line into the area. Operators probably will ask the Corporation Commission for permits to pro duce back allowable at the rate of 50 barrels a day since completion, less large production at that time. TEXAS NEW WELLS AND LAND DEALS. No. 1 Nannie Wills well of Seaboard Oil Company and Tide Water Oil Company in the Cayuga field, North-wes tern Anderson County, Texas, has cored 10 ft. of saturated Woodbine sand from 4,055 ft. to 4,065 ft., 18 ft. higher than in the discovery well. This is taken to indicate an uplift in a north-easterly direction. The No. 1 Edens, discovery well, is 1J miles south-east of the Wills test. No. 5 Monnig, test of Tide Water Oil Company and Seaboard Oil Company, ten miles west of Palestine in the Long Lake field of Anderson County, has blown in as a gasser, variously estimated from 50,000,000 cubic ft. to 100,000,000 cubic ft. daily capacity. It is half a mile north and 1,000 ft. east of the Long Lake discovery well. No effort will be made to test the well for oil production. Pine Lodge Oil Company of Houston has paid 12,500 dols. in cash and the same amount in oil for 49 acres in the A. Enos survey. Byrd-Frost, Inc., has paid 2,500 dols. cash, with drilling contract, on 200 acres in the Robert Erwin survey, eight miles south-east of Palestine. The lease was owned by Southern Pine Lumber Company, which also leased to A. Webb Roberts five acres in the same survey for 500 dols. in cash and 1,500 dols. in oil. Standard Oil of Indiana, credited with paying 30,000 dols. cash for a half interest in the Byrd-Frost Inc., Slocum wild-cat well, recently paid 5,500 dols. for a lease on 209 acres in the Robert Erwin and Jesse Gibson surveys, Anderson County. CHANGE OF NAME. The name of Pennsylvania Lubricating Company, a subsidiary of Colonial Beacon Oil Company (U.S.A.), has been changed to Penola, Inc. The company manufactures industrial lubricants and other special industrial products and has plants at Pittsburgh; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; El Dorada, Kansas; and Baltimore, Maryland. 4-^ OLD FORTS AS PETROL STATIONS. Three old forts belonging to the Copenhagen harbour authorities, Trekoner, Mellemfortet and Provestenen, have been taken over to be converted into petrol storage installations.THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED Sho Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, June 1, 1934, NO. PA '83 His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear Sir: / T beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter NO» c /503-10/'l(b) dated May 9, 1934, informing me of the peimisslon granted by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin ♦Isa Al Khalifah for the use of radio telephones with certain limitations. However, since such permission does not allow the Company to use the instru ments to the extent necessary for maximum efficiency and economy of ships* time, tt may at a later date request that the question be re considered. I note your statement in subparagraph (c) that this per mission represents a special concession to the Company to which t is not entitled and that His Excellency expects the Company to take it into account in considering the changes which he may wish to have made in the Mining Lease, This assertion is undoubtedly prompted by the same considerations which occasioned the similar one in your letter No, c/l46-10/l,VII dated February 26, 1934, granting permission for the Company to acquire certain lands on Sitra Island, For the Company's response to that statement, I would refer you to my letter PA— SO, dated April 16, -■ 0 -» which should pertain to the present instance as well. Referring to Paragraph 2 of your letter under reply: The ngkCompany entirely fails to understand why the previous consent to the employment of a Mooring Master and Pilot should be deemed to he necessary, seeing that the piloting of vessels to the Company* s anchorage and the mooring of vessels are matters solely connected with the Company's own operations of producing oil under its con cession Agreement and that this work of piloting and mooring is work undertaken by the Company* s own Official. The Company cannot but feel that there is some misunder standing of the true position in the minds of the Advisers to the Bahrein Government, particularly as the principle which is sought to be introduced is a new one and directly contrary to the freedom of action accorded to the Company by its Concession Agreement and essential to the successful carrying out of its operations at Bahrein# On the other hand, the creation of reasonable and con sistent Harbor Regulations concerning the movements and care of in coming and outgoing vessels within the Territorial Waters of the Bahrein Government are, of course, an entirely different matter and one in which the Bahrein Government could look to the fullest and most lively cooperation of the Cojapsjoy• It seems to the Company that there has, perhaps, been a failure to make clear in your letter under reply that it is these Regulations the Bahrein Government have in mind and I am to request that the matter should be given further consideration by the Govern ment and that the Company should receive assurance that interference with its freedom of action in appointing its own Officials xs notsought♦ In conclusion, I think I cannot do better than tell you that it is within my knowledge that wherever there is a submarine Loading Line it has been found to be necessary to keep a Tnan on the spot who is familiar not only with the channel but with the tech nique of placing properly a boat at its anchorage to receive the Loading Line* Itiis is an intricate matter and requires experience and knowledge of local conditions. Uie Line must be picked up without kinking and the boat must at all times be kept from driving over the Line, otherwise it gets torn away. A great deal of care must be exercised in letting go the Line and care must be taken to lay it on the bottom of the sea without kinking. These operations can only be learned through experience; a mistake would cause serious disaster.

T.C.Fowle, Lt.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. attested . vis Major, Secretary to the political ResidentHis Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear Sir: ^ ✓ In a recent letter, No.PA-88 dated June 1st, I attempted to briefly describe to you the duties of the so-called Mooring Master at Bahrein. A letter has just been received from Mr. Lombard i which contains a more complete explanation of the real nature of this man's duties. Believing it will give you and through you His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifah a much clearer con ception of the position than the former communication was able to do, I am giving you herewith an extract of the information contained in Mr. Lombardi's letter 'Perhaps the nature of the duties to be performed by the Mooring Master (which term, we think, should properly be Mooring Director) in connection with the operation of our submarine loading-line has not been made entirely clear to you. In the first place, some misunderstanding as to the nature of the duties may have arisen through the fact that Captain 3; els on was originally referred to at times as the 'Harbor Master . From such a designation I can understand how tne Govern ment could eas ily gain the impression that we desired Captain Kelson to assume some jurisdiction over the harbor itself - which, of course, is not the intention. There is no desire for Captain Nelson's duties to con flict with any proper governmental functions. 'I note also that there seems to be an impression that Captain Kelson will serve as a Pilot, in addition to his functions as Mooring Director. It has never been our plan that Captain Nelson should serve as a Pilot in the true sense of the word. He will, it is true if requested - go out to meet the tankers as they come into the terminal, and assist the captains in mooriLe, their ships at the end of the loading line. Were-2- Captaln Nelson to take control of the wheel of the ship and act as a Pilot, this would mean the assumption of responsibility for the safe conduct of the ship; there has never been any thought on our part that the Mooring Director should assume such responsibility and, consequently, I think it is really a misnomer for him to be classified in any way as a Pilot. I hope you will be able to make it clear that, in acting as Mooring Director, Captain Nelson will be merely a private employee of ^he Bahrein Petroleum. Company, and that his duties will not partake of a public nature such as would inevitably be the case were he to be a Harbor Master or a ''ilot. 'As I see it. Captain Nelson will really be our Port Captain, looking out for our crnnindividual marine affairs. In his capacity as Mooring Director for the submarine line, it will be his duty to assist the tanker captains in making proper connections between their ships and the hose at the end'of the line. Picking up the hose and making the con nection so that damage to the line will be avoided and no oil will be spilled into the water is a job requiring experience on the part of the man handling the operation. Also, it requires expert guidance in making the disconnection and placing the hose on the bottom without kinking, ready for the next pick up, after the tanker has been loaded. We have found, through our experience in operating other submarine loading-lines on the Pacific Coast and in Mexico, that many Tanker captains coming into a submarine loading- terminal for the first time have only a hazy idea of the accomplishment of the tasks involved in making the con nections and disconnections. It is for this reason tha we must have a thoroughly-experienced employee to serve _ as Mooring Director. Lack of experience and skill in this work will almost inevitably result in damage to the line, failure to make connections with the tankers, and loss of oil. Captain Nelson was picked for this position on. account of his long experience under varied condi^o 218 5 _ and we have full confidence in his ability to handle the v/ork under any circumstance which may arise. 'It seems to me that the reply you have suggested is entirely in order - except for ^ r f ere ^® appointment of Captain Nelson as Pilot. From wha l have said above, you will understand that I think the reference to his capacity as Pilot should be eliminated. Tours very truly. PAD/J E.A.

The British Government asked that they should drop their claim and deliver tne same to them. The President of the Persian Delegates in the League of Nations referred the matter to the League of Nations and supported the claim of his Government with historical proofs. The British Delegate also defended the case 01 Bahrain. Notes were then exchanged in which each of them rebutted the contentions of the other and the British Government stood by their contentions that the Bahrain Islands are oeing Governed 'by their Rulers A1 Khalifah for over 100 years ana that there are treaties between them and those Amirs according to which they(British) undertook to protect the principality and defend it and that they cannot fail to do in accordance with their undertakings. The matter remained as it is and we heard nothing about it afterwards. Apparently the production of Oil in Bahrain and the preparations which the .American Company, wtiich is a branch of the Standard Oil of California, are making for the early export of oil has dug out the question again and caused the Persian Government to reopen their claim. We read in the Persian papers received today that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement in the Chamber of Deputies which r may he summarised as follows I Early in Aoril 1930 one of the officials of the Persian oil Government discovered some new/wells in Bahrain hut previous to this a British Gompany was given Concession for the product ion of Oil in Bahrain which 'began their work. Bahrain being part of Persia which cannot be separated from it and. as the Persian Government have authority over it- it being apit of the Government oropertyi the Government warned tne British fiiQxsxKffisjak Company that they should cease their operations foi the production of oil in Bahrain and have explained to uiiem that they do not admit the rights granted to them but consider — ■ T J2 (jZoTjp /fr them as void and reserve the right over them .The Persian Government claim their rights in full. At the same time the Persian government submitted a protest to the League of Nations which was put before the members of the League. Sometime ago the Persian Government were informed that several importai^/well £ were discovered in Bahrain and before they could take steps to stop the first Company from producing oil it has come to our notice that the American Company- Standard Oil of California, declared that they have shares in this Company and thus took active part in producing and exporting it for outside. The mattei ■ was referred to the British parliament but they did not admit any iignt ^or us. Therefore, the Persian Government, who consider that interference in the Bahrain affairs is an aggression on t.t-eir right, will take the necessary steps to recover their right Two days ago a protest was sent to t2ie American Embassy,Tehran in which it was explained tnat the concession granted to the Standard Oil Company or other Concessions in Bahrain, have not been jas: given by the Persian Government and as such are considered as void and have no effect. That the Persian Government will strongly object to them. A copy of this protest was sent to the Government 01 the United States of America for communication to the said Company a.na a copy of the same was sent to London and to the League of Hations for submission to the members. The Minister concluded by saying that the Government will take the necessary steps to protect their rights. In the 20th Qentury, oil became a cause of trouble and dispute among nations. ft r. r ?

Although most people are aware that the petroleum industry makes a large direct contribution to the Ex chequer in this country, it will come as a surprise to many that the net revenue from oil duties in the year 1933-34 was over £40,000,000. The Customs duty on motor spirit brought in just under £37,000,000, and nearly £600,000 was obtained from the tax on other spirit. Heavy oils, which were, as readers know, subject to tax for nearly the whole of the year, but not quite all of it, brought in over £2 200 000, and Excise duties on heavy oils produced something less than £600,000. The table on another page is very instructive as showing that petrol and heavy oils, both products of petroleum, contribute practically all the Customs duties on oil products.

BURMAH OIL. On April 19—four weeks ago— u Oil News ' stated: u Throughout all the changes of the past few weeks Bur mah Ordinary have stood firm and even advanced; and it would not surprise us if they advanced to £5 in con nection with the forthcoming report and meeting.' Bur mah Ordinary were then 93s. 9d.; they are now, as every one knows, well above £5. We are quite content to leave the matter without further comment in this place; but a Note upon it will be found under ' Oil Finance of the Week.' FOUR MONTHS' IMPORTS. Imports to April 30, 1934, are considerably ahead of those for the corresponding period last year, being 872,811,000 gallons, against 797,353,000 gallons, the latter figure showing an advance on 1931. The dark side of the picture is that the 1934 total is valued at £10,672,027, whereas the smaller total for 1933 was valued at £10,990,739. A feature of the crude imports is the increase in Persian oil from 68,337,000 gallons last year to 85,293,000 gallons this year and the falling off in crude arrivals from the Dutch West Indies. In spite of the general belief that there is a considerably larger consumption of motor spirit this year, and the statement of Mr. Parish, of the Standard of New Jersey, that this amounts to 13 per cent., total motor spirit imports for the four months are practically stationary, being 349,726,000 gallons, against 347,831,000 gallons. Here the decline in value per unit volume is clear, for the 1934 quantity is valued at £5,173,726 and the 1933 quantity at £5,680,472. Again, in lubricating oils, we see the lower values. The total value is about the same in 1933 and 1934—in the neighbourhood of £1,192,000; but the 1934 quantity corresponding to it is 34,559,000 gallons, against 29,164,000 gallons in 1933. Petrol value c.i.f. was an average of 3.55d. per gallon for the four months. Full details appear on other pages. the position is much the same as after the conferences of three years ago. It was then promised that the Ameri cans should put their house in order and restrict pro duction so that a common world policy might be framed. The Russians showed their good sense, when a world conference met subsequently, by declining to come into an arrangement until America had gained control of its output. That has since been partially accomplished, and only partially. Until control has been wholly achieved it is impossible to negotiate with America as a known quantity. That is one of the things we have been point ing out for years past; and Mr. Parish now says prac tically the same in the statement of his which appears in this issue. The struggle of Mr. Roosevelt's oil helpers, in face of a hostile Congress, to obtain further control of the oil industry is a piece of self-confession that control has not been achieved. j\ BAHREIN. We have published a good deal about the progress that has been made on Bahrein Island in the Persian Gulf by interests controlled by the Standard Oil Com pany of California. This week we publish a reproduc tion of the company's own relief map of the island and its surroundings. The first cargo of Bahrein crude will leave the island late this summer in the tanker which the company sent there some months ago to bring equipment. It is a remarkable achievement by a company situate just about half the globe away from the scene of operations; and the quietness, thoroughness and ultimate success of those operations are features upon which all concerned are to be congratulated.

Gottfried Feder rema that the starting point for broadening the basis of raw minerals of fuel must be a systematic investig of German raw materials and a systematic applicatk methods of treatment. With regard to motor fuels 1 must be a planned increase in the storage capacity of materials from abroad. Further alternative source fuels must be exploited, such as distillation tar, gene gas, hydrogen, the wood gas generator, coal slack, In this direction he pointed with satisfaction to the ' extension by Privy Councillor Bosch of the plan Leuna, and said that many such plants in other p were required. A determined effort must be made to reduce ( while the Government, for its part, would do its be reduce taxation of the industry in so far as such tax was not for protection purposes. MOTOR-CAR FIGURES. Dr. Todt, the Inspector-General of Road Constru in Germany, dealt with the connection between th industry and road construction, and stated that ir previous month the construction of motor roads had ployed about 10,000 men, requirements in the co months being from 10,000 to 15,000 men. Dr. Ing. e. h. Brandenburg, Ministerial Dir( Ministry of Transport, dealt with fuels and the use o motor-car and pointed out that the fuel question v vital one in German transport policy. The fuel rec ments for power vehicles in Germany were now 1,4( tons per annum, of which one-third was produced in many; and the important question now arose how qu the German proportion could be increased. In 1933 sumption was not larger than in the preceding although there were 150,000 new registrations ag 95 000 in 1932. It followed that the greater part o new vehicles involved no new demands, but that were being substituted for old and worn-out vehicle was also true that motor vehicles were not being to capacity so long as the fuel was too dear.

((,4 T /yC^' ' OIL NEWS. 63) 391 A PIPE LINE FOR BAHREIN. /?/ From the standard Oil Company of California* Transporting oil cargoes is a routine business. The snips engaged in this prosaic, port-to-port work have little concern with the glamour and romance which often attaches to tramp freighters and passenger vessels that drop anchor in far, exotic harbours. But now and then romance comes aboard an oil-tanker to interrupt the even tenor of its ways. For an interesting example of such deviation from a prescribed course, consider this com pany's tanker &lt;£ El Segundo,' at present engaged in as romantic a bit of voyaging as ever comes the way of a merchant ship. This sturdy steam-tankship, long familiar on the Pacific Coast, has become an expeditionary vessel to the far Per sian Gulf, almost 180 degrees of longitude, or half-way round the earth, from San Francisco. She sailed from San Pedro on December 30, 1933. The expedition is for the purpose of constructing a marine loading-terminal to make available for marketing the newly discovered oil on Bah rein Island, the largest of a group of islands which forms DESCRIPTION OF MAP OPPOSITE. Here is an accurate relief map of Bahrein and the smaller islands of the Bahrein group, prepared by Standard Oil Company of Cali fornia engineers. Shown in white are the gathering lines, the draw bridge, the three tanks, the submarine pipe line—all under construction now. Shown also are the producing wells (solid white), and the drilling wells (circles). Near the hill called Jebel Duhkan, 450 feet above sea level and the highest elevation on Bahrein Island, the drillers first found oil. Here is the camp of the field workers. At the end of the three-mile submarine line is indicated the mooring arrangement for tankers, in 50 feet of water. The tiny mounds scattered over the island are tombs, some 10,000 in number and said to be of Phoenician origin. the • independent State of Bahrein, governed by Sheikh Hamad. In April, 1930, a party of geologists from the home office landed on the island to survey the lands covered by the concession granted by the Sheikh. Follow ing careful surveys, a favourable report was made, and drilling was started in 1931. About a year later the first well ' came in,' and since that time production has been brought to the commercial stage by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California. MARINE LOADING TERMINAL. The construction work of the marine loading-terminal includes laying over three miles of 12-inch submarine pipe line from the small island of Sitrah out into the harbour, terminating in 50 ft. of water; erecting three crude-oil working tanks with floating roofs on Sitrah Island, with a capacity of 250,000 barrels, and a 7,500-barrel tank for ship's ballast water; laying more than ten miles of gather ing-lines from the producing area to the terminal; pro viding a pumping plant with a capacity of 5,700 barrels of oil an hour, housed in a dust-proof building—for ' shamals,' the local sand-storms, sometimes make life in Bahrein somewhat of a burden; installing four sets of radio telephones for communication between ship and shore, and a telephone line connecting with the present line on Bahrein Island; and building a road to the terminal, in cluding a fill or a trestle 1,200 ft; long and a draw-bridge across the channel between the two islands. The relief map indicates the location of the producing area and the pipe line that will transport the crude oil to deep water. These loading facilities will be able to handle 10,000 barrels of oil a day, with^ provision for adding booster pumps to double that daily capacity if greater production is desired. This work will require several months to complete. When the tanker then leaves her anchorage she will be laden with Bahrein crude, taken aboard by means of these new loading facilities, the materials for which she carried across the Pacific. She has a cargo capacity of 39,736 barrels. Where she will deliver the first oil cargo to be taken from this producing field is yet to be determined; She is expected to arrive in San Francisco about Septem ber 1. EXPEDITIONARY OUTFIT. Few merchant ships have ever outfitted as the ' El Segundo' did; her case more nearly parallels that of a ship equipped for an Arctic expedition, for she is far from sources of supplies. Fuel for the round trip and every thing necessary for the subsistence of the 45 men aboard for a period of nine months, were taken at San Francisco, San Pedro, and Bombay. In addition, the craft was loaded with miles of pipe, sheet-steel for tank construction, five 8-ton anchors, six marking buoys, three trucks, a trailer, two tractors, numerous air-compressors, electric-welding generators for the work of welding pipe lines and the bot toms of tanks, a derrick and an unloading platform for landing freight from lighters that operate between ship and shore, and innumerable other items of equipment, tools and materials, the list of which reads like an inven tory of a combination machine-shop and boiler factory. Since tankers have no general cargo holds, openings were cut through the steel deck so that heavy equipment and supplies could be stored in the cargo-tanks. In con nection with handling this material, particularly in Bah rein waters, cargo-booms were added to the ship's masts —incongruous enough aboard a tanker, whose normal cargo is taken on and discharged through hoses. The vessel arrived at Bahrein on February 22, and is now anchored in deep water 16,000 ft. offshore. Here, more than three miles out, the shallow water ends, and it is across this reach of shallow bottom that the loading pipe line will go, its hose-fitted discharging-end marked by a buoy. Radiating from this point the five huge anchors will be placed, their heavy chains attached to marking- buoys. When a tanker arrives for loading she will make fast to these anchors and be securely held in position. Here the ' El Segundo' lies under the torrid sun, the floating home of the engineers, structural workers, divers and others of the personnel during the construction period. A channel 30 miles long is also to be charted and marked for the safe entry of tankers to the harbour.

In the current year this percentage had already increased. As it became possible to reduce the cost of the spirit, the alcohol mixture would more and more take the place of petrol. OIL FROM COAL. Professor Ubbelohde spoke on the subject of obtain ing mineral oil from the distillation of hard and soft coal. He pointed out that Germany is not in a position to cover its requirements of motor fuel, lubricating oils and high way construction materials from domestic sources. These sources consisted of German petroleum, oil produced from hard and soft coal, and alcohol produced by agriculture. In order to increase the supply, it was not possible to increase the capacity of plants now operating so long as certain products of those plants were without a market. For example, too much asphalt and tar was produced relatively to coke residue, which was almost unmarket able. Therefore, instead of burning raw coal in the household, and thus wasting liquid products, distillation coke should be burned in future. The same applied to locomotives and generating stations. There should not be any difficulty in marketing such coke, as for briquet- ting purposes it would serve very well. If the soft coal distilleries now idle were to resume work, the output of mineral oil products would be increased by 200,000 tons per annum. The heavy oils and the pitch could be con verted into lighter oil products almost without residue. Among other speakers may be mentioned Dr. A. Graf, who dealt with the latest development of geophysical apparatus. He drew particular attention to the torsion balance of short-period oscillation known as the S20 of the Askania works. +++ GERMANY: FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROL.

The general meeting of the above association, which was formed early last year under Government auspices, took place in Berlin on April 26. Professor Ubbelohde, the president of the association, presided over a gather ing of more than 1,000 persons, although comparatively few of those were actively engaged, directly or indirectly, in the operations of the association. Government circles took an important part in the proceedings. Two German Ministers, Herr Seldte, Minister of Labour, and Herr von Elz-Rubenach, Minister of Transport, were present, as well as representatives of the German Navy and Army, and Dipl.-Ing.

Professor Ubbelohde, in his opening address, men- tioned the death during the year of the late Alfred Wirth, and all the assembly rose to their feet as a tribute to the deceased, to whom, more than to any other man, the formation of the association was due. Herr Seldte made an appeal to those present to en courage as far as possible the employment of German workers. He also pleaded for the use of the German soil to the utmost possible degree and for the most economic employment of minerals and mineral products. RAW MATERIALS AND THEIR TREATMENT.

IHE BAHEEIN PETEOLEDK OOMPAIIY LIMITED. 19 Moorgate, London, E.G.2 25th May, 1934. Dear Mr, Laithwaite, Mooring Master and Piint p ^ I am now directed by the Company^communicate with you in reply to your letter P.Z. 2^4/34 of the 3bt May in which you state that as regards the Mooring fester the position is that it is regarded as desirable in principle that the consent of the Bahrain Government should be obtained to any appointment of this nature and that Mooring Master and Pilot should be, as stated in your letter (presumably that of the 21st April) subject to the authority of the Bahrain Government's Port Officer and that the Shaikh had been advised accordingly. The Company's Chief Local Representative at Bahrain has also received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, a communication to the effect that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad desires him (the Political Agent) to point out to the Company that the Bahrain Government already have a ^^ ' ^ lor ^ O^fi 0 ^ and that his (presumably the Port Officer's) —- previous consent to the employment of the proposed Mooring Master and Pilot should be asked for. It is assumed this communication results from the advice given to His ■Excellency by His Majesty's Government, The Company entirely fails to understand why such advice should have been given to His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain seeing that the piloting of vessels to the Company's ancorage and the mooring of vessels are matters solely/solely connected with the Company^ own operations of producing oil under its Concession Agreement and that this work of piloting and mooring is work undertaken by the Company's own Official. The Company cannot but feel that there is some misunderstanding of the true position in the minds of the Advisers of His Majesty's Goyernment, particularly as the principle which is sought to be introduced is a new one and directly contrary to the freedom of action accorded to the Company by its Concession Agreement and essential to the successful carrying out of its operations at Bahrain. On the other hand, the creation of reasonable and consistent Harbour Regulations concerning the movements and care ox incoming and outgoing vessels v^ithin the xerritorial 'Waters of His Excellency's Government are, of course, an entirely different matter and one in which the Bahrain Government could.look to the fullest and most lively co-operation of the Company. It seems to the Company that there has, perhaps, been a failure to make clear in the letters I have referred to above that it is these Regulations His Majesty's Government have lin mind and I am asked to request that the matter should be given further consideration by His Majesty's Government and that the Company should receive assurance that interference with its freedom of action in appointing its own Officials is not sought by His Majesty's Government. In conclusion, I think I should tell you that it has been found necessary wherever the Standard Oil Company of California has a submarine loading line, to keep a man on the spot who is familiar not only with the channel but with the technique of placing a boat properly to receive the/- 7} the loading ^ine. This is an intricate matter and requires experience and knowledge of local conditions. The line must 'be picked up without kinking and the hoat must at all times be kept irom driving over the line otherwise it gets torn away, A great deal of care must 'be exercised in letting go of the line and care must be taken to lay it on the bottom without kinking. It is something that can be learned only be experience and mishandling of the situation would cause serious disaster. Yours sincerely, (SD.) H.R.BALLAHTTKE.

Dear Mr.Laithwaite, Mooring Master. This morning's mail 'brings in to me from Mr.Lombard! a long explanation of the real nature of the duties of the st-called Mooring Master at Bahrain and I hasten to let you have an extract which I think will give you a much clearer idea of the position than I have yet 'been able to convey to you. The extract to which I refer reads as follows:- 'Perhaps the nature of the duties to b e performed by the Mooring Master (which term, we think, should properly 'be Mooring Director) in connection with the operation of our submarine loading-line has not 'been made entirely clear to you. In the first place, some misunderstanding as to the nature of the duties may have arisen through the fact that Captain Nelson was originally referred to at timea as 'Harbour Master'. Prom such a designation I can understand how the British Government could easily gain the impression that we desired Captain Nelson to assume some jurisdiction over the harbour itself - which, of course, is not the intention. I There is no desire for Captain Nelson's duties to conflict with any proper governmental functions. I note also that there seems to be an impression that Captain Nelson will serve as a Pilot, in addition to his functions as Mooring Director. It has never been our plan that Captain Nelson should serve as a Pilot in the true sense ^aUhwaite Esq. , IW 0f// India Office. !V .Mi J a3s8pof the word. He will, it is true - if requested - go out to meet the tankers as they come into the terminal, and assist the captains in mooring their ships at the end of the loading line. Were Captain Nelson to take control of the wheel of the ship and act as a Pilot, this would mean the assumption of iesponsibility for the safe conduct of the ship; there has never been any thought on our part that the Mooring Director should assume such responsibility and, consequently, I think it is really a misnomer for him to he classified in any way as a Pilot. I hope you will he ahle to make it clear to the India Office that, in acting as Mooring Director, Captain Nelson will he merely a private employee of The Bahrein Petroleum Company, and that his duties will not partake of a public nature such as would inevitably be the case were he to be a Harbour Master or a Pilot. As I see it. Captain Nelson will really be our Port Captain, looking out for our own individual marine affairs. In his capacity as Mooring Director for the submarine line, it will be his duty to assist the tanker captains in making proper connections between their ships and the hose at tne end of the line. Picking up the hose and making the connection so that damage to the line will be avoided and no oil will be spilled into the water is a job requiring experience on the part of the man handling the operattoi. Also, it requires expert guidance in making the disconnection and placing the hose on bottom without kinking, ready for the next pickup, after the tanker has been loaded. We have found, through our experience in operating other submarine loading-lines on the Pacific Coast and in Mexico, that many tanker captains coming into a submarine loading-terminal for the first time have only a hazy idea of t he accomplishment of the tasks involved in making/3. making the connections and disconnections. It is for this reason that we must have a thoroughly-experienced employee to serve as Mooring Director. Lack of experience and skill in this work will almost inevitably result in damage to the line, failure to make connections with the tankers, and loss of oil. Captain Nelson was picked for this position on account of his long experience under varied conditions; and we have full confidence in his ability to handle the work under any circumstance which may arise. To illustrate the work ?;hich will be done by the Mooring Director, I am enclosing two articles on our submarine line at Estero Bay, in California, which were published in the Bulletin in December 1929 and July 1930. The latter article is particularly in point on Mooring procedure; the first contains a good picture of the end of the hose which is lifted from the water and connected with the tanker. It seems to me that the reply you have suggested is entirely in order - except for your reference to the appointment of Captain Nelson as Pilot. From what I have said above, you will understand that I think the rexerence u o his capacity as Pilot should be eliminated'. I enclose two Bulletins published by the Standard Oil Company of California for December 1929 and July 1930 to which Mr.Lombardi refers and also the Bulletin for June 1933. These will also, I hope, help to an understanding of what a pipe-line and its attendant responsibilities are. Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) H.R.

The secretary of state, in his telegram of the 18th April, No.970, paragraph 3, expressed his entire agreement with you and added that Ballantyne had heen so informed. A note of a conversation with Ballantyne on the subject was sent to you and to Bahrein by the air mail of the 20th April, under our number p.z«2565/34. 2. ihe company (see Ballantyne's letter of the 23rd April, copy sent to you and Bahrein by the air mail of the Hth May) subsequently asked in what circumstances it had been/ Hon'ble Lt.Col.

It appears that there is no suggestion that the ^&gt;, Mooring Master should in any way exercise an independent authority or jurisdiction which might interfere with the authority of the Bahrein Port Officer, but that he will, in fact, be in the strictest sense a servant of the Company, employed on certain technical duties* It is perhaps, in these circumstances, unnecessary to make his appointment formally subject to the consent of the sheikh or formally to provide that he shall be under the control of/&amp; - 3 - of the Port Officer, and if you agree (perhaps you would let me know hy telegram) we will inform the Company accordingly.

Tti 0 United States' production continues on the down ^rade the output for last week, according to the figures of the American Petroleum Institute, averaging 2,492,500 bbls. daily compared with 2,514,050 bbls. in the previous week. While no definite information is as yet forthcoming regarding the Federal Oil Control Bill it is stated that since the introduction of the measure in the Senate the Petroleum Administrative Board has received numerous recommendations for its modifica tion, and a number of these suggestions are to be introduced in the House. It is understood that the Bill will limit the importation of petroleum and its products, including natural asphalt. Prior to the end of 1935 imports will be limited to the average monthly rate of crude petroleum imported during the last half of 1932. The section of the Bill providing for quotas has been altered so that these quotas shall apply only to crude and shall be such as will limit the total movements into commerce to the total demand for consumption in the U.S., and the demand for export. The Bill will probably confine its control entirely to crude petroleum, except in the case of imports. While some features of the proposed legisla tion are not regarded as satisfactory to the industry as a whole there appears to be an increasing number of producers in sup port of the measure, the general opinion being that Federal control of production at the present time is desirable and would do much towards stabilising conditions. It is now, however, felt that unless the session of Congress is consider ably extended beyond June 9, there is no chance of the Oil Bill becoming law. In Oklahoma strikers are now return ing to work and there are indications that the labour difficulty will be satisfactorily settled. Considerable fresh activity .is forecasted in this State and many companies are stated to have acquired additional acreages. The approval of plans for developing an additional 194 new pools, with an estimate probable producing area of about 81,000 acres in ten States has been announced by Mr. Ickes. OIL IN BAHREIN.—Teheran, May 25.—A re-statement of Persia's claim to sovereignty over the Bahrein Islands was made in a reply in the Medjliss to-day by the Foreign Mimster to a question about the Bahrein Oil Concession.

Questions concerning concessions for oil exploitation in the British-protected Bahrein Island have led the Persian Government to revive their claim to sovereignty over the island. Protests have been made to the British Government and a letter has been sent to the United States Minister here, stating that the Persian Govern ment refuse to recognise the concession granted to the Standard Oil Company of California, on the grounds that it was granted without their authority or consent. [On November 26, 1927, the Persian Government put forward a claim to sovereignty over the Island of Bahrein, which Sir Austen Chamberlain, then British Foreign Secretary, declined to recognise in a Note of January 18, 1928. A further Note from the Persian Government on August 2, 1928, was answered by Sir Austen Chamber lain on February 18, 1929, in a Note summarised in the ' Times' of March 2, 1929. A letter to the British Legation in Teheran was cir culated by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on August 26, 1930, among members of the League of Nations, protesting against the granting by the Sheikh of Bahrein of a concession to a British syndicate to exploit the oil of the island.] FIRST SHIPMENT OF CRUDE. The Standard Oil Company of California will start shipping crude oil from its Bahrein Island (Persian Gulf) concession on June 15. The market has not yet been deter mined.

I spoke to Shaikh Kamad and Shaikh 'Abdullah on the morning; of the 23rd May 1934 about measuring oil. I told them briefly, after drawing a picture of an oil tank, that there were two operations involved in measuring oil for the purposes of royalty. Firstly,* that the tanks had to be measured carefully in order to determine the amount that they contained, and secondly, that when the oil was actually being sent into the ships measurements were taken of the level of the oil before and after it was pumped into the ship. Then certain technical oper ations {including an allowance for temperature) were carried out to find out the number of tons shipped. 2. I said that as regards the measuring of the tanks either the Company T s Engineers could do it or that an independent firm of Engineers from London could be asked to do it. The Shaikh said that he would accept whatever advice Government gave him in the matter. I said that I was awaiting a letter from Government which I thought would come by the air mail of today and that when I had received it, I would write to him and explain what the position was. I said that it was for him to cnoose. He said that he thought that the Engineers of the Company could be trusted and I said that it was,ofcourse, in their own interests to have the tanks accurately measured on account of tiieir own sales.

He stayed to ask if there was any objection to his getting in three or four Persian masons to do gutch work,at which the local men are had, in order to hasten the construction of the married quarters. I said that I thought that there was no objection,hut suggested that he shd get the men through the head of his masons, as then any possible awkwardness with the Persian Passport authorities ijould be avoided and he could hold his man responsible that only good workers were got, 2. I took the opportunity of saying that something he (Mr Skinner) had said some days before had beentroubling me as it semed to suggest that he thought that the work of the Company had been obstructed. He admitted that i ^=was=aohe had thought so and I went into various matters with him at some length. I pointed out that the Company had on various occasions made the necessity for sudden requests for facilities ,/which could have been foreseen, and that it must take some time to obtain the best possible advice for the Shaikh. I instanced here the wireless of the 'El Segundo' . Then I pointed out that they had asked,as a right,for things which clearly were not rights under the P.L. and explained that , for good or ill, the agreement had been ■ divided into three parts and fh at they could not expect that they shd have the rights of the Mining Lease when they had not come onto it. He continually went back to a question 'Why was it necessary to bargain,as all they wanted was to help the Sfeaikh by shipping otl 1 ? I explained that acting inafiduciary capacity , we were bound to safeguard the Shaikh's interests,even more meticulously than we would our own. That both the Company and the Shaikh ' wanted changes in the Mining Lease,and that we were therefore bound to pe= note when he gave them something to which they were not at present entitled. I also emphasized that the Company had eeSi been refused Uhthmg for which they had asked and had even been allowed (except in the matter of the wireless) to carry on pending examination of their re quests. XHSXKKSCX The interview was lengthy and involved,hut I thinK that it has cleared the air and I assumed Mr Skinner that there was, I was sure, not the slightest intention to hamper tne Company , hut merely that it was incumhent on us in our position of tru#t , to see that nothing was allowed to pass which might ma.ce us liable to the reproach here- Q-ftGr that we had in the smallest way failed in our duty as trustee. 9.6.34 Chief Local Representative's No: PA-93 of 8th June 1934.

I reminded the Shaikh that they had expressly asked that the Chief Local Representative should be a British subject and said that this seemed to be the most suitable arrangement, as the cost for a special man would be very high. They said that they were very glad to have a British subject in accordance with their Agreement and said that %. Russell knew the place and would be acceptable to them.
