GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. POST AND TELEGRAPH ESTABLISHMENTS. To THE BIGHT HONOURABLE EDWIN MONTAGU, Sis Majesty s Secretary of State for India, Delhi, the 20th November 1919, Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Despatch No. 11 -Telegraph, dated the 11th October 1918, forwarding, for our observations and recommendations, a representation addressed to you by Dr. P. 0. Woollatt of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, regarding bis pay and allowances while holding the appointment of Medical Officer of the South Persia Rifles. 2. As intimated in our telegram No. 2264, dated the 23rd April 1919, we referred the matter to the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, and enclose a copy of the correspondence with him on the subject. The prayers of the Memorialist are dealt with below. ( 1 ) That the charges brought against him be unreservedly withdrawn. These may be summarised as:— (a) Unsatisfactory work, (b) Insubordination, and (c) Refusal to curtail private practice, -y- With regard to this prayer and the charges stated therein, we would in vite your attention to the remarks conveyed in paragraphs 6 to 11 of the letter from the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles No. 540-2-A., dated the 14th May 1919. In view of what is therein stated we are inclined to the opinion that, in spite of previous good service, the attitude adopted by Dr. Woollatt during the latter part of his service was distinctly insubordinate, and that there is nothing which would warrant our ordering the Assistant Director, Medical Services, South Persia Rifles, to withdraw his official statements. ( 2 ) That he be granted some Imperial Decoration or Order. As the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, has definitely decided not to recommend Dr. Woollatt for a decoration, we do not consider that this prayer need be considered further. (3) That he be granted pay as originally sanctioned by the Inspector- General, South Persia Rifles, prior to the 21st May 1917, the date on which he was granted a temporary commission in the Indian Medical Service. As Sir P. Sykes definitely promised that Dr. Woollatt should receive pay at the rate of 300 Tumans a month from the 15th November 1916 to the 20th May 1917, and as the latter was actually paid at that rate during the above III2 W/MHmmmmmma m i b li . period, we recommend that the sum of Es. 7,95i-3-ll overdrawn by him be written off as a special case. (4) That Us pay from the 21st May 1917 be adjusted as for other officers of the Fwce. -.m -, 111 ° Ur - Army t&gt; 0 P artment letter No. 18909, dated the 22nd December 7 teu Sa “ CtlOQ , Was , a “ orfled ' with y° ur approval (vide your telegram dated the 7th November 1917 to the Foreign and Political Department), to the grant to Dr. Woollatt of the temporary rank of Major in the Indian Medical Service and the following emoluments, with effect from the 21st May 1917 : Pay for holding: the appointment of Senior Medical Officer Pars Brigade ...

After careful consideration we are of opinion that the case will smtab y be met if, in addition to the emoluments sanctioned in the Army Department letter quoted above, Dr. Woollatt is paid such local allowance as was admissible to Eield Officers in South Persia. (5) That from the 2ist May 1917 his telegraph pay be augmented to furlough pay as m the case of other officers similarly employed. ) .p As 8 r J ia ^ er 18 under your administrative control we have no remarks to ( offer and would leave the question of. its acceptance or rejection in your hands, e would, however observe that, in view of our recommendations as regards prayer (4) no grounds appear to exist for the grant of any further concessions .

From—-The Director, Medical Services in India, To—The Inspector-General, South Persia Rifle*. I have the honour to forward a petition* to the Right Hon’ble the Secretary With 43 exhibits as per Schedul# attached to Peti- ^ State for India, from Dr. P. C. Woollatt tl0 '’ , , t , t ^ le Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment and lately a temporary Major in the Indian Medical Service, in which he represents the circumstances connected with his pay and position when employed with the South Persia Rifles and concludes with the following prayers : 1 . That the charges brought against him be unreservedly withdrawn. These charges may be summarised as :— (a) Unsatisfactory work. (£) Insubordination. (c) Refusal to curtail private practice. 2 . That he be granted some Imperial Decoration or Order. 3 . That he be granted pay as originally sanctioned by the General Officer Commanding the force prior to date of Commission. 4. That his pay after that date be adjusted as for other officers in the force. 5 That his telegraph allowance be augmented to furlough pay from same Q l 6 * 6 . That he may be re-employed. 7 . That tamay be granted compensation for the heavy expenses incurred 5. That he may be granted the bonus authorised for Temporary Indian Medical Service Officers. H y 9 . That he may be accorded any other relief that may seem suitable. nprtpri W'thrprd to the first p raye L a careful perusal of the documents con- nectea with the case shows that there is not only no adequate proof in substan tiation of the charges in question, but rather there appears to be some conflicting evidence in the matter. For instance, in his letter No. 576 - 5 -A., dated ^ May 1918 to the Adjutant General in India, the Inspector General, Sou’th Persia' Rifles recommended the grant of certain financial concessions to Dr. Wooflatt and referred in commendatory terms to his work. Yet some two or three weeks subsequently, he confirmed the allegations of insubordination and unsatisfactory work made against the Petitioner, and although the question of the latter’s dismissal was then actually proposed, he does not seem to have either withdrawn or modified the recommendattons contained in his letter quoted above. in th e ' circumstances it is requested that this point be carefully considered and either withdrawn. eV ‘ denCe ^ 3 ln SUpP ° rt °‘ the char S es - or that ‘hey may be 3 . As regards the other prayers I request that I may be favoured with an expression of your views on each of them, ^ Ulth anEnclosure No. II. No. 540-2-A., dated Shiraz, the 14th May 1919. From —The Inspector General, South Persia Rifles, To—The Director, Medical Services in India, Simla. In reply to your No. 10207-1 (D.M.S.-i), dated 12th April 1919. I have the honour to return herewith the petition and connected corres pondence regarding Dr. P. C. Woollatt of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, late temporary Major, I.M.S. attached to the South Persia Rifles ; together with a report on those circumstances which are within my personal knowledge. 2. From November 1916 until May 1917 Dr. P. C. Woollatt acted in sole medical charge of the Persian medical establishment of the newly constituted Ears Brigade, South Persia Rifles, and did very good work. Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes agreed to give him the pay he had received from the Swedes for similar work, namely tumans 300 per mensem. Previous to 1916 this was worth about £55 per mensem. In 1917-1918 the rate of exchange made it worth ;£ 100 per mensem. From June 1917 onwards, junior Indian Medical Service officers began to arrive at Shiraz and served under Dr. P. C. Woollatt, after some persuasion by me. 3. Colonel H. Burden, Indian Medical Service, arrived in August 1917, and took up his appointment of Assistant Director, Medical Services to the South Persia Rifles. Difficulties had begun to arise regarding command and discipline, in the Ears Brigade field ambulance, owing to the civilian status of the acting Senior Medical Officer, Dr. P. C. Woollatt. On 14th August 1917, therefore, the Assistant Director, Medical Services recommended the grant to Dr. P.C. Woollatt of the temporary rank of Major, I. M. S. with the pay and allowances of that rank as granted to officers serving in the South Persia Rifles for whole-time duties with the South Persia Rifles, including light duties for the telegraph department for the duration of the war. 4. In November 1917 the Secretary of State sanctioned the temporary rank of Major, I. M. S. with effect from 21st May 1917. and with pay at Rs. 800 consolidated per mensem, plus Rs. 200 for medical charge of employees of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, plus Rs. 100 medical charge of Shiraz Consulate. The total pay of Major P.C. Wollatt, as thus laid down, was Rs. 1,100 per mensem, or about £72 per mensem at the rate of rupee exchange in 1917-1918. 5. The pay and allowances of a Major, I. M. S. serving with the South Persia Rifles (without duty with telegraph or consulate) was approx imately Rs. 1,350 ( = ^90 per mensem). Major P.C. Woollatt, therefore, had a legitimate grievance about loss of emoluments, and his case was represented to Army Headquarters, India but no decision had been received up to April 1918, and Major P C. Woollaft remained unsatisfied. Dealing with his case took up a good deal of the time of the staff, when there was a continuous pressure of work. 6. It may be noted that in April 1918 the rates of pay and allowances for all other British officers and Non-Commissioned Officers attached to the South Persia Rifles had not yet been definitely settled, and orders were still being awaited by all officers on the proposals contained in the South Persia Rifles scheme submitted in August 1917. Other officers were content to wait, but Major P. C. Woollatt pressed constantly for his owm individual case to be settled. It was explained to him that the main case of the South Persia Rifles had been referred Home, that the war in March-April 191P was obviously taking up all spare energies at Home, and Major P. C. Woollatt was asked to be patient. In April 1918, however, Major P. C. Wollatt presented what amounted to an ulti matum to the Assistant Director, Medical Services requesting to be allowed to resign his appointment and his temporary commission, in the event of the question of increased pay not being decided at once.t 15 3 I. The Assistant Director, Medical Services, Colonel Burden, had expressed to Brigadier-General^ Sykes, and to me dissatisfaction (ci) with the administrative arrangements of Major P. C. Woollatt, who was ignorant of official forms and ▼ procedure, (b) that the pay and office routine of Major P. C. WoollatPs unit were frequently in arrears or inaccurately rendered, (» that Major P. C. Woollatt devoted too much time to private practice, (d) that Major P. 0 . Woollatt took insufficient interest in sanitation as practised by military medical officers, and complaining specially about the insanitary state of the surroundings of Major woollatt s own house, in the Telegraph garden. _ S- The differences between the Assistant Director, Medical Services and Major P. C. Woollatt became acute in April 1918, and Major Woollatt asked me (I was then Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster-general and the senior staff officer) for a personal interview with Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes, in the presence of t e Assistant Director, Medical Services. The Deputy Assistant Quartermaster- general and the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General were also present, as both were interested in cases dealing with various features involved. 9 ; The account of this interview, as given by Major P. C. Woollatt, in his Ex mbit No. 30, is not strictly accurate. His attitude was distinctly aggressive and truculent, and his attitude and language to the Assistant''Director, b Medical Services were such that Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes had to check him and tell him not to go too far, but to go away, in his own interests, and consider the matter quietly for 24 hours. Major Hobson, who is still in Shiraz, agrees with this my description of this interview. 10. On the 23rd April 1918, the day after the interview with the General Officer Commanding, Major P. C. Woollatt informed the Assistant Director, Medical Services that he wished to abide by his written request of 19th April, to resign his temporary commission and his appointment as Senior Medical Officer, Pars Brigade. The Assistant Director, Medical Services wired accordingly to India, and the resignation was accepted, and Dr. P. C. Wollatt, left Shiraz a few days later for England. II. After the offer of resignation was accepted and agreed to in India Dr. P. C. Wollatt stated in Shiraz that he had not expected that his resignation would be accepted, thaUie had really only offered it in order to force a decision about his pay, and that it was unfair to him to have taken him so quickly at his word. t 12. The attitude adopted by Major P. C. Woollatt during the latter half of April 1918, was so repugnant to Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes, that he decided not to recommend Dr. P. C. Woollatt for any reward or decoration, although his previous services with the South Persia Rifles might well have justified a recommendation. 13. With regard to the specific points raised in his petition by Dr. P. C. Wollatt— (1) Questions of — (a) unsatisfactory work, (b) insubordination, (c) refusal to curtail private practice, were dealt with departmentally by the Assistant Director, Medical Services, Colonel H. Burden, C.I.E., who has returned recently to India] and is stationed at Quetta. It is requested that he may please be referred to. (2) Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes decided not to recommend any specific reward. (3) Prior to date of commission, the pay of Dr. P. C. Woollatt is recom mended at Tumans 300 per mensem, as promised by Brigadier- General Sir P. M. Sykes.( 4 ) &amp; ( 5 ) During the period of the temporary commission, it is recom mended that Major P. C. Woollatt be paid at the rate cf full pay and allowances of a Major I. M. S., attached to South Persia Rifles, as Senior Medical Officer of a brigade, South Persia Rifles, receiving such additional charge allowances for the extra duties with the Indo-European Telegraph Department and Shiraz Consulate, as may be decided. As an analogous case, at Kirman, these additional charge allowances are Rs. 200 and Rs. 100, respectively. (6) There is no medical appointment vacant in the South Persia Rifles in which Dr. P. C. Woollatt can suitably be employed. (7) It is not known what heavy expenses have been incurred, meriting compensation. Dr. P. C. Woollatt was taken into South Persia Rifles employment at Shiraz in November 1916. He was released from military service at Shiraz in April 1918. As a special con cession, he was allowed free South Persia Rifles transport for his journey from Shiraz to Bandar Abbas. (8) Major P. C. Woollatt drew his outfit allowance, when granted a tem porary commission. It appears reasonable that he be granted the usual bonus payable in like cases. (9) No extraordinary relief appears to be called for.

In a departmental matter it would have been proper for Dr.Woollatt to have addressed his petition I in the first instance to me as the head of his depart ment but as the incidents of which he complains occurred extra-departmentally and I have no direct cognizance of them it seeme^Yight that he should address the Secretary of State.

The question is gone into in detail in the correspondence, a copy of which is being sent you. I feel bound in honour to press that Dr Woollatt should be given the pay agreed upon by me and I shall be grateful if you would see it through. The work he had to do was enormous, as everything had to be re-organized and his services in the early days were valuable from a political as well as a medical point of view. Lately his attitude has not been satisfactory and he finally insisted upon resigning. He was strongly advised not to do so, pending the receipt of final orders about his case, but he refused to withdraw from his position and his resigna tion was accepted. He has subsequently stated that he did not wish to be taken at his written word. Probably you know him. I hope that you are keeping fit.

I attach a copy of a telegram dated 1st May from the Director at Teheran from which it will be seen that Sir P.Sykes desires the removal of Dr.P.Woollatt from Shiraz in the interests of Government, Dr.Woollatt having behaved in an insubordinate manner to Sir P.Sykes. It will be recollected that Dr.Woollatt was, at Sir P. Sykes ; instance, recently granted a temporary commission in the Indian Medical Service by the Government of India and,in the absence of information as to whether Dr.Woollatt’s resignation has been accepted by Sir P.Sykes with the knowledge and consent of the Government of thL India,it seems doubtful whether the latter had.power ' ft to return him to this Department without the consent of that Government. I am not therefore sure whether I should without it,be in order in accepting jurisdiction over Dr.Woollatt. I suggest therefore that the Government of India might be asked whether Sir P.Sykes’ action has their approval and if so whether Dr.Woollatt’s services may be considered to have been replaced at the disposal of this Department. if they agree / 1 propose to transfer Dr.Woollatt to Ispahan pending the receipt of Sir P.Sykes’ report and of Dr.Woollatt’s explanation. 22274 I 563 1000 5/17Copy of a telegram dated 1st May, 1918, from the Director, Persian Section, to the Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department, London.

Sit Department. Percy Sykes has represented that Dn Woollatt was in receipt of 300 tomans per mensem when the Persian Gendar merie was officered by the Swedes, that he is now in medical charge of some 3,000 men and that his 11 years’ experience of Shiraz and his close con* nection with and knowledge of the gendarmerie make his services invaluable. He therefore considers it hard that Dr. Woollatt should lose through the j force being taken over by the British Government, and he recommends that Dr. Woollatt should be granted the terms given him by the Swedes for a period of 7 years with effect from the 15th November 1916. We consider that no justification exists for the engagement of Dr. Woollatt for 7 years on the terms proposed by Sir Percy Sykes. At the time that the allowance of Es. 200 was sanctioned Sir Percy Sykes intimated that Dr. Woollatt was in sole charge of about 2,000 men. It now appears he is in sole charse of some 3,000 men and in view of this increase we consider that his allowance should be Es. 300 per mensem with effect from the 15th November 1916, the date on which he assumed medical charge of the South Persia Eifles, and while he remains in sole charge of the South Persia Eifles at Shiraz.

It has occurred to me when reading over the last Persian print which you sent over', that the absence of a special officer for accounts and general financial and admin istrative work of that kind must be a great handicap to Sir P. Sykes. The Swedes relieved their executive officers of that work, and left them free for training and operations. In this connection I would suggest that we might utilise the services of a Mr. P.G.T. Nelson, of the Imperial Bank of Persia. He has been to see me several times , and is very anxious to serve under Sykes whom he knows and by whom he is known. Sir Arthur Hirtzel also knows Mr. Nelson, I believe. experience of Persia, of which he spent A in Kerman, and 3 i* 1 Bushire . He ha s also been at Teheran, Ahwaz and Seistan. He knows the language well. Even if, owing to his lack of military knowledge , he were not at first an ideal Quarter Master General for the force , hec , ux£ e -'l' J. ff£ would at any rate be another virhite man with much local experience, and valuable as such. He comes under a different category from the young officers we placed at your disposal , as he is of course not under our orders , but I suggest you might wetl adopt the same procedure in his case as in the other , and inform the G-overnment of India that Nelson is being sent out, unless you hear to the 'X' contrary.'' The Government of India ’would gladly accept the fait accompli, (-with a sigh at the expense). I would suggest that Nelson being 35 years of age and con siderably senior to the other lads in the Bank Service , might perhaps be given temporary rank as Captain in the I.A.R.O. I enclose some correspondence in regard to Mr. Nelson , which please return. Yours sincerely, lo fr.o.Telegram from Viceroy, Foreigi.
