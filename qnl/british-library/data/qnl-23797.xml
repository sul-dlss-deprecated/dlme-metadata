I replied that 1 had not yet heard anything from the S.N.O. about it. Then he * sent me the telegram (S.N.92) in original, he was referring to. as the down steamer wa.s said to have been delayed by one day and there were 2 Hangoons in the port, I thought it advisable if I had arranged the despatch of the Shaikh by Rangoons instead of down steamer and so I talked over the matter with the Group Captain ’Soul* who agreed to take the Shaikh, his young son and 2 others tomorrow at 7.A.M. and drop them at Dubai. I then took H.M. with me and went to Moharraq wnere I met the Shaikh and intimated him of the arrival of ’Hawkins* at Sharjah on 2nd November instead of 18th and that at this occasion his presence was required by S.N.O. and that I had arranged his despatch by the Rangoons. He expressed his inability to return as he has come to congult the doctors and visit the Shaiisj^. I came back and issued S.N.93 to the S.N.O. and also informed the R.A.P. people that Shaikh was not going witn them. 30/10/53.♦ Jf4c.pO Telegram G.
