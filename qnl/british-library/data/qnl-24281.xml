U.E7~- Stt P / © i _suit s pending bef ore the Senior Jo int Court: !• ouit No.4 6/47: The plaintiff in this suit claims P^.800/- on account of the balance of,the cost of a car sold by him to the defendant. The defendant's arguments are that owing to some parts of the car having been missing he sent his brother nbdulla bin Muhammad to reason with the plaihtiff to accept back the car but that the plaintiff agreed to waive the Ps.BCC/- and so he retained the car. The court has postponed the case for he-ring the evidence of Abdulla bin Muhammad, brother of the defendant. 2* Suit..Notl.73^45: This suit was filed on the 29/12/45 by Muhammad bin Rashid al-Mihri on behalf of his client Salih bin Mubarak, a .atar^subject against one Ali bin Abdullah bin Ali bin Rashid, a Bahrain subject, for D s.llOO/- cost of pearls. It was - once heard on the 16/1/46, but in view of some political points, it was postponed indefinitely. These political points, though not recorded in the proceedings of the case, are as I knew them from my precessor, that H.H. made the suggestion not to deal with cases in which ^atar subjects are involved until after the settlement of Bahrain-Qatar dispute, to which j the then P.A. (Col. A.C. Galloway) agreed. claims Rs.825/- alleged to h a ve been advanced by him to the defendant on condition that the latter would sell him 1500 lbs. of tea at Ps.7/8/- first agreed to but later deduced to Rs.7/- per pound. The case was referred to the Majlis Ut-Tijarah where it was dismissed after it had been proved to them that the plaintiff failed to pay the outstanding balance of the cost and collect the tea within the stipulated period, i.e. 20 days from the date of the transaction. The transaction was * performed in the month of Muharram 1366. The case is now to to go/the Senior Joint Court for confirmation of the Majlis' opinion. 3. Suit No.48/47 ? The story of this case is that the plaintiff A^lPilt_i-Qu—Suit bo.3 1/4o♦ The decree—holder in this suit aoplies for recovery of ft.294 and 2 tolas gold due to him as per a decree in his possession. The Judgement-debtor was lastsummonsd on the 5/3/47, but he was reported to have been in Has Tannurah (Arabia) and so the suit was adjourned pending another session of the Court. Appeal No.16/4 6: This is an appeal preferred against the order of the Junior Joint Court in suit Wo.164/46. The facts of the case are that the plaintiff (Fatimah bint Yaqub) had rented a piece of land from the Bahrain Government and built two Barasti, one kitchen and walling (all made of Sa'af) on the land. These together with the land she Inter released to one Muhammad bin All bin Sinin and his wife Hisa bint Muhammad, Bahrain subjects. After an elapse of some time, the defendants rented the land directly from the Government; hence the original lease between the t plaintiff and the defendants became null and void. Fop—this reason the plaintiff wanted to remove the Sa'af house she had built on the land but the defendants objected to this on the ground that they had bought the Sa'af building from the plaintiff. The defendants produced three witnesses before the Junior Joint Court; but none of them gave such evidence as to suggest that the plaintiff had in reality sold the Sa’af building to the defendants. Having failed to prove their contention that they had bought the building, the defendants demanded an oath from the plaintiff, and the case was therefore sent to the Shara for the oath of the plaintiff. Before the Shara' court, the agent of the defendants refused to accept the plaintiff's taking oath and maintained that he had witnesses whereby he could prove his clients' claim to the ownership Of the house. Later when the rfefendartts' agent appeared before the Junior Joint Court he pleaded that his clients had not understood the court's order and were of the idea that the oath was required from the defendants. The Junior Joint Court was not prepared to accept this plea which was not based on sound grounds and decreed that the defendants should return the Sa'af building to the plaintiff. Appeal . N o .1 of 1947j Th i sis an appeal against the orderof the Junior Joint Court in civil suit No.44 of 1947. This • suit was originally instituted in the I.AJs court but having transpired that one of the defendants involved was Bahraini, it was transferred to the J.J.Court. The story of the suit is that on 1/7/1354 the plaintiff sold his share (two thirds) of a shop situated in Manama bazaar for Rs.^400/- to the defendant. The sale was conditional i.e. liable to redemption within two years, beginning from the date of the sale document &gt; and ending by the end of Jamadah Athani, 1356. According to /.produced in the I.A’s court it is evident that the plaintiff wanted to redeem the shop tfnd take back the document and the title-deed from the defendant before the expiry of the period, but the defendant refused to receive payment on the ground that he had bought the shop for good. In doing so, he relied on the contention that had he not bought the shop frojK the plaintiff would have filed a suit against him earlier for the redemption of the shop. The second contention the defendants exerts is that he has not been paying rent all this time. expiry of the period’ specified in the document but the defendant had refused to accept the payment on the score of his : having bought the shop, a fact which, in the opinion of the J.J. Court, is not supported by any strong proof, and therefore 1 who should hand over the document (sale docum* nt) and the title-deed to the plaintiff. The Junior Coint Court was convinced that the plaintiff had endeavered to make payment to the defendant before the ordered the plaintiff to pay the sum of ' .400/- to the defendantAjkk'Ji j\j * \ T t '\ Ch»»’jO n ^ ^ »*w ^ 4Y It ■&lt;«&lt;«/&gt; ^ # ^ J1 ^lo&gt;U^u* 'Jnm* '' j ^ t W*r&gt; ju^ 1 »%&gt;**» Jl Lr^ JljN^. t«J] ■ tiffy ^rc*—J? ^ T* V\ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ A Hr^sj;^ I ^rf ^ J^'* ^ 1^&gt;1 Lm^ 1 wy IM .? «jl v: L-^V i 4^1 1 .&lt;M&gt;»' I •d-J J ^‘jytin»*« «3 ^»%Arrivl ^&gt;Li»».^ -&lt;-.

Usual Ending.SUMMARY Ot' 1 CAocio AvVaITIKG jI ofOJ.iL 3Y THri 1:- Suit Ho.127/1946: This suit originally, instituted for Rs.2200/- on account of cost of skins jettisoned has been settled by the Malis-ut- « Tijarah for Rs.300/- to be paid by the defendant, Abdullah bin Isa bin Jasim / to the Plaintiff in full settlement of the claim* £ t- ...£u:U According to the Ja'fari Shara's report the parties have agreed to a compromise whereby the defendant has already paid Rs.750/- to the plaintiff and will pay the remaining Rs.350/- in ^ two days’ time. In this suit the plaintiff, Ratilal Bagwanji claims » Rs.870/- on account of jewellary bought by the defendant, Abdullah bin Rashid Az-Zayyani. At the first hearing of the case which was taken up on the 7th June, the plaintiff appeared and asked for 2 weeks’ adjournement on the ground that the defendant was making an attempt through the mediation of Haji Yusuf Fakhru to settle the case amicably. 4:- Appeal Ho..2__Qf The story of the original case is that the plaintiff, Ahmad bin Ahmad Bu Assaf, filed a claim against Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Ghirair for Rj. 134/- v alleged to be his wages for 2 months and 7 days during which he worked in a garden belonging to Sharifah Ad-Doy. His ground for suing Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Ghirair is that he was the person who engaged him. The defendant admits that he engaged him and 2 other persons, but contends that he discharged^them all after 23 days after paying them their wages. The suit was finally decreed exparte by the J.J.C. in favour of the plaintiff owing to the failure of the defendant to appear at the last hearing of the case. Translation of the proceedings of the lower Court is attached to the translation of the memorandum of appeal. P.f..1.942 : - ^ This is an appeal A the Junior Joint Court's order in a suit regarding boundary dispute. The story of the case as is-apparent from the original case is that the.plaintiff Khalid Al-Mishari bought a piece of garden from one Abdur Rahman bin — Isa bin Dirbas who inherited this piece from his father. The defendant, ^ashid bin Isa, who is a co-heir and who acquired the other piece tn the same way wished to ha v e his peice registered in the Land department and so when the Land Department's surveyor went to carry out the survey, the plaintiff raised th« objection to the demarkation line and filed a suit in the J.J.C, who decided the case in his favour. The defendant (now appellant) is not satisfied with the decision of the J.J.C. alleging that the court based its decision on evidence of witnesses not intimately acquainted with the pesition anu requests that the commission which was appointed to deal with the division of the inheritance be called upon to give their views. Translation o'f the proceedings of the lower court is attached to the translation of the memorandum of appeal. 6:- Appeal^ Do, 7 of 1945s 'Muhammad .bin Salman bin Khamis, a subject of Dubai, bought one tnird of a house situated in ttuharraq from one hi^isah bint Ahmaa Al-haaaad, who inherited it from her father. The defendant Muhammad bin Ahmad Al-Haddad who was the inheritor | of the other two thirds of the house raised objection to the sale on the ground that being a partner he had the right of pre-emption. The Junior Joint Court by which the case was preliminarily heard referred the case to Ja ! fari Shara' Court for decision on the question of right of pre-emption. The Shara court, after hearing the case several times, awarded that'the defendant, Muhammad bin Ahmad had no right to pre- / 'emption. The J.J.C., therefore, decided the case, giving the plaintiff, Muhammad bin Salman bin Khamis possession of the one third bought by him. The defendant was not satisfied with the decision of the lower court and so he filed a petition of appedl in the Senior JCoint Court, before which he contended that foreigners are not entitled to acquire immovable property in Bahrain other than those meant for residential purposes. This contentionwas refuted as all foreigngers with the exception of Persians are allowed to acquire any number of property in Bahrain, So far the case was heard and it has since been pending.DEPARTMENT/OFFICE.
