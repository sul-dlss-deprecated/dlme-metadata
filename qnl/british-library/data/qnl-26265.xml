O 4 £3rd November, 1932, Purchase of aircraft by Sheikh Kaf, I have the honour to refer to Air Ministry letter 133891/31, dated 1st November, 1932, on the subject of the purchase of an aircraft by Sheikh A1 Xaf of the Hadhramaut. I have just returned from a visit to Terim in the Hadhramaut where I had an opportunity of discussing with Sheikh A1 Xaf the general question of the purchase of the aircraft, and gave him details of the radius of action, load, etc., of the Je Havilland Fox Moth, I am inclined to think, however, that the Sheikh has momentarily, at least, rather abandoned the idea of acquiring an aeroplane. When making his suggestion in the first instance he had not appreciated the maintenance problem, although there are some 70 motor cars in the Hadhramaut, these cars are not maintained, and are allowed to run on until a breakdown occurs. Shaikh A1 Xaf now appreciates that the same method cannot be adopted with an aeroplane, and consequently his enthusiasm is waning. He has not, however, entirely abandoned the idea, and is, in fact, proceeding with the construction of a landing ground just outside the walls of his town, 3, Squadron leader Rickards will be returning to the Hadhramaut in about six weeks’ time, and will then broach the subject again, and try to discover what Sheikh AI Kaf has finally decided upon.

I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to Colonial Office letter of 16th ultiret, 59290/1928, and enclosures on the above subject, and to state for the information of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that they note that Sayed Bubaker bin Sheikh el Koff desires to purchase an aeroplane with seating capacity for at least ten passengers to be used on the proposed air services in the Hadramaut and asks to be furnished with full details including the cost of suitable machines of this type . In the Council’s opinion the De Havilland 66 (’’Hercules”), fitted with three 450 h.p. bristol ”Jupiter” engines and having accommodation for twelve passengers in addition to the pilot is the most suitable aircraft for the work in view. The De Haviiland 'Hercules” was specially designed for use in hot climates and Imperial Airways Limited have operated five aircraft of this type on their Cairo-Basra air service for the past eighteen months with almost 100% efficiency. A complete specification, together with a tender submitted by the De Havilland aircraft Company Limited is enclosed herewith, from which it will be seen that the price of an aircraft of this type ”ex works” is £14,850. I The Under Secretary of State Uolonial Office, S.W.i.I am to request that, subject to Mr.Amery’s concurrence, the acting Political Resident at Aden may be asked to forward and recommend the enclosed O tender to the Sultan Saleh. As regards the question of personnel for the air service 1 am to say that the Council have ascertained that Plying Officer l.M.Morris, an ex-officer of the Royal Air Force, would be willing f to serve as pilot providing that satisfactory terms can . be arranged. This officer has had considerable flying • experience amounting to nearly 1,000 hours on various types of machines (including flying in the Rast) and is considered to be well iioted for the post. I The salary he suggests is £800 per annum if free quarters are provided for him in the Hadramaut and | £1,000 per annum if he has to find his own accommoda tion there. It is understood .however, that he would be prepared to accept a somewhat lower figure if necessary. The Council are taking steps to find a suitable mechanic who would be prepared to serve in the Hadramaut and a further communication on this point will be made to you in due course.

After Compliments, In reply to your letter No.C.192 dated the 4th April 1928, we inform you, oh friend, that we want to buy new aeroplanees of the recent pattern each carrying at least. 10 passengers for carrying passengers between our ports and Hadramaut. Each plane should have two propellers. If one is damaged the other will be able to continue the journey. We prefer that the plane should be of metal make. 2. Please let us have detailed description of such planes and their cost. We flew in one of British planes of two propellers in Cairo which carried 20 men. It is of Wicker make. » r e admired flying in her very much. Kindly let us know what is the cost of such a plane. 3. As Sayed Abdul Rehn&amp;n SI Kaf is the one who wants to arrange for a Company to undertake this work and to purchase mercantile planes, we request you kindly to let us have full description of the planes and send a reply to this n etter direct to us, in order that communication between us and the above Sayed who lives now in Singapore may be made easily.I : CmFlD^'TlAL No .232 .
