Cji GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN- ^ From, The Adviser, Bahrain Governme: To, H« B. M * s Political Agent, Bahrair^s, 1935. Sir, I much regret to inform you that this morning sixty six people were killed and about fifty people were injured, some of them seriously,at the house of Mohammed Tayeb Kiiunji, a Persian ( Sunni ) merchant of Manama. Most of the people concerned were women. 2. -— A crov/d of about two thousand persons from Budeya, Iledd and Rafaa, as well as from Manama and Muharraq, collected at the house of Mohammed Tayeb this morning hearing that he was going to give alms to the poor. There was no organisation and crowds of people pressed in through the main door and filled the compound. Between the door and the compound there is a narrow passage about fifteen feet long. One of Mohammed Tayeb ! s sons, seeing that the compound and the passage were full and people were pushing eachother about, went outside the door, in the road, and called out that the money would be distributed in another building across the street. People inside heard this and began to surge out through the passage. It seems that someone else at the same time gave orders ior bne outer door to be shut to prevent more people coming in. The door, which opened inwards, was shut and locked. The narrow passage 1 was filled with a solid mass of people and others, from the compound, forced their way into the passage. There was no air and no light. As more people crowded in those inside were forced against the door, they struggled and fought and were forced down to the ground and trampled on bythe incoming crowds. There were about two hundred people in the passage. An eyewitness described them as being heaped one on top of the other four deep like bags of rice. Some of them were old and there were children among them. For a long time it was impossible to enter the passage or to move anyoody but eventually people were sent to neighbouring houses to get ropes and crow bars and then the door was. smashed open. When this was done it was possible to carry out the people, but most of them were dead. The greater proportion died from suffocation. Wnen I arrived the bodies were being taken out and spread in the road and in the compound of the house. Unfortunately all the Police and naturs were occupied with the Muharram procession. For s some time it was impossible to do much to relieve the people who needed attention, there were crowds outside and inside the house.^ Eventually the people were cleared out and some of the Police arrived. Dr Holmes and the two Mission doctors dealt with the cases. Some of the staff of the Bahrain Petroleum Company who happened to be in the neighbourhood came and helped with the rescue work and produced two motor lorries on which bodies and injured people were carried to the hospital. These gentlemen were of very great assistance. 5. I do not think that anyone v/as uirectly to blame for the disaster,it was entirely owing to lack of arganisation. Two days ago Mohammed Tayeb 1 s son asked his father not to distribute alms in this way but Mohammed Tayeb refused to make other arrangements. Two years ago there was a similar incident in the same house but there were no deaths and nobody was seriously injured.I iKp GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. 6 Six of the victims were Shia ana the rest were Sunni. In the afternoon when the victims were being buried in the Sunni cemetery there was a demonstration by a large crowd of Shias who jeered at the mourners and cried out that this was the vengeance of Hussein, The Shias have for some time resented Mohammed TayeVs habit of giving alms on what is to tnem a day of mourning. I think that a public enquiry should be held in order to check the rumours which will undoubtedly be spread about the matter not only in Bahrain but abroad. The owner of the house is a foreigner and many of the victims are foreign subjects. It might be advisable to appoint a mixed committee to examine and report on the affair. 7 I have the honour to be Sir Your obedient servant Adviser to the Bahrain GovernmentGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. Dear Cole, Herewith a note on today’s affair. It explains the facts as far as I have oeen able to find out. Do you approve of my sending the following to Times, I think it would be a good thing to have the facts published as otherwise there will be a lot of distortion in the local press.
