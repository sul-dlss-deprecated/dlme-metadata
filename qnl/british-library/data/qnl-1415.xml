From, His Highness Meah Khodadad Khan, To, Khan of Khelat and Beloochistan. Sir W. L. Merewether, k. c. s. i. &amp; c. b. Commissioner in Sind. Khelat, 16th July 1870. After salutations—Yon, my friend, are well acquainted with matters relating to this country from the commencement to the present time. Two or three Brahoees by their evil fate acted in a treacherous and rebellious manner.but by the blessing of God, tlielr efforts were in vain. One rebel fled to English territory and is now settled there. The other two fled to Kandahar. I heard that the relatives of the latter, residing at Seebee, were corresponding, and that some Murrees who belong to that ill-behaved tribe had been sent by Captain Sandeman, the Deputy Commissioner of Dhera Ghazee Khan, to Sirdar Moolah Mahomed's sons, com forting them, promising to enquire into their case, and to give them assistance, and had sent verbal messages by Shaban Murree to be repeated to Sirdar Moolah Mahomed. I feel convinced of the friendship of the English Government towards myself, as they have always treated me in the kindest manner. How, therefore,could Officers without the permission of their Government enter into correspondence with my rebel Chiefs, in such a manner as would probably lead to another rebellion in my country. I did not believe it; lest however reports of this kind should create distrust in the minds of my Sirdars and people, I wrote to my Naibs at Dadur and Shawl to make every enquiry. Some time ago Wuzeer Khan Raisanee committed four murders, and I issued instruc tions that he was to be apprehended, if possible. He fled to Kandahar. On the 15th in stant I received a report from the Naib of Quettah saying, that he had apprehended Wu zeer Khan and Aitibur Khan, as they were passing through, and that on searching them, they found several letters, which they forwarded for my information. I have kept copies for my office and send you the originals ; amongst them the answer to Captain Sandeman's letter and messages. From their perusal you will understand all the circumstances of the case. Alijah —My brother Nusseer Khan always considered himself as under the protection of the English Government, and that by their prosperity, his country and people were theirs. I am also of this opinion, and am aware that it is the wish of the English Govern ment that there should be peace and quiet amongst my people and in my country. How then has Captain Sandeman entered into communications with these turbulent Chiefs, and promised them aid without consulting me. I would also wish to bring to your notice that, whilst Captain Sandeman was in the Murree hills, making arrangements with that tribe, they descended into the plains of Cutchee, and on the 3rd plundered the village of Poolajee, killed fifteen men, and carried off their cattle and flocks. As you have always been a friend to me, I hope that you will represent what has occurred to your Government, and that they will forbid Captain Sandeman's interference with my subjects, either by assistance or promises ; if this is done, I am certain that there will be peace and quiet in my country. Captain Sandeman's arrangements that Kafilas should go direct to Dhera Ghazeo Khan from Kandahar will be most injurious to me as regards revenue. Wuzeer Khan is a prisoner, and after a fair trial, will be punished for the murders he has committed—Salutations, &amp;c. (True Copy) C. W. HARKISON, Captain, Political Superintendent, Khelat and Beloochistan.From, B. Sirdar Moolah Mahomed Easianee, Sirdar Noordeen Mingul, Sirdar Mahomed Khan Roostumzai, Ala Dad Khan, son of Mahomed Iloossein, and Aitibur Giranee. To, Captain Sandeman, Deputy Commissioner, Dhera Ghazee Khan. Kandahar, 10th July 1870. After salutations —The letter you sent to my sons, Azeedoola Khan and Mehroola Khan, by Shahan Murree, has been duly forwarded to me. I have been informed of the verbal messages given to Shahan. You Sahib ask how it is, that Khodadad Khan has not settled our disputes—' Chreisher of the Poor,' the statement is as follows :—After Shore Dil was murdered, we Sirdars administered an oath to His Highness Khodadad Khan, and rein stated him, appointing Wullee Mahomed his Shagassee. Before Khodadad Khan had been deposed, at the recommendation of the Sirdars, General Jacob appointed Wullee Mahomed Shagassee, with this hope that there would be a trusty medium of communication between the Khan and ourselves. No sooner was he appointed, than he acted in a treacherous and underhand manner towards us, and by false representations estranged the Khan from us, and did not attempt to disguise his enmitv. When we saw the policy that had been adopted, we spoke to the Khan, and requested that Wullee Mahomed should be removed, and that another Wuzeer should be appointed, who would consult both interests. His Highness having appointed Wullee Mahomed, imprisoned Taj Mahomed, the Julawau Chief; directly he heard this, he fled to Kandahar. At the recommendation of Wullee Mahomed, His Highness put Sirdar Taj Mahomed to death. The Khan showed that he was regardless of all the oaths he had taken, so we lost all confidence and were afraid ; those who acknowledged the Khan's supremacy, remained in the country. They were not left in peace, for Wullee Mahomed began to interfere with their lands and possessions, they were reduced to great straits, although they had remained obedient to the Khan. At last they were so oppressed, that they wrote to us at Kandahar, and asked us to come down, as in the course of a month they intended laying the whole of their grievances before the English Government (Cherisher of the Poor), and could not reach the rendezvous, as His Highness had collected a force and marched into the Sarawan country. When I failed in joining them, I had intended proceeding to you, but Shagassee Wullee Mahomed followed me with a force. What happened, you are so well acquainted with, that tlyere is no use entering into details on the present occasion. I then joined the Murrees, hoping by their means to offer some resistance. Colonel Sir Henry Green then wrote me a letter, telling me to come with a few followers, that he would send for Wullee Mahomed and make arrangements for me. I believed in your Government, and went at once to Jacobabad. A great deal of conversation took place between the Sahib, Wullee Mahomed and myself. ■Ano satisfactory arrangement was made, so Green Sahib spoke as follows :—Go and remain quietly in your own country, in the cold season His Highness will come into the plains and arrangements will then be made for you. ' Cherisher of the Poor' —Agreeably to Sir Henry Green's wishes, I gave up all my own intentions and settled in my own country. Before he could act in the matter, he had to go home, and was succeeded by Colonel Phayre. About this time a dispute took place between the Jam of Beyla, Sirdar Noordeen, and His Highness the Khan of Khelat. They wrote to me, requesting that I would raise the Sarawan country, and join them, as they intended to fight, ' His Highness being the enemy of all their race,' and that they had no other remedy except fighting. I sent all their letters to Colonel Phayre, and informed him that the Jalawans were assembled at Bhagwanah, and that I was not only awaiting his instructions, but prepared to obey them. Colonel Phayre answered to the following effect:—'that I had better try to extinguish this fire, and put an end to the dispute, and that if I succeeded, I should have the approbation of the English Government.' I at once sent some of my people, and told them to stop ; they complied with my wishes, and made arrangements with His Highness. The Khan returned to Khelat, ignored his treaty, and denied having made any arrangements. Colonel Phayre then sent a letter desiring my presence. I then went to Jacobabad with a few Sowars, and conversed with him at considerable length, stating that His Highness had not come to Cutchee as agreed upon, that our personal efforts had been in vain, as His Highness ignored all that had been done. Nawab Mahomed Khan and I had several disputes on this subject. Colonel Phayre then suggested that I should go with a few Sowars to Beyla, and persuade the Jam, Sirdars Noordeen, Azad Khan, and others, to meet Captain Harrison, the newly appointed Poli tical Agent at Beyla, that Captain Harrison would hear what they had to say, and proceed to Khelat, with the view of making satisfactory arrangements for them with His Highness. Having received a letter to this effect from Colonel Phayre, I proceeded to Beyla and sent for Azad Khan from Kharun. Having collected all the Sirdars, and joined Captain Harri- * To what extent. sou a t Baghwanah, after this Captain Harrison march- C. W. H. e( i on Khelat, stating that he would make arrange ments * for us. We marched to Zehree, and as none of us had the slightest confidence in ^ 4 qqq the Khan, each Sirdar had his own retainers, f ' C. W. H. Captain Harrison wrote to us from Khelat, suggesting that we should only come with a sriven number * of followers, and make our salaams to * 300. C. W. H. His Highness. We replied as follows ;—That we could not trust ourselves with so few followers, that we proposed leaving Zehree and coming nearer to him, so as to have some conversation, after this we made our march. Captain Harrison then sent a Sowar with a letter saying, that if we were coming, we must only bring a few followers,'f* t 300. that if we all came, we mu&amp;t understand that he should C W H have to oppose us. After this, we replied that we did not feel equal to fighting him,and that we had committed no offence against the English Govern ment to induce him to drive us away. That all Belooch considered themselves subjects of the English Government, and to drive away the people of Khorasan without any hope, and to say what he (Captain Harrison) had said, was not worthy of his Government, ihat we ought to discriminate between truth and falsehood, and act accordingly, so that no one should be injured. We also intimated that we intended to march on Nohejo Cupotee, fur this reason, that we had neither grain or grass, and should be nearer to him.' Cherisher of the poor —'When we arrived at Cupotee,Captain Harrison met us and asked why wo had come, and if it was our intention to fight the Khan ; that if we wished to go to Khelat to make our salaam, we had better only take a few people, and allow the rest of our followers to go to their respective homes. We replied that we had not sufficient confidence to go with a few followers, and wanted to know how we were to return.. That the Khan had separated himself from us, as he had previously done, that the English Government were over all, and that Captain Harrison ought to discern truth from falsehood, and give each person nis due, and that if he could not do this, to have the kindness to go to his camp, and that we would quickly arrange our differences. Captain Harrison replied, that as we were so anxious to fight, we had better fight him. I replied, that we did not wish to fight the English Government. Captain Harrison then suggested that I should return to Khelat with him, and arrange mattcis ; that if nothing was settled, he would see me back again to our camp Sir, I went to Khelat with Captain Harrison, and had an interview with His Highness in that Officer's presence. The Khan would not agree to a single thing that I said, refusing to give up property, the lands he had given, or blood money,—in fact, he positively refused to give anything. Captain Harrison approved of all the Khan said. What one said, the other said. Seeing that Captain Harrison was prepared to sacrifice the welfare of ] 00,000 people to please His Highness, I took my departure. On the following day Captain Harrison joined us, and told us we had the option of three things : 1st. To come with a few followers to make our salaam to His Highness, and accept what he would concede. 2nd. That if we would not make our salaam, every one must go to his own place. 3rd. That if fighting was our intention, we had better first fight with him. W e leplied, that we were not equal to fighting the English Government, and that we had not sufficient confidence in the Khan to make our salaam ; also that making arrange- ments, in which we had no confidence, was simply injurious. We agreed to return, if Captain Harrison would give us a letter saying, that the Khan would not hurt us. This we received to the following effect:—All you Sirdars go to your respective homes, and that if you respect the Khan s property and country, no one will injure you. Sir, being helpless, we took this pass and returned to our respective homes. We however consulted together and agreed that by keeping together, there was less chance of our being defeated, if we were attacked. We had great confidence in Captain Harrison's letter, knowing that no English Officer would write what was untrue, besides this, we had great trust in Colonel Phayre, as he had shown us the greatest kindness. I then directed all the Sirdars to go to their respective hom3s, and that I would go and report what had occurred to Colonel Phayre. Not being acquainted with English habits, I proceeded towards Jacobabad, but was met by Nawab Mahomed Khan and Colonel Phayre's Moonshee, who told me that the rules of the service prevented Colonel Phayre seeing me, and that any arrangements I had to make, must be made through Captain Harrison, and that we had better go to our respective homes. Agree ably to this instruction, I went to my own place and wrote a letter, which I sent to Captain Harrison ; he refused to receive it, and distinctly told my messenger that the En glish Government would not interfere further. I then, trusting in God, remained in my own country. Thinking that an English Officer being at Khelat, His Highness would be prevent ed from making any attacks on us. Captain Harrison had not reached Mustoong, when His Highness assembled a force, and without the slightest intimation attacked Wud. I placed gieat icliance in Captain Harrison s letter ; not being able to reach my friends, I sought pro tection in tho Murree hills, bhagassee W ullee Mahomed, b}* acting so quietly, got the victory.My chief object'in going to tiie Murrse hills was to see you, and state my griev ances; I had heard that all Saliibs acted upon one principle, for instance, Colonel Phayr« kind as he had been, could not break bis orders and hear what I had to say, as you probably would have to act in the same, manner, and did not see you. Being helpless, I went to Kandahar, and made my salaam to the Meer, as most people troubled by their own race, confide their difficulties to their friends—' Cherisher of the poor, the above is my petition.' Ameer Shore Ali Khan has beeil Very kind to us, I have to thank you for this. Shahan delivered a verbal message from you, that if T, Zaro Vv uZt ei Khan. Sirdar Moolah Mahomed, had sufficient confidence in you, that you would meet me at any place I might name, and make arrangements for me. ' Oh 1 Dispenser of Justice,' I never despair of fair treatment from the English Go vernment, but have not the slightest confidence in His Highness, for this reason, that he has frequently broken his oaths and promises, and treated us badly. Captain Harrison flattered us at first, but soon took the Khan's side and left us. ' Cherisher of the poor,' I have sent a list of all the lands I am entitled to, to Colonel Phayre, if you have any intention of getting the whole of Khorasan into your hands, I shall not despair. Our arrangements represent the requirements of the whole ot Khorasam If you have made arrangements for Khorasan, write me a cheering letter, stating that you will hold yourself personally responsible for Khodadad's treatment of myself and the other Sirdars; if you will do this, we will come when you like, and to any place you may desire, and say all we have to say. Then Sir, of your great wisdom, having considered the matter, give those that are in the right their due, and withhold any whose claims are unjust. We are awaiting your reply. God willing, to the best of my abilities and to the end of my life, I will not fail you. The Governor of Kandahar and the Ameer Wuzeer are making the arrangements you wish regarding Kafilas going from Kandahar to Dhera Ghazee Khan. I am residing in Kandahar, Sirdar Sher Ali is the Governor, the Wuzeer is Syud Noor Mahomed Shah, who used to visit Colonel H. Green. I have sent Ala Dad Khan to make arrangements about Kafilas. Whatever is settled upon, I will report to you. I have sent Wuzeer Khan to Shahan Murree, who will take him to yon, and from him you will hear all I wish to say. Any orders you give I will obey. If you don't intend taking me into your service, write and tell me, as also any orders you may have to give. Consider me your well-wisher. Always remember me in your letters and make me happy. May your wish always be accomplished. (T rue copy of translation.) C. W. HARRISON, Captain, Political Agent, Khelat and BeloochistauFrom, Sirdar Moolah Mahomed Raisanoo, To, Bukt Yar Khan, Seehee.
