I was informed of all these events by Khan Bahadur Mulla Saleh, Secretary to His Excellency the Shaikh. It runs as follows 0.. On or about the 26th July 1931, 20 persons from Buraih section of the Mutair tribe came to Kuwait headed by Muhammad bin Musaiyis, one of the small Shaikhs of Mutair, and put up.guests with His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. 3 t During their stay they approached Shaikh Abdullah al- Jabir and complained against the Dhafir camped in the territory of Kuwait saying that about 8 or 9 of their camels had been robbed from them and that they could trace their t^ks until they came to a short distance before Subaihiyah where they could not see anymore, their traces/and that they wanted to search for these camels among the camel herds of the Dhafir, but they were not allowed to ^ i dO SO. • The number of the Dhafir, who are in the Kuwait terri tory ceme to about three hundred tents eamped at Jahrah, Subaihi yah and Tawil. Some of their chiefs were sent for by Shaikh Abdullah al-Jabir, and when they came and were asked about the camels in question they said that they knew nothing at all about them. They also asked whether the Mutairis could'prove their statement, which the latter could not do.^ &gt; It is a custom between tribes, tliat if a claimant cannot trace Ms animals up to the camp of an accused party he cannot have the right to search for them among the herds. Also it was feared that owing to the enmity between these tribes, a fight could very easily arise between them if the Mutairis wese allowed to enter the camp of the Dhafir. Therefore their ease was refused and they were not allowed to search for their camels among the Dhafirs* herds. It was also pointed out to them that as they had come on a mission without the proper procedure of obtaining Ibn Saud's permission to come and submit their claim. £ , The ^utairis then remained four days on the look out, and on the night of the S9th July 1931, they saw two Dhafiris accom- 1 panied by two women leave Kuwait for Jahrah on four camels, two of which were loaded with provisions. They followed them half way, where they attacked them, drove away the 4 camels and took the persons as captives with them. When they arrived at Shuqaiq, they let the^persons go without any food or water, and took the camels away with them. 1 ■ On their way they passed some of the herds of the Dhafir who were camped at Tawil, which were grazing at Khabrat Jilhim with only one shepherd in charge, on whom they fired, the shepherd replied but being one against 20, decided to fly leaving the camels in the hands of his opponents. The Dhafir encamped at Tawil heard the firing and appeared on the scene and Joined in the fray thereby putting to flight the Mutair one of whom was shot and later died. A camel of the Mutair was also killed. The flying Mutair left behind all the camels they had captured which were taken over by the Dhafir. The actual fighting took place within Kuwait territory.^ The foregoing are the true facts fqp reported in this office Diary No.14 of 1951. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Offg* Political Agent, Kuwait.VIO - • , i y Political Agency, Kuwait. No* HLf, Dated the 18tli August 1951. From z The Political Agent, Kuwait. To . r xhe iiOn , ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His i -.xcellency the Jhaikh came to see me this morning and reported as follows 0n 16th August, four servant-s of Shaikh Sulman al-Hamud, his cousin, were proceeding South on camels with provisions for their families, who are in camp in the desert in that direction; when near Fanatis, 17 to 18 miles from Kuwait, they were approached by five officials of Ibn ^aud, on camels, who attacked them. The servants fled towards iujwait and seeing some people in camps nearby asked them uo give help which they did and the result was Ibn oaud T s officials v/ere routed, and disappeared in the direction of Subahiyeh. A similar occurrence took place at Chebd. oome tribesmen of Kuwait, wi 1ii provisions, were on their way v /hen they //ere approached, at Ghebd-, a pla.ce in the southern vicinity of Jahrah, by a party^of men recognized as being Ibn Saud T s officials, v/ho Just interrogated them as to where they were taking these provisions, etc. His Excellency points out ^ithat here are two occasions occurring almost simultaneously of Ibn Saud r s subjects entering Kuwait territory and even coming so near Kuwait town without permission and with the obvious intention of searching parties who had been secretly bjtying provisions in the town, and he requests that these incursions be put a stop to as thej are likely to cause serious trouble. He also mentioned that the five men near Fanatis could easily havebeen captured by his servants and punished by him, but he gave orders that they be allowed to leave his territory unmolested. His excellency informed Ibn Saud*s Trade Agent, Abdullah an- i.o.fl si , of these occurrences, who stated he had no knowledge whatever of them and that it was entirely a wrong Drocedure and that the men should be seirerely dealt with. ^ is His IUxcellency 1 s opinion that the Dhafir tribe of 'Iraq who have encampments, at Jaharah, Subaihiyeh and Tawil in Kuwait territory, be given orders to leave at once and his reasons are as follows:- The Dhafir are the most troublesome and wicked of all the tribe They are constantly creating strife and trouble between the ICuwait and Uejd tribes, by stealing from one and laying the blame on the other. They are well known as camel thieves and at present it is known that many of the Kuwait camels are in their possession. If these camels are seen at any time by the tribes of Kuwait there will certainly be trouble and pro bably fighting. As the Tidawiyah have now come to camp at 2s Jahrah, His Excel lency has given those of the Dhafir tribe at Jahrah and Subaihiyeh .to understand that they must leave Kuwait territory within 10 days. This order Y/as given 7 days ago and so far has not been complied with and though His Excellency is quite capable of executing his orders by force he refrains from doing so as he considers it more satisfactory if either the Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf and His Excellency the High Commissioner for T Iraq take the matter up and so settle the question amicably.

Sir, Lazzam aba Dhaira' (Shaikh of Usmadasub- section) of Dhafir tribe of r Iraq came to see me this morning, 20th August 19 51, and stated that he is encamped at Jahrah, and about a month ago he sent some of his men to Kuwait to purchase provisions and to change a 100 rupee note. 2 # After purchasing the provisions and changing the note into rupees, 3 men and 3 women with 7 camels loaded with provisions and the money left to return to Jahrah. At Sulaioilzhat half way between Kuwait and Jahrah, they were attacked by 5 men of thefffutair tribe and in the fray were robbed of 2 camels and the 100 rupees. 3, The abovenamed Shaikh requests that, as the Mutair,under Shaikh Mahomed bin Musaiyis, are under Ibn Saud' s orders, he, Ibn Saud, be asked to instruct these men of the Mutair to return to him the 2 camels and the money. 4, 4jgbmewhat similar facts were reported in my Diary No.14 of 1931 and my letter No. 108 dated 5th August 1931 { but this statement shows otber details of what probably was the same affair.

In the meantime practically all the Dhafir who were at Jahara and Tawil have gone North to Ira^, and those at Hafar al Batin ov/ing allegiance to Iraq have also moved north. 5, No doubt His Majesty King Abdul Aziz will when Jedaan reaches Riath either order him to cross into Nejd territory if he / /—p — I iq wisiiGs to aoo6p't liis 8.-Lj.8gia.iLC6 or if no'tj I ig will lot) us knov/ and we oan take aotion this end ( in conjunction with the Iraq authorities if necessary).

Sir, I have iiie honour to refer you to your confi dential memorandum No. 589-S dated 8th September 1931. 2. I regret having failed to answer your memo randum earlier as I inadvertently mislaid same amongst other papers requiring attention at leisure. 3. Both His Excellency the Shaikh, whom I have consulted, and I are of opinion that the matter was unimportant, and having settled itself, no further notice need be taken of the incident. The Mutair tried to take justice into their own hands against the Shaikh's orders to them, and stole some Dhafir camels who were leaving Kuwait for Jahara. These again were rescued friends, as well as some captives who were taken with them. That left honours easy. 4. Next cernes Lezzam al Badrah ; and obviously fabricates a story to Dr. G-reenway whom he hoped to deceive (being only temporarily in charge) ; to the effect that the Mutair had also carried off Rs 100/- belonging to him which was in the safe-keeping of one of the prisoners (Dhafir). He no doubt had hopes of getting this amount out of Dr. Greenway as sort of rt hush fT present. 5. The Shaikh says the story was elearly a false hood and one typical of a Dhafiri who are adepts at 'low' tricks of this nature. I am in entire agreementwith the Shaikh, having knov/n Lezzam personally for the last 13 years. The Shaikh added to me that Lezzam visited him immediately after seeing Dr. Greenway and never mentioned a single word about the loss of Rs 100/-. According to Custom the Shaikh dismissed him with a present of Rials 100.

Remainder of Part y, Abdul Aziz bin Duhiman Hamud bin Wanayan Mutluq al Hirshani Sa^d bin Radnan Samakh al Kahtani (ii) In case (b) H.S. the Shaikh tells me that the men were were clearly recognized as being a 'war' party (Sariya) from Nejd from the style of the trappings on the dromedaries (uilcaib), and from the cut of their (men's) clothing, and their mode of speech. But as each mn's face was closely hidden by his headcloth (kaffiya) which was wound round his head exposing only the eyes, it was not actually possible for the Kuwait party to identify thecio In the Shaikh's opinion however, and this view is shared by myself, the men were actually the same as were concerned in raids (a) and (o) men tioned above. Lastly the names of all ihe persons given in the previous paragraph are known to form part of Bin oaud's blockading force under the orders of Abdur Hah- man bin Muharib (ibn Arfaj's successor) who has his headquarters permanently at Jarriya (150 miles south of Kuwai t • IM ia A ?

No raids have occurred during the period under report, but it may not be out of place to mention, as no Intelligence Report has been issued since 23rd Julj that in August three small incursions of Bin Saud^ 'fidawi' or paid servants took place into Kuwait ter ritory. These were on (a) 10th August 1931, (b) 121ii August 1931, (c) 19th August 1931 , and were probably all committed by the same party. The raiders were obviously acting under the orders of Abdur Rahman al-Muhairib of Jarriya, as the men were recognizee in each case. (a) and (b) were duly reported to the Hon'ble the Poli tical Resident and formed the subject of an official despatched to His Majesty^s Government. (c) was stupidly not reported earlier to the Political Agent on the excuse that the authorities in Kuwait were * collecting evidence. The main facts in case (c) are as follows:-. On 19th August 1931, a Nejd merchant one Salih bin Ayaf, domiciled in Kuwait who had been to Nejd for the purpose of getting married, was returning home. At Shaiba, on the cost, he was set. upon by 6 men who said they were servants of Abdur Rahman al Muhairib, Bin Sand's official at Jarriya. After beating him they took from him £T 60 the property of a subject of the Shaikh of Kuwait&lt;, On protesting he was told to repair to Jariya. This he did and says he made full ccmplaint and representations. The man has now returned to Kuwait with the report that his money was all confiscated on the excuse that it was to have been used for trading purposes with Kuwait* His E. the Shaikh has addressed His Majesty the King on the sub- jeot.

Sir, s ■ / \ Reference my confidential NOolSS dated 4th November 1931 and paragraph III of same, also in con tinuation of my confidential No«136 dated 5th November 1931 both of which should reach you by the same mail as this letter; I have the honour to report that on the 4th November I received a visit of His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait who somewhat excitedly and with considerable indignation complained to me that Abdur Rahman ibn Muharib, Bin Baud's frontier officer at Jartiya, had followed up the activities in August of his Lieutenant Farraj ibn Muhilan al Subhan ^ himself secretly crossing into Kuwait territory on the 29th October^ adopting the role of a military reconnaisance patrol and remaining there till the evening of the 2nd November # 2, His Excellency said that the man was accompanied by an escort of 3 armed camel ^ riders, and quite obviously took pains to keep his movements as secret as possible, coming to water only twice and then to the • out of the way wells of Kabd and Chadgdiyeh 25 and 15 miles from Kuwait territory 0 respectively. During the whole five ti-C days he remained lurking among the heavy sand hills in /C considerable numbers to the South West of Kuwaiti 3. The Shaikh further stated that he first had news of ibn Muharib 1 s presence from some wood -cutters(on 1st Hovember) who reported that they had been held up, on the 2 previous days (30th and 21 st) at the point of the rifle by a band of 4 men who had suddenly emerged (on both occasions) from the sand dune country some miles to the East of Kabd wells» After having been interrogated^ they, the wood-cutters, were let go. The questioning took the 1 form of a regular inquisition as to whatAwazim and Mutair or other tribal caravans were in Kuwait, who the leaders were, what they were buying and when they were likely to leave. The wood-cutters did not recognize the party the first day, but on the second one of them recognized ibn Muharib himself. 4. The Shaikh said that on hearing the news he at once sent out an armed party in 2 cars to Kabd wells which there met several Bedouins watering their flocks who reported having seen, recognized, and talked with Abdur Rahman al-Muharib and party, who they said had shortly before come to water. 5. The car patrol having reported the above facts, the Shaikh again sent them out (on 2nd November) to Chadadiyeh wells some 15 miles from Kuwaito Here they had found more Bedouin who reported that ibn Muharib and party/ watered that morning. fhe Bedouin, knew and recognized the leader and members of the party. 6. Saud ibn Nimran in charge of the Shaikh's car patrol immediately returned to Kuwait and asked per mission to pursue and capture ibn Muhabib and his men as their^ footprints were clearly visible and could be followed up. The Shaikh Borbad this, lest as he said a fight take } / place and further complications arise. 7* The Shaikh did however send out a couple of scouts on camels to follow and get into touch if possible These men later came back with the news that ibn Muharib had spoken with them and had given out that he was looking for 2 escaped slaves from the camp of the Mutair at Haffar who had taken shelter in Kuwait. This according to the ohaikh was obviously a blind for the slaves were known to bein Kuwait, whicli they had reached 10 days before 8. The Shaikh ended by requesting me to report the above facts to you and particularly asked that urgent re presentations be made to H.M.King Bin Saud both with regard to the previous cases of aggressions in AugustjSicS if this had not been done already, and the present spying activities of ibn Muharib, This if you approve, I suggest might be done t ele graphi cally # Shaikh protested that he was always willing to see and welcome any Nejd official who cared to openly visit Kuwait, or who had any complaint to make against any of his subjects, but that the incursions of August on the part of ibn Huharib f s lieutenant and paid mai, followed by the present hole am corner spying of ibn Muharib himself could not be tolerated, and if not sharply checked would in his opinion only result in bolder action on the part of Ibn Baud's unscrupulous representative, with the inevitable regretable results (raids and bloodshed) &lt;» lengthy report on an incident which may perhaps appear not of very great importance to one not residing in Kmrai^but I hasre done go of set purpose, as I believe the present activi ties of ibn Muharib are merely Ifce prelude to more vigorous blockade measures which are to come into operation this winter, the period when everyone begins to iiiink of raids etc, in Arabia. I feel with the Shaikh that if we draw Bin Saud , s attention at once to what his lieutenants are doing, he, Bin Sdud, will realize that we are wide awake and are not to be caught nappingo H© will then countermand any orders contem plated or given^which may show him up in bad light with H .M, Government. and if we make no protest now, we may expect more serious trouble to follow, as the Arab mentality works 'tiiis way® 10, I apologize fdar having submitted such a 11. I think it is the old story of the M try on', I have already mentioned in my confidential that I suspect thatthe Dhafir tribe under Jadaan al Suwait, are to be shortly mede use of by Bin Saud to prosecute 'Sie feieka blockade of Kuwait^botii to save himself tlie necessity of keeping a paid force on tlie frontier and to be able to deny responsibility should any regrettable incidents occur, this under the plea that the Dhafir are a well known and bad tribe of ^raq, and that he (Bin Saud.) cannot be held to blame if they run wild on the southern border of Kuwait, it being an affair for Kuwait ana ^raq to settle. Certain it is that ibn Muharib has been visiting the Dhafir camps much too often of late, and the way in which this tribe has been, vigourously interfering with other tribesmen coming ard. going into Kuwait of late cannot be considered a mere accident. 15* The Dhafir at the moment of writing have all crossed into Bin Saud's territory from Subaihiyeh and are camped in the Garaa region across the Nejd border. They are suitably located therefore f or stopping caravans going South. 14. News received today (6th November 1931) is that Jadaan al Suwait returned back from Riath on 4th Novem ber 1931 where he formally ^ent to offer the allegiance of himself and his sections to Bin Saudo The latter / it is said^has new secretly accepted liie offer under signed docu ment^ and has presented Jadaan with 70 bags of rice to seal the compact. Bin Saud has J&amp;ee also, it is said, passed orders that Jadaan should receive an annual grant of 140 bags of rice apart from moneyo This rather disquieting news is be lieved by the writer to be not far from the truth, though it remains to be confirmed of coarse. The &amp;&amp;&amp;- facts should become public property in a few days. The credit or dis credit of course for weaning Jadaan away from his loyalty to ^raq must go to ibn Muharib, who for long has worked to accomplish this end and get this tribe to do the King's work on the Kusmit frontier. £ p ^ o I have the honour to be, ^ Your most obedient servant, A* 7S^' s i' ^ 77 ^ ^ Lleut-Col,, 747•- -olit ioal Agent, Kuwait./t&gt;QJ No .

Sir, In continuation of my confidential No. 156 dated 6th November 1931, I have the honour to forward translation of the following two letters which His Excel lency the Ruler of Kuwait informed me had been despatched on the day after he visited me (i.e. on 5th November). (a) Letter No.R/182 dated S4th Jamad Than! 1350 (5th November 1931) with mulhaq from H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait to H .M.the King of Hejaz &amp; Nejd (b) Ditto No.R/183 dated 24th Jamad Thani 1350 (5th November 1931) from H .E. the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Amir Saud. 2. His Excellency informed me that while he had purposely made no mention of the spying activities of Ibn Muharib in his letter to the King out of politeness he had nevertheless instructed Abdullah al-Nafisi, Bin ■ Saud 1 s Trade Agent here to send a full account of the 3 incidents of August, as will as the activities of Ibn Muharib inside Kuwait territory, to the King# The actual draft of al-Nafisi's letter was, the Shaikh said, written out by himself. 3. In the above letter al-Nafisi was made to say that, the Shaikh of Kuwait, was very hurt and upset \ that such incidaits had taken place but that he was con fident that His Majesty, (Bin Saud) who of course could i know nothing of the matter, would take immediate steps in the matter, on hearing of them. Al-Nafisi was further made to add that the Stolkh did not care to nake a v.,a persanal caiiplaint to the King, lest he hurt his feel ings too much. 4&lt;» I inention the above in detail as it is am abusing and typical example of the 'tortuous' methods adopted by Arabs in high places in their diplomatic dealings• I have the honour to be , Sir, Your most obedient servant, , - Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait,S toll - 5ir ai-Jaalr aa-oubali, C#S«I* f Rule] Kuwait, Kuwait* To - il.U.^buiiI biii ^xbdur Ealii.^ui ai-Ifaicai, -in..: of the i^ijaz and Nejd and Dependencies, RIYADH# ilo .R/18S.

As I think it would be a good thing if Baghdad were made aware of the news, I am enclosing a dup licate copy of Hi is demi-official letter for you to send on if you desire. 5 # Both al-Nafisi and the Shaikh tell me that there are more than ordinary rumours that Bin Saud will shortly visit Hassa. Also that he intends either before or after sudi visit, to come up to ^Tarriya to inspect his pri vate camel^ herds which are in charge of al-Shuwaish there. &gt; 6 One thing is certain, 400 tins of petrol : have recently been dumped at Jarriya, and unless these are for blockade patrol cars (of which more are in evidaice) it looks as if Bin Saud might himself come along.

The escort duly arrived in Kuwait on 14tli January, and their leader was seen by the ^oiltical Agent# In a letter which al-Bagaawi brought from ibn Jaloui, the latter wrote that he expected ibn Satd in Hoffuf within the week, {which would make him due about 7th January)• Although Naf isi had made arrangements to send Fahad and his brother to Hassa via Bahrain, plans were changed at the last moment and the party declared their intention of leaving by land on 17th January. Apparently i the whole trouble with the two boys was the fact that Bin Saud did not give them the salary that they considered- suitable, hence their ef art to gain King Faisal 's court and be taken on there.

It may i&gt;e recollected that in the latter part of 19S0 and early in 1931 much correspondence took place regarding 16 camels that the above individual a Kuwait i subject had raided from him by Harb tribesmen of Nejd whilst I grazing in the vicinity of Managish, inside the borders of Kuwait. Ibn Arfaj the King's then frontier officer behaved very badly over this affair, and after many efforts to get him to hand back the camels in exchange for the actual raiders who had been followed, captured, and incarcerated in Kuwait, managed to bluff the Shaikh into handing over ' T the men first, and in return only handed over 4 camels, himself keeping 12 back. Nemesis has overtaken ibn Arfaj-4- Arfaj at last as ibn Khudaiyir recently repaired to Hiyath to lay his case before the King. !Ehe latter after hearing his story wired for ibn Arfaj to be sent from Hassa and on his arrival had him cast into prison. He then gave 1000 Rials to ibn Khudaiyir and presented 12 of his own camels to him. The latter has now returned to Kuwait with wonder- ful stories of Bin Saud q s generosity and sense of justice, and far the moment everyone is singing the King's praises, V0 Appointment of new frontier .Officers .

In a recent letter dated 27th December last (received on 16th January 1932) and addressed to the Shaikh of Kuwait with copy to the Political Agant, Bin Saud writes that the following are officials appointed to hear compla ints both on the frontiers and in the interior, and that any Kuwait subject searching for'finding a lost or stolen camel with any Nejdi should in the first place lodge his complaint to one of the frontier officials nearest to him.

This order if you recollect was subsequently cancelled by the King on your • showing that a misunderstanding had arisen (vide your telegram ftio»T.23 dated the 29th January 1932 to Secretary of State for the Colonies). (b). Letter B - was received by the Shaikh shortly after my return to Kuwait from Hoffuf. As I thought it was written by Ibn Jaloui, at the same time as Bin Saud sent his 'angry' telegram forbidding Kuwaitis to cross the border (see rt A tt above) and was the Governor of Hassa's contribution in the 'misunderstanding' that had taken place, I counselled patience, and suggested to the Shaikh that before taking any hasty action (such as protesting through His Majesty^ Grovernment) he should write to the King and try and get the order cancelled much as you^ done in the first case. The Shaikh agreed to abide by my advice, and sent off the necessary letter^ see 'D' below and Mulhaq No.5. Al Nafisi also who entirely agreed with my view wrote to Bin Saud unofficially in the same sense and urged his master vary strongly to oanoel Ibn Jaloui 'sJaloui's 'impossible' order. I am in hopes therefore that the matter will be satisfactorily settled. ther he.rid should the King not agree, on the grounds that the order is connected with the new Customs 'farm' recently taken out by Ai Qosaibi, and is intended as an anti- smuggling measure pure and simple, then the natter becomes a serious one indeed, for it will create an impossible situation for the Kuwait and part of the Bahrain^pearling fleets, which work for 4 months on the banks off the Hassa Coast, without returning to port, and who regularly and from time immemorial i have been accustomed to land, when short of firewood and water, and replenish supplies from the main land* In the above event the matter will have to be taken up by His Majesty's Grovernment, and strong pres.: ure brought to bear on Bin 3aud to cancel th e order♦ In the meantime we may await a reply to the . i t Shaikh* s letter on the. subject. ^ ^ r • ' (o). Letter 'C' with 4 Mulhaqs. Ihis needs , little comment. Mulhaq I contains a very sensible sug estion, which is accepted by the Shaikh vide his letter 'P' below and llulhaq I. (Bin Saud also mentioned this matted to you 1 L in Hassa)• ' Mulhaq II confirms that a misunderstanding did take place, and that you were able to clear it up. This letter obviously crossed the Shaikh of Kuwait s letter ?t A' f discussed above. Mulhaa III deals with the Shaikh of Kuwait's reply to the King's letter No»676 dated the bOth December 1931 and Mulhaq which I personally took with me to Hoffuf and gave to the King { no copy was sent to Bush ire), and concerns questions of detail in the matter of following up stolen or lost camels by tribesmen. The Shaikh you will see agreejto the King's proposals vide his letter rt D' below and Mulhaq III.

Mulhaq No.6 advises Bin Saud of the departure of the Kuwait f, Haj' party to their concentration camp at Jahara on the 12th February 1932, and says that the pilgrims will move as a formed body from there on the 19th February 1932.

The prevention should include the rank and file of the 'Siriyahs' (armed war parties) only, for Your Majesty no doubt knows better than ourselves the ways of officers and men forming patrols and the things that result from their act le vities when liberty is granted them to cross frontiers; most of them stop at no limit, and go further than they should in matters that worry the mind, while our greatest wish is always to give pleasure and satisfaction to Your Majesty*Therefore, if Your Majesty's order for the prevent ion of our subjects from crossing the frontier is due to the British Government's demand, we assure Your Majesty that they do not desire or mean the prevention of anyone except the 'Siriyahs'.

I, your brother, did indeed become greatly annoyed on account of the trouble that this event caused to the British Government, and 1 did not receive any information from you about same. it is essential that you aJiould always inform me, your brother, or inform your son ^a'ud, or 'Abdullah Ibn JTuwi, or Ibn Musa'ad of all such events; every event should be reported to the person in whose jurisdiction it happens to take place, so that difficulties can the more easi ly be removed. As I, your brother, had no previous knowledge of this matter, which I received with surprise, I could not but comply with the request in order to please the British G-overnment. I also was under the impression that that the original request originated from you, but after I had met the abovementioned persons, the confusion was made clear, and I regretted indeed that such a misunderstanding had occurred.

I, your brother, have gone through your Muliiaq No.286 and understood your statement therein. Your agreement to the proposal of your brother is no doubt due to your good conscience and thougjitfulness for which we thank, you. As to your proposal that it would be much better for those persons (Bedouin) who may have a claim in either of the two countries, to take a letter of authority first: this is a good idea, but, may G od save you, it is advantageous in one direction and difficult in another. Advantageous for a person who has lost, or has been robbed of, his property (camel): and who has an accusation to bring against a certain person or tribe ) in respect of same. In such a case it is quite right that he should first obtain a paper of recommendation, and 1iien search for his lost property, and finally submit the matter to the i. ' authorities concerned (whichever side is affected), when he Ms found his property, or got some news about it, as has been decided. It is difficult however for a person who has lost, or has been robbed of, his camel and, he happens to be max i close to the frontier. Such a person should be allowed to track his camel until he reaches your or our frontiers (as the ■ case may be), it is quite impracticable for him to get previous permission. His obvious cause is to cross the frontier tracing his camel and searching for it, and when he has found it, or been told about its whereabouts, he should ask for it from the person with whom it was found. If that person refuses to restore it to him, then he (the complainant^ should submit the matter to the local authorities concerned, whether they repre- sent you or us.

Dear Sire, may God prolong your life and prevent any grief befalling you. I, your brother, am quite satisfied that Your Majesty aims at nothing that is not for our good and comfort, and I feel quite sure that Miis particular question arose out of nothing but a misunderstanding, for I see no reason at all for its having taken place. We submitted to Your Majesty in our letter No. 290 dated the 16th Ramadhan 1350 {24th January 1932) that in our view the British Government did not mean by their communi cation to prevent tribes crossing the border. Their communi cation must have meant the tt Siriyahs t, only (armed war parties), whose crossing of the frontier would no doubt result in infringements that only upset minds, and which according to Your Majesty's good will for us and desire for our comfort, we feel sure would never have been approved of by you. You also pointed out that when anything happens it should be reported to Your Majesty direct, or to those in whose jurisdiction the event may take place, such as your honoured son Saud, or Abdullah bin Jluwi, or Abdul Aziz bin Musa^d, so that all matters can easily be settled.i Dear Sire, we have never yet hesitated, to refer such matters to Your Majesty, but have always had tie honour 4 of doing so.

I have noted your Mulhaq No.13/1/6 and understood whatever Your Majesty intends to convey. I thank you, in deed, for Your Majesty's kindness in agreeing to the latter idea, which should be taken by those who may have claims in either of the two countries concerning lost or robbed property, of which a certain person, or tritee, may be accused. You point out that should a person lose or be robbed of a camel of his, while he is near the frontiers, he will be unable to obtain the necessary letter first but that he must, to be sucessful, cross the frontier at once, tracing his camel and searching for it, and that when found, or discovered for him, he must demand from the person who has got it, or, if the latter refused to restore it to him, refer^ the matter to the authorities concerned whether representing Your Majesty or us. And you say that this method is more convenient to the people, because if the claimant had to obtain prior permission, he would never be able to trace his camel. T, your brother, agree to any method that Your Majesty adopts for the comfort of both sides, and I have informed your servant Abdullah an-Nafisi of my entire agreement with Your Majesty^ suggestion, in order that he might instruct your servant Ibn Khuraimis to this effect.

Cn 15th March Mubarak moved up ?7i Hi his 6 men ^ bivouaoed at Arfajiyeh, a group of six wells South-East of Burgan hills and close to Shin^iti wells. The group of wells mentioned is not marked on any official map, but lies 8 miles inside the Kuwait border. 4. On 16th the whole party openly aM by day moved from Arfajiyeh to point sli^atly south of Shuaiba village on the coast, (some 20 miles inside the boundary) and seized 8 Beni Khalid tribesmen moving south with supplies which they had purchased in Kuwait. The men were bound, beaten and together with their camels were driven off to a hollow near 2 Apparently on or about 14th March Ibn Khraimisnear same wells called Um al Hiiaan lying one mile from the sea in uiae vicinity of some vegetable gardens knosrn locally as Al liasej^a^ 5a Mubarak remained at Um al Eim£LiL, operating from his hollow, and tnreatening all and sundry with dire penalties if they divulged his hiding place, until the evening of the HOth March when he returned to Arfajiyeh, with a quantity of loot and about 15 captured camels. Snroute he seized a couple ot unoffending ^wazim tribesmen, their caiaels and sheep i and raBrccied tnem ox*f also, although theiy apparently were unconnected with any blockade runnings ^ ^ time of these events I myself happened to be in camp at Araif jan, a point six miles south of Um al Himan and hearing whispers of the 'Sarriyas' (armed party) activities proceeded alone by car to Um al Himan on the morning of 21st March but found the party flown. My intention was to warn the leader that he could not operate inside Kuwai t territtry and to turn him and his party out. 7 • On ESnd March I returned to Kuwait and in the absence of His Excellency • W ■ - .Lb. . . ,wi-i. at Riath, I suggested to Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir who was acting for him, that he should immediate^ send out messengers to the armed party and tell them to retire and at the same time write a strong protest to Ibn Khraimis who was camped at Higai. I also arranged tla t Abdullah al Nafisi, Bin Baud's agent in Kuwait should also do rs the same. The necessary letters were at once sent. So On S3d§ March I again proceeded on my own to Arfajiyeh to find and interview Mubarak but v^ras told that he had moved south into Neutral Zone. I found the country side in a regular panic and met many groups of poor Kuwait Bedouin fleeing x in a Westerly direction to avoid having their flocks of sheep taken* 9 While I was at Arfajiyeh two cars containing the Shaikh's men accompanied by Al Nafisi f s son crossed into Neutral zone and came up with Mubarak at Al Ratawi, a pointpoint norou—east o. .'/aira (noli on map)* H© bad only 2 men# (not 6 as previously reported) He said tliat the regaining IE men of liis party/were still in Kuwait territory but would return in tiie evening* With Muba rak were 20 captured oamels and a quantity of captured goods, 10. Nafisi^ son then asked Mubarak by what ri^it were his armed party moving about well inside Kuwait V territory disturbing the whole countryside, causing panic ( and seizing and beating persons. His reply given in rather boastful manner was that he had orders to pursue and capture any Nejd subjects, who entered Kuwait territory and that boundaries to tv him and his party were nothing. They were soldiers who obeyed orders and that until these were changed he would continue to cross the border as much as he chose. This reply apparently annoyed A1 Nafisi's sen, who said 'I am personally cognisant of Bin Saud f s orders on the subject of Nejd armed parties crossing the border, as these were recently conveyed to Ibn Subah under special letter from the King which I saw'. This appeared to sober Mubarak somewhat who changed his tone and agreed to refer the matter to Ibn Khraimis his superior officer. 11. Nafisi in subsequent coversation with me said he did not believe Mubarak would refer to his master as he was of the determined bullying type who probably knowingly exceeded his orders, and was engaged in an expedition of private loot. l2o Mubarak incidentally told the leader of the Shaikhs escort that his orders were to watch the area from the ShaqcL to the sea, but when asked ' south of what line' he replied that that part did not concern him. 1S # I have narrated t&amp;e ahove incidents at lengtl i : in case further action may have to be taken later in the iona of a protest to Bin Saud» F ot the present however I counsel doing no- t thing until I am in a position to report excatly /fohat action Ibn Khraimis takes on Abdullah si Jabir and A1 Nafisi's letters,It is possible, though not probable I think, that Mubarak was acting without autliority, and as suggested by al Kdfisi s soil was on a privat© raiding sxpsditiono i'or the momaat he and his party are out c± Kuwait, and in the Neutral zone. If Ibn Khraimis does the rigbt thing and repri mands his subordinate and forbids suoh incidents in future,, there will X think oe no need for His Majesty's Government to make an^ official protest* The incidents comx^lained of course ka^ssEHiiEsL I regret tlie rather diconnected nature of this letter, I have the honour to be.

The latter made a point of saying at he knew he had most untrustworthy officers on the frontiers whose one aim and object was to spoil neighbourly relations and he fulXy authorized him the Shaikh, to issue direct instructions on his behalf to his official Ibn Khraimis if any time he saw him going wrong.

Most of such claims came from Nejdis, and were not only unending but were for the most part of an extremely vague type and could not be proved. 5. 'G-ood' claims were for ever being settled by 'Arafa' methods. Nevertheless the Bedouin, whenever Bin Saud came to Riath swooped down on him and made life intolerable by the prefering of a vast number of 'bad' claims, hoping that the King who could do most things would be able to 'raise the dead' so to speak^ for them. | 6. There were two types of claims among Arabs said the Shaikh, the 'talab' and the 'dawa'. i hese must not be mixed up. A. 'talab' was the claim which could be proved and about which there was no doubt at all, for example a man claiming si sum of money from another for which he had a 'senad . oucn a claim could never under any circumstances be 'wasliea o ^ » an( 3 end would have to be attended to by v both Bin baud ana himselx . The Hon , ble Lieutenant—Colonel H./. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, Bush ire.In this category fell Kuwait's 'Akhwan' claims, which could all be proved by documentary and other evidence. fi-H nor was it sense to suppose that, a 'good' camel claim, howevei o.l , if brought forward now, ^ftould be reiecteci by either Bin K&gt;aud or himself, merely because it happened prior to Ramadhan 1931. It would certainly have to be attended to. ^da\va on the ofclier hand was the opening of a false 'case' or rather the preferment of a doubtful charge by one per son againsc anot.iie , in ttie belief that by clever argument false witness, and other shady means, he might get judgment in hi s favour. T he Bedouin were adapts at bringing forward such bad cases, ior ^ hope lives eternal ' r in the Ar'abs breast .and in the Bedouins breast in particular. It was to such cases that Bin Saud clearly referred, added the Shaikh, and which he also understood were meant when )) he agreed to the Raraadhan 1931 idea. 9* Personally when the Shaikh told me that he had t agreed to Bin Saud s proposal and without having previously rs talked the matter over with me, I must confess I thought nothing of the matter, and locked on the proposal in the sama light as the Shaikh did, for I also am painfully familiar with the Bedouin and his interminable 'camel' claims. They make one'giddy' as the Arab puts it. 10. Bin Saud I do not suppose yet knows anything of the claims we sent in, to His Majesty s Government, in respect of the So Akhwan damage, ^ I much doubt if there is anything of a'cunning' move behind his present proposal, nevertheless it is always as well to be forwarned, and I think your letter made the Shaikh tkxn; think ; as it did me. 11. In the meantime we have got the Shaikh s ideas on the subject, and we can always turn these up, should Bin Saud turn 'nasty'. I do not think it would be wise to do anything more at present. &lt;5^1 —&amp;i~ Whlf8048/32. fv £3, 7 c-« • !

The Residency, Bushire, the 5th March 19 36. • &gt; i {' I ^ xO ' 1 ^T'' ✓ Could you please refer to Ryan' 8 letter to Rendel of the 4th february 1936, Ho.254/380/27, with an enclosed Rote on the question of our control over the foreign relations of Kuwait. 2. Ryan agreed with me on the immediate question of the desirability of Ibn Saud*s visit to Kuwait, (and the Tisit itself was apparently a distinct success - Tide de Gaury* s letter ^o«C»49 of the 7th February 1936, copy forwarded to India Office, Oovernment of India and Jedda under my tinted letter ITo, 112- S of the 12th February 1936), but I think understood my views as to this control in a somewhat broader sense than I had intended. These - my views - were given in a telegram? (paragraph 1 of my Fo,83 of 29th January 1936 quoted by Ryan) and necessarily had to be given briefly® 3a The position as I see it is as follows. Our relations with the Arab Kulers are governed by certain treaties. Those with Bahrain and the Trucial Shaikhs (including Qatar) contain a specific provision th^ t the Bhaikhs concerned can have no communications with Foreign Rulers and therefore inferentially should not pay or receive visits without the sanction of His Majesty»s Government. In the Kuwait Agreements, however, there is nothing to prevent communications between the Shaikh and foreign ivulers, and therefore inf erentially he can pay and receive visits without the sanction of His Majesty's Government. 4. / The Hon 1 ble Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KG IS •, GSI•, IvTVO. , Foreign Secretary to the Government-2- -w^L 4. There is therefore a definite gap in our Kuwait Agree ments which we tried to fill up a couple of years ago. The result of this attempt is given in my letter No # 386-S of the 27th April 1934 to the India Office, (copy forwarded to Govern ment of India and Kuwait under -rty Printed Letter Ho,389-S of the same date), quoted by Ryan. The Shaikh reacted most unfavourably to the suggestion that official, correspondence between him and Ibn Saud should pass through the hands of His Majesty 1 s Government's Representatives? the Minister at Jedda and the Political Agent at Kuwait. 5. But when I said that our control over the foreign relations of Kuwait differed from that over those of the other Shaikhs all I meant was in regard to the particular point at issue i»e. communications with Foreign Rulers. Except for this point the Shaikh of Kuwait's position is similar to that of the other Shaikhs. He is not allowed to receive the Representative of any Foreign Power, or to cede, sell, etc., etc. any portion of his territory to the govern ment or subjects of a foreign Power without the sanction of His Majesty's Government (Aitchison P.O. No.XXXVI) or to import arms into, or export them from, Kuwait {Ibid X/DG11 } or to grant an oil concession without sanction of His Majesty s Government (Ibid XLI). It will be seen therefore that under our Agreements we have a fairly close control over Kuwait in the matter of foreign relations and otherwise, ana even ^th regard to communications we have the Shaikh^ assurance given in paragraph 11 of Dickson's letter N6.0-125 of the 6th April 1934 (copy forwarded to India Office and Government of India under ray Printed Letter No'. '358-3 of the 20th April 193 4) to the effect that he (the Shaikh) showed all official corres pondence with Ibn Saud to the Political Agent. ^ ^3 6. There is, however, the gap mentioned at the beginning of paragraph 4 above, I think Ryan is right in saying (paragraph 4 o.i nis Hote) tnat it was decided for the time being to drop the question of direct correspondence between the Shaikh of Kuwait and Ibn Baud more on grounds of expediency than of law. On a urtner reflection, however, I do not see how we can pursue the question in law. If the prohibition with regard to communications is nou in our Agreements naturally oar Agreements cannot, help us in this matter, and che fact that this prohibi tion is contained in our treaties with the other Shaikhs makes the omission with regard to Kuwait all the more obvious, I rather doubt whether points (a) s (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 of Ryan's Hots gat over this difficulty - at any rate so far as the Shaikh is concerned, 7, On the whole I think our control over the foreign relations of Kuwait is reasonably effective. */e might, however, fill the gap referred to above by following up the suggestion made in paragraph 6 of ii^y letter of 27th April 1954 quoted above madified by Warner's suggestion contained in the last f,. paragraph of the Report on the 1 Interdepartmental Committee on Kuwait affairs of 3th June 1954, what I suggest is that I should be authorised by His Majesty's Government to write to the Siiaikh as follows 5- That as he will doubtless remember in April 1934 Colonel Dickson approached him on the subject of official correspondence between him and His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and suggested tfet official correspondence between him and His Majesty should pass through His Majesty's Government f m Representatives at Jedda and Kuwait respectively instead of direct as heretofore. That he - the /-4- tlie SliB ikh - vvas unffxllxiig to agree to this for various reasons, but assured Colonel Dickson that all official correspondence between him and His Majesty, whether sent or received, was shown to the Political Agent. That the result 01 this conver s a t ion was duly reported by iq .6 to His Majesty's Government who received his - the Shaikh's - assurance with satisfaction, but did not pursue the matter xurther at the time ss he was then engaged in certain oil questions, and they did not wish to trouble him on a matter which though of some importance was of no particular urgency. That they thought, however, it would De as well that there should be some record - as between Hie Majesty^ Government and the Shaikh - of the conversation in question, ana have therefore instructed me to write to him as above. 8. I think that this letter will fill the gap already referred to in a practical manner. It will remind the Shaikh of his assurance, in case he has forgotten about it, and will ensure that he acts up to it» If he fails to do so, and correspondence of importance passes between him and Ibn Saud which he does not show to the Political Agent, we shall be in a. position to confront the Shaikh with his promise, and to consider any such communication as personal, of which we can refuse to take any official cognizance. Ho communication on the subject of the letter should - for obvious reasons - be made to Ibn Baud. There is no need for the latter to know officially that his correspondence is shown by the Shaikh to the Political Agent (though unofficially he is apparently well aware of it, vide paragraph 12 of Dickson's letter of /-5- oT 6tii April 1934), and as Bicksori^ approach to the Shaikh was confidential the matter should be kept as such between the Shaikh and Hi8 l&amp; j es ty 1 s rover nrnent. I do not propose that the suggested letter - if approved of by His Majesty's Government - should be sent to the Shaikh forthwithi coming too soon after Ibn Baud's visit to Kuwait it might give a wrong impression, I would keep the letter by me and choose some suita kie opportunity, probably when visiting Kuwait at some time in the future, to give it to the Shaikh after an appropriate conversation, x / I sua sending copies of this letter to Ryan, Walton ^and de Gaury ♦ , 'r jForwarded, to the Hon'Me Lieutenant Colonel ! .C. .

No date was mentioned in the letter and His Bxcellency's reply will be equally vague; although he hinted that he would probably want to take up the invitation at some time, perhaps in the Spring of 1937.

Much of this correspondence consists of copies of English translations of letters between Abdul Aziz ibn Abdulrahman ibn Faisal Al Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd (Ibn Saud)] and Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ of Kuwait.Correspondence early on in the file relates to reports of encroachments into Kuwaiti territory by officials of Ibn Saud. Later, the correspondence discusses a visit made by Shaikh Ahmad to Bahrein [Bahrain] and Dabai [Dubai] and a visit made by Ibn Saud to Kuwait in 1936. After details of Ibn Saud's visit are reported, the file contains lengthy correspondence between British officials regarding Britain's control over Kuwait's foreign relations. This includes a note entitled 'Foreign Relations of Kuwait' that was written by Sir Andrew Ryan, Britain's Minister to Saudi Arabia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
