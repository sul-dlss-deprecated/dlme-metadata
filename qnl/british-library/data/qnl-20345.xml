Londoii, {By Air Mail), Sir Herbert Samuel, High Commis sioner for Palestine, accompanied by Lady Samuel, arrived in London on June 26 for his annual period of leave, and was met at Victoria Station by representatives of the Colonial Office. Until his return the duties of the High Commissioner will be discharged by Sir Gilbert Clayton, I Chief Secretary of the Palestine adminis tration. It is under&gt;tooa that while Sir Her bert Samuel is m^London the Duke of Devonshire, Secretary of State for the Colonies, will take occasion to discuss with bim the situation created by the inability of the Arab members of the Palestine Advisory Council to take part in the business of the Council until an assu rance has been given that tlfey would not thereby associate themselves with the Constitution as set up by the 0«der in Council of 1922. Should it be found impossible to satisfy the Arab members on this point it may be necessary to recon titute the Advisory Council; but p ovi^ion has been made for this, as for a 1 ! contingen cies, the Amendment Order in Council recently published; and as announced in the House of Com mo »s on the 18th June, the Government will support the High Commissioner carrying onthead'iiinistra- tion of the country in harm ny with its declared policy, whether or not a particu lar Community (or its representatives) abstains from co-operation ' The draft of the proposed Treaty bet ween Great Britain and the King of the Hejaz is still under discussion between the Eoreign Office and Dr. Naji el Assil, King Hussein's Envoy. The Treaty is designed not only to consolidate the interests of the negotiating parties, but to ensure, as far as ^ possible, permanent peace among the A'rab peoples. It will not involve any modification of the obligations into which His Majesty's Government have entered under the Mandate for Palestine. The text of Article II, is given as follows in the official summary of the draft Treaty, published in Jerusalem :— ' His Eritaunic Majesty undertakes to recognize and support the independence of the Arabs in 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan, and in the Arab states of the Arabian Peninsula, exclusive of Aden. As regards Palestine, hia Britannic Majesty has already undertaken that nothing will be done in that country which may pre judice the civil and religious rights of the Arab community. In the event of the Governments of any or all of these terri tories expressing the desire to enter into an association for customs or other pur poses with a view to an ev* ntual confede ration his Britannic Majesty wil 1 , if requested to do so by the parties con cerned, use his good offices to further their desire. ' His Hashimite Majesty recognizes the special position of his Britannic Majesty in 'Iraq, Trans-Jordan, a-d Palestine, and undertakes that in such matters as come within the influence of his Hashimite Majesty concerning these countries, he will do his best to co -operate with his Britannic Majesty in the fulfil ment of his obligation.'© ^ — 'I' 1 '.

It is so crude h absurd that I have no hesitation in venturing the opinion that the document did not emanate from Bin 3aud,or at least it is so devised that he could with ease disclaim knowledge of it. On the other hand it fits in bo well with Bin Saudis policy that I am inclined to think that it may htve been prepared with his knowledge tf-bwith a definite object. There can be little doubt tnat to compass the down. ' 13. of .Ling Husaain has long been Bin daudicherished ambition.I believe he ^or a long time he was in receipt of * subsidy,? nd he did not want to lose it .After that, he could not find an adequrte excuse v.hich would have absolved him from personal responsibiltty in the eyes of H.M.&amp;.iwhom he feared would actively support the Sharif) the more especially as H.M.G. had for a long time been telling hin tri- t his differences with Hussain &amp; Transjordania were under consider- ^ ation, J: he mast do nothing xi:se[ to upset the prospects of GrOTt. making peace between them. He feared that any ction taken by him against Mussain at such a time 1 ould cause H.M.^ to support the latter.When Hussain at first declined to send his son to the Conference B.S. was delighted,as it gave him wotisszsA. an opportunity to put him in the wrong with which, he took full advantage of. I do not personally thinks he intended a peaceful solution to be a-rived ' at .in the Kuwidt conference ,but sent his delegation in Sir, would h've attacked the Hedjaz long ago but for these reasons- -)rder that no suspicion should rast on him of wishing to defeat its )bjeGt .Ha has stated sufficiently plainly since, that his enemies spoilt 'ihe conference while he ardently desired a peaceful soQ.iltion of the lifficulties. He was forced to put himself in the wrong in not sending lis son,when subsequently Hussain agreed to send Amir z&amp;id.for had he }ent him,*3^the^discussions been confined to only the two of uh- m,it rould have been extrememly difficult for him to saroid making peace dthout exposing his hand,and I believe,he wanted the conference to ail,in such a manner th* t he could put the blame on the others to act as an excuse for his future actions. On top of all this has come ussains assumption of the JLh^lifate,which has be-n the sir . I believe that hostilities would have broken outst before this but that the season is wrong for movements of the Akhwan.They must wait till next autumn rains provide grazing in the desert. Meanwhile believe Bin aaud is laying his plans,firstly to stir up trouble as far as possible among malcontents in the Hedjaz &amp; Transjordania [±n hich connection please see my 122^1^3 ^ secondly so to arrange matters hat he can escape personal responsibility.To this end he is making, much 11 f his inability to restrain his subjects who have, so loggsuffered at he hands of the 3harifian family A' while Hussains assumption of the Oialifo te affords him an excellent means of rousing the ardour of the ikhwan whose fanaticism has recently been declining. I am inclined to believe that this is where the doQUEmtt under ^consideration comes in. Generally, documents sent in by some such unofficial route, are aimed against the 'Sultan, but this one tauM be so much to his liking / that there seems no reason why it should be got up fc sent in behind his back. fOn the other hand / he could hardly,without being accused of causing the trouble,write in direct, lb under his own name,demanding that we deprive his enemies of assistance &amp; stating tto? that he is making preparations for war.

I Extract from 'Bombay Chronicle' dated 1st April 1924oENCLOSURE to DESPATCH No. OF Extract from 'BOMBAY CHRONICLE' dated 1st April 192A. MISCHIEF-MAKING IN ARABIA. SHARIF HUSEYTS PROPAGATOA. INDIGNATION OF SULTAN OF NEJD. (TRANSLATED) To the Editof of 11 THE CHRONICLE'. Sir, We beg you to open the columns of your paper to the following in the service of historic truth. The newspaper ' Al- Muqattam' (Egypt) published on the 21st of Jamadi-eth-thania 1342 ( January 27th 1924) a 'Statement of the King of Hejjaz' and we have read in some of the Syrian and Me sopot ami an newspapers stories and appeajs almost identical with that state ment. These publications contain allegations concern ing the Sultan of Nejd and his standpoint on the Arab question and toward Arab unity, which are contrary to the historic truth. We are really sorry that those responsible for them prefer disintegration to revival. The Sultan of Nejd has striven to build up unity during the world war and after the world war. He sent out many letters and envoys to Ibn ar- Rashid and the King of the Hejjaz and the Amir of Rsir and Koweit, but the King of the Hejjaz, among the rulers of Arabia, received the appeal with scorn and tried to wreck the work by stirring up seditions and intrigues against it in Asir and elsewhere as witness the missive from him to the people of Aidh and ar-Rashid(g) ar-Rashid which we have in our sai'e keeping. And what is to be said about the letoers sent by the oultan of Nejd tothe King of the Hejjaz and tohis sons, those letters which were published in the papers at the time, and which ' Al-Muqattam' published with their contents. Do not those letters tell of what is in the heart of the Sultan of Kejd. and of his noble wish for sincere friendship with his neigh bours and for unity with them. Jo people know that the King of the Hejjaz did not allow his sons to answer the Sultan of Nejd and that he (the King of the Hejjaz) transgressed the bounds of politeness for he addressed his reply to the people, of As-Saud and not tohim who sits upon the throne of Nejd. Is such behaviour calculated tooring near the time of Arao unity : . Is such a policy likely to unite the hearts of the Arabian rulers?'. The King of the Hejjaz pretends that he told the Sultan of Kejd that he was prepared -to abdicate and to give up the reins of power to anybody who was able to lead the Arabs to success and safety; but the fact is the exact opposite. It is true that the King of the Hejjaz produces before certain audiences allegations sucn as these to forestall criticism. The King of the Hejjaz wishes to possess himself of the supreme, effective rulership in the whole of Jazirat-ul-Arab, and he seeks to overthrow the rulers of the Arabs and to separate them from their countries and to interfere in their internal affairs, and that is something to which no one can consent. The written instructions of the King (of the Hejjaz to the people of Aqim and his urging them to break from their allegiance to their iiulLan is sufficient evidence of his secret, intentions towards the Sultan of Kejd and his country. We'We ha.ve before us the letters and documents which were found at Turbah end at Kharjah and at Asir and which establish the fact that the King of the Hejjaz and his son Abdullah, are working for their own de~ sires; and for their own advantages even though their success may involve the destruction of the Arabs. However, we refrain from publishing them for the present; but if the King of the Hejjaz gives us permission ?/e will publish them and then the whole Islamic and Arabian world will know the crimes and base intrigues in which those folks have been engaged, who now are raising such a cry and turning facts completely upside down to suit their purpose. And it will then be known which of tne two parties cares for the Arabian nation and its unity, and which has caused this discord and distrustful rivalry among the rulers, and has lighted these fires of sedition, and conspiracy between them. Then men will know for certain that the buitan of Mejd has been in his whole attitude nothing else than the defender of himself and his country and his honour, and that he has been, and will not cease to be desirous from the botuom oi his heart 01 building up Arabian unity on a foundation which will secure to the Arabs a power and a position worthy of their glorious history.

I of Serial No. 270.—Translation of a letter, dated 31st January 192Jf, purporting to he from the Sultan of Nejd to His Majesty King George. In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate. Praise be to the Almighty God who has created all things by his power. He is their maker by his bounties and He is their destroyer and He will cause their resurrection by His administration and wisdom. And He has created them in the light and darkness. He is the extender of the Earth and elevator of the heavens. He is the Greater of the universe and space and He is the Maker of humanbeings and the genii (jins) and He it is who has bestowed upon them His boons after their creation. He has made His prophets, His messengers and His angels superior to all the rest of His creatures, whatever they may be, except to His own self and His attributes. And He has sent down His Books and His words to all His angels. His prophets and messengers. He is worthy of praise and He is holy in His Kingdom in the highest heaven All are powerless to gain knowledge of Him. God is the Almighty, there is no God but Him alone. No one knows what He is but He himself The reins of affairs are all in His hand; they are pre-ordained and they ultimately return to Him. He wore the throne without really sitting thereupon or having a seat there. There was God and no space existed then. And He is now as He was before. Nothing was hidden from Him whether far or near. He knows all that revolves in the consciences of His slaves. He is aware of their secret intentions. He is unique in the administration of His kingdom. He hears and He can&lt;see. He gives and takes away. He rewards and punishes. He honours and He despises. He creates and grants livelihood. He grants life and He destroys. He pre destines and He ordains affairs. He controls all things created by him whe ther minute or very great, and they all ascend to Him. Not an atom moves but with His permission, and not a leaf falls down but with His knowledge. He is self-sufficient and can dispense with all things. All others are in need of Him. None can achieve a jot of good nor aught else but by His generosity and His mercy, and likewise none will meet with the slightest hurt or other evil but by His justice and His wisdom. He is omnipresent and all-seeing. He is present in all things created for a purpose through the medium of His power and His knowledge. He is not from a thing, nor He is in a thing and neither He is on a thing. If He was from a thing He would be a creature arid if He were in a thing He would be encompassed, and if He were upon a thing He would have been felt as a burden. And all He has created are made out of a thing, and are in things and are upon things. He is far from being capable of being described by a thing, or of being made to change into a thing, or of becoming the likeness of anything, or of becoming the partner of any thing, or of being in need of anything, or of entering into a dispute with anything. There is nothing resembling Him, and He is all-hearing and he is omniscient. And whatever strikes the minds of his creatures, God is just the contrary of the same. This is a letter from Imam Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Saood, may God grant him glory and all those of the Ikhwans who are encompassed by God the Compassionate's mercy, whose darkness is being lightened by the light of true guidance, and whose exaltation illuminates space, whose light shines forth on the darkness of the age, and whose existence brings joy to those that wept. Since they equal in goodness all that is now and that ever has been, may God's peace, happiness and bounties be upon them and His beneficence and His satisfaction. Amen. To His Majesty, King of England and Emperor of India, King George the establisher of safety in wildernesses and uplifter of ruined countries, who owns higher position and influence than other great Kings, who in eminence resembles the high firmament, whose orders bring about wonderful things and who is firm in the Christian religion; may God Almighty keep him safe may we receive benefits during his lifetime, may God lengthen his life and make lor him that happiness which He has granted him for ever during the succes sion of nights and days, and may He grant him victory and glorv in the reli gion of Christ, the son of Mary, and may He show and guide him to all that is good and may He ward off from him all that is evil, Amen. After compliments if you wish for news, you will hear it from those whom we have sent you on our behalf,and we hereby inform you that authority belongs to God alone and then to the Ikhwans—may God grant them victory.' We hereby give you the tidings that they are victorious over other rulers and US n Z * bet T en u /^ nd Hussein, ruler of Mecca, and between ™W nf flrlA n l of 11 Kllwait ' between us and Imam Az-Zaidi. uler of Sanaa, and God willing we shall be victorious over them all.

Amen. We have sent our representative to you, asking for the conclusion of a treaty between us and for assistance from you to us and to let us know what news you have and whom of the rulers, Turks or Arabs, you are assisting. And whom you support and whom you would leave alone now-a-days ? We now need your answer. The desideratum is the conclusion of a treaty between us and you, and God is a witness to the same. Our desire is for vou to discontinue the assistance you are rendering to the ruler of Mecca, as he is now an enemy to the Ikhwans, and also to cut off the help which you give to the Imam ruler of Sanaa, and after this we are prepared to accept what you like to have in return from us and what you need, and God is a witness to the truth of our statement. I urge you by God that if you are a friend of him who is your friend, then cut off your help to the 'imam ruler of Sanaa, as he is now an enemy to us and we are now advancing to fight him, and then afterwards we shall possess up to the sea by the medium of God 's power. And we shall compensate you with what you demand and your need shall be fulfilled by us. This was what we had to tell you, and an answer to which we need from you, and God is a witness to our statement. Dated 24th Jamad-al-Ukhra 1342, 31-1-1924. The number of the Ikhwans is 1,18,064.

He feared that any action taken by him against Hussain at such a time would cause His Majesty's Government to support the latter. When Hussain at first declined to send his son to the Conference Rm Saud was delighted, as it gave him an opportunity to put him m the wrong with His Majesty's Government, which he took full advantage of. I do not personally think he intended a peaceful solution to be arrived at in the Kuwait Conference but sent his delegation in order that no suspicion should rest on him of wishing to defeat its object. He has stated sufficiently plainly since, that his enemies spoilt the Conference while he ardently desired a peace ful solution of the difficulties. He was forced to put himself in the wrong in not sending his son, when subsequently Hussain agreed to send Amir Zaid, for had he sent him and had the discussions been confined to only the two of them, it would have been extremely difficult for him to avoid making peace without exposing his hand, and I believe, he wanted the Conference to fail, in such a manner that he could put the blame on the others to act as an excuse for his future actions. On top of all this has come Hussain's assump tion of the Khalifate, which has been the last straw. I believe that hostilities would have broken out before this but that the season is wrong for movements of the Akhwan. They must wait till next autumn rains provide grazing in the desert. Meanwhile I believe Bin Saud is laying his plans, firstly to stir up trouble as far as possible among mal contents in the Hedjaz and Trans-Jordania (in which connection please see my 122/1/3, Enclo. 2 of Serial No. (267)), and secondly so to arrange matters that he can escape personal responsibility. To this end he is making much of his inability to restrain his subjects who have ' so long suffered at the hands of the Sharifian family ' while Hussain's assumption of the Khalifate affords him an excellent means of rousing the ardour of the Akhwan, whose fanaticism has recently been declining. I am inclined to believe that this is where the document under consider ation comes in. Generally, documents sent in by some unofficial route, are aimed against the Sultan, but this one would be so much to his liking, that there seems no reason why it should be got up and sent in behind his back. On the other hand, he could hardly, without being accused of causing the trouble, write in direct, and under his own name, demanding that we deprive his enemies of assistance and stating that he is making preparation for war. I think if we were to ask him if the document came from him, he would at once deny all knowledge of it, but say that it was definite proof of the fact that his subjects could no longer be restrained and were clamouring for war, and thaf as he was holding them back, they had felt forced to get up this document and pretend it came from him, to force his hand. I may be unduly pessimistic but I think that all these efforts are to prepare the scene for hostilities in the autumn, when Bin Saud will excuse himself on the ground that he could not control his subjects and his own position would be so pre carious if he refused to go to war, that he had no recourse but to do so, witness the complaints written to Government by his subjects, without his knowledge! j &gt; 7iH? re k ave been fairly persistent rumours lately of preparations among the Akhwan and consultations between the leaders and Bin Saud, and taxes throughout Nejd have certainly been collected with more than usual rigour.

It is to the effect that the Arabs have been disillusioned in regard to the promised independence, that the menace go the freedom of the JUuHties Arabs has not roused them to action but that NEJD, which so far has maintained it's Oherielalad independence and is devoid of atobition to annex territory outside her natural boundaries, is prepared to assist all who desire the liberation and unity of the Arabs. The Statement disapproves King Hussain's greedy assump tion of the Khalifate for which he is unqualified. It also expresses agreement with the Indian and Egyptian Musalmans that the Khalifate question should be decided by a congress thoroughly representative of Islam. In conclusion thanks are given to Indian Musalmans for their efforts in the defence of the Khalifate and for the independence of the JAZIRAT UL ARAB.

According to trustworthy information which is continually reaching us from various sources, His Excellency is taking steps through his official in IM1, the capital of the territory of Ibn Rashid, to advance ag^tinat the railway just as the honourable French Republic attacked the branch of that railway at Damascus an attack against which the Hejaz Government protested officially, as is known to His Majesty's Government.

I find it necessary to ask Your Excellency about the opinion of His Majesty's Government in this case, lest in our measures of defence we be compelled to advance. la this contrary to their views?

If the consequences appear serious for him he will however probably plead inability to control (due) either to (l) lack of funds since subsidy was cut off or (2) continued hostility of Shereefian fanily which his subjects could no longer bear.

Appreciation tf pr »nition in an foll§v;n - Invaders would proloaloly have takrn Mecca with little fighting and 'been welctmed 'by inhabitants if they had lollcwed up victory. Ma^acres have damped enthusiasm for ^ahahis 'but hare not strengthened defence* General tpinitn continues to be that Hedjaz could come to terms with miemy more easily if Hussain were removed hut action is not likely t» 'be taken to this end. Regular Army consists of few hundred indifferent troops domoralized 'by defeat to which may he added few hundred pressed men from Mecca who have no Officers and are appealing for rations to Jeddah merchants. Rifles are short and Amir Ali makes an uninspiring G.O.C. Trihes who are openly sitting on fence have driven no serious promise of help. Reasonable interpretation of tribal attitude is why fight against a for midable enemy for a King we hate when we may hope to conciliate former by calling ourselves Wahabis and joining in pillage or even by merely remaining neutral. If Wahabis had not had reason to believe that Hedjaz tribes would be at the worst neutral, it seems unlikely that they would have attacked ±vl Taif. It would seem that fahabis oould take capital if they attacked with three or four thousand men. Sverythintf depends on them therefore and we know nothing cf their intention beyond . threat which they told refugees to carry to Mecca, in my telegram Ho.50. Situation may change at any moment for the worst. On the other hand Wahabis may wait lon^ time before advancing as in Taraba. Early movement would presumably be was encouraged by the ease with which strong position of Taif^taken. It is most unlikely that Taif will be recovered by Hedjas during present ree-ime.

Tentative appreciation of various shades of Muslim opinion in India, which has not however yet Crystallised, refi-ardins- Wahahi threat to Holy Places, is as follows - Sober Muhammadans regard present developments as likely to lead to further disintegration of Islam. Khilafatists, however, welcome success of vTahabis openly and hope to succeed in securing satisfactory assurances from Bin Saud in regard to safety of Holy Places and Haj routes. They are raising outcry at prospect of British rendering assistance to Kin^r Hussein or otherwise inter- feri-:r in 'Civil War in Holy Land. Mussalmans generally vrould welcome King Hussein's removal from nverlordship of Hejaz, as they feel towards him deep-seated hostility which has 'been recently strengthened 'by exaggerated reports of pilgrims suffering this season and for the moment this-is dominant consideration among them. On other hand there is no genuine liking here for Wahalois owin/r to their past record and religious differences and it is expected that lar^e 'body of Sunni epinion would definitely assert itself against them if an advance on Mecca and Medina were accompanied loy usual process of destruction and desecration. Bin Saud himself though now hailed 'by extremists is suspect ^--politically in the eyes of many in view of his past acceptance of British subsidy. (Usual distribution, Kabul &amp; H.Ms.)1490.

AG^IT Am CONSUL Briianuio Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire, Foreign Office, ItOHDON. S.WfSSS&amp;Bst to oaptum: ot fklw . Buaiaiy® toad naws on August Sth that a force had RiyadlJ on Auguet 1st to attack Taif. Oa August v 17th, whan I ocesHumttd on tht« raport by telegraph, thera was still no news of a projected at tacit here. It was cm August 31 et that I first heard of a 'Wahabi* concentration near Taif. Shaikh Fuad, the Foreign Secretary, mentioned it when he paseed through on that date on hie way to Tehran, but not ag being more serious than usual* Had the King known how mtim® it wa@ he would have retained Shaikh Tuad, who would have been invaluable to him in euch a crisis. The Acting Foreign Secretary mentioned the report the next day on the telephone, and aaid that the Amir Ali had gone out to tranquillise the people. There was still nothing to show that the threat was more serious than in May (see my report for that month) shen the Russian airmen were sent out several tines to report and were asked - but refused ~ to drop bombs on the sMppo»edly hostile mQsmpmm%M On September 4tth the Hashi^ite Government informed m by letter (not by telephone or telegraph) that the Wahabis had taken and burned the palace of Sxssaihit, situated to the north-east of Taif. This was reported to His Majesty's Governs eat and to the Govermaent of India with the cogent that the outer / defences of the Hejas must have been penetrated, C^n the evening of Friday September 5th Taif was taken, the Hejas forces under the Amir Ali withdrawing first to Hadah, end later to Arafat. 3, The He J a* Govemaent at once telegraphed to me to ask His Majesty* s Government what steps should be taken •in(a). *in view of stuoh open ho«lillty ,, . fh*y wex&amp; quite unable to explain what kind of reply they thought Hi« Ma^eaty'a CJorernai mt oould git©. They wrote again later attributing their troubles to alleged as ur^aoee by His MaJ^iety'e Qoremmmt that Bin Saud would not attack and to HI is Majeety*® Govern® tint * a refusal to provide them with munition*? of war. When the ooneular corps telephoned to Meoca to inquire as to the safety of British subjects* we rsoeived the as^irano^ that foreigners would be protected as if they were He J ax subjects and would we l«t the Hejas Government have four aeroplanes on payment, 3, All the reports received in Jeddah, particularly one from the Sudan notable the Sharif Yusuf al Hindi, who made a special journey to Jeddah with the King 1 ® consent, and the King 1 # demands for advice, aeroplanes, munitions, etc., made it olaar that Mecca was in danger if the Wahabis in Taif cared to advance or another hostile force attacked from another direction. The regular army - euoh as it is - began to melt away* Mecca was known to be disaffected to King Hussein, and the tribe© to have been long tirod of his blockade policy* which kept them on very short rations in the hope of keeping Kejd short of supplies, and particularly angry at his gre^d, amounting this year to swindling, over the division of the money obtain ad from pilgrims for the Journey to Medina. If Mecca fell the administration of Jeddah would probably br^ak down, and in that case/ the tribes might possibly attack the town for the foodstuffs they so badly need. The only way of esoape for British and other foreign subjects fleeing from Mecca would then be closed. A preconcerted signal was therefore sent to the Sudan asking for the nearest sloop(3). Ill # alocp to oo»« over* H.M.B.•CUaiatls* arrived on Sept amber 10th* The French ar»®d yaoht •Diana* *ae already in port. S&amp;e had oome in t&amp;e previous day to take cm board a Freuoii Sudan see acouaed of ela^e tradix^ and ordered to be taken to Jibuti for trial, and was detained by the Aoting French Coneul until instruotions for her to remain until further orders could be received from Parie* Both ehipe are here etill. 4, The first feeling in Jeddah was of hardly concealed delight« the Hejaai townsman ie a mean-spirited and cowardly creature, whose most doughty dead is the swindling of a live pilgrim or the robbing of a dead one* Hie hatred of King Hueaein had hitherto been concealed under an effusive eervility, but at the eight of the Wanabie about, as he thought # fee set him free fro« King Hussein he b^an to talk treason boldly. The early rumours of the behaviour of the Wahabie at Taif were uniformly favourable to the®: they had ooisaiitted no excesses of any kind; there had not even bean any lootingj and when, on September 11th, the foreign consuls and the leading officials in Jeddah received a telegram from Mecca, signed by a large number of He^aais and foreigners but in reality, as was well knowrn, composed by the King&gt; accusing the Wahabis of desecration of the tomb of the Prophet's cousin, Abdullah ibn Abbas, and of looting, murder and other excesses, not a soul was prepared to believe the story. It is a necessary rule with all the foreign representatives here to believe no statement of King Huesein 1 ® until it is corroborated from some Independent source. The inhabitants of Jeddah observe the ®ame rule, end in addition they were animated by a most determined will to believe nothing but good of the Wahabis. Mecca was a little excited by the news anda faw people fled to JedU&amp;Ma, but er&amp;n there the anti- Hueeein fe^liiag wae too etrong and the belief In the possibility that exceeee/i had boen oommitted died a^ay. 5. The firet reliable aridenoe in ^ ort of the etory of pill^^ and murder wa» brought to ^eddah on September 10th by %he Javanese ifuhamadati, Shaikh Pravira, who is at present Acting Netherlands Consul. He had the evidence of Javanese pilgrims that gome of their people had been killed while they themselves had been robbed of all they possessed except their underclothes. Arabs could have given clearer evidence, but no refugees other than these few Javanese arrived for some little time. Sow the Javanese are notoriously ignorant of local affairs, and they had clearly fled very soon after the evacuation of Taif by the He J as forces. It was therefore thought that the assailants were possibly local ruffians who had profited by the interregnum and not the invaders at all. Moreover, these refugees were brought in from the front line by the King, in his car, and She suspicion could not be avoided that, ift the state of alarm and distress in which they arrived they might have been unwillingly inspired with the King^ views. H^vertfceless the information was reported to His Majesty^ Government and the Crovernment of India were asked whether in case of need refugees could be taken to Kamaran. The British,, French and Motherlands representatives suggested to their respective govermi ints that they should send to the laader of the occupying forces a letter expressing the hope that the interests of foreigners would be safeguarded. His Majesty t s Oovsrnmant approved the proposal that a letter should be sent but directed that it should be in the form of a warning. A letter in the sense prescribed was sent off by secret messenger on September 13th. It was(g) warn sigaod by me and by «y Netherlands colleague| instructlone authorising the Acting French Consul to sign were not received until Sept c^ber 13th. With the letter I sent one signad by ©ygelf alone, saying that ;news had been received that a certain British Indian was being held to ransoaa and protesting - subject to the truth of the report - against such conduct. 6. Uy greatest difficulty arose froM the fact that, being debarred from going to Mecca, I could not personally advise the large number of British subjects in permanent or temporary residence there. This was discussed with Mr M.Tasin Khan, the Indian Pilgrimage Officer, and he volunteered to go to Mecca to look after the interests of British subjects in general. He arrived there on September 14th. His instructions were (1) to endeavour to despatch, with the cognisance of King Hussein, duplicates of the two letters already sent to Taif by secret messenger; (3) to investigate the reports of piliag® and ^as'^acre, and (3) lo get into touch with the various British communities in Mecca, not only with the Indians, but with the Malays, Nigerians, and others as well. Pilgrims who had performed the HajJ were to be told that they would be well advised to go home in view of the economic difficulties incident to the situation; merchants and other residents who asked for advice must decide for themselvesi if, in case of need, they applied to the British Agency at Jeddah, they would be given such assistance as was possible and as the circumstances warranted. ?, When Mr Tasin Khan and Shaikh Fravira showed King Hussein the two letters which it was desired to send to the leader of the invaders the King said that the one signed by the British and Dutch representatives could not be\n b® aliowsd to pa®® out of th&amp; linas: the protest againet tiia holding of a British Indian to ransom might go it the form of addreee {•to the Leader of the Force which has occupied Talf') «iere changed and the aaae of the Wahabi leader inserted. It wae necessary to telephone to the King personally, and to say that he would be held Jointly responsible for any further harm suffered by British subjects at the hands of the invaders* before he would o cm sent to our despatching the Joint letter. As to the other letter I was compelled to insist on the retention of the forai of adciress I had used, since I hud no official information as to the identity of the attacking force or of their leader. As It turned out the discussion was academic, since Mr Tasin Khan was unable to find a messenger who would agree to go to faif, and in any case the King would probably have had him waylaid; but the discussion was useful in revealing King Hussein♦« views. He told me in so many words that he objected to the letter because it confined its representations to British subjects and said nothing about the Hejas* Fro® this and from other remarks it was quite clear that he was still expecting that His Majesty 1 s Ooverittent would pull him out of the pit he had helped so strenuously to dig for himself* 8. faif has three functions very valuable to Mecca: it is a strong natural position- it supplies the capital ' with the bulk of its fruit and vegetables; and it serves as a health resort. As a health resort it had been neglected for some years, owing to the Wahabi menace, but gradually more and mors of the wealthy Msccans resumed their old custom and this summer a very large number of families had installed themselves in their faif houses, among(7). amo&amp;g tiiaia two ox thr®a Indian families. There were also many pilgrims of various *ao««. Most of these were Javanese. a. Apart from the informtion obtained by Mr Yasin Khan in Mecca we hare now the evidence of many refugees from Taif «ho have come to Jeddah. The outlines of ths story are clear. When the Wahabi attack was threatening during the three or four days preceding the capture of the town many of the Mecca people asked for pariaissicn to leave. This was refused by the Qaiaisaqam^ tha Sharif Sharaf, on the ground that there was no danger&gt; and that their return to Mecca would cause a panic there. Many again wished to leave when the Amir Ali evacuated the town, but they were told that he was only going to bring up reinforcements. After the evacuation some of the people invitad the In spite of this, pillage and shooting began at once. Wahabi $ into the town and into their houses. 7 Everything of value was taken, even to the outer garments: men and women were left with nothing but their underclothes. The Mecca people had with them many fine Carpets, much money (in this country money is hidden in the uouse rather than deposited in a bank), and enormous quantities of jewellery. Everything was taken. If a man, hesitated to produce his money and valuables, or was suspected of trying to conceal any, he was shot at once. Some families have lost five or six men. Most of the people who survived the massacre were sent to the palace of Shubrah, an enormous building standing in a very large garden Just outside the town walls. There they remained for four days, living on fruit. ^hen the corpses were already swollen and putrifying about thirty of the survivors Were compelled to remove them; they were given mules and ropes by which to drag the bodies away. Four days(8). jib days after th&amp; captiuf® of th* town tlas Mecca refugeee collected in the Shubrah garden were ordered to return to Mecca, ©even men only being kept until a eua of £i # 000 should fee paid for eacii* They were ordered to cornrey a message to the people of Mecca, to the effect thai the Wahabie were ooffiing and would treat t^em as Taif had been treated unless tfcey got rid of the 'Sharif 11 (King Huaaeia), w.uo was referred to as Abu Khishah i.e. 'The Chap in the Gunny Bag 8 , or 'Him in the Sack'. They left on foot, in their underclothes and barefooted. A aaiall quantity of grain wag given them by the Wahabis but not enoqgh to go round. One, an Indian, had managed to conceal two pounds and was able to buy food on the way. A few died of exhaustion on the journey. 10. There is evidence that the Invaders showed religious fanaticism. They constantly addressed their victims as Kuffar (infidels) and Mushrikin (those who Join others with God i.e. polytheists), and made many repeat the Wahabi formula* It appears that instead of 'There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the prophet of Allah' the Wahabis say 'There is no God but Allan alone; he has no companion'• To this they sometimes add: 'and Muhammad is his slave and his prophet'. They consider that the reverence shown by the Sunni for Muhammad savours of idolatry. It is alleged that the Wahabis demolished the tomb of Abdullah ibn Abbas cousin of the Prophet, but this, though widely believed and quite probable, is not well authenticated. It is believed now that most of the invaders belong to the Buqum and Ataibah tribes. The military success and the enormous booty won by these fairly recent converts are likely to win other tribes to the Wahabi tenets* 11. The local estimate of non-combatant» killed by the Wahabis is from five to eight hundred. It is probable(9). that 0«m« two hundred wer« kill ad.

He is said to nave been born in the Hejas. 12. A Syrian general who was with the Hashimite forces in Taif states that the Amir An decided to evacuate the town before he had lost a single man. There may be some jealousy in this, but it is certain that the Hashimite army did not make a very desperate resistance. At the moment of writing the Amir Ali is advancing on taif in(10). the h0 ^ q£ it, and of factor® agAin»t hiai must be tli® oam© with wiiioh &amp;$ was drivea out a fortaigJit ago.

The Mecca people w@re at first unwilling to furnish any recruits, but the higher rates of pay which the Amir Ali seems to have compelled his father to promise, or the realisation of the truth of the new# of pillage and masaaore, or some other cause, has secured wt few hundred recruits from the two best figh&amp;ing elements in Mecca: the men of Hadhramaut origin end the men of the Havas Quarter, Buw everything depends upon the tribes, and so far no considerable body of tribal support seems to hare been even promised. That the tribes are on bad tttms with King Hussein must be very well tea own to the Wahabis: indeed, it is reasonable to suppose that taif would hardly have been attacked if resistance from the tribes as well as from the Hasnimite army had been anticipated. Hews received at the last moment before the typing of this despatch states that the Amir Ali has now with him about 3,000 tribesmen. These are however not from the bigger tribes e.g. Harb, but Bani Sufyan (a sub-tribe of the Ban! Th^if living near Taif), and odds and onds scraped together by the Sharif®, who fear that the family will be wiped out if the Wahabis take Macoa, from their personal following among the small local tribe« e .g.

If a vary few of the senior offioiale be exempted it may be eald that the oapture of Taif roused universal entnusiasm* The 'war** was regarded ae a personal struggle Bin Baud Sing Hussein, and as a happy oooasion by which the latter might be got rid of* The inhabitants of Meooa and Jeddah now say that but for the news of the isaseaores uhey wuuld hare deposed King Hussein. I much doubt whether bheir oourags would have risen to this, but at loast they were oonfidmt that# if Hussein oould somehow omm to be king, either they could have corns to verms with Bin -aud or, at the worst, they could fight the Wahabis with easy isiads, knowing that their victory would no - fix Sing Hussein's yoke iwore firmly on their shoulders; and this conviction is not dead yet. Both Mecca and Jeddah showed a spirit of indspend^ncs which was completely lacking before. Jeddah torn haul hitherto been administered by the King, by telephone, down to the most trivial detail,but it now runs itself. So man had aver darad to question the wisdom of an order, but when the public refused to accept ths King's new coinage, believing that the Wahabis would coae and render It worthless, and the King wished to force1*® da). foro® It on ttaaa, th« leading officials anU asroiiattta b ® i ox ) X®4. thfe withdranrai of the ordeje, aiid th&amp; Dixeotor General of Customs on his own, responsibility isaued gold md Turkish &amp;llr$r ia. ^xohange tor tha King*is copper* K«oo&amp; is said to hfltve deoidsd at last that th@ slow wretchedness of the rule of King Hussein is preferable to vhat Qt the ffahabis, but this seemg to apply almost exclusively to the richer class, which lost so mmy men and so much property at Taijtt the poorer people have no property to lose in a raid and little faar of being killed, whereas they suffer daily hardships from King KusBein t s gre«d and from his foolish economic policy* Jeddah is at a loss, fsaring about equally the arrival of the Wahabis, the success of King Hussein, and an interval of disorder when the local tribes Might come in arid loot the town. They have therefore worked themselves inlio the belief that the foreign powers must protect Jeddah, and the wildest rumours - most of them based on ihe supposition that His Majesty 1 s Goverrjmsnt would intervene - have bsen afloat. I believe, however, that the attitude of complete neutrality adopted by the consular corps is beginning to convince tnem that His Majesty*a Government and the other foreign powers are interested in the struggle only in so far as it affects the rights and interests of their nationals. 14 # Whsn the crisis oame, King Hussein 1 ® first stc^p was to cl^acur for advice from His Majesty 1 # Government and to make the false statement that they had promised him he should not be attacked. He clearly expected more than advice, for when I reminded the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs how, according to the local press (written by the King), the Trans-Jordanian tribes had(13). had recently beatan off a W&amp;habi attack, ling HuBsein wrote to fay that the attaoJc wan only repulsed by mean® of British aeroplanes and tanks. Yet only a month or so earlier he had informed Hie Majeety*« Government that the Mir of Trans-Jo rdania wae a^minietcr ing that territory on behalf of the Mecca Government• How little he hae done to oonciliate Bin Sand is well known. He has endeavoured to starve the Hejd tribes by limiting to a quantity quite inadequate even for hie own people the amount of foodetuffs and other neoessariee which might be taken out of the town® of the Hejas, and although this measure wae rescinded when he took the title of Caliph it ha@ been applied in practice with little if any modification. For «everai years he refused to allow lejdis to come to Mecca on the pilgrimage. He was personally discourteous to Bin Baud: he always refers to him as His Excellency instead of as His Highness* and on receiving from him a letter couched in very friendly language and bearing the full title of King of the Hejaa, he #ent a curt reply beginning '0 Excellencyi* - a form of address which he ^ould embroider if he were writing e*g» to his own Director of Customs. He openly claimed that the first Step towards peace in Arabia was the restoration of pre- war boundaries. This was to apply to all Arab rulers in the peninsula except himself: he by no means desired to be limited, as before the war* to tae town of Mecca&gt; but Bin Saud was to give up his conquests, and the houses of Bin Hash id, at Hail, and of A.1 Aidh&gt; at Ibha, were to be re-established (this programme he published in his own newspaper only a few months ago), He ocaistantly described himself a« 'King of the Arab L^nds', as though he were the only King. And finally he took the title of(u) of Caliph ♦ fhlB last »t«|&gt; Bin SauM* an opportmiiiy, which h@ qnloiay seized, to win tlie support of soa© of th« Indian Caliphate leaders. TJa© ^Bombay Chronicle' has bean printing lettere from him for some months, said describing him in article® as the man who really has Arab unity, the liberation of Arabia from European domination, and Muslim interests in general, at heart♦ On the other hand by his Caliphate policy and his treatment of pilgrims King Hussein has alienated all the important Muhammadan co&amp;munitiee except those of Syria, Palestine and Ira%&gt; whose adhsrenoe Is due partly to racial but mainly to political considerations. Being disappointed in his hope that His Majesty's Government would intervene to save him from Bin Saud, he would have been in a desperate situation if the Wahabis had not put themselves in the wrong by the ejtcessee coaautted at Taif• the Xing at once telegraphed a protest all over the world, obtaining afterwards the signature® of the people whose names he had affixed to the telegrams. Copies of the telegraass were Jisnt to the foreign consuls in Jeddah, and we thought it necessary to send a reply eaying that although our governments must naturally be greatly distressed to hear of hostilities in the holy land of Islam, any foreign intervention was absolutely precluded by their well known principles and would moreover displeasing to the Muhammadan world. The telegram also gave us a useful opportunity to discourage people who have long lost their foreign nationality - sometimes for generations - but were expecting us to help them, by saying flatly that the figure of 30,000 foreigners mentioned in their telegram was grossly exaggerated, andand to infoxM xml TjMt iOBftli of our respective government® in M@coa tiiat if they applied to us tfeey would be afforded sucii protection as was possible and ae the oircuaistauoes! warranted. The reply to this, couofced in King Huaseiri 9 e well 3b), own style&gt; wae to this effect: Heaven forbid that European power© should , establish anything in the nature of a protectorate over the He^as; but what about the Kftweit Conference, which was held under the presidency of a British official? This naive appeal having had no effect King Huaaein was thrown on hia own reeoureas. He recovered a little from the panic of the fxret moeient, when a few Wshabi© could have walked into Mecca to the applause of the population, and began to tfy to win support for a policy of resistance - a policy which the Wahabis* conduct did something to advance. Two of his stea&amp;ers are under orders to be ready to leave at IS hours notice, and a quantity of specie h%B bom put on board one of them (the yacht), but he regains at his post in Mecca, and at the preesnt moment his army, such as it is, is moving towards Taif. 15. Whatever happens the prospect is glooeay. If King Hussein retakes Taif he will be even more obstinate and vainglorious than before. His people, who ventured to show their hostility to him when Taif was first captured, will feel the weight of his anger, and both they and the pilgrims will be bled even more than before to produce money for defence; and he is likely to be particularly hostile to British interests, in revenge for the disappointment of his hopes that they would support him against Bin Saud. And all the time there will be the Menace of another attack from the desert. If the Wahabis(16) WahaJDi® should take ISeooa would be taa ijmi«dlatt difrioulti^s raaultiag from tk flight of laxga number® of of all kinds to th® aoast aad fxom tiio temporary partly«i« of administration in Jaddda, and th© longax-Xivsd complication© arising from the difference betweon ths t en®t s of the Wahabi a swad thocssj of the bulk of the pilgrims. If things raaalm a® they ar@, with Taif part of I@Jd and Mecca part of the fi^a» # the present at at 3 of instability may be prolonged Indefinitely, The Wahabis isould be within striking distance of the pl&amp;ce of pilgrimage at Arafat, aad of the source of the famous Ain Zubaidah, near by, which in eer.ential to Mecca when the town is full of pilgrime.

The rumour does not in itself seem very plausible, for no great importance is attached in Egypt to King Hussein f s pretensions to tlp/e Caliphate, and, if ambitions in that direction are perhaps not wholly absent from King Puad's mind, it appears that similar propaganda is being done on behalf of Ibn Saud. 3. It is suggested that the feelings of the Egyptian Government, and particularly of King Fuad, against King Hussein, which are reflected in the Egyptian press, may have oeen seized upon and con verted into 'this specific rumour by agents of Ibn Saud.

W., No. 95-11-1, dated Jeddah, the 21st September 1924. I have the honour to enclose a rather hastily compiled report on the Taif incident. 2. Copies of this despatch are being or will shortly be sent to India, Singa pore, Egypt, Khartoum (through Port Sudan), Jerusalem, Bairut (for Damascus), Baghdad, Bushire, Koweit, Bahrain and Aden. 3. The refugee question will be dealt with in a separate despatch, copies of which will be sent to India and Singapore only: j . ... , • ; : ' —————— i ^ THE CAPTURE OF TAIF. Bushire had news on August 8th that a force had left Riyadh on August 1st to attack Taif. On August 17th when I commented on this report by telegraph, there was still no news of a projected attack here. It was on August 31st that I first heard of a ' Wahabi ' concentration near Taif. Shaikh Fuad, the Foreign Secretary, mentioned it when he passed through on that date on his way to Tehran, but not as being more serious than usual. Had the King, known how serious it was he would have retained Shaikh Fuad, who would have been invaluable to him in such a crisis. The Acting Foreign Secretary mentioned the report the next day on the telephone, and said that the Amir Ah had gone out to tranquillise the people. There was still nothing to show that the threat was more serious than in May (see my report for that month) when the Russian airmen were sent out several times to report and were asked—but refused—to drop bombs on the supposedly hostile en campment. On September 4th the Hashimite Government informed me by letter (not by telephone or telegraph) that the Wahabis had taken and burned the palace of Suwaihit, situated to the north-east of Taif. This was reported to His Majesty's Government and to the Government of India with the comment that the outer defences of the Hejaz must have been penetrated. On the evening of Friday Sep tember 5th, Taif was taken, the Hejaz forces under the Amir Ali withdrawing first to Hadah, and later to Arafat. 2. The Hejaz Government at once telegraphed to me to ask His Majesty's Government what steps should betaken 'in view of such open hostility '. They were quite unable to explain what kind of reply they thought His Majesty's Govern ment could give. They wrote give later attributing their troubles to alleged assurances by His Majesty's Government that Bin Saud would not attack and to His Majesty's Government's refusal to provide them with munitions of war. When the consular corps telephoned to Mecca to inquire as to the safety of British subjects, we received the assurance that foreigners would be prot'ected as if they were Hejaz subjects and would we let the Hejaz Government have four aeroplanes on payment. 3. All the reports received in Jeddah, particularly one from the Sudan notable the Sharif Yusuf al Hindi, who made a special journey tor Jeddah with the King's consent, and the King's demands for advice, aeroplanes, munitions, etc., made it clear that Mecca was in danger if the Wahabis in Taii cared to advance or another hostile force attacked from another direction. The regular army—such as it is— began to melt away. Mecca W8 s known to be disaffected to King Hussein, and the tribes to have been long tired of his blockade policy, -which kept them on very short rations in the hope of keeping Nejd short of supplies, and particularly angry mc643fd2 at his greed, amounting this year to swindling, over the division of the money ob tained from pilgrims for the journey to Medina. If Mecca fell the administration of Jeddah would probably break down, and in that case, the tribes might possibly attack the town for the foodstuffs they so badly need. The only way of escape for British and other foreign subjects fleeing from Mecca would then be closed. A preconcerted signal was therefore sent to the Sudan asking for the nearest sloop to come over. H. M. S. ' Clematis ' arrived on September 10th. The French armed yacht ' Diana ' was already in port. She had come in the pre vious day to take on board a French Sudanese accused of slave trading and order ed to be taken to Jibuti for trial, and was detained by the Acting French Consul until instructions for her to remain until further orders could be received from Paris. Both ships are here still. 4.- The first feeling in Jeddah was of hardly concealed delight. The Hejazi townsman is a mean-spirited and cowardly creature, whose most doughty deed is the swindling of a live pilgrim or the robbing of a dead one. His hatred of King Hussein, had hitherto been concealed under an effusive servility, but at the sight of the Wahabis about, as he thought, to set him free from King Hussein he began to talk treason boldly. The early rumours of the behaviour of the Wahabis at Tajf were uniformly favourable to them: they had committed no excesses of any kind ; there had not even been any looting; and when, on September 11th, the foreign consuls and the leading officials in Jeddah received a telegram from Mecca, signed by a large number of Hejazis and foreigners, but in reality, as was well known, composed by the King, accusing the Wahabis of desecration of the tomb of the Prophet s cousin, Abdullah ibn Abbas, and of looting, murder and other excesses, not a soul was prepared to believe the story. It is a necessary rule with all the foreign representatives here to believe no statement of King Hussein's until it is corroborated from some independent source. The inhabitants of Jeddah observe the same rule, and in addition they were animated by a most determined will to believe nothing but good of the Wahabis. Mecca was a little excited by the news and a few people fled to Jeddah, but even there the anti- Hussein feeling was too strong and the belief in the possibility that excesses had been committed died away. 5. The first reliable evidence in support of the story of pillage and murder was brought to Jeddah on September 10th by the Javanese Muhammadan, Shaikh Pravira, who is at present Acting Netherlands Consul. He had the evidence of Javanese pilgrims that some of their people had been killed while they themselves had been robbed of all they possessed except their underclothes. Arabs could have given clearer evidence, but no refugees other than these few Javanese arrived for some little time. Now the Javanese are notoriously ignorant of local affairs, and they had clearly fled very soon after the evacuation of Taif by the Hejaz forces. It was therefore thought that the assailants were poss bly local ruffians who had profited by the interregnum and not the invaders at all. Moreover, these refugees were brought in from the front line by the King, m his car/and the suspicion could not be avoided that, in the state of alarm and distress in which they arrived they might have been unwillingly inspired with the King's views. Nevertheless the information was reported to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India were asked whether in case of need refugees could be taken to Kamaran. The British, French and Netherlands representatives suggested to their respective governments that they should send to the leader of the occupy ng forces a letter expressing the hope that the interests of foreigners would be safeguarded. His Majesty's Government approved the proposal that a letter should be sent but directed that it should be in the form of a warning. A letter in the sense prescribed was sent off by secret messenger on September 13th. It was signed by me and by my Netherlands colleague ; instructions authorising the Acting French Consul to sign were not received until September 15th. With the letter I sent one signed by myself alone, saying that news had been received that a certain British Indian was being held to ransom and protesting—subject to the truth of the report—against such conduct. ,. 6 - My greatest difficulty arose from the fact that, being debarred from going to .Mecca, I could not personally advise the large number of British subjects ia permanent or temporary residence there. This was discussed with Mr. M. Yasia MC643FDfci^ioS ? nd 116 ™ lunteerea to g° to Mecca to l e ok 14 th lU^tmctiors^rc Tn f ^ general - ? e arrived tllere on September ,. : | instructions were (1) to endeavour to despatch, with the comisance of King Hussein duplicates of the two letters already seut to Taif W ger ; (2) to investigate the reports of pillage and maLcre, and (3) to ^t into touch M a r us ? rltlsh oomm^ities in Mecca, not only with the Indies but Hat SoTe 'J^rrth^ W f - .

WW and Shaikh. Pravira showed King Hussein the two letters which it was desired to send to the leader of the invaders the King said that the one signed by the British and Dutch representatives could not be allowed to pass out oi the Hejaz lines : the protest against the holding of a British Indian to ransom might go it the form of address (' To the Leader of the Force which has occupied Taif ) were changed and the name of the Wahabi leader inserted. It was necessary to telephone to the King personally, and to say that he would be heid jointly responsible for any further harm suffered by British subjects at the hands of the invaders, before he would consent to our despatching the joint letter. As to the other letter I was compelled to insist on the retention of the form of address I had used, since I had no official information as to the identity of the attacking force or of their leader. As it turned out the discussion was academic, since Mr. Yasin Khan was unable to find a messenger who would agree to go to Taif and in any case the King would probably have had him waylaid ; but the discus sion was useful m revealing King Hussein's views. He told-me in so many words that he objected to the letter because it confined its representations to British subjects and said nothing about the Hejaz. From this and from other remarks it was quite clear that he was still expecting that His Majesty's Government would pull him out of the pit he had helped so strenously to dig for himself. 8. Taif has three functions very valuable to Mecca : it is a strong natural posi tion , it supplies the. capital with the bulk of its fruit and vegetables j and it serves as a health resort. As a health resort it had been neglected for some years, owing to the Wahabi menace, but'gradually more and more of the wealthy Meccahs resumed their old custom and this summer a very large number of families had installed themselves in their Taif houses, among them two or three Indian families. There were also many pilgrims of various races. Most of these were Javanese. 9. Apart from the information obtained by Mr. Yasin Khan in Mecca we have now the evidence of many refugees from Taif who have come to Jeddah. The outlines of the story are clear. When the Wahabi attack was threatening during the three or four days preceding the capture of the town many of the Mecca people asked for permission to leave. This was refused by the Qaimmaqam, the Sharif Sharaf, on the ground that there was no danger, and that their return to Mecca would cause a panic there. Many again wished to leave when the Amir Ali eva cuated the town, but they were told that he was only going to bring up reinforce ments. After the evacuation some of the people invited the Wahabis into the town and into their houses. In spite of this, p llage and shooting began at once. Every thing of value was taken, even to the outer garments : men and women were left with nothing but their underclothes. The Mecca people had with them many fine carpets, much money (in this country money is hidden in the house rather than deposited in a bank), and enormous quantities of jewellery. Everything was taken,. If a man hesitated to produce his money and valuables, or was suspected of trying to conceal any, he was shot at once. Some families have lost five or six men. Most of the people who survived the massacre were sent to the palace of Shubrah, an enormous building standing in a very large garden just outside the town walls. There they remained for four days, living on fruit. When the corpses were already swollen and putrifying about thirty of the survivors were compelled to remove them : they were given mules and ropes by which to drag the bodies away. Four days after the capture of the town the Mecca refugees collected in the Shubrah garden were ordered to return to Mecca, seven men only being kept until a sum of £l ,000 should be paid for each. They were ordered to convey a4 message to tlie people of Mecca, to the effect that the Wahabis were coming and would treat them as Taif had been treated unless they got rid of the ' Sharif ' (King Hussein), who was referred to as Abu Khishah, i.e., ' The Chap in the Gunny Bag ' or ' Him in the Sack.' They left on foot, in their underclothes and barefooted. A small quantity of grain was given them by the Wahabis but not enough to go round. One, an Indian, had managed to conceal two pounds and was able to buy food on the way. A few died of exhaustion on the journey. 10. There is evidence that the invaders showed religious fanaticism. They constantly addressed their victims as Kuffar (infidels) and Mushrikin (those who join others with God, i.e., polytheists), and made many repeat the Wahabi formula. It appears that instead of ' There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the pro phet of Allah ' the Wahabis say ' There is no God but Allah alone : he has no companion.' To this they sometimes add : ' and Muhammad is his slave and his prophet.' They consider that the reverence shown by the Sunni for Muhammad savours of idolatry. It is alleged that the Wahabis demolished the tomb of Abdullah ibn Abbas cousin of the Prophet, but this, though widely believed and quite pro bable, is not well authenticated. It is believed now that most of the invaders belong to the Buqum and Ataibah tribes. The military success and the enormous booty won by these fairly recent converts are likely to win other tribes to the Wahabi tenets. 11. The local estimate of non-combatants killed by the Wahabis is from five to eight hundred. It is probable that some two hundred were killed. To casual ties among the British Indians who happened to be in Taif are these • (1) Muhammad Sadiq son of Muhammad I^adim .. Held to ransom. (2) Muhammad Ismail son of Abdullah .. Do. (3) Mian Jamal (Baroda) .. .. .. Missing, believed killed. (4) Mian Ahmad (Baroda) .. .. .. . Do. Nos. (1), (3) and (4) were registered at this Agency. No. (2) was registered until 1914. The three persons mentioned below viz. (5) Mirza Abdul Rahman .. .. Killed. (6) Ahmad, son of No. (5) .. .. Do. (7) Amna, daughter of No. (5) .. Do. were at first believed to be British Indians, but none was registered, Nos. (6) and (7) were certainly born in Mecca, and it is probable that not even the father. No. (5), was born in India. It is said that there were also some Sindhis in Taif, and there is a story that the bodies of some of them were seen by the men who were made to bury the dead; but I can get no certain evidence of this. The total number of Ind ans n Taif who were certainly or very probably entitled to be considered as British subjects was about twenty. A certain Ali Johar ibn Hasan Johar who was killed was a wel 7 -known Calcutta merchant, but I am not sure about his nationality. He is said to have been born in the Hejaz. 12. A Syrian general who was with the Hashimite forces in Taif states that the Amir Ali decided to evacuate the town before he had lost a single man. There may be some jealousy in this, but it is certain that the Hashimite army did not make a very desperate resistance. At the moment of writing the Amir Ali is advancing on Taif in the hope of retaking it, and one of the factors against him must be the case with which he was driven out a fortnight ago. His force consists of perhaps 500 men which he brought from Medina, of whom most are West Africans ; per haps as many men oi the Mecca troops, consisting of Yemenis of the worst kind (the lowlanders), Hejazis (notorious for deserting with their rifles even in peace time) from the agricultural country towards Taif, and Takrunis who are nearly all unwilbng recruits. The Mecca people were at first unwilling to furnish any recruits,, but the higher rates of pay which the Amir Ali seems to have- compelled his father topromise, or tlie realisation of tlie truth, of the news of pillage and massacre, or some other cause, has secured a few hundred recruits from the two best fighting elements in Mecca : the men of Hadhramaut origin and the men of the Havas Quarter, But everything depends upon the tribes, and so far no considerable body of tribal support seems to have been even promised. That the tribes are on bad terms with King Hussein must be very well known to the Wahabis : indeed, it is reason able to suppose that Taif would hardly have been attacked if resistance from the tribes as well as from the Hashimite army had been anticipated. News received at the last moment before the typing of this despatch states that the Amir Ali has now with him about 2,000 tribesmen. These are however not from the bigger tribes, e.^., Harb, but Bani Sufyan (a sub-tribe of the Bani Thaqif living near Taif), and odds and ends scraped together by the Sharifs, who fear that the family will be wiped out if the Wahabis take Mecca, from their personal following among the small local tribes, e.g.y Bishah and Hudhail. As to the defence the Wahabis can make it is impossible to make a forecast of any serious value. Their numbers are still unknown. The force which captured the town was probably not much over a thousand, and the e is no reliable news of the arrival of reinforcements. And probably they are not too well supplied with cartridges. Artillery is not likely to play a large part in the struggle. The road to Taif is steep and bad, and moreover the guns are being kept, it is stated, for the defence of Mecca. 13. That the Hejaz is not yet animated by a spirit of patriotism has been fully proved by the events of this fortnight. If a very few of the senior officials be ex cepted it may be said that the capture of Taif roused universal enthusiasm. The war ' was regarded as a personal struggle between Bin Saud and King Hussein,, and as a happy occasion by which the latter might be got rid of. The inhabitants of Mecca and Jeddah now say that but for the news of the massacres they would have deposed King Hussein. I much doubt whether their courage would have risen to this, but at least they were confident that, if Hussein could somehow cease to be king, either they could have come to terms with Bin Saud or, at the worst, they could fight the Wahabis with easy minds, knowing that their victory would not fix King Hussein's yoke more firmly on their shoulders : and this conviction is not dead yet. Both Mecca and Jeddah showed a spirit of independence which was completely lacking before. Jeddah town had hitherto been administered by the King, by telephone, down to the most trivial detail, but it now runs itself. No man had ever dared to question the wisdom of an order, but when the public re fused to accept the King's new coinage, believing that the Wahibis would come and render it worthless, and the King wished to force it on them, the leading officials and merchants secured the withdrawal of the order, and the Director General of Customs on his own responsibility issued gold and Turkish s Iver in ex change for the King's copper. IMecca is said to have decided at least that the slow' wretchedness of the rule of King Hussein is preferable to that of the Wahabis, but this seems to apply almost exclusively to the richer class, which ost so many men and so much property at Taif: the poorer people have no property to lose in a raid and little fear of be : ng killed, whereas they suffer daily hardships from King Hussein's greed and from his foolish economic policy. Jeddah is at a loss, fearing about equally the arrival of the W^habis, the success of King Hussein, and an interval of disorder when the local tribes might come m and loot the town. They have therefore worked themselves into the belief that the foreign powers must protect Jeddah, and the wildest rumours—most of them based on the supposition that His Majesty's Government would intervene—have been afloat. I believe, however that the attitude of complete neutrality adopted by the consular corps is beginning to convince them that His Majesty's Government and the other foreign powers are interested in the struggle only in so far as it affects the rights and in terests of their nationals. 14. When the crisis came. King Hussein's first step was to clamour for advice from His Majesty's Government and to make the false statement that they had promised him he should not be attacked. He clearly expected more than advice, for when I reminded the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs how accord- ino-to the local press (written by the King), the Trans-Jordanian tribes had recently beaten off a Wahabi attack. King Husse n wrote to say that the attack was only repulsed by means of British aeroplanes and tanks. Yet only a6 month or so earlier he had informed His Majesty's Government that the Am'r of Trans-Jordania was administering that territory on behalf of the Mecca Govern^ ment. How little he has done to conciliate Bin Saud is we I known. He has endeavoured to starve the ISTejd tribes by limiting to a quantity quite inadequate even for his own people the amount ol : foodstuffs and other necessaries which might be taken out of the towns of he Hejaz, and although this measure was rescinded when he took the title of Caliph it has been applied in practice with litt'e if any modification. For several years he refused to allow Nejdis to come o Mecca on the pilgrim ige. I e wa ? personally discourteous to Bin Saud : he always refers to him as His Excellency instead of as His Highness, and on receiving from him a letter couched in very friendly language and bearing the full title of King of the Hejaz, he sent a curt reply beginning ' 0 Excellency '!—a.form of address which he would embroider if he were writing, e.g., to his own Director of Customs. He openly claimed that the first step towards peace in Arabia was the restoration of pre-war boundaries. This was to apply to all Arab rulers in the peninsula except himself: he by no means desired to be limited, as before the war, to the town of Mecca, but B n Saud was to give up his conquests, and the houses of Bin Rashid at Hail, and of A1 Aidh, at Ibha, were to be re-established (this programme he published in his own newspaper only a few months ago). He constant y des cribed himself as ' King of the Arab Lands,' as though he were the only King. And finally he took the title of Caliph. This last step gave Bin Saud an oppor tunity, which he quickly seized, to win the support of some of the Indian Caliphate leaders. The ' Bombay Chronicle ' has been printing letters from him for some months, and describing him in articles as the man who really has Arab unity, the liberation of Arabia from European domination, and Muslim interests in general, at heart. On the other hand by his Caliphate policy and his treatment of pilgrims King Hussein has alienated all the important Muhammadan communities except those of Syria, Palestine and Iraq, whose adherence is due partly to racial but mainly to political considerations. Being disappointed in his hope that His Majesty's Government would intervene to save him from Bin Saud, he would have been in a desperate situation if the Wahabis had not put themselves in the wrong by the excesses committed at Taif. The King at once telegraphed a protest all over the world, obtaining afterwards the signatures of the people whose names he had affixed to the telegrams. Copies of the telegrams were sent to the foreign consuls in Jeddah, and we thought it necessary to send a reply saying that although our governments must naturally be greatly distressed to hear of hostilities in the holy land of Islam, any foreign intervention was absolutely precluded by their well known principles and would moreover be displeasing to the Muhammadan world. The telegram also gave us a useful opportunity to discourage people who have long lost their foreign nationality—sometimes for generations—but were expecting us to help them, by saying flatly that the figure of 20,000 foreigners mentioned m their telegram was grossly exaggerated, and to inform rea. nationals of our respective governments in Mecca that if they apphed to us they would be afforded such protection as was possible and as the circum stances warranted. The reply to this, couched in King Hussein's well known style, was to this effect: Heaven forbid that European powers should establish anything m the nature of a protectorate over the Hejaz ; but what about the Koweit Conference, which was held under the presidency of a British official ? This naive appeal having had no effect King Hussein was thrown on his own resources. He recovered a little from the panic of the first moment, when a few Wahabis could have walked into Mecca to the applause of the population, and began to try to win support for a policy of resistance—a policy which theWahabis' conduct did some thing to advance. Two of his steamers are under orders to be ready to leave at 12 hours notice, and a quantity of specie has been put on board one of them (the yacht), but he remains at his post in Mecca, and at the present moment his army, such as it is, is moving towards Taif. 15. Whatever happens the prospect is gloomy. If King Hussein retakes Taif ie will be even more obstinate and vainglorious than before. His people, who ventured to show their hostility to him when Taif was first captured, will feel the weight of bis anger, and both they and the pilgrims will be bled even more than beiore to produce money for defence ; and he is likely -to be particularly hostile to ritish interests, m revenge for the disappointment of his hopes that they would1833. relepram R.

The majority of the correspondence is between Reader Bullard, the British Agent in Jeddah, the Political Residency in Bushire, the Political Agency in Bahrain, the Political Agency in Kuwait, the High Commissioner in Baghdad, the Colonial and Foreign Offices, both in London, the High Commissioner in Jerusalem, the Government of India, and Ibn Sa'ud himself, or his representatives.Most of the volume covers events leading up to, and immediately after, the Ikhwan's capture of Taif, including Hussein ibn 'Ali's abdication and his son 'Ali's attempts to retain control of the Hejaz. There is a detailed report of the capture of Taif by Bullard (folios 186-201, 273-281). The documents reflect British concern with the reaction of Indian Muslims, with duplicates of correspondence regularly forwarded to numerous offices back in India. Some papers are about the effort to evacuate British Indian refugees and pilgrims from the region.Other subjects covered in the volume are:the build-up to and ultimate failure of the Kuwait Conference of 1923-24;King Fuad of Egypt's suspected financial backing of Ibn Sa'ud's takeover of the Hejaz;the defining of the Hejaz-Trans-Jordan border;the motivations and movements of St John Philby and Rosita Forbes, both of whom were thought to be trying to gain entryinto Central Arabia.Notable in the volume are a newspaper cutting from
