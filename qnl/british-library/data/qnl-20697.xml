FOREIGH 0 PFT CS, S. W. 1. 20th October, 1937. Dear Glauson, In continuation of Br en an' s letter to you of the 4th September under the ITo.W 15817/4173/a I have looked up the papers and it seems to me that it will be desiraole to show Fowle (i) conclusion (k) (iii) on page 7 of the minutes of the 295th meeting of the C.I.D., (ii) paragraphs 12 and 13 of the report of the interdepartmental committee which is annexed to C.I.D* paper 1324 B of May, and (iii) the Bill which is annexed to that report, particularly sections (1), (2) and (4). We should then point out to him that the U.K. regulations made under this Bill apply (speaking roughly) to everyone and everything in the United Kingdom and to British subjects, British aircraft and British ships in foreign countries, but the U.K.regulations do not apply in any shape or form to countries or territories to which the provisions of the Act can be extended by Order in Council and the provisions of the future Act can be extended by Order in Council inter alia to any country or territory being a foreign country or territory in which for the time being His Majesty has jurisdiction to the extent of His Majesty's jurisdiction therein. Therefore (l) the U, regulations will not apply to the Persian Gulf territories at all, (2) when the emergency arises an Order in Council will be passed vestin , in the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf the same power to make regulations to the extent of our jurisdiction therein as His Majesty possesses with regard to the United Kingdom under section/ auson, Esq., .dia Office. If ✓section (1). Therefore what Fowle ha,s to think about is 'what regulations it will be desirable to make in the case of an emergency in the different Persian territories. He can see from the regulations which are also annexed to the report the sort of regulations that are contemplated for the Lnited kingdom, but of course in a large measure these would be unsuitable for the Persian Gulf. -oeyond giTing the explanation indicated above, I do not tnini-c i could be of any help at a meeting with Fowle at the present stage. Conceivably, I might be able to help at a later stage when he and other persons concerned have given some preliminary thought as to what regulations they consider might De made in these circumstances in the Persian Gulf. I suggest therefore that it would be better for you to see him alone to begin with, though it you think you want me I will endeavour to assist. Ever yours , (Sgd.) W.S.Beckett.25th October 1937. Dear Beckett, Would you kindly refer to your letter of the 20th. October to Clauson about the question of war emergency legislation in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. We had already shown Fowle the papers to which you refer and / T ^ P' U • ± am asked to send you a copy of a note in which he has recorded his views. In paragraphs 8 (4) and 16 (a) he indicates the matters which he thinks should be covered by emergency legislation, that is, by regulations under an Order in Council (which should no doubt be the Order contemplated in the proposed Bill and not any of the existing Orders). We do not feel quite happy about one or two of his suggestions, but we should be very grateful if you could examine his note in the first place. Powle is coming to the Office daily this week and will be available in London for a fortnight thereafter. If you think a discussion would help o-l e and 1 will be glad to come over at any time you wish to fix. I gather that I'owle thinks that in his sphere the real trouble in time of war is more likely to come from the persons under the jurisdiction of the Sheikhs than fran those over 'whom aiis i ./Iajesty has jurisdiction. That is why in his note he gives attention to the problem of securing that the Sheikhs, as regards their own subjects and others under their jurisdiction, make the same offences punishable as are covered by the regulations under the emergency Order in Council. But I imagine that you are less directly concerned with this side of the question. Yours sincerely, cett, Esq., .-eign Office. ( S d.) J.P.GIBS01T.SECRET. '— WAR EMERGENCY LEGISLATION FOR THE PERSIAN GULP. The first point to consider is whether any War Emergency Legislation on the lines set forth in the Committee of Imperial Defence papers attached (though naturally considerably modified) is necessary, I think the answer undoubtedly 'yes'. In a major war the Gulf would 'be of considerable importance from the following points of view:- (a) Imperial air route to India and beyond. (b) Oil. (c) Political connections with the neighbouring States of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. (I am only concernedj of course, with the Arab States. My headquarters are at Bushire and Iran is, of course, a foreign country as are the other neighbouring States in the Gulf* Iraq and Saudi Arabia,) 2. With regard to (a), the Gulf is now the 'Suez Canal of the air' and the British air line, military and civil, runs through the Arab States. Any interference or cutting of these lines by hostile action of any sort would have very serious consequences. I am not an air expert but I imagine that, apart from the obvious step of taking possession of an aerodrome by an expeditionary force, much temporary inconvenience could be caused by cutting up an aerodrome in such a way as to make it impossible for planes to land, and more effective still, much delay could be caused by sabotaging the local supplies of fuel. With regard to (b), our present main supplies of oil from the Middle East come from Iran and Iraq, foreign countries not under our control. In time of war this has obvious disadvantages: one can imagine circumstances under which/2. which the supplies might 'be stopped temporarily at all events. Ihe present development ? therefore, of a large oil field in Bahrain and the possible development of other lields in the other Aral) States is of considerahle • importance since those States are under our control. At the same time, the very fact that these fields are of such imp or bance woiild undoubtedly draw to themselves the attention 0± an y foreign countries in case v/e were at war with them. With regard to (c), in the case of a major war, 'while we might reasonaoly expect that Iran, Iraq and Saudi Ax^aoia would either 'be on our side (we have a Treaty to that eiiect witn Iraq_) or at all events be 'benevolently neutral, it would be possible for hostile centres for espionage and propaganda to be set up in these States. 3. I have dealt with the above points, the relevance of which may not appear at first sight, in order to give some picture of the sort of hostile activities in the Arab States with which we would have to deal by war legislation. Before cooking one ? s hare, or even catching it, it is just as well to get some idea of what sort of hare one is to deal with. It will be seen from the above that roughly the sort of activities against which legislation has to be prepared are: - (1) Sabotage of aerodromes and fuel stores for aeroplanes. (2) Sabotage of oil fields and refineries. (3) Espionage and propaganda. 4. With regard to (l), there are aerodromes and fuel stores at Kuwait, Bahrain and the Trucial Coast (chiefly at Sharjah) and at Muscat, With/(3)/ With regard to (2) ? there is a large oil field and' refinery at Bahrain and possible oil fields at Kuwait, on the Trucial Coast, and in Muscat territory, with another possible refinery or two in one of these areas. bith regard to (o), the opportunities for propaganda would probably be larger than for espionage, but tnere would oe some scope for the latter as well, I have no doubt that various foreign governments have plans ready made for all' the above eventualities should the need arise. There have been various dubious visitors to the Arao States of late, e,g, the Proroks (/ide coirespondence ending with India Office letter 'Mh At * As No,P, Z, 5905/37 of the 17th September to Prorok) and the Lindts (my Express Letter No. 613-S of-the 11th August - P. Z. 5750/37). ^ U ' 5 ,f w 5. With regard to specific legislation to meet the above contingencies. Before we go any further the point has to be considered what is the status of the Arab States when H. M. G-. are at war. With regard to their position in the last war (1914-18) I have had a look at two bulky bound volumes, Nos. 3136, Parts 1 and 2, 1914. (There may be other correspondence on the subject.) Prom these ' volumes (vide flag 'A 1 in No.3136, Part 2) it appears that all we did, and then not until Turkey came into the war, was to send the Rulers concerned letters which:- (1) Informed them of the declaration of war by Turkey; (2) put forward the case against Turkey1 ) 4, (3) Promised the Rulers protection against aggression and only required from them that they should preserve peace and quiet in their territories, (4) In addition, in the case of Kuwait, asked for actual co-operation. (This was also asked for from Moharnmerah 'but since the latter is not an Arab State it does not come within the scope of this Note. ) Thus, unless it was assumed that Kuwait, Bahrain and the Trucial Coast States, 'by reason of 'being under our protection, were automatically at war technically they were not so though co-operation was asked for from one of them, i.e. Kuwait. (The argument of protection would not apply, of course, to Muscat which juridically is an entirely independent State, ) 6, The fact that the Aral) States were not at war (if the above assumption is correct) did not apparently make any difference to our war-time activities in those States and it might 'be argued that what served in 1914-18 would do again. Nowadays, however, the situation on the Arab side of the Gulf is very different to what it was in 1914. The air route and the oil fields have come into being since then and it is against interference with these (vide paragraph (3) above) that legislation is chiefly required, while the whole situation in the Arab States is more complicated than it was previously. Personally, I feel, therefore, that it would strengthen our hands considerably in regard to legislation (as in other directions) if, on the next occasion that H.M. G. are at war the Arab States were juridically in the same position. This aspect of the general problem might be further examined.(3)/ i \ SJ 5. 7. To turn to the specific question of war legislation. The sort of legislation that is required is given in paragraph 3 (l) ? (2) and (3) above, and is desirable in all the States concerned. Our juridical position, however, in the various States differs considerably, as follows - 8, Kuwa i t . (l). Here we have an Order in Council by which British and foreign (i.e. non-Kuwaiti) subjects are under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. Kuwaiti subjects (of course) and the subjects of Moslem foreign powers are under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh (vide Article 4 of the Order definition of a Kuwaiti subject read with Article 8 (ii)). e .g. Iraqi, Saudi and Iranian subjects are under the Sheikh. It will thus be seen that from the juridical point of view there are two classes of persons in Kuwait!- (a) Those under the jurisidction of the Political Agent; (b) Those under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. In regard to both classes, it is necessary to consider what judicial powers we already possess which might obviate further war legislation, (2). In regard to (a) the Order in Council applies to Kuwait the Admiralty Offences Acts of 1849 and 1860 (see Section 12 of the Order). Neither of the two Admiralty Acts would seem prima facie to cover hostile war activities but Article 12(2) of the Order in Council places the Political Resident in the position of a Governor of a Colony or British Possescion. The point as to whether either of these two Acts give any special powers to deal with hostile war activities might be examined further.6. (3). The Order in Council (see Schedule to the Order} also applies the Indian Penal Code to Kuwait and Chapter VI of that Code, Offences against the State, is worthy 01 note in the present connection. Thus, Sections 121-124 deal with the actual waging of war against H, M, G. Section 124-A might perhaps 'bo considered to cover propaganda as well as actual disaffection. Section 125 is a somewhat curious one as it limits the offence of waging war against a power in alliance or at peace with H. M, G-. to that power being an asiatic one. Sections 126 and 127 deal with depredations in the territories of any powers in alliance with H.M.G. Sections 128-130 deal with illegally setting free prisoners of war, (4). It will he seen, therefore, that the clauses of Chapter VI deal to some extent with hostile war activi-cies. These clauses do not, however, make specific mention of sabotage, espionage or propaganda and I think that a King's Regulation under Article 83 of the Order is necessary to cover these activities. This King's Regulation, which could be quite brief, would enact that it was an offence to commit an act of espionage or sabotage or indulge in propaganda or be found loitering in the vicinity of, or entering, any area which had been specified by the Resident as forbidden. Suitable penalties would be provided for. (This is merely a very rough indication of the scope of the King's Regulation which, of course, would have to be carefully worded.) When the King's Regulation v;as drafted it would be laid aside against an emergency and when and if required a telegram to the Political Resident to put it into force/7. xorcc v .ould 'be all tliat would 'be necessary, (5;. In regard to ('b) ? our main difficulty lies ■./ith this class of person since first they are under the Sheikh's jurisdiction and not the Political Agent's 3 ana second ? they are the class frorn. v/hich hostile agents would raost likely 'be drawn. For control over these we snould, I chink, have to depend on the co-operation of the Sheikh all the more so since it must be remembered tiiab tne ?oj.itical Agent has no machinery at his disposal (police, etc. ) for dealing with hostile agents, etc. Under the present Order in Council, for instance, and its accompanying King's .Regulations, any arrests of wanted persons under his, the Political Agent's, Jurisdiction have to 'be made -'by the Kuwait Police who hand them over to the Political Agent for trial. As you are aware, when.^vur we want the provisions of some King's Regulations to apply to persons under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh we get the latter to issue an alan (notice) to that effect and this could be the procedure in regard to the present proposed war legislation. The Sheikh would be required to publish an alan making the provisions of our King's Regulation applicable to persons under his jurisdiction with the same or similar penalties which would have to be carried out by him. This a lan would be drafted by us, put aside, and published simultaneously with our King's Regulation. 9. Bahrein . (1). Here we have an Order, in Council by which British subjects and all foreign subjects come under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. (Bahrein subjects, of course, remain under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh, vide Article 8 (l) and (2) of the Order.)(2). As in the case of Kuwait, paragraph 8 (3) above5 the Indian Penal Code has 'been arjplied to persons in Bahrain to whom the Bahrain Order is applicable (vide Schedule to the Order) but not the Admiralty Offences A c ts. (3). '.That is required in Bahrain is a King's Regulation and an ala n from the Sheikh (vide paragraph 8 (4) and (5) above), 10. Qatar . Here we have an Order in Council by which British subjects and foreigners are under the jurisdiction of the Political Agentj Bahrain, Qatar subjects (of course) and Moslem persons are under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh (see Article 4 of the Order read' in conjunction with Article 8), 11. Trucial Coast . Here we have no Order in Council and, therefore, no jurisdiction. When and if the Petroleum Concessions Ltd, begin their operations in earnest in this area we shall probably have to arrange, as at Qatar, for an Order in Council. This eventuality, however, as you are aware, may be some time hence as much preliminary spadework in the way of settling the details of the Sheikhs' boundaries etc., etc,, has to be undertaken, and I do not think that we ought to delay preparing war legislation, I suggest, therefore, that a 'blanket' Order in Council be drafted to cover all the Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast. It woul merely cover war legislation and would be identical with the Kuwait King's Regulation (see paragraph 8 (4) above). The question arises as to whether the Trucial Coast Sheikhs/9. Sheikhs should 'be asked for their consent 'before this Order is published. Technically, this would perhaps not seem to he necessary as our Gulf Orders in Council would appear to 'be based on 'grants, usage, sufferance, etc. ' and in an emergency it would naturally be quite impossible to go round to the Trucial Sheikhs asking them if they agreed or not to the Order in Council. It might be considered whether, in this Order in Council (since this is the first one our hands are free), it would not be possible merely for the duration of the emergency to put all classes, foreigners and Trucial Coast subjects, as well as British subjects, under our jurisdiction. 12. Muscat . (l). Here we have an Order in Council by which British subjects are under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent, Muscat subjects and all foreign subjects are under the jurisdiction of the Sultan. (See Article 8 of the Order. With reference to Article 8 (3), no State has agreed that their subjects should come under our jurisdiction. ). (2). What is reguired is a King's Regulation and an alan on the lines of the Kuwait King's Regulation and alan . (See paragraph 8 (4) and (5) above.) Both King's Regulation and alan w hen drafted would be put aside for the moment and published when reguired. 13. An alternative to the action suggested in paragraphs 8-12 above would be for one Order in Council to be issued as a war emergency measure to cover all the Arab States concerned, lock, stock and barrel, laying down;- (a) That the Order in Council would hold good for the/10. the period of the emergency only: O) That it would apply to all persons of all nationalities in the States including subjects of those States■ (c) That it would only cover the offences suggested for the Kuwait King's Regulation. (See paragraph 8(4) ah eve. ) This alternative would certainly 'be simple and could be applied with celerity a great advantage in the circumstances. There might not be much difficulty in applying it to the States concerned except Muscat which technically is completely an independent State. Anyhow, this point might be considered. 14. At some stage in the consideration of this question I presume that the Royal Air Force and Naval authorities who are specially interested in Gulf defence questions will be consulted, 15. I suggest that when this Note has been examined by you it might be sent across to the Foreign Office for Mr, Beckett's consideration for the meeting which will take place with him. 16. Since the above was typed I have had another look at the draft Bill and the draft Defence Regulations, Annexes 2 and 3 of attached C.I.D. papers, and I would like to make the following further remarks. (a) With regard to paragraph 8 (4) above dealing with the Kuwait King's Regulation which would form a model both for any alan and Orders in Council which had to be included. The following additional provisions should be included in the King's Regulation - references are to Article;:,11. Articles of the draft Defence Regulations. A clause to make hostile propaganda an offence (Article 38) and an omnibus clause ? perhaps the most important of all, to make it an offence for any person to do 'any act which is likely to assist the enemy or to prejudice public safety'' (Article 94). A clause to enable the Political Agent to declare any area a 'protected place' (Article l(l)). An omnibus clause to enable the Political Agent or the Resident to issue such orders or take such action as he thinks fit to preserve public safety and oraer (see Part II)c These two omnibus clauses put wide powers in the hands ox the local Political Authorities in the Gulx, but having regard to the local conditions which would prevail there in time of a major war ? it seems to me essential that they should possess them. (b) Penalties for breach of the King's Regulation will have to be carefully considered. In this connection see Article 97. (o) Article 4(d) of the draft Bill might assist the suggestion made in paragraph 13 above. (d) Re paragraph 10 above — Qatar. Here, though I omitted to say so ? the Admiralty Offences Acts of 1849 and 1860 (Article 12(l) of the Order) and the Indian Penal Code (scheduled to the Order) have been made applicable to Qatar. What is required is a King s ^ Regulation and an alan from the Sheikh (vide paragraph 8(4) J A* and (5) above). (SD. ) T. 0. POWLE 6th October, 1937.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 10th IT ovember 1937. ^ - We have 'been considering your letter ITo. P. Z. 6964/37 of October 25th to Beckett about the question of War Emergency Legislation in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, and I now enclose a copy of a minute by Beckett on the subject. We agree that it will be as well to take advantage of Fowle's presence in London to go into the question of precisely what powers and arrangements are necessary, having regard to local circumstances in the Persian Gulf and the exact interests which need protection. We think that the Service Departments should be in on the discussion as well. You ma}/ therefore like to consider arranging an interdepartmental meeting at the India Office to consider these preliminary aspects of the problem some time before Fowle has to return to the Gulf. Someone from, here (probably myself 1 will gladly attend. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) T.V.Brenan. /G Dear Gibson, .bs on , Esq. , India Office.MirUTE BY MR.BBCKBTT. The question of what regulations must 'be put in force in the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms to safeguard British interests there in war time is a question to be decided primarily and in the first place by Political and Service Departments and is not a question for a Legal Adviser. It depends upon what are the special British interests there which would require protection, the dangers against which they should be protected and what is the best way of dealing with them. Therefore it seems tome that the next action to be taken is for the India Office, while Sir T.C.Powle is still in England, to call a meeting to consider the question at which representatives of the Service Departments and the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office and perhaps Mr.Orchard should be invited to be represented or to attend. 2. There are, however, a certain number of points raised m Sir T.C.Powle's memorandum on which perhaps I can say something useful now. p f r 3. In paragraph 5 of his memorandum, Sir T.C.Fowle raises, rightly I think, what must be a preliminary question for the consideration of the whole of this matter, namely, are we to consider these Persian Gulf sheikhdoms as neutral territories in a war in which His Majesty is engaged or being involved in the war as part of the British Empire ? In dealing with this question Muscat must be separated from the others and dealt with later. As these principalities are British protected States enjoying no foreign relations with any other country and stand upon much the same footing as the Malay States or Zanzibar, the natural conclusion would be that m case of war they will be involved in the same manner as other/other British protected States. It would appear from Sir T.C.Fowle's memorandum that in fact in the last war we did not in an3^ way treat the territories of these rulers as neutral territories and that our actions there would have entitled any of our enemies in the late war to consider them as belligerent territory, though in fact the question whether they v/ere to 'be considered neutral or belligerent was never raised or decided in any direct and concrete form. Possibly the records of the Foreign Office or the India Office may throw further light on this point. In any case, as Sir T.C.Fowle correctly observes, in present conditions when the territories of these rulers are from the British point of view the Suez Canal of the air as well as being the sources of most important oil supplies, it would seem obvious that our action and conduct there must be such as to make it inevitable that any contention that the territories are neutral territories would be patently false, and that it would be impossible to keep up any fiction that they were in any respect neutral territory. I think therefore we should have to proceed on the assumption that they must be regarded as belligerent territories participating in the war in the same way as British territories in general. 4. The position of Muscat is different because it is technically an independent State enjoying relations with other countries besides His Majesty's Government, but in fact our influence with the ruler of Muscat is so preponderant that I presume that if we found it necessary to do so, we should put pressure on him to declare war and come into it as an ally of the British iCmpire. I do not know, however, that the practical considerations involved would 1 saa.3. 6./ lead us to take this course. There is the 1862 declaration ^.itn Fra.nc e to be ta,ken into consideration in this connexion. ^ P. ^ - A ^ ] J\ /' •' 5. v/ion reference to paragraphs 8 to 10, where 3ir T.C.Powle deals'with Koweit, Bahrein and Qatr, I think m supposing that the new regulations which have to be maae will oe King's Regulations under the existing Koweit, ._^..n cxd v.a,tr Orders-in-Council as the case may be, he ui^lcoxcs tne fact that it is contemplated that new Ordsrs- nc_a. wo~t_d mcide under the future Act (which is still a 31x1) arld that tllsse Orders-in-Council would themselves .ibody oul^ or all of the new regulations required to be pu:c into force in the emergency. It is a matter for consideration whether we should have three new Orders-in- Council, one for each of these territories, or one applying to each of the three territories. In spite of the fact that there is a difference between the classes of persons who are subject to our jurisdiction in Bahrein on the one hand and Qatr and Koweit on the other, I think that probably one Order- ouncil could be made. If we proceeded in this way, it 'ould oe desirable I think in order to provide for ^-velopnents to include in the Order-in-Council the article gi 'ing the Political Resident power to make further regulations of the same kind by King's Regulation and to amend or repeal provisions of the regulations in the Order- 'n council by King's Regulation. The alternative procedure wou-d be that the Orders-in-Council made under the present BUI (future Act) would be short Crders-in-Council giving the Polluical Resident power to deal by regulation with all the matters which are covered by the Bill. He would then, acting under this Order, immediately make three new sets of King's Regulati ons.b. in any case the action taken would not 'be action under the King's Regulation articles of the existing Orders Therefore it is not necessary to consider in such detail as Sir T.C.Fowle does the extent to which his powers under the existing Orders are sufficient. The new Orders-in-Councij must of course provide that they and the regulations made thereunder override, to the extent of any inconsistency, the provisions of the existing Orders-in-Council and regulations made thereunder. It will of course 'be necessary in drafting the new Orders-in-Council and regulations to bear in mind the general legal system of the territories for which they are designed, viz. that laid down 'by the existing Orders-in-Counci.'. and the fact that we are legislating for territories where the ordinary law applied to British subjects through our tribunals is Indian law and not English law. 7. I agree with Sir T.C.Fowle that it will oe no doubt desirable that some or all of these emergency regulations are also made applicable to the persons in these territories who are not under our jurisdiction and that for this purpose the Political Resident will have to get the three rulers to legislate, making some or all of these regulations also enforcible through their own tribunals upon their own subjects and other persons subject to their jurisdiction. 8. It is then necessary to consider the case of Muscat and a preliminary question here is that already discussed above as to whether Muscat is going to be considered as being neutral or not. If Muscat is going to be considered to be neutral, then the regulations which we shall have to make for British subjects in Muscat will probably/probably be more limited than those made in the case of the other Persian Gulf territories, and I do not think we can expect the ruler to make them binding upon other peopie in Muscat. Our own regulations will have to be limited by the consideration that they are regulations to be enforced by us on neutral territory. If, on the other hand, Muscat is going to come into the war with us, then the matter can proceed upon much the same footing as in the other three territories and we can legitimately ask the ruler to enforce our regulations upon all the persons subject to his jurisdiction. A point, however, which has to be considered in this connexion is this. Is it not the case that the French and United States also possess consular jurisdiction over their nationals in Muscat, and if so do they exercise it ? 9. There remain the other sheikhdoms of the Trucial coast. Here, as Sir T.C.Fowle explains, we have no Orders-in-Council in force at the moment because we have never had any grant of jurisdiction from the rulers. Before the emergency arises, it is possible that we shall have received grants and made Orders-in-Council. To the extent that this is so, these territories will fall into the same class as Bahrein, Koweit and Qatr. We have to consider, however, the position on the assumption that these things have not happened. Sir T.C.Fowle suggests that we should, so to speak, arrogate jurisdiction to ourselves without any grant and when the emergency occurs enact the regulations for these territories by an ad hoc Order-in-Council. Though I appreciate the reasons why he suggests this, I do not think it will do. In the first place, the Order-in-Council which/which he envisages would have to be made either under the Bill (future Act) or under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. It could not, however, 'be made under the Bill as at present drafted 'because that limits the power to legislate hy Order-in-Council to the extent of the jurisdiction which we possess in the territory concerned and ex hypothesi Sir T.C.Fowle's proposal would mean legislating in a case where we had not got any existing jurisdiction. It could not be based under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act because we could not justify it on grounds of 'grant, usage, sufferance, etc.' The only way therefore we could do anything of this kind would be if we first annexed the territories of the rulers concerned or turned them at any rate into British colonial protectorates and this is a step which I think would have to be ruled out on political grounds. Therefore I think the only thing we can do in the case of these territories is that directly the emergency arises we should exercise our pressure and get immediate grants of jurisdiction from the rulers. Having done so, we should then immediately issue two Orders-in~ Council for these territories, one a general Order on the lines of the Qatr Order and the other an emergency Order-in- Council of the kind under consideration for the other Gulf territories. It may be said that this is rather a lot to undertake in a hurry in time of emergency, but I see no alternative. 10. I fear it would be impossible to adopt the ^ 9. w proposal in paragraph 13 of Sir T.C.'Fowle's memorandum. Unless we first obtained new grants of jurisdiction from, all the Rulers, the Order-in-Council suggested here would be/7 'be ultra vires our powers under rather the Foreign Jurisdiction Act or the new Bill. Further the Politic consequences in the sheikhdoms would surely 'be most undesirable.' 2. safety or tranquillity, a certificate signed by a Secretary to the Government of India or to the Local Government shall loe conclusive proof on the point.jmlr f''] SECRET. \l000&amp; MIMJTES OF A MEETING HELD AT THE INDIA CJ'FICS ON MONDAY, 15th NOVEMBER, 1937, TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF WAR EMERGENCY LEGISLATION IN THE ARAB SHEIKHDOMS OF THE PERSIAN GULF. prese nt:- Mr. J.

WALTON drew attention to Conclusion (k)(iii) on page 7 of the extract from the minutes of trie ^95th meeting of the C.I.D., held on 1st July, 1937, and said that the present meeting had been called in order to ascertain the preliminary views of the Service Departments in regard to the scope of the local regulations which would be necessary in order to provide xor ohe security of British interests and communications in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf in time of an emergency. He pointed out that any regulations made for the United Kingdom will not apply to the Persian Gulf territories at all, and that when an emergency arises it will be necessary t o pass an Order in Council (under Section of the Schuster Bill) making, or vesting in the Political Resident/Hesident in the Persian Gulf power to .make, such regulations as may he necessary in respect of the territories under his control. In this connection it was important to remember that under Section 4 of the Schuster Bill such Order in Council and the Resident's powers to make regulations thereunder will be limited to the 'extent of His Majesty's jurisdiction in the territories concerned' 1 , Mr. Walton thought, however, that it would be desirable that legislation oi the same scope as any emergency regulations made by the Political Resident shoula be made applicable to persons who are not under His Majesty's jurisidction. For this purpose it would be necessary, when the time came,, to obtain the Rulers' agreement to legislate by proclamation (alan) making the regulations enforceable through their own tribunals upon their own subjects and upon other persons subject to their jurisdiction. MAJOR GEO 'OR said that the Admiralty's chief interests in the Persian Gulf were the security of the naval bases at Bahrein and Khor Kuwai and the maintenance and protection of our oil fuel supplies. He thought c-hat it might bo necessary to make regulations in iegai d to the following:- (a) Shipping and lighthouses; (b) Contro1 of means of communicati on; .(c) Sabotage of oil fuel bases, etc. GROUP CAPTAIN SAUNUBY said that the Air Ministry were chiefly interested in keeping the air iougc open, both for Civil and Military aircraft. It would therefore be necessary to ensure that landing grounds, petrol and oil/oil 'bases, etc., were adequately protected from sabotage, etc. He also thought that it would be necessary to have close control over all foreign aircraft. SIR TRENCHARD FOWLE said that he agreed with Mr. Walton that it would be desirable to make the scope of the proposed emergency regulations applicable to all the inhabitants of the territories concerned. He would have preferred that if this could be done without prior consultation with the Rulers, which would inevitably lead to delays. Having regard, however, to the position under the Schuster Bill, he agreed that it would be desirable, as soon as the emergency Order in Council is made, 00 approach the rulers with a view to their taking parallel action. As regards the content of the regulations he thought that the greatest danger would be from sabotage on the part of persons not under our conorol, ana. ohciu early action ought to be taken to prevent this. He aia not think that there was much scope for espionage. In answer to a question from the Air Ministry representative he said that it was unlikely that there wocllu ud an^ difficulty in persua-ing the Rulers concerned to provide adequate guards at landing grounds, fuel depots, etc. He suggested that the proposed Order in Council might ue a short document on the lollowing lines.- (1) A clause empowering the Political Resiaenu bo declare certain areas as 'prohibited areas'; (2) A clause making it an offence to loiter m such areas; (3) A clause mating sabotage of any kind an offence; (4) A clause making espionage an ofj-enue,/ *4, ^ s (5) A clause making propaganda and subversive activities of any kind an offence; (6) A blanket clause giving the Resident full powers to take any necessary measures for the maintenance of public oraer and security, etc.; (7) A clause setting out the penalties. This clause would require careful consideration and would have to be aaapted to local conditions. MR. 3AGGALLAY agreed generally with Sir Trenchard Fowle's viewsj but asked whether the Political Resident had any powers to keep out undesirables. SIR TRENCHARI) FOWLE said that at present he had only power to deport persons who were under His Majesty's jurisdiction, MR. WALTON said that it might in any case be desirable to add a clause to the proposed Oraer in Council giving the Resident power in resx^ect of persons under His Majesty's jurisdiction to prohibit entry and to deport undesirables. As regards the extent ox this jurisdiction the present position, leaving aside Muscat lor one moment, was that we possessed jurisdiction over British suojecbs and, to the extent laid down in the respective existing Orders in Council, over certain classes O-i foreign nationals, in Kuwait, Bahrein and Qatar, m each case the Orders in Council had received the consent ox the Rulers concerned. As regards the Trucial Sheikhdomo v/e hao. no powers of jurisdiction, even o\ er .diit.ioh saoject^. This situation was unsatisfactory and he thought that the question of obtaining such jurisdiction so as to bring the position in these Sheikhdoms into line on this point ought to be considered in the netxi fuouie. X ^ would, of course/6 =. ^ course, 'be necessary to obtain the approval of the Rulers concerned and this might be a delicate business but perhaps developments in connection with oil and the air route might provide the necessary opening for an approach to the Sheikhs. SIR TRElTCHAaD FOWLE said he thought that it would not be impossible to persuade the Sheikhs to give us the same powers as had been obtained from the Sheikh of Qatar but he thought that the matter would require careful handling. He was inclined to think that one Order in Council could be mac-e to cover all the Trucial Sheikhuoms. MR. BAG-GALLAY agreed and thought that one Order in Council would be sufficient, provided, of course, that the necessary grant of jurisdiction was obtained Irom each of the Rulers to whose territory the Order was to apply. Reverting to the question of the War Emergency Legislation itself, MR. WALTON said that what seemed to be required, when the time came, was a short Or^er in Council on the lines suggested by Sir Trenchard i'owle, with a blanket clause vesting in the Political Resident fairly wide powers to make, in respect of persons suulecj. to His Majesty 's .j urisdiction , such Regulations as may be necessary to provide for the security of British interests etc., in the Arab Sheikhdoms. When the emergency arose it would be necessary to take prompt sueps oo ensure that provisions similar to those in the Order in Council and any Regulations made by the Political Resident applied also to persons who were outside our jurisdiction. This could hardly be done without the consent of the Rulers concerned, but it might be hoped that they would not/A V ^ 6 - ■, not refuse to comply with, our wishes. We were proceeding on the assumption that these Sheikhdoms would be prepared, if desired, to come in on our side in the event of war. The position in Muscat was rather different, since, although we had treaty relations with the Sultan, he was an independent sovereign in treaty relations with other Powers (France and the U.S.A.), and it could not 'be said with certainty that he would come in on our side. By virtue of our existing Treaty we possessed jurisdiction, to the extent laid down in the Muscat Order in Council, over British subjects in Muscat. Therefore any Persian Gulf emergency legislation would automatically apply to such persons. If, however, the emergency was such that it was thought desirable that similar legislation should extend to persons under the Sultan's jurisdiction, we could only do our best when the time came to persuade the Sultan to agree. (Intdl.) A.C.B.3. :A OFFICE. November, 1937.Sir V. ^awson , You may 'oe interested in this, as one of the matters in connection with war emergency legislation. In view of the C.i.D.'s conclusion (k)(iii) ? we took the opportunity of Sir T. Fowls's deputation to this country to discuss the matter with him in a preliminary way. He first recorded the note of 6th October on the file. We sent this to the Foreign Office ana obtained the minute by Mr, Beckett enclosed with their letter of 10th November. As suggested in that minute, we arranged for a preliminary meeting with representatives of the Service departments to obtain their views, and those of Sir T, Fowle, on the question what should be the content of the regulations for the Persian Gulf. The draft minutes of the meeting are attached. I am not sure whether it is necessary to carry the matter any further at this stage. If so, 1 suppose the next step would be to put what is thought to be required into the form of a draft Order in Council covering draft regulations, A further small question oi procedure is whether two draft Orders in Council are required - (1) a draft Order under Clause 4 of the Schuster Bill, and (2) a draft Order for the -Persian Gulf, parallel (mutatis mutandis ) to the Order which is to be made xor this country under Clause I of the Bill; but I suppose that one Order (under Clause 4, but also covering the actual regulations) would be sufficient. (Sgd.) J. G. Walton. 26,11,37.Mr. Walton, Seen and returned with thanks. So far as I can see I should think that a single Order under clause 4 of the Bill ought to suffice. I suppose that, the C.I.I/, having approved in principle the draft Bill ana draft Regulations subject to the results of the further inquiries contemplated inter alia in conclusion (k)(iii), the position is that at some time or other the results of this particular inquiry must go back to the C.I.i^., probably through the Schuster Committee itself. I do not, however, know at what stage that will be appropriate. Meanwhile it might be as well perhaps to have reaay in cold storage a draft of the Oraer proposed, and possibly attachea to it a short inaication of the proposed local Regulations to be made oy the political Resident uncer it.

(ii) A clause providing for the requisition of chattels, —— ships ana aircraft. (iii) A clause making- it an offence to obstruct the exercise of the powers in (ij ana (ii). (iv) A clause authorising the conscription of labour ior the purposes of the Royal Air Force and/or Royal Navy. In regard to (i), if the Sheikhs already own all the land in the Sheikhdoms ana have a hereditary arbitrary power of interference and uisposal, this clause may be totally unnecessary or may be necessary only ior the purpose of reinforcing existing powers. As regarus (iii) it might be possible bo bring tnis clause /the'Hegulations which the Resiaent woula have power to make uiu er the Blanket Clause on the ground that it is a matter of public oruer. Yours sincerely, (Sgu.) H. B. Russell. Symon, Esq., a Office, Whitehall, S.W.I.- Si1 785/38. Legal Adviser , Please see the Bill and draft Regulations in the paper at the 'bottom of the file* v /hich have 'been prepared with a view to the imiriediate enactiuent of war emergency legislation if necessary, and the notes of a conference IsGt November with the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf and representatives of the Service Departments and the Foreign Office to consider what matters should 'be included in the separate Order in Council which, in accordance with clause Ij.(l)(d) of the Bill, would make provision for what is required in the Persian Gulf to the extent of His Majesty*s jurisdiction therein. It is desired to prepare for the War Emergency Oornraittee the draft of an Order in Council covering the ground. Could you kindly advise as to the formphich this should take? As you know, H.M. has jurisdiction which he exercises under the Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and Muscat Orders in Council. (It will 'be desirable to obtain the consent of the Trucial Sheikhs also to the exercise of jurisdiction, but this is a separate matter which will be taken up separately.) What is required is to be prepared Y/ith the draft of an 0» in C. to apply such regulations as would be required incase of an emergency in these territories (to the extent of our existing jurisdiction). One question on wiich I am doubtful is whether this can be done by means of a single draft Order (which would be far simplest), or whether a separate draft Order must be prepared for each of the separate territories. Assuming that a single order would be possible, I presume that/1 0 1-5 that it might he adequate if the draft Order were somewhat in the form of the attached sketch. A further point on which I am doubtful, however, is whether we should go on to provide in the actual draft Order for the particular matters in respect of which it is desired to take powers in the Persian Gulf (as indicated in the minutes of the conference and the subsequent correspondence with the Departments), not all of which are perhaps adequately covered by Sec.l of the Bill. If so, we might perhaps add to the draft Order a clause to the following effect;- Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred Defence Regulations may provide for (a) Declaration of protected areas. ) (b) Making it an offence to loiter in such areas. ) (c) Making sabotage of any kind an offence. 23 (d) Making espionage an offence. 12, 13, ' 1,2 (e) Prohibition of propaganda and any activites prejudicial to public order or security or the efficient proseotion of the war. 37, 38 (f) Authorising compulsory acquisition of land for military and Air Force purposes. 5U, 56. (g) Authorising requisition of chattels, ships and aircraft. 57 (h) Authorising conscription of labour for the purposes of the R.A.P. or R.N. (i) Restriction of entry into the territories. 17, 2. (j) Deportation from the territories of any person whose presence is deemed 3(1), prejudicial to public order or security. 19(2) (k) Taking of any measures necessary for the maintenance of public order and security. (l) Penalties for (b), (c), (d) and (e) and for obstructing exercise of powers under (f) and (g) and generally. 97 Alternatively/3. Alternatively, would it perhaps 'be better to prepare the actual draft of Regulations covering these matters? lii either case, further consultation with the Political Resident will be necessary on the question of the penalties to be provided, which might be different from the penalties proviaed in the draft Regulations for the U.K., because it is proposed that if and when the time comesj the Rulers of the States in the Persian Gulf should be asked to issue proclamations taking power to deal with persons under their own jurisdiction in a manner identical with the provisions in the Regulations which would be made by the Politick Resident in respect of persons and matters under His Majesty's jurisdiction. Sir T. Powle will be in this country again a.t the beginning 01 next month, andw? can take the opportunity to consult with him about this. I could discuss these and connected questions with you at your convenience, and perhaps you would be willing to help us to draft an 0. in C. and (if this course seems best) draft Regulations covering the matters for which it is desired to make particular provision. (Sd) J. G. WALTON, 8.3.38. I think it is probably better to confine the 0. in G. to empowering the Resident to make the Defence Regulations, rather than insert any of them in the O.in G. itself. A Regulation embodied in the 0. in 0. can have no greater scope or validity than provisions expressed in a Regulation made by the authority empowered under Gl.I|.(l) (d). Both must equally be restricted to matters within the scope of the sections of the Act. I have suggested in pencil in the draft certain alterations/k. alternations v/hich seem to do what is required. The Trucial Sheikhs havebeen left in on the assinnption that H. M. will have acquired jurisdiction before this draft O.in 0. is used; if not they must be excluded. 2. As regaros the Pwegulations, it may be possible, and is probably desirable, to have one set which can apply to all the territories, and to the persons over whom H.M. exercises jurisdiction in each case. Complementary to those regulations would be a similar set, if possible in identical terras, which the Sheikhs would promulgate at the same time, covering those persons remaining under their own jurisdiction. This would complete the circle, except in the case of Muscat, where apparently some other Foreign countries also exercise some jurisdiction over their own nationals. 3* In drafting the Regulations it should be possible to proceed on the model of the corresponding ones attached to the draft Bill in the file, but with alterations of course adapted to local conditions. Subject to your views, I doubt if it is wise to start on the drafting until we have Sir T. Fowled assistance for the purpose of the actual choosing and framing of such regulations as are wanted for his purpose. ^4- With reference to the various headings (a) to (l) in your minute I have noted marginally what appears to be the corresponding regulation to work from in the English draft, as near as I can find them. As regards (f) u acquisition' is probably the wrong term to use. All that is wanted is a right to possession, user and control: see CI.1(2)(b)(i) of the draft Bill. (b) I have not found any corresponding English draft Regulation. That is probably because of the words in square brackets in Cl.l(5) of the Bill. If those words are detained, probably such a regulation would be ultra vires . (This/•f*' 'i, to ' 5. (This may 'be one matter in which, the Sheikh 1 s regulations would differ, if he agreed to conscription for his own people). (k) seerns perhaps unnecessary since a regulation can always 'be made at once, within the terms of the Act, to meet any situation tliat apise' or is threatened^ (Sd) H. PEARSON, 10.3.38.WHEREAS 'by treaty, etc., His Majesty has jurisdiction within the territories of the Sheikh of Koweit, the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Sheikh of Qatar, the Trucial Sheikhs (enter names) and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; Now, therefore, His Majesty, by virtue and in exercise of the powers in this behalf 'by Section 4(1) (d) of the Emergency Powers (defence) Act, 19 , or otherwise in His Majesty vested, is pleased by and with the advice of His Privy Council to direct that the first three sections of that Act shall extend to the above-mentioned territories to the extent of His Majesty's jurisiaction therein respectively with the following adaptations and modifications. The political Resident in the Persian Gulf shall be substituted for His Majesty in Council as the authority empowered to make Lefence Regulations zor the saici territories respectively,, To the extent that any such iJefence Regulation may be inconsistent with the provisions ox any existing ur^er _ in Council or of any rules or regulations made thereunder the Defence Regulation shall prevail.1785/38. -t A- j .J it n . ^ ■ 4- Sir V« Dawson , With reference to your note of 26th November last, will you please see the notes below exchanged with the Legal Adviser. I agree with the conclusions in Sir H. Pearson's minute. Sir T. Powle will 'be in London at the end of this month on a short visit, and will be further consulted. We could then send the draft Order in Council to the War Emergency Committee with the neossary explanations. But perhaps it would be better to wait until the draft Regulations, which it will be desirable to have prepared in advance of the emergency; have been actually drafted (as to which we shall have to rely mainly on Sir Fowle, who may not be able to complete the job till after his rsburn to Eushire)? (Sd) J.G. WALTON, 10.3.38. Mr. Walton .

Some of the Sections are based on suggestions I made at the India Office, and others - very useful ones vvhich I had not thought of • have been added. My particular comments are as follows. 5# (a) Section 2 (2) of tne draft King's Regulations. As the term of imprisonment in Sections 2 (2) and 8 (2), 3 months, is the same I think the maximum fines should be identical. I suggest therefore that the fine in paragraph 2 (2) be raised to Hs.SOOq/-. (b) Section 2 (3). A term of imprisonment, say 1 month, should be added if the fine is not paid, other wise there is no means of enforcing the fine. The following words should be added after Rs.250/-, ♦•or to imprisonment for one mcrcth in lieu of payment 11 . (c) Section 6. Textual alteration w of security* 1 to b® altered to *or aecurity M .

Under Section 10 of the Regulat ions, however, I assume that the Political Agents can try all offences under i the Regulations and pass sentences up to the limits of the powers they at present possess under the existing Orders in Council* Further tnat this Section gives me as Chief Court the same powers of re vis i on, and on appeal, as I hold now. Could you please let me know if these assumptions are correct ? ( e) There is no Section in the Regulations giving me (and by implication to Political Agents) powers of (1) intercepting and examining telegrams, letters or parcels, or of (2) censorship. With regard to (1). At Muscat and Bahrain there are Government of India post offices and telegraph stations of Cable and tireless Limited, and the i Resident and the political Agents at these posts should certainly have the necessary powers. At JSiwait there is, as you are aware, an Iraqi Post and Telegraph Office, though arrangements are . being made to replace it by a .British of! ice. If however there is still an Iraqi Post Office there on the outbreak of war, the only solution, as far as I can see, is for the Shaikh, in the exercise of his /(2)/ his soTereign power, to delegate to the Political Agent the necessary powers. $ith regard to (2) # It is true that there are no nevrs- papers published at present in the ATab States but one does not ]cnow what developments there may be in the future, and in any case the Political Authorities should have powers to confiscate objectionable news papers entering the States, or the sending of objectionable telegram or articles to the Press. To cover (1) and (2) therefore 1 suggest the insertion at any convenient place in the draft Regudations of the following additional section. (1 have based the wording roughly for (a) on Section 26 (1) of the Indian Post Office Act VI of 1898 and for (b) on Section 5. (l)(b) of the Indian Telegraph Act XIII of 1885). 11 (l) The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may, in the territories of the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, by order in writing (a) direct that any postal article or class or description of postal articles in course of transmission by post shall be intercepted or detained or shall otherwise be disposed of ( b) direct that any message or class of messages to or from any person or class of persons or relating to any particular subject brought for transmission by, or transmitted or received by, any telegraph, shall not be transmitted, or shall be intercepted or detained, or shall be disclosed to any person mentioned in the order.''V [2) The political Resident May, by order in writing, delegate his powers under this Section to the Political Agents at Bahrain and Muscat for exercise within the limits of the Bahrain and kuscat Orders in Council respect ivaly, (3) Any person who fails to comply with an order in writing under this Section qhall be liable to a fine not exceeding Ro.iQOO/-, or to imprisonment for two months in lieu of payment,* (f) (l). Sections 3 and 4. Sabotage and Espionage. At the India Office I had suggested tnat the maximum punishment for these two offences should be ieath and that this should be within the powers of the Resident, the customary punishment in time or war, certainly for espionage and 1 think for sabotage, is death, and as under the Regula tions we are laying down punishments for various war-t i;ae offences, it seems tome illogical not to have the appropriate punishment for two of the moat serious of them. The position in peace time in regaxd to the sentences of death is that if they are passed by the Political Resident in the exercise of his original jurisdiction as Chief Sourt they need no confirmation under Section 31 of the code of Criminal Procedure. If such sentences are passed by political Agents in their capacity of Sessions Judge, then confirmation of the sentence by the Governor-General in Council is required under Sections 16, 15 and 15 of the Kuwait /Kuwait, Bahrain arid Muscat Ureters in Council respectively. I must therefore return to the cnarge and aaic that offences under Sections 3 and 4 of the draft Hegulat ions should be punisnable by deatn» If this sentence is passed by tne Political Resident tnen no confirmation is required, fhe whole aim of tne draft Regulations is to give tne Political Resident increased powers in war time tnan ne would nave in peace, and certainly not to lessen tnerr. If tne sentence is passed by a political Agent then it would, at present, require c onf i met ion by the Oovemor-fieneral in Council. It is nost desirable to prescribe tne death penalty for offences under tne t wo sections in question. Prevention is better than cure and what we want to do in time of w&amp;x is P^QVent tnese two serious offences being commit ted, and a published notice tnat laid down death as a penalty is more likely to have a deterrent effect tUan one whio.i merely prescribes imprisonment. (2) I suggest tnerefore that the penalty clauses of Sections 3 and 4 snould read 'liaole to punishnent witn deatn, or imprisonEuent for a term not exceed ing 14 years, and may be deported'*. There does not appear to be enytning in tna draft legJlations concerning hostile propaganda. This is a very important point, and should certainly be covered* I suggest tne inclusion, tnerefore, at any convenient place in the draft Hegulations of tne following additions *Any /h |(| I M, -6- person influencing public opinion in any wry ^hatsoeTer frej|iiclici?il to tne conduct of tne war, or of order and security, shall be liatle to a penalty of Imprieonm&amp;nt for a tern not exceeding aevan years, and metf De deported. 1 * 4. (!)• With regard tt tiie parallel a lane to Ge issued by tne Rulers, vide last paragraph of your letter. r agree thrt lections 2 - 7 of tn; draft Regulations afford a suitable oasis for these alona* There is no need of course for Jectione 1, 2, 9 and 10 to be included in tne £ 1 ans , c od witn regard to Section 8 I think it would be possible to arran t e #itn ine luler toat, if necessary, cases could oe triea in nis Court in camera. (2). I asi definitely of opinion t oat we ehould approacn tne Rulers now, i»e # in peace tiae, and dra# up confidentially with them a suitable alan to be issued in case of necessity. rhe advantages of this procedore a^e obvious. To wait until war actually breaks out before approacning the Rulers would entail a delay of weeks in discussion wnen it is essential tnat the alans should be brought into force iamediately on tne outbreaic of war. f ?he only disadvantage is on tie ground of secrecy. After the crisis of last Tjeptember and His Majesty^s (fcvemment 1 s open rearmament campaign, however, tnere is no secret tmt we think mx may casae. There would of course be no mention to tne Rulers of tne proposed ^lergeney Powers (Defence) Act; tney would merely be told tnat in case of war the Resident would issue certain local regulations affect ixig persons under hie jurisdic tion and that it was desirable for them to nave a iang ready dealing with persons under their jurisdiction. Whatever may be the necessity for keeping secret in the United Kingdom the text of far Legislation owing to its encroachment on individual 11 teerty/ i ■ r;I ft h ' uv ^ -7- ^ liberty, this ara^ent does not apply to the Arab states, and if tilQ matter is put to tiie Rulers now as su^^estsd above I think they will regard it as quite a noraai precaution. They will doubtleas require some time for reflection and discussion, and for making certain possible modifications to suit local conditions, and tnese discussions shrjuld certainly be under taken before the outbreak of war and not after. 5. In connection generally with /ar Legislation X should like in conclusion to put on record my opinion of the weakness of the Resident's position. At Kuwait all Moslem foreigners are under the juris diction of the Shaikh i.e. Iraqis, Hejdis, Persians, Syrians, etc. It is these individuals yiio are most likely to give trouble as agents, saboteurs, propagandists etc., and to deal with them, as with Kuwait subjects, the Resident will have to depend on tne Shaikh vigorously applying his alan . At Bahrain the position is stronger as all foreigners fall under the jurisdiction of the Resident. Owing to the recent Bahrain Nationality Law, however, a number of Persians will acquire Bahrain nationality. ?o deal with these individuals as well as with Bahrain subj ects, again the Ties ident will have to depend on the Shaikh 1 s co-operation in enforcing the alan . On the Trucial 2oast tne position is weak in the extreme as we have no Order in Council for that area. All foreigners therefore, as well, of course, as subjects of the Shaikhs, fall under the Ohaikn's jurisdiction. Suppose therefore that an enemy agent, following the example of fassmuss in Persia during the last Jar, proceeded to operate In one of the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms, legally the Resident could /i *&gt;7 -a- could take no action but would have to depend on the local Shaikti to deal with him. The only solution to better the position on the Trucial Coast, though even this would not make it entirely satisfactory, would toe to endeavour to arrange now with the Shaikhs of that area for the publication on the outbreak of war of alans sijailar to those of the other Arab Stat es. fits-' , ^3 '-V pit //a- ^ 1 |X 4 With regard to British subjects on the Trucjlal Coast,' o fl&amp;i* '4 ft fc j'^t IwfxU ^ P-\ ; ~ , foreign department, Not if i'c^t ion Under Government of India 150.2402 J!.?., date&lt;l the 6th October 1^81, the Political Resident and his surst Assistant (Secretary) exercise certain criminal powers over British Indian subjecto. At Muscat all foreigners other than British subjects fall under the Jurisdiction of the Sultan. The position is therefore weaker than tnat at Kuwait. 6. It will be seen therefore that for war-t ime require ments the legal powers of the Resident all along the Arab Coast, though somewhat stronger in certain States than in others, wojld be far frotn effective. To ranedy this I nad suggested the application in war-time of a 'blanket H Order in Council giving the Resident jurisdiction over all inhabitants, of any nationality whatsoever, of all the Arab States of the Persian Gulf (vide paragraph 15 of my $ote dated the 6th October 1937). This ho/ever the Foreign Office were unable &lt;2- / on legal grounds to accept - vide paragraph JLO of Beckett*s Hote enclosed with Foreign Office letter l^o.E. 6567/G, dated the 10th Kovember 1937, to the India Off ice. I am quite ready of course to accept these grounds, but at the sa^ae time i /9 I ahould be glad if the poaition C)old be explained to the Service Departments who may be moat affected by t-ie .veaknesa of the Residents position. It is impoaaible to say now far the Arab side of the Gulf may become the object of war- time activities of an enemy, but if these activities bee ass at all intense the service departments may well require from the Resident preventive action which he nay be unable to take. * I am sending a copy of tnis letter to Metcalfe * sent under Printed letter No.607-3 of the 13th Hovember 1958.I I 379/44 Telegram S Fro® Political Reaident, Bushire.

On the 28th October, under cov?r oi. 1 India Ofrice letter No.P.Z.7100/38, we sent to you and ^ b~- ? to Beckett a copy of our letter to Powle of the 28th Qctober dealing with war emergency legislation in the Gulf and enclosing provisional drafts of an Order in Council and of Defence Regulations to 'be made thereunder. ^ t - /&gt;o Fowle's views have now 'been received in his letter of the 18th November ? of which I enclose a copy. v7e are asking the Government of India if they have any comments to make i 'but we should be grateful if the subject could be considered again urgently by the Foreign Office in the light of Powle's letter. 2. With regard to his paragraph 3 3 our provisional views are as follows (a) and (b), We agree generally, but we think it would be logical to introduce generally throughout the Defence Regulations what seems to be a customary equation/ -GS, jjj SQ . , Lgn Office, U/.l.equation 01 ono mon'th.'s irnprisoriineri't with a. fine of Rs.500. Consequently we would propose the following amendments of ohu- clrQ,f t icegulat ions prepared in 0cto'ber last: Regulation 2(8). Substitute Rs.l ? 500 for Rs.500. Regulation 2(3), Substitute Rs.500 for Rs,250 and add ''or to imprisonment for one month on failure of payment H . Regulation 8(2). Substitute Rs.1,500 for Rs.3 y 000. (d) Pov/le' s assumptions appear to us to be correct. We should be glad if you could confirm them. (e) The new Regulation proposed by Powle seems appropriate. It might be inserted after no.7 in the existing draft. (f) As regards the death penalty we felt here that it would hardly be appropriate for the emergency legislation for the Gulf to provide for capital •punishment when the maximum penalty provided under the proposed United Kingdom legislation? viz. in the case of sabotage 5 was only 14 years' imprisonment. We think that Fowle may be under some misapprehension here. Broadly speaking the United Kingdom emergency legislation, as we understand it, is designed to create new/o • new offences snci pi'ovicie pen.a .-l 'ties 't/lier'efor 1 ^ and. so to supplement ? 'out not replace, the permanent law of the land. This is obviously the case, for example, with regard to espionage ? and we would imagine that Powle already has all the powers he needs and desires loy virtue e.g. of section 181 of the Indian Penal Code. We should 'be glad to know if Beckett confirms this view. If however it should he thought that there is no objection to admitting Fowle's proposal that the maximum penalty for breaches of Regulations 3 and 4 should 'be death ? there is one argument in its favour which he does not mention, namely that the Rulers are to 'be invited to enforce similar regulations and that it is important that the maximum deterrent should be applied to the persons under their jurisdiction, (g) Powle has overlooked that hostile propaganda is already covered by Regulation 5. 3. With regard to his paragraph 4(2) we think he makes a good case for approaching the Rulers now instead of ' • - • • - • - a ting until the emergency is imminent or has actually urred. 4. We have consulted Powle in the matter of the Trading , &lt;&gt;«« 'b. t'O h the Snerny Bill and are waiting to learn what exceptions, ptations and modifications are required in the application of/ i f» &gt; ~y 4. ' 7 : .X sju.. &amp; f the provisions contained in the Bill asd the Gulf States. 5, Beckett agreed last Octohtr that no modification or Captation of the Ships and Aircraft (Transfer Restriction) ill is required for the purpose of its application in the alf. Since it is intended that this i.ct should extend to 11 territories in which His Majesty has jurisdiction we ssume that all we require to do in this case is to hring cie provisions of the draft Bill ? and eventually of the Act ? o the notice of the Political Resident and the Political gents concerned. 6. We should he very grateful if we could have the lews of the Foreign Office as early as possible ? and to acilitate matters I am sending a copy of this letter and nclosure direct to Beckett, Yours sincerelyjfi~3 S9. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 1st Pebruar-'-, 1939. 7o. Dear Peel, A.//Q ' In reply to your letter of January 26th (P.Z.474/39) , regarding war emergency legislation in the Persian Gulf, i cannot, I think, do better than quote Beckett^s minute • on the points you raise. '♦I will deal first with paragraph 3(d) of the / V ' ' p-ICrO Political Agent's letter. The assumptions in sentences 3, 4 and 5 are correct, subject of course to this, that the sentences for offences under the regulations cannot exceed the maximum laid down in the regulations. In the first two sentences of this paragraph Sir T. Powle says 'j^t first sight it did not appear to me that the Resident under the Regulations had the authority on delegate his powers to the Political Agents. It is of course essential that the latter, who are the Political Authorities on the spot, should be in a position to put the Regulations into force.' As these sentences are rather ambiguous, it will be better to take the matter by steps. In the first pi-ice, the draft Order in Council says that the regulations are to be made by the Political Resident and it is Quite clear that as the Order in Council now stands only the Political Resident, including somebody temporarily holding that office, can make regulations and the power to make them cannot be delegated to the Political Agent. If this is what is meant by 'put the regulations into force 0 , the answer is there is no delegation. 'The next point is that the regulations themselves re f e r/ el, Esq., M.C. , a Office, •W.l.!%S4 * • V J*lf\ 2. refer in one or two places to orders by the Political Resident, viz. regulation 2(1) and regulation 7, and it is quite clear I think under the regulations as drafted that these orders can only he made by the Political Resident and that if we want to provide that the power to make these orders can be delegated in the case of each State to the Political Agent this must be stated in the regulations itself. Apart from these points it is quite true that the Political Agent in each State can enforce the regulations and the orders made by the Political Re s i dent unde r them. 'Paragraoh 2(f), I agree with the objections to introducing the death penalty in these regulations stated in the India Office letter. I also agree that these regulations create new offences and provide penalties therefor to sup element and not replace the existing law. The death penalty exists in England for treason. This is also the case apparently under the law of India, viz. Section 121 of the Indian Penal Code, and this section continues to apjly under the Orders in Council. It is not the case I think that either espionage or sabotage is punishable with death in war time or otherwise in the ordinary courts and it is not apparently proposed to make these offences punishable with death in this country in the case of war. The position may be different as regard spies and saboteurs caught in the area of operations who are dealt with by the military authorities, but that has no relevance here, thou^i it may be what is in Sir T. Powle's mind. It is quite clear therefore I think that it would be improper to institute the death penalty for these offences In fee Persian Gulf and I feel obliged to ad ! that even if it had heen the case/mm.- case that the death penalty was proposed in the regulations applicable to this country I should have had very grave hesitation in advising that it should be incorporated in the regulations for the Persian Gulf. The imposition of a death penalty by courts which are not staffed with trained judges and where the defence cannot be represented by efiicient advocates is not to be approved lightly, and this reluctance is not lessened when it is contemplated for what may be called political offences in time of war when prejudice rims very strong: long sentences of imprisonment or for transportation can be reduced if later it is found that the evidence was not so convincing as it appears to the court, but the death sentence is irrevocable. 'With regard to paragraph 4(2) of the Political Residents letter, I agree with him and the India Office subject to anything the Co-ordination Section have to say. 'I agree with paragraph 5 of the India Office letter as regards the Ships and Aircraft Transfer Restriction Bill. ,, Prom the political point of view we are in entire agreement with his comments; and our Co-ordination Section (who deal with war legislation generally) agree as to an immediate approach to the Rulers, Yours sincerely, V (Sgd.)

I enclose copy of . ^ -r (a) Draft Persian Gulf States (ISmergency) Order in Council, and L . _ . p ' I H (b) Draft Defence Regulations under (a). The general idea is that on the outbreak of war and for its - Nation the Resident and the Political Agents under him must be iv en special legislative powers. That these powers should be embodied n ^ draft Order in Council and draft regulations to be kept in readi es for application on the outbreak of war. The draft legislation 0 Question is embodied in (a) and (b), which are the result of long ^aiderat ion by His Majesty's Government and myself. ^ctual ^ conditions may reveal points which have not been covered in these ^8.Article 2 # however, of the draft Order in eouncil gives the Se. /a?/ - miv —785 S ap —(M-ioi4)-18-8 33—2ooooo. / Politicalpolitical Resident full powers to make and amend Regulations and by the exercise of these powers the Resident can fill up such gaps as may come to light. 3. (a) and (b) can of course only apply to persons under our jurisdiction, I had suggested to His Majesty^ Govern ment that the Political Resident should be given special powers over all inhabitants of the Arab States but there were legal difficulties in the way of adopting this sugges- t ion. 4. ?e shall therefore have to depend on the Rulers for applying war legislation to the persons under their jurisdiction, and the best way to do this .vould be for them to issue Mans when a^d if war breaks out. Such Alans would correspond to Articles 2 to 7 of the Defence Regulations and paragraph 2 of the Notice thereto. 5. it is obvious that before drawing up these Alans the Rulers will require some time for consideration, and it is equally obvious, as I pointed out to His Majesty's Govern ment, that such consideration should take place now and not on the outbreak of war. His Majesty's Government have agreed and the scheme is for Political Agents to approacL ■Rulers verbally on the following lines. \hat in trie event of war the Resident would issue certain local regulations affecting persons under his jurisdiction and that it would be essential for the Rulers to issue corresponding Alans to deal with persons under their jurisdiction. mat it was desirable for the Rulers to have the actual text of such Alans drawn up confidentially beforehand, so that in an / emergency-3- emergency they could be published imined lately. In the mean time of course such Alan s would be kept strictly confidential. some of the provisions of the draft Alan amongst which will be the death penalty corresponding to paragraph 2 of the Notice. If they take up this attitude it should be explained to them that as a deterren t it is essential that publicity should be given to the death penalty, and that whether this is actually carried out will depend on the Ruler is discretion. It can further be emphasised to them that all the provisions of the Alan would apply only for the duration of the war. 7. I hope to be able to send you a draft Alan by this mail, if there is time to catch it, or by next mail. In the meantime you need take no action. 8. Some points of (a&gt; and ( b) are still under considera tion but these do not affect the Articles of the Defence Regulations on which the Alan s will be based. 9. for the Trucial Coast we have no Order in Council and so no war legislation will be applicable there* 10. The Trading with the Enemy Regulations (Article 3 (2) of the draft Order in Council) are unaer consideration ana a further communication on this point will be made in due 6.

As regards British subjects and non-ioslem foreigners Political Agent, Bahrain, after consultation with theKeaidency 3har j ah, is of opinion that if «• approach the rrucial mmi*m for cession of jurisdiction over these cl&amp;aaes (1) the Shaikhs will not believe our object to r:e solely war legislation, (2) they may demand a guidj^rQ_£UO&gt; ^ /u,, nhohi inarlaii and has al Kiiaiman (3) the Shaikm of Msu Dhat&gt;i, ^naija are lively to refuse to cede the jurisdiction eought, (4) the reiaalnlng Shaikhs of the truclal coast, wno may be expected to cede jurisdiction over British objects i „„ .»h«=n tiey find t/iat tiie and non -'loalem foreigners, arnen &lt;.&gt;&lt;v Shaikhs mentioned in (3) above nad sto-Jd out, ^ould feel that they tneaseivea nad been tricKed, (5) the result of any approach would probably be to destroy / theWJy the present impreuaion of our juriodiction mentioned in paragrapn 5 above and thus leave via in a «orse position than at present. I concur. 7. The object of obtaintnei Jurisdiction over Britlan subjects and foreigners on the Truoial ^oaat is principally to deal *ith hostile enemy agents in time of '.Tar. 'heae fall under the follow. ing categories. (a) Non-&gt;loalera nationals of enem^' '.itatea. (b) Hon-xAoalem traitorous s jbj ects of tne iritian ^apire or allied Itatea. (c) Non-Moslem subjects of aeutral states. (d) Uoalma of wiiataoever nationality.

(c) can be detained for a considerable time before being enaoled to return to their own country. In such c ircumsvancea it may be expected that the neutral country concerned would disown the Individual, or at . ^ ^h im b^nnlf. in which case any r^te not intervene on nia no awicward questions would arise.

In view of tne ImpossloiHty of obtaining It (paragraph 6 above), It Is not proposed / to— 4- ^ f. to seeK Jurisdiction, ?e would nave to rely on the 3haikhe by pecuniary inducenents to deal with tnem. 8, Paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference. even witnout surrender of juriadiction it would be yoasible to aak tne iinaiKhs to prepare alana making certain activities in tiieir ;&gt;tate punien- able in war time, political \gent, Bahrain, however, feels very uncertain whether the Shaikhs would understand and agree to this proposal since on the ?ruci&amp;l Coast, unlike at JMirain, uiiey aJ e not accustomed to iaaua tueae for their own purposes, political ^ent suggests that it no Sid oe sufficient for us to nave letters ready for ia aue to the .'Shaikhs in case of need i nf omin^ t a em.

In so far aa the control of prices of standard food stuffs in peace time is concerned see my demi-official letter / No. 492-% dated the 12th May 1939, / 5. In so far as the control of prices in war time is concerned, provided that the Bahrain! merchants can get adequate supplies, the same argument applies as given in my letter quoted alcove, i.e. tnat purchasers will naturally seek the cheapest sellers. 4. Supplies however may not be adequate either (a) on account of restrictions in exporting countries (b) on account of excessive re-export from Bahrain to the mainland. 5. (a) we could not control. (b) could be controlled by the Bahrain Government and ourselves imposing restrictions on export.

I inoroaucea the subject on the U..a of parsgraph s'Ji fJ*Bxpr.,. K«. C/323-S d.t.d tt. 8th April 1939 and the draft Alan was read over to him in Arabic. :Ihe Shaikh and his son Hamad were intensely suspicious and t&gt;eg«mhy king that they could not understand the terms of that Alan'. On these being explained in simple language they then said that it would be impossible for them to deal with foreigners on the lines suggested. I reminded them that I had just told them that I would deal with non- Eoslem foreigners and that they would not be involved except possioly In aiding to seize the persons of such foreigners. They then saxd that they could not possibly implement such an Alan without consider- xvm'tish Government. Conditions in Qatar able assistance from the Bri ^ ^ . -in Bahrain and Kuwait and they would need were different from those m danra i .a •. &lt;-&gt; -v* o, ri ' cj. c u.jlj. -l cj- cxj- u j-j-vwa. - ''7': t reminded them that they had a guarantee protection and aid from us# of/- U s. 44, MFP— 985 S&amp;P—(M-1597)—27-11-36—10,000.3/- f VH) i of protection against external aggression and that much assistance had been and was being given to them in other ways, e.g. in obtaining rifles, probably in obtaining light lorries with machine guns mounted., 3nd so on. Their next objection was that the publication of the threat of death sentences would rouse the population against them. I said that it would probably never come to a matter of a death sentence, but they persisted that the very suggestion would cause half the country to rise. After further long argument I repeated that I was merely asking them to agree to an Alan which would assist them in dealing with their own sub jects who might indulge in hostilities against the British Government and the Shaikh of Qatar; they appeared to be trying to make me believe that they were incapable of managing their internal affairs and their repeated statements that they would require so much aid from us made me wonder if they were about to request me to take over their country, ihis produced a better attitude, and the shaikh said that I mi^ht rest assured that he would do all in his power to co-operate with us in war and to prevent any of his subjects acting in a hostile manner towards us. Nevertheless he held that an Alan on these lines was dangerous and he thought we should leave it to him to carry out his promise in whatever way was best from the Arab point of view. Ke might have to kill some people, he might have to bribe others, and some he might have to kiss on the nose I He requested me to send him a fresh translation of the Alan, since he said the version read over to him was in very 'Persianised' form and he would + 4 o-far»tnrv reply. I thought it best to then send me a satisfactory repiy. undertake to give him a fresh translation and this will be sent in the course of the next day or two.I th ink it is probable that the Shaikh of Qatar will will send some reply indicating his readiness to co-operate by such means as he may possess. In that event I would re- commend thao \.e should not press him on the question of the nlan anc content ourselves with such an undertaking. 4.

Hickinbotham, O.B.E., held at the Agency 1/Luscat on May the 13th 1939. His Highness the Sultan called at the Agency this morning and discussed his position in the event of hostilities occurin^and the publication of the ^Alan**. 1 promised that 1 would inform the Hobble the Political Resident of the views he expressed during the interview. 2, The Sultan started by saying that he had already discussed the question with the Hobble the Political Resident on his last visit to Muscat. He then proceeded to state his view of his position. He considered that the issue by him of the 'Alan* would mean that he had renounced his neutrality and had in effect become an ally of Great Britain against a common enemy• This renouncement of his neutrality might, and probably would, result in he and his people becoming subject to risks affecting life and property which they would not have been subject to had the State remained neutral* That it was his duty to his people to ensure that such protection as was possible in the circumstances was forthcoming and therefore he must ask for protection before agreeing to take an action which wi 'Id rightly be construed as terminating his neutrality. He made it clear that this protection must be of two kinds. Firstly,protection from external aggression whether against actual naval or air bases Deir.e used bj His Majesty's GoTernment or against local centres which might be subjected to enemy action either by reason of their military importance or in retaliation for the assistance he / was givingwfcft girlng t© His Majesty's GoTernisent^ Secondly protection against internal disturbances. He considered this second requirement essential as his country vas by no means a cirilised o&amp;e and the excuse that he was inTolTing his country in a uar at the request of His Hajesty* s Government might be used by disaffected persons to foment trouble in the interior of Oman. He stated that the more ignorant of his subjects would not understand the reasons for involving the country in a war which did not appear to directly affect them* His Highness the Sultan then passed on to the question of his position after hostilities had ceased. He seemed to think that h« might find himself attacked or liable to attack for the part he had played during the war. He had no desire to find himself without the support of His Majesty's Government during the unsettled period which experience had shown followed the termination of a major war. He would therefore require an undertaking of protection eren after hostilities had ceased. In his opinion there would still he the possibility of internal unrest and the under taking should therefore relate to moTements directed againet his authority from both external and internal sources. H stated that he was not asking for his territories to be formed into a British Protectorate but rather for protection. His Highness the Sultan added that in the event His Uajesty* s Government being unwilling to safeguard his interests he might consider it desirable in the interests of his Etate to take such other action as might be possible to .. ^ of his country* ensure the weifs^ ^ o,titan then passed on to the A His Highness the Sultan w * actualactttal ^ ****** ▼arious minor objection® to ladlTldoal clauses and the preamble such as disliking the words 'under the Jurisdiction of the Muscat and Oman Government' 1 and preferlng the phrase 'to all people*. In addition to the IndlTldual clauses to which he raised objection he dlsapproTed of the general form of the 'Alan'. He thought that It would look too like foreign dictation If he published an 'Alan' modelled on the Defence Regulations which would have reference to British Subjects and with which It was Intended that his 'Alan' should be slmaltaneously published* His Highness stated that his subjects would resent what might look to them like dictation by a foreign power. Be would prefer in the erent of the necessary guarantees being forthcomings to issue a general 'Alan' Informing his people that a state of war existed between His Majesty's Oovemment and a specific country or countries and that he,in Tiew of his friendship for Great Britain, had decided to glTe all possible assistance to His Majesty^ aoTemment. That any person who In any way assisted the enemy,I.e. the specified country or countries, or acted against the Interests of Great Britain or the State of Muscat and Oman would be sererely punished. He preferred to leare the punishment unspecified as for rellgeous reasons certain punishments might be unsuitable for certain offences. In fact he proposed to inform his subjects of his intention to make use of his unlimited powers in the furtherance of the common object of Great Britain and Muscat and Oman.

I / 2. With regard to Muscat please see paragraph 5 (2) ^ ? &amp; s of my Express Letter ao.4l9-S dated 28th April 1939. ^he Sultan has now been approached by the I ©litleal verballyj and reaction is as follows* (a) His Hifc^ness does not wish to become an ally of His Maj esty* s Government in case of war unless (1) he can be guaranteed protection both external ani internal during hostilities and (2) similar protection for an indefinite period after hostilities had actually ceased. His Bigness- a request under U) for protection froa external attack is understandable. ! t' 11 : iar4 inter 'ill, p*«&lt;- teotion, this is due to his fear of aggression fro. Chian such a. occurred iu the last war (see ***$$ 0f en0l08Ur ' t0 ^ ter / s. 44, MFP—l013S&amp;r—(M.1323)—30-10-33-10,000.

(b) ihe Sultan informed the Political Agent that if his request for a guarantee of protection could not 'be granted by His Majesty , e Government ^he might consider it desirable in the interests of his i =&gt;tate to take such other action as might be possible to ensure the welfare of his country.* Ihe Political Agent did not consider it advisable to question him closely on the exact import of his statement, but thinks that the Sultan was probably referring to the possibility of remaining neutral, and not to that of allying himself with our enemies. I concur. I am sure there is no question of the Sultan doing this. . ' A 1 (c) In regard to the draft alan. If the Sultan remaine neutral there is presumably no question of his issuing an alan . if he becomes an ally, the Sultan would prefer to 'issue a general alan \ i informing his people that a state of war existed between His Majesty^ Government and a specific X country or countries and that he, in view of his friendship for Great Britain, had decided to give all possible assistance to Mis Majesty's uovernraent.^ I am of opinion that such an alan is all that we need. 3 . i t is fox His Majesty's Government to decide whether /*&gt; ** * whether they c^n give His Highness the assurances of protection Tsbtch he requires. There is, however, the alternative sug^sted in paragraph 5 (2) of ray Express letter aG#4l9-3 of 28th April 19 39, and as the Oultan is in need of laoney it is possible that he ssight accept this. It is probable, however, that the Sultan might not consider sufficient the sum I previously suggested i.e. Ha. 10,000 a month. If he was threatened by the Omanis he would have to spend a good deal of money in bribing them to keep quiet, and also in strengthening his own forctes and posts. 4.

No.P.Z.726/39 9 you will see that the Governnent of India support the Political Resident's view that the death penalty should 'be provided for in draft Regulations 3 and 4. ■7ith regard to Beckett's comments on this point, he will of course be aware that the political officers in the Gulf already possess the power of imposing the death penalty for various offences? and furthermore that while a death sentence imposed by a Political / + gent requires to be confirmed by the Governor ft, ' i ''&lt;• • I - ' - 'Ct . General (cf. Article 16 of the Koweit Order) there is apparently no right of appeal from a death sentence imposed by the Political Resident. We agree, nevertheless, with his view that it would not be suitable to provide for the death penalty in the present Defence Regulations. 3/ ? Esq., Oxfice,3. We have 'been considering, however, whethc r (here is any way of meeting Powle ' s view (of.his teleg^ of 25th January, enclosed with Indie Office letter P.Z.549/39 of the 25th January) that the death penalty should appear in the published notice, and it occurs to us as a possibility chat a paragraph on the following lines might he added to the preamble to the published R' gulati -ns. These Regulations supplement the law already administered by the Political Resident and the Political Agents subordinate to him and do not in any way affect the penalties provided under Section 121 of the Indian Penal Code under which any person who wages war against His Majesty, or attempts to wage such war, or abets the waging of such war' f „ may be punished with death. Do the Poreign Office concur, or can they suggest any better way of meeting Fowle's wishes? 4. Your letter did not refer to the new Regulation pro- ^ L'tirO posed in paragraph 3(e) of Fowle's letter of the 18th November. May we take it that you concur?, x ^ • r 5. With regard to Beckett's comments on the powers of Political Agents, we imagine that all that Powle wishes to ensure is that the Political Agents in each State can enforce the Regulations and the orders made 'by the Political Resident/Resident under them. -/e see no grounds for delegating to Political agents the power to make Defence Regulations?

These Regulations can of course apply only to persons over whom we possess jurisdiction in the territories concerned, and in order that their object . iw nTu-..- v. . . . - way he more effectively secured it is proposed 3nant Colonel W. Porter, simultaneously/ ^mniittee of Imperial Defence, 6, Richmond Terrace, • l• 1 ♦simultaneously to invito the local Rulers to issue proclamations applying to the persons under their jurisdiction such of the Regulations as are relevant (pro'bably Nos. 2 to 7) . The Political Resident urges that in order to avoid dangerous delay v /hen'.an emergency arises he should 'be authorised to 'broach the subject to the Rulers forthwith. There would 'be no mention to the Rulers of the proposed Emergency Powers (Defence) Act' They would merely 'be told that in case of war the Resident would issue certain local regulations affecting persons under his jurisdiction and that it is desirable for them to have ready proclamations dealing with persons under their jurisdiction, The Political Resident adds that the Rulers will doubtless require some time for reflection and discussion and for making certain possiole modifications to suit local conditions, and these discussions should certainly 'be undertaken 'before ana not after the outbreak of war. Both we and the Foreign Office agree with these views and we would propose to instruct the Political Resident to approach the Rulers forthwith in the matter. Before/(lop 3« Before doing so, however, we should lie glcd to he assured that you see no ohjection to the action proposed, and I should, 'be very glad if I could have your viev/s with the least possible delay.
