January 14» 1950 &amp; z/sfejso My dear Sir Rupert, I enclose a copy of ray letter to Woods Ballard dated the 24th November 1949 and a copy of a personal letter to Sunter of Gray Mackenzies in Bahrain for information. Sunter had written to me asking me to do anything I could to help, and Grant when he called here also asked me to help on these lines. I spoke to Woods-Ballard, who had already had a discussion with Grant, and he told me that the Muscat Government are very ready to consider any reasonable proposal including the lightering question, but Gray Mackenzies or the B.I. must make the move and this must be soon and in the shape of clear cut proposals. I gather that Mr. Orr Leas, one of Gray Mackenzies Directors, is also coming here from Bahrain in the Barpeta, and I shall tell him the same: Woods-Ballard will be away. If I am also away meeting you at Sohar I will leave instructions for him to be shown my letter to Sunter. Yours sincerely, His Excellency -LO. WlJLV-f Jf Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I.,^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAINfefSOAT/JL 6 No. 1/8/96/50 British Consulste Muscat January 12, 1950 Thank you for your letter of the 29th December. I have ascertained that the Muscat Government would be inclined to give every consideration toi any concrete proposals from Gray Mackenzie or Mtckinnons Mackenzie regarding the establishment of regular calls by w D M boats : so that if any special consideration such as the handling of ttie landing business is what is required, it is up to Gray Mackenzie’s or Mackinnons to make a firm proposal now. The Sultan will be leaving for Dhofar in the middle of February, and it is very advisable for you to get his blessing to your proposal before then. The Landing Contract at present enjoyed by Hajl Bhacker is terminable at 3 months notice on either side. It seems annually from October to October. Hence this should present no obstacle, if the Muscat Government have a mind to meet your wishes. The point is^t is now up to your people to set the pace and make the proposal, and I am certain that the sooner it is made the better. Directly this is done, would, in my judgement be your time to pay a personal call to push any agreement through on the spot. I enclose two copies of the existing contract which has been running from year to year since 1945. Mr. Sunter, Gray Mackenzie A Co., Ltd., BAHRAIN j^y houseMy house will be free from 26th January to 2nd February, 6th to 12th February and after the 16th February. You are most welcome at any time as you know.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000042_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/291</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000042</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/291</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/96 Landing Contract'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1950/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-04-20T23:13:37</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (6 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 8; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file relates to cargo handling at Muscat.
