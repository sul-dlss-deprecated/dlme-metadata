I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India copies of certain old correspondence which has recently come to my notice, referring to a proposal by a British firm in 1857 to engage fn the pearl fishery in these waters. 2. It would appear from this correspondence that the attitude of Government in regard to this question was clearly defined as early as 1857, and as no special reference to this correspondence is made in Government of India despatch No. 63 of loth March 1904 to the Secretary of State on the subject of the Persian Gulf pearl fisheries, it seems worth while submitting copies of the papers in case they are not already on the record of the Foreign Department.

With reference to the subject of your latter No. 2003, and its enclosure, I have the honour to state for the information of the Right Honourable His Lord- ship in Council that I do not conceive British subjects have any right to fish for pearls on the fishing grounds of the Maritime tribes in the Persian Gulf. 2. By sufferance they might indeed be permitted to do so. It would how ever I think necessitate stipulations and agreements between parties, which on the Arab part, would be broken at all times, unless indeed the British Govern ment is prepared to maintain a permanent force on the fishing grounds in the event of the project being carried out on an extended scale. I am of opinion too that British capitalists would not be able to compete with the Banyans and other native traders now monopolizing the fisheries in their own hands, and it is certain that plunder, if not blood shed, would result to inexperienced parties at the outset of operations in this sea. We have examples of the contentions on coasts inhabited by civilized people in regard to fisheries, and I need hardly point out that, if pursued amongst tribes always at feud with each other, grave difficulties must arise which may call for our armed interference at all times. 3. Should however any enterprizing European be desirous of experimenting upon the profits or otherwise, of this trade, I shall be ready to afford him everv assistance in my power, though I would hardly recommend him to embark upon so precarious a speculation. r C 91 FD~ 44 - 8 . 3 - 13 -GCBP Simla No. 3178, dated Bombay Castle, the 8th July 1857.

If Mr. Brett’s report has any foundation, I have the honour to request that you will take an early opportunity to speak to His Highness the Sultan on the subject; remind him of the experiences of the late Ruttonsi Purshotam in the direction under reference and explain to him that in my opinion he will be doing a very bad turn to the Arab pearling communities of the Gulf by taking any action calculated to encourage the introduction of modern diving apparatus into the pearl fisheries. You might add that in the interests of those same com- munities the Government of India have never failed to discourage British subjects from activity in this direction and I trust that he will bear this in mind and be guided accordingly. Please inform me of the result of your communication to His Highness. “THE NEAR EAST.” August jo, IQ12. Minerals in Arabia. United States Consul Homer Brett, of Muscat, Sultanate of Oman, reports that an Indian business man recently completed an extended prospecting tour of Oman at the instance of the Sultan. Only surface work was attempted and it was found impracticable to visit the coal beds which are said to exist in the Shar- keyah district, but it is reported that a valuable chrome deposit, containing small percentages of lead and silver, was found about four miles from Sib, and that development work will soon be undertaken. Tentative plans involve building a 30- mile tramway from Matrah to Sib. The prospector also states that he discovered a mountain of pure crystals of carbonate of lime, but there is no present intention of attempting to utilise this.

In accordance with my instructions, my Dragoman invited His Highness’ attention to the newspaper article and asked if there was any truth in the report. * i'Iis Highness immediately informed him that there was no truth in it whatever. 3. I also took the opportunity of asking Mr. Brett, who said that he heard of the project, among many others, from Mr. Bayanker some months back, but that, since then, nothing further had been heard of the matter.^ Mr. Bayanker is a great talker and is apt to speak of many wild projects which he has started as if they were actually in course of execution. 4.

To The Secretary, Political Department, Secretariat Bombay. Sir, I beg to lay before yon the follonring representation with the hope that it will meet with your kind consideration. As we know the Persian Gulf ani the Oman Seas are open to all for p«Ml fishing, I hare sent to my friend Mr. Abdul Ifefcsin liahari at I-innah on the 10th April from here 8 divers, 2 linesmen, 2 pipemen and a cook with some divers* apparatus such as are used by divers in Aujtr ilia .nd E^ngvon and other parts. These men have given us a written agreement that they worKi do the work of diving etc., on our account. On the 25th inst&amp;at X reeaiTad a letter trm MisLari mjing tnat lie had made all preparations for starting work, but in the meanwhile His Male sty's British Consul at Lingah sent for Mr. Abdul Mohsla Mishari and told him that be would not be alloTfed te fiah for pearls saying that the rulers of the Oman «b 4 Pwrtiaa ^ulf Seas dii not girn permiasion to do so. There upon Mr. Mishari requested the British Oonsul to permit him to fish at Bahrain or Fatar to which the Oonsul was pleased to say tnat there w©« much rink to life in these places at the hands of the native# inhabitants who would attack and kill our Indian -iabjects. Mr. Abdul Mohsin Mishari then said to His Majesty's British Oonsul that he did not think that the Governors of the Omen and the Persian Gulf Seas would raise any objection to our fishing in these seas and he did noc know whether the British Consul had instructions s to prohibit our fishing. He therefore requested the Consul to write to him officially in the matter. The British ConsulConsul declined to give any reply saying that he would only give a verbal reply aid added that if he went for pearl fishing in those seas and if anything went wrong both he and the gentleman that sent him the divers* apoaratus would be held responsible. Under the circumstances I beg to place the matter in your hands and to request you to give necessary instructions to the British Consul at Lingah to allow Mr. Abdul Mohsin to start the work of pearl fishing. In case we are not to be given permission to fish for pearls, I beg you will be kind i enough to let us know so that I may call the men back. We have already incurred heavy expenses upfco now. We went in for all these expenses as we know that the Persian Sulf seas were quite open to all for pearl fishing. If we had known that we would not be allowed to fish we would neve(have sent aiy men at such a great expense. I therefore, once more, beg you would be pleased to take necessary action in the matter, I have, etc., 54/- Mahamed Bin Abdoolwahab Mishari.CONFIDENTIAL. ^ '&lt; _ ~ f c | o i No. 1037, dat ed Bushire, the 26th May (received 4th June) 1912.

I have the honour to invite a reference to mv Diary No. 18, entry 388, for the week ending 6 th May 1912, regarding the importation of diving apparatus and divers from Bombay for use in these waters. 2. The two air-pumping machines and three diving dresses which arrived on the 21 st April 1912 by the Arab Steamship Company’s S. S. “Bahrein” were shipped by Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab, Director of the Arab Steamship Company, to his uncle Abdul Mohsin Mashari, a Bahrein subject residing at Lingah, who is the local manager of the enterprise. The seven divers, lines-men, and pipe-men, who accompanied the diving machines, were engaged by Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab in the Arab Steamship Company’s Office in Bombay. 3. Many rumours have lately reached me that all pearling Nakhudas were combining to prevent the use of these new machines and were prepared to use force. On the 17th May I received a visit from Hamad bin Khalifan Busti, the recognised head of Debai pearling Nakhodas, who made a formal protest before me against the introduction of these machines. Busti stated that all pearlers were determined to prevent their use and that he disclaimed all responsibility if anything happened to the people engaged in this enterprise. He further stated that the Trucial Shaikhs were forwarding a petition to the Resident about it. 4. The same day (17th May) I heard that Abdul Mohsin intended to leave the same evening for the pearl banks with the imported divers, who are all British subjects, and who have been registered in this Vice-Consulate. 1 considered it my duty to inform the divers of the risks involved, which was done, an t e Y were finally warned that if they choose to accompany Abdul Mohsin s expedition, the British Government would not be responsible if any harm came to em. After conferring among themselves all the seven divers decided to ask Abdul Mohsin to send them back to Bombay. I understand Abdul ( V sin 13 re po r in g the matter to Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab and will wait or is rep y e ore sending the divers back to Bombay.Minute Paper. Secret Department.

You have doubtless keen expecting to hear from us with reference to your letter Do* 1269, dated 19th ilay 1911, regarding the local expert examination of the Persian Gulf pearl hanks. We only received on 2nd Cotoher a reply (Do. 2861, dated 21st September) from the Government of Madras, to our letter of the 13th June, a copy of the latter letter is being sent to you officially today. Financial difficulties have arisen and as there is no likelihood of our getting the case through the India Office for some little time to come, we have told the Madras Government that Mr, Hornel^s services will not be required before February at any rate* On a very rough estimate, the cost of Hornell f s deputation will be not less than Bs. 2,0,000* In this I have calculated that the n Pat rick Stewart” would be wanted for about 22 days, and that- that the coat would be Hs. 600 a day* it iLay be r.ore, and there is sure to be some unforeseen expenditure. Before we approach the Secretary of State formally, a definite estimate of the expenditure is required and after reading Hornell's letter of the 11th July, perhaps you could help us, more particularly with regard to the special vessel. Bo you think that the 1T ?atrick Stewart” will be available for 22 days, and do you think assuming that we can get the case through by February next, that the time would be suitable for Hornell to commence proceed ings then ? I fancy February is stormy, and work might be difficult, but it is desirable to get the job through during the off season. Hornell himself would prefer doing the work during the fishing season. There are one or tw r o other points for considera tion. Would the Arab Coast Chiefs he in a position to pay any part of the cost of Hornell's deputation ? is there no likelihood that the result of Hornell's investigations would lead to further expenditure, e,g., in the shape of establishing oyster farms or hatcheries or in other ways ? Is the steamer like to be wanted for more than 3 weeks ? Is the 'Patrick Stewart' provided with a dredge and pump driver and other paraphernalia, such as Hornell considers necessarynecessary ? How would you propose ro proceed about; tlie plotting upon a large scale chart of the positions occupied hy the diving fleets, during the present season ? ^ould it involve any sx expenditure ? I an to ask you to give the matter your further consideration, and perhaps you can introduce, in replying officially with reference to the endorsement goingto you today, answers on the various points raised in this demi- official letter. We cannot get on with the case until we can furnish a complete estimate, and feel assured that e we shall not be committed to considerable further expenditur as the result of hr. Hornell's proposed investigations.Calcutta, January 23rd, 1912 Mj dear Clarke, please see youydemi-official letter of 28th October on the subject of the proposed deputation of an expert to the pearl Banks® It reached Bushire while I was absent at Muscat and I was not able to obtain material for a reply before leaving for Delhi® I have since been in correspondence with hr. Barker, Director Persian Culf telegraphs and I have his authority for placing the following oeiore you iniomsJ.ly» subject to formal confim at ion. Mr. Barker will be leaving Karachi on or about 1st March in the 'Patrick Stewart' for the Persian Gulf on tfes- usual spring tour of Telegraph inspection. He is good enough to express his readiness to take our expert with him and to dovetail his own work in with Mr. Cornell's. He would wish to he hack in Karachi by the 15th April at earliest and 1st May at latest. He will stay aAhoie at several points in the Gulf and where it is r-.erely a natter of transporting hin from one port to another I can assist with the 'Lawrence', so as to leave the 'Jatnck Stewaft' more free for 1 r. KOrnell's work. DuringDaring the 6 weeks or 2 r, onths which hr. Barker is prepared to spend in the G-ulf, Mr. Eornell should find no difficulty in getting the nuinher of days on the pearl hanks that he may find necessary, whether it he 10, 15, or 20 . Mr. Barker informs me, subject to formal confirmation, that he would not consider it necessary to make any charge to Government for the passage of the 'Patrick Stewart' to and from the Gulf. He would merely x charge Government the cost of coal stores etc.expended in connection with Hr. Hornell’s investigations, in excess of what would have been spent had the latter not been there; and the cost of the vessel's services for each dayj&lt; her enploynent on Mr. Hornell's work alone would not he core than 400 /- rupees per day. so that he could spewt 15 days on the banks for 6000/- rupees. As regards weather. March and April wil^ be b v no r-eans an unsatisfactory ti K e for the work - not too hot, and a fair proportion of flat weather. The Arab Coast Chiefs would not be in a position to contribute to the cost of the expert's deputation or rather. I do not think it would be advisable to as ***** them to do so But Government need necessarily he involvedizxvoXvsd 121 210 i nsi* Gxp 621 di'bu,ro* T3i6 ©xp ©irij * s exarination will show us what the position .and prospects of* the fishery are* Xf he reconnen&amp;s fanrs or hatcheries then we should have to consider the political feasibility of carrying out his proposals and the nature of the advice or demands for practical or financial co-operation to be tendered to the Shaikhs interested,. The tT Pratick Stewart” carries all necessary gear for shoal and deep water dredging and the Officer, Mr. Townsend, who will be in command during the ships next trip, is an expert conchologist and collector. Probably little or no fresh gear would be needed. I recommend however that if the sanction of the project is practically assured Mr. Hornell be directed to place himself in personal communication with Captain Townsend with regard to details of his requirements. It would not be possible to make a special survey of the banks for the present tour, but sufficient information is available in our oliarts, sailing directions and gazetteer to enable a plan of the position and general extent of the banks to be drawn out and I will ask the co-operation and advice of His Excellency air Edmund Slade with a view to -etting tl at doneI trust that the i ore or less informal way of JfBSi carrying out the investigation above outlined, which offers considerable advantages in the direction of economy, will be considered deserving of recommendation to the Secretary of State for sanction by telegraph, I would be inclined merely to say that it was considered that the carried investigation could be naiisi/out for so much, and not go into details, in case the Director in Chief of Telegraphs should want to make heavier charges than Hr. Barker will if left to arrange things with me. Yours sincerely, Sd/- P* 2. Cox, E. H.

From— The Hon’ble Me. A. G. Cardew. C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of No. 2861 , dated Ootacamund, 21 st September 1911 . In reply to your letter No. 1190 E. A. (Confidential), dated the 13 th June last, I am directed to forward herewith a copy of Mr. HornelFs letter dated the Uth July 19 J which contains his views on the suggestions made by Colonel Cox in his letter No. 1269 , dated the 19 th May last regarding the proposed examination of the pearl banks of the Persian Gulf at the beginning of the coining cold weather. 2 . With reference to paragraph 3 of your letter under reply I am directed ito state that, should the examination of the pearl banks be finally decided upon by the Government of India and should Mr. Hornell’s services be required for the purpose, His Excellency the Governor in Council wall have no objection to place Mr. Hornell’s services at the disposal of the Government of India for such periods as may be necessary between November next and March 1912 in accordance with the programme given in paragraph 10 of his letter dated the 11th July 1911 . As regards the cost df his deputation the Government of ^Madras are not quite sure whether Mr.iHornell will he regarded as on foreign service or not. if he is regarded as on foreign service they would recommend ?that he should be given the maximum salary admissible under the foreign ser vice rules. If, however, Mr. Hornell will not be regarded as on foreign service and if the only extra remuneration which will be admissible to him will be a deputation allowance equal to one-fifth of his pay under article 81 , Civil Service Regulations, I am to suggest that in view of the expensive arduous and possibly hazardous nature of the duties he is to perform, he should also be granted a special rate of travelling allowance of Rs. 10 per diem during the periods which he may have to spend in the Persian Gulf and in going there and returning therefrom. 3 . Mr. Hornell desires to make early arrangements connected with his private affairs if the Government of India decides that he should go to the Persian Gulf this cold weather. It w ill be necessary, moreover, to consider what should be done to provide for his official duties here during his absence. I am therefore to ask that the Government of India will kindly wire as early as possible whether he will be required this cold weather or not. 4 . The proof copy of Appendix E to the Persian Gulf Gazetteer which deals with the pearl fishing industry is herewith returned as requested. From—J ames Hoenell, Esq., F. L. S., Superintendent of Pearl and Chank Fisheries, Tuticorin, To—S ie Fredeeick Nicholson, K. C. I. E., Honorary Director, Madras Fisheries With reference to the papers relating to the alleged depletion of the Persian Gulf Pearl Banks, forwarded under endorsement No. 1068 -A/ll-l-Revenue, dated 28 th June 1911 , and which you have handed to me for comment, I have the honour to report as follows. 2. Erom perusal of Appendix E to the Persian 'Gulf Gazetteer (which is included among the papers referred to above), I observe that whereas the customs and methods of pearl fishing and all commercial matters relating to this trade are known in adequate detail and the locations of the pearl hanks have been carefully chartered, there is no real or exact knowledge of the life history of the pearl oyster itself nor of the. environment under which it exists— confusion even exists with regard to the correlation of. the Arabic and scientific names of the principal species {vide foot-note page 3 ). Dated Tuticorin, the 11 th July 1911 . Madras.3. Appreciating tlie motives underlying the suggestion made by Colonel Cox that the enquiry should be carried out after the close of the pearl-fishing season in October, T believe I could gain the requisite information at the season and under the'conditions suggested by Colonel Cox, although it is certainly a handicap to the investigation not to be able to see the fishery actually in progress. 4 . The principal points which, at the present moment, I consider I must either settle or have full information upon before coming to conclusions which will enable a definite line of policy to be formulated for the restoration (and subsequent continuance) of prosperity to the pearl fishery are the following, namely : — (a) Satisfactory scientific identification of the various species of pearl oysters found in the Gulf. (b) The collection of definite information upon the differences which characterize the habitual or normal environment of these species. We must know what conditions favour their increase respectively both numerically and in respect to individual size. The exact physical and biological condition of a number of the principal pearl banks must be ascertained with precision. (*) Knowledge (d) (e) of the principal dangers which beset the oyster in the course of its life. We have to ascertain whether the same natural enemies of the pearl oyster are present in the Persian Gulf as are found in Indian and Ceylon waters; more particularly must we learn what fish foes are present and the extent, if possible, of their depredations. We have also to learn whether the nature of the irritant which induces the production of pearls is the same as in the case of the gredt majority of Ceylon pearls. If it be found to originate from the larva of a worm parasite, then an investigation of the life- cycle of this parasite becomes of supreme importance. Lastly, an examination of the coast line and territorial waters of Bahrein should be made with a view to find suitable places where nurseries for young oysters may be established if found desirable. Other points of importance are likely to suggest themselves as the enquiry proceeds and knowledge of the general situation increases. 5 . In order to settle the foregoing problems it will be necessary : — (a) To spend several weeks afloat upon an examination of the banks and their surroundings by means of the dredge, and, if possible, with the assistance of a pump-driver. (Possibly the steamer detailed for the purpose of the enquiry may already carry a driver as part of the usual complement). {Jb) Several weeks ashore at some centre adjacent to the pearl banks where an extensive fishery for food fishes is carried on, and where large numbers of the fishes which frequent the neighbourhood of the banks may be obtained for dissection in order that those that are enemies of pearl oysters may be determined by means of an examination of their teeth and the contents of their stomachs, and the life history of the pearl-inducing worm-larva made out by examination of the parasitic worms infesting those fishes found to prey upon oysters. Some of these fishes may also have to be kept alive for some time in cages placed in the sea in order to verify the deductions arrived at consequent upon these dis sections. This period spent ashore, would also afford opportunity to examine the coast line of the neighbourhood for suitable positions for oyster(c) Finally, after conclusion of active investigation in the Gulf, sufficient time should be allotted to the working up of the data and material obtained at some centre, Calcutta preferably, where facilities exist for the proper examination of the parasitic and peai 1 formation material, and where there are opportunities to consult an extensive scientific (zoological) library and have the assistance of large zoological collections for reference in identification, etc. Ihe period required for this purpose depends upon the extent and importance of the material obtained, hurther, time to write a detailed account of observations, results and conclusions would also be needed, but this may be done at my own head quarters in Madras, 6. For the work afloat I consider that a full three weeks upon the pearl banks is the minimum time requisite for the collection of the needful data regarding the nature of the principal banks and the environment in which pearl oysters live. For a similar investigation of the Ceylon banks (which occupy much smaller area) the Ceylon Government in the first instance put a steamer at the disposal of Professor Herdman and myself for one month's work on the banks; this period proved insufficient and the charter had to be extended to six weeks. 7 . The work ashore will presumably occupy a longer period and must depend upon circumstances; upon weather, the supply of the right kind of fishes in the bazaar and upon the chance of early or tardy success in the hunt for the adult of the local pearl including parasite. However, if fishes for examination be scarce, the time may be usefully employed in examining the nature of shallow inshore waters where pearl fishing is carried on in winter by means of wading during low tides, also in prospecting the coast for sheltered localities where oyster nurseries may be established. The period necessary for this section of the work cannot be counted upon as less than one month; it may extend longer as it is work dependent upon outside circumstances especially upon the supply of material available in the fish markets. The investigator can do little to expedite matters except in so far as to utilise every opportunity that may occur. 8. The task of working up the zoological data after return to India should be done at the Indian Museum, Calcutta, where the only satisfactory facilities, at present existing in India for this, are to be found. I believe that the Superintendent would be able and willing to give the necessary accommodation in one of the Museum Laboratories. One month would be none too long a period for this most essential section of the investigation. 9 . A preliminary report indicating the main conclusions (subject however to amendment in the final report) would probably be possible of submission immediately after return to India. The final and detailed report might have to be deferred till some months later as the material and data that will be obtained and which must necessarily be carefully examined and tabulated, will probably be very diverse and extensive. I venture to assume that the Govern ment of India will desire that, so far as circumstances may permit, this enquiry shall be detailed and exhaustive in order that the permanent value of the investigation may be as high as possible and obviate any need to go over the same ground in subsequent years. 10 . If the foregoing line of the proposed investigation be approved, a rough time table may be suggested as follows, namely: November 1st, 1911. —Leave Madras for Bombay and Karachi. About November Leave Karachi for pearl banks off Bahrein. November loth to December 7th —Examination of the pearl banks. December 7th. —Leave the steamer landing at Bahrein and begin shore work after and in consultation with the Political Agent. December 7th to January 10th, im-Shore work in the Bahrein territory. January 10th {or thereahouts).—L&lt;iwe by mail steamer for Karachi and Madras, whence after attending to any urgent worn involvedV ‘v' r f y 4 by my duties in the Madras Fisheries Department (say 2 to 3 weeks) I might proceed to Calcutta for the work of examin ing in detail the material brought back—probably one month’s work. I may say here that adequate means of reference for the proper identification and description of specimens do not exist either in Madias or Bombay. 11 . 12. As it is considered inadvisable to let the object be known of my visit to the Gulf, 1 venture to suggest that a subsidiary mission be nominally entrusted to me, namely, the investigation of the general marine fauna of the pearl banks of the Persian Gulf. In any case, I shall have to haunt the fish markets in search of oyster-eating fishes and I shall have to collect all the fish parasites possible, together wdth a general collection of the animals living in association with the pearl oysters. If this suggestion be acted upon and if I be landed on the Arab Coast as an ordinary marine Zoologist or Collector, suspicion, I think, would not be aroused and my actions would be viewed probably as merely those of a harmless lunatic. I should of course greatly like, if it be at all possible, to take advantage of the opportunities offered to set on foot practical experiments in the rearing of oyster brood in inshore nurseries, as by so tdoing at an early stage in the investigation much information of the utmost subsequent practical importance would be gained forthwith, and eventually ■ remedial measures would thereby be advanced by a whole year. 13. Preliminary arrangements .—If I be deputed for this investigation, it will be very desirable to arrange for the plotting upon a large scale chart of the positions occupied by the chief diving fleets during the present season^ as suggested in the last sentence of paragraph 3 of Colonel Cox’s letter dated 19th May 1911. The suggestion made in the same paragraph that samples to show the nature of the bottom may be obtained by His Majesty’s ship on duty in the north of the Gulf is not of the same importance and may I think be omitted, as I can learn more real information from a single sample obtained by myself than from a hundred gathered otherwise. But it is vitally important to know the exact position where fishing may have taken place immediately before my inspecton as I shall desire to note the condition of a bank after the close of a fishery thereon. I should also like to have a copy of Appendix F of the Persian Gulf ‘Gazetteer placed at my disposal for reference for the time of the investigation (the copy sent is herewith returned as desired). 14. Further, I shall be obliged if the Commander of the “ Patrick Stewart” be asked to furnish me with a note of the number, size and fashion of the dredger available on board; if a fish trawl (beam or otter) be carried by the ship and if the vessel be furnished with a self-registering thermometer for taking the temperature of the sea at the bottom and with a delicate hydrometer for testing the specific gravity of sea water (not a boiler hydrometer) and if so, what make it is.

A., dated 15 th April 1911 . regarding the reported with Foreign Department 2 . It seems to be agreed that the position calls for expert local examination before any final conclusion can be arrived at as to the measures which can LJ be instituted in order to maintain the prosperity of the fisheries, and the Govern- ment of India are prepared to depute an expert for the purpose. The immediate question for decision is as to when and how the latter should pursue his investi gations. 3 . From the political point of view it would be less likely to excite gossip and uneasiness among the Arab population if the work could be carried out in the off season when there are no dhows on the pearl banks ; and though it would of course be more satisfactory to the expert, if he could move about freely and make his enquiries while the fishing operations were in progress, yet, (referring to paragraph 8 of Mr. Hornell’s letter of 6 th March) there seems to be a very small proportion of the information required which is not either available already or which could not be obtained in the off season. Thus, as regards the details of the fishery and the working methods of the diving fraternity, full information will be found in the paper compiled by Mr. J. G. Lorimer for the Persian Gulf Gazeteer. If the volume containing this article is not issued, the Government of India could perhaps place the draft confidentially at Mr. Hornell’s disposal. As to the precise nature of the bottom where the pearl oysters live, His Majesty’s Ship on duty in the north of the Gulf this season for the suppression of piracy, could probably obtain sufficient material casually, without attracting any comment ; failing that she could accurately fix the latitude and longitude of the positions of the chief pearling fleets during the present season, and those spots could be fully examined by the expert at the beginning of next cold weather. 4 . The Government of India will appreciate my anxiety, in making the foregoing suggestions, to avoid troublesome gossip and misrepresentation, and with the same motive I would again venture to advocate the employment of the “Patrick Stewart ,, for the expert’s tour, if it can possibly be arranged. This vessel is equipped with all necessary gear; her officers are experienced in dredg ing operations both in shallow and deep waters, and coming up straight from Karachi for two or three weeks’ cruise she would be independent of local bakers, dubashes, etc., from the Gulf Ports. It is the necessity for the employment of such people by the Naval and Indian Marine ships on duty in the Gulf, which makes it impossible to keep the doings of such vessels from soon becoming public property.From The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To The Hon*hie Mr. 1, Butterwcrth, Acting Secretary to the Government of Madras, Revenue Department, Dated Simla, the 13th June 1911.

I am directed to enclose, for the information of the Secretary of * at o/o xn -r-, - State for Foreign Affairs, a copy 1911, with enclosure.' “ * of a letter 8 from the Government of India on the question of encouraging British firms to interest themselves in the pearl-buying business in the Persian Gulf. In view of the fact that Europeans are already engaged in the local trade, there may be some advantage in adopting the suggestion of the Government of India to bring the matter to the notice of qualified British firms. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the population of the coast and islands lives mainly on the collection of pearls, and the introduction of any scientific system of fishing from the outside would lead to serious complications. To some extent, such a result might be stimulated by the increased interest in the fisheries which would be caused by the presence of expert agents of purchasing firms. Before addressing the Board of Trade on the subject, hn would, therefore, be glad to know whether the suggestion commends itself to Sir E. Grey. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.

India Office, T x , 30tb June 1904. 1 , XI ai ? /r directe(1 hy Mr * Secretar y Brodrick to forward, to be laid before the Marquess of Lansdowne, a copy of a letter from the Govern- I 1 ndia lr } the Secret department, No. 63, dated 10th March 1904, on the subject of the policy to be pursued in order to prevent any interference by foreign enterprise with the rights enjoyed by the tribes under our protection in the pearl fisheries on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. Tne attention of the Government of India has again been called to the question by the proceedings of two Erenchmen who visited Bahrein in 1903, with the intention of prospecting the pearl fisheries round the island. The Chief of Bahrein refused to entertain their proposals, but it is reported that they are taking steps to procure from Europe the means of conducting fishing operations. No immediate action is necessary, but having regard to the serious nature of the situation which would arise if interlopers commenced fishing operations on pearl banks in respect of which the tribes would look to us to defend their monopoly, the Government of India request the opinion of His Majesty’s Government on the policy to be pursued in the event of such a contingency arising. The question of policy, as the Government of India indicate, is governed by that of the extent of the legal powers of intervention against foreign intrusion possessed by the British Government in virtue of their agreements with the tribes. The result of these agreements, under which the use of armed boats by the Ch efs is prohibited, has been to impose on us the responsibility for the maintenance of order in these waters, and the obligation to defend, so far as they can reasonably be substantiated, the rights of the tribes in the fisheries. A report by the Legal Adviser to this Office on the questions of law raised in the Government of India’s Despatch is enclosed, and Mr. Brodrick would suggest that the matter should be submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown with a view to ascertain the extent to which the Government of India might be authorised to intervene against interlopers, whether foreigners or British subjects, should the necessity arise. There can be no question, in Mr. Brodrick’s opinion, of the extreme desirability of securing to the tribes in the future the monopoly which they have hitherto enjoyed. The material facts may be stated as follows : — 1 . The pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. They extend, as shown on the charts enclosed with the Govern ment of India’s Despatch, from Umm-ul-Kawain to near the head of the Gulf. His Majesty’s Government has agreements with the Arab Chiefs of Ras-al-KTiaimah, Umm-al-Kawain, Ajman, Shargah, Debai, Abu Dthabi and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs have practically surrendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The question of making a similar agreement with the Sheikh of El Katr is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. North of Bahrein the sovereignty over the western shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territories of the Sheikh of Koweit, whose special relations with His Majesty’s Government are known to the Secretary of State tor Foreign Affairs.2. Apparently all the tribes fish for pearls wherever they are to be found, and no tribe has exercised a right excluding the other tribes from any part of the fishery. 3 . Only members of the tribes have hitherto fished for pearls m the waters. 4 . (&gt;«) Portions of some of the pearl banks lie within the three-mile territorial limit. (b) Some of the banks extend from within the three-mile territorial limit outwards for several miles. (c) Some of the pearl banks are entirely outside the three-mile territorial limit. In all these cases the tribes have exercised an exclusive right for fishing for pearls. 5. The tribes have not fished for pearls in the deep waters off the banks, having no appliances for deep water fishing. It is apprehended that diving for pearls in such deep waters would materially injure the pearl fishery on the banks, and it is desired, if possible, to prevent dredging in such deep waters. 6 . The action to be taken for the protection of the pearl fishery would appear to depend on ( 1 ) the legal right of the tribes to a monopoly, and (2) the power of the British Government to act on their behalf. It is conceived that some precise delegation of authority to the British Government to act on behalf of the tribes in this matter would be necessary. 7. Tiie Law Officers would probably advise as to the legal rights of the tribes within and also without the three-mile territorial limit, and as to the nature and extent of the delegation to be obtained, and further as to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Goixley. Foreign Office. Annex. Report by the Legal Adviser to the India Office, dated 12 th April 1904. Two distinct questions are raised in the Despatch of the Government of India. 1 . First, there is the question whether the British Government is in a position to assert and vindicate the rights possessed by the Chiefs over the waters which adjoin their territories. This, it seems to me, is a question of fact. If it is correct to say that the Chiefs have all agreed to leave the protection of their interests in the hands of the British Government, then the existence or non-existence of a treaty defining their relations or imposing on the Government the obligation of affording that protection does not seem to me material. So long as anv act done by officers of the Government can be proved to have been done under the authority of the Chiefs whose territory may be concerned, then those officers have, I think, a complete defence [see Carr v. Times, 1902, A.C. 176). Nor do I think that any foreign kState could complain of such an act, provided of course that it was an act which, if done bv the Chief himself, would not have transgressed the rules of Internationaf law. . 2 ; As regards the extent of the jurisdiction of a State beyond the limits of its own shores, I do not think I can do better than cite the opinion of the Law Officers of the Government of India in the case of the Meigui pearl fisheries, that opinion having been approved bv the Law Officers of the Crown. They wrote as' follows: “We are of “ opinion that the British Government possesses territorial jurisdiction “ over sea within a belt or zone of three miles from the shores of&lt; tbe mainland of the provinces of Zeh, Tavoy, Mergui,and Tenasserim, an( t 0 1 islands appertaining thereto, including the Mergui ‘‘Archipelago; as also over all bays, gulfs, and estuaries inter fauces “ terra, whether of such mainland or islands, hut no further.” While adopting the opinion as correct, the Law Officers of the Crown add, with icfeience to the Australian and Ceylon fisheries : “The Australian “ Pearl. Pi slier y Acts are limited in their operation to British subjects, “ an( l assume that, in the case of the pearl fisheries in the Mergui Archipelago, there has not been, as in the case of the Ceylon fisheries, “ an immemorial claim to the pearl-oyster fishery beyond the usual “ territorial waters asserted by successive rulers and 'acquiesced in.” (Acc Revenue, Statistics, and Commerce Papers, 1893, December.) This opinion, it is to be observed, was given after the publication of the award in the Behring Sea Arbitration, which took place in August, of the same year. In that arbitration a claim similar to that suggested in the sixth paragraph of the Despatch was put forward on behalf of the United States ; it was met by strong arguments on behalf of the British Government {see Chapter VIII. of British Case and Argument, p. 36), and was negatived by the award. With regard to the Ceylon precedent, which among others was relied on by the United States in support of their claim to a right of some sort extending beyond the three-mile limit, it is pointed out in the argument that these fisheries “ have been “ treated from time immemorial by the successive rulers of the Island “ as subjects of property and jurisdiction, and have been so regarded “ with the acquiescence of all other nations.” The Ceylon case thus stated is, in fact, one which illustrates the proposition that a portion of the high sea may be appropriated by dint of actual occupation in the same way as land may be so occupied. If a similar assertion of owner ship and acquiescence could he proved with regard to the fisheries in the Persian Gulf outside the three-mile limit, I think those fisheries would he taken to he included within the territory of the State to which they are contiguous. Otherwise, the three-mile limit must prevail, for that is the rule which a State is supposed to adopt in the absence of express notice that a larger extent is claimed {see Hail on International Law, p. 154). In order to apply the above principles to the case of any particular fishing ground (for I presume there are distinct fishing grounds), it may he necessary to institute a more detailed inquiry than has already been made, so that it may he decided whether in that particular case it is expedient to assert a claim by right of occupation larger than that which the ordinary rule would justify.

India Office, Sir, 10th August 1904. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Brodrick to acknowledge the receipt of Sir E. Gorst’s letter of the 16th ultimo, informing him that the Marquess of Lansdowne concurs in the proposal to refer to the Law Officers of the Crown the question of the steps to be taken to prevent foreign interference with the rights enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf in the pearl fisheries. Mr. Brodrick is of opinion that, should Lord Lansdowne see no objection, the case to be laid before the Law Officers, which involves considerations of international law, might more conveniently be stated by your Department; but I am to enclose a copy of a Memorandum stating the material facts. Should Lord;Lansdowne concur in the proposed course, Mr. Brodrick will be glad to see a draft of the case before it is actually laid before the Law Officers. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Foreign Office. Annex. Pearl Fisheries in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum. The Government of India have called the attention of His Majesty’s Government in the annexed letter to the fact that by the steps they have consistently taken for more than a century to maintain the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf, they have deprived the Arab Chiefs on the coast of the means of forcibly protecting their interests in the pearl fisheries, and that they therefore feel themselves to he under an obligation to defend those rights in so far as they can reasonably be I hey cite instances in the past in which they have have successfully intervened to prevent the intrusion both of 'foreigners, by diplomatic means, and of British subjects. They recognise, however, that the position is difficult, both in regard to British subjects and from the point of view of international Taw. They therefore desire to ascertain the extent to which thev may be authorised to intervene, should the necessity arise.== I The material facts may be stated as follows :— 1. The pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Bahrein. They’extend, as shown on the charts enclosed with the Government of India’s letter, from Um-ul- Kawain to near the head of tne Gulf. Plis Majesty’s Government has identical agreements with the Arab Chiefs of Ras-ul-Khaimah, Uni-uh Kawain, Ajman, Shargah, Behai, Abu Bthabi and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs have practically surrendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The territory of these Chiefs comprises the Arabian coast of the Gulf off which the pearl banks lie up to the island of Bahrein, with the exception of the promontory of El Katr, with whose Chief the question of making a similar agreement is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. North of Bahrein the sovereignty over the Arabian shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit, who has special relations with His Majesty’s Government. 2. Apparently all the tribes fish for pearls wherever they are to be found ; and no tribe has exercised a right excluding the other tribes from any part of the fishery. 3. Only members of the tribes have hitherto fished for pearls in these waters. 4-. (a) Portions of some of the pearl banks lie within the three-mile territorial limit. (b) Some of the banks extend from within the three-mile limit outwards for several miles. (&lt;?) Some of the banks are entirely outside the three-mile limit. In all these cases the tribes have exercised an exclusive and concurrent right of fishing for pearls. 5 . The tribes have not fished for pearls in the deep waters off the banks, having no appliances for deep water fishing. It is apprehended that dredging for pearls in such deep waters would materially injure the pearl fishery on the banks ; and it is desired, if possible, to prevent dredging in such deep waters. 6 . The action 1 o be taken for the protection of the pearl fishery would appear to depend on ( 1 ) the legal right of the tribes to a monopoly ; and (2) the power of the British Government to act on their behalf, in maintaining that monopoly. It is conceived that some precise delegation of authority to the British Government to act on behalf of the tribes in this matter would be necessary. It must be added that none of the tribes have any judicial system or courts of law for dealing with trespassers or trespassing boats. 7. The Law Officers might be asked to advise as to the legal rights of the tribes within, and also without, the three-mile territorial limit; and as to the nature and extent of the delegation to be obtained; and, further, as to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances.

Lord Lansdowne would be glad to receive any observations which Mr. Brodrick may be good enough to offer on the matter after considering this Report. I am, &amp;e., The Under Secretary of State (Sd.) Omitted. for India. Annex. Law Officers of the Crown to Foreign Office. Law Officers’ Department, Royal Courts of Justice, My Lord, 11 th February 1905. We were honoured with your Lordship’s commands, signified in Sir Eldon Gorst’s letter of the 19th October last, transmitting to us the accompanying papers, relative to the question of the steps to be taken to prevent foreign interference with the rights enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf in the pearl fisheries, and requesting us to favour your Lordship with our opinion— (1) As to the legal rights of the tribes within, as also without, the the three-mile territorial limit. (2) As to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers, and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. 'We have taken the matter into our consideration, and, in obedience to your Lordship’s commands, have the honour to report-— (1) That the tribes have a right to the exclusive use of the pearl fisheries within the three-mile limit, and in any other waters which may justly be considered territorial. S. 5. CAs regards the lislieries beyond territorial waters, we think that a distinction must be drawn between the banks where the tribes have practised pearl fishing and the deep waters in which no such fishery has been carried on by them. As regards the pearl banks, we think that, as a matter of inter national law, they are capable of being the property of the tribes to the exclusion of all nations. In addition to the passage cited from Vattel, reference may be made to Puffendorfs Treatise de jure Naturae et gentium,” Book IV., Chapter V., Section 7, and to the recent work of Professor Westlake, “ International Law,” Part 1., chapter 9, at pages 186 and 187, and the ease of the protection of the Ceylon pearl banks is a striking illustration of the assertion of this right in practice. Whether such rights, in fact, exist with regard to these particular pearl banks in the Persian Gulf is a question the answer to which cannot be given with any certainty, as it depends on the evidence available of historical facts with reference to the enjoyment of these fisheries by the tribes and the exclusion of others from them. As far as we can judge, upon the materials before us, we think that there are grounds for asserting the existence of such an exclusive right, and we do not think that, in point of law, the fact that the enjoyment was by the tribes in common would prevent the acquisition of the right in question. Having regard to the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the tribes on the west shore of the Persian Gulf, we think that the existence of this exclusive right may be properly maintained on their behalf by His Majesty’s Government With regard to the deep waters in which pearl fishing lias not been carried on by the tribes we think the case is different. There is here no defined area at the bottom of the sea over which the right of fishing has been exercised to the exclusion of other nations, as there is some ground for saying was the case with regard to the pearl banks. We cannot see that the light claimed by the tribes to exclude other nations from these deeper waters could be asserted with any reasonable chance of success. (2) Having regard to the importance of protecting the deeper waters and to the fact that for the reasons above indicated it cannot be regarded as certain that the right, even to the pearl hanks, could be established to the satisfaction of any international tribunal, we think that it would be preferable to discourage foreign interference by refusing supplies, &amp;c., as suggested in the papers before us. If such measures prove inadequate it may be necessary, having obtained the authority of the Chiefs for this purpose, to compel the removal of vessels engaged in fishing on the pearl banks. Of course, measures of this kind must be taken with caution, as international complications might result from any precipitate action. It might also be practicable—whether it should he done or not is a matter of policy—to raise the question in a form suitable for decision by the Hague Tribunal. Pishing within the territorial waters may, of course, be prevented. Generally. We desire to add that, having regard to the importance of the question to the tribes, and the fact that we cannot be certain of establishing the right claimed, it is probably desirable that the fishing by foreigners should, if possible, be indirectly stopped without raising the question internationally.

The pearl banks on the Persian shore are, as Your Highness is aware, visited by boats from the Arabian as well as the Persian shores, the inhabitants of which are allowed to fish on payment of fees to the local authorities. On 18th June 1900 I informed the Persian Government, in obedience to instructions from Lord Salisbury, that His Majesty’s Government could not recognise any contract which would interfere with the established rights of Chiefs under British protection. Your Highness will agree that any infraction of these rights, hitherto enjoyed, would inevitably lead to grave complications, which both Governments wish to avoid, as well as to the increase of the patrol duties, already sufficiently heavy, of the ships of the two Governments; and from this point of view I am to inform Your Highness, in anticipation, that His Majesty’s Government will view with grave concern any open or tacit amplification of the Sponge Concession as communicated to His Majesty’s Legation in December last.

With regard to their enquiry as to whether there would be any objection to the concessions being financed by clients of theirs, Sir E. Grey would be glad to be furnished with Mr. Secretary Morley’s views as to whether, since it appears impossible to do anything towards the cancelling of the concessions, it would not be desirable to encourage British capital to take them up in order to obviate the danger of their falling into the bands of foreigners.

With reference to your letter of 7th February 1906 relative to the affairs of the Sponge Exploration Syndicate, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a letter from Messrs. Paddison, Trevor, and He La Chapelle, who are acting as solicitors to that association, forwarding a translation of the concession granted by the Sultan of Muscat, and soliciting a declaration from His Majesty’s Government that the terms of this document in no way infringe the rights of other persons protected by the commercial Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat, and that His Majesty’s Government recognise the concession as being perfectly in order. A comparison of the translation forwarded herewith with that of the same concession which formed the enclosure in your letter of 11 th January 1906 reveals the existence of an important discrepancy between the two, viz., that whereas the preamble of the India Office version only states that the Sultan gives the Syndicate the “ permission to produce sponges from ” his “ waters,” that of Messrs. Paddison’s version declares that he leases to them “ the sea of ” his “ kingdoms ” for this purpose. It appears to Sir E. Grey that, if the translation of the concession now given by Messrs. Paddison rightly reproduces the sense of the original text, that instrument does, in fact, grant to the Syndicate an exclusive right to fish for sponges in Muscat waters during the period of the lease, and thereby constitutes a violation of the Treaty above referred to. I am accordingly to request that, should Mr. Secretary Morley see no objection, steps may be taken to ascertain from the Government of India, who are understood to be in possession of a copy of the original text of this concession, which translation is the correct one, and I am to inquire whether, should it be shown that Messrs. Paddison’s version is accurate, this discovery would not modify the opinion expressed in your letter of 7th February 1906, that the concession cannot be held to be a violation of Article IV. of the Treaty of 1891. I am further to draw your attention to the passage common to both versions of the preamble, in which it is stated that the permission or right to fish for sponges is granted to the Syndicate to a distance of ten miles in breadth, and I am to state that, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, the Sultan of Muscat and the Sponge Exploration Syndicate, Limited, should be informed that His Majesty’s Government are unable torecognise the right of the former to confer such a privilege outside of the territorial waters and over the high seas situate between three ana ten miles from the coast.

In my Despatch No. 275 of 7th November last, I had the honour to transmit to you copy of a note which I had addressed to the Persian Government warning them that the concession which they had recently granted for sponge fishing in the Persian Gulf might be abused, and that any amplification of it which might interfere with the pearl fishery in those waters would be likely to raise serious difficulties. _ I now have the honour to transmit further correspondence which has passed between the Persian Foreign Office and this Legation on the subject. . You will see from the Ala es Sultaneh’s note of the 19th ultimo that the Persian Government deny that the Sponge Syndicate are authorised to interfere in any way with the pearl fishery in the Gulf. As the concession to the National Bank contained a clause giving the Bank the right of exploiting the Persian pearl fisheries, I considered it would be prudent to enter a renewed caveat as to the rights acquired by British protected Arabs, by way of lease. I explained verbally to the Foreign Minister the purpose of my note, and he assured me that, according to Mahommedan law, due respect would be paid to acquired rights in any concession made to the National Bank or any othei institution. 1 have, Ac., The Right Hon.

In reply to your note, and for your information, I have the honour to state that no right whatever has been given by the Persian Government to the Sponge Exploration Syndicate for pearl fishery. If the Syndicate is carrying on any operation it is in connection with the sponge fishery. The Syndicate has so far not applied for, nor has the Persian Government thought of, granting the right of fishing for pearls. If any information with regard to this matter has reached the British Government, the Persian Government has none. If such a measure has been taken by the Chiefs, or if the British Government has discovered that they have taken such a measure, I request that the Persian Government may be notified, in order that the necessary inquiries may be made, and, if proved to be true, steps for its prevention may be taken. You stated in your note under reply that “ the pearl banks on the “ Persian shore are visited by boats from the coasts of Arabia as well as “ Persia, the inhabitants of which are allowed to fish on payment of fees “ to the local authorities.” You also referred to your note of the 18th June 1900. As I do not properly understand your object in making this state ment I cannot give a reply. But when you state in this connection that “ any infraction of those rights would inevitably lead to grave compli- “ cations which both Governments wash to avoid,” I have no doubt you will consider me justified in expressing surprise, for the Persian Government have always on important occasions given, and will give, proof of their desire to maintain the friendly relations between the two States, and they will never permit British subjects to suffer in their legal interests, not speaking of matters of no importance, with regard to which the Persian Government do not understand why the British Government take the trouble of making representations. Annex 3. Sir C. Spring Rice to Ala es Sultaneh. 3rd April 1907. I beg to thank you for your note of the 19th instant about the Sponge Concession. My object in writing was to prevent any incident arising owing to misapprehension which could disturb our friendly relations. . When two people aie fi lends, it is, as you know, their custom not to wait until a difficulty arises, in order to speak as to their rights. If they think that a difficulty is likely to arise, their custom is to warn each other beforehand _ in a friendly way in order that by timely action a difficulty may be avoided according to the verse “ a stitch in time saves nine ” and “prevention is better than cure.” The pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf are of course, as far as they are within the waters which belong to Persia, Persian property and no one will ever dispute these rights. But the rights have in some places been leased by the local Persian authorities to Arabs, some of whom are under British protection. If these leases are suddenly altered and annuded the Arabs wd! of course complain, and make difficulties, and these difficulties would cause difficulties between our two Governments, on or( J er . to avoid these difficulties I wrote you the letter of 20th October m order that you might know what people say who are in the Persian Gulf, namely, that Arabs living on the Arab coast have contracts giving them the right to fish for pearls in waters belono-ino- to Persia which have been given them lawfully by the local Persian Governors, and that these contracts are good and valid and cannot be cancelled without compensation. I said this for two reasons, one, because our Governments are friends and because it is better for us to warn each other beforehand of anydifficulty which is likely to arise than to quarrel after the difficulty has arisen; the other, that both our Governments are just, and when they see what is just they do not refrain from doing it. As you say, neither Government would admit that the subjects of the other, or ’its own subjects, should suffer in their legal interests. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 13,603, dated the 4th May 1907, suggesting, for Mr. Secretary Morley’s consideration, that it might be desirable to encourage British capital to take up the concessions granted by the Shah of Persia and the Sultan of Muscat to the Sponge Exploration telegrams'''' to and from the Viceroy on the subject. Mr. Morley agrees generally in the view of the Government of India that, if the enterprise is likely to be successful, the larger the share British capital has in the concern the better it will be, though he thinks it will be desirable not to commit ourselves till further information has been obtained from Messrs. Russell and Arnholz as to the constitution of the Board of Management. Before, however, any action is taken it seems necessary to clear up the question raised in your letter of the 15th May, No. 14,782, as to the exact nature and scope of the Muscat Concession. A copy of that letter, with its enclosures, has been sent out to the Government of India, who have been asked to telegraph their views as soon as possible.

We consider that, if Syndicate has proof of existence of profitable sponge beds, the more British capital embarked in the venture the better. We may point out that it may be possible for us, if necessary, to induce the Sultan to refuse foreign companies admission on the Arabian shore, seeing that syndicates are given no power of alienation under Muscat Concession. Enclosure No. 8 . India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 16th July 1907. In continuation of my letter of the 29th May, on the subject of the concessions granted to the Sponge Exploration Syndicate by the Persian Government and the Sultan of Muscat, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to enclose, to be submitted to the Secretary of * TW J &gt; 7 ru T T / i i • State for Foreign Affairs, copy of # Dated 7tli July 1907 (sent to Foreign , i T7 . Office 8 th July). a telegram- from the Viceroy, stating that the translation of the Muscat Concession forwarded with the letter from this Office of the 11 th January 1906 is correct. The Muscat Concession is thus not open to the objections based on the translation furnished by the Concessionnaires which were expressed in your letter of the 15th May, No. 14,782. But as regards the per mission to fish for sponges “to a distance of 10 miles in breadth,” to which attention was called in that letter, it will be seen that the Government of India agree that the Syndicate and the Sultan of Muscat should^ be informed that His Majesty’s Government are unable to recognise the right of the latter to confer such a privilege beyond the limit of Muscat territorial waters ; and Mr. Morley proposes to instruct the Government of India to inform the Sultan accordingly. Ihe attention of Messrs. Russell and Arnholz will doubtless be called, as proposed in your letter of the 4th May, to the fact that the Muscat Concession is for 15 years only and does not grant an exclusive right to fish for sponges. _ Tim Persian Concession, it is observed, is for 50 years and grants exclusive rights. As regards the question raised in your letter of 4th May last, No. lo, 60 o, whether it might not be desirable, since it is impracticable to proeme the cancellation of the concessions, to encourage British capital to take them up in order to obviate the danger of their falling into the hands ^of foreigners, I am to refer to my letter of the 29th May last.

Foreign Office, Gentlemen, August 1907. ^ With reference to my letter No. 20,633, of the 21st ultimo, relative to the concession for the fishing for sponges granted by the Sultan of Muscat to the Sponge Exploration Syndicate, Limited, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to inform you that a report on the subject has been received from the Government of India. I am in the first place to explain that there was found to be an important discrepancy between the wording of the translation of the concession forwarded by you in your letter of 3rd May, and that which had already reached this Department through the India Office, and of which a copy is enclosed herewith, for whereas the preamble of the latter only states that the Sultan gives the Syndicate the permission to produce sponges from his waters, that of your version declares that he “ leases ” to them the “ sea of his Kingdoms ” for this purpose. If the latter were the correct translation of the Arabic text the concession would grant to the Syndicate an exclusive right to fish for sponges in Muscat waters during the period of the lease, and would, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, constitute a violation of Article IV. of the treaty between Great Britain and Muscat of 19th July 1891, which forbids the establishment of any kind of monoply or exclusive privilege of trade in the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat. The Government of India, having now compared both versions with the original text, have declared their own version to be the correct one, so that the concession is not open to objection on this score. With regard, however, to the statement contained in the preamble of both versions alike that the permission or right to fish for sponges is granted to a distance of 10 miles in breadth, I am to point out that His Majesty’s Government are unable to recognise the right of the Sultan of Muscat to confer such a privilege outside the territorial waters and over high seas situated between 3 and 10 miles from the coast, and that it is proposed to make a communication in this sense to the Sultan. I am to add that if the syndicate or company formed to work the concession—subject, of course, to the above-mentioned limitations—is able to satisfy His Majesty’s Government that it is a bond fide British undertaking and is satisfactorily constituted, and that it is willing to respect the rights of the Arab tribes in the pearl fisheries, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to assure it of their due support in the legitimate exploitation of its concession.

Grey to inform you that His Majesty’s Government are aware of the granting of these concessions, but that whereas the Persian concession is for 50 years, and grants exclusive rights to fishSultan of Muscat. The preamble of the Muscat Concession, however, states that the permission to fish for sponges is granted to a distance of 10 miles in q 18 f a i r est T’ s Government are unable to recognise the right o tne bultan of Muscat to confer such a privilege outside the territorial waters, and over high seas situated between 3 and 10 miles from i 6 anc ^ P ro P ose to make a communication in this sense to tijtio bultan.

In reply to your letter No. 23,778, dated the 6 th August 1907, as to the concessions granted to the Sponge Exploration Syndicate by the Shah of Persia and the Sultan of Muscat, I am directed to state that Mr. Secretary Morley concurs in the drafts of the replies which Secretary Sir E. Grey proposes to make to Messrs. Paddison, Trevor, and de la Chapelle, and to Messrs. Russell and Arnholz. The Government of India will now be informed of the action which is being taken in this country, and will be instructed to intimate to the Sultan of Muscat that His Majesty’s Government are unable to recognise his right to confer the privilege of fishing for sponges outside his own territorial waters and over the high seas situate between 3 and 10 miles from the coast.

I have, etc., (vSd.) G. F. Paddison, for Ag: Secretary to Government. I-! i r*Copy of letter from James Hornell, Esquire, F•L•S*, Marine assistant, Madras Fisheries Bureau and Superintendent, x^earl and Ohank Fisheries, dated 6th March 1911, to the Secretary to lovernment, itevenue Department, through the Honorary Director of Fisheries, Madras In accordance with the direction contained in your Endorsement Ho. 279A/ll~l He venue, dated 22nd February 1911, I have the honour to reply as below upon the reference of letter from the Government of India, Foreign Department, Ho. 245 E.A., dated 7th February 1911, with which were forwarded papers bearing upon an apparent depletion of the Pearl Banks of the Persian Gulf. 2. Upon the meagre data furnished in the above papers it is extremely difficult to give a reasoned opinion of any certain value save that it is abundantly manifest that the situation appears critical and demands immediate and detailed investigation. 3. Four points stand out clearly, namely (a) The extremely high value of the pearling industry and its consequent vital local importance, seeing that the value of the export of pearls from Bahrainalone, as given at the end of Captain Mackenzie's report, totals no less than £ 6,826,913 for the period of 1C years ending 1909, (b) The absolute lack of exact knowledge of the conditions requisite for the continued well-being of the oyster-beds. l\o examination has ever been made of the pearl banks by an expert trained in pearl- oyster culture, and local conditions are consequently unknown. (c) The steady increase in the number of boats employed in the pearl fishery is another fact of the utmost significance. Thesentails increased demands upon the beds and is bound to involve over-fishing, and cause depletion sooner or later if not regulated. Unfortunately the impossibility of placing restriction upon the number of boats attending the fishery is mentioned, and this is, I presume, a fact to be accepted for State reasons. (d) The last main fact apparent from the printed report is the lack of any measures or Regulations to ensure the continued well-being of the pearl banks other than the recent decision of certain of the Uakhodas to return empty shells to the beds. 4.4. In the light of the Ter, mauequate data p roTided. Persian half Oyster^anks, I aa inclined, to the conclusion that this pearl fishery is suffering from the direct and fishing due to the l&amp;ch of any restrictions and regulations regarding the size or age of the oysters to he fished and hanks or sections thereof. In this opinion, I an fortified tion in Ceylon and India and hy iny personal knowledge of certain Indian pearling grounds which, I 'believe, to he closely related in character to those of the C-ulf. pearl oysters he due to depletion of the 'beds and if the fishing boats cannot he restricted in nuinbers, then I am of opinion that the only means of arresting further injury to the hanks ana of gradually restoring them to their normal condition of prosperity lie in persuading tne Hakhodas to adopt a satisfactory aininum siae limit for the oysters fished ana to curry on some form oi culture incre&amp;s us^irrgly serious consequences of unrestrained over- the absence of any rotational system of fishing the various hy nine years' intimate experience of pearl fishery regula If the cause of the diminution in the harvest of inBahrain ie s^, rep o rt o. In para, i oi uhe a^oove“naaed. report appears tiie are finding, ana they also complain that on the whole such 'being fully developed and consequently there is less likelihood of obtaining pearls.' This result is precisely what one expects from persistent overfishing; once fishing hecomes to energetic that more o yste rs are remove a e ach yea r t han come annually to maturity, th en rap id d ep let! on sets in accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the quality (thickness of shell and pearl-producing capacity). 7. The belief professed by many of the bakhodas that the fertility of the banks is influenced very adversely by the non-return of the empty shells to the sea after having been opened does not seem to me likely to be valid. I am shells as are found appear to be of thinner quality than formerly, which in their opinion is due to the oysters not however always very to contemn the ideas of fishermen doubting that the present evil condition of the banks is attributableatr.ril^uta'ble to tiiis cause, I an not prepared to say that in some indirect a ay this procedure may not have certain ill consequences. It nay he that the pearling grounds a j deficient in suitable stones and smells whereupon the larvu^T of the pearl oyster may settle at the close of the free-sv.i mning stage of their life, and that in consequence the return of dead oyster shells to the sea supplies this deficiency; or it aay he that the immature oysters which adhere to the shells of the mature individuals (para. f Captain 'Tackenzi e 1 s Report) form a considerable pro portion of the yoiper generation and that by their destruc tion by the currying ashore of the old shells, the beds are deprived of much of the brood required to replenish them. 3. These questions cannot be determined v/ithout an investigation carried out on the banks; it is necessary to be acquainted exhaustively with all details ol the fisnery, to see fishing operations in progress and to knov/ with precision the character of the bottom where the oysters live the respective distribution of sand and rock and the proportion borne by hard material (rock, shells, shingle etc.) must especially be ascertained. 9 # The question of culture within territorial waters is, however, in my opinion the real and vit*.± issuex s cii© • I bslieve, vw j vtci&amp;c X jx&amp;v 6 jfsc. x i o-n 11 i*n exaaination of charts of bhe Persian Gulf, tliat concti- ions there are *.itu : :;ether better than in Ceylon for the rosecution of culture* On the latter coast owing to peculiarly adverse natural conditions, pearl fisheries ere sporadic and intermittent* Fisheries maybe held in three successive pears and then there may he absolute nlamcs for five or more years, the blanks always exceeding the number of productive years This unreliability of the Ceylon fisheries is a fact recognized since the seizure cl coe fishery by the Portuguese in the beginning of the 16th century. As a consequence, culture operations are extremely difficult to conduct, and at the present ux is, or for three years past and pr obably for another three/more years cul tu ral^ op e rat ion s are ac ou ai lyp a t _ a_ jp ands t i for lack pf_mat erial to ^ork _uppn.«_. 10 . Contrasting Phis v.lth the cone it ion of ax jaxrs in the Persian Gulf, we find that in the latter region psarl fisheries are regular and annual. They certainly vary in results fro.n year to year, hut in. no„Xear_are oys t8rs_ a: j ssn t as is ^he case with Ceylon. Consequently umple material is always at hand in th e P e r s ian wulf fo x cultural needs11 &amp; Were culture to be decided up on, there &amp;re two distinct methods of setting ^ ,/oric, viz:- (u) The production of very l-rge quantities of young oysters in nurseries v»r culture areas, whence they would be planted out in due time in suitable localities in deeper ’water when old enough to withstand the majority of their enemies* (b) The treatment of limited numbers of oysters with a view to induce in such by artificial means the production of one or more pearls. 12. The second method has not as yet emerged from the experimental stage sc far as perfect pearls are concerned, although several investigators are at work; for my own part, I have had initial success, but have not had opportunity to test the method over a sufficiently long time. Half-pearls, so called 'culture pearls', are however produced in large numbers and on a commercial scale in Japan and as I am conversant with the details of the methods pursueo, there should be no difficulty in carrying on a similar industry in some sheltered bay on the ~ ah rain coast. The artificial inducement of pearls is, I take it, altogether of minor p resent consideration to tnose methodsV aetiiods which have for their object the restoration of prosperity to the natural beds, alt no ugh there should be \ no difficulty in carrying on both concurrently* 1 14 . Careful investigation of the present condition of the beas and of such bays w*s light seem most suitable for the purpose of nurseries are the immediate requirements, pending which no useful decision can .oepome to either as to hhat fishery regulations should be instituted or what lines artificial carried on, if at all* ihe season tion should be carried out is that culture should be when such an investiga- coincident with the period when pearl-fishery is in full swing, nawelp, trom May until September during the continuance ox hot weatmer conditions.*R ;1 -j \« No. 72, dated Calcutta, the 28th January 1911 (Confidential).

I have no doubt that the Trustees would be willing, if suitable arrangements could be made, to send Mr. Kemp to the Persian Gulf to investigate the pearl banks, and would strongly recommend the Government of India to approach them as regards the question. I understand that the pearl fisheries of the Persian Gulf take place chiefly in summer, and as it will he necessary, if Mr. Kemp is to investigate the pearl hanks, that certain apparatus should be got out from Europe, it would he as well that the Trustees should he approached as soon as possible. p.^.—The paper referred to in your letter is enclosed.

The Government of India also pointed out that the ships on the East Indies Station are inlly em ployed cruising at sea, and if one were kept at Aden merely for the purpose of showing the flag, she would he diverted from the wmrk for which she has bet n commissioned.

He stated that it w r as proposed to reply that His Majesty’s Government were taking vigo rous measures, but would ascertain whether further action was possible, and he enquired whether the Government of India had any observations to offer. He also asked how far the existing regulations at Aden prevent the export of arms to places outside the zone of the Brussels Act, where importation is prohi bited by local law. The Bombay Government have been addressed on the subject. (Tttekish Arabia.) 6 . {Vide paragraph 8 of the Memoran* Irrigation works in dum for Jure 1910.} Mesopotamia. ]yj[ r&gt; Lorimer reports that two Turkish engineers are now working at the lower Zab irrigation scheme. It was not formerly intended to bring water nearer to Kirkuk town than 6 miles, but the local Mutasarrif has recommended tapping the river higher up, in order that the lands of Kirkuk itself may be irrigated, and an extended survey has been authorised. The change will, Mr. Dormer says, enormously increase the cost of8 construction, as a range of most uncompromis- ing hills must be either pierced or turned. He hears that the Turks themselves have estimated the cost of the original scheme at £T.80,000 and that of the new one at £T.150,000. As their engineers have no experience in such matters, it is probable that even these figures are illusory. (H) [Vide paragraph 6 of the Memo* randum for January 1911.] Mr. Lorimer reports that the principal event of the month, from the point of view of British interests, has been a visit to Baghdad by Sir John Jackson, the head of the great British firm of engineering contractors which bears his name, in connection with the execu tion of Sir William Willcocks* irrigation projects. Sir J. Jackson was accompanied by Mr. G. G. Eady, a partner in another engineering firm, who has been associated with him in some of his most important foreign enterprises. Mr. Eady had with him copies of cor respondence with the Turkish Minister of Public Works, from which it appeared that Sir William Willcocks was empowered by the Ministry to conclude a temporary contract with Sir J. Jackson for the carrying on of the Hindi yah Barrage and Habbaniyah Escape works, until such time as a permanent contract for the same should be given : the temporary contract, however, was only to be concluded, subject to the approval of the Governor-General of Baghdad. Sir John Jackson and Mr, Eady arrived at Baghdad on the 13th January. Mr. Lorimer introduced them to Nazim Pasha on the following day, and negotiations were immediately opened. It appeared that the Governor-General had already advised the Turkish Government against granting any temporary contract, but the difficulty arising from his having thus committed himself was successfully overcome. With one exception matters proceeded smoothly, until the signature by Nazim Pasha, on the 23rd of January, of a draft temporary contract in the name of Sir J. Jackson. The hitch arose on the 22nd January, when Eram Bey, the Wali’s Political Secretary, called on Mr. Lorimer with a suggestion that, if the contract were given, he (Mr. Lorimer) should take it as a signal mark of Nazim Pasha’s friendship for Britain and desist from opposition to His Excellency in future. The Secretary’s meaning, as Mr. Lorimer apprehended it, was that he should cease to maintain the just claims of British subjects for compensation for demolition of their houses and other wrongs suffered. Mr. Lorimer replied that the allotment of thecontract was a commercial question, which the Governor-General was bound to decide in accordance with business considerations and not with political predilections, and that he could not therefore regard it as possessing the significance with which Eram Bey would invest it. The proposal that he should pledge himself to be more accommodating in ques tions at issue with the Wilayat Mr. Lorimer repelled with indignation. Sir John Jackson left Baghdad on the 24th of January, the day after the signing of the draft temporary contract; but Mr. Eady remained behind to obtain, if pos sible, some modifications which were desired of the terms agreed upon, to sign the tem porary contract in its final form on Sir J. Jackson’s behalf, and to arrange for taking over the works in case everything were satis factorily adjusted. Everything was proceeding favourably and a number of modifications had been settled between Mr. Eady and Eram Bey, when Sir William Willcocks, who had hitherto appeared to acquiesce in all that was going forward, received a telegram from the Turkish Minister of Public Works, enquir ing whether he had himself signed the temporary contract or not. Sir William, hereupon, began to insist on his undoubted right to sign any contract that might be given; and he refused to suggest to the Minister, as Mr. Lorimer proposed, that the matter should be left to Nazim Pasha and Sir J. Jackson’s representative. He further proceeded to attack some of the conditions inserted in the drafr, contract as unfair to the Ministry of Public Works, and to him as their representative, and could not be prevailed upon to withdraw his opposition. Up to the 5th February, when Mr. Lorimer left Baghdad on tour, no way had been found out of the impasse thus created. Mr. Eady at that date intended to carry through, if possible, and to sign for what it might be worth, a suitably worded contract with the Wali alone. The Wali on his part seemed t ^ regard Mr. Eady as an ally against Sir W. Willcocks, and to be more than ever disposed for this reason to meet his views. 7. (Vide paragraph 7 of the Memoran- Affairs at Baghdad. ^On thT^th January, the Political Secretary of the Wilayat informed Mr. Lorimer verbally that the Governor-General resented his action in bring ing to notice at Constantinople the proposed expropriation of land belonging to Messrs. Lynch; he added, however, that His Excellency would not now, in view of the dilficulties that had arisen, proceed with the5 diversion of the street. The compensation which it had been decided to offer to Messrs. Lynch was at the rate of G. S. P. 80 per square metre, whereas the land was purchased four years previously at G. S. P. 130 per square metre, as can be proved from the Turkish land records. It is now, in view of a general rise of values, probably worth more than G. S. P. 300 per square metre. On the 30th January, Messrs. Lynch’s manager suddenly received a notice of the ex propriation of the land required for the diver sion, and this at the further reduced rate of G.S.P. 40 per square metre, Mr. Lorimer wrote at once semi-officially to the Governor- General, protesting in the strongest manner against tbe proposed unjust expropriation, calling attention to the unfair constitution of the committee of valuation (which was clearly a packed one), and requesting an interview with His Excellency on the sub ject. Mr. Lorimer also commented on the inconsistency of the Governor-General’s fre quent professions of friendship and goodwill with the manifest hostility of his proposed action. A reply was received from Eram Bey, to the effect that neither the Governor-General personally, nor Colonel Javad Bey (the engineer in charge of the work and a member of the committee of valuation), nor he himself knew of any disagreeable proceedings in regard to Messrs. Lynch, and that Mr. Lorimer’s letter was consequently not understood. Later, Eram Bey came to Mr. Lorimer in person professing that it had since been discovered, with the greatest regret, that a notice of expropriation had been issued to Messrs. Lynch by a mistake. He tried to induce Mr. Lorimer to admit that he believed this excuse, but Mr. Lorimer declined to do so. The next morning Eram Bey wrote to Mr. Lorimer a long private letter with the same object as before, and made a scene with Mr. Eady, evidently in the hope of shaking Mr. Lorimer’s determination ; but the latter replied that he adhered to his opinion of the incredibility of the explanation given by the Wilayat; that in any case the Governor- General was responsible for the acts of his subordinates; and that he wished to discuss the subject personally with His Excellency. Simultaneously the notice to Messrs. Lynch s manager was withdrawn by means of an official letter from the President of the Municipality, in which a mistake was alleged and regret was expressed. In the evening M^r. Lorimer received an official letter, signed by the Governo-General, refusing the inter view which he had claimed, on the technical ground that the question was one of immovable property, repeating that the notice had been6 issued “ through an error, a misunderstanding,” and taking exception to the terms t of Mr. Lorimer’s protest. Mr. Lorimer has taken steps to ensure that no incorrect versions of the affair are circulated at Baghdad by the Wilayat officials •without being immediately contradicted on his authority. (ii) [ Vide 'paragraph 7{Hi) of the Memo- randum Jor January 1911.} It appears that the ease brought against Mr. Jajju for illicit dealing in antiquities has broken down, and that Mr. Webber has appointed Mr. Jajju and a professional lawyer to bring a suit in his name against the authorities responsible for breaking into his room in Mr. Jajju’s house. Mr. Lorimer has been informed that Badri Bey, the Antiquities Inspector who instigated the search, himself traffics in antiquities, and that his action against Mr. Jajju was taken with the object of crushing a rival in the trade. 8. On the 3rd January, at an official British official mat- visit which he paid ter8, # to Mr. Lorimer, Eram Bey hinted that important political changes at Constantinople might be looked for shortly. He indicated that the accession of Nazim Pasha to great power in the capital was a possibility, and he added that such an event would he very favourable to British interests throughout the Turkish Empire. 9. (Vide paragraph 8 of the Memo- Steam Navigation on randuYU for January * h h e T lgri8 and Eu- 19 U,) Mr. Lorimer P ' . reports that lately some of the Turkish steamers have brought up two cargo barges each from Basrah instead of one, and that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company s agents are desirous of adopting the same procedure ; but at the present time either to claim this as a right or to request it as a favour of the Baghdad °Local Government would be difficult; and no steps have been taken in this direction. The accumulation of cargo in the Company’s hands at Basrah during the past month has varied from about 3,300 to 3,700 tons. It has been due mainly to a phenomenal boom in the import trade of Persia rid Baghdad, but this is now slackening, and Mr. Parry estimates that the accumulation can be worked off with single barges in from two to three months. (ii) Mr. Lorimer reports that Abdul Qadir Pasha and one Saiyid Jafar have ob tained a river navigation concession for two steamers and six barges. Ihe Irade has actually arrived from Constantinople, and efforts are being made by the con cession naires to raise a capital of £T. 50,000 in £T 10 shares. ’Abdul Qadir Pasha is said to be no longer the wealthy man that he once was and7 his money is mostly sunk in landed property. It remains to be seen whether private investors will step into the breach. Mr. Lorimer very much doubts whether they will, rights and property being as insecure as they are under the present regime. 10 . (Vide paragraph 10 of the Memo- • xr raridum for January 1911.) It is reported that the Imam’s Lieutenants are active all over the Yemen and skirmishes are of frequent occurrence. Some Zaidi Sherifs and adherents of the Imam, who came to see the Political Resident from A1 Jouf, told him that the Imam does not wish temporal autonomy in the Yemen, but merely to be left alone to exercise his spiritual sway. He has great respect for the Sultan Muhammad Y, but fights to check the excesses of Turkish officials who are the real opponents of Islam. News has also been received that the Gov ernor-General of Yemen, who attacked and destroyed a place called Ar*Rowdtha in the vicinity of Sanaa which was occupied by the Imam’s forces, was nearly captured by the Arabs, but succeded in re-entering Sanaa through the timely arrival of a reinforcement from that garrison. Several skirmishes are also reported in different quarters and Yemen is in a state of great unrest. Communication between Hodeida and Sanaa and Sanaa and Taiz is completely interrupted and large numbers of Turkish troops have been despatched to Hodeida during the month. The Imam’s soldiers are reported to have seized Nadara, 50 miles to the north of Kataba, the garrison of which is moving to Taiz. It is rumoured that Saiyid Muhammad Idris of Sabia has disappeared, and it is sus pected that he has gone to live with the Imam. The tribes under the influence of Muhammad Idris are reported to have practically isolated the Turkish forces at Ibha in A ssyr. Sherif Husen Muhammad, one of the Imam’s emissaries, came into Aden with a letter of introduction from the^ Abdali Sultan. He was interviewed by Major Jacob. He said that the Turks had no right to rule in Yemen With regard to the present struggle in Yemen, he felt sure that the Turks would fail in their attempt to conquer the Imam. He went on to say that the Imam was well disposed towards the British Government on account of their just and fair dealings with their allies and subjects m Aden. _ He hinted that the Imam was willing to enter into friendly relations with the British Government. He was told we maintain a strict neutrality.11. The Political Resident at Aden Relations between the re P ort , s Imam and the Abdali ago the Abdall oultan the Imam to purchase a minting apparatus, which he did, and its arrival at Dthala is now reported by the Amir of Dthala. It is said that the Turks are intent on waylaying the caravan and confiscating the machine. The Political Resident has told the Ahdali Sultan that his action in this respect is apt to he con strued by the Turks as emanating from the British Government, whose policy is one of neutrality, and that it will he best for him to recall the caravan and send it later through the territories of neutral Chiefs. The Ahdali Sultan has accepted this advice. (Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf.) 12. ( Vide paragraphs 16 and 17 of Memo^ randum for January Proposed compre* 1911.} In their letter, out that it was unlikely that in its present disposition the Turkish Government would approach, in a reasonable spirit, negotiations such as suggested by the India Office, and, as His Majesty’s Government w^ould have diffi culty in finding a quid pro quo, the Turks would not make the concessions proposed by Colonel Cox (vide paragraph lo of Memo randum for November 1910). Therefore, in view of the certainty of the proposed negotia tions ending in failure, and of the serious steps which His Majesty’s Government might be forced to take in consequence, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for foreign Affairs depre cated, for the present, any discussion with the Turkish Government as to affairs of the Persian Gulf unless the Turks themselves opened it. The best moment for such nego tiations would come when the Turkish Gov ernment next sought the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the 4 per cent, increase of customs duties; it would then be necessary to discuss the question of Kuwait in connection with the Baghdad Railway, and, by using the customs increase as a lever, it might be possible to obtain a satis factory arrangement about Kuwait and other places also in the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government could withhold their consent to the increase of customs duties until these points have been secured, and if a breach with Turkey must come, it w^ould be better that it should come on this ground rather than on the grounds of the proposed negotiations in re gard to Persian Gulf questions only. As to removing by force signs of Turkish authority from places where their rights were Sultan. was commissioned by 1911, His Majesty’s Foreign Office pointed9 not admitted, it should first be considered how the Turks could be prevented from replacing them once they had been removed. There would be no difficulty in the case of an island, but it would be useless expelling a small Turkish force on the mainland from a place which the Turks could reoccupy with a larger force subsequently. Such action might lead to a situation of which the only solution would be a war with Turkey, and the question should be considered as to what should be done in such a case, and what complications in Egypt or India might be involved thereby. In any case it would not be safe to press matters so far, until the naval and military authorities were known to be agreed upon some plan of campaign and pre pared to carry it out in the last resort. For these reasons His Majesty’s Foreign Office, while appreciating the inconvenience of the present unsettled and undefined state of affairs, considered that, unless extreme provo cation was forthcoming, it would be better to wait the renewal this year by the Turks of their request for the increase of customs dues, and then to open the question of all the points in dispute, and to endeavour to secure a reasonable settlement. The India Office recognise that circumstances are not so favour able now for approaching the Turkish Govern ment as in October last, when His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to make a communication to the Porte {vide para graph 13 of Memorandum for November 1910), and have agreed to the postponement of the proposed communication to Turkey, assuming that the latter will at no very distant date approach His Majesty’s Government on the question of the proposed increase of the customs duties, but they have strongly urged, in view of the present situation, that the question of the action to be taken in certain eventua lities, both generally and locally in the Persian Gulf, should at the earliest possible date he considered and decided, either in the Com mittee of Imperial Defence or otherwise, in order that the Government of India may know what, if anything, is expected of them, and also that the diplomacy of His Majesty’s Government may not be hindered when a decisive opportunity is offered. 13. {Vide paragraph li of Memoran dum for January 1911.) Proposod settlement rp^g proposals of His of the Kuwait question ^ ^ in connection with the Majesty’s Government Baghdad Baiiway. as regards the settle ment of the Kuwait question were communi cated to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with instructions to telegraph his views. Colonel Cox happened to be about to proceed to Kuwait and was authorised by the Govern ment of India discreetly to elicit the views of10 Shaikh Muharak without disclosing the motive. He telegraphed, on the 10th February, after seeing the Shaikh, that Turkish suzer- eignty over Kuwait might he accorded on condition that (a) a definite undertaking should be given by the Porte that Kuw r ait shall he the terminus of the railway, as otherwise, after we had admitted Turkish suzereignty over Kuwait, the terminus might he fixed elsewhere, (b) Um Kasr, Bubiyan and Warba should be recognized as within the Shaikh’s control and the present Turkish guardianship of the places shoe Id be removed, (&lt;?) the effective control of the Kuwait port, on shore as well as afloat, should be in British bands, (d) our engagements with the Shaikh should hold good, and that (e) the Porte should gire a written promise that they wmuld not interfere in Kuwait affairs,—an undertaking which they had already been offering to the Shaikh in connection with the latter’s Fadaghia property, on condition that the Chief’s sons registered themselves as Turkish subjects. Colonel Cox was strongly opposed to the suggestion that the Shaikh should pay tribute to Turkey, which the Shaikh had never paid, and which would be greatly resented by him, and give the worst possible impression among other Arab Shaikhs in their relations with us. Colonel Cox pro posed that, instead of Shaikh Mubarak pay ing tribute, the port revenues of Kuwait might be divided between the Shaikh and the Turkish Government, to make good the loss to the latter which w^ould result from Kuwait, instead of Basrah, being the terminus of the railway. Later, while the Government of India were considering the proposals, another telegram (dated 16th February) was received from His Majesty’s Secretary of State intimat ing that the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had indicated a scheme by which the Gulf section of the Baghdad Bail way, while being an Ottoman line, should be inter nationalized and Britain, France, Germany, and perhaps Turkey also, should be joint shareholders. The Government of India telegraphed, on the 23rd February, repeating Colonel Cox’s views, and pointing out that the proposals made by His Majesty’s Government indicated a change of policy. The Govern ment of India strongly recommended that there should be no surrender of our position until ( 1 ) we secure predominant control in the Baghdad-Kuwait section of the railway—at least 60 per cent of the capital and control, and ( 2 ) we share with the Shaikh the absolute control of Kuwait harbour and port, ashore and afloat. It was also urged as a sine qva non that, before concluding the suzerainty negouations with the Turks, a specific assurance should be secured from the latter * *111 that Kuwait shall be the terminus of the railway. The Government of India generally supported Colonel Cox’s recommendations, if the above essential conditions could be secured. 14. {Fide paragraph 14 of Memorandum Threatened attack on f or Kuwait by the Muntaflk. aua the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf.) The Political Agent at Kuwait reported on the 18th January that Shaikh Sadoon Pasha of the Muntafik was seriously contem plating an expedition, which included a possible attack on Kuwait town, and that one of Sadoon Pasha’s near relatives had sounded him as to whether His Majesty’s Gov ernment would assist the Shaikh in repelling an attack by the Muntafik on Jahara or Kuwait, even if Sadoon guaranteed that no harm would result to the British represent ative or British life and property. Shaikh Mubarak believed that this sudden revival of hostilities and the aggressive attitude of Sadoon Pasha were due to Turkish intrigues. The Yali of Basrah had written to the Shaikh, offering to settle the dispute between him and Sadoon Pasha in consultation with the representatives of the parties, and the Shaikh had replied, giving a history of the matter, complaining that Sadoon Pasha had arrived within Kuwait territory, and asking the Yali to force him to withdraw. In view, however, of the suspected complicity of the Turks and the proximity of Sadoon Pasha, Shaikh Mubarak was anxious to secure British assistance. He called on the Political Agent and asked that Colonel Cox might be communicated with and requested to send, if possible, one of His Majesty’s ships to remain in Kuwait harbour for a short time. The request was supported by the Political Agent, and Colonel Cox, guided by the precedent of 1901, when Kuwait apprehended an attack by Bin Bashid, arranged to send H.M.S. “Philomel” m order that he might be kept in wireless touch with developments at Kuwait and that the presence of His Majesty’s ship might help to influence the situation in the direction of peace. On the 28th January, the Political Agent telegraphed that Sadoon had written for peace, to which Shaikh Mubarak was agree able on the condition that two of the Dhafir Shaikhs should come in, that Sadoon was still near Safwan, and though an attack was now improbable, the chances of a peaceful solution would be improved by the gunboat remaining a week longer. He was informed on the *9! h that the gunboat could remain at Kuwait ior the present. 15. {Vide paragraph 10 of the Memo randum for hecember Proposed enquiry into iqi()\ rm lfl Govern- the causes of tbe deple- lUlU.) ine UOVeiU tion of the pearl banks ment of India nave in the Persian Gulf. been advised to employMr. S.

This has been communicated to Colonel Cox, with instructions to report if he sees any objec tion to the course proposed with reference to the possible attitude of the local Arab tribes or the foreign agents in the Gulf. The Government of Madras has also been asked to obtain the views of Mr. Hornell of the Madras Fishery Department as to the causes of the depletion of the pearl banks. 16. ( Vide paragraph 11 of Memo- Question of British Z','nT f Z Arms entering into the IVIU.) The Govern- Bahrain! u 81 n 6 8 8 a * ment of India have, in their despatch to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, No. 8 (Secret-External), dated the 2 nd February 1911, supported Colonel Cox’s proposal that the Board of Trade should be authorised to sound Messrs.

(Videparagraph 12 of the Memo- Lighting and buoying randum for January Of the Persian Gulf. mL) Early in Feb ruary, the “ Palinurus ” was detailed to under take the immediate survey of the Shatt-el-Arab and to replace missing buoys. Unfortunately, she was delayed by a break-down. Mean vhile the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported (22nd February) that a lighter carrying two buoys, and towed by a Turkish launch, had arrive! at Fan from Basrah, alon-- side the Turkish gun-boat “ Marmaris ”, and that the Commander of the latter had orders to place the buoys on the inner bar. Colonel Cox r ^ ur ^ s ^ 1 Commander that two of His Majesty’s ships were on deputation for replacing the British Government buoys which had gone adrift, and that it would be a danger to navigation for him to deposit any buovs Cha ?] lel 1 ^ad been re-examined! and that it would also hinder the work of His Majesty’s ships. The Turkish Commander replied that his orders to lay buoys were categorical and left him no discretion, and that constant complaints of German ships rendered the matter urgent. The Naval Commander- in-Ghief represented that it was very undesir able that Turkey should be allowed to have anything to do with the navigation of the bar but pointed out that, even though the buovs would probably have to be placed outside the strict limits of Turkish territorial waters, iurkey, as one of the riverain Powers, couldclaim a joint right with Persia to the regular entrance to the river. The Government of India issued instructions to the Naval Corn- mao der—in-Chief to press on with the survey, to lay down the British buoys without regard to the Turkish buoys, to prevent any inter ference with existing British buoys, hut not to remove the Turkish buoys when placed, as the British Government have no right to take such a step. His Majesty’s ship “ Odin ** arrived on the spot on the 24th Pebruary and commenced the survey, pending the arrival of the “ Palinurus ”, which left Karachi for the Shatt-el-Arab on the 25th idem. The Secre tary of State was informed of the action taken by the Government of India in the matter. On the 28th February, Colonel Cox reported that, according to a report from His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, the Turks had completed a third buoy, which would probably soon be sent to the bar with an iron barge and light now in preparation, and that they had laid two buoys on the bar. 18. {Vide paragraph 13 of the Memo* •n randum for January Proposed lighted buoy ^ at the outer bar of the 1911-) The gas buoy Shatt-el-Arab. re ported to be on board the S.

The Govern ment of India decided that it was undesirable to make an offer, at present, to the Sultan for the farm of the Maskat Customs, and informed the Secretary of State and the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf accordingly. 20. {Vide paragraph 15 of the Memo- „ . . randum for December Seizure of a Maskat ' c dhow by Italian autho- 1910.) The Govern- rities at Hafun. ment of India informed the Secretary of State that they agreed to pay half the compensation of 5,000 dollars, and enquired whether, in the event of the Nakhoda, when found, agreeing to sign the declaration, the terms proposed might be formally offered to him. The Secretary of State, however, proposed to await the Italian Government’s reply. In February, the Secretary of State intimated that the Italian Government had accepted the compromise, the precise terms of which were :— First.—That the Italian Government would release the dhow after obtaining from the Nakhoda a written declaration recognising the legality of the measures taken by the Italian authorities.MRi ( f ¥[ I i r i n Secondly. —That the Italian Government would restore to the Nakhoda, after obtaining the said declaration, 1,000 dollars in the dhow’s cash-box, and would hand over to the rightful owners 500 sacks of lime and the non-perishable goods found on board. Thirdly. —That His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Italian Government each would hand over 2,500 dollars to the Sultan of Maskat, in order that he might take direct steps for the payment of the compensation, thus annulling all and every result of seizure. The Italian Government instructed the local authorities accordingly, the Consul- General at Aden being empowered to pay the Italian contribution. The Secretary of State desired that the Political Agent, Maskat, should he instructed, so that the terms of the compromise might he communicated to the Nakhoda by the Sultan. The Italian Gov ernment preferred that payment should be made through the Sultan, as strengthening his position. The Government of India were also authorised to pay, at their discretion, up to Rs. 1,500, on account of travelling expenses. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed to act accordingly, and the Poli tical Resident. at Aden was asked to inform the Political Agent, Maskat, direct, if the Nakhoda arrived at Aden, and to request the latter to remain, pending a communication from Maskat. u - The Political Resident subsequently reported that the Sultan would take the neces sary action as soon as the Nakhoda’s where abouts was known, and that the Sultan was enquiring if there was any news of the latter at Sur. The Political Resident added that it would he necessary to increase the amount allotted for travelling expenses, if the Nakhoda was not caught at Aden, and if it should be necessary to send him back for the dhow. 21 . {Vide paragraph 8 of the Memo- Proposed opening of randum for November a Post Office at Kuwait. 1910 ) His Ma; j est , g Charge d Affaires at Constantinople is of opinion that the proposal to establish a regular Eritish-Indian Post Office at Kuwait is likely to arouse strong opposition from the Ottoman Government. His Majesty’s Government therefore, consider that the proposal should’ for the present, remain in abeyance, more’ especially as the question of Kuwait may before long come under discussion with the Turkish Government. ( Vide paragraph 14 of the^ Memorandum for January 191 i). The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is being informed accordingly. 22 .

TIBET. 23. {Vide paragraph 20 of the Memo- randum for January Tibet* 11080 a0ti0Q in 1911.) On tlie 27th January, Mr. Bell com municated, in writing to the Dalai Lama, the thanks of His Majesty the King-Emperor for the Lama’s letter and presents which accom panied it, and also informed the Dalai Lama that His Majesty regretted that he was unable to interfere between the Lama and his suzerain. The Dalai Lama returned to Darjeeling from his pilgrimage on the 23rd February. The Consul-General, Chengtu, has reported that among the resolutions passed at a special session of the Ssuch’uan Provincial Assembly, was one for the selection of Commissioners to visit Tibet, and report on social and economic conditions in that country, more specially on mining matters. It was thought at first that a six months’ tour would suffice, at the cost of some Tls. 4,000 ; but a member affirmed that tfce Commission would tend to become per manent, and that an annual provision of over TTs. 10,000 would have to be made. The Commission will probably take the form of an Association, to be known as the Tibet Statistical Society (Tsangwei Tiao-ch’a Hui), and its expenses will be met by sub scription among the members, and not by subventions from public funds. Though^ its duties will comprise a study of 44 the organisa tion of Government,” no reflection is intended to be cast on the conduct of affairs by the Amban at Lhasa, Lien-yu, or his Councillor, Ch’ien Hsi-pao. The object of the Associa tion is said to be the exploitation of Tibet in the interests of the Ssuch’uan gentry. According to information received by the Consul-General' Chengtu, Chao Erh Feng has succeeded in subduing the San-ngai tribe and will now proceed against the Chantui, a larger and more noted robber tribe east of Litang. 24. {Vide paragraph 22 of the Memoran dum for January 1911.) Extension Of the te^Q- jnformation has been to chiamdo and received that the work Gyantse. j n connection with the extension of the telegraph line from Batang to Chiamdo has been commenced, and that it is intended also to connect the latter place16 with Gyantse. Sir J. N. Jordan is unaware whether any foreigners are employed on the work in Tibet, but enquiries will be made by him to ascertain the exact facts. 25. {Vide paragraph 23 of the Memo- Visit of Tashi Lama ravdum for January to Lhasa. 1911.) It has been reported that the Tashi Lama, under com pulsion by Ma Chi Ku, Chinese Trade Agent at Gyantse, left Shigatse for Lhasa on the 7th February to take up the post of Dalai Lama. 26. (Vide paragraph 21 of the Memo- _ , ,, , randum for Januaru Proposed establish- mi ei ment of postal commu- 1911.) The Secretary Tibet 0 f State was informed on the 11 th February that a recent communication received from the Inspector-General, Chinese Imperial Posts, by the Director-General of the Post Office of India, made it plain that the “ exchange ser vice” desired by China was that in respect of mails to pass between Tibet and China across India, and that it was, therefore, not necessary to address the ( hinese Government in the matter as previousl requested. The Secretary of State was, however, asked whether instruc tions might now be given to the Director- General of the Post Office of India to reply to the Inspector General of Chinese Imperial Posts that the Government of India considered that until the efficiency of the Chinese postal service in Tibet was demonstrated, the ex change of Chinese-Tibetan mails should take place at Gyantse. 27. {Vide paragraph 11 of the Memo- Lapse of the Anglo- randum for October Russian agreement to 1910.\ In accord a noo prevent scientific Mis- . . accordance sions from visiting With instructions, His Tibet ' Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh addressed to the Russian Government a note setting forth the views of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the lapse of the agreement to prevent scientific Missions from visiting Tibet, and inviting a statement of the Russian Government’s views. The Hussian Government have replied that they fully share the views of His Majesty’s Government, and see no objection to con sidering the agreement as having entirely lapsed, and they have promised to inform His Majesty’s Government of any steps which they may decide to take with regard to applications from private individuals desiring to cross into Tibet through Russian territory. The decision of the two Governments to allow the agreement to lapse was announced in the St. Petersburgh newspapers in a short paragraph which was evidently officially inspired. In reporting this His Majesty’s Ambassador mentioned that he was nevercor.sulted as to the publication of the intel ligence, nor was he informed that it would he given to the press. 28. {Vide paragraph 13 of the Memo* to him by the Government of India on the 16th September 1910, that the Tibetan Government have not violated the treaties by levying customs dues on British subjects or by placing restrictions on trade by existing routes, but that as they did not know what had been done by their officials they have called for reports from Gartok, the But^tok (Rudok) Jongpen, Daba Kar-pon, Tsa-hreng Jongpen, Pu-hreng (Purang or Taklakot) Jongpen, Barkha Tarjum and.

(Vide paragraph 24 of the Memo* Chinese interference rafidum for January in Bhutan. igu j The Maharaja of Bhutan has informed Mr. Bell that he will not receive any Chinese without first consult ing the Government of India. 30.

No active opposition was offered. 31. (Vide paragraph 27 of the Memo* Expedition to Hpimaw randum for January (Pienma.) 1911.) On the 1 st February, the Government of Burma tele graphed that a report had been received from Mr. Hertz to the effect that, on arrival at Epimaw (Pienma), he found a Chinese school master and several Chinese traders. The former was an official appointed by the Paoshan Magistrate, eight or nine months ago. Mr . 1 Hertz instructed him to close his school and return to China, and he left Hpimaw the next day for Teng Keng. Mr. Hertz subsequently advanced to Kangfang, north of Hpimaw, in order to administer the Northern tract. On reaching communication made ASSAM. Btate. reported that the Poli- BURMA.Gawlam village between Hpimaw and Kang- fang, he received information of the arrival at Teng Keng of a Chinese ying, and another at Yinpankai, which was situated to the south-east of Spare. Mr. Hertz thought that they had probably been sent to watch the frontier. The Government of Burma added that Sr. Hertz was being warned of the representation by the Chinese Government that he was in Chinese territory, and that they would not be responsible for any collision that might occur. On the 3rd February, the Government of Burma reported that Mr. Hertz had visited Kangfang on 22nd January, and reported all well. He was at Htamshing en route for Htawgaw and Spare on the 26th January. On the 6 th February, Sir J. N. Jordan communicated a report from Mr. Hose, Consul at Tengyueh, dated the 22nd January, that five hundred new troops had left Tali for Tengyueh, travelling as quickly as possible. On the 1st February, these troops had diverged from Yung Chang for Teng Keng with the Yung Chang Prefect. On the same day, another 500 left Tali for Tengyueh, whence part of the local troops had moved into the Chinese Shan States. Mr. Hose gathered that the object of these movements was defensive rather than offensive. On the 5th February, His Majesty’s Consul- General at Yunnanfu reported that the 73rd Kegiment of Regulars had left Yunnanfu, and were said to be going to Tengyueh. Sir J. Jordan’s impression was that the intention of all these movements was the strengthening of the hands of the Chinese Government in con nection with the forthcoming negotiations. On the 8 th February, the Government of Burma communicated the following inform ation which had been supplied by the Consul- General, Yunnan, and Mr. Hose :— (a) Two ying of troops had left Tali for the west, and the troops of the Governor-General had left Yunnanfu travelling westward General Tsui left on the 1 st February for Chusiungfu. The Viceroy was said to be leaving for Tali, (5) At a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce on the 4th February, it was resolved that British goods should be boycotted, and telegrams to that effect were sent to Mengtze Ssumao, Tengyueh, Tali and Chao Tuno*’ A Council was held the same evening comprising the Viceroy with four Com missioners and four Taotais, probably in connection with Hpimaw. (c) As regards the boycott Mr. Hose was assured by all representative merchants that the instructions would be disregarded, as its enforcement would ruin the mercantile com munity.19 The Government of Burma also mentioned that Mr. Hertz had reported on the 5th Feb ruary from Macgpawt, near Htawgaw, that a Chinese ofiBcer with two soldiers had been spying at Lagwi, a short distance east of If pare. At Mr. Hertz’s request, the half battalion of Native Infantry stationed at Nangu was being advanced to Htawgaw, and arrangements were being made to mobilise one double company of the half battalion at Myitkyina, so as to he ready to advance in case of necessity to Nangu. On the 8 th February, the Secretary of State telegraphed that the Government of India would doubtless consider whether it was not advisable for M**. Hertz to remain in the neighbourhood of the frontier, until the situa tion had further developed and the intentions of the Chinese were clear, as it was obviously undesirable that the Chinese should step in as soon as Mr. Hertz’s back was turned. En quiry was made at the same time as to what had been decided about the location of police posts. On the 10th February, the Secretary of State was informed, after consultation with the Government of Burma, that Mr. Hertz having reported that Makawng would he unsuitable for a post, the Government of India had authorised the establishment of a police post at Wanghte, 12 miles north of Makawng, on the river, a few miles east of Nangu, and 40 miles by road from Seniku, subject to the assurance that the post could he main tained in the rainy season. With reference to the question of the administration of the country to the east of the Winmaw range, Mr. Hertz had reported that the villages on the Ngaw- chaung river, though they feared the Chinese, were friendly and would give no trouble. The Kangfang and Hpimaw groups of villages would require supervision, as some authority had been exercised in the past over these villages in a spas modic way by the Teng Keng Chief. Mr. Hertz considered that Hpimaw and Kangfang should be frequently visited by a civil officer, and for this purpose it was proposed to provide 30 mounted infantry with mules at the Wanghte post, and construct a mule track from Wanghte to Htawgaw on the Ngawchaung river, across the Winmaw range. It was also mentioned that it would be necessary to keep open this track throughout the year, and that two permanent bridges and a ferry would he required and that the Lieutenant-Governor was prepared to attempt the administration of the whole area from Wanghte post. It was added that an estimate of the cost had been called for, and that the Government of India had agreed to Mr. Hertz at once improving the tract between Htawgaw and Hpimaw with the means already at his disposal.20 On the 10th February, the Government of Burma reported that Mr. Hertz, while at Hpare, had received information that Hpimaw had been occupied by 300 Chinese troops. The latest information regarding the Chinese troops, the Government of Burma said, rendered it probable that the 500 modern troops, which were diverted at Yungchang, had reached Hpimaw, and it was possible that the second 500 troops, who were said to have left Tali for Tengyueh on the 1st February, might also be at Hpimaw. The Lieu tenant-Governor had telegraphed to Mr. Hertz to return to Htawgaw, and there await the arrival of the half battalion of 89th Punjabis, who were advancing from Nangu and should reach Htawgaw in about four days. It was stated that on the arrival of the half battalion at Htawgaw, Mr. Hertz would have 450 Military Police, and about 400 Native Infantry with two maxim guns. Meanwhile, Mr. Hertz would halt at Htawgaw, pending further orders, and get all information possible about the position at Hpimaw. The question was whether the combined column should return to Hpimaw and expel the Chinese, if necessary by force, should the Officer Com manding think that this was practicable. The situation was serious, as both sides would be employing regular troops, but the Lieutenant- Governor was of opinion that the column should return to Hpimaw, if the Commanding Officer considered it practicable, and expel the Chinese by force, if necessary. It was added that instructions had been sent for the advance to Nangu of a double company of the half battalion at Myitkyina. On the 11 th February, the Government of Burma were informed that Mr. Hertz should he instructed to remain at Htaw^gaw until further orders, and that without ins tructions from the Government of India no advance w r as to be made to Hpimaw. In informing the Secretary of State of this, the Government of India mentioned that they were of opinion that Mr. Hertz should remain on the defensive, as, except with an overwhelming force which would place the issue beyond doubt, it did not appear desirable to provoke a conflict with the Chinese. Such a force, however, was not available, and there appeared to be some doubt as to what the strength of Chinese troops at Hpimaw was. On the 12 th February, the Govern ment of Burma reported that Mr. Bose, who was asked if he could verify the report that Hpimaw had been occupied by 300 Chinese troops, had replied that, as far as he could ascertain, the Tengyueh autho rities had no definite knowledge that any Chinese had arrived at Hpimaw, though a21 military official informed him that a message was received to the effect that the British troops had evacuated the disputed area. Mr. Rose stated that he had also learnt that Prefect Chiaug had received instructions to occupy Hpimaw, if possible, hut not to risk hostilities. Mr. Bose also mentioned that he had taken a definite stand, and that the situation was unusually favourable, all Chinese opposition having suddenly collapsed. The Taotai had arranged a se tlement of all questions and cases pending between them, pro mised to sign maps and regulations in frontier cultivation questions (vide paragraph 29 of the Memorandum for January 1911), to pay immediately outstanding compensation, to seal deeds of Consulate site, and officially to pro hibit boycott; this agreement being subject only to ratification by the Viceroy. If confirma tion of the information sent by Mr. Hertz was received, Mr. Bose said he would strongly urge the desirability of inducing the Chinese to eva cuate Hpimaw, which in their view was more important than the line or frontier. In his opinion the whole British position, and the possibility of a satisfactory settlement of the entire frontier which now appeared to be in sight, would be seriously prejudiced by conti nued Chinese occupation. On the 14th February, the Government of Burma communicated the following inform ation which had been furnished by the Consul- General, Yunnan :—(o) The Administrator of Foreign Affairs stated that the troops from Tali were going to Yungchangfu city in order to reassure the inhabitants. In the Consul- GeneraFs opinion, it w as more likely that the troops were going to what China considered the frontier. ( 6 ) In the Administrator’s Office there was a Chinese map on which the whole of the N’Maikha Valley above about the 26th degree of latitude was marked Tibet. (c) It was also reported that the Director of the Military School had left about the 28th Janu ary, with nine students, with the object of surveying the Yunnan and Burma frontier, presumably, where it was undelimited. On the same day, His Majesty’s Govern ment informed Sir J. Jordan that it would apparently require a big expedition to turn the Chinese out of Hpimaw, and that this would be very costly, and might develop into a complete state of war with China. The local issues involved did not justify such great expenditure and the risk to British trade in China, nor did the British local case seem to be impregnable on the merits. More over, more evidence of Chinese administration in the disputed district seemed to have been found by Mr. Hertz’s expedition than was anticipated. An amicable settlement, which would secure the withdrawal of the Chinese»• 22 troops from Hpimaw, would, therefore, he preferable, and on this condition His Majesty’s Government would he prepared to respond by withdrawing their troops from certain places to be agreed to with China. Both sides would then abstain from further occu pation, pending discussion with China as to a joint delimitation commission. Sir J. Jordan was accordingly asked to telegraph his view as to making this as a conciliatory proposal to China to avoid a conflict. The Government of India were also asked for their observations and suggestions with special reference to the proposal for joint delimitation. On the 15th February, the Secretary of State was informed that the Government of India entirely approved of the proposed com munication to China, and that they considered that, if the Chinese troops were withdrawn from Hpimaw, the British Government could well agree to the withdrawal of their own from Htawgaw to Wanghte. It was also stated that the whole country was not worth the danger and expense of a serious conflict. The Government of India ^ added that when the question of delimitation came under discussion, it would not be absolutely necessary to adhere to the watershed as the frontier, provided that another frontier line was adopted which would be easily recognisable by the population on both sides, and which would not present an opening for future discussion. On the 14th February, Sir J. N. Jordan telegraphed that he had received a note from the Wai-wu-pu stating that the question of the frontier line had for many years been in dispute, and that the map of the frontier made by Shih and Mr. Litton could not be accepted as a proof of agreement on this point. The Chinese Government had never assented to the watershed indicated by Sir E. Satow, which was an ex parte pronouncement. In default of a clearly marked boundary, there was no means of arriving at a definite con clusion, except by the appointment of officers to make a fresh delimitation, and the Wai-wu- pu had repeatedly asked that this should be done. As regards Hpimaw, native villages subject to the Teng Keng Chief, the Chinese Government considered that Mr. Litton’s ori ginal proposal for a lease in perpetuity, on the precedent of the Meng Mao triangle, was a clear recognition of the over-lordship ’of the Chinese. There were records dating back from the Taokuang period proving the payment of taxes and duties, and the tribes to this day brought their complaints to the District Magis trate at Paoshan. The offer, which had been repeatedly made by His Majesty’s Legation to pay compensation for presents and dues hitherto received from native headmen, was re garded by the Wai-wu-pu as a further un- I ■ 1 y—^£r*^, ..., _ 23 doubted proof that these villages were subject to China. Moreover, the villages of Tsu, Chu, and Spare had for a very long time been ruled by two Fuyi (Chiefs) Yang Tso of Ming K.wang, and certificates of hereditary rank which had been issued to them by the Board of War in the Taokuang period still existed. The Wai-wu-pu’s note concluded with the remark that Bis Majesty’s Government could not fail to appreciate these clear and conclusive proofs, and that w hatever might be the eventual deci sion as to the frontier, it was essential that the troops should be first withdrawn before any negotiations for a satisfactory settlement could take place. Sir J. Jordan was of opinion that negotia tions for the withdrawal of the troops by both Powers might lead to a settlement, but not to a full concession of the British demands, and that it would now probably be impossible to attain the latter by anything short of the forcible ejection of the Chinese from Hpimaw. He also considered that monetary compensation in lieu of dues from the villages mentioned in the Wai-wm-pu’s note was very unlikely to satisfy the Chinese, and he was of opinion that, if experience of the Meng Mao precedent showed there were objections to Mr. Litton’s proposal of a perpetual lease, the British Government should be prepared to make some other offer for the surrender of these rights. Finally Sir J. N. Jordan enquired whether it would be feasible to offer territorial compensation on the frontier further north. The Government of Burma were asked to furnish their views. On the 14th February, the Secretary of State approved the action taken by the Government of India as reported in their tele gram of the 10th February, and stated that he was aw r aiting the views of the Government of India regarding the administration of the whole area together with estimates. On the 15th February, the Government of Burma reported that Mr. Bose, who had been asked if the 600 Chinese troops which left Tali on the 1 st February, had arrived at Tengyueh or had been diverted, replied that the Chamber of Commerce had assured him that the troops referred to would reach Tengyueh shortly and that the Yung-Chang Prefect was on bis way to the disaffected district in the interior. On the same day, Mr. Bose telegraphed that the first party of 600 troops had returned to Yungchang-fu, and that the second party of 630 had arrived at Tengyueh. Mr. Bose added that it seemed probable, therefore, that there were no new troops at Hpimaw. The Government of Burma mentioned that definite information had not yet been received from Mr. Hertz as to what troops were there.24 On the 16th February, Sir J. N. Jordan telegraphed that if, as seemed evident, Hpimaw had been evacuated by the Chinese, the British position would be immensely strengthened in negotiating a final settlement of the frontier question, if Mr. Hertz re-occupied the place. At any rate, Mr. Hertz should, SirJ. Jordan thought, remain in the immediate neighbour hood of Hpimavv until the Chinese consented to negotiate. The Chinese Government had already expressed their willingness to negotiate a basis for a frontier before proceeding to delimitation, and if they would come to a reasonable understanding on this point, Sir J. N. Jordan though that the British Government might offer to withdraw their troops. In a later message from Sir J. Jordan it was stated that all information reaching him from fairly reliable sources tended to show that the Chinese Government had no serious intention of risking a collision on the frontier, and that they were trusting to obtain a settle ment of the question by diplomatic negotia tions. About the same time, Mr. Bose reported that the laotai informed him tha . the Viceroy had unreservedly accepted his agreement, and had expressed an earnest desire for an amicable and speedy settlement of the whole frontier question. The Taotai had taken immediate steps to carry out bis obligations in a spirit of loyalty, and his attitude appeared signific ant, after the persistent hostility of the past year. As the British p( sition was unusually strong, Mr. Bose was of opinion that a favourable* opportunity had occurred for pressing for a final settlement of the entire frontier line. The following points, which appeared most important from the local point of view, were presented for the consideration of the Govern ment of India : ( 1 ) that the British Govern ment agree to the Chinese request for the joint inspection of, and addition of the Chinese inscriptions to, boundary pillars (vide paragraph k ,8 of the Memorandum for Decem ber 1910), provided that the eniire frontier line between Yunnan and Burma was first accepted by Chinese Government, includin 0 * that section to the east of the Wa country generally known as Scott’s line, and that north of Manangpum following the Irrawady- Salween divide approximately as far as latitude 28 ; (2) that China will sign the draft agree ment attached to Mr. Litton’s report, dated the 20 th May 1905 ; (3) that China appoint com petent survey officers or that they agree to accept the evidence of British officers as con clusive ; (4) that the party erect pillars as they proceed along unmarked sections; ( 5 ) that Taotai Shih Hung Shao be immediately recall ed to office; ( 6 ) that Lisanpao be released (vide paragraph 32 infra ); (7) that the25 British Government agree to cede such terri tory, if any, west of Scott’s line as may have been brought under effective Chinese adminis tration since the Boundary Commission. On the 16th February, Sir J. N. Jordan was instructed to inform the Wai-wu-pu that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to open negotiations for settling the basis of a joint delimitation. It was added that, in view of the surprising uncertainty of the move ments of the Chinese troops, it was conceivable that Mr. Hertz’s arrival at Pienma might be anticipated by, or coincide with, the re-occupa tion of the place by some Chinese force, and that it was therefore undesirable that Mr. Hertz should return to Hpimaw, but that he would be instructed not to move further from his present position, which was fairly in reach of Pienma. Instructions were issued accordinsdv to Mr. Hertz. * With reference to Sir J. Jordan’s telegram of the 14th February, the Secretary of State asked the Government of India to ‘telegraph any suggestions for a reply to the Wai-wu-pu, and enquired whether there was sufficient information on which to base proposals for the grant of territorial compensation further north that would fulfil the conditions postu lated in the communication from the Govern ment of India of the 16th February, as to a compromise in the Hpimaw region. The Secretary of State suggested that perhaps a compromise on the Namting-Mawt section might be tried. On the 17th February, the Secretary of State was informed that the detailed road survey had not yet been made of the track from Seniku to Wanghte and Htawgaw, and that it was impossible to make any accurate estimate of the cost at present. It was conjectured, however, by the Government of Burma that the cost, including bridges and ferry, would not be less than Ks. 3,30,000. Only a rough mule- track was necessary for immediate necessities and this could be constructed by the Burma Company of Sappers, assisted by imported labour before the rains. Mr. Hertz was being consulted regarding the strength of the proposed post at Wanghte. The cost of maintenance and initial cost of the post were not likely to exceed the figures for the post which it was originally intended to establish at Htawgaw, viz., Bs. 4,398 monthly cost, and Us. 20,000 initial. It was also stated that as soon as more reliable figures were obtained, a further report regarding the cost of the road and the post would be made, and that the Government of Burma considered that the post at Wanghte could be maintained in the rainy season as soon as the rough track between Seniku and Wanghte was completed.i 7 26 On the 19th February, the Government of India, after consulting the Government of Burma, stated that they did not possess sufficient information on which to base proposals for the grant of territorial compensation further north that would fulfil the conditions postulated in their communication of the 15th February. Moreover, the offer of any territorial compen sation to the west of the watershed and north of latitude 16 degrees 15 minutes was depre cated by the Burma Government. Adverting to the information furnished by Mr. Bose, the Lieutenant-Governor thought that the attitude of the Chinese at Tengyueh indicated that the present was a favourable opportunity for obtaining a settlement, but His Honour did not believe negotiations would be assisted by either reopening the question of the position of boundary pillars, or by repeating the offer of Scott’s line east of the Wa country, though he could have no objection to the acceptance of that line. The draft Con vention attached to Mr. Litton’s report was, it was explained, merely a description of the watershed, with an agreement that compens ation should be paid by the British for the ex tinction of Chinese claims to dues from the villages on the Burma side. In view of the information furnished by Mr. Hertz, the Lieutenant-Governor was prepared to admit Chinese claims to the Kangfang and Hpimaw groups of villages, if this would effect an amicable settlement. He also considered that the Chinese were unlikely to press their claim to Htawgaw or other villages in the disputed area, and urged a basis of negotiation in which the watershed would be regarded as the general boundary, and that a joint commission should be appointed which should have power to rectify it by including on the Chinese side of the frontier tracts adjacent to the watershed over which it was shown that the Chinese had exercised effective control in the past. The Lieutenant-Governor deprecated any line of general boundary west of the watershed, as this would he a surrender of the position the British Government had all along taken up, and would lead to infinite trouble in the future. He saw no objection to leasing from China any territory on the British side of the water shed over which it was shown they had exercised effective control. In communicating these views of the Government of Burma, the Government of India stated that they would concur generally in them, if the Chinese Government were willing to accept the water shed as the basis of negotiation. It was added that, should it be possible to arrange a settle ment by recognising the Chinese claims to Kangfang and Hpimaw villages, the question of further compensation did not arise, but, that shojald it be necessary hereafter to offer com pensation, the Government of India saw no f'r27 objection primd facie to compensation on the Namting-Nalawt Section. As to this, the opinion of the Burma Government was awaited. On the ISth February, Sir J. N. Jordan telegraphed that he had seen Natung, and had informed him that His Majesty’s Gov ernment were ready to open negotiations. Sir J. Jordan told Natung it would he quite useless to repeat the experiment of 1905, and proceed to a delimitation until a basis had been agreed upon, and he suggested that the watershed should he accepted as such a basis for the entire length of the frontier, on the understanding that all Chinese claims to the west would be equitably considered and duly compensated, either by a money payment or, if possible, by territorial adjustment on some other part of the frontier line. Natung demurred to the proposed basis, repeating the old arguments in support of Hsiachiang frontier, and insisted that, as a preliminary to negotiations, troops should be withdrawn. Sir J. Jordan declined to consider the question of the withdrawal until the basis for a frontier had been settled, and Natung finally agreed to the proposal, and said that he would give an answer later. In Sir J. Jordan’s opinion, it was absolutely necessary that, if any settlement was to be effected at^ Peking, Mr. Hertz should not move from his present position. On the 20th February, the Government of Burma were informed that, in the event of instructions being given for the expulsion of the Chinese troops from Hpimaw by force, or of a collision occurring between the Chinese troops and the British forces, the Government of India desired that the entire control of the operations, both military and political, should be handed over to the senior military officer of the combined force, who would act under direct instructions from the Government of India and the Commander-in-Chief. Mr. Hertz would remain as Political Officer under the Military Officer in Command. It was requested that instructions be sent to Mr. Hertz accordingly. On the 20th February, the Government of Burma reported that, according to trust worthy information received by Mr. Hertz, there were no Chinese troops at Hpimaw and that they were convinced that the return of Mr Hertz to Hpimaw would not entail any collision with the Chinese forces They accordingly advised that Mr. Hertz should be directed to go back at^ once and stay at Hpimaw pending negotiations. On the 21st February, the Gov ernment of Burma communicated a report from Mr. Hertz that the headmen of Hpimaw who had arrived at his camp stated that there were no Chinese at Hpimaw, and that the only Chinese who had been there were servants ofthe Teng Keng Fuyi, who called in the elders to Teng Keng, and made them sign a petition that they preferred to be under Chinese rather than British rule. There could, therefore, in the opinion of the Lieutenant-Governor, be no objection to Mr. Hertz’s return to Hpimaw. If he was directed to return there, it was presumed that orders in respect of making over the entire control to the Senior Military Officer did not immediately apply. The Lieutenant-Governor contemplated that Mr. Hertz should return to Hpimaw with only his Military Police escort, the military support being left at Htawgaw, and he anticipated that there would be insuperable difficulties as regards transport and rations, it the combined force were directed to occupy Hpimaw for an indefinite period. un tne zzna a cuiudry, tne secretary of informed that the Government China would State was of Burma considered that, if v,mu&lt;* wouia waive all claim to the territory west of the watershed on the northern frontier, a compro mise might be offered on the Namting-Nalawt section, on the terms proposed in the Govern- °f f^odia’s telegram, dated 22nd March 1907 (vtde paragraph 145 of the Memorandum for August 1907), to the Secretary of State.

We agree with Colonel Cox that the connection of European experts with this local trade is not without certain disadvantages. But as we are not in a position to prevent the agents of European firms from buying pearls in the local market, it seems regrettable that some British firm, possessing the necessary qualifications, should not enter the lists and share in the profits, which, as will be seen from the Trade Report of the Bahrain Islands for 1909-10, are large. We, therefore, support Colonel Cox’s suggestion that the Board of Trade he authorised to sound Messrs. Streeter &amp; Co. of Bond Street, or other firm of similar standing, with a view to ascertaining whether they are disposed to send an expert representative to take part in the business. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, As fc (L^in the No. 322-3, dated Bushire, the 4th (received 13th) December 1910 (Confidential).

I have the honour to invite reference to the Bahrain Trade Deport for 1909-1910 in which, when on the subject of the pearl trade, Captain Mackenzie refers to Mr. Rosenthal’s apparently successful enterprise in pearl-buying on the spot and regrets that no British Eirm has entered the lists. 2. I first thought of addressing the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade in the latter connection, hut in view of the past record on this subject, it would seem better for any suggestion in the direction above mentioned to go through the Government of India. 8 I cannot say I altogether welcome the advent of these European experts in the local market as the development is one which will not only fprul in itself to disturb the time-honoured usages of the industry, hut the European?who comeand find they can buy successfully will inevitably be tempted by the experience gained, to make a further advance and * , e “ owAoats or will attempt to get concessions, and become a source of difficulty to us * hut as it is presumably impossible to prevent the Agen so o^eign Firms from summering in the Gulf in order to buy pear s on the spot, it would seemlmportant for us to find some well-qualified British Firms prepared to enter into competition with them. , . . /t But nearling is a highly specialised branch of Commerce for which the • J vp 'iw ex™! knowledge, plenty of capital, courage and a free hand S is°essential, and these qualifications none of our old-established tradi ^| n nd ir, flip Gnlf sufficientlv possess. I therefore suggest that it would he firi n S if the Board of Trade could be authorised to sound such Eirms as Messrs.

In doinsr so however, I would respectfully recall the Government of India’s despatch No. 62 (Secret-External), dated 2nd June 1890, to H Majesty’s Secretary of State, and connected correspondence. s.

Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Besident in the • Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of the Government of w ^ t ^ India, a copy of an interesting communi- No. 763, dated 12 th November 1910. 1 ^ ^ , i i?. t&gt; r-f-,* l cation addressed to me by the Political Agent at Bahrain in which he reports the existence among the pearl fishing talent at Bahrain of the conviction that the banks fished from that centre are becoming depleted, and goes on to make certain suggestions in connection therewith. 2. It will be seen that the Nakhodas attribute the depletion to the inception and growth of the trade in oyster shells, whereby the banks are deprived of the fertilising influence of the empty shells which in former days used to be returned to the deep after examination for pearls. It is hy this trade in pearl-oyster shells, as I think the Government of India are aware, that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have been enabled to gain such a firm footing in the Gulf. 3. It would seem premature to enter into any lively discussion of the measures necessary to discourage the shell-trade or otherwise cope with the reported depletion, until expert opinion has been obtained as to whether it is due to the loss to the banks of the fertilising properties of the dead shells, or to other causes; and I feel sure that the Government of India will agree with Captain Mackenzie and myself as to the vital importance of probing the causes of the depletion and taking effective steps, if such are possible, to remedy it. No. 763, dated Bahrain, the 12th November 1910 (Confidential). Prom— Captain C. F. Mackenzie, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To— Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that such of the Nakhodas of Bahrain as are interested in pearling are very much disappointed at the number of oyster shells they are finding, and they alse complain that on the whole ^ such shells as are found appear to he of thinner quality than formerly, which in their opinion is due to the oysters not being fully developed and consequently there is less likelihood of obtaining pearls. They attribute this diminution to the practice of bringing away a large quantity of shells from the banks for sale in Bahrain, instead of the shells being thrown back into the sea as formerly. 2 . I had previously heard the opinion expressed by them that the throwing back of the old shells assisted the fertility of the beds, but had not considered the matter seriously until recently when this view ^ has been persistently presented to me by some of the leading Nakhodas. Originally I held it was just as herring or other fisheries are good in one year, and the next year had. The Nakhodas state that the amount of shells brought up hy the divers this year represents only 40 per cent, of the number eight years ago^ and that they have noticed a diminution the whole time but more especially in the last two years. This estimate of 40 per cent, is the highest given. Others estimate it at 25 per cent, but allowing for all exaggeration perhaps we may place it at 50 per cent. The nearest estimate to the number of pearling vessels is for— The year 1900 „ 1905 . 1978 F. D. 860 917 9702 2 Irrespective of numbers, tbe increase is about 12 per cent, which is the basis on which we may work, and although I have been unable to obtain figures it would appear that the increase of mainland vessels is approximately the same. The figures for the last ten years for exportation of pearls and shells are annexed. Enclosures A and B. It is possible that the large exports of shells of seasons 1903 and 1904 may have started the damage, and those of 1908 and 1909 seem to have rendered matters worse as the complaints specially refer to the last two years or seasons 1909 and 1910. The figures for pearl exports are deceiving and depend so very much on the value of pearls and the amounts remaining from one year to another, that I hardly think they can be taken to show the number of pearls found, and even if they did, they cannot be held to determine the number of oysters. As the percentage of pearls found to oysters fished up varies and as the pearl is generally supposed to be created by the oyster to alleviate some parasitic growth, it follows that the disease is more prevalent in some years than in others and therefore a proportionately larger number of pearls are found. I have been unable to obtain figures for the weights of actual pearls fished up during the past ten years, which would undoubtedly be the best even if erroneous method of coming to a conclusion as to whether the alleged decrease of oysters is an actual fact, and if so, to what extent. It will be impossible to get figures except for a few vessels as none of the people I have yet enquired from have kept accounts of these. It is moreover a matter which requires delicate treatment, as the first idea of ignorant people would be that I am collecting statistics to see if it were worth while for a European Company to exploit the banks. The figures for a few vessels will be of little value, and will possibly be misleading. I have not further delayed this letter to obtain them. Such as are obtain able will be forwarded shortly. There is no doubt that the present season Ms been extremely bad in respect to the number of pearls found. 3. The question to be solved is whether the decrease in shells is due to natural causes ; to pearling operations now extending beyond the recuperative powers of the banks ; or due to the depletion of banks by sale of oyster shells exported. As the matter is one of vital importance to the welfare of Bahrain and the whole of Arab Coast, I am of opinion that the cause attributed by the Arabs should be carefully considered by experts, and no doubt the experience gained on the Ceylon banks and other pearling localities will offer valuable assistance 4. I would point out— (a) The Oman divers have the last two years considerably reduced the sale of shells and practically none have been brought in from Katar this year and they are throwing the shells back into the sea. (&amp;) Many of the bigger Nakhodas do not permit their shells to be sold, and insist on their being returned to the sea, thus foregoing profits for the future benefit of the banks. Before the improvi dent Arab who has little thought for the future would do this, he must hold fairly strong opinions on the subject. There is however another reason for this, viz:, that they consider the busi ness of looking for pearls is likely to be scamped, if the men have the secondary employment of cutting out the oyster and preparing shells for sale. They also consider it unhealthy to keep the shells longer than necessary. &lt; &lt;5. Oyster shells when picked up not only have other small oyster shells attached to them, but appear to he the hosts of many other molluscs and parasites of different sorts. The larvae after release from the parent oyster are free to move where they like. Later on they stick to the bottom either close to the place of origin but on occasions at a considerable distance therefrom. They then fix themselves to shells, stones or other objects and assume the form of an oyster. They are that time only about ^th of an inch in diameter and it is more than possible that large numbers of these adhere to the shells, and were the shells returned to the water it seems probable that many of the minute oysters would survive the few hours which they remain in the pearling boat. In certain artificial beds the method is simply to distribute oyster shells over the ground, just before the spawning season, so as to afford domiciles to the young oysters. I say few hours, as there is no fixed procedure for examining the oysters for pearls. This depends on the quantity of shells found on any particular day, the state of the weather, the idiosyncrasies of the various Nakhodas, etc. Generally speaking, there are two examinations : one in the evening and the other in the morning. 6 . Oyster beds have been destroyed by over-fishing, by natural causes, probably disease as their enemies are few, and rarely by migration. In such instances it has frequently taken many years for the hank to recover itself. Locally it has long been known that certain hanks which yield abundantly one year may have very few oysters the next or even for several years in suc cession. It is therefore clear that the cause now attributed is not the sole reason for diminution. 7. At present natural causes for diminution are beyond our power of control, neither can we prevent increase of pearling vessels. There only remains the sale of shells. Even on the assumption that the theory adduced by the Nakhodas for the deficit is incorrect it would not be wise to take any risks in the matter as the shell trade is only a by-product of the pearl trade, and even in exceptional years it only amounts to about 4 per cent, the value of the latter. The fishers are Arabs and I am confident that a large number of the middle class Nakhodas will follow the bigger ones to make some combined effort for the coming season. Owing to lack of organization, the measures without our co-operation and guidance are likely to be only partially successful and a step of this nature is practically useless unless complete measures are taken. It is moreover necessary to contemplate the fact that the measures might have to proceed for five or ten years or even indefinitely. There is no doubt that our assistance in closing the shell trade would be warmly appreciated by the Arabs, who would then be convinced that we would sooner lose the trade in shells than see their pearl trade damaged. 8 . Government will desire to he fully convinced of the necessity before taking action to assist stopping the trade, and I regret I have not sufficient data to afford such proofs. It may be considered that for the following season it is sufficient to allow the Nakhodas to make their own preventive measures. In this case it will only be necessary to watch the results of the next pearl season. If they are favourable, no further action appears necessary; if unfavourable, complete measures can be taken for the season of 1912, and in the meantime the steps to he taken can be fully considered. Should Government wish to take fuller measures for the season of 1911, the only thing that is necessary in respect to Bahrain is for Sheikh Isa to proclaim that no shells will be allowed to be imported, or sold in Bahrain, and merchants making advances for shells will do so at their own risk.4 Such proclamation should issue by the New Year, when advances for shells will commence, or as soon after as is convenient. Each Sheikh may order his own subjects not to sell shells at sea. To obtain complete organization it would be preferable to take steps at Lingah as well as with the respective Chiefs, who I think will all willing co-operate. Sheikh Isa is not likely to care for the disruption of the shell trade as he gets four annas per bag export duty. With due explanation as to possibility of damage to pearl banks I feel sure he would readily assist. 9. The most serious loss ensuing on the stoppage of this trade will fall on Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., who would not be able to run their business in Bahrain at a profit without the assistance of shells. Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. would be the next heavy losers, but their interests in Bahrain are more varied. Thirdly loss would fall on the individual Arab and Persian merchants who ship shells. One Banniah firm occasionally also ships. A certain amount of freight would he lost by the British India Steam Navigation Company, while the Hamburg America Line would probably discontinue the occasional calls they make at Bahrain on the homeward voyage. It would also mean that intentions of any direct Home Line of British Steamers to call at Bahrain would probably fall through though not necessarily. Taking the profits at 30 per cent., which is doubtful now that competition has increased so largely, we only .get a loss of £ 8,000 in the biggest export year, while if in future years the export falls to half as I anticipate, we only obtain a loss of £4,000 w r hich in accordance with present proportion of trade would be distributed approximately as follows :— Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. • , • 1,100 Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. . . 1,100 Miscellaneous .... • • • 1,800 Total 4,000 Moreover as year by year the competition increases, the profits from this source decrease. Other losses will be to the Nakhodas, who get now about Its. 2 per cwt. It is thus seen that the losses are very trifling in comparison with the stake at issue. 10. The possibility of decrease in the output of the natural pearl banks would seem to point to the advisability of considering whether under any conditions it would be possible or political to form a Company for fertilizing and maintaining artificial beds within the territorial waters of Bahrain. Although waters so near land would not contain such promising localities as other positions yet they appear to he less open to general objections. Whereas there is no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the Tribes to debar other nations from dredging deep waters {vide letter No. 8 , dated 31st March 1905, from the India Office to His Excellency the Bight Hon ble the Governor-General of India in Council), there would assumably be the same difficulties in preventing artificial fertilization of likely spots over which the Tribes cannot maintain their right to exclusive possession. . The object in view, viz., prevention, might or might not be attainable by indirect methods. The policy of Government is, I believe, to maintain the rights of the Arabs, these rights could be upheld in the present proposal either by the employment of Arab capital, or the work might be carried out by means of a loan direct to Sheikh Isa. Should such fertilization within territorial waters prove a financial success, the operations could be extended to deeper waters, twhich in the meantime could be thoroughly examined by the expert who would be put in charge of the territorial water scheme. I think that in general consideration of this proposition the fact should also be borne in mind that it is unlikely that the Arabs will indefinitely hold to their present primitive methods of diving. The essential point seems to be that we should arrive first on the scene. This is a comparatively simple matter for Territorial waters, but not so for the deeper ones. ENCLOSURE A.

(Omit reference to German Consul, Bushire).Secret, No. 11. India Office, London, 21st May 1909. To His Excellency the Eight Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, The proposals made in Your Excellency’s Secret letter No. 188, Proposed Order in Council con ferringon the Political 'Agent at Bahrein jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in Bahrein. dated the 14th November 1907, for regularising the judicial powers exercised by the Political Agent at Bahrein, by the issue of an Order in Council placing both British subjects and foreigners under his jurisdiction, have been considered by His Majesty’s Government, in connection with the general question of the policy, political and com- meicial, to be followed in the Persian Gulf in order to meet the change in the situation consequent upon the development of the Bagdad Railway scheme. 2 . The general conclusion at which His Majesty’s Government have arrived is that “ the competition to wdiich British trade in the Persian Gulf is exposed is not merely commercial, but has a distinctly political “ object. British claims to political predominance in the Gulf are “ based mainly upon the fact of our commercial interests having hitherto “ been predominant, and should our trade, as a result of a German “ forward commercial policy, be impaired, our political influence would “ proportionately diminish. It follows that purely political action on “ our part, not having as its objective the development of material “ British interests, might have a prejudicial effect, both politically and “ commercially, by reason of the suspicions it would be likely to rouse.” 3. The proposals which you have made for the extension of the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Bahrein fall within the lines of policy approved by His Majesty’s Government. Their adoption would mark another stage in the development of the virtual protectorate which we exercise over Bahrein, to wdiich the growing importance of the island as a centre of trade may be attributed. 4. It wall tend to strengthen our position in Bahrein, and to remove risks of interference by other Powers, if jurisdiction over foreigners is placed in our hands. But our protectorate has never been formally notified, except to Turkey and Persia, and in the event of controversy arising with other Powers as to the assumption of jurisdiction overtheir subjects by the Political Agent, it will be preferable that our action should be based on a request from the Sheikh to be relieved of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners. When this has been arranged, an Order in Council can be issued. It does not seem expedient to make the Order in Council the medium of formally declaring a protectorate over Bahrein. Persian and Turkish claims to the sovereignty of the island have been repudiated by us in a form to preclude the necessity of any further discussion of the question with them. But neither Turkey nor Persia has formally abandoned its claims, and the Persian Government have not recognised, though we have consistently asserted, our right to protect Bahreinis in Persian territory. In the present political conditions of Turkey and Persia it is clear that we should scrupulously avoid any action that could be represented as an attempt to utilise their difficulties for selfish purposes. There is also the risk that the formal declaration of a protectorate might be regarded as a challenge by other Powers than Persia and Turkey, who might raise the question of our rights in a provocative form. 5. I request that the Political Agent at Bahrein may be instructed to approach the Sheikh, with the object of obtaining from him, as a necessary preliminary to the issue of the Order in Council, a request that the British Government will relieve him of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in the island. 6. As regards British subjects, no difficulty arises in respect of the proposed Order in Council in view T of the terms of Article 4 of the Treaty of 1861, and of the usage that has been established. 7. It will be convenient that the first draft of the'Order in Council should be prepared by Your Excellency’s Government, with a view to providing for any local peculiarities that may require consideration.

My Lord, On receipt of your Excellency’s letter No. 63 of the 10 th March 1904, on the question of the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf, I entered into communication with the Foreign Office with a view to obtaining the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown upon the legal and international points raised by your Excellency’s Government.

Your Excellency will see that the Law Officers of the Crown have no doubt as to the rights of the tribes in such waters as may justly he considered territorial. Outside territorial waters, they are inclined to hold that the exclusive rights of the tribes might be maintained to banks in regard to which their exclusive possession is capable of historical proof; but they consider that the point is not free from doubt. In regard to the deeper waters, they are of opinion that there would be no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. 4. In these circumstances, I agree with the general conclusion at which the Law Officers of the Crown have arrived, viz., that it is not expedient to raise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalities from fishing on the banks. The object in view may probably be attainable by indirect methods. I have the honour to be. My Lord, Your Lordsbip’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) St. John Brodrick.ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1 . India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, ® ir ’ &lt; 30t,b June 1904. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Brodrick to forward, to be laid before the Marquess of Lansdowne, a copy of a letter from the Govern ment of India in the Secret Department, No. 63, dated lOtli March 1904, on the subject of the policy to be pursued in order to prevent any interference by foreign enterprise with the rights enjoyed by the tribes under our protection in the pearl fisheries on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. The attention of the Government of India has again been called to the question by the proceedings of two Frenchmen who visited Bahrein in 1903, with the intention of prospecting the pearl fisheries round the island. The Chief of Bahrein refused to entertain their proposals, but it is reported that they are taking steps to procure from Europe the means of conducting fishing operations. No immediate action is necessary, but having regard to the serious nature of the situation which would arise if interlopers commenced fishing operations on pearl banks in respect of which the tribes would look to us to defend their monopoly, the Government of India request the opinion of His Majesty’s Government on the policy to be pursued in the event of such a contingency arising. The question of policy, as the Government of India indicate, is governed by that of the extent of the legal powers of intervention against foreign intrusion possessed by the British Government in virtue of their agreements with the tribes. The result of these agreements, under which the use of armed boats by the Ch efs is prohibited, has been to impose on us the responsibility for the maintenance of order in these waters, and the obligation to defend, so far as they can reasonably be substantiated, the rights of the tribes in the fisheries. A report by the Legal Adviser to this Office on the questions of law raised in the Government of India’s Despatch is enclosed, and Mr. Brodrick would suggest that the matter should be submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown with a view to ascertain the extent to which the Government of India might be authorised to intervene against interlopers, whether foreigners or British subjects, should the necessity arise. There can be no question, in Mr. Brodrick’s opinion, of the extreme desirability of securing to the tribes in the future the monopoly which they have hitherto enjoyed. The material facts may be stated as follows :— 1 . The pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. They extend, as shown on the charts enclosed with the Govern ment of India’s Despatch, from Umm-ul-Kawain to near the head of the Gulf. His Majesty’s Government lias agreements with the Arab Chiefs of Bas-al-Khaimah, Umm-aLKawain, Ajman, Shargah, Debai, Abu Dthabi and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs have practically sunendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The question of making a similar agreement with the Sheikh of El Katr is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. North of Bahrein the sovereignty over the western shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the.territories of the Sheikh of Koweit, whose special relations with His Majesty’s Government are known to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1 i I i % 2. Apparently all the tribes fish for pearls wherever they are to be found, and no tribe has exercised a right excluding the other tribes from any part of the fishery. 3. Only members of the tribes have hitherto fished for pearls in the waters. 4i. — (a) Portions of some of the pearl hanks lie within the three-mile territorial limit. (b) Some of the hanks extend from within the three-mile territorial limit outwards for several miles. (c) Some of the pearl hanks are entirely outside the three-mile territorial limit. In all these cases the tribes have exercised an exclusive right for fishing for pearls. 5. The tribes have not fished for pearls in the deep waters off the hanks, having no appliances for deep water fishing. It is apprehended that diving for pearls in such deep waters would materially injure the pearl fishery on the banks, and it is desired, if possible, to prevent dredging in such deep waters. 6 . The action to be taken for the protection of the pearl fishery would appear to depend on ( 1 ) the legal right of the tribes to a monopoly, and (2) the power of the British Government to act on their behalf. It is conceived that some precise delegation of authority to the British Government to act on behalf of the tribes in tin's matter would be necessary. 7. The Law Officers would probably advise as to 'the legal rights of the tribes within and also without the three-mile territorial limit, and as to the nature and extent of the delegation to be obtained, and further as to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Foreign Office. Annex. Report by the Legal Adviser to the India Office, dared 12th April 1904. Two distinct questions are raised in the Despatch of the Government of India. 1 . First, there is the question whether the British Government is in a position to assert and vindicate the rights possessed by the Chiefs over the waters which adjoin their territories. This, it seems to me, is a question of fact. If it is correct to say that the Chiefs have all agreed to leave the protection of their interests in the hands of the British Government, then the existence or non-existence of a treaty defining their relations or imposing on the Government the obligation of affording that protection does not seem to me material. So long as anv act done by officers ol the Government can be proved to have been done under the authority of the Chiefs w T hose territory may be concerned, then those officers have, I think, a complete defence (see Carr v. Times, 1902, A C. 176). Nor do I think that any foreign iState could complain of such an act, pio\rded ot course that it was an act Tvhich, it done bv the Chief himself, would not have transgressed the rules of Internationaf law. 2. As i egards the extent of the jurisdiction of a State beyond the limits of its own shores, I do not think I can do better than'' cite the opinion of the Law Officers of the Government of India in the case of the Mergui pearl fisheries, that opinion having been approved by the Law Officers of the Crown. They wrote as follows: ec We are of “ opinion that the British Government possesses territorial jurisdiction “ over the sea within a belt or zone of three miles from the shores of m« mainland of the provinces of Zeh, Tavoy, Mergni,and Tenasserim, and ot the islands appertaining thereto, including the Mergui &lt;{ 1 chipelago; as also over all bays, gulfs, and estuaries inter fauces terrce, whether of such mainland or islands, hut no farther.” While adopting the opinion as correct, the Law Officers of the Crown add, with reference to the Australian and Ceylon fisheries : “ The Australian Fishery Acts are limited in their operation to British subiects, ailc&lt; assume that, in the case of the pe irl fisheries in the Mergui Archipelago, there has not been, as in the case of the Ceylon fisheries, arL immemorial claim to the pearl-oyster fishery bevond the usual “ territorial waters asserted by successive rulers and 'acquiesced in.” (AAe Revenue, Statistics, and Commerce Tapers, 1893, December.) This opinion, it is to be observed, was given after the publication of the award in the Behring Sea Arbitration, which took place in August of the same year. In that arbitration a claim similar to that suggested in the sixth paragraph of the Despatch was put forward on behalf of the United States ; it was met by strong arguments on behalf of the British Government {see Chapter VIII. of British Case and Argument, p. 36), ancl was negatived by the award. With regard to the Ceylon precedent, which among others was relied on by the United States in support of their claim to a right of some sort extending beyond the three-mile limit, it is pointed out in the argument that these fisheries “ have been “ treated from time immemorial by the successive rulers of the Island “as subjects of property and jurisdiction, and have been so regarded “ with the acquiescence of all other nations.” The Ceylon case thus stated is, in fact, one which illustrates the proposition that a portion of the high sea may he appropriated by dint of actual occupation in the same way as land may be so occupied. If a similar assertion of owner ship and acquiescence could he proved with regard to the fisheries in the Persian Gulf outside the three-mile limit, I think those fisheries would he taken to he included within the territory of the State to which they are contiguous. Otherwise, the three-mile limit must prevail, for that is the rule which a State is supposed to adopt in the absence of express notice that a larger extent is claimed (see Hail on International Law, p. 154). In order to apply the above principles to the case of any particular fishing ground (for I presume there are distinct fishing grounds), it may be necessary to institute a moim detailed inquiry than has already been made, so that it may he decided whether in that particular case it is expedient to assert a claim by right of occupation larger than that which the ordinary rule would justify.

The Government of India have called the attention of His Majesty’s Government in the annexed letter to the fact that by the steps they have consistently taken for more than a century to maintain the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf, they have deprived the Arab Chiefs on the coast of the means of forcibly protecting their interests in the pearl fisheries, and that they therefore feel themselves to be under an obligation to defend those rights in so far as they can reasonably be substantiated. They cite instances in the past in which they have have successfully intervened to prevent the intrusion both of ’foreigners, by diplomatic means, and of British subjects. They recognise, however, that the position is difficult, both in regard to British subjects and from the point of view of international law. They therefore desire to ascertain the extent to which they may be authorised to intervene, should the necessity arise.The material facts may be stated as follows :— 1. The pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Bahrein. They extend, as shown on the charts enclosed with the Government of India’s letter, from Um-ul- Khnvain to near the head of the Gulf. His Majesty’s Government has identical agreements with the Arab Chiefs of Bas-ul-Khaimah, Um-ul- Kawain, A jman, Shargah, Hebai, Abu Dthabi and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs have practically surrendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The territory of these Chiefs comprises the Arabian coast of the Gulf off which the pearl banks lie up to the island of Bahrein, with the exception of the promontory of El Katr, with whose Chief the question of making a similar agreement is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. North of Bahrein the sovereignty over the Arabian shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit, who has special relations with His Majesty’s Government. 2.

It must be added that none of the tribes have any judicial system or courts of law for dealing with trespassers or trespassing boats. 7. The Law Officers might be asked to advise as to the legal rights of the tribes within, and also without, the three-mile territorial limit; and as to the nature and extent of the delegation to be obtained; and, further, as to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers and dealing 9 with their^boats and fishing appliances.

I have the honour to transmit to yon herewith, by direction of the Marquess of Lansdowne, the papers noted in the accompanying list, relative to the question of the steps to be taken to prevent foreign interference with the rights enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf in the pearl fisheries. It will be observed, from the India Office letter of the 30th June (Annex A\ that the Government of India have called the attention of Ilis Majesty’s Government to the fact that, by the steps they have con sistently taken for mo» c than a century t &gt; maintain the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf, they have deprived the Arab Chiefs on the coast of the means of: forcibly protecting their interests in the pearl fisheries, and that they therefore feel themselves to be under an obligation to deftmd those rights in so far as they can reasonably be substantiated.

The pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf, and off the coast of Bahrein. They extend, as shown on the charts (Annex B), inclosed with the Government of India’s letter, from Um-ul-Kawain to near the head of the Gulf. His Majesty’s Govern ment have identical agreements (Annex C) with the Arab Chiefs of Bas-ul-Khaimah, Um-ul-Kawain, Ajman, Shargah, Debai, Abu Dthabi, and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs have practically surrendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The terri tory of these Chiefs comprises the Arabian coast of the Gulf off which the pearl banks lie up to the island of Bahrein, with the exception of the promontory of El Katr, with whose Chief the question of making a similar agreement is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. North of Bahrein, the sovereignty over the Arabian shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit, wdio has special relations with His Majesty’s Government. 2 .

My Lord, Law Officers’ Department, Royal Courts of Justice, llth February 1905. S. 5. CAs regards tlie iisheries beyond territorial waters, we tliinlv that a distinction must be drawn between the banks^ where the tribes have practised pearl fishing and the deep waters in which no such fishery lias been carried on by them. As regards the pearl banks, we think that, as a mattei ol inter national law, they are capable of being the property of^ the tribes to the exclusion of all nations. In addition to the passage cited Irom Vattel, reference maybe made to Puffendorfs Treatise “do jure Naturae et gentium,” Book IV., Chapter V., Section 7, and to toe recent; work of Professer Westlake, “International Law,” Part 1., chapter 9, at pages 186 and 187, and the case of the protection ol the Ceylon pearl banks is a striking illustration of the assertion of this right in practice. Whether such rights, in fact, exist with regard to these particular pearl banks in the Persian Gulf is a question the answer to which cannot be given with ;my certainty, as it depends on the^ evidence available of historical facts with reference to the enjoyment of these fisheries by the tribes and the exclusion of others from them. As iai as we can judge, upon the materials before us, we think that there aie giounds toi asserting the existence of such an exclusive right, and we do not think that, in point of law, the fact that the enjoyment was by the tiibes in common would prevent the acquisition of the right in question. Having regard to the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the tribes on the west shore of the Persian Gulf, we think that the existence of this exclusive right may be properly maintained on their behalf by His Majesty’s Government With regard to the deep waters in which pearl fishing has not oeen carried on by the tribes we think the case is different. There is here no defined area at the bottom of the sea over which the right of fishing has been exercised to the exclusion of other nations, as tnere is some ground for saving was the case with regard to the pearl banks. We cannot see that the right claimed by the tribes to exclude other nations from these deeper waters could be asserted with any reasonable chance of success. (2) Having regard to the importance of protecting the deeper waters and to fhe fact that for the reasons above indicated it cannot be regarded as certain that the right, even to the pearl banks, could be established to the satisfaction of any international tribunal, we think that it would be preferable to discourage foreign interference by refusing supplies, &amp;c., as suggested in the papers before us. If such measures prove inadequate it may be necessary, having obtained the authority of the Chiefs for this purpose, to compel the removal of vessels engaged in fishing on the pearl banks. Of course, measures of this kind must be taken with caution, as international complications might result irom any precipitate action. It might also be practicable—whether it-should be done or not is a matter of policy—to raise the question in a form suitable for decision by the Hague Tribunal. Pishing within the territorial waters may, of course, be prevented. Generally. W T e desire to add that, having regard to the importance of the question to the tribes, and the fact that we cannot be certain of establishing the right claimed, it is probably desirable that the fishing by foreigners should, if possible, be indirectly stopped without raising the question internationally.

Through their correspondent in Hamburg, Messrs. Gray Paul were able to supply me confidentially with some figures indicating the amount of their own and Messrs. Wonckhaus s consignments to Hamburg during the seasons 1004 to 1907, thus— The Bushire Agent of the English firm at the same time quoted to me a com munication received from his London Office which was in the following terms :— “ We are as anxious as they are (the Bushire Residency) to develop our shell interests not only for its own sake but also to limit the threatened expan sion of the German Trade, but if German steamers and German Agents are getting Government support as we are thoroughly satisfied they must be getting, to continue running and working as they are doing, it is exceedingly difficult for private enterprise to hold their own. * * * You might tell Major Cox that I have discussed our shell business with Milborrow (their Bahrein representa tive then at home) and he confirms my opinion that we are better off in continu ing on the same lines as hitherto than in adopting the German method, which means making large advances to people who will one of these days let them in. We are doing all we canto assist Sheikh Jasim (bin Thani) of Katar over his holdings of pearls and with his interest and influence on our side I hope we shall be able to control the bulk of the shells from that part of the Coast ” Katar). 3 . Mr. Milborrow, the Bahrein representative, returned to his post in April and before joining was summoned to Basrah to confer with the Bushire and Basrah Agents of the Firm regarding the present question. In the result they decided that the Firm could not trade safely or profitably on the lines now followed by the German Firm either in buying the pearls from the dhows on the pearl banks or in giving large advances to native middlemen to purchase shells for them ; but though hesitating over the appointment of an Englishman to represent them at Lingah, on the score of expense, they have for the time being deputed a capable and experienced East Indian employe to that port for a year to replace their present useless factotum and especially to work up the Persian Coast and Trucial Oman trade. This new representative was expected to arrive at Debai, a few days after I left, on a short visit for the purpose of examining this branch of the trade on the spot and reporting to his principals on the possibilities of further successful enterprise. I myself talked over the problem with the Trucial Sheikhs individually. No syst em of monopoly appears to be workable in practice owing to the difficulty of enforcement. The position at present is that promis cuous Persian boats come over from time to time from the Lingah Coast and buy up any shells that are found accumulated. Although the presumption may be that they are working for or in association with Messrs. Wonckhaus’s Lingah Agent, there is no outward indication that such is the case. The Sheikhs while explaining that it would not be worth their while to handle the shells them selves except in pursuance of some specific arrangement with an English Firm, Messrs* Gray Paul. Messrs. Wonckhaus. 1904- 05 1905- 06 1906- 07 ... 12,088 bags. ... 7»785 .. ... 10,083 „ 16,434 bags, 2*317 „ 4.2092 assured me that if Messrs. Gray Paul’s Agent at Debai or anyone else represent ing a British Firm was anxious to purchase shells, and ready to pay as good a price as anyone else, they were prepared to ensure that they had the first refusal. I told them that they might shortly expect a visit from Messrs. Gray Paul’s Agent in this connection. I may mention here that further enquiries show that the shells are thrown overboard while the dhows are on the pearl banks, not so much for want of storage but because the stench arising from them makes the dhows unbearable and unhealthy. Consequently all that is brought to the shore is the catch of the 24 hours preceding the dhows’ visit to the port. 4. The position amounts to this :— The circumstances of competition on the spot are outwardly fair, Messrs. Wonckhaus having no local faiclities for obtaining the shells which British firms have not ; but the British Firms aver that the Germans must be in receipt of strong Government support in the shape of rebates or subsidies sufficient to enable them to buy on terms on which Messrs. Gray Paul cannot trade profitably. Their Agent at Bahrein assured me that the Germans had very large sums out in reckless advances given in many cases to most untrustworthy persons, some of whom were sure to let them in, and further that they had large stocks lying accumulated in Hamburg unsold and unsaleable. He cannot understand how they can make the business pay under such conditions. 5. The entry of another British firm such as Messrs. Lynch into the lists would naturally not be welcome to Messrs. Gray Paul as the effect would simply be to increase the rates of purchase for everybody and in the absence of sub sidies would not put the German firm in difficulties. I may mention in this connection that since their communication to Government, Messrs. Lynch have made no further move towards taking up the shell trade; at present therefore we have only Messrs. Gray Paul to think about and it appears that the only way this Firm can be assisted is by a subsidy in one form or another such as would enable them to place one of their best English Agents at Lingah and to pay better prices than Messrs. Wonckhaus. With reference to the suggestions made in paragraph 8 (i) and (ii) in the above direction, it would seem that Directorates of the British India Steam Navigation Company and Messrs. Gray Paul in London would be the natural bodies for His Majesty’s Government to sound on the subject if anything in the direction of subsidies is considered feasible. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Legation. r r ij 1, t. [ Confidential.'] No. 205, dated Bushire, the 19th (received 28th) January 1908. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. la reply to your telegram No. S.-526, dated 18th November 1907, and with reference to the two communications marginally cited, on the subject of the trade in mother-o-pearl from the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to submit my views as follows. (1) Report by Messrs. Lynch’s Agent, Basrah, dated 10th July 1907, forwarded to Foreign Office tinder cover of Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ letters dated 3rd September 1907. (2) Memorandum by Mr. G. A. Lloyd forming enclosure to despatch No. 639, dated 30th September 1907, from His Majesty’s Ambassador, Constanti nople, to His Majesty’s Foreign Office. u 2. In regard to the first of the reports quoted, I may mention that the writer, Messrs. Lynch’s Agent at Basrab, consulted me confidentially in April last as to the prospects of an opening for the operations of another British firm in the shell trade, with a view to his making an early personal tour of investigation. I expressed the opinion that Lingah and Debai offered pros pects for fresh enterprise, and in advising him in |the first instance to pay both places a personal visit in order to examine the ramifications of the industry on the spot, I offered him all practicable assistance in the prosecution of his enquiries. I heard no more in the latter connection, hut gather from his present report that he was unable to undertake any tour without consulting his principals, his communication to whom is mainly a transcript of notes furnished to him by the Residency in reply to his confidential enquiry. 3. In neither report does sufficient credit seem to be allowed to the important connection which Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. have always had with this trade. They were the first European firm to take it up, long before Mr. Wonckhaus came to the Gulf, and have not in any way reduced their | operations. I shall have more to say later in this letter on the subject of their position, but before doing so I venture to mention one or two passages in Mr. Llyod’s suggestive memorandum which call for brief modification or preliminary comment: (i) The fact that Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. are Agents for the British India Steam Navigation Company at Bahrein or Lingah, as well as general import and export merchants on their own independent account, has perhaps led His Majesty’s Ambassador and the Government of India to suppose that the British India Steam Navigation Company as such are interested in the trade ; but this is not the case, it is Messrs. Gray Paul on their own account who operate in shells and the British India Steam Navigation Company’s only interest in the commodity is represented by the extent of freight which they earn on^ ship ments of it via Bombay. To Messrs. Gray Paul they give no better terms than to Mr, Wonckhaus or anyone else. (w) The statement that the German steamers are bringing out Manchester goods from Manchester. At one time the Hamburg-Amerika Line did threaten to make London and Manchester ports of call for their steamers, hut so far as is known the threat has never been acted on. They bring no Manchester goods to Bushire, but it is understood that they do to Basrah and Baghdad. The Manchester firms, who ship these goods by the German steamers, presumably only do so because they get sufficiently better terms from the line to cover the extra expense which must clearly be incurred in first sending the cargo by British steamers from London to Hamburg for transhipment. It^ seems important that the full facts in this respect should be ascertained in England, and if possible a remedy devised to obviate the practice. I am endeavouring to obtain the names of such Manchester shippers. (m) The reported increase of the German Service to Basrah to two sailings monthly. 1 . 9 jThis was only the case for a few weeks of high pressure during the date packing season at Basrah and never became a permanent arrangement One sailing monthly is the regular programme and, according to past experience and their most recent time-table, is ordinarily adhered to. (iv) The question of rebates granted to Messrs. Wonckhaus bv the Hamburg-Amerika Line was briefly referred to in the Confidential Beport on the first year’s operations of the Hamburg-Amerika for ^ ai : ded with letter No * 2473 &gt; date( l 27th November 1907, and m connection with my present observations I would invite reference to the notes recorded in that document under the hetul of Lin gab and Bahrein exports. It was stated there that the rebate allowed was Is. per ton, but I have since heard it quoted as being anything from Is. to 2 s. and 6 d. per ton. The fact is that while it is known that Messrs. Wonckhaus do ship on special terms, it cannot be ascertained precisely what those terms are. . 4 * Reverting now to the question of Messrs. Gray Paul’s operations and their value, I beg to furnish the following information. As before mentioned they have handled the shell trade for many years before Mr. Wonckhaus I appeared on the scene. Thus at the end of 1892 or beginning of 1893 thev obtained a concession from Sheikh Esa granting them the exclusive right to purchase and export shells from Bahrein. This, however, annoyed the Sheikh’s mercantile dependents and they made such insistent protests against the monopoly that before long the Sheikh was obliged to appeal to he Residency to support him in the cancellation of the concession. In the result tbA TWri firm ® ul ’ rendered the privilege on receiving an assurance through the Residency that no concession should be granted to any other party In n?? M6 iT G lu y Paul com P lained once or twice that Sheikh Esa was said fibp^ir i pl f ng i h t grant of a ooooossion to some native firm, but the one™ rnnl deD T ed ^ imp . ea&lt; *T nfc and fhe trade has remained practically Ers Grav Paul w 7 pra f tlca1 ^ be ^nse as a matter of fact it appears that essrs. Gray Paul were able, and as compensation for the loss of t0 ? r ^ ai1 u P° nthe Sheikh to allow them to export shells preferential rates of export duty compared to the general public h ° We J e I- tliatthis advantage they have nowfost, owing to British ° a findmg ^ 0utj haviB g demanded similar treatment.

As the result of making contracts with middlemen to buy at the daily bazaar t&amp;iz plus 20 percent, commission, their Agents have consequently been putting up prices against one another so as to increase their commission. Their native clerks too haye^ been allowed to buy shells for them at fixed rates on commission^ and as the clerks receive the shells from the boatmen themselves, they have made special arrangements with the latter who have been allowed to give short weights. The cost of their shells must consequently work out to a very high price, and personally I cannot see how they can possibly come out on the right side of such transactions, as shells in the ! j first place cannot stand a commission of 20 per cent. ,, 6 . So far then as Bahrein is concerned, it will, I think, be conceded' that \ Messrs. Gray Paul are doing their best according to their lights to withstand the competition, and that, as indicated in the figures quoted in the report of Messrs. Lynch s Agent, they have during 1906 (a year in which their home contracts were unusually limited) shipped or controlled the shipment of 11,000 bags as compared with 7,500 bags handled by Messrs. Wonckhaus. Por the coming year they have already contracted to send home 700 tons, which is more than they have ever shipped before. There is no question, however, that their operations have been made more difficult than of old, in the first instance owing to the cessation of the preferential treatment before mentioned which they formerly received from Sheikh Esa, and secondly owing to the direct German sailings inaugurated from Bahrein to Hamburg and the rebate enjoyed by Mr. Wonckhaus in connection therewith. The latter, like Messrs. Gray Paul, used to ship his shells by British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers via Bombay, and the English firm still habitually ships by its ovvn line to Bombay and thence to Hamburg, but on one or two occasions has been forced to ship by the German steamers. On the whole, even though it involves a ctrtain amount of damage during transhipment, Messrs. Gray Paul consider it more to their interests to ship their consignments in small quantities regularly via Bombay as they come to hand, rather than to have to accumulate in Bahrein a stock sufficient to tempt a home-going British steamer at long and irregular intervals to call and take it direct to Hamburg. I have treated of the Bahrein aspect of the question thus fully for the reason before mentioned, namely, that the two commentaries under reference seem to have taken insufficient cognizance of Messrs. Gray Paul’s efforts. 7 In regard to Lingah, there is a much less satisfactory story to tell, Here Mr. Wonckhaus has had it all his own way from the beginning. Messrs, Gray Paul’s reason for refraining at the start to compete with him at that port was that they calculated they could not run a satisfactory agency there with a native representative, and that the trade to be done there, whether in shells or other commodities, was not sufficient to warrant the expense of deputing a European. ^ The reasons for this are explained in the report of Messrs. Lynch’s Agent and in the official Lingah Trade Report for 1905. It is difficult, however, to understand how it is that they could not make a living where Mr. Wonckhaus could. The urgency of better representation has been hitherto pressed upon them repeatedly without avail, but I am glad to say that they intend immediately to send one of their superior staff there as an experimental measure who would also have the Trucial Coast within his beat. 7. {a) So much for the existing position. It now remains to devise, if possible, means for altering it, obstructive or constructive, as Mr. Lloyd suggests. It is beyond doubt that if the demand could be created the export of shells is capable of great expansion, from the mere fact that at present a large proportion of the shells brought up from the bottom are thrown back a^ain by the pearling boats owing to want of room; but past experience of°the demand, which has fluctuated considerably, seems to indicate that it is not likely to develop much greater proportions unless the Australian trade fails. The object is therefore not so much to increase our own operations by opening new channels, but to wrest some of the present volume of trade from German hands.4 A s an obstructive measure, Mr. Lloyd suggests that influence he exerted upon A the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast calculated to throw the trade^into British hands. I have not neglected this course, and a warn ng *»!.»“ » ■ “Vra.Th,. ' b k M r “ot, , fr i, &lt;■&lt;* ^ ^ ^ backward, thick-witted and unbusinesslike. I am of opinion that anything in the shape of a grant to a British mer- chant or merchants of a monopoly of purchase, such at Bahrein would he unworkable, either on shore or at the peail ban , b t t seems a feasible course that the Trucial Chiefs should severally arrogate to themselves the exclusive right of purchasing shells from their own subjects and should then be influenced to sell only to approved persons. It must be remembered, however, that this course might tend todrivethe pearlers to transfer the sale of their shells from the ^7® \%tm P the Sheikhs order to realise higher prices there than they could get from the Sheikhs whereas it should be one of our chief objects to keep Mr Monckhaus b at away from the pearl banks and relegate their operations to the snore. I ha tatofan°early opportunity of sounding the Sheikhs on the subject generally and will report further after doing so. 8 . In the direction of constructive measures the following are suggested for consideration:— (i) To press the British India Steam Navigation Company to give ( ^ British shippers of shells to Bombay and Hamburg by their steamers liberal preferential rates. The shipment are not so extensive as to make such a concession any real burden upon them. \ (U )Bor Government to grant a rebate to British firms of, say, 5 ^ 2s. 6d. per ton of shells shipped to Europe or of such a less sum as would enable them to compete with Messrs. Wonckhaus, on equal or slightly better terms, either at Bahrein or Lingah. (Hi) The transfer of purchase from the shore to the pearl banks and the V ; lightering of shells from the boats at the banks, either by dhow or steam lighter. Those best in a position to judge believe that this course could not Pj*y if a steam lighter were employed, and would not in the case of dhows bem 0 employed. It would appear, however, that Mr. Wonckhaus finds the course profitable ; and Messrs. Gray Paul have promised to give the experiment another trial during the coming season. They fear that purchase at sea is likely to prejudice their dealings on shore. (iv) The import to Bahrein and elsewhere, if necessary, of some simple machinery for cutting the pearl shells into discs, in order to save space and freight. It would be quite reasonable for a monopoly to be granted for the exclusive use of such a machine. Messrs. Gray Paul’s Agent tells me that some years ago he wrote home to see what was to he got, but the article was not obtainable in England and no enquiries were made on the Continent. (v) To endeavour to promote a pearl button factory in England in order to attract the trade to London. At present the manufactory of buttons seems to be confined to Germany and Austria. (vi) The institution of a small free British port at Bassidu or better still at Abu Musa, if we could buy it from the Sheikh of Shargab. This suggestion is perhaps a visionary one, hut as a means of stifling com petition it seems to possess many possibilities.9.^ Messrs. Gray Paul’s late Agent at Bahrein is shortly coming out from a year s leave at home, of which he has spent some time in Hamburg studying the shell question. I have suggested to their Agent here that on his return ^about a month hence, the Agents at Bushire, Bahrein, and the member of the firm above mentioned should meet in consultation, and try and work out a plan of campaign. He has promised to arrange this, and I will in the mean- while go into the question on the Trucial Coast. The question of the Persian Coast produce is the most difficult to handle, and I have not at present any useful suggestion to make in connection therewith. G. I, C. P.

As an immediate measure, and one that can be taken before next fishing season, I venture to suggest that the attention of the British India Steam Navigation Company, who apparently already do some work in the shell fishing at Bahrein, should be drawn to the question, and that they should be urged to make arrangements for the extension of this branch of their trade in the forthcoming season.

A TANGIBLE proof of the energy and insistency with which Germany is of the Persian Gulf, written by Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ agent at Bussorah, and forwarded to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs on the 19th September. The subject deserves considerable attention and stress laid upon it, inasmuch as which few people at first sight would be likely to take more than a cursory interest. Any student of Persian Gulf history cannot fail to have observed and noted that the rulers of that sea, and those who have obtained ascendency of influence on its coasts have always and only been those nations who have established strong and unrivalled commercial interests there. From the days of Sinbad’s roving enterprise down to to-day the shores of the Persian Gulf have witnessed a perpetual succession of commercial struggles, and Portuguese and Dutch, Dutch and English, all alike, fought for the preservation of their commercial interests, and in no case was there a clear idea of any political aim until many years after the English supremacy had been of England in the Persian Gulf—the outcome, it is repeated, of commercial struggles with the Dutch—proves the point generally acknowledged, but often forgotten, that political ascendency in the Persian Gulf is the direct outcome of, and only to be insured by, a strong commercial predominance over all other nations. This fact, so clearly established, gives the present commercial activity of Germany in the Persian Gulf an especial importance, and the news that Germany is in a fair way to get a complete monopoly of the most important natural trade of the Persian [B] ASIATIC TURKEY. CONFIDENTIAL. [October 7.] Section 1. -^3254] Sir N. O’Conor to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received October 7.) No. 1 . (No. 639. Confidential.) Sir, Therapitt) September 30, 1907. Inclosure in No. 1 . attempting to rival our commercial and political interests in the Persian Gulf comes recently to hand in the information contained in a letter on the pearl-shell industry the most recent expose of the above-mentioned policy is disclosed through a subject in established, and Indian interests were found to be insolubly bound up with the position we had won for the sake of commercial enterprise. The present position then [2675 g —1]Gulf into her hands demands, I submit, immediate and studied attention and action on the part of His Majesty’s Government. It may be argued that His Majesty’s Government is not in a position to go far, or to take a new course in assisting directly the British trader against a German competitor. But the situation in the Persian Gulf is a new one and a special one, and demands special and new methods. Where the competing trade is a “ fair ” one, that is to say, where it is the outcome of unassisted private enterprise, it should be unnecessary, and is certainly unwise, to destroy the independence of the British trader by any form of Government^ help, but where the British trader is faced with subsidized rivals (an impossibility C prove, hut an undoubted fact), it becomes time to consider whether tactics designed to impair British political supremacv in the Gulf should not be met with similar tactics. The absorption of the mother-of-pearl industry of the Persian Gulf by Germany has the following danger, and one not common to other trades in the Gulf. The Germans, in pursuit of this industry, have established relations with many Sheikhs and villages on the coast; they own boats, and are employers of local labour, which facilitates their getting into touch with Sheikhs and Trucial Chiefs, who, possessed of our protection, and pledged to abstention from political relations with all other Powers, would not be allowed to have such intercourse in any other way. To pursue this policy a very little further into an uninterrupted future, I think it is not an unfair assumption to make that the same nation who got possession of Kiao Chau may very consistently find a cause, should any accident occur or any attack be made by Arabs or pirates upon any of the fishing craft owned by Germans, for the despatch of German gun-boats, and for consequent political interference in a region where they have as yet no political interest in any shape or form. I suggest that this is no improbable or far-fetched view of the future, but only a fair summing-up of probabilities based upon Germany’s past methods in establishing her political' influence, and as this is probably the best manner in which that object could be attained, it is probably the course which she will adopt. The question is, then, what can be done, as a temporary measure at first and as a permanent one afterwards, to secure the transference of this trade from German into British hands, and to lessen the danger occasioned by the acute commercial rivalry with which England is being faced in the Persian Gulf. The methods adopted must, I submit, be obstructive at first and constructive afterwards, the former to be used until the latter are in operation. Obstructive methods in this connection are simple, and especially so in the Gulf. The head-quarters, or at any rate one of the most important places, for pearl-shell fisheries being at Sharga and along the neighbouring coast, where British relations with the Trucial Chiefs are both intimate and friendly, it would only he necessary for instructions and explanations to be sent to His Majesty’s Resident in the Persian Gulf that “ no facilities ” should be given by the Sheikhs to German traders or agents who | were not provided, say, with introductions from His Majesty’s Resident. Nothing need be done on paper, and if His Majesty’s Resident were allowed his customary discretion in local dealings with the Chiefs, there is no question that the many difficulties inseparable from trading with Arabs on such a desolate coast could be intangibly but certainly be made very formidable. The trade would gradually transfer itself to the British firm ready to take it up. But these obstructions must result in a constructive scheme to insure the proper working of the pearl-shell business at a minimum of cost and the maximum of profit by Messrs. Gray Dawes, Messrs. Lynch, or any other firm of good standing acquainted with the trade of the Gulf who may be ready to take up the business actively. According to the information given in the letter above mentioned from Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ agent at Bussorah, the chief reasons which enable Germans to compete so successfully in this trade are— 1 . That Hamburg has become a better market for the shells than London ; 2. That the porterage and storage duties, &amp;c., at that port are some 10 per cent, cheaper than at the port of London ; 3 . That the Hamburg American steamers quote cheaper rates of freight than British steamers. As regards the first two points, I suggest that if it be true that greater facilities exist at Hamburg, and that the demand is also larger there than in London, no attempt should be made to divert the trade at once from Hamburg to London. It isonly economical and wise that trade should he allowed to follow its natural course, provided always that in so doing it does not endanger other greater interests^ and the main danger will have been averted as soon as this trade is being done by British and not German merchants in the Persian Gulf itself, and as soon as it is conveyed in British and not German ships. It is then essential absolutely that an attempt should be made and pressure brought to bear on the British direct lines, with a view to obtaining special low rates of freight for this trade to Hamburg and London. The rates quoted by both German and British Steamer Companies from the ^^ersian Gulf are reasonable, and only vary from each other, as a rule, by about 2 s. 6 d., but there is every probability that the German lines give very large rebates on the rates quoted for this trade, and it should, I venture to suggest, be pointed out clearly to the British Steam-ship Companies that, if the trade is to be transferred to British hands, it is imperative that, for a short time at any rate, they should be prepared, ev ® IL at a sacrifice, to underquote any rates given by the German steamers. It may be replied by them that they have sufficient trade without this shell trade, hut they should be made to realize that in losing this trade they are risking losing other trades also. Messrs. Lynch’s agent forcibly demonstrates this fact when he alludes to the way in which Germans at Lingah are getting a grasp of the Manchester trade, and are bringing out cotton goods in which they cannot as yet compete themselves^from Manchester in German steamers. # . The manner in which the Germans are extending their grasp of trade m the Persian Gulf, when necessary through the temporary medium of British goods, afterwards to be counterletalwhen the trade is in their hands, constitutes a grave menace to British shipping in the Gulf, and it is a matter which I am convinced is not clearly realized in a practical manner by thefBritish Steam-ship Companies, who rely for information entirely on their agents, who may not have sufficient grasp of the general situation, or of the trend of German policy, to fully apprehend the danger thcit; exists. British steamers at present continually call at llotterdam, and in making Hamburg an additional port of call they would neither seriously lengthen their iourney nor increase their expenditure. In conclusion, I suggest that the scheme here proposed might, and very probably would, lead up to the establishment of a monopoly to one or several British firms, Granted, say, for some’consideration, by the Chiefs in the pearl-shell trade, and similar to the successful monopoly established by the Italians at Massowah. I understand that the Hamburg-America Company are now beginning to run a service of two instead of one steamers per month to Bussorah, which may be taken as a proof not only of their determination to create interests in the Persian Gulf, but of the success with which they are doing it. ^ , . . I venture then to reiterate that it is of urgent importance to British commercial and political influence in the Persian Gulf that this matter, apparently somewhat insignificant at first sight, but one affecting and touching at the root and basis ot British influence there, should be taken up immediately and studied in a manner that may so easily insure the success of the object in view, and the further safeguarding or the vital interests of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf.K .. - V \ India Office, London, 31st March 1905.

Your Excellency will see that the Law Officers of the Crown have no doubt as to the rights of the tribes iu such waters as may justly be considered territorial. Outside territorial waters, they are inclined to hold that the exclusive rights of the tribes might be maintained to banks in regard to which their exclusive possession is capable of historical proof; but they consider that the point is not free from doubt. In regard to the deeper waters, they are of opinion that there would be no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. 4. In these circumstances, I agree with the general conclusion at which the Law Officers of the Crown have arrived, viz., that it is not expedient to raise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalities from fishing on the banks. The object in view may probably be attainable by indirect methods. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) St. John Brodrick. S. 5.ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 30tb June 1904. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Brodrick to forward, to be laid before the Marquess of Lansdowne, a copy of a letter from the Govern ment of India in the Secret Department, No. 63, dated 10 th March 1904, on the subject of the policy to be pursued in order to prevent any interference by foreign enterprise with the rights enjoyed by the tribes under our protection in the pearl fisheries on the Arabian Coast of; the Persian Gulf. The attention of the Government of India has again been called to the question by the proceedings of two Frenchmen who visited Bahrein in 1903, with the intention of prospecting the pearl fisheries round the island. The Chief of Bahrein refused to entertain their proposals, but it is reported that they are taking steps to procure from Europe the means of conducting fishing operations. No immediate action is necessary, but having regard to the serious nature of the situation which would arise if interlopers commenced fishing operations on pearl banks in respect of which the tribes would look to us to defend their monopoly, the Government of* India request the opinion of His Majesty’s Government on the policy to be pursued in the event of such a contingency arising. The question of policy, as the Government of India indicate, is governed by that of the extent of the legal powers of intervention against foreign intrusion possessed by the British Government in virtue of their agreements with the tribes. The result of these agreements, under which the use of armed boats by the Ch'efs is prohibited, has been to impose on us the responsibility for the maintenance of order in these waters, and the obligation to defend, so far as they can reasonably be substantiated, the rights of the tribes in the fisheries. A report by the Legal Adviser to this Office on the questions of law raised in the Government of India’s Despatch is enclosed, and Mr. Brodrick would suggest that the matter should be submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown with a view to ascertain the extent to which the Government of India might be authorised to intervene against interlopers, whether foreigners or British subjects, should the necessity arise. There can be no question, in Mr. Brodriek’s opinion, of the extreme desirability of securing to the tribes in the future the monopoly which they have hitherto enjoyed. The material facts may be stated as follows :— 1 . The pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. They extend, as shown on the charts enclosed with the Govern ment of India’s Despatch, from Umm-ul-Kawain to near the head of the Gulf. His Majesty’s Government lias agreements with the Arab Chiefs of Ras-al-Khaimah, Umm-al-Kawain, Ajman, Shargah, Dehai, Abu Dthabi and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs have practically surrendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The question of making a similar agreement with the Sheikh of El Katr is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. North of Bahrein the sovereignty over the western shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territories of the Sheikh of Koweit, whose special relations with His Majesty’s Government are known to the Secretary ol State lor Foreign Affairs.2 . Apparently all the tribes fish for pearls wherever they are to he found, and no tribe has exercised a right excluding the other tribes from any part of the fishery. 3. Only members of the tribes have hitherto fished for pearls in the waters. 4&lt;. — (a) Portions of some of the pearl banks lie within the three-mile territorial limit. (b) Some of the banks extend from within the three-mile territorial limit outwards for several miles. (c) Some of the pearl banks are entirely outside the three-mile territorial limit. Tn all these cases the tribes have exercised an exclusive right for fishing for pearls. 5. The tribes have not fished for pearls in the deep waters off the hanks, having no appliances for deep water fishing. It is apprehended that diving for pearls in such deep waters would materially injure the pearl fishery on the banks, and it is desired, if possible, to prevent dredging in such deep waters. 6 . The action to be taken for the protection of the pearl fishery would appear to depend on ( 1 ) the legal right of the tribes to a monopoly, and (2) the power of the British Government to act on their behalf. It is conceived that some precise delegation of authority to the British Government to act on behalf of the tribes in this matter would be necessary. 7. The Law Officers would probably advi-e as to the legal rights of the tribes within and also without the three-mile territorial limit, and as to the nature and extent of the delegation to be obtained, and further as to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. I have, &amp;e., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Eoreign Office. Annex. Report by the Legal Adviser to the India Office, dated 12th April 1904. Two distinct questions are raised in the Despatch of the Government of India. 1 . First, there is the question whether the British Government is in a position to assert and vindicate the rights possessed by the Chiefs over the waters which adjoin their territories. This, it seems to me, is a question of fact. If it is correct to say that the Chiefs have all agreed to leave the protection of their interests in the hands of the British Government, then the existence or non-existence of a treaty defining their relations or imposing on the Government the obligation of affording that protection does not seem to me material. So long as anv act done by officers of the Government can he proved to have been done under the authority of the Chiefs whose territory may he concerned, then those officers have, I think, a complete defence (see Carr v. Times, 1902, A.C. 176). Nor do I think that any foreign State could complain of such an act, provided of course that it was an act which, if done by the Chief himself, would not have transgressed the rules of Internationaf law. 2. As regards the extent of the jurisdiction of a State beyond the limits of its own shores, I do not think I can do better than cite the opinion of the Law Officers of the Government of India in the case of the Mergui pearl fisheries, that opinion having been approved by the Law Officers of the Crown. They wrote as' follows : “ We are of “ opinion that the British Government possesses territorial jurisdiction “ over the sea within a belt or zone of three miles from the shores of« n ‘ the mainland of tlie provinces of Zeh, Tavoy, Mergui, and Tenasserim, &lt;c and of tlie islands appertaining thereto, including the Mergui “ Archipelago; as also over all bays, gulfs, and estuaries inter fauces terra, whether of such mainland or islands, hut no further.” While adopting the opinion as correct, the Law Officers of the Crown add, with reference to the Australian and Ceylon fisheries : “ The Australian “ Pearl Pishery Acts are limited in their operation to British subjects, “ and we assume that, in the case of the pearl fisheries in the Mergui “ Archipelago, there has not been, as in the case of the Ceylon fisheries, an immemorial claim to the pearl-oyster fishery beyond the usual “ territorial waters asserted by successive rulers and acquiesced in.” {See Revenue, Statistics, and Commerce Papers, 1893, December.) This opinion, it is to be observed, was given after the publication of the award in the Behring Sea Arbitration, which took place in August of the same year. In that arbir,ration a claim similar to that suggested in the sixth paragraph of the Despatch was put forward on behalf of the United States ; it was met by strong arguments on-behalf of the British Government [see Chapter VIII. of British Case and Argument, p. 36), and was negatived by the award. With regard to the Ceylon precedent, which among others was relied on by the United States in support of their claim to a right of some sort extending beyond the three-mile limit, it is pointed out in the argument that these fisheries “ have been “ treated from time immemorial by the successive rulers of the Island “ as subjects of property and jurisdiction, and have been so regarded “with the acquiescence of all other nations.” The Ceylon case thus stated is, in fact, one which illustrates the proposition that a portion of the high sea may be appropriated by dint of actual occupation in the same way as land may bo so occupied. If a similar assertion of owner ship and acquiescence could be proved with regard to the fisheries in the Persian Gulf outside the three-mile limit, I think those fisheries would be taken to be included within the territory of the State to which they are contiguous. Otherwise, the three-mile limit must prevail, for that is the rule which a State is supposed to adopt in the absence of express notice that a larger extent is claimed {see Hall on International Law, p. 154). In order to apply the above principles to the case of any particular fishing ground (for I presume there are distinct fishing grounds), it may be necessary to institute a more detailed inquiry than has already been made, so that it may be decided whether in that particular case it is expedient to assert a claim by right of occupation larger than that which the ordinary rule would justify.

The Government of India have called the attention of His Majesty’s Government in the annexed letter to the fact that by the steps they have consistently taken for more than a century to maintain the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf, they have deprived the Arab Chiefs on the coast of the means of forcibly protecting their interests in the pearl fisheries, and that they therefore feel themselves to be under an obligation to defend those rights in so far as they can reasonably be substantiated. They cite instances in the past in which they have have successfully intervened to prevent the intrusion both of foreigners, by diplomatic means, and of British subjects. They recognise, however, that the position is difficult, both in regard to British subjects and from the point of view of international law. They therefore desire to ascertain the extent to which they may be authorised to intervene, should the necessity arise.pfc The material facts may be stated as follows :— 1. The pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Bahrein. They extend, as shown on the charts enclosed with the Government of India’s letter, from Um-ul- Kawain to near the head of the Gulf. His Majesty’s Government has identical agreements with the Arab Chiefs of Ras-ul-Khaimah, Um-ul- Kawain, A jman, Shargah, Debai, Abu Dthabi and Bahrein, hy which the Chiefs have practically surrendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The territory of these Chiefs comprises the Arabian coast of the Gulf off which the pearl banks lie up to the island of Bahrein, with the exception of the promontory of El Katr, with whose Chief the question of making a similar agreement is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. North of Bahrein the sovereignty over the Arabian shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit, who has special relations with His Majesty s Government. 2. Apparently all the tribes fish for pearls wherever they are to_ be found ; and no tribe has exercised a right excluding the other tribes from any part of the fishery. 3. Only members of the tribes have hitherto fished lor pearls in these waters. 4. («) Portions of some of the pearl banks lie within the three-mile territorial limit. (b) Some of the banks extend from within the three-mile limit outwards for several miles. (&lt;?) Some of the banks are entirely outside the three-mile limit. In all these cases the tribes have exercised an exclusive and concurrent right of fishing for pearls. ^ n. The tribes have not fished for pearls in the deep waters off the oanks, having no appliances for deep water fishing. It is apprehended that dredging for pearls in such deep waters would materially injure the pearf fishery on the banks ; and it is desired, if possible, to prevent dredging in such deep Avaters. 6 . The action to be taken for the protection of the pearl fishery would appear to depend on ( 1 ) the legal right of the tribes to a monopoly ; and (2) the power of the British Government to act on their behalf in maintaining that monopoly. It is conceived that some precise delegation of authority to the British Government to act on behalf of the tribes in this matter would be necessary. It must be added that none of the tribes have any judicial system or courts of law for dealing with trespassers or trespassing boats. 7. The Law Officers might be asked to advise as to the legal rights of the tribes within, and also wdthout, the three-mile territorial limit; and as to the nature and extent of the delegation to be obtained; and, further, as to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances.

Foreign Office, Gentlemen, 19th October 1904. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, by direction of the Marquess of Lansdowne, the papers noted in the accompanying list, relative to the question of the steps to he taken to pr went foreign interference with the rights enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf in the pearl fisheries. It will he observed, from the India Office letter of the 30th June (Annex Ah that the Government of India have called the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the fact that, by the steps they have con sistently taken for rao'e than a century to maintain the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf, they have deprived the Arab Chiefs on the coast of the means of forcibly protecting their interests in the pearl fisheries, and that they therefore feel themselves to be under an obligation to defend those lights in so far as they can reasonably be substantiated.

The pearl fishery hanks lie off the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf, and off the coast of Bahrein. They extend, as shown on the charts (Annex B), inclosed with the Government of India’s letter, from TJm-ul-Kawain to near the head of the Guif. His Majesty’s Govern ment have identical agreements (Annex C) with the Arab Chiefs of Bas-ul-Khaimah, Um-ul-Kawain, Ajman, Shargah, Debai, Abu Dthabi, and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs have practically surrendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The terri tory of these Chiefs comprises the Arabian coast of the Gulf off which the pearl banks lie up to the island of Bahrein, with the exception of the promontory of El Katr, with whose Chief the question of making a similar agreement is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. North of Bahrein, the sovereignty over the Arabian shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit, who has special relations with His Majesty’s Government. 2 .

It might also be practicable—whether it should bo done or not is a matter of policy-to raise the question in a form suitable for decision by the Hague Tribunal.

I ^ My Lord:- We were honoured with Your Lordship’s com mands signified in Sir Eldon Gorst’s letter of the 19th October last transmitting to us the accompanying papers relative to the question of the steps to be taken to prevent foreign interference with the rights enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian Coast of the Per sian Gulf in the Pearl fisheries, and requesting us to favour Your Lordship with our opinion:- 1. As to the legal rights of the tribes within, as also without, the three-mile territorial 1 imit. 2. As to the procedure to be followed in i expelling interlopers and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. We have taken the matter into our considera tion, and, in obedience to Your Lordship’s coirmands, have the honour to REPORT The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c ,, &amp;c ., &amp;c., I 1— 1* THAT the tribes have a right to the .exclu sive use of the pearl fisheries within the three- mile limit and in any other waters which may justly be considered territorial. As regards the fisheries beyond territorial waters we think that a distinction must be drawn between the banks where the tribes have practised r i-tfifliHi n ii'r i i iV-'-'f pearl fishing and the deep waters in which no such fishery has been carried on by them. As regards the.pearl banks, we think that, as a matter of International Law, they are capable of being the property of the tribes to the exclusion of all other Nations. In addition to the. passage cited from Vattel, reference may be made to Puffen- dorfs Treatise w de jure Naturae et gentium* Book IV, Chapter V section 7 and to the recent work of Professor Westlake * International Law* Part I Chap ter 9 at pages 186 and 187, and the case of the pro tection of the Ceylon pearl banks is a striking il lustration of the assertion of this right in prac ticepractice. Whether such rights - in fact - exist with regard to these particular pearl banks in the Persian Gulf is a question the answer to which cannot be given with any certainty as it depends on the evidence available of historical facts with reference to the enjoyment of these fisheries by the tribes and the ex clusion of others from them. As far as we can judge f upon the materials before us f we think that there are grounds for asserting the existence of such an exclu sive right t and we do not think that - in point of law - the fact that the enjoyment was by the tribes in common would prevent the acquisition of the right in question. Having regard to the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the tribes on the west shore of the Persian Gulf, we think that the existence of this exclusive right may be properly maintained on their behalf by His Majesty’s Government. With regard to the deep waters in which pearl fishing has not been carried on by the tribes we think the case is different. There is here no defined area at the bottom of the sea over which the right of fishfishing has been exercised to the exclusion of other Nations as there is sorb ground for saying was the case with regard to the pearl banks. We cannot see that the right claimed by the tribes to exclude other Nations from these deeper waters could be as serted with any reasonable chance of success. 2. Having regard to the importance of protect ing the deeper waters and to the fact that for the reasons above indicated it cannot be regarded as certain that the right - even to the pearl tanks - could be established to the satisfaction of any in ternational tribunal, we think that it would be pre ferable to discourage foreign interference by re- xiising supplies &amp;c., as suggested in the papers be- xore us. If such measures prove inadequate it may be necessary, having obtained the authority of the jl **«*&gt;' iM **'* ;• Chiefs for this purpose, to compel the remo val of vessels engaged in fishing on the pearl banks. Of course, measures of this kind must be taken with caution as international complications might result fromfrom any precipitate action. It might also be prac ticable - whether it should be done or not is a mat ter of policy - to raise the question in a form suit able for decision by the Hague Tribunal. Fishing within the territorial waters may, of course, be prevented. Generally. We desire to add that, having regard to the importance of the question to the tribes and the fact that we cannot be certain of establishing the right claimed, it is probably desirable that the fish ing by foreigners should, if possible, be indirectly stopped without raising the question internationally.

SECRET. External. No. 63, DATED THE 10TH MARCH 1904. Letter to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Pearl-fisheries in the Persian Gulf. Eoraign Office Press—No. 556—9-3-04—14.No. 63 of 1904. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. To FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Fort William, the 10th March 1904. Sir, In the course of our recent examination of problems connected with the Persian Gulf, the question of the pearl-fisheries that have so long existed there has come under our notice. Important questions, both of policy and international law, are involved; and although none of these has fortunately hitherto assumed an acute shape, it seems to us desirable that the matter should he considered now, in order that we may know how to act should any sudden or unexpected development occur. We, therefore, address you on the subject. 2. The approximate limits of the pearling grounds in the neighbourhood of the Arab littoral are indicated on the enclosed copy of a chart of the Gulf. In addition to those marked, there are also shoals in the neighbourhood of Kharak Island and at other points along the Persian coast, which are regularly exploited and frequently yield considerable returns. We are j immediately concerned, however, only with those lying on the Arabian side I of the Gulf. Along this coast lie the territories of the several Trucial Chiefs, the peninsula of El Katr, the island of Bahrein, the Turkish province of El Hassa, and the domains of the Sheikh of Koweit. The pearl banks appear from time immemorial to have been open, without distinction, to the Arabs of the entire littoral; and though there are no definite inter-tribal limits, the external boundaries of the fisheries are well known. Intrusion is resented ; the principal Chiefs have in the past expressed the view that the fisheries are common property, and that no Chief has, therefore, the right to grant any concession to outside parties; and believing as they do that the shallower waters are dependent on the deeper for their supply of shells, their objections relate not only to interference on the shoals which are habitually fished by their dependents, but also to the exploitation of the deeper waters beyond. 3. His Majesty’s Government are aware of the close relations which exist between the Arabs of this coast and the Indian Government. Since 1813 we have held from the Trucial Chiefs agreements to refrain from any breach of the peace at sea and in 1892 the Sheikhs concluded fresh compacts binding themselves not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; not to consent, except with the permission of the British Government to the residence within their territories of the Agent of any other State • and not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give occupation of any portion of their terXries, save to the British Government. In respect of El Katr we have at present no formal Conventions. We have declined, however, to recognise Turkish pretensions on thfe peninsula, and the leading Chief has on more than one occasion approached our officers in the Gulf with a request that he may be admitted to closer relations with the Indian Government. Bahrein has for long been, to all intents and purposes, a British protectorate ; while in the case of Koweit though the Turks have laid claim to certain ill-defined rights of sovereignty we have always asserted that the Sheikh enjoys a large measure of practical independence, and His Majesty’s Government have promised him their good offices. The maintenance of the maritime peace in the Gull is an2 D object which for more than a century past we have steadily kept in view in all our dealings with the Arab tribes. To secure this object we have prohibited the use of armed boats by the Chiefs, and have taken upon ourselves the duty of policing all these waters. A necessary corollary of this policy is that the Chiefs cannot themselves adopt forcible measures for the preservation of their monopoly in connection with the pearl-fisheries. It is clear, therefore, tha^** we on our part owe to them an obligation to defend their rights so far as they can reasonably be substantiated. This duty carries with it incidentally the advantage that, if our right to police the pearl banks is recognised, a large area of the Gulf becomes at once practically British waters. 4. In the past w^e have on more than one occasion intervened to prevent the intrusion of foreigners. In 1863 a British steamer appeared in the Gulf with trained divers and scientific appliances, but the steps which were at once taken by the Resident, with the approval of the Bombay Government, sufficed to frustrate the attempted encroachment. In 1874, and again in 1890, His Majesty’s Government, on the advice of the Government of India, declined to counte nance proposals made by British companies to exploit the fisheries. In 1894 support was refused to an application by a British subject to the Persian Government for pearling concessions in the Gulf. In 1899, in connection with the alleged grant of certain privileges to two Europeans by the Persian Government, the Mushir-ed-Dowleh was informed by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that no contract could be recognised which would have the effect of interfering with the rights exercised by Chiefs under British protection. In 1901 Sir Nicolas O’Conor, hearing of a project which was under the considera tion of the Porte to tax the fisheries, acquainted Tewfik Pasha with the objections which Her late Majesty’s Government saw to any action which would interfere with the prescriptive rights of our protected tribes. In 1902 our local officers declined to countenance the project of a British Indian subject, who proposed to obtain facilities for pearling in Abu Dhabi waters. Finally, in 1903, Colonel Kemball reported that two Frenchmen, named Dumas and Castelin, had arrive! in Bahrein with the intention of prospecting the pearl banks round that island. The Chief refused to entertain their proposals, and subsequently the strangers left the neighbourhood, one for Turkish Arabia, and the other for Europe, where it was believed that he intended to engage a pioressional diver. He has, however, not yet re-appeared. In connection with the last-mentioned case, we have informed our Political Resident in the Persian ult that we entirely approve Sheikh Esa’s attitude, and that, in the event of either o± these Frenchmen returning to Bahrein, the Chief should refuse to render assistance of any description ; that any other Chief who may be similarly approached should return a similar response ;‘and that the Government of India s ould at once be informed of any renewal of the project or of any like on this s ^ eile l ose &gt; ^ or y 0ur information, a copy of the recent correspondence . We have thus succeeded, hitherto, in staving off outside interference. /I’m ncwGver, that our position in the matter is in certain respects 1 ™ that m the future the same success may not attend measures w nc m e past have sufficed to attain our object. The question involves considerations, firstly, of private, and, secondly, of international law. Our rig s in restraining foreign interference are, it appears to us, at any rate commensurate with those^ of the Arab tribes concerned, since these have agree o eave the protection of their interests in our hands; and the question w ic we may hereafter be called upon to answer, whether in defending a n 1 V 1 ±w SU1 m a '^ ri ^ ls * 1 Court or in meeting an international claim, must ■» 0 + , e S ? m ^’ ^ he ex tent of the rights and jurisdiction possessed y e Arab Chiefs. The chart which we enclose shows that the pearl banks extend to considerable distances from the mainland or from any n an ’ 4 . 1 j ln i 0 ,, ^' m ^ e limit it seems evident that no difficulty need e encountered, and that the rights over the pearl banks and the jurisdiction required to assert those rights are indisputable. Beyond this zone, however, e case is ess clear. We^ understand that it has become an uncontested prmcip e o mo ern international law that the sea, as a general rule, cannot be f ] 1 f 60 V a Pffi’ 0 P na l 10n - At the same time we believe that it is admitted sea may be affected by proprietary rights on the part of ates whose territories it adjoins, and that such rights have been moreespecially recognised in the case of fisheries, to which the inhabitants of a neighbouring State have established a claim through immemorial exercise of the right of fishing. There can be no doubt that the rights of which they now claim the exclusive enjoyment have been exercised by the Arabs of these coasts from time immemorial; and we consider, therefore, that the S^jjact of these fisheries being in part outside the limits of territorial waters '' 0 ,veed not necessarily constitute a conclusive bar to the claim. In the pearl- fisheries of Ceylon we have a precedent for the exercise of jurisdiction beyond the 3-mile limit under the Colonial Act of 1811, which authorises the seizure and condemnation of any boat found within the limits of, or hovering near, the pearl banks extending from 6 to 21 miles from tlm coast; and it may be observed that, in the recent Behring Sea Arbitration, the United States of America cited the Ceylon precedent as justifying their exercise of possession in, and control over, se?»l-fisheries beyond the zone of territorial waters as ordinarily recognised by international law. It is also worth noting that the above contention is supported by the authority of the Swiss publicist, Yattel, who in his “ Droit des Gens ” remarked, in discussing the question as far back as the eighteenth century, “ Qui doutera que les pecheries de perles de Bahrein et de Ceylon ne puissent legitimement tomber en propriete ? We believe, therefore, that our claim to exclude all foreign pearling vessels from the /; limits of the fisheries at present worked by the tribes within our protectorate might, if challenged, be defended with a reasonable chance of success. 6 . There remains, however, the case of foreign exploitation of deep waters outside the sphere in which we believe that it may be shown that immemorial usage and occupation have conferred prescriptive rights. In this still wider area we doubt whether we possess claims in support of which we could appeal to any law or international practice, and we fear that possible detriment to the pearl banks in which we hold prescriptive rights would furnish no valid ground for objecting to legitimate foreign enterprise outside the sphere of Arab occupation ; but by authorising the Chiefs to abstain from all intercourse with such inter lopers and to utilise the powers which they possess of interdicting the importa tion of foreign diving appliances, of refusing to lend any assistance in men, boats or in any other form, or, if necessary in the last resort, of removing any such foreigner from their territories, we might succeed in putting such seiious impediments in the way of such enterprises as would discourage outsiders from engaging in them. 7. The question is fortunately not one in which we are at present called upon to decide as to the exact nature of the rights or the ^ precise limits of the jurisdiction which the several Chiefs possess, and which we, as the Paramount Power, are bound to assert and maintain on their behalf ; but in view of the possibility of further attempts, whether by British companies or by foreign capitalists, we think it advisable to be prepared in advance. We shall, therefore, be glad to know whether His Majesty’s Government concur in the views above set forth, and to receive any instructions which it may be deemed advisable to issue for the guidance of our local officers in the event of renewed adventures of a more determined character.

In continuation of my letter No. 33, dated 2nd March, on the subject of the two Frenchmen, who have recently arrived in Bahrein, I have the honour to report that I have heard from the Assistant Political Agent that, on the 1st instant, Mons. Dumas wrote to him and asked him to introduce him to the Chief of Bahrein. Mr. Gaskin intended to visit the Chief on the 6 th instant, and took Mons. Dumas with him. At the interview only the ordinary compli ments were exchanged. Mr. Gaskin further reports that Mons. Dumas had made enquiries from him as to whether the Chief levied any taxes on pearl diving, and that, in reply, he took the opportunity of letting him know that the Arabs residing on the coast from Koweit southwards depended upon the pearl diving for their livelihood, and that any interference by foreigners with the pearl banks would be attended with great personal risk. Mons. Dumas, who speaks English fairly well, thereupon said that, under the circumstances, he would not attempt to engage in any pearl diving operations. The Assistant Political Agent states that the two Frenchmen brought 42 packages with them, and that these packages were examined in the Customs, and were found to contain furniture, articles for domestic use, provisions, and samples of cloths, velvets, gold embroideries, soaps, and perfumery. Mons. Castelin, the Assistant of Mons. Dumas, is said to be an Engineer by profes sion. Mons. Dumas informed the Assistant Political Agent that he was induced to come to Bahrein on account of an order which he had received from a firm in Paris for the purchase of any quantity of shells up to 10,000 tons, and of another order given him by another firm for a large quantity of birds’ skins. Mr. Gaskin is inclined to believe that they have come to Bahrein for purposes of trade only. They have taken a house in Bahrein for six months on a monthly rental of Rs. 60. The French Vice-Consul at Bushire has heard from them of their arrival in Bahrein.[Confidential.] No. 49 , dated Bushire, the 26 th March 1903 . From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. KeMball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, To—L. W. Dane, Esq., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to my letter No. 39, dated 16th March, I have the honor to report that Monsieur Joseph Dumas, who had arrived in Bushire from Bahrein on the 24th instant, called on me yesterday bearing a letter of introduction from the French Vice-Consul at Bushire. Apparently he wished for assistance from me. After assuring me that he had no political motives for coming to Bahrein, he broached the question of pearl diving. He said that he understood from people in Bahrein that fishing for pearls was open to all, and he said that he proposed to embark in the enterprise. He said that he knew that if he approached the Chief of Bahrein on the subject, the Chief would refer him to the Assistant Political Agent, who would refer him to me, and he had therefore come to me. He had no desire to infringe the rights of the native pearl divers, but proposed to operate in waters where the native divers having no mechanical diving appliances could not work. I explained to Monsieur Dumas that the pearl banks were the common property of the coast Arabs and that the Chief of Bahrein had no right to give any one permission to take part in the diving operations ; that although he, Monsieur Dumas, might say that his operations carried on in the deep waters would not in any way affect the pearl banks where the natives dived, the Arabs themselves would probably not share such an opinion, and I had little doubt that the interference of foreigners armed with diving appliances would meet with the active opposition of the Arabs and would certainly be attended with great risk. 2.. Monsieur Dumas, then, referred to another enterprise which he had in his mind, namely, a steam-launch service for landing cargo in the Bahrein Harbour and conveying passengers between Manama and Muharrag. He said that he had not mentioned this project to any one in Bahrein as he feared that others might anticipate him and he wished to be first in the field. He asked me if I would assist him in the event of his being able to come to terms with the people who now manage the landing business. I replied that not knowing what his actual proposals were, I could not say anything to him definitely: but that in any case the matter would have to be decided by the Chief of Bahrein, who might possibly object to the inauguration of a system which would perhaps deprive some of his subjects, who owned the boats and employed labour, of their livelihood. If the Chief refused to entertain the proposal, I should not feel myself called upon to offer him any advice one way or the other. Monsieur Dumas was of the opinion that this scheme of his promised to be remunerative and he said that he would have no difficulty in procuring the requi site funds. He further said that he intended to go in for the shell business and that he was certain of obtaining a ready market for this commodity in France. 3. I trust that what I said to Monsieur Dumas will meet with the approval of the Government of India. The man gave me the impression of being an enterprising trader, ready to embark upon any scheme. I am inclined to believe that his main object in coming to Bahrein is connected with the pearl fisheries in the Gulf, and I think it probable that he may persist in his endeavours in this direction. With regard to his steam-launch scheme, the Chief will, of course, consult Mr. Gaskin, in the event of Monsieur Dumas propounding the scheme to him and Mr. Gaskin will submit the matter for my consideration.No. 69, dated Bushire, the 28th April 1903 (Confidential). * Foreign Office Press—No, 254—19-5-03—49.

Dumas frequently during my absence. I therefore sent after him a few days ago and gathered from his conversation that Mons. Dumas spoke to him on the subject of obtaining from the Chief a concession for pearl diving, and asked him to approach the latter with a view of ascertaining whether he will receive the proposal agreeably, and that he accordingly visited the Chief and informed him of Mons. Dumas’s wishes, but the Chief told him that it was not possible for him to grant such a concession. It would seem that Tikchand visited the Chief on Mons. Dumas’s behalf while I was away from here; and since the refusal of the Chief to entertain the proposal, Mons. Dumas has taken no further steps in the matter.

In continuation of the correspondence ending with my letter No. 69, dated 28th. April 1908, on the subject of the two Frenchmen who have recently arrived at Bahrein, and with reference to my telegram, dated 12 th instant, I have the honour to forward copy of a letter No. 82, dated 8 th instant, from the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, to my address. 2 . I have little doubt that Mons. Dumas’s primary object in coming to Bahrein was connected with the pearl-diving enterprise, and from the Assistant Political Agent’s letter it would appear that he now intends to take steps to give effect to the enterprise. It is, perhaps, doubtful if he will succeed in his endeavours to procure the services of a European diver and to obtain the necessary financial support in Europe, but the possibility of his success will have to be considered. 8 . Much correspondence has already taken place upon the subject ^ of European enterprise in connection with pearl-diving operations in the Persian Gulf, and the views and policy of His Majesty’s Government in discouraging such enterprise are well known. In the present instance, there is no question of any concession to be granted by the Persian or Turkish Government, but we have to consider the case of a French subject who having been warned of the personal risks which will be incurred by Europeans embarking upon pearling operations on or near the pearl banks of the Persian Gulf at the hands of the Coast Arabs who by long prescription consider these pearl banks to be their exclusive property, nevertheless intends to face these risks and to introduce European labour and modern diving appliances. 4. The Maritime Truce in the Gulf has been maintained for so long, and the tribes inhabiting the Arab Coast who participate in the pearl diving are so well aware of the wfill and power of His Majesty’s Government to preserve the peace at sea, that it is perhaps doubtful if a venture, like the one on which Mons. Dumas seems inclined to embark, would, at the present time, be attended with much actual risk. The Chiefs of the littoral would prooably be too apprehensive of the consequences to authorise any attack by^ their subjects upon Europeans operating on or near the pearl banks, and I think that, before proceeding to extreme measures, they would appeal to the Besident at Bushire and ask him to take the necessary steps to safeguard their interests. The position of the Besident would then be an extremely difiicult one: he could not well inform the Chiefs that the matter was one in which he did not see his way to interfere, and that they must take their own measures for protecting their rights, as this might be construed by the Chiefs as a permission to take the law into their own hands, and very serious consequences would possibly ensue : on the other hand, the Besident would have no right to prevent foreign subjects from diving for pearls anywhere within the high seas of the Persian Gulf. Possibly, British subjects might be lawfully restrained by British authority from doing so, and I am aware that so long ago as 1862 this was actually done, although the legality of the action then taken has always appeared doubtful to me. With regard, however, to subjects of foreign Powers, it is clear that the British Government can have no executive authority, unless, that is, the exclusive ownership of the pearl banks by the tribes of the littoral whose Chiefs are under Treaty engagements with the British Government can be maintained before all the world, 5. So much has already been written upon this subject that it seems unnecessary for me to say anything more. The matter, however, is of such great importance that I have thought it advisable to make a few remarks upon the general question, notwithstanding the fact that, in the particular case which forms the subject of this letter, it is not yet certain that Mons. Dumas’s plans will come to maturity. Meanwhile, it might be advisable that I should warn the Chief of Bahrein that he should not give Mons. Dumas or other2 Europeans any facilities whatever towards obtaining boats or divers at Bahrein. This will possibly have the desired effect, if Mons. Dumas intends to start operations with local boats and labour, and I shall be glad to hear if this suggestion, inadequate as it seems, meets with the approval of the Government 1 - 1 -p 1 t-w-Itq f No. 82, dated Bahrein, the 8 th May 1903. From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, To —Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my confidential letter No. 58, dated tlie 19th April 1903, I have the honour to report that it appears that Mons. Dumas has sent his Assistant, Mons. Castelin, to France with a view to engage, if possible, a . European diver and to purchase a diving machine for the puipose of carrying i on diving operations in the Persian Gulf. Messieurs Dumas and Castelin called on me on the 6 th instant, and the former told me that Mons. Castelin was going by the mail steamer to Bombay en route to Marseilles, owing to receiving news of the illness of his father. M hen I asked whether Mons. Castelin would be returning to Bahrein, Mons. Dumas merely said “perhaps”. Mons. Castelin left by the S.S. “Kerbela on the 7th instant. Air. Zwemer called on me on Thursday, and amongst other things he told me that Mons. Dumas has stated to him that Alons. Castelin was going to France for the purpose of finding a European diver who would he willing to work in the Persian Gulf, and to buy a diving machine for employment in the firm’s venture. It would seem that, notwithstanding the imminent danger which he has been informed he will be running in the event of his engaging in pearling operations with modern appliance, Alons. Dumas evidently intends to make the attempt should Alons. Castelin succeed in engaging a diver willing to come out to the Gulf. In this matter I believe Alons. Dumas has the support of a large French firm, and probably has also received encouragement from the j f French Government. The capital of Alons. Dumas’s firm, I understand, is small, and the risk of the venture being great, I cannot think that he would enter into it without the assistance of some influential firm and receiving assurance of protection from his Government. It is quite possible that Alons. Dumas may succeed in his venture by hiring an impecunious Nacoda at a tempting salary to take the pearling party to the prolific banks and a number of armed Arabs for their protection against molestation. Such measures, aided by the support of his Government, ought to make the venture a success. If this scheme is permitted to mature, the British Syndicates who were formerly discouraged by His Alajesty’s Government from undertaking pearling operations in the Persian Gulf will have a just cause for complaining of having received improper treatment, and, finally, British firms will have to he allowed to share in the operations in the Gulf and given similar support. The German firm established in Lingah and Bahrein will certainly follow the example of the Frenchman if he is not checked. Now that the subjects of other European Powers are giving their attention F to the Persian Gulf pearl hanks, the time has arrived for coming to some understanding with the Powers concerned to have the pearl banks closed for the exclusive benefit of the indigent inhabitants of the Persian Gulf littoral.

NO. 1. The Hon. the Colonial Secretary to Sir W. C. Twynam, K.C.M.G, Colonial Secretary’s Oliice, Colombo, May 6 , 1899. SIR,— I AM directed by the Lieutenant-Governor to transmit to you the accompanying copy of Captain Donnan’s report on the inspection of the Pearl Banks on the west coast lying off Arippu, Karativu, and Chilaw, and to state that His Excellency will feel much obliged for any advice which you may be able to give the Government in the matter. 2 . I am at the same time to forward to you for reference the accompanying copies of reports made by Mr. Holdsworth in 1867 and 1868 on the Pearl Oyster Banks. 3. I am to request that these reports may be returned when you have finished with them. I am, &amp;c., H. L. CRAWFORD, for Colonial Secretary. No. 40. Enclosure. The Master Attendant, Colombo, to the Hon. the Colonial Secretary. Master Attendant’s Office, Colombo, April 14, 1899. I have the honour to report my return to Colombo on the 13th instant from an inspection’of the Pearl Banks on the west coast lying off Arippu, Karativu, and Chilaw. 2. The banks examined off Arippu were the Cheval Paar, Modragam Paar, southern portion of the Periya Paar, Periya Paar Kerai, Centre Yankalai Paar, Kallatidal Paar, Kondatchy Paar, and Jakenpiddi Paar. . ^ ^ ^ 3. Large beds of young oysters from three to six months old were found on the Periya Paar and on the Centre Yankalai Paar, but no oysters whatever were found on any of the other banks. The few small patches of young oysters that were found on the east side of Cheval Paar last year have entirely disappeared. , ^ J _ _ r _ T r ™ a, xi 4. The banks examined off Karativu were the Dutch Modragam, Karativu Paar, Alanthura Paar and Muttuvarattu Paar. No oysters were found on the Dutch Modragam, Karativu, and Alanthura Paars. The Muttuvarattu Paar, which was so promising two years ago, I regret to report failed completely. During the two days employed in going caiefully ovei this bank, only 120 oysters of two to three and a half years old were found, so that practically the 72 million of young oysters estimated to be on this bank in March, 1897, have completely disappeared. I had to report last year a very laro’e reduction in the number of oysters on this bank, but X then hoped that the oysters left, beino'older and stronger to resist attacks of fish, would remain on the bank and come to maturity. The only evidence found of the cause of the disappearance of some of the ojsteis was that of a few of the empty shells sent up by the divers having a piece broken off them, laige enough to have caused the death of the ovster; and it seemed to me that the pieces had been bitten off the shells by some fish. Th'ere were not however many of the empty shells damaged in that way. Out of a total of 5o picked up there were only 5 damaged ; the remaining 50 were perfect and showed no sign of the cause of death of the oyster. The bulk of the oysters, however, must have been removed from the bank entirely, otherwise many more empty shells would have been found, and therefoie the cause of t leir removal remains a mystery. It is probable, however, that they might have been removed entirely by large fish, such as skate, which would crush the shells in their mouth and swallow the fragments of shell along with the oyster. I have found the stomachs of rock fish of 10 to 15 lb. m weight, that have been caught on a bed of young oysters, full of fragments of the young oyster shells and if such fish swallow the oyster shell it is very probable that larger fish, able to crush the shell of older oysters, would ^ n 1 ^ e ™^ ined off ohilaw were the Udapankare Paar, Muthubundi Paar, Jakenpiddi Paar, Karukupany Paar, Chilaw Paar, Wanathy Paar, and Urugul Paar. No oysters however were found on any of these banks. I am, &amp;c., J. DONNAN, Master Attendant. 80-02m ( 2 ) No. 2. Sir W C. Twynam, K.C.M.G., to the Hon. the Colonial Secretary.

To these I shall refer hereafter. In all my diaries of the inspections I have made with Captain Donnan, Captain Leighton, and bv mvself, and in the diaries of the pearl fisheries, I have endeavoured to record for the information of Government all my experiences, every scrap of information I have obtained from divers and others and whatever fell under my own observation ; and in my reports on fisheries and inspections I have fully stated the opinions and conclusions I had arrived at, from what I had seen and heard and from what had occurred. . On reference to my reports and diaries I find little to modify in the opinions and conclusions I arrived at at the time and in the suggestions I made, and that little only in regard to the steps to be taken to efficiently watch the pearl banks and carry out inspections. It will be seen that I shall say very little (if anything) that is new, and for the most part I shall only repeat what has been stated before and pressed on the attention of Government by officers who have worked as Superintendents and Inspectors, and the Supervisor of the Pearl Banks or»H thfi Piaberies. and bv mvself. and I shall more especiallv invite attention to some extracts from Mr. Thomas’s report on the Fisheries of Tuticorin. In support of the conclusions I have come to and the suggestions I have made and may make, and in order to show the grounds on which I have formed my opinions, I give in the form of an appendix (for facility of reference) extracts from my diaries and reports, and on certain points extracts from the reports of Mr. Yane and Captain Donnan, from Captain Steuart’s “Account of the Pearl Fisheries,” and from Mr. Thomas’s report of the Tuticorin Fisheries made to the Madras Govern ment. From Mr. Thomas’s report I append a very important extract regarding “ false spat,” to which I shall have to refer hereafter, and to Avhich I shall have to invite special attention. So far by way of preface. Disappearance of Oysters from Cheval and Muttuvarattu Paars. — March, 1899. First .—As regards the disappearance of young oysters from the Cheval and Muttuvarattu banks, I have to submit that it was not a matter of surprise to me to hear of this, holding as I do the opinion that floods of foul, muddy, and impure water discharged into the sea by four rivers are injurious to the pearl oysters, and to the opinion held by all who have had experience of the pearl banks of the effect of “ current.” Captain Donnan does not admit that the flood waters in abnormally heavy floods reach the pearl banks and do any injury, although he admitted to Mr. Thomas that water fouled in any way was injurious to the pearl oyster, which delights in clear, pure, salt water.Captain Donnan has stated that the Muttuvarattu Paar is peculiarly liable to injury from current. Flood and current can be taken, I think, to account for the disappearance of the oysters, and there was both flood and current during the season from beginning of December, 1.898, to the end of January, 1899. I arrived in Colombo on my return from England on the 8 th January, and was told there had been abnormally heavy rains in the north, north-west, and east. I obtained per mission to come to Jaffna in an immigrant brig. We were some days beating up to Paumben against a strong current, and were detained over a week in Paumben by a strong current through the channel. There was heavy rain in Paumben, and I was told also in Jaffna, so late as the 20th January—“a thing almost unprecedented.” When beating up to Paumben, in one of the tacks towards Ceylon, we made the land near Talavillu (near St. Anna’s). Talavillu is not very far from the Muttuva rattu Paar, and I then remarked to a lady in the ship and to thetindal that “ if Captain Donnan makes an inspection of the banks this year I should not wonder if he finds the oysters gone.” I believed at the time that the flood and current might injuriously affect them. I may be wrong in the opinion I hold, but I shall show hereafter that there have been three disappearances of oysters, in connection with two of which floods had, I believe, a great deal to do, and current and flood with the other. It is highly probable, as suggested by Captain Donnan, that skates and other fish preyed on the oysters to some extent. From the experiences* of 1863 and 1864 of what occurred on the Cheval bank, 1 believe that skates are attracted to a bank when the oysters are dying out, just as jackals and vultures are to a carcase. Captain Donnan, in his report on the inspection of 1888,f on which the fishery of 1889 at Dutch Bay was decided on, remarked that the oysters, which he considered almost too young to be fished, were dying out, and it was advisable therefore to fish them, though too young. He also remarked as one of his reasons for urging the fishery that the bank was “ exposed to currents.” I do not know that this bank is more exposed to currents than other banks ; but it may be that currents from the north, north-east, and east may have greater effect over it than over the other banks, and this may be accounted for by the fact that the Muttuvarattu Paar, unlike the Cheval and Modaragam, which shelve gradually into deep water, dips suddenly into 13 and 15 fathoms on the west and south-west.J At the fishery of 1891, in a conversation I had with one of the chief divers (a Moorman of Keelakarai), he informed me that this sudden shelving of the bank into deep water rendered, it impossible for the divers to get at some oysters on that part of the bank, as they were afraid of being sucked into the deep water.§ The current from north-west, which swept over the Cheval in 1888 and carried off most of the oysters, did not appear to have affected the Muttuvarattu Paar, which yielded a fishery, as I have remarked, in 1889, and again in 1890 and 1891. “ False Spat.”} Before going further I think it as well to invite attention to a very serious misapprehension which has existed in regard to the spat of the pearl oyster, both in Ceylon and Tuticorin. This has been owing to ignorance of the nature of the 6&lt; real spat ” of the pearl oyster and to dependence in consequence on the erroneous ideas entertained regarding the spat of the oyster by the native divers and others, and whose statements were accepted as correct, and as the result of long experience by Superintendents and Inspectors who have been employed on the pearl banks. Until 1885 two small descriptions of shells, whose term of existence does not probably exceed twelve months, have been mistaken for the real spat of the pearl oyster, and the appearance of these shells adhering thickly to a species of weed^I floating on the sea and adhering to rock has been reported on many occasions (apparently) as the appearance of “ numbers of young oysters on the banks, and their disappearance (at a following inspection) as the “ disappearance of the oysters seen at the last inspection.” „ _ . . , , , „ Mr. Thomas of the Madras Civil Service, in his report|| (above referred to) pointed out tor the first time what this “false spat,” as he terms it, really was, Captain Phipps, Master Attendant o Tuticorin, having invited his attention to it, and having expressed his doubts as to its being the real pearl oyster spat. . „ , My first acquaintance with the “ false spat” was at the inspection of the banks''* m March, 1867, which I made with Captain Donnan in the hired steamer “ General Hevelock.” We were informed that it was “real oyster spat” by those who were supposed to know. The Naturalist, Mr. Holdsworth, who was with us, treated it as real oyster spat, and had a quantity of it put into an iron tank with holes bored in it, which he caused to be placed on the karatiyu shoal m J 3 fathoms of water, tt with the result, however (as might have been anticipated), that the tank, sunk into tne sand, was with difficulty discovered, at the inspection of 1868 full of sand and covered with sand and '' ee&lt;L Captain Donnan having gone to England on leave in 1867, I made the inspection in March, 1868, in a sailing ship, the “ Royal Eagle,” with a Mr. Leighton of the Merchant Service, who acted for Captain Donnan as Master Attendant and Inspector. We found that the so-called oyster spat,4 together with the weed, had disappeared from where it was in 1867, hut quantities of it were found on other parts of the banks. , . , , , -j n , . I entertained very serious doubts as to whether this was oyster spat at all, and so did Captain Leighton, and we accordingly wrote as follows in our report: The appearance last year on the principal bank (viz, the Cheval) of what the native divers declared to be young pearl oysters, in such myriads, raised hopes that the banks were about to be replenished, which however do hot seem likely just now to be realized, the shells, whatever they may have been, having disappeared together with the weed they were on from the whole extent of the bank as already stated. . . , Similar shells have appeared this year on other banks where none were found last year, lying as thick, though not over so large an extent of ground. * I II * See Appendix 5, A and B. f See Appendix 8, A and B. I See Chart attached to Appendix 7, E. § See Appendix 8, I), E, and (x. II See Appendix 1, A and B. Said to be Sargassum mlgare. ** See Appendix 6, B. ff See Appendix 6, A and Gr.

I have, &amp;c., W. C. TWYNAM, Superintendent. R. LEIGHTON, Inspector. The package of shells referred to ^vas, as suggested, sent by Government to Captain Steuart, who reported that they were the fourth sample sent to him, °^ e h ^ 1 Province^in 185Jone Power, who retired from the Civil Service as Government Agent of the Central Province m 1855, one by Captain Donnan, and one by the Naturalist, Mr Holdsworth. , Captain Steuart reported that they were the real spat of the pearl oyster. He wrote as follows :— . , „ . , Mv opinion that the shells* herewith returned are those of young pearl oysters is not merely founded on my own expm'ience^but on information gained from two generations of nat.ve Adapanars, or head fishermen, who had served under me and my predecessors. i'j 0 O It is true as mentioned in the report on the recent inspection of the pearl banks, that I have known extensive deposits of pearl oyster brood disappear from the banks. It occurred so often as to induce me to cease to entertain expectations of successful pearl fisheries until I found sufficient of two or three years old oysters remai^ banks to encourage such expectations, but sometimes even this disappeared. The cause of such disappea a c oysters from the banks has not been satisfactorily accounted for. I have, &amp;c, JAMES STEUART. His opinion was accepted as conclusive on the point, and up to 1885 the false spat was considered to be the real spat, notwithstanding the doubts entertained by Captain I hipps, myselt, Future Superintendents and rii/ 1. others I give in the appendixf Mr. Thomas’s report on this false spat. Inspectors should be warned not to mistake the false spat for real spat. From the reply of Captain Steuart to the reference made to him regarding the so-called iMe * 6 spat, read together with certain portions of his “ Account of the Pearl Fisheries, it is evident that he was more than once deceived by the appearance of false spat on the banks. Trusting to the informa tion given to us, as given to Captain Steuart before, by those who were supposed to know, Captain Donnan, Mr. Holdsworth (the Naturalist), and I mistook the false spat for real spat in a 8 b . io le doubts expressed in 1868 we received what was considered a conclusive reply to the effect that it was the real spat of the pearl oyster. _ . , In the same way the officers on the Tuticorin bank were deceived, as appears m Mr. Ihomass report. Captain Phipps had his doubts, but he had to yield to authority. Mr. Thomas writes as follows :— If these so-called young oysters were never jmung oysters at all, but short-lived aviculce of a small sort, then it is not at all surprising that they should disappear within a few months and be not found in the following y6^ r ) then the meaning of the statistics is not that the pearl oysters have been always mysteriously disappearing, but that they were never present at all, and we must go through the statistics again for those of a size about which there could have been no mistake. Here I may be allowed to say that I am not blaming Captain Phipps for this. On the contrary, I have shown that he stood alone in challenging their being oysters, but was authoritatively overruled, and having said his say he yielded to authority. I unfortunately have not in my collection any of the false spat or minute real spat. The latter I do not recollect having seen. The specimens brought to Ceylon (as remarked by Mr. Thomas) by Captain Phipps on his way to England and shown, I believe, to Captain Donnan, were not seen by me. Perhaps Captain Donnan has presented the Colombo Museum with specimens of both. Enemies of the Pearl Oysters. (See also Extracts from Mr. Thomas’s Report, Appendices C 1, C 2, C 3, and C 4.) Currents. Certain species of shellfish, fish, skates, &amp;c., are acknowledged enemies of the pearl oyster, and to these I add—“ Floods of fresh water from rivers.”^ It is generally admitted that banks of oysters are often injuriously affected by currents which at times either carry away the oysters (old and young) or cover the banks with sand, thus destroying them.§ Captain Steuart, in his “ Account of the Pearl Fishery,” remarked on the effects of and the injury done by currents. Captain Donnan has, as I have noted, reported that the Muttuvarattu bank is “ exposed to currents.” * See Appendix 6, E and F. f See Appendix 6, A and B. J See Appendix 1,0. § See Appendices 7, A 4 : 7 0; 7 D.Mr. Thomas has written somewhat at length on the injury done by currents to the Tuticorin banks, and points out that the Tuticorin banks are more liable to injury by currents than the Ceylon banks, which are more sheltered.* * * § The divers have reported more than once at inspections that portions of the banks were covered with sand washed over them during the south-west monsoon.t We have had one great experience of tjie effect of current over the banks in 1888, when nearly all the oysters were swept off the bank.J On a clear day with the sun shining into the water I have seen the sand on the banks ribbed as it were by the action (as I believe) of currents, the European diver in his statement to Captain Donnan to the contrary notwithstanding. Captain Donnan informed Mr. Thomas that the European diver told him the bottom was “dead flat.” On the Tuticorin banks, according to Mr. Thomas, the sand is washed up into deep ridges by the currents.* Fish, Skates, &amp;c. Of shellfish, fish, skates, &amp;c., the following have been accused of being enemies of the pearl oysters:— Chank—The chank of commerce {Turbinellapyrum). Horse chank {Pyrula carnaria) ; Tamil “ Kuthiramullu shanku.”§ Elephant chank (Murex regius) ; Tamil “ Anaimullu shanku.”§ Trigger fish {Batistes mitis, as given by Mr. Thomas as the specimen shown to him on the Tuticorin bank) ; Tamil “ Kilathi.”|| Skates {Trygon warnak, as given by Mr. Thomas as the one shown to him) ; Tamil “ Yuluvadi tirukkai.”1[ Suran {Modiola) ; Tamil “ Suran.”** To these Mr. Thomas adds “ crabs,” which he says cut the byssus of the oyster by which it adheres itself to the rock, &amp;c. Mr, Thomas, for reasons given, acquits the chank of commerce {Turbinella pyrum) of doing any injury to the oysters, although he admits Captain Donnan and Captain Phipps told him they had seen a chank eating an oyster. The divers to whom I spoke on the subject all said that this chank was an enemy of the oysters and destroyed many of them. Mr. Thomas, however, wrote as follows :— “The native divers hold stoutly, and I deem rightly, that it is innocuous to oysters and feeds on worms.” The elephant chank and the horse chank, Mr. Thomas says, are destructive to oysters, and are admitted to be so by the native divers. Captain Phipps confirmed the opinion of the native divers by saying that whenever the elephant chank was found with its young there was a large clearance of oysters all round it in a circle ; and added that whenever they came across it they carefully destroyed it and all its young, and that it was rare. Trigger Fish {Batistes mitis). Trigger fish (of which there are several varieties) is a species of rock fish ; the one shown to Mr. Thomas was the Batistes mitis) Mr. Thomas does not believe that the trigger fish does much injury, as its teeth are not fitted to cut into the shell of a mature oyster, although perhaps it may prey on young oysters to some oxtont Captain Steuart however (see page 9 of his “Account of the Pearl Fishery”) says he found ten pearls and pieces of oyster shell in one he opened ; and on page 79, in accounting for the disappearance of some oysters in 1836, which it was estimated would yield a fishery, he wrote as follows The causes of this great diminution in the quantity of oysters are attributable, among other circumstances, to the following facts :— /•j\ numerous rock fishes which abound on the Arippu banks feed on the oysters, and while the oysters are young and the shells tender the quantity devoured by these voracious fish must be very considerable, The seamen on board the Government ship “ Wellington, who are in the habit of catching these rock fish, commonly find pieces of pearl shells and even the flesh of the oysters in their stomachs, from whence they have some times extracted pearls. I found three pearls (one a very good one) and pieces of shell in the first one I opened. These instances of pearls being found in the trigger fish seem to go against Mr. Thomas’s idea that the trigger fish only preys on young oysters, as pearls of any size would not be found m young oysters^ Thomag on to gay that on Tuticorin banks the trigger fish, though it may prey on young oysters, is otherwise very useful, as it preys on and destroys the suran, and is perhaps more a friend than an enemy of the oysters. Suran {Modiol'a). A comparatively small shell (mussel), which spreads a sort of blanket over the oysters and suffocates them I have never seen the suran on the Ceylon banks.ff Captain Donnan came on some during the inspection of 1892 or 1893. He sent me a specimen, which I have in a bottle in my collec tion. It has I believe since disappeared. Captain Donnan was very much afraid at the time that it would spread over the Ceylon banks. , . . , , ,, Is the immunity of the Ceylon banks from this pest owing m any degree to the presence of the trio'gor fi sTi ^ I have already alluded to the crab as an enemy of the pearl oyster according to Mr. Thomas. * Spp Armpndix 1 C 5 t See Appendices 4, B 1 ; 6, D ; 6, G. t ThefeTno doubt a Verv strong wash over the Modragam and Cheval banks during the south-west monsoon.

He also said he saw the trigger fish making the round holes above referred to on the shell of the oyster. These and some other wonderful stones had to be swallowed ' rth a The*native^!dea is that snakes prey on the oysters. If the European diver is to be believed, he actually saw the snakes eating the oysters as reported by him on two occasions, and saw them darting their tongues into the oysters when lying with the valves open. There is no mention made of snakes in Mr Thomas’s report. There are several varieties on the Ceylon banks, and they are seen on he surface in numbers in March. Some of them are of large size and have powerful jaws and teeth. Some are very venomous.t Shellfish. There are I believe many enemies of the oyster in the shape of comparatively small shellfish, which I believe prey on them, though perhaps not to any serious extent. , „ The divers often bring up oyster shells perfectly bright with the hinges unbroken and small pieces of flesh adhering to the shell. Some animal had no doubt preyed on them. The native idea is that this was done by snakes.J , T ,, . , n . x-u ^ i. I believe from the experience Captain Donnan and I had on the bank during the fishery in 1874, that the oysters had been preyed on by small shellfish, of which there are plenty on the banks. During the fishery of 1874 the late Mr. Nevill accompanied Sir William Gregory on his visit to the banks as Conchologist. He remained behind in Silavatturai. He was there a week, but for some reason never went again to the bank. He gave Captain Donnan some fish-traps, which he asked Captain Donnan to sink on the bank at night, so that he might take them up in the morning and see what was in them. He always found fish in them, and a large number of small shells, which had completely eaten the flesh of some of the fish, leaving the skeletons perfectly clean. Two or three of such shells inserting themselves into an oyster as it lies with its shell open would soon eat away the flesh without in any way injuring the shell. It may be said that the oyster is too sensitive, and would close its shell before its enemy gets in. I have had experience, however, that this is not always the case. At the fishery of 1888 in the kottu two young musk rats were caught by the neck and killed by the oysters closing on them when they had thrust their heads in. In 1891 a sparrow was caught in the same way. This and the oyster I have now preserved in arrack in my collection. I had the rats and oysters also, but they have been removed by some one. One of the shells I have referred to is not larger than the head of the rat or the head and beak of the sparrow, and once in its shell would protect it, whilst it would in a short time disable the oyster and eat it. Skates—(TrygonWarnak); Tamil “ Valuvadi tirukkai.” Skates are a very formidable enemy of the pearl oyster.§ See Mr. Thomas’s Account of the Skates.) There are several species of skates, small and large. The skate seen by Mr. Ihomas at Tuticorin was the Trygon warnak. I have not come across any mention of the skate as doing any damage till the fishery of 18bo (of which hereafter). Some species grow to an enormous size, and when their size, weight, crushing power, and mode of feeding, as described by Mr. Thomas are considered, it can easily be understood what destruction, such as occurred in 1864, would take place on a bank if 50 or 100 of such creatures come on it. Some time after the destruction of the oysters in 1864, which was attributed to the skates by the native divers, it was reported to me that two large skates had been caught by the fishermen of Van- kalai near Mannar.ll I did not receive the information until after they had been cut up and disposed of, and therefore could not make a personal inspection of them. They were described to me as 13 and 14 feet across and 3 feet deep in the deepest part. I mentioned this in one of my reports, and it was thought that I had been deceived by the person who gave me the information, who it was thought might have gradually increased the size of the animals as he decreased his distance to Mannar.^ Mr. Ford, however, of Kalpitiya, who was to ha^e been Magistrate at the fishery of 1864, came to Mannar on his way to Jaffna in a ballam from Kalpitiya some time after and called on me. He said he had been sceptical as to the size of the skates as given by me, but was quite satisfied after what he saw from the ballam, a large skate having leaped out of the water close to the ballam, fully the size I had given of those caught at Vankalai. I did not, however, know then that skates leaped out of the water. I subsequently saw a large one about half the size floating on the sea close to the inspection vessel at the inspection of 1868, when rowing about with Captain Leighton to watch the divers. The alarm was given of “ shark” and the divers stopped work. It disappeared just as we reached the ship. However, the late Mr. Marcus Crawford, Assistant Agent of Mannar, set tli° matter of size at rest. He gave me a sketch and measurement of a large skate caught near the south bar of Mannar (see annexed sketch). This creature measured across 14 feet. * See Appendix 5, A and R. t See Appendix B 1 and B 2. J See Appendix 5, A. § Appendix 1,0 3.

It is not to be wondered at that divers find it impossible to get at the oysters on a bank, and are afraid, in fact, to go down if there are many of these animals on the bank as reported in 1863.* Floods. To the above generally admitted enemies of the pearl oyster I add—Floods of fresh muddy water discharged by rivers, &amp;c., during abnormally heavy rains such as were experienced in 1862-63, 1887-88, and again, as I have been told, in 1898-99, although the native idea, is that a certain quantity of fresh water is required by the pearl oyster and necessary for the production of pearl.f Captain Steuart writes in his “ Account of the Pearl Fisheries,” p. 6 , as follows Some of the fishermen and other natives of the sea coast in the neighbourhood of the pearl bank have supposed that pearl ovsters were generated by the influx of abundant fresh water into the sea from rain and the overflowing of rivers • others believe that the young oysters fall from the clouds with the rain ; while all appear to consider rain water indispensable in the production of oyster spawn. It is possible that oyster spat, like the spawn of fishes, may have been drawn up and suspended in atmospheric vapour until brought down with rain, and this may have given rise to these prevailing delusions in the simple minds of the inhabitants. On the report of Mr. Jonville on the Pearl Fishery, the Hon. Robert Boyd remarks (see page 52 of Captain Steuart’s “ Account of the Pearl Fishery ”) He also states that it is an opinion among the fishermen—and what he assents to—that an influx of a certain quantity of fresh water into the sea is necessary for the production of pearl. Remarks on the above statement: With respect to the observations of the necessity of the supply of a certain quantity of fresh water for the production of pearls in the oysters, there is nothing in such a supposition contrary to reason or analogy. For it is well known that there are certain animals that absolutely require brackish water for their existence such, for instance, as live in the mouths of rivers or within the influence of an influx of fresh water into the salt Mr. Jonville thinks that the pearl itself is the product of a disease in the oysters and causes ultimately the death of the animals. There is no direct proof that it is the case, while it is evident that the animal has the power of elaborating a substance which lines the whole internal surface of its shell of the same nature and appearance as the pearl and consequently that the production of the pearl itself is one of its natural and healthy functions. The cause fixed by Nature of the death of oysters is not known, neither is the duration of their life known. dB. * See Appendix 4, C. j See Appendix 7, D.ix- _ nn this I have no recollection of having been told by I will not pretend to P • ^ as remarked by Captain Stenartand Mr. Jonville. native headmen or divers that free i w ‘ d 1 . ^ g required by the pearl oysters, and that the failure oftli^ us^ial^ rMns^n^he rai^^eason, has a bad effect on the pearl oysters, and Mr. Thomas writes^ of the divers and fisherfolk of Tuticorin as follows „ ir i j j rewards fisherfolk knowledge, it is marvellously good and should never Fisherfolk Knowledge and Myths. - , f q. ; g accretion of ages, not altering with the times for be neglected, but at the same time alway ’ had encrus t e d into a myth even in the days of Pliny, that the instance, they hold firmly to this day t j ’ face at ^awn and taking in a drop of dew with the sun’s rays in it, EVa/cTrect a y S “iroSfattee^ll glisten the loveliest amber that ever the sorrowing sea-bird hath wept.” There may he some truth in some ol the ideas held by the native fishermen and divers as to a there D ® ^ome required by the pearl oysters.

I may be Jong, but I shall hold the opinion till I am shown that I am wrong (as j undera tand him to say) believe in my flood theory, as he does not beheve the flood water can reach the banks, which are,he thinks, too far off the land. I believe that it can and does. Captain for S mLslJ totg fiools by no means so heavy and so prolonged as those of 1862-63,1887-88, and P ve any decided opinion regarding “ pollution by floods ” (see page 26) on the Tuticorin banks, which are however much further from the land than the principal Ceylon banks. He writes as follows :— . Pollution by River Floods —Whether our rivers, the Vembar, Yaipar, and the Tambrapurm, affect the banks , ,, • Lfpr T have no exact knowledge.

ThS amount realized since the so-called revival in 1855 would have sufficed to have covered the cost of the great irrigation works carried out since that time, or to have met the cost of construction of a broad gauge railway from Kurunegala to Elephant Pass. ,, -p The total nett amount realized on account of the pearl fisheries during the Lntish occupation from 1799 to 1899 has amounted to Rs. 10 , 000,000 (£ 1 , 000 , 000 ) ; the total number of oysters fished to over 500,000,000. Experiences. When Mr. Vane made his inspection of the banks in March, 1862, he found oysters 01 i whole of the Cheval and Modragam Paars, and estimated that they would yield good fisheries in 1863, 1861, 1865, and 1866.* , _ , , , It Weis supposed by some tbcit the oysters on the south-enst Chevul b 8 *nk A\eie reucly 101 fishing in 1862, and ought to have been fished then. Mr. Vane, after some hesitation (as I am given to understand), decided to leave them till 1863. . I made the inspection of November with Mr. Worsley, the Supervisor, Mr. Vane having given up the appointment of Superintendent in July, 1862.t Cheval Paar Fishery, 1863.—Oysters dying out. The oysters were in fine condition in November, and the sample was a good one. Heavy rain set in just as we completed the inspection, and there was continuous rain from that time till February, with abnormally heavy floods. We experienced very bad weather with rain when lifting the sample in February for the fishery of March, 1863. The condition of the bank however, when the fishery commenced in March, 1863, wap such as to give cause for much anxiety. The oysters were dying off by thousands, the divers bringing up netfuls of dead shells. Added to this, skates had appeared on the bank according to the reports of the divers, which interfered seriously with their work. The Adigar, the divers, and others attributed at the time the mortality amongst the oysters to the floods.^ Captain Donnan was appointed Inspector of the Pearl Banks in 1863 in place of the Supervisor, Mr. Worsley. § Cheval Paar, 1864.—Total Destruction of Oysters and Loss of Fishery. An inspection was made in November, 1863, of the portion of the bank it was intended to fish in 1861. Though the oysters were dying out it was supposed there would be sufficient to yield a fine fishery in 1864. The sample lifted was a remarkably fine one, valued at Rs. 48.11a. = £4- 17s. 5d the thousand. When we went to lift the sample in February for the fishery of 1864 we found scarcely an oyster on the bank. There had been a general destruction of the oysters, the shells of which, crushed to pieces, bored through and clipped round the edges, were brought up in netfuls by the divers. The destruction, it was said, was caused by skates.|| My opinion is that as the oysters had nearly come to maturity they were injured by the floods of 1862-63, that they began to die off soon after the inspection of November, and then skates and other animals attracted to the banks destroyed what were left. * See Appendix 4, A 1. j See Appendix 4, A 2. % See Appendices 4, 0 ; 4, D ; and 4, E. § See Appendix 4, Gr. See Appendix 5, A and B.Modragam Bank, 1863.—Destruction of Oysters. I believe the heavy floods of 1862-63 had an injurious effect over the whole of the banks. It was estimated that the Modragam would yield a fine fishery in 1865. When we went, however, in November, 1863, from the ground which was to have been fished in 1864 to the Modragam, we found ff bare of oysters. The oysters had entirely disappeared. The Modragam is closer in shore than the Tdieval. 1 believe that the bank was destroyed by the flood just about the time that the Cheval Paar °u St nl 8 We 1 r ® &lt;lying ° ff ° n the 2 round fished in 1863 &gt; and that when dying off the skates driven from the Oheyal Paar went on to the Modragam. I saw when coming in from the inspection vessel one day during the fishery of 1863 a shoal of these creatures pass close by the boat, swimming in the direction, as I believe, of the Modragam. A diver remarked that they were going down to prey on the oysters.* ** Oysters carried off (Jheval Bank, 1888. The most extraordinary experience, however, was that of 1888, when most of the oysters were •carried off the Cheval bank, when the fishery was nearly abandoned in consequence, and when most ■of the fishing was carried on, not on the banks, but on the ground round them over an extent of 6 miles in length by 4 miles in breadth.f I gave my opinion in regard to this in my report of the fishery (see extract from my report),J I still hold the opinion I then expressed, that flood and current were the cause of the disturbance. Ihere was a heavy flood in December and January, 1887-88, and there was no doubt a very strong current. 1 believe current and flood acted together. Two large bodies of water of different temperatures and densities moving swiftly and with force meeting in the neighbourhood of the banks would, in my opinion, have caused a commotion which would have been sufficient to carry away the oysters in the way they were. Disappearance of Oysters.—Muttuvarattu and Cheval Banks, 1899. We have again floods and currents, and again a'disappearance of oysters as reported by Captain Donnan. As supposed by Captain Donnan, skates very probably have come on the banks as they apparently did on the Cheval in 1863 and again in 3864, and I believe on the Modragam in 1863, to prey on the oysters sickened and dying off from the effects of the flood and being carried away by the current.§ In regard to all these enemies of the pearl oyster, there is yet much to be learnt. A great deal of very important information might be obtained by a sober, steady, intelligent, and observant man (not necessarily a Naturalist) stationed on the banks during the months from October to June in a decent vessel with the necessary appliances. It is not possible to get much information during inspections which are carried on in fine weather and for limited periods, except as regards the state of the banks as to whether oysters are on them or not. Age of Oysters, and Conditions and Circumstances under which Fisheries should he decided on. The limit of age of the pearl oyster, the age at which it begins to form pearl, and when it is in its prime for fishing, are points on which there has been much controversy. The Naturalist told us we knew little or nothing of these matters ; that we were all working in the dark ; that the native ideas were all nonsense and not to be relied on, &amp;c. Now, the Naturalist himself knew as little. He has not shown us in what particular points the native ideas are much out of the way and unreliable. The Naturalist employed by the Ceylon Government between 1865 and 1869 accepted the false spat as the true spat of the oyster and worked on it.|| I fully admit that he was much handicapped in carrying on his researches into the natural history of the pearl oyster, and they were in consequence somewhat limited. He came out just after the destruction of oysters on the Cheval Paar in 1864, and returned to England before fresh broods had come on the banks. Pie did not see a fishei’y, and did not witness an inspection of a bank with a bed of oysters on it, young or old. Dr. Kelaart, who was sent to the fisheries of 1857, 1858, and 1859 to study the natural history of the pearl ovster, was most enthusiastic in his work. He constantly visited the backs during the fisheries of 1857,1858, and 1859, and at the last worked with a Swiss Naturalist, whose name I forget. His observations were however mostly carried on in connection with the pearl oyster in an aquarium in which, as Mr. Thomas remarks, the oyster is a different thing to one on a pearl bank. His researches were unfortunately cut short before they had assumed any practical form and shape.11 He has, however, left some very valuable papers on the pearl oyster for a future Naturalist to work on, and which would be useful for future Superintendents, Inspectors, and the Supervisor, if one be appointed. No Naturalist has yet, so far as I am aware, reared pearl oysters in an aquarium, tank, reservoir, or enclosed portion of the sea from minute spat to maturity, ascertaining their exact condition at various stages of growth. ... . After the experience I have had on the pearl banks, my opinion is that the native ideas are not very far wrong or out of the way, being the result of centuries of experience and observation, foiced on and backed up by the desire for gain. . It seems to me absurd to suppose that intelligent men, keen men of business, merchan s, headmen, divers, and others should for centuries have come to pearl fisheries for pui poses of and yet not have made it a part of their business to ascertain something regarding the nature of the pearl oyster to guide them in their speculations and pursuits. _ j £ Captain Steuart records in page 37 of his “Account ” some information gathered bj older o Government from leading merchants and headmen regarding the age of oysters, &amp;c. § See Appendices 4, 0 and 4, K. || See Appendix 6, A. * See Appendices 4, A ; 4, J ; and 4, K. f See Appendices 7, A 4 ; 7, C ; and 7, I). f Dn K P edaart X pro2eded to England soon after the fishery of 1859, when he worked Silavatturai.

Mr Vane hi his diary of inspection of March, 1861, expresses his opinion that the Modragam oysters fishedTn 1860 ought to have been kept another year, and thinks Captain Pritchard did wrong in fishino - them i I believe, on the contrary, that Captain Pritchard did right m fishing them.

This would very probably have been lost if the oysters had been kept for another year. Varieties of Oysters in Kotu Fishery, 1888. It must be borne in mind that pearl oysters vary very considerably in shape, colour, and size, and that certain banks and sections of banks have oysters peculiar to them.§ Certain banks, too as for instance the Cheval, the Modragam, the Peria Paar, and the Muttuvarattu Paars (as recently proved) have conditions in depth of water, and the nature of ground and its surroundings, which are more favourable to the pearl oyster and to the formation of pearls than other banks with less water on them and closer to the shore. Cheval and Modragam Oysters considered finest. The oysters of the Cheval and Modragam banks have always been considered the finest and richest in pearl, the oysters of the Modragam being even more esteemed than those of the Cheval. The small thick oysters of the Peria Paar are also much esteemed as being rich in pearls of hne 1 On the contrary, the flat oysters found on the Nadukkuda Paar and washed up on the south coast of Mannar, and those of the Mandativu bank near Jaffna in shallow water, are almost worthless. The extraordinary fishery of 1888, when the oysters of the Cheval and Modragam banks seemed to be all mixed up, afforded an exceptional opportunity for seeing the variety of oysters on the banks. On March 22, 1888, I visited the kottn and recorded what I had seen.|| Important Matters to be considered before deciding on a Fishery. There are, however, other important matters to be considered besides the age of the oyster before a fishery can be decided on :— (1) Are the oysters plentiful on one bank, or on more than one bank, and more than can possibly he fished in one year, as in 1857 and again in 1880 ? or (2) Are the oysters thick on a comparatively small compact patch, heal thy-looking, ana likely to improve in condition if allowed to remain another year, without risk . or (3) Are they scattered over a large area in small patches and likely to be carried away by current or otherwise destroyed ? or (4) Are the oysters plentiful on a bank, but comparatively young and immature, but likely to yield a return, even though small, if fished at once, with every probability ot their being carried away by current if left for another year, as in the case of the Muttuvarattu Paar in 1889 ; or dying off, as was the case with regard to oysters on the Cheval and Modragam in 1887.11 In all such cases much must be left to the discretion and judgment of the Superintendent and Inspector. Take, for instance, the fisheries of 1857, 1858, and 1859. The Cheval and part of Modragam banks were covered thick with the same brood. It would have been impossible to have fished all the oysters in one year, and if left till they all reached maturity there was the risk of then dying out. Mr. Vane very wisely decided to fish a part of the Cheval in 1857, although the oysters were young. There was a general howl (backed up unfortunately by the Naturalist, who aired his opinions all over Silavatturai) against Mr. Vane and Captain Higgs, to the effect that the bank was too young to be fished. * See Appendix 2, A. t See Appendix 6, F. % See Appendix 4, A. § See Appendices 7, C and 8, I. || See Appendix 7, 0. *|f See Appendices 7, A 1, A 2, and A o.Mr. Vane experienced much difficulty in conducting the fishery that year inconsequence. In 1858 the oysters were in their prime, and there was every prospect of a sum of Rs. 1,000.000 being realized, when the fishery was suddenly cut short by an outbreak of cholera. In 1859 the oysters were dying out. Again, in the inspection of March, 1862, it was found that the Cheval and Modragam ^nks were stocked with the same brood. Mr. Vane hesitated to hold a fishery in 1862, and this is not to be wondered at considering the howl that was raised against him in 1857.* * * § He estimated that there would be large fisheries in 1863, 1864, and 1865. When the oysters of the Cheval came to be fished in 1863, it was found they were dying out—killed, as I believe, by the flood. With my present experience, I think I would have recommended a fishery in 1862. A fishery in 1862 would probably have saved the fishery lost in 1 864, as the oysters destroyed would have been fished in 1863.f It would not, however, have saved the fishery expected from the Modragam in 1865, as the Modragam oysters were all destroyed, as before remarked, about the time of the fishery of 1863 or immediately after.! Again, in 1880 and 1881 § the Cheval bank was stocked thick with one brood of oysters. It was a question whether there should be a fishery in 1880 or not, the oysters being young and the sample valued very low.f Captain Donnan wrote to me on the subject. I thought with him that the oysters were too young. He agreed with me that they were young, but he suggested that there should be a fishery, as it would be impossible to fish all the oysters if left till 1881, if they remained on the bank. I agreed with him, and we recommended a fishery for 1880 ; and it was just as well we did so, as it took the largest body of divers who had come to any recent fishery, working very hard for six weeks, to finally clear the bank in 1881, when the oysters were in their prime.^[ In 1887 it was found, after the inspection of March, that the young oysters on the south-west Cheval and northern Modragam were dying off, and a fishery had to be suddenly carried out in order to gather in these oysters, at about the time when a fishery generally comes towards its close.''* Again, in 1889 Captain Donnan recommended that the Muttuvarattu Paar should be fished in March, 1889, although the oysters were young and the sample valued at only Rs. 1026, as he feared the young oysters would be carried away, the bank being liable to currents. I must confess as I shall hereafter show, that this bank (never fished before) somewhat upset all calculations and yielded three fisheries in succession, the last, that of 1891, having been the finest during the British occupation.!! . The Naturalist in 1858 cried out that the banks were being destroyed by the mode in which fishing was carried out by the native divers ; that immature and young oysters were being fished with the older oysters, and called on the Superintendent and Inspector to issue an order to the divers to throw back into the sea all young and immature oysters immediately they were fished up ; and, as far as I can gather from the records, some pretence seems to have been made of this haying been done. To any one acquainted with a fishery and the work on the banks, it must be obvious how impossible it would be to get such an order carried into effect. . Supposing, however, that all immature and young oysters were thrown back, how many is it estimated would survive? I venture to say not even 5 per cent. Torn up from the rocks or from the oysters they were adhering to, and the byssus injured or altogether destroyed, most of would be carried away and lost. Any person taking a walk of an evening from Arippu to Konda - chy during a pearl fishery, or from Arippu to Marichchukkadi in the south-west monsoon, wi see enough in dead oyster shells (thrown over by divers), chank-spawn, shells, corralline, weeds, &amp;c., thrown up on the beach, to convince him that there is a pretty strong wash over the banks when the south-west wind sets in. , , ■, It stands to reason that after a brood of oysters has finally settled on a bank, that other brooas must at intervals come on and settle on the old ones ; and, if the oyster breeds as the Naturalist tells us it does, the old oysters must be yielding spawn before they are ready to be fished, and it must oe obvious therefore that in the course and law of nature there must be a mixture of oysters ot all ages on a bank when it comes to be fished. , ,, .

The question is, Are the oysters o 'K f them ? Experienced officers like Captains Phipps and hat^ho^hHt^w7tt7ef^e U to ^ rTcordthis estimate of two experienced officers as a guide to any that we may hereafter have less experienced. I fully concur with Captains Phipps and Donnan in the opinion expressed by them. Age of Oysters. For all practical purposes I believe enough is known regarding the age of the pearl oysters, and when they should be fished. Much must, as I have submitted, depend on the ground on which the brood may settle and the condition in which they are found. . , , , When oysters about the size of a sixpence, shilling, or crown piece are found on a bank, it may be safely assumed, I think, that they are six, twelve, and eighteen months old. M hen found they should be carefully watched till they have been on the banks three years, and samples should be then taken and examined. All this requires regular inspections and careful watching. Of course it would be more satisfactory to work up from the minute spat, if it can be found m any quantity on a bank. I do not, however, suppose that much harm has been done or loss sustained bv false spat having been mistaken for the real minute spat of the oyster, except that it has given rise to much misconception as to the alleged appearance and sudden and unaccountable disappearance of broods of young oysters from the banks, when, after all, it was only the false spat that had come and gone. Migration of Oysters. I do not myself believe in the theory of the migration in a body of broods of oysters from one bank to another after they have once firmly settled on a bank. I have not seen any satisfactory evidence in support of this. Mr. Vane, in his diary of April, 1862,|| tries to account for the unexpected find of oysters about three or four year old on the Modragam in 1862 on the ground fished in 1860, by supposing that they had migrated or been carried by the currents from the Karativn banks across the Karativu shoal, and he says :— The inexplicable circumstances connected with the migration of oysters under which known beds have disappeared and others have been found are exemplified by the present condition of the Modragam. I do not know on what evidence Mr. Vane made this statement regarding migration. My opinion is that this bed of oysters had been missed at a previous inspection. There was apparently a muddle about bearings at that time.IF I cannot believe that a large bed of oysters could be drifted across a shoal and be deposited in a compact body on another bank some seven miles off. They must, I should think, be scattered if carried off by current from a bank. I doubt if many would survive, as by being torn off the rock to which they were adhering the byssus must be injured or destroyed.** Banks said to be overfished—not the case. I do not concur in the least with those who cry out that the banks are or have been overfished, and consequently that no oysters have been left to breed and replenish the banks. The divers do not and cannot clear away all the oysters on a bank at a fishery. There are many left scattered over a bank, and if oysters breed as the Naturalist says they do there are enough left to replenish a bank. I believe, however, in the native ideas, that the banks are replenished by spawn coming in on them from the gulf. I have seen young oysters in bunches for miles floating in the neighbourhood of the Periya Paar, and I have no doubt that the fact of young oysters having been seen floating in this way has given rise to the native idea that the Periya Paar is the “ mother bank ’ from which the other banks are replenished.ft I believe that if every oyster were carried off from the Cheval and Modragam banks, they would again be replenished in due course by spawn from the deep sea. No fishing carried on by the divers could have done more injury to the hanks than the destruction on the Cheval by skates (as supposed) in 1864 ; the total destruction of the oysters on the Modragam in 1863 by, I believe, flood and skates ; and the clean sweep of the Cheval in 1888 by current and (I believe) flood. Two or three years ago, however, young oysters were found on the Cheval, and 72,000,000 were estimated to have been on the Mnttuvarattu Paar, the last bank fished (in 1891). Annual Fisheries or Fisheries at Regular Intervals—not likely. I do not think it will he ever found possible to bring about annual fisheries or fisheries at regular intervals. Sir Edward Barnes tried this. Captain Steuart, who worked under him, thought apparently he had succeeded, when suddenly there came on the interval of “ no fishery ” from 1837 to 1855. * See Appendix 8, D. f See Appendices 8, H ; 8,1; and 8, J. X Exclusive of divers’ share, which amounts to Rs. 860,000. § See Appendix 8, I 2. ** See Appendix 4, A. || See Appendix 4, A1. ff See Appendix 4, H and I. See Appendix 4, F 1 and F 2.a g a in thought he had brought about regular fisheries in connection with the fisheries trom 1857 to 1860 and the inspection of 1862, when he thought there would be a series of fisheries to 1865. Then came the dying out of oysters on the Cheval in 1863, the crash of 1861, the total destruc tion of the Modragam oysters in 1863. # V Then, in 1887, comparatively immature oysters were found dying out on the Cheval and Modragam Paars, when a fishery was suddenly held in April. Then came the current and flood of 1888, which swept away the oysters from the banks, and nearly brought about the collapse of the advertised fishery; and finally, there is the recent dis appearance of oysters from the Cheval and Muttuvarattu Paars, rendering it probable that there will not be another fishery before 1905, making an interval of fourteen years at least from that of 1891. Whcit has taken place during this century will in all probability occur in the next century. There will no doubt be large and profitable fisheries, small fisheries, and short or long intervals of “ no fisheries.” It is for Government to cause the banks to be carefully inspected, and beds of oysters, when found, to be carefully watched, and, whenever it can, to gather in the harvest of the sea and “ be thankful.” Five hundred million oysters and a net return of £1,000,000 or Rs. 10,000,000 is, after all, not so bad. Added to this, however, are the indirect advantages of a fishery. A fishery brings in money and gives employment to a large number of the inhabitants of Jaffna, Mannar, and other places in Ceylon, and to a large number of boatmen and divers of Southern India. The fishery of 1887, for instance, was a perfect Godsend to the people of Jaffna and Mannar and the divers of Southern India, and saved Government a large outlay in relief works.f What Government should do, and in what the System hitherto has failed as regards finding and watching. In a report by the late Captain Worsley, who was employed for some time by Mr. Vane as Supervisor of the Banks, and subsequently commanded the ss. Serendib, in reply, to the best of my recollection, to some criticisms of the Naturalist, he summed up in six words what Government had to do in regard to the pearl oysters, viz.:—“Find them—Watch them—Fish them.” Find them! —A perusal of Captain Steuart’s “Account of the Pearl Fisheries” Avill show that this has not always been attended with success. He believed that several beds of oysters had been from time to time missed and fisheries lost. Even in 1836 a bank was lost and two or three beds of young oysters fished by mistake. He attributed this in a great measure to the clumsy boats used for inspections and the ignorance of the native headmen,J he as Inspector having been obliged to work in a sailing vessel, two Government sailing vessels, the “Wellington” and “Anne,” having been employed on the banks. There is no doubt, however, that professional jealousy, divided responsibility, want of proper landmarks, incorrect (or rather confused) compass bearings, incorrect charts, and unsatisfactory in spections had a great deal to do with it, as may be gathered from portions of the “Account.” In fact, there used to be a very great deal of mystery hanging round the pearl banks, the cause of which I could not understand until I had the opportunity of working on them myself and found there was nothing very mysterious, although there is much yet to be learnt about them. Captain Steuart, Master Attendant of Colombo, was appointed Inspector of the Pearl Banks in 1826. The Commissioners of Inquiry in 1832 recommended that a naval officer should be appointed as Supervisor of the Pearl Banks, and that he should have sole charge of the banks, taking up the duties then performed by the Inspector (the Master Attendant of Colombo). As 1 read the recom mendation of the Commissioners as given in Captain Steuart’s “Account of the Fisheries,” page 23, the Commissioners did not seem to quite realize what the pearl banks were and where they were situated. They seemed to have been under the impression that they were close to the shore and easily accessible in small boats and could be watched from the shore, as they recommended that the Supervisor should reside in Arippu and have two or three boats placed at his disposal. However, I presume it was supposed he could cruise about occasionally in the “ Wellington” or “Anne,” two Government vessels which were employed on the banks. The appointment of an officer as recommended hung fire for three years, consequent on some representation made by Captain Steuart (see his “ Account ”). In 1835, on the ‘recommendation of the Admiral of the station, Sir Thomas Bladen Capel, a Mr. Quinton, a master in the Navy, was appointed Supervisor on £500 per annum, and Captain Steuart was directed to hand over to him all papers, charts, &amp;c., connected with the pearl banks and place him in sole charge of the banks. Then commenced the “ professional jealousy ” and “ divided responsibility,” which, as I believe, led to the loss of a bed of oysters in 1836 (see Steuart s “ Account ). From 1836 Captain Steuart seems to have acted in some way as Inspector. In 1840 an important change and improvement took place in regard to a vessel for inspection, a steamer—a small paddle steamer—the “ Seaforth,” built in Bombay especially for the pearl banks, having arrived. Government considered that the Supervisor should command this vessel, and no doubt it was the proper place for him and not the house in Arippu. However, Mr. Quinton, on the * Experiences of 1863, 1864 ; Modragam, 1863 ; Cheval, 1887 and 1888 ; Muttuvarattu, 1899. f See Appendix 7, A 2. ^ T -• ht t Pearl Fishery Headmen .—There were, I believe, five Fisher Headmen: Don J. M. Patchico, Adigar of Mannar; Arasunilayidda Modliyar Santiagopulle, Maniagar of Karaiyur ; two Adappens ; and a Pattankoddi. These headmen were remunerated by what were called privileges. Each diving boat carried ten divers and five stones, aiiii I think the privilege amounted to two boats, the Adigar having one (viz., five stones), the Maniagar two stones of the other boat, and the three minor headmen one a piece. From 1837 to 1855 these men worked without remuneration, receiving their remuneration a lump at the fisheries, and this caused some jealousy. They generally sold their privileges at the beginning of a fishery. All privileges were abolished after 1863. The Adigar of Mannar had the last privilege m 1863. I cannot endorse altogether Captain Steuart’s remark regarding the headmen. I had a good deal of work to do with the Adigar of Mannar, Don J. M Patchico, and tlm Karaiyur Maniagar, Arasunilayidda Modliyar Santiagopulle, during the fisheries of 1857,18c&gt;8, and 1859, and I found them highly intelligent and well-informed men, well acquainted with the pearl banks and matters connected wit the fisheries. They'helped Mr. Vane and Captain Pritchard to carry on the fisheries of 18o5, 18o6, 1857, 1858, 1859, and 1860, and the Adigar of Mannar rendered me very valuable service during the fishery of 1863.( 14 ) ground of ill-health, declined to take lector M H e ?h^e«^ brother of the Mastei Attendan , was , ointm e n t was re-appointed on a reduced salary remained on the banks a short ime g e p 1 p from the banks and gent to car ry the English wet ^io^bo^dBoibir Thelwo Government vesse.e, the •&lt; Wellington ” and “ Anne| were 6old r V 00 ^ of the Commissioners of Inquiry, that an officer In my numDie opinion bM aV .

Diving Bells. In 1825 at the instance of Sir Edward Barnes, two diving bells were brought out from England for use on the pearl banks. I find the following notes regarding them in Captain Steuart s “Account, page 20 :— . It had been believed by many persons that the native divers employed by Government at the examination ot the banks were subiect to the improper influence of certain wealthy natives who were suspected of employing boats and divers to rob the oyster beds, and that therefore the reports given by the divers could not be depended upon It had also been said that the oyster beds were at some periods overwhelmed with drifted sand, which at othei times passed away To clear up these doubtful reports appears to have been one, if not the only use, of the diving bells, for one native diver at a pearl fishery would collect more oysters in a day than could be obtained by all the men that could work in a diving bell. a Mr. Jonville makes the following remark in his report (see Captain Steuart s “Account, page 51) :— It also appears from the same report that the Dutch used diving bells, which were not found to answer the purpose expected. On the above statement the Hon. Mr. Robert Boyd made the following remark (page 02, Steuart s “ Account ”) :— The inapplicability of the diving bells to fishing for oysters arises from the difficulty of working such a machine and from the small surface included within its circumference. The cost of working the diving bellsf is not given, but it must have been considerable. The persons sent down in the bells were soldiers of one of the regiments, as I was informed. ^ Captain Steuart makes special mention of the good services rendered by the “ Seaforth, especiallv in towing into position the unwieldly inspection boats in 1840. She was, however, removed from the banks as remarked in 1841, turned into a mail packet, and sent to carry the mails between Colombo and Bombay. She was no doubt too expensive a vessel for service on the pearl banks. She was again employed for a short time at inspections in 1851, 1852, and 1853, was sold off in lb54, and was sent to Cochin to be converted into a sailing vessel, and was there burnt. The “ Wellington and “ Anne ” having been sold, Captain Steuart had to revert to a hired sailing vessel, and made the inspections for the fishery of 1855 in a brig, the “ Rangoon.” All the inspections and fisheries from that time to 1858 were made in a hired native schooner, the “ Geraldine,” with the native inspection boats and two English boats belonging to the Master Attendant’s Department, Colombo, which were sent up for inspections and fisheries. Inspections previous to 1841 unsatisfactory, but not expensive. The inspections thus made up to 1858, unsatisfactory though they were in some respects, were not at the same time expensive. To 1840, as remarked, two Government sailing _ vessels, the “Wellington” and the “Anne,” were alternately employed in guarding the banks and in inspection The pearl fishery headmen received certain privileges at a fishery up to 1862, and the Adigar up to 1863, and were bound to supply boats at a fixed rate for inspections and for guard ^boats at fisheries. The upkeep of the “Wellington” amounted to £850 (see Steuart’s “Account’). Ihe “Wellington” and “Anne” rendered good service in other ways in conveying troops, stores, «c., and a number of Ceylon lads were trained in them as seamen, and some of them were afterwards employed in the Master Attendant’s Department, Colombo and Galle, in the “ Seaforth,” and on the * * Mr. G-eo. Steuart was subsequently head of the firm of Geo. Steuart &amp; Co., the firm having been founded by Cap a James Steuart, who retired in 1855, leaving the firm of Geo. Steuart &amp; Co. to Geo. Steuart, who himself retired from the r somewhere about 1860, taking out a large sum of money (it is said £80,000). Managing the firm of Geo. Steuart &amp; Do. evidently more profitable than commanding the “ Seaforth ” on £300 a year. _ , r f I find by a memorandum in page 74 of Steuart’s “ Account,” that the estimated cost of the diving bell establishmen p annum came to £47. The cost of the bells seems to have been £1,700.pearl banks as pilots, boatswains, coxswains, &amp;c., and others as masters of native vessels not merely coasters. The hire of the native vessels for inspections and fisheries amounted to £60 £70 and £80 sterling a month. In 1858 the “ Seaforth ” was replaced by that iron monster, the “ Pearl,” and from the inspection of November, 1858, to 1866, the inspections were carried on in her except in February, 1863, jffid during the fishery of 1863, when she had gone to Calcutta for repairs. I was left to make the best arrangement I could to carry on the inspection of February, 1863, and the fishery of 1863 with Captain Worsley in a native vessel, and with some difficulty hired a schooner, the “Sky Rocket.” The “ Pearl ” was the guard ship at the fishery of 1860. Steamer “ Pearl ” unsuited for Inspection Work. The “ Pearl ” was quite unsuited for work on the pearl banks. She was a clumsy iron ship and, as she consumed about 5 tons of coal a day when working on the bank with fires banked at night, she was a very expensive vessel to work‘in. She was not, like the “Seaforth” purchased specially for work on the banks, but to ply round the Island with goods and passengers. Much inconvenience was therefore caused to the public and loss to Government when she was employed on the pearl banks. r J The cost of coal was very high. I have some recollection of having been obliged to pass a voucher for £1,000 for coal for one inspection. It was with a sigh I passed the vouchers for this vessel, feeling as I did that money was being uselessly thrown away when it might have been profitably spent on a suitable vessel which could have been always employed on the banks. “ General Havelock .-” unsatisfactory A rrangement. In 1867, the “ Pearl ” having been sold, the inspection was made in March, 1867, in the hired steamer “ General Havelock a most unsatisfactory arrangement. I do not remember what Govern ment paid for the vessel; it must have been about £50 a day. The Commander was in perpetual fear we were going to ruin his vessel on a reel or on shore. If our boats were not in by 5, or anything urgent had to be done, there was a growl all round that officers and crew were kept working over hours. Altogether it was an experience I should not have cared to go through a second time. From 1867 up to 1887 the inspections and the fisheries were carried out in hired vessels, except in 1868, when I made the inspection of March, 1868, with Captain Leighton in the immigrant ship the “ Royal Eagle ” and in November by myself in the immigrant ship “ Lawrence Nairne.” It was risky work, however, employing immigrant vessels, as they were not bound by their charters to work anywhere beyond the immigrant route, and if one of them had been lost or injured I should have had to bear the cost.* In 1869 Captain Donnan complained bitterly of the difficulty he experienced in getting a small native vessel for the inspection of November, and thus losing a great deal of valuable time.f Steam Launch. In 1874 a steam launch was brought out from England for work on the pearl banks. Since 1881 an immigrant vessel has been employed at fisheries and inspections, as by the conditions on which they are now chartered the immigrant vessels can be employed on any service within defined limits. European Divers. Mr. Vane in 1862 recommended the discharge of all the native headmen who had to that time been employed on the banks, except the Adigar of Mannar ; the abolition of the privileges except that of the Adigar ; the discontinuance of the clumsy native boats except the one for the use of the Adigar ; and the purchase of European boats and the employment of native tindals as coxswains to be in charge of them at fisheries and inspections, the coxswains to be paid a retaining fee and special allowances during fisheries and inspections ; the employment of a fixed number (twelve) of divers on a retaining fee and pay during fisheries and inspections. Boatmen for the boats to be engaged in Colombo as required. He also recommended the engagement of a Supervisor on £200 per annum. He also recommended new buoys being provided in place of what he termed the clumsy buoys then in use. The recommendations made were all sanctioned. In 1858 Mr. Vane obtained authority to get a European diver from England with his assistant. They came to the fishery of 1859 and were employed on the banks. They were expensive luxuries, but their cost I do not know, and what they did I do not know. They had both returned to England before 1862, having been employed for some time in Galle harbour on the wreck of the “ Malabar.” Mr, Vane then employed for the inspection of 1861 a very able diver, Mr. Kerr, of the Peninsular and Oriental Company’s service. He gave some instructions to two discharged seamen picked up by Mr. Vane in Colombo, and they were taken on as divers : one was dismissed for drunkenness and insubordination in 1863, the other remained on till 1868 and died in hospital in Colombo.J Authority was also given to Mr. Vane to order from England a small schooner for service on the pearl banks. Mi*. Vane gave orders for the purchase of boats, vessels, and construction of buoys, and appointed coxswains, European divers, &amp;c., before he retired from the office of Superintendent in July, 1862. Mr. Vane was not fortunate in some of the men he engaged, and I experienced much trouble working with them during the fishery of 1863. Instead of neat, serviceable iron buoys the Department entrusted with the duty of furnishing the buoys sent up, for the inspection of November, 1862, a number of large, heavy, clumsy, iron, coal tar drums, with cables much too short for them and small anchors which could not hold them. Many of them sank after being laid out, owing to the bungholes not having been properly soldered. Captain Donnan reverted to the old triangular wooden buoys, and in addition made use of bamboos secured to round stones, which answered very well indeed, and cost little. § * See Appendix 6 C and 6 G-. f See Appendix 3, F and F 1. t See Appendix 3, A. § See Appendix 3, B 2.-r-i* 1 C 56 ) Schooner “ Geylon.' The schooner ordered from England, named the “ Ceylon,” came out in time for the inspection of November, 1862, and the fishery of 1868. She turned out a failure. She was too small and a very uncomfortable vessel to be in. She might have done for a_pleasure boat on a lake, but certainly was not suited for work on the banks. She was sold off in 1867. . The “ Barge.' One large European boat called the “ Barge ” had for many years been employed on the pearl banks and during the north-east monsoon as a guard boat. She was however a guard boat merelv in name The original barge was the long boat of the “ Intrepid (transport) lost m Colombo m 1834 during a gale. She was a fairly good boat, and was employed in the banks till i860. Her successor was a man-of-war pinnace sent out from England, a very fine boat and very useful for all work required of a boat, such as landing and shipping troops, laying out and raising buoys, looking after the divine - boats, &amp;c., but she was not suited for the duty of guarding the banks, and I suspect that the greater part of her time was spent in Pukulam near Marichchukaddi. She was, besides, undermanned, having had a crew of only four men and a boy besides the coxswain. Naturalist. In 1865 the Naturalist, Mr. Holdsworth, was engaged and he remained till 1869 (five years). It was found necessary to provide him with a vessel to work in, and a three-masted schooner, the “Phantom ” which happened to be in Colombo for sale, was, on the advice oi Mr. vane, purchased for him at’a cost, I believe, of £1,500 sterling. Mr. Holdsworth was not accustomed to a sailing vessel and did not understand a vessel heeling over to the wind when under canvas. He felt nervous and said the vessel was crank. She was accordingly condemned by him and sold. A brig, the “Alligator,” was then hired for him, which resulted in a row with the master and a lawsuit; and finally the'sehooner “ Geraldine ” was engaged. I believe from £60, 70, to 80 a month were paid for these vessels.* Boats. The four boats purchased to replace the native boats were all too small ; three of them were good boats of their class. They were sold off, and Captain Donnan obtained authority to build four larger boats in Colombo. These boats are still in the service. Purchase and Hire of Vessels a failure. Altogether the purchase and hire of boats and vessels up to 1870 was somewhat of a failure. Steam Launch a Success. In 1872 Captain Donnan obtained authority to order from England an auxiliary screw steam launch. She came out in time for the inspection of 1873 and fishery of 1874. She was a great success. I believe she was built by Messrs. White of Cowes. She could both steam and sail well, the screw being disconnected when she was under canvas. She was a good sea boat decked with a well aft. She was in every way well fitted up ; the only fault, perhaps, was that she was a little too small. She came across in July, 1879, from Tuticorin under canvas, the south-west blowing a gale. She was most handy for going out to and returning from the banks, and 1 missed her much during the fisheries of 1890 and 1891. She could tow six diving boats against a strong head wind and sea, and twelve in fine calm weather, and she could tow the inspection vessel from one part of the bank to another, and she was most useful in towing the inspection boats into position. Why Captain Donnan got rid of her I do not know, but I believe she was given over to the Harbour Works and the tug “Active ” (somewhat dilapidated at the time) taken in her place. The “Active ” is a good tug and was very useful in towing, but was not suited for general work on the banks, having no decent accommodation. She has been, moreover, a somewhat expensive vessel. She can do nothing under canvas. I have entered at some length into the matter of vessels purchased for the pearl banks and the expenditure incurred on account of vessels for inspections. I think I have said enough to show that whilst there has been heavy expenditure incurred since 1855—in the purchase of vessels, which turned out unsuited for the work they were required for, in the employment of heavy steamers like the “Pearl” and the “General Havelock” and in hiring vessels for inspections and fisheries—the Fishery Department is yet unprovided with a suitable vessel for inspections and other services on the banks. The amount expended in purchase of vessels, in hiring vessels, and in cost of coal would have been more than sufficient to have met the cost of a vessel specially fitted for service on the banks. At this moment the Superintendent and Inspector have no vessel for inspections or fisheries, and one must be hired or an immigration vessel must be borrowed for the purpose, and in the intervals of the inspections it is impossible for the Superintendent and Inspector to make visits to the banks and personally to observe what goes on on them. Watching of Banks inefficiently carried out after 1841. Down to 1810 Government seemed to have provided in the matter of vessels as efficieptly as it could with the means available before that time for inspection and watching, two Government vessels, the “Wellington” and “Anne,” having been employed on the banks and kept constantly cruising over them. Since 18-10 (about which time these vessels were sold) the Superintendent and Inspector have had no vessel in which to make an occasional cruise on the banks and in their neighbourhood. W hen Assistant Agent of Mannar and Superintendent of the Fishery, I often wished I could occasionally go out to the banks during the north-east monsoon. Much valuable information might have been obtained (as for instance in 1862 and again in 1887-88, in regard to the floods and currents which it is believed did so much damage) if a vessel had been at the disposal ot the Superintendent and had been kept cruising on the banks. Much informa tion also might have been obtained in regard to the other enemies of the pearl oysters. £80 a month was paid for the “ Alligator.” —I believe that a large proportion, if not the whole, of the expenses of a vessel might have been met by the proceeds of a chank fishery such as I suggested being established in the neighbourhood of the banks in 1888. # Fish them.—Native Divers. Fish them ! I doubt if any service has been so economically and so efficiently performed as that of the fishing for pearl oysters on behalf of Government at the Ceylon fisheries. I fail to see how this service can be improved on under existing circumstances and conditions. The attempt made to improve on it in 1825 by the introduction of diving bells, and in 1859 and in 1885 by the employment of European divers, were complete failures. An Arab diver came to the fishery 0^1887 with air pump, helmet, and dress. He hired a boat and pumpers and worked thus equipped on the bank one day. The next day he gave up the dress and worked as an ordinary diver, as he found he could do much more without the dress. A large body of men, from 4,000 to 5,000 in number—boat owners, boatmen, divers and their attendants (of whom at least 1,000 to 1,500 are divers)—come to a fishery from ports of Southern India to fish pearl oysters for the Government, bringing with them their own boats fully equipped, erect their own huts, and supply themselves with all necessaries, not one cent being expended by Govern ment on their account. They are paid for their labour in kind. They receive now one-third of the oysters fished. If a boat brings in 9,000 oysters, the boat owner, crew, and divers get as their share 3,000. If a fishery does not turn out as well as expected, they have to bear all loss on account of expenditure on boats. Government loses nothing on account of them. Where else could such a body of men be got together to work so hard, to endure so much, and give so little trouble, on similar terms ? Their powers of endurance are simply marvellous. For instance, a fishery is fixed to commence on say 1st March. At midnight on the 28th February the boats have to go out twelve miles to a bank. At 7 in the morning of 1st March diving commences, and is carried on till 1 p.m. The boats then commence to run in with the sea breeze. If the wind is favourable, they get in with little difficulty at 4 P.M. If, however, the wind falls and the land wind sets in, as it very often does with heavy rain, they have to pull their boats in, reaching the kottu late in the evening. On reaching the kottu they have to carry their loads of oysters to the kottus and receive there their shares, carry them out, dispose of them, get a hasty meal, snatch a little sleep, and go out again at midnight for the next day’s fishing. This goes on (as in 1881) for six weeks with only the Sunday’s rest. It requires a power of endurance, as I know well from what I have seen, to do all this.f It is all very well for the Naturalist to exclaim against the system on which the banks are fished, as he did in 1858 and 1859, to cry out that the banks are being destroyed by the divers fishing up young oysters which they ought to have left behind, and that numbers of oysters are being destroyed by the anchors of the boats and the stones of the divers being dropped on them, &amp;c. All this is very fine ; but will the Naturalist suggest any other practicable way of fishing them without the risks and evils ? European Divers cannot work against a Current. Fishing for pearl oysters cannot be profitably carried on by European divers equipped as they are at the present day. This was fully proved on the Tuticorin banks in 1861, and again (I think in 1885) when Captain Donnan brought up some European divers to fish the Chilaw banks, and was, I think, obliged to send them all back to Colombo, as they could simply do nothing in the way of picking up oysters.! I admit, however, that if a Naturalist is engaged by Government to carry on scientific researches on the banks, the services of a European diver will be necessary to assist him in carrying out his experiments and researches over a limited area in deep water, in the same way that a diver works at the Breakwater or a reef in Galle harbour. Supposing, however, that European divers could be employed in fishing oysters : how many of them would be required to fish up 30,000,000 in six weeks as was done in 1881 ? What would be their cost as compared with that of the existing arrangement ? They would require as many boats as now employed ; those boats would all have to be anchored. How then will the Naturalist get over the destruction of oysters by the anchors and by the heavy-loaded shoes of the divers which would cause as much destruction of the oysters as the stones of the native divers ? Mr. Kerr, the English diver I have before alluded to, cut his pipe through by treading on it when diving in Colombo roads and nearly lost his life. The pipe must have been quite as strong as the shell of an oyster. Government should do all in its power to encourage the native divers by treating them fairly and with due consideration. It will have to be dependent on them for many years to come. It was a most timely concession made to these men, in 1880, when Government, on the recommendation of Captain Donnan and myself, allowed them to take one-third instead of one-fourth share of the oysters fished. It was gratefully acknowledged by them, and they showed their appreciation of it by the way they worked during the fishery of 1881 and the readiness with which they responded to the call at the eleventh hour to the Jubilee fishery of 1887, and again in 1888, when it was thought the oysters were all lost and nearly all hope of a fishery had been given up, and in the manner in which they worked that extraordinary fishery through.§ In Appendix 8 K is a statement of number of boatmen, divers, and their attendants, who came to the fishery of 1891. It was the largest concourse of divers, boatmen, and attendants I have seen at any fishery. Regarding Arab divers, see Appendix 8 L. Probability of Banks being replenished, and Suggestions and Recommendations for the Future. It is clear from the report of Captain Donnan that the banks were bare of oysters in March last, the broods of young oysters which appeared on the Cheval and Muttuvarattu banks two years ago having entirely disappeared and none having come on any of the other banks. 80-02 * See Appendix 7. B. f See Appendix 7, A 0. X See Appendix 4, B 1. § See Appendices 7, A 0 and A 1.My own opinion is that the banks (the Cheval and Modvagam, and perhaps the Muttuvarattu and Peria Paars) will be replenished in the ™iXl be^een 1W5 or 1906 and IMawZlhenirthe Meantime should be done by Government ? “To find them!” “Watch them!! o Fi5)l them,” I have already pointed out that the present economical and, as I ab asible and to the best advanta«e with the means and appliances at the disposal ot Government, and th^loiovdedge* (delietdive a^it yet may be) and experience gained during a century of work on the pearl b ™^ tifio researoll and experiment may hereafter tend to materially alter and modify the system 0,1 ^Kp^ cigar-shaped instead of remaining down for at most a minute mav^e able to remlin down all day picking up oysters and loading them in the above cigar-shaped f , taken to the kottus. These dreams have not been realized yet, any more than have the theories and ideas of the Naturalist been reduced to practical form and shape ; and I venture to say that if 6 th^ areever re^uce^l to any practical form and shape, it will only be after at least twenty-five years of careful 6 study, observation, and experiment. Government has to act m the l^mg present and for the near future, gradually adopting such improved appliances as science may bring to its aid, and which can profitably employed, in the same way that steam patent logs and improved compasses have been availed of with much advantage to assist at inspections and hshen , . Suggestions in regard to Vessels and Supervisor. The impossibility of carrying on inspections satisfactorily in such steamers as the “ Pearl” and “ General Havelock,” and in such hired vessels as could be picked up in Colombo, has been more than once represented to Government. It has been also pointed out that much valuable mforma i regarding the pearl banks might be obtained during the intervals of inspections if the Superintende # and Inspector were provided with a vessel specially built and equipped for service on the peail b k . It has also been urged that a vessel, so set apart for work on the banks, would be m the end mor economical than hired steamers and vessels. It seems to have been admitted previous to 1841 that it was necessary to keep a vessel constantly cruising on the banks, and a steamer was specially built m Bombay to replace the two vessels employed on that service when sold off. Mr. Vane reported the want of a vessel and was supplied (by whose fault I dormt know) with the useless “ Ceylon,” as before stated. After my experience of the inspection of November, lobA finding how unsatisfactory working in such a vessel as the “Pearl” was, I strongly urged he purchase of a vessel for service on the banks. Subsequently, when Captain Donnan and I thoug there was a likelihood of the banks being replenished in 1867, we made a joint representation to Government pointing out the necessity that existed for providing a vessel specially for work on the banks.t^;m in 1887 (I think it was, I cannot find the office copy of the letter) we made another representation pointing out in particular that the watching and guarding of the banks was being very inefficiently and unsatisfactorily carried out. , , ,, , n In 1888, at the close of the fishery, before leaving Silavatturai, I again represented the want of a vessel for work on the banks, urging at the same time that a chank fishery be established m the neighbourhood of the banks, similar to that carried on on the Tuticorin banks, which would verj probably pay the expenses of the vessel.^; (I cannot find a copy of this letter m the records lent me from the Kachcheri.) , , . , I again, after perusal of Mr. Thomas’s report, suggested the desirability of establishing a chank fishery in the neighbourhood of the banks. Appendix 1 D is an extract frorn Mr. lliomass report showing how a profitable chank fishery is worked on the Tuticorin banks. The Superintendent (Captain Phipps) of the Tuticorin banks seems to have been more fortunate in regard to a vessel than Captain Donnan and I have been on this side, a small steamer, the “ Margaret Northcote, having been specially built in and sent out from England for work on the Tuticorin banks. She rendered good service for many years, specially in connection with the chank fishery. She had good cabin accommodation and had a chart room on deck. She was schooner-rigged, but not intended for sailing without steam. She was perhaps a little too small.§ When Captain Donnan and I sent in our report of 1867,|| the little steam launch 1 have alluded to as a “ success” had not been built; the Immigrant Service which has since supplied vessels for the fisheries and inspections was then in its infancy, and had not then such comparatively fine vessels employed in it as have been chartered during the last fifteen years, and the late Golonia* steamer “Serendib” had not been built or even ordered. It is in connection with the suggestion made by Captain Donnan and myself as to the class of vessel to be supplied that, as remarked in the preface to this report, I desire to make some modification in the suggestions previously made by Captain Donnan and myself. . ... We recommended an auxiliary screw steamer of about 100 tons with a lifting screw, built on the composite principle, as the “ Serendib ” was afterwards. I was told, however, that it was found when she (the “ Serendib ”) went once to Bombay for repairs that much of the iron framework was decayed and had to be renewed. For report and recommendations regarding vessels for work on the pearl banks see Appendix 3 See Appendices 3, B ; 3, C, D, and E. § See Appendix 1, D. A, B, C, D, E, F. X See Appendix 7, B. See Appendix 3, C.I believe that the first cost of such a vessel as we recommended was the stumbling block in the way of the Government sanctioning our proposal at the time. It was considered risky apparently to expend so large a sum as £4,000 in the purchase of a vessel. Recommendations regarding Vessels to be employed on the Banks. To get over the risk, therefore, in the purchase of a vessel I would now recommend that a vessel like one of the larger vessels employed in the Immigrant Service be chartered for service on the pearl banks for a period of say five years.* She should be well found in anchors, chains, cables, sails, rigging, lanterns, and .spare stores, and have a deck below like the immigrant vessels. She should carry four (approved) boats for inspection work, one of them a serviceable gig for the Superintendent and Inspector and Supervisor (of whom hereafter). She should have decent cabin accommodation for four persons and a deck room for charts, &amp;c. She should carry a crew, including a good carpenter, sufficient to man the four boats, allowing two men in each boat to tend the divers’ lines, and leaving men enough on board to meet an emergency. Vessels and boats to be kept in good working order, clean and well found, by the owner. Buoys, buoy anchors, and cables and all stores specially required for inspections to be supplied as now by Government. She should carry six divers paid by Government for work in the intervals of inspections, six more being given retaining fees as now and paid during inspections and fisheries. The chief tindal and first and second tindals or mates might be coxswains and paid retaining fees and special allowances at fisheries and inspections as now. The divers to feed themselves. The owner to supply oil for all lights, water, and firewood. The Superintendent, Inspector, and Supervisor to find themselves in everything but lights, firewood, and water, and provide their own servants. Compasses for taking bearings, patent logs, instruments, and all appliances required by Super visor or Naturalist (if one be employed) to be supplied by Government. Vessel to work on banks for ten months, as a rule from 1st October to following 31st July, and then to be allowed to go to Kilakarai, Colombo, or other port, to be thoroughly overhauled and repaired and to give the crew leave, returning by 1st October. It would be as well perhaps sometimes to make a cruise over the banks in August and September. A vessel so fitted and provided could be chartered, I believe, for Rs. 10,000 per annum. Suggestions regarding Steam Launch. All inspection work and work at fisheries could be done with the vessel, with the assistance of a tender in the shape of a steam launch, to be attached to her. She would, moreover, be an efficient guard vessel. A steam launch like the one I have referred to as supplied in 1874, or one on the same lines a little larger and a little more powerful, with disconnecting screw, should be attached as above suggested to the guard vessel. Such a vessel would be most useful, not only at inspections and fisheries, but at intervals of inspections. The tindal might be one of the retained coxswains. In our letter of 27th March, 1867, Captain Donnan and I recommended the employment of a captain for the vessel on £240 sterling per annum'.! I would now, however, recommend instead that an officer, to be styled “ Supervisor and Assistant to the Inspector ” (viz., the Master Attendant), be appointed on a fair salary, say Rs. 5,000 per annum. If such an appointment be made care should be taken to avoid the mistakes made in 1832, when a Supervisor was for the first time appointed. Great care will have to be exercised in the selection of a person for this office, in defining his position in relation to the Superintendent and Inspector, and the duties he will be expected to perform. He should be made to understand that his work lies on the banks, and that he will be expected to be as a rule at sea in his ship, making occasional visits to the shore, and not on shore lounging in an arm chair at Arippu stuffing birds in Pulipanchaodai, or amusing himself at Pukulam or Marichchukkaddi, making onlv occasional visits to the ship. He should be made to keep a log, entering in it daily all occurrences' sending a copy to the Master Attendant at the end of each month to be laid before Government When the vessel goes for the annual repairs he should wait on the Master Attendant, lav before him all information he may have obtained, charts, &amp;c., and before returning to his station he should a fain wait on the Master Attendant and receive any instructions that officer may have to ffive him Inspection should be carried out by the Master Attendant in the ship with the assistance of the Supervisor. Of course, when the vessel is away for repairs the Supervisor should be allowed two months’ leave of absence. ' ... , . . i i „ I claim for the suggestions that I have made regarding vessels for service on the banks that (If adopted) they would in the end be found more economical and more efficient than the present system of hiring vessels for inspections and fisheries, and hiring boatmen for temporary emplovment in the boats. ^ I believe inspections could be more satisfactorily conducted and the banks would be efficiently guarded by the plan proposed, while in the intervals of inspections much information regarding the enemies of the oysters, viz., currents, floods, skates, &amp;c., might be obtained^ chartered ve ssel would carry within herself all that is necessary for inspections, viz., boats boats’ crews buoys, cables, anchors, and any apparatus that may be necessary for making obserVations and experiments. She would also be a comfortable vessel for those who may have to reside mjiei\^ advantao . e WO uld be that the vessel would be always on the spot ready to take artvantafe of anv fine weather for inspection work, whereas at present much valuable time is sometimes lost before the inspection vessel gets to the banks.J * I find that in the recommendation I make in regard to the vessel I follow very much the suggestions made by Captain Steuart page 82, viz.I subsequently suggested, that if a Naval officer should be appointed Superintendent of Pearl Fisheries he should not permanently reside at Arippo, but be placed in command of a good vessel capable of carrying five or six boats with crew and divers, as ships fitted for the whale fishery carry their boats and crews, in order that pearl banks might be searched for on all parts of the coast of Ceylon, f See Appendix B, C. J See Appendix 3. F and F 1. 1869.( 20 ) The steam launch would be able to do all the steaming, towing, &amp;c., at inspections that may be required The onteide cost I estimate at Rs. 25,000, exclusive of the first cost of the steam launch, viz.:— Vessel Supervisor ... ••• Steam launch, annual expenditure Buoys, apparatus, divers, coxswains Rs. 10,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 Total ... 25,000 T , , ,,, •i.v, OOAnnT nv the cost would not much exceed Rs. 20,000, as I think it woul?be7ouu h d 0 7oSle toTharL a visel for Rs. 8,000, and the annual charge for the steam launch ought not to be so much as Rs. 5,000. Work on Banks to be carried on as much as possible under Canvas. Work on the banks should be carried on ^ “^e availing ^ be required in addition to tie ‘'The clfoT^ecS^U^^treUndboats before 1841, asgiven by Captain Steuart (p. 33), amounted to £1,600 per annum ; but to that must be added 7ar at^easfc For the shape of privileges at the fisheries, which amounted fro , . r'.op-p. -.Ly 1050 d instance, the amount realized by the fishery headmen during the fisheries of I 800 , 1 85 r j ’ 1 ^ I860 would have given them at the rate of £300 to £400 a year from 1837 to i860, ihis amount had to be divided between five of them according to their rank. Supervisor: care necessary in selection of Person for. Of course much (I may almost say all) must depend on the character, disposition, ami qualifi cations of the officer who may be appointed Supervisor, if such an appointment be made. He mus be a steady man of temperate habits, zealous in the discharge of his duties, and possessed of tact and judgment to deal with the native crew of his vessel and the launch and with the divers and boat men at an inspection and a fishery. European Divers. An intelligent, well-behaved, professional European diver would no doubt at times and on certain occasions be of great service on the banks. It is absurd to suppose, however, that loafers nicked up in the streets of Colombo, who had never had a diving dress on them, and who had never seen a pearl oyster or been on a pearl bank in their lives, could be suddenly transformed into divers and be expected to give intelligent and reliable reports of the state of the banks. The Ceylon Government has not been fortunate in the matter of the European divers employed on the pearl banks. Europeans or Eurasians of intemperate habits are worse than useless, they are positively mischievous. Note. From a memorandum in Captain Steuart’s “ Account,” pages 74 and 75,1 find that the estimated cost of guarding, surveying, and managing the pearl banks amounted to per annum £1,321. This included pay of Supervisor £200, diving bell expenses £47, and cost of vessel £885. As regards vessels, he made the following remark, viz.:—“For several years two Govern ment vessels were alternately employed guarding the pearl banks and in other duties, such as the convevances of stores and troops. Now we have only the smaller one, and she is occasionally employed on other Government duty. But as I am sure it is absolutely necessary to have a vessel for the pearl banks, I include the annual expense of this vessel.” The estimated expenses for nine years, from 1826 to 1834, amounted to £13,231, including work ing charges of diving bell. Including cost of diving bell the estimate comes to £15,000 ; annual charge £1,600. Considering the increase in the price of labour, cost of materials, &amp;c., since 1834, the estimate I have given, which includes the working of a steam launch, is not out of the way, viz., Rs. 25,000. Captain Steuart’s estimate (at present rate of wages) should be increased at least 25 per cent., and to this should be added the amount received by headmen as privileges which have been abolished, all remuneration now being paid in money. Permanent Marks recommended, at Kudiramalai, &amp;c. Much of the mystery which seemed to hang over the pearl banks was owing, as I believe, to the want of defined landmarks. From the account given by Captain Steuart of the wrong bank having been fished in 1836, the one to be fished having been missed and two beds of young oysters fished instead, I feel satisfied that the mistake made arose from the want of fixed landmarks to which bearings could be taken. Sketches of the land referred to by Captain Steuart as having been given by him to the Supervisor for his guidance are all very well in their way, but sketches of certain objects on the land taken by one person from the main top of a small brig, the land and the objects being scarcely visible from the deck, are not very reliable guides for another person to find beds of oysters on a bank twelve miles from the land. From my first experience of work on the pearl banks during the inspection of November, 1862, I have felt that certain fixed, well-defined, unmistakable landmarks were much needed, to which bearings might be taken from all parts of the banks. I was much struck with the difficulty experienced by the Supervisor, Mr. Worsley, in finding the bank it was proposed to fish in 1863, although apparently it had been very carefully inspected by him in March, 1862, and I was informed on my return from England in 1861 that the fishery of I860( 21 ) on the Modiagam, which yielded Rs. 360,000, was nearly lost, because the bed of oysters to be fished could not be found till search had been made for it for three days.* The old Doric building, which has now almost disappeared, was built, I believe, to serve as a mark as well as a residence. There are seven points which serve as marks for the banks : Kuthiraimalai, Pukulam, Kallar hfS, Kondatchy hill, Kurusadie at Silavatturai, the Doric, the Arippu tope. Kuthiraimalai is a long ridge of high land stretching over to the south and west from the Modragam river forming a little bay sheltered during the south-west monsoon. It looks like an enormous alligator from the banks. There are three bumps as it were on its back, and there was always a difficulty in fixing on the exact bump or spot to which bearings should be taken. Mr. Yane recommended the erection of a tower or flagstaff on this spot to mark it. A flagstaff was erected on it, but it has long since fallen down. A trig tower has been erected behind it. I think the top of the tower is visible over the high, ground, and -if it were strengthened and raised a few feet it would make a good permanent mark. The flagstaff could not be seen distinctly from the banks. Pukulam is a small cocoanut tope on the seashore between the two outlets of the Modragam river. If Marichchukkaddi be made the headquarters of future fisheries, a small tower should be erected on the high ground on the right of the river from which a light should be displayed during fisheries to guide vessels and the diving boats when coming in late to the anchorage. Kallar hill is a long stretch of high sandy ground on the right of the river. There are three hillocks on it, and there was always a question to which one bearings had to be taken. A tower has been erected on the centre hillock, as recommended by Mr. Yane : it was raised 6 feet in 1890, and it is now a good landmark. Kondatchy hill is a piece of high ground at the back of the village. A small tower should be erected on its summit where the wooden trig station was. Kurusadie is a tope of cocoanut trees in the graveyard at Silavatturai. There is now a very good mark for Silavatturai in a tope planted near the shore. The Doric is now in ruins, very little of it being left. Arippu tope is a long cocoanut tope, a good mark for working on the northern part of the banks. The Supervisor’s house is close by. Each person seemed to have had his own points in the tope to which he took bearings. One took the bearings to the east, another to the west, another to the centre. However, cocoanut cultivation is increasing in that direction. The east, centre, and west of this year will not be the east, centre, and west of a few years hence. A tower should be erected on the Bastian of the old Fort, a few yards from the Supervisor’s house., There is plenty of material at hand in the remains of the old Doric. I wrote fully pointing out the necessity for permanent marks at Kuthiraimalai, Kondatchy, and Arippu at the close of the fishery of 1888 before leaving Silavatturai. I cannot lay my hands on the copy of that letter. It was referred to Captain Donnan, who however said he did not require them, as he had his marks and could find his way about the banks. This may be the case, and from his familiarity with the coast after thirty-eight years’ work on the banks I have no doubt he could almost find his way to any part of any bank by the appearance of objects on the land. This would not at first be the case with his successor, who would require some distinct marks to work by. Captain Donnan, it is true, laid down a buoy on the Karativu shoal in j 86 .j as a mark from which to inspect the northern banks. This buoy was found exceedingly useful, as it formed an excellent mark for working over the banks.t Buoys are however apt to go adrift altogether, or to drift from their position as this one did in 1867, and if this occurred it would cause much inconvenience if there were no other marks. Fixed points on the land are therefore, in my opinion, needed as well as the buoy. For the Muttuvarattu and the banks south of it there are good and prominent landmarks. Suggestions that Chanfo Fishevy be established in the neighbouvhood of Banks. Mr. Yane, in his diary of 1862, suggested that a chank fishery should be established in the neighbourhood of the pearl banks, the then newly-appointed Supervisoi being placed in chaige of it. In 1887-88 I again brought the matter under the notice of Government, and subsequently, after a perusal of Mr. Thomas’s report, I submitted a scheme for the consideration of Government.! There used to be a chank fishery in the neighbourhood of the pearl banks, I think to about 1832.6 I have not been able to get any connected report of it; I have only seen detached papers. The right of fishing the chanks was rented to the leading man of the divers m Kilakarai. Why it was abolished I do not know. Perhaps it was because the Government vessels “ Wellington ” and “ Anne ” having been sold off—the “ Seaforth ” converted into a mail packet and the Supervisor discharged—there were no means left for keeping a watch on the proceedings of the renter, who, if not watched, would have poached on the pearl banks. i ^ n . i n i i j? A very profitable chank fishery is carried on in the neighbourhood of the pearl banks of Tuticorin. 1 annex (Appendix 1 D) extract from Mr. Thomas’s report regarding the chank fishery If a' vessel be chartered, a steam launch be purchased, and a Supervisor for the Ceylon banks appointed, as I have suggested, a chank fishery somewhat on the lines of that on the Tuticorin banks, might be profitably, and with much advantage, worked m the neighbourhood of the Ceylon banks. Mr. Thomas is wrong in saying that there is no chank fishery m Ceylon. There is a chank fishery north of Mannar island and round to Mullaittivu on the east. It is open to all divers from India. It is chiefly worked however, hy the Mohammedan divers of Kilakarai, and recently hy some of the Arab divers who settled m Vannarponnai after the fishery of 1891. It is worked under the provisions of the Ordinance No. 18 ot 189U. Government even now realizes about Rs. 4,000 per annum on the royalty levied at the Custom house on chanks. T ^ About 2,000,000 chanks are exported from Jaffna annually to Calcutta. * See Appendices 4, F 1 and F 2. f See Appendix 4, L. f See Appendix 7, B. § See also Appendix 1, D.( 22 ) Note. —In a report by Lieutenant-Colonel Colebrooke, dated the 24th December, 1831, on the Pearl Fishery, given as an appendix to Captain Steuart’s Account of the Pearl Fishery, I find the following paragraph, page 66 :— The Government still retains its monopoly of the sea-shells called “ chanks, ” which are used as ornaments by the Hindus. The chank fishery, which in 1816 produced a revenue of £6,700, has declined to £37 per annum. As the divers from the coast can easily collect the chanks, and as they are also procured by digging for them in the Jaiffna District, it has been difficult to protect the monopoly ; and it would tend to promote the settlement on the coast of useful and industrious people if this restriction were removed. The chank fishers are also accustomed to dive for the pearl oysters. I think there must be some mistake or omission in connection with the figures, £6,700 given as the amount received in 1816 on account of the chank fishery. I suspect it must have been the total of a few years and not the return only of one year. I presume it is only the chank fishery in the neighbourhood of the pearl banks that is alluded to as having yielded £6,700. Dead chanks are only found in the lake in Jaffna, and recently in the vicinity of the island of Punkudutivu. The chank fishery and digging for dead chanks north of Mannar island were regulated down to 1890 under the provisions of Ordinances Nos. 4 and 5 of 1842. These were repealed by Ordinance No. 18 of 1890, which prohibits chank fishing on the south of Mannar island in the neighbourhood of the pearl banks. Arab Divers. I give in Appendix 8 L extract from my report on the Pearl Fishery of 1891 regarding the Arab divers. I entered fully in that report into the circumstances under which these men came, the misconduct of some of them at the fishery of 1890, and the attempt (at the instigation, as I believe of the ringleaders in the irregularities of 1890) to bring in a large body of these men to the Marich- chukkaddi fishery of 1891. I strongly resisted their being allowed to come. I do not believe that one-half of these men who came to Tuticorin and went up to Kilakarai to try and induce the Kilakarai divers to bring them over were really divers. I have every reason to believe that they were Bombay thieves, robbers, and vagabonds brought over by the man I have alluded to to rob and steal at the fishery. A carefully selected body of Arab divers under strict supervision would be useful at a fishery, as they are undoubtedly good divers, but they must be well watched. I have stated all I have to say on the subject in the report referred to. Site of Gamp for future Fisheries: whether it shall be Silavatturai or Marichchukhaddi. I refer to this because I wrote as follows in my report of the Fishery of 1890 :— I annex a chart showing the portion of the bank fished and the positions of the several banks'—the Cheval Paar, the Modragam, &amp;c.—in regard to Marichchukkaddi, and a map showing how the camp was laid out at Marichchuk- kaddi, both drawn for me by Mr. J. de Neise, draughtsman of the Provincial Road Committee, acting as second clerk of the Pearl Fishery Kachcheri. Marichchukkaddi, or Pukulam, was selected as the site for the headquarters of the pearl fishery as being the only place from which the Muttuvarattu Paar could be fished, excepting Dutch Bay, to which the merchants and divers all declared they would not go, the only recommendation in its favour being its proximity to the bank. After their experience of Marichchukkaddi during the recent fishery, the merchants to whom I have spoken on the subject have given it as their opinion that Marichchukkaddi is preferable even to Silavatturai, as there is much more room for spreading out the camp. This opinion was also expressed by one of the chiefs of the divers, the only drawback being, as he said, the want of a sufficient supply of water for bathing. The divers, he informed me, required a plunge in fresh water on their return from the bank, and if they could not get this they were likely to get sick. I have no doubt that the water supply could be very much improved at very little cost. The deficiency this year was caused by the failure of rain in November and December last, and until the close of the fishery. I would submit for the consideration of Government the desirability of making Marichchukkaddi the head quarters for future^ fisheries. All the banks can, in my opinion, be more easily worked from Marichchukkaddi than Silavatturai. I he approach to it from the sea is clear of rocks and reefs. Vessels can come close in and find shelter bttle bay under Kutiramalai. The approach to Silavatturai is, on the contrarv, somewhat dangerous, being studded over with rocks, and close to to the Arippu reef, and there is there no sheltered bay, which is a great drawback. J Silavatturai has always been the site of the camp for the fisheries during the British occupa tion, except for the small fishery of 1832, when the camp was somewhere in the neighbourhood of Dutch Bay and the three fisheries from the Muttuvarattu Paar in 1889, 1890, and 1891. The advantages of Silavatturai over Marichchukkaddi for working the Cheval, Modragam, and Periya Paars are— (1) lhat it has comparatively populous Moorish and other villages in its immediate neigh- bourhood from which supplies and a certain amount of labour can be drawn. ( 2 ) It is the old established port. (3) The water supply is now more certain, or I may say less uncertain, than that of Marich chukkaddi. Its disadvantages, as compared with Marichchukkaddi. are— (1) The greater distance from the above-mentioned banks. (2) The difficulty experienced by the boats in getting out to those banks if the sea breeze keeps up to late in the night, and of getting in from the banks if the land wind sets m earl y i 11 the afternoon when the boats are returning from the banks. It has often occurred that many boats have not been able to get out because the sea breeze has \ept up till the following morning, whereas they could very easily have run out Marichchukkaddi; and again, boats have been very often driven down to ilarichchukkaddi from near Silavatturai when the land wind has suddenly caught them when coming in. (3) Its approaches being somewhat dangerous from reefs and rocks. 1The Muttuvarattu Paar cannot he worked from Silavatturai. The fishery of 1889 was worked from Dutch Bay. Except for its proximity to the bank, it was a most undesirable place in every way for a fishery camp. For the fisheries of 1890 and 1891 Marichchukkaddi was chosen. The water supply at Silavatturai was as precarious as that of Marichchukkaddi before 1859, the camp having been dependent on a large tank close to the bazaar. In 1859, however, it was discovered that good water could be got by sinking wells all along the broad stretch of sand between the beach and bazaar and divers : quarters. In Marichchukkaddi there is a very fine deep tank reserved for drinking water ; and although there was a failure of rain in 1889-90, it retained enough water from the rains of the previous season to supply the camp during the fishery of 1890. In 1891 there was an abundant supply of water every where, as there had been heavy rain. I doubt if it would be possible to get water by sinking wells at Marichchukkaddi. One well was sunk in 1891 at Mullikkulam, close to Pukulam ; the water was good, but the supply was not large. I tried experiments in a water-course, but the water was brackish. The divers require a plunge in fresh water when they come off the banks. A tank was made for them, and the people of the camp, in Silavatturai, in 188i, by throwing a dam across a piece of low land through which a channel carried rain water to the sea. This was called “ Donnan’s tank.” A similar but much larger tank was made in the same way on the east of the town in 1888. These both filled when the rains set in, and afforded a good supply of water for bathing. Both these tanks were breached by the heavy rains of 1891. I caused a similar tank to be made in Marichchukkaddi. Owing to the failure of rain, however, there was very little water in it in 1890. In 1891 it filled well and the heavy squalls during the fishery kept it full. I pointed out to the Adigar of Musali a site for another good tank near the Government kottus, and arranged with him to construct a dam there in the event of a fishery in 1892. By the heavy rains of 1891 in November and December the bund of the drinking water tank at Marichchukkaddi was breached, so that if there had been a fishery in 1892 there might have been some inconvenience. I obtained a grant of Rs. 1,000 from Government for its repair in 1892, and Seemanpillai, Adigar of Musali, repaired it and built two spills, one at each end. The disadvantages of Silavatturai might be got over to a certain extent, (1) by the employment of one or two steam tugs during the fishery ; ( 2 ) by blasting the reefs and rocks from the approaches ; ( 3 ) by placing a permanent mark on the tail of the reef. The drinking water tank at Marichchukkaddi could be made safe from breach by the erection of a solid stone bund in place of the present earthen bund. I could not recommend Dutch Bay, in its present state, being again made the site of a fishery camp after the experience of 1889. If the fishing of the Muttuvarattu Paar be again carried on from Marichchukkaddi (or Pukulam), as I believe it must be, the Ippantivu channel should be deepened to 6 feet at low water. If the matter of the water supply could be settled, Marichchukkaddi is, in my opinion, the site for the camp for all fisheries from all the banks north of Kalpitiya, except, of course, for the small banks north of Arippu, of which there is no record of their having been fished that I am aware of. Before Dutch Bay is ever made the site of a camp again measures should be taken to have the long sandy spit, which forms the bay, planted up with cocoanut and other trees. (See my report of fishery of 1889 regarding the very great discomfort consequent on the absence of trees.) Whether Silavatturai or Marichchukkaddi be selected as the site for the future camp, provision must be made for the repair of the two bathing tanks at Silavatturai or the repair of the tank made in 1890 at Marichchukkaddi and the construction of the one the site for which I pointed out to the Adigar. The Appendix 8 G will show how necessary a tank is for the divers to plunge in when they come in off the banks. Sanitation. Sanitation should be strictly enforced at fisheries, and liberal expenditure should be incurred in carrying out sanitary measures, especially when there are such large assemblages of all classes as there were in 1881, 1888, 1889, and 1891. In 1891 there were at one time of the fishery over 30,000 people assembled at Marichchukkaddi. It would be a great boon to the people if some provision could be made for “ public latrines ” in the vicinity of the camp. I could not see my way to doing anything in this connection. Several plans were suggested to me, but it was not found possible to carry them out with the means available. I believe I could now arrange for some accommodation of the sort by the use of “ roofing felt ” now sold in rolls in Colombo.'' Less Inflammable Material than Gadjans and Mats to he used in Temporary Buildings. If this or some other material less inflammable than cadjans and mats, and not much more expensive could be gradually introduced at fisheries for the roofing and dividing into compaitments of temporary buildings, it would be a great improvement and prove of vast benefit to the people, not only in a sanitary point of view, but as affording them comparative security from fire The great risk of fire at a fishery has always been a cause for much anxiety. At almost every fishery a fire has occurred. A somewhat destructive one occurred at Dutch Bay m 1889, and one that created much alarm for a time at Marichchukkaddi in 1891. Permanent Buildings not required. Heavy expenditure, however, on permanent buildings, such as has been incurred in past years at Silavatturai, Arippu, and Pulipanchodai, should be strictly avoided Permanent buildings are not required, and Expenditure on such buildings would be a mistake if they are erected merely for use at fisheries. * I * „ c , , , ailTmrn nf Anderson’s, in coils of 25 yards ,32 inches wide, 90 lb. weight, Rs. 10.

F. Valuable Information for Superintendents, Inspectors, and Supervisors found in Steuart's “ Account ” and Thomas's “ Rejoort:' Superintendents, Inspectors, and Supervisors will find for their guidance much useful information regarding the pearl banks and the habits of the pearl oysters in Captain Steuart’s “ Account of the Pearl Fisheries ” and Mr. Thomas’s “ Report to the Madras Government” refer^. to in the preface and body of this report, and from which extracts are given in the appendix. Changes since Steuart's “ Account' was ivritten. It must be borne in mind, however, that many changes have taken place in matters of detail since Captain Steuart wrote his “Account.” For instance :— Headmen no longer employed.—Fisher headmen, Adappens, &amp;c., are no longer employed. They have been succeeded by coxswains, who receive retaining fees. European Boats employed instead of Native Boats. —The clumsy native inspection boats have been replaced by European boats. Steamers at Inspections. —Steamers have been availed of at inspections. Remuneration by Privileges abolished. —The system of remuneration by privileges and by oysters taken from the divers’ shares has been very properly abolished. The last remuneration by privileges was in 1863. Donations to Temples abolished. —All donations to temples have been abolished. No privilege has been allowed to any temple since 1837. Divers allowed One-third instead of One-fourth Share since 1880. —The divers now receive one-third share of the oysters and not only one-fourth as previous to the fishery of 1881, and they are not subjected to any deduction from their share for remuneration to officers. They receive their full shares at the kottus, remove them, and do what they like with them. European Boats gradually displacing Native Boats. Native diving boats, as described by Captain Steuart (pages 9 and 10), are giving place by degrees to European boats, and the limit of ten divers and five stones to a boat is not now strictly adhered to. Large cotton cargo boats come now from Tuticorin with twenty and more divers in them. A large number of boats on the European model now come from Paumben instead of the old native boats. There is a great advantage in these boats, as they can beat against a head wind. I have referred to this change in my reports from 1887. Shark Charmer. A shark charmer has not been employed on the bank since 1859. Renting System abolished before 1837 should not be reverted to. The renting system, viz., the sale of the right to fish a bank to one person, as described by Captain Steuart, was (very properly, as I believe) abolished before 1837, and should not be reverted to. Since that time the oysters have been sold by public auction by the thousand to the highest bidders. An attempt was made by some merchants, I believe, to get the Muttuvarattu Paar on rent in 1889 and thus secure the monopoly of the fisheries from that bank in 1889, 1890, and 1891. Monopoly of Fishery to one Person, Firm, or Class, directly or indirectly, not to be allowed. Caie should, in my opinion, be taken to prevent any one person, or any one firm or class of merchants, seeming to himself or themselves a monopoly of any fishery, either directly by purchas ing the light (on rent) to fish a bank, or indirectly by obtaining the right throughout a fishery to the Government share of a large proportion of the advertised number of boats at a fixed rate, as was the case in 1857 and 1858, and thus virtually getting a monopoly of a fishery. Summary of Suggestions in Mr. Thomas's Report. Appendix 1 F is a copy of the summary of recommendations in Mr. Thomas’s report. Manv ot them are similar to the suggestions I have made. Some refer only to the Tuticorin banks.* Artificial Culture and Spat Catching. I 30dy , 0f report Mr. Thomas has entered at length into “ Artificial Culture,” page 27, pa agraph 89 (see Appendix 1 G), and in connection with it on spat catching ; and in his summary pfaoefunhTa sLnMflc Department 1 ”* “ Spa * 0atCMng ! ” XXIV ' “ TI -^o,e Inquiry should be I trustfmay be S0 ° P ® ° f the re£eremce t0 me “ Arti it 2l l ^ Ure ' j concur with Mr. Thomas in the opinion expressed bv him that nrtfitaffip fiSfirv T Z * 't ^ em ^ neratlv ^y carried on in the millions necessary to make a in a vpt-v limitprl* vei mnc ^ ^ ^ can be carried on at all, except as an experiment able cost - &lt; &lt; un er ver 5' careful and constant supervision, and consequently at consider- c■ iri*vi tip- 7 ^ ^7^!'' n ^ catc ^ ng ma y be useful to a Naturalist, for experimental purposes, in banks with smtpnnrd +* Tn U d ° no ^ ^ e ^ eve that it will be ever found possible to replenish ?hat it^aVbe flepi^ n ^ ;Y an , ner s ^ ested and deposited on them.

Spasmodic efforts such as that made in 1865, when a Naturalist Ytr'isbi ought out 01 a limited period without previous preparation, and without the necessary appliances and apparatus to carry on his researches, would be, in my opinion, a simple waste of money. ^ ive yeais, the period for which the Naturalist was engaged, does not embrace the supposed term &amp; pearl oyster s existence, ’ viz., seven years. In five years, therefore, a Naturalist would not be able to complete his researches and be in a position to lay anything definite before Government. The head of such a Department should be placed in such a position and be so provided with boats, establishment, apparatus, and appliances, as to be enabled to work independently of any other. As suggested by Mr. Ihomas, a bank or banks should be specially assigned to him on which to carry on his researches and experiments. Cost of stick Department not to be charged to expenses of Pearl Fishery. If such a Department be established the cost should not be charged against the “ Expenses of the Pearl Fishery, as if charged against the “ Pearl Fishery ” it would give rise to erroneous ideas abroad as to the expenditure incurred on account of inspections and fisheries and the nett proceeds of the fisheries. Whatever maybe the results of such inquiry if taken up, I feel satisfied, as I have before remarked that it can only be after some years of careful study, research, and experiment before anything definite and practical can be arrived at. As it is, the two Naturalists, Dr. Kelaart and Mr. Holdsworth, have disagreed on two important points, viz., the power of locomotion possessed by the pearl oysters ; replenishing the banks by spat catching. In the meanwhile, as regards the pearl oysters, the business of the Government, as remarked by Mr. Worsley, is to “ find them,” “ watch them,” “ fish them.” Summary of Recommendations and Suggestions. I would recommend— (1) That an inspection be made of the banks in November next, in order to ascertain if oysters have come on any of them since the inspection of March. (2) That a careful and thorough inspection of all the banks be made in February, March, and April, 1900. (3) Inspections be made regularly in future in November and March of each year. Captain Donnan and I, in 1864, recommended that regular inspections* should be made twice a year ; and Mr. Thomas, in his Report on the Tuticorin Banks, points out that more frequent inspections are necessary.t (4) That careful records be kept of all the banks, the state an^l condition of each bank being carefully entered up after each inspection. (5) That special endeavour be made to secure some of the minute real spat of the peaid oyster (see under head “ False Spat ” and Appendix 1, A). Superintendents and Inspectors should be careful not to mistake “ false spat ” for “ real spat.” ( 6 ) That a vessel be specially chartered for service on the pearl banks, to be employed continuously on the banks, carrying inspection boats, buoys, cables, anchors, and all apparatus and implements required for inspections, observations, experiments, &amp;c. (7) That a steam launch be ordered from England and attached to the vessel as a tender. ( 8 ) That a supervisor of the pearl banks be appointed, who shall be Assistant to the Master Attendant and the Inspector of the Banks. His Duties. —He shall be made to understand that his work will be on the banks in the vessel, and that he will be expected to work in the vessel provided for him, and take up his quarters in her and not on shore. He shall at inspections and fisheries assist the Master Attendant and carry out his instructions. In intervals of inspections he shall (whenever the weather permits) cruise over the banks, observe what is going on, and carefully record all that comes under his notice, specially in regard to currents, floods, skates, and other enemies of the pearl oyster. He shall in particular ascertain if the flood waters during heavy rains reach the banks and in any way injuriously effect the oysters. If a chank fishery be established in the neighbourhood of the banks, he shall supervise it and shall see that no poaching is carried on on the banks. He shall carry on his work as much as possible under canvas, and shall avoid, as far as possible, anchoring his vessel on the banks themselves. He shall examine the ground carefully round each bank and beyond the banks, and see if there are any patches of rock hitherto unknown, or any deposit of oysters on sand or rock beyond the banks. He shall also make a careful examination of the ground north of Mannar island in the neighbourhood of the islands Delft, &amp;c., and round the east coast to Trincomalee. , . . He shall carefully watch if young oysters float in from the gulf as occurred m 1863 (see Appendix 4, I) and make whatever observations he can m regard to deposit of He sh°alfkee S p a^og, carefully noting in it everything that occurs, sending monthly a copy to the Master Attendant and Inspector to be laid before Government. ... He shall see that the vessel and the launch and boats are kept m proper and serviceable order and the crews in discipline ; and that there is no reckless waste or misuse of the property of either the owner of the ship or of Government. (9) That permanent marks be erected at Arippu, Kondatchy, and Kudiramalai, and a buoy placed on the Karativu shoal.J See Appendix 5, B. f See Appendix 1, F. 1 See Appendix 4, L, 80-02( 26 ) (10) That by degrees the position and contour of all the banks be carefully laid out on a working chart on a large scale of all the banks from bearings taken to the above marks and to the existing marks and the buoy on the Karativu shoal. „ , rn • i in-. -u (11) That a chank fishery, somewhat on the lines of the TuticOrm chank fashery, be established in the neighbourhood of the Ceylon pearl banks south of Arippu. i ^ i ^ ( 12 ) That great care and caution be exercised in allowing the Arab divers to come to the fishery. (13) Site for camp for future fisheries to be decided on, viz., whether it shall be Silavatturai or Marichchukkadi. , . „ „ (14) Tanks for bathing should be provided, more especially for divers. (15) Sanitation to be strictly enforced. (16) Public latrines should be provided in vicinity of camp, if possible. (17) Less inflammable materials than cadjans and mats should be made use of. Suggested that roofing felt be used. , ^ . (18) Superintendents, Inspectors, and Supervisors should study Captain bteuart s Account” and Mr. Thomas’s “ Report on the Pearl Fishery,” noting carefully changes in certain points since Steuart’s “ Account ” was written. Remarks in connection with Mr. Thomas’s suggestions regarding artificial culture, spat catching, and Scientific Department. Conclusion. 1 cannot conclude this letter without some expression of my deep sense of obligation to Captain Donnan, Master Attendant of Colombo and Inspector of the Pearl Banks, for much kindly advice and support, valuable assistance, and cordial co-operation which I have received from him, not only as Superintendent of the Pearl Fishery, but also as Government Agent and Master Attendant of the Ports of the Northern Province. It was my good fortune, as Superintendent of the Fishery, to have been associated with Captain Donnan, as Inspector of the Pearl Banks, for over thirty years, from November, 1863, to November, 1895. We worked several inspections together and carried through ten fisheries, in regard to the last of which (that of 1891) we had the privilege of carrying out the last, the largest, and most remunera tive fishery of the century and of the British occupation. At the close of that fishery we parted from each other, with much regret, on the beach at Marichchukkaddi, feeling as we did that it was the last time we should work a fishery together. I am, &amp;c., W. C. TWYNAM. P.S.—Attached to Appendix 7, D, is a chart marked Appendix 7, E, of the pearl banks, showing the set of the current which carried away the oysters from the Cheval Paar in 1888. I do not pretend that this chart is strictly or anything like strictly accurate, but it is sufficiently so to show the relative positions of the banks, and to give some idea of the manner in which the Cheval bank was swept by the current in 1888.APPENDIX No. 1.

The Spat. To be able to report a fall of spat, it is essential that the officer in charge of pearl fisheries should be able to recognize a pearl oyster at that early age when it must necessarily be very minute. Turning to “ Sketches of Natural History of Ceylon,” by Sir J. Emerson Tennent, K.C.S., L.L.D., &amp;c., I find the pearl oyster “ illustrated from drawings made for the official Inspector, and exhibiting the ascertained size of the pearl oyster at every period of its growth from, the ‘ spat ’ to the mature shell.” The drawings are executed by G. B. Sowerby, a name that is sufficient guarantee for the accurate delineation of the subject presented for illustration. Put forward by official authority, the then Inspector of Pearl Banks at Colombo, accepted and, so to say, endorsed by Sir J. E. Tennent after visiting the fisheries,* and so excellently illustrated that the shells indicated could not be mistaken, it is not surprising that from that date to this the shells declared to be the spat of the pearl oyster should have been accepted as such ; notwithstanding, Captain Phipps, the Superintendent of Pearl Banks at Tuticorin, twice challenged the dictum and gave what I conceive to be very sound reasons for his dissent. In the course of an official report addressed to the Collector of Tinnevelly on April 26, 1867, and forwarded in due course to Government and printed in G. 0., Revenue Department, July 11, 1867, No. 1,541, he wrote :— “Regarding the young oysters found on the Tuticorin and Yypar banks, I think it advisable to mention that the opinion that those small shells are the spat of the pearl oyster is derived from the divers and fishermen on the coast and the Jaddy Talaven. Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys, to whom some of the young shells have been submitted by Mr. Markham, is also of the same opinion. During the past eight years I have visited every bank on the coast once each year and somtimes oftener. I am, therefore, a little doubtful of this conclusion. In the year 1860, on one of the banks off Yambar, spat of a similar description was found, and at a later date a bank off Tuticorin was covered in the same way. Last year the Paumben banks were also in the same state ; when next examined the spat had all disappeared. What makes it still appear to me more doubtful is that amongst these millions of so-called pearl oysters I have found a few which I know to be the real pearl shells. There is also another reason. During the past few days, being anxious to bring my report to a late date, I passed over some of the Tuticorin banks. Though the weather was fine, the sea was not clear. This prevented a very careful examination. On sending the divers down on banks which when last examined contained young oysters, none were found. On the Cruchan Paar they were as thick as ever, but to my surprise there was no difference in their size and no change in their appearance. The time that has elapsed since they were first discovered is quite sufficient for the change which I looked for to have taken place, and I must add that until further examination I shall remain doubtful of their being the true pearl oysters. I learn from Ceylon that a large quantity of spat, similar to that just mentioned, has been found on the Ceylon pearl banks, and which has been considered to be that of the pearl oyster. I trust that this may prove correct. It must be remembered that the actual change from spat to the pearl oyster has never been observed either by Mr. Holdsworth or myself. Under these circumstances it would be advisable to wait and see the state of the banks at the next examination before coming to any conclusion, and thus prevent future disappointment.” Again, in a subsequent report, dated November 18, 1867, No. 32, and printed in G. 0. dated December 14, 1867, No. 2,980, Revenue Department, Captain Phipps writes “ I have the honour to inform you that during the whole of the past week I was employed inspecting the pearl banks off Tuticorin and Yypar. The weather having been particularly favourable and the sea clear, the examination was carefully made, and with the steamer “ Godavery” I was able to go over each bank several times, using the dredge. I regret exceedingly to have to report that the state of the banks is again very discouraging. The large quantity of what in the early part of the year covered the banks, and was supposed to be the pearl oyster fry, has entirely disappeared, and they are now quite bare ; on some I found a very few young pearl oysters, but the quantity was so small as to be of no value. “ From the entire disappearance of the supposed pearl oyster fry, I am of opinion that calling it by this name was a mistake, the fry being that of some other mollusc, and this would show that the divers of the coast know really very little of the appearance of the pearl oyster when young. During the last few days those of the latter that I have found present quite a different appearance, although no larger in size than the false fry ; of this, it is remarkable that great quantities have been found, and also of the Chinese window sort in this harbour over the sand and mud, some of which I have had placed in the nursery and in other parts for observation. In my former report I mentioned that large quantities of a similar kind have been found on the Ceylon pearl banks, and I am now anxiously looking forward to the result of the next inspection on that coast.’ Attention having thus been drawn to the matter, Captain Donnan, who succeeded Captain Steuart as Inspector of Pearl Fisheries at Colombo, took some of the challenged spat, which exactly answers to the official drawings of spat in Sir J. E. Tennent’s work above quoted, and showed them to the retired Inspector of Ceylon Pearl Banks, Captain Steuart, in England, who, Captain Donnan informs me, repronounced them pearl oyster spat. Again, Captain Donnan, painstakingly anxious for truth, showed the challenged shells to Mr. Holdsworth, the Ceylon Government Naturalist;, who save them to his Government, who forwarded them to the Secretary of State, by whom tney were * This is a mistake. Sir J. B. Tennent was never on the banks, and never saw a fishery.—W. G. T.( 30 ) submitted to the same authority, Captain Steuart, who, strong in his twenty years’ experience, reaffirmed his former opinion that they were the spat of the pearl oyster. There the matter rested till I was deputed to Tuticorin, when Captain Phipps, with a tenacity indicative of the interest he had taken in his duties as Inspector of Pearl Fisheries, brought me on the 14th May some of the true spat just taken alive from the sea, together with the dead shells which he challenged, mentioned his contention, and invited my attention. ... 1 n . . „ . . .jr The challenged spat in the largest shell which I have seen is 4i-lbths of an inch from hmge t6 contour rectangularly at its widest point, and the largest drawing in Sir J. Emerson Tennent’s work is no more ; it is therefore so small as to need very close examination. Looked at under a hand- magnifying glass and under a low-power microscope, I made it out to dilfei from the shell of the pearl oyster in being much more convex, more oblique ; in having the ear on the sinal or short side not produced in an'almost straight line, but rounded off and turned up instead of being flat; in having the rmht valve fitting deeply into the left valve, with the edge of the right valve turned back at about an angle of 45 ° for the whole contour in some, for others only from the sinal ear to half way round the°contour—(and this deflection of the contour is much more expressed in some than in others) instead of the two valves meeting each other nearly flat as in the peral oyster—(in others, again there is no deflection at all) ; in having none of the spines with which the pearl oyster is covered, and distinctly different flanges ; in having no alpce adhering to it ; in having the umbones more anterior or advanced beyond the hinge line ; in adhering to weed, said to be Sargassum vulgare, instead of to rock and such-like hard substances ; in being differently coloured, the dark lines of colour radiating as in the drawing from the convexity to the contour. Again, it is only the concave part of the shell that is coated with glistening nacre, the broad deflected margin being dull. It is not so in the pearl oyster, in which the nacre comes close to the margin. In the aviculcB (‘ little bird ’) of which our pearl oy&amp;t&amp;v Avicula (Meleagrina) margaritifera is one, the prolonged hinge line straight at the hinge is brought in below with a curve that gives it a similitude to a wing of a bird, whence the name aviculce, and the sinal ear also, though shorter, is also slightly curved in below. In some aviculce this formation is more expressed than in others, so that they are divided into the two sections of the long-winged and short-winged aviculce. Avicula macroptera is the type of the former, and Avicula heteroptera and Avicula crocea, familiar forms with us, are illustrations of it; of the latter, Avicula {Meleagrina) margaritifera is the type, but still has the peculiarity distinctly present. In the challenged spat it is wholly absent. At the same time, however, that it is said in Reeve’s “Conchologia Iconica ” that this feature is always present in the aviculce, it is not shown in the small shell of T \ of an inch, Avicula vexillum, figured magnified in that work, which, as far as the drawing goes, has a general similitude to the challenged spat, and has against it the remark “ Habitat, Ceylon (in deep water), Gardner but beyond this the text description, though very brief, hardly tallies, and there are to my thinking three if not four forms among the challenged spat, all of which show under the microscope “the prismatic cellular structure of shell found in most of the aviculce^ (Carpenter). My belief is that they have been so long sailing under the false colours of being the pearl oyster spat that they are unnamed and seemingly mature aviculce, but I am not concerned to name them; all my contention for the purposes of this report is that they are not pearl oysters. But there is not only negative, there is also positive evidence, for Captain Phipps has produced the true spat of the pearl oyster, and I have seen them alive and have them preserved in spirits of progressive sizes from one-twelfth of an inch from hinge to contour rectangularly to half an inch, and after that the connecting progress is easy to trace, and the very smallest had all the characteristics of a pearl oyster of a year old from the prismatic cellular structure down to the spatulce, foliations, and algce on its shell. At that age also its flatness is in marked contrast to the convexity of the challenged spat. They were taken off an inexpensive temporary buoy made of a bit of bamboo tied by a rope to a stone, and put out not far from the Tholayiram Paar to show the divers that chankshad been come on. The buoy was put out on 17th or 18th March, 1884, and was taken up on the 14th May, so that at the very outside the spat cannot have been more than two months since falling, and may have been we know not how much less. The reason for the true spat having escaped observation so long, except Captain Phipp’s exact ing eyes, may readily be explained by the fact that they are almost flat and just the colour of the rock on which they lie, and very much more difficult to detect than the false spat. The acceptance of the false spat had also stopped inquiry by satisfying searchers in Ceylon. Only Captain Phipps was not satisfied.* I have asked Captain Phipps to be good enough to put out a few more such inexpensive buoys in the neighbourhood of oyster banks, and specially off the Tholayiram Paar, for we have very few of the true oyster spat as minute as ^ of an inch wherewith to prove our case. Captain Phipps has taken some with him to England after showing them in Ceylon, and I have retained a few in spirits. A few more specimens would be instructive to Museums ; and if these buoys were num bered and dated and examined once a fortnight, and fresh ones put out, if necessary, once a month, we could ascertain from them both the months when spat falls and the rate at which it grows, which I think will be found to be very rapid in the early stages of the oysters. But bamboos are liable to perforation by marine borers, when they sink and are lost. Metal should, therefore, be substituted. The matter will be referred to again in paragraph 89. No. i.~«. The Fall of Spat. The prime difficulty in connection with the oyster question in England appears to be the fall of spat. Our case is different, for after making all allowances for the false spat having been reported as the true, we have still ample evidence in the reports of young oysters having been found at an age when there could be no difficulty about their recognition, and this year the show of young oysters is enough to dispose of all doubt about the fall of spat. Our difficulty is rather the retention of the young oysters after they have been deposited. To give some idea of the numbers of young oysters now on the banks, I may mention that Captain Phipps, accompanied by Mr. Breeks-Atkinson, had * I was not satisfied. See my letter of 1868 referred to in report.—W. C. T.this year found the Tholayiram Paar covered with young oysters from end to end as thick as they could stand. The divers said they were a span deep or more, crowded one over the other. Captain Phipps estimated the extent at six square miles, and to give me an idea of the numbers on a given area he brought me a dead chank shell with the young oysters attached to it. I made out 80 young oysters on a shell measuring by 4^ in. If there are 80 oysters on 20^ square inches, there should, on six square miles, be some 95,158,272,000, say ninety-five thousand one hundred and fifty-eight million oysters on that one bank alone ; and as an equally favourable report is made of some eighteen other banks of less extent, there cannot be less than five hundred thousand million pearl oysters on our coast just now. Captain Donnan informed me that there was an equally good show of young oysters on the Ceylon coast this year. So that this year, at any rate, there is no difficulty about the fall of spat. The question rather is, How many of these young oysters will live to a fishable age ? To this we will come hereafter when examining the tabular statement. No. 1 .—B 2. False Spat. Again, there are grave suspicions ranging themselves round the term “ young oysters.” Are they really oysters, or are they the false spat (paragraphs 31-34 supra) which is a mature shell at that small size ? Looking at the frequent entries in 1865 and 1867, “ very young oysters and weed,” “ young oysters and weed,” it would seem that they are clusterers on weed (paragraph 31 supra), and seeing that on the second inspection in November of the same year they have disappeared, the idea is strengthened that they were mature shells of a minute species that have lived their life and passed away. Many such minute species have an ephemeral existence of not more than one year at the outside. On this subject the following entries in Statement C can be compared. In 1863, bank No. 50 ; in 1865, banks Nos. 7, 19, 20, 21 ; in 1866, bank No. 25 ; in 1867, banks Nos. 9, 12, 14, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26 ; in 1869, banks Nos. 1 and 3 ; in 1872, banks Nos. 20, 22, 23. If these so-called young oysters were never young oysters at all but short-lived aviculce of a small sort, then it is not at all surprising that they should disappear within a few months and be not found in the following year ; then the meaning of the statistics is, not that the pearl oysters have been always mysteriously disappearing, but that they were never present at all, and we must go through the statistics again for those of a size about which there could have been no mistake. Here I may be allowed to say that I am not blaming Captain Phipps for this. On the contrary, I have shown that he stood alone in challenging their being oysters ; but he was authoritatively over ruled, and having said his say he yielded to authority. Here I may also take occasion to remark that if the statistics show that we were without true spat in all these years, then they indicate that we should take measures to catch true spat and prevent its being all lost by being borne by the currents to areas where they cannot survive. That the very great and incalculable majority of the spat is thus lost, there can be no doubt. Witness the 80 shown above (paragraph 37) as clutching in desperation at one dead chank shell, when those that fell upon the shifting sand presumedly died. Still we are not certain that all these young oysters were false spat. From the following entries in Statement C, some at least of them seem to have been genuine oysters, for they remained to subsequent years and declared themselves when of an unmistakable size ; and so I have said above that we cannot be sure of the ground we are standing on, and the record must be more exactly kept before we can draw reliable conclusions from it. In 1877, on banks Nos, 13,14,15, and 16 the young oysters left dead shells the next year. No. 1.—€. The Enemies of the Oyster. Here, as elsewhere, I have endeavoured while reading and informing myself from former reports, as I do also from the native divers, not necessarily to follow them till I have tested for myself. No. 1—C 1. The Chank. Foremost among the enemies of the oyster is placed the chank ; and yet on personal trial I acquit him. On the contrary, I shall show that financially and otherwise he is the best friend of the pearl fishery. So satisfied, however, was Government that the chank fishery was injurious to the pearl banks that they ordered* * * § it to be discontinued ; and so decided was the eminent conchologist consulted by the Secretary of State, that he said they ought to be exterminated.! And yet I will take courage to advance as my opinion, that neither the fishing nor the lish does the oysters any manner of harm. I do so, not as presuming to prefer my own opinion to that of oldei students of conchology than myself, but because it is not always easy to trace in the writings of authorities which of their statements is based on their own personal observation of fact, which on acceptance of the opinions of previous inquirers; because the most eminent will, from love of truth, be the most ready to amplify or modify any partial acquisition of knowledge ; because, having been sent to the spot to collect facts from personal observation, I am bound by the terms of the Government order to record such for what they may be worth, rather than refer the Government to libraries which they already had ; also because, if I may be allowed the simile, because very tiny coral insects have thrown up extensive reefs and islands in the sea, and so I may be allowed, as I am bound, to throw out my little doubt. ^ x „ In paragraph 58 of their order No. 586, dated 21st March, 1884, the Government went so far as to desire that the then existing lease of the chank fishery should be redeemed and closed, and in the order under which I am now reporting the Government again revert to the piobability of the pearl fishery being injured by the operations of the chank divers disturbing the oysters. The same idea has been loosely held and advanced again and again at odd times, and to this day chank fishing is prohibited on the Ceylon coast for this same reason.* But the chank {TurUnella pyrum)\ * G-.

That broad fact T rln Tint W but I demur to its application in the sense of Turbmella pyrum m particular being intnrious^Q 1 pearl 3 oyster^^The native di vers held stoutly-and I deem rightly-that it is mnocuou^ to ovsters and feeds on worms ; while they admitted that there were other chanks-“ Kuthiramullu sLnku ’’ the spined horse chank, and “Anaimullu shanku,” the spined elephant chank wMch were destructive to oysters and Captain Phipps confirmed their words by saying that wherever elephant chank was found with its young there was a large clearance of oysters all around it m a circle and added that whenever they came across it they carefully destroyed it and all its young and that it was rare. The divers also supported their words by bringing me a horse chank which they had taken in the act of holding the Turbinella pyrum our fishery chank round ^e body with its tape-like tongue ; and they added, if it had not succeeded m surprising it out of its shell, it would have bored the shell at that spot, and they indicated PaQ labium or columdlar lip, ix., a point m the body whorl close to the aperture where there is no epidermis. Not a little surpnsed were these simple fishermen when I showed them through a microscope the numerous regular rows of glistening lancets with which the tip of its tongue is armed. But Turbmella pyrum had no such armoury at the end of its tongue ; at least I could discover none during the single and somewhat hurried oppor tunity allowed me for examination—an examination longer, however, than served to discover the armoury of the other tongue. I have made every possible endeavour to get other specimens to examine more leisurely and thoroughly, but in vain ; the monsoon prevented, and this report may not be delayed, and the verdict, an open one, is in favour of the accused only as far as it goes. lam aware that Try on speaks of the dentition of Turbinella pyrum the question is not whether it has teeth with which it can devour a worm, but teeth with which it can boin through a hard shel , just as it will be seen, under the next enemy of the oyster, that the question is as to the degiee of strength in the teeth of the trigger fish, whether it can break the shells of only very joung oysters and is incapable of breaking mature shells. ^ ^ „ In all fairness I am bound, to admit also that both. Captain Phipps and Captain JJonnan averred that they had seen a Turbinella pyrum eating an oyster. But to this I answer that the oyster before it reached the habitat of the Turbinella pyrum must have been choked with sand, dead and gaping, and the Turbinella pyrum, which has, as far as I can trace as yet, no means of boring the shell so as to destroy an oyster, was only eating one that was already dead. And to this agiees the remark in Tryon’s Conchology : “ Muller has seen Cerithia bored by JVLurex senegalensts, in con sequence of which the animal dies and opens its operculum when a Turbinella comes to share tbo feast ^ In my opinion, therefore, Turbinella pyrum may be acquitted of injuring the pearl oysters either in its fishery, which is conducted well away from the pearl banks, or in its carnivorous habits. On the contrary, the chank fishery, of which hereafter, yields a steady revenue from which the inspection of the pearl banks can be paid for, and maintains a class of divers by whom alone the pearl fishery can be conducted. In this respect even the pearl fisheries of Ceylon are in some measure dependent on our chank-diving population.^; No. 1—C 2. The Trigger Fish (“ Balistes ”). The trigger fish, so named from the trigger-like second ray of its first dorsal fin, and called also the file fish or leather jacket, from its rough exterior—Tamil “kilathi” ^eirirff^i —is said to be another enemy of the oyster. The fishermen say there are three of them in the Tuticorin seas. The one shown me was Balistes mitis. The fishermen say they eat mainly Suran, (^iresr (Modiola), and congregate wonderfully on the beds of the small mussels, and never attack any but the very young oysters; and to this agreed the teeth and the contents of the stomach of the one full-sized individual I was able to examine. The teeth, though sharp, were not strong, and were easily displaced by a penknife. The intestine contained chiefly shells of Modiola, and no oysters that I could detect, and no shells of any thickness. Doubtless they do eat young oysters on occasion, as do all rock fish, and Captains Phipps and Donnan have found shells of young oysters in them, but their favourite food is the Modiola, one of the worst enemies of the oyster ; so they themselves are more friends than foes to the oyster. No. l.-C 3. Rays or Skates. Rays are a very different class of enemy. Of the several sorts said to infest the oyster banks, the one sho wn me was Trygon warnak, which in Tamil is or ‘ slippery-skinned ray.’ The divers feared them as enemies of the oyster more than anything, and deprecated their visits with remarkable earnestness. The short thick teeth are exceedingly powerful, and capable of crushing a full-grown oyster. I saw the shells of Turbinella rapum chank that had been bitten right across the body whorl, where there was a thickness of solid shell of inch in some, in others of ^ 2 '^ 16ths of an inch, and that too disposed in the strongest form, that of an arch. The flatter shell of On the contrary, they informed me that they are injurious to the oysters.—W. C. T. i By an accident I have not been able to get these shells from Tuticorin in time to identify them ; but I think from memory that I am right in naming them Pyrula carnaria and Mur ex regius respectively. t -A- 8 I have reported, the chank fisheries of Ceylon and Tuticorin are the training grounds for divers. The Moham medan divers of Kilakarai of Southern India come to Ceylon and fish chanks north of Mannar island and round to the east coast as far as Mullaittivu. The Parava Tamil divers of Tuticorin fish the chanks near the Tuticorin banks for the Indian Government.—W. C. T.the oyster would yield much more readily. The fishermen informed me that rays are not always present on the banks, but come in by shoals from the deep sea with the south-west monsoon. They are also on the banks during the fishing, and the larger ones are sometimes mistaken for sharks and frighten the divers. I do not see that anything can be done to mitigate their destructiveness on the Iffttural banks ; but, looking at their discous forms and the inferior position of the mouth, it would seem that they can only feed off the bottom, and if artificial culture is ever attempted this should be taken into account. No. 1.—C 4. Suran (“ Modiola ”). The suran misspelt suram, sooram, and thooram, of which we hear so much as an enemy of the oyster, is a Modiola (a small measure or drinking vessel), and so like though smaller than Modiola barhata (Linn.) that it would seem to be a small form of it. Both Captain Phipps and the divers said that there were two forms of it on the pearl banks—I saw but one. There are however 70 existing and 150 fossil species of this genus of Mytilidce. The Modiolce are distinguished from the mussels by their habit of borrowing or spinning a nest, using stones, fragments of shells, and the byssal threads (Tryon’s Conchology), and this is the peculiarity with which we are practically concerned. Making by agglutination a regular blanket of triturated shells and sand, they seem to cover and smother the oyster with it. If they are found mixed with young oysters less than one year old, the destruction of the whole bed of oysters in this way is reported to be the invariable result. The divers also maintain that the life of the Modiola is four years, that of the oyster seven, and that the former dying earlier poisons the beds to the oysters by its putrefaction. But I am disinclined to attach weight to this view, because I do not trace in the reports of inspections any evidence of the oysters and the Modiola having existed together for four years. On the contrary, the destruction by smothering seems to be effected in a single year. Again, Captain Phipps’s experience is that if the young oysters only get a full year’s start free of Modiola, they are not afterwards liable to be injured by them ; and he surmises therefrom that it is because the young oysters are then old enough to eat the minute spat of the Modiola as it falls, and the divers say the same and are confident that it is not from Modiolas that the present clean beds of young oysters will suffer. I conceive Captain Phipps is right, and I see no practical way of dealing with this trouble beyond looking to the natural provision of the trigger fish (Balistes) -preferring Modiola to young oysters, and also when we can see our way to doing so with advantage, but not before, removing the young oysters to suitable beds free of Modiola. No. 1.—C 5, Currents. Omitting star fish {Asteriadce) and rock fish generally as not worthy of consideration in the open sea, and acquitting chanks {Turbinella pyrum) and trigger fish {Batistes) among the reputed enemies of the pearl oysters, rays and Modiola remain the only ones to which I have seen cause for attaching importance. But there is yet another power of nature which seems to me to be by far the most formidable of all, and seemingly the key of the secret why the Tuticorin banks have not yielded the same harvests as the Ceylon banks. I mean the currents. Mr. Holdsworth* drew attention to them as “ well worthy of continued observation” in Ceylon, but no systematic inquiry has followed there or in India. I find both Captain Phipps of Tuticorin and Captain Donnan of Colombo agreeing that a strong current sets with the rains in July from the north of the Bay of Bengal down the east coast of India and Ceylon, and hugging the coast turns north-westward from Colombo into the Gulf of Mannar and across it from the Ceylon to the Madras side. The direction of it does not seem to be exactly defined, but that after passing Colombo it is off the Ceylon coast is very clear from Captain Donnan having found himself borne so far off the Ceylon coast in the night that it took him hours—more than half a day I think he said—to regain sight of it (I speak here from memory, hot having it in my notes); and the conformation of the Madras coast would seem to indicate that its main force impinged a little north of Tuticorin. Mr. Holdsworth observed that its force on the Ceylon coast was such as to overpower the wind when there was “ a stiff breeze early in February ; and I too noticed that in Tuticorin roads on the 17th May, 1884, the British India steamer in which I was riding at anchor was by the force of the current laid broadside on to the wind, though it was blowing what sailors with me called “ hard. So strong is the current that ships cannot sail against it from Colombo to Galle. They have either to be towed against it by a steamer, or to put right out to sea to get out of its influence. Captain Phipps informed me that it increased in strength with the north-east monsoon in September, October, and November, and continued till * Extract Jrom Mr. IloldmortlCs Report. This is a subject on which I can obtain no evidence whatever from any one who is acquainted with or has made observations upon it. I am therefore entirely dependent on what has come within my own experience, and that during only a short time. There is some reason for so little being known on the subject During the south-west monsoon the coast in the neighbourhood of the banks is generally unapproachable. Whilst resident near Anppu last summer the wind was blowing half a gale, almost without a lull, for very nearly six months, and during that time not a vessel or fishing boat was visible from the land. It is difficult to suppose that such a long continuance of strong winds m one direction would not have produced some definite and regular movement of water. In the north-east monsoon the wind is very variable, but at times very strong, and might be expected to produce currents irregular in their direction and velocity, and partly dependent on the flow of water into and out of the gulf at its northern or southern extremities. The banks are only visited by the fishery officers when there are inspections or fisheries, and these only take place in March and November whilst the weather is fine and the sea tranquil between the monsoons. It is therefore unlikely that much experience would be gained at those times. This year, however, I was fortunate enough to get on the banks early in February, and for a week I was at anchor every night at the end of the Karativu shoal, between the Oheval and Modragam Paars. During the whole of this time_ a strong cunent was running to NN.E. in the face of continued north and north-east winds, so much so as to swing the vessel partly round against a stiff breeze. In March there was no current perceptible there ; but on one occasion, over another part of the banks there was a strong set to the south. It will be evident then that during the monsoons there may be currents over the banks' sufficiently strong to sweep away small oysters, or, on the other hand, to disperse them thXtTom bring them on the banks ; for such currents, as I have observed have not been merely at the surface but also a. the bottom as proved by direct experiment. The subject appears to me well worthy of continued observation ; for, although it may not be possible to control the currents, a knowledge of their direction and effects can haraly fail to be useful in looking foi oy&gt;te s and managing the banks. 80-02( 34 ) Christmas; aud that when the south-west commences about the 20th tebruary it sets more to the noHh and continues running north till July. The P. &amp; 0. steamer Kangoon was lost just outside Colombo* by the action of this current. That these strong currents affect not only the surface but also the bottom was first suggested to my mind by the weight of the chank shells, and by the power which I noticed they had of burying themselves in the sand with only the point of the sypho^ visible. It is also deducible from the fact that the divers complain of the bottom being at times so clouded with sand for the depth of a fathom that they cannot see, though from the surface till within a fathom of the bottom all is clear water. It was so at the close of May when I was there I hey also complained of a to and fro wash that carries them to and fro past any shells they wish to reach. This wave-like to and fro wash, which is very distinct from a steady current in one diiection, would seem to arise from the contending forces of the current and the tide in the cul-de-sac of the Gulf of Mannar. The gulf is practically a cul-de-sac, for the waterway in the Paumben channel is all too little to be taken into consideration. Again, we found from soundings taken that even at as much as 20 fathoms there were wave-like alternations in sand bottom to the depth of two fathoms, the soundings running suddenly from 20 to 22 and then from 22 to 20 fathoms, and again deepening and shallowing. The force that could throw up ridges of sand 12 feet high at a depth of 20 fathoms must be considerable, and it may well suffice to account for the disappearance of oysters coming within its influence. There seem to be no such ridges and troughs in the sandy bottom of the Ceylon side of the gulf; for Captain Donnan’s English divers reported the bottom to be a “ dead flat,” and Captain Donnan thought the more northern of the Ceylon banks, the only ones indeed on which any reliance has been placed, to be in a sheltered bight. But even on that coast he had found the divers occasionally complain of the to and fro wash, and had picked up four-year-old oysters dead and full of sand. Dr. Kelaart again writes of the Ceylon side, “ the divers report that there is scarcely any ground current on the banks.” Thus it would seem, as far as the information afforded me by observers and deducible from the sea bottom goes, that while the Ceylon coast of the Mannar Gulf is not altogether free of the current that sets from the mouths of the Hoogly round Galle and Colombo and thence turns north wards, it is mainly from the Ceylon side and towards ours that its course is, and that Ceylon has sheltered bights, while our banks are exposed. But the subject wants exactitude. Oysters doubtless thrive best in water as clear as crystal, when from the ship’s side one can see them at the bottom at the depth of six or eight fathoms ; for then they can be continuously feeding and growing rapidly. But they do not seem to die immediately from any little disturbance of the sand ; for the six miles of oysters found by Captain Phipps in March have been seen there doing well at the end of June, though at the end of May I crossed the bed and saw the whole sea rough and highly discoloured with sand from the premonitory gales of the south-west monsoon and a heavy current running. It seems rather a question of degree. Doubtless the pearl oysters can endure a good deal of sand, as witnessed by this survival—and if they could not they must have ceased to exist in that gulf—but the period is probably a period of enforced starvation with closed valves, as seemingly indicated above (paragraph 38) by the superior growth of the more sheltered Ceylon oysters. Fish will similarly endure long fasts, and cease growing the while, and where the fasts are habitual have a general stunted growth, and if well fed continuously grow proportionately and to such an extent as even to be classed as a separate genus. Not improbably therefore the pearl oyster is capable of enduring a period of rest, answering the purpose of hybernation in similarly facilitating its tiding over the period in which it cannot obtain food. We find every imaginable phase of it in animal and vegetable life, including the periods of sleep and hybernation in the human being, the bear, &amp;c., during which growth suffers no check, and the cold torpor and aestivation of fish during which they do suffer a check. There seems nothing extravagant therefore in the conjecture that the pearl oysters have a phase of this property, and that it may account for our oysters not keeping pace in rapidity of growth and in size with the more favourably situated Ceylon oysters. It is a question that might be solved by cultivation in cages, and is of interest in connection with artificial treatment and the advance of knowledge of the habits of the pearl oyster. Xo. 1.—D.

Now as ever chanks have been drawn into the discussion as the enemies of the oyster, but they have always lived side by side with them, and not only have the two fisheries been conducted by the same officer, and the chanks declared innocuous, but the chanks have actually been the support of the pearl fisheries both in the steady supply of funds and in the habituation and main tenance of a diving class, on whom the Ceylon pearl fisheries as well as our own are dependent for divers. It is well, therefore, that the chank fisheries should be both recognized as being as important as they are, and should be considered always in connection with the pearl fisheries. While the pearl fisheries of Tuticorin have yielded nothing to the State since 1862, and have in that time cost Government an outlay of Rs. 220,623, the chank fisheries have steadily yielded an income, very little certainly while under the renting system, but more since they have been under direct Government management, till they have reached Rs. 28,450, and might probably run up to Rs. 35,000 or Rs. 30,000 a year if the officer in charge of them is not liable to constant calling away (paragraph 92), has always his steamer at his command for towing (paragraph 92), and authority to hire a hulk and extend his fishery (next paragraph). Not only is it desirable in the interests of the Government pearl fisheries that the chank fisheries should be managed by its own officers, but a reference to the marginal statement will show how much more remunerative they have been under State management than under the leasing system. Under State management they can also be more intelligently worked with a view to permanency by saving the young instead of sacrificing them for a little temporary gain, and the enclosed statement (appendix G) will show that the price obtained by Government has not fallen, but increased with the increased number of chanks supplied by Government, so that the market would not seem to be satisfied. The Government has lately raised the rate of hire to the divers to This is not the case, Mr. Thomas must have been misinformed The P. &amp; O. steamer “ Rangoon” came to grief on rocks close to t^e entrance of Gralle Harbour (not Colombo) when leaving Galle.—W, C. T.Rs. 2 . Set. a hundred chanks, and it is not more than is necessary to induce the divers to work cheerfully, especially as they can now find more remunerative employment in other directions than they did formerly. The Government sells at an average rate of Rs. 90 a hundred, so that it is still interested in stimulating and aiding the divers to increase their takes. But the fatigue and loss of diving time in pulling many miles to sea against a head wind to get to their fishing ground sadly mnits their power and hours for diving. By using the steamer ‘‘Margaret Northcote” to tow a string of boats out to the diving grounds, the divers get out unfatigued and can undergo more diving ; they get out more quickly, and they start earlier and more punctually, for they take good care not to be left behind. The cost of thus towing is at the very outside Rs. 12 a day in coal, whereas the nett piofit on the extra number of chanks thus secured is about Rs. 100. Every day, therefore, that the steamer is taken aw*ay on other duty, as shown above (paragraph 92), is about Rs. 88 lost, and the total direct loss from all the absences in chanks alone might, by way of illustration of results if such absences are to be continued in future, be put at nearly half a lakh of rupees; and this is apart from the want of inspection of pearl banks. The boats, being towed out, have a favourable wind to sail back by and the steamer is free. Captain Phipps thinks, and I agi-ee with him, that if at certain seasons he could hire a vessel and take her out to the chank fishing grounds as a hulk in which the divers could pass the night and have their meals, he would be in a position to prevent their drinking to excess at nights, and would have them on the spot ready to begin fishing as soon as the sun was sufficiently high to enable them to. see at the bottom, and the additional number of chanks taken would a great deal more than pay for the cost of the hulk and the cost of giving the divers their food and regulated dram free as a sort of batta. The experiment has been tried at an island that lent itself to the trial, and was found to work very advantageously. The best chank grounds are off a village in which spirits are very cheap, and if the divers are nightly landed there the disadvantage to the fishery is great. The Superintendent should be free to incur the expense ; it will be more than amply repaid to Government. It will also be true kindness to the divers, which they will fully recognize as erst, and there will be no difficulty about their joining such an expedition. The chanks paid for are only those that are too large to go through a certain hole in a board. The others are divided into three classes : those that drop through the hole freely, and those that are “tight,” as it is termed, or only pass through with difficulty, and those that are worm-eaten. The “ tight ” chanks are retained for Government without being paid for ; the smaller ones are returned to the sea the next day. Retaining the “ tight ” chanks for Government without payment is a piece of nearness fruitful of heart-burnings to the divers. It is a cause of constant haggling, and it should be abandoned. There should be a simple straightforward rule that if Government retains a shell it will pay for it ; and if it declines to pay for it, it should treat it like other shells declared too small to take, and return it to the sea. I was present at one day’s tallying of the chanks taken : there were 1,499 paid for as good, 104 to be returned to the sea as too small, 215 retained by Government with out payment as “ tightand I was quite ashamed to be a spectator to what seemed to me a piece of sharp practice on the part of Government. Government should treat these child-like men as a father honourably, and they will appreciate it. Twenty-six more were retained by Government unpaid for as worm-eaten. They are few and not worth considering. They are probably unhealthy with a weekly epidermis, or I would say they too had better be returned to the sea to breed ; they are probably better out of it. The small ones refused, and put aside to be returned to the sea when the divers went out the next day, were, I found, ordinarily kept in a basket without water. I determined to see how they fared under that treatment and took some home with me. Of those I took I kept two-thirds all night and till 8 the next morning just as they were in the basket in which they would be kept—just, in fact, as the divers would keep them till they returned them to the sea—and then I returned them to the sea in a place where I could wade in and stand close over them and watch the result on them. I watched them for two days. Of the eleven thus put out, two had disappeared on the second day and presumedly survived, having walked away or buried themselves. Of the remaining nine, all were dead but two, and those were dying. Thus it w~as clearly shown that the small chanks kept in a dry basket to be returned to the sea the next day as a rule were sure to die, and might just as well not be returned at all if they were kept in that fashion. At the same time there was the further question whether the exposure to the sun they had already suffered from the hour of their capture to the hour of their tallying at the yard was in itself enough to kill them, so I put five in a bucket of sea water directly I got home, and kept them the same time as the others and turned them into the sea at the same time. They were all strong and well and walked away vigorously, exhibiting their manner of walking always siphon foremost and siphon raised, and of burying themselves sometimes with only the point of the siphon above the sand so as to allow of respiration. This showed that if directly the tallying was over those chanks refused as too small and reserved for return to the sea, instead of being kept in a dry basket, were immediately put in buckets of water, or, better still, into rough strong bag nets sunk near the shore with a stone, and towed overboard the next day, every one would be returned to the fishing grounds alive ; and when I add that the number sacrificed in the current year up to the date of my inspection for want of this little simple attention was, including “tight” ones 25,000, it will be seen that a very appreciable difference to the breeders could be made if they were returned alive instead of dead. They should not be returned anywhere, for instance, on white sand or on mud, but on ground suited for chanks, which of course would be the ground on which the divers find natural chanks the next day. Returned dead they only form homes for hermit crabs. Though the animal cannot be seen, the shell thus inhabited can be detected at once by its travelling side foremost, instead of siphon foremost and siphon raised as the live chank does. The divers are also quick at running the trail of a travelling chank by following up its furrow. I measured one If inch broad. They also detect the burrowed ones by the whiteness of the sand thrown up in burrowing. Though it makes a furrow in the sand when travelling, the chank can also walk over a rock or a human foot. It does not affect muddy bottom or white sand, but the sand which breeds worms. They call it puchimanal in Tamil. It ordinarily segregates in search of food, and in May it buries itself, and in December it congregates for breeding, and each female sheds its eggs in a separate spiral tough gellatinous or gristly purse, which is anchored to the sand by the thin end of a finelytapered funnel, rvhich stands upright and s thus ^ divided into a number of telescopic storeys wh ch expand bj ‘en | out .

Ceylon has no chank fisheries,* though the divers informed me that the Ceylon coast breeds chanks in rare abundance and size. This may be in some measure the result of their not having been thinned by fishing. At any rate, it is an argument that chanks are not in themselves injurious to pearl fisheries, as they co-exist with pearl oysters in larger numbers than with us and yet the fisheries are more profitable. The objection to a fishery for chanks has been, I understand, idea that it would disturb the oyster banks. But I think I have met that difficulty above (paragraph 45) I am so indebted to the Cevlon authorities, and to Captain Donnan m particular, for open unreticen kindness in giving me any information sought, that I venture, at the risk of being thought presump tuous, to mention, with thanks for courtesies received, that they could probably make a steady annual revenue of from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 from chank fisheries, if they thought fit to consider the suggestion : or, if thev so preferred it, this Government might with advantage pay Ceylon a royalty for the liberty to work her chanks with ours. A hulk with a crew of divers, as m paragraph 98, might he sent over once a year for a fortnight’s or month s fishing trip m stated localities, and the chanks brought away in strong brine to prevent their being offensive on board. In our chank storeroom they are left to be cleaned by the maggots of the blow fly, and the effluvium is unendurable. Our fisheries could also be extended seemingly along the Madura and Panjore coasts (G. O. dated 4th December, 1883, No. 1,513), and the Ramnad Zemindari rights to fish beyond Admiralty limits, or in the sea at all, must be questionable. In submitting the above report, I have introduced the correct Tamil nomenclature, because I think it may be an assistance to future inquirers in facilitating their communications with the fisherfolk. in the same way as correct scientific nomenclature refers the student to his books. Dr. Kelaart’s reports have not lost their value. They were obtained from Ceylon by Government, and obtained late. As there was such difficulty therefore in getting them, and they were so valuable, I thought it well to preserve them convenient for reference as an appendix to this report, and not till after I had so printed them did I discover that they had been previously reprinted m G. O. dated 17th February, 1864, No. 288, Revenue. I repaired to Tuticorin as soon after getting my orders as possible, and even before the receipt of certain papers necessary to the inquiry, Dr. Kelaart’s among them ; and I stayed there till the monsoon made further stay useless, and yet I got in all only ten days, exclusive of Sunday, at the fishery. If, therefore, I have not been able to solve all riddles in connection with the pearl fisheries, I trust the Government will be satisfied that I made the best use in my power of my time and opportunities for at least advancing the inquiry somewhat, and placing the perplexities m a better way, I hope, for fuller solution hereafter. I trust the Government will also recognize the difficult nature of the inquiry, in illustration of which I would solicit their attention to the following remark of Mr. W. Anderson Smith in his paper on the Yarions Methods of Oyster Culture printed in “ Fish and Fisheries, 1883,” as a prize essay of the International Fisheries Exhibition, Edinburgh, 1882 : “There still remains very great ignorance on the subject that must be cleared up ere we can properly understand the continued failure of spat in our seas These and other questions remain to be answered before we can have any certainty in the breeding of oysters in the north.” So great an authority as Professor Huxley also, after delivering himself of a paper that is, of course, most learned and brings all the learning of Europe and America to a focus, ends his paper in the English Illus trated Magazine, with the following open acknowledgment of the world’s partial knowledge :—“ I f° r my part believe that the only hope for the oyster consumer lies first in oyster culture and secondly in discovering a means of breeding oysters under such conditions that the spat shall be safely deposited ; and I have no doubt that when those who undertake the business are provided with a proper knowledge of the conditions under which they have to work, both these objects will he attained.” If Professor Huxley himself could write thus after nearly forty years of scientific interest in the oyster, and with all the knowledge of all the scientists of Europe and America at his command, it will hardly be expected that I should read the whole riddle in ten days, especially when, as I have * This is a mistake. There is a ehank fishery north of Mannar island.—W. C. T.( 37 ) pointed out, there are idiosyncrasies in the pearl oyster which must be studied for themselves, and in connection with which European knowledge of the edible oyster sheds no aiding ray, but must rather be compared with caution as possibly leading to error by its inapplicability. \u. 1.—E. Age of the Pearl Oyster. The age of the pearl oyster is, as Mr. Holdswortk says,* a matter of some practical importance. It is held that they live for seven years and die ; consequently the fishery must be conducted before they die, or the pearls will have dropped out with the dead decaying animal. It is also held that the pearls are too small to be worth taking till the fish is more than four years old, so that when a Superintendent of Pearl Fisheries comes on a bank of oysters he has to determine their age, and therefrom to decide when it will be remunerative to fish the bank, and to advertise the fishery and make all his arrangements for temporary buildings, guards, &amp;e., well in advance. If he fishes them a year too late, he may lose them all; if a year too soon, he may get but a poor price for the pearls, for the buyers regulate their bids by tested samples. The ageing of the oyster had been originally taken entirely from the experience of the natives, though latterly it has been tested by the annual inspections of European officers, who note the difference in the shells from what they were at the previous year’s inspection. But it has been seen that both alike have made a wrong start in what is not a pearl oyster, but seemingly small unnamed aviculce. I also came to the conclusion from conversations held with the divers that they have been misunderstood. They use the word “ oru vaiyas” in the sense of under one year old, not as it is ordinarily translated one year old, which with Englishmen means over one but not yet turned two years old, and thus a whole year has been added to their estimate. So far I think that their estimate is right in putting the growth of the oyster as a year more rapid in its earlier stages than is generally thought ; and this accounts for the officers not unfrequently coming on well-grown oysters, which they seem blameworthy for not having discovered earlier. And the rapidity of the growth seems to turn with oysters also, as we know it does with fish, on the favourableness of the surroundings. Thus we know that out of the same hatching of salmon some will descend to the sea a whole year later than their twin brethren. * Extract from lieport by Mr. Holdsworth. It will be evident from what has been said that an accurate knowledge of the age of any oysters on the banks is a matter of the first importance, in order that the fishery for them may take place when they are likely to be the most valuable. I have frequent opportunities of obtaining the opinions of the native divers, and the various classes of persons who take part in the inspection of banks, about the age of such oysters as were found ; and although I am unwilling to say there is no one connected with the fisheries who can give a trustworthy opinion about the age of an oyster, I must distinctly state that, among the variety of opinions I have heard, I am unable to say I have reason to believe one rather than another. The natives are supposed to be better acquainted with everything relating to the pearl oyster than Europeans, who have only had few opportunities of visiting the banks. Such should especially be the case with those natives who have had a long experience of fisheries and inspections. Yet instances might be given to show that traditional ideas still hold their ground against the teachings of experience and reason. The opportunity of applying to any of the more experienced natives a direct test of their knowledge of the age of oysters has not occurred to me until very lately ; and as I am anxious to place clearly before His Excellency the G-overnor the amount of knowledge possessed by those whose opinions may have some weight with those in authority, I will relate what took place. In March, 1886, a large iron buoy, new from the Factory, perfectly clean and fresh painted, was laid down at my request as a permanent mark on the Karaitivu shoal. This buoy was taken up last month (March, 1867) to be cleaned and repainted. It had then been in the water exactly one year, and its under surface was thickly covered with large barnacles, mussels, and a few pearl oysters. These oysters were carefully preserved for two or three days, and I then requested the Superintendent to obtain the opinion of the most experienced and trustworthy diver as to their age. A diver long known for his skill and intelligence was called, and three of the largest oysters placed before him without his knowing where they were found. He at once pronounced two of them to be two years old, and the third a year and a half. If the opinion of the diver be correct, there is only one way of accounting for the presence of these oysters on the buoy ; they must have worked their way up an almost perpendicular chain for a distance ot more than twenty feet, and this must have been accomplished after two of them were a year old, a feat I consider to be in the highest degree improbable, and one requiring such an enormous secretion of byssus material as I believe would be entirely beyond the powers of such oysters. If there had been a bed of oysters below the buoy, and oysters or their cast-off byssus were found adhering to different parts of the chain, there might be some reason for believing in their travelling upwards to the buoy ; but nothing of the kind existed. The ground below is entirely fine white sand on which no oyster has ever been discovered, and the mooring chain and anchor were perfectly clean and free from extraneous growth, except within five or six feet from the buoy. That part of the chain was covered with barnacles like those on the buoy immediately above, but after a close examination of the whole buoy, chain, and anchor, I could find no trace of oysters except on that part of the buoy just below the line of flotation. , . , , „ . . It must be remembered that in their very early state pearl oysters, mussels, and barnacles are all free-swimmmg animals, keeping at or near the surface of the water. After a short period barnacles fix themselves permanently, and in general to some floating body. Mussels and pearl oysters, on the contrary, sink to the bottom ; but mussels are continually found adhering to the bottoms of ships, proving that the change from freedom to fixity often takes place near the surface, if any suitable situation be found for adhesion. Pearl oysters are too closely allied to mussels to permit oue to anticipate much difference in their habits, and if oysters had never before been found adhering to floating bodies analogy would teach Much has been said about the discovery by the late Dr. Kelaart that the pearl oyster had the power of locomotion by the formation of a new byssus and the casting off of the old one. All molluscs which possess a byssus or fibrous^ appendage for moorins' themselves to any fixed object (this is undoubtedly the primary function of the byssus) have, so far as it is known, the riower of casting off their cable, and moving in any desired direction by means of new threads thrown out m advance of the old ones by a peculiar organ called the “ foot.” Dr. Kelaart very properly mentioned that this power of locomotion might have been reasonably expected in the pearl oyster, as it is found in the mussel so closely allied to it. It must not be supposed, however, that oysters have the power of rapid movement, or that they have cut the cables and voluntarily removed from the banks They warp themselves along precisely as a vessel does, and the process must necessarily be slow and exhausting, as new cables must be produced for every step that is made. The difficulties then in ascending a considerable length of chain must be obvious, even if any intelligible reason could be given for the oysters leaving their natural habitat, the ground, and mounting a long distance in order to arrive at the surface. „ . , ,, . p ■, I have now pointed out what I think should be considered m dealing with the question of the age of the oyster found on the buoy, and I have no hesitation in stating my conclusion on the subject, viz., that these oysters took up their position on the buoy at the earliest stage of their growth, and that they were not more than one year old when, a few weeks ago, they were discovered. This case, although apparently trifling, teaches two lessons of considerable importance, viz. (1) That the opinions of the natives, which have been so much looked up to, are not trustworthy. (2) That pearl oysters attain a much larger size during their first year than has been supposed. A parallel case to this has occurred within the last few days. One of the buoys in the Colombo harbour has just been taken up after being in the water one year, and two pearl oysters of the size commonly supposed to be attained m two years were found attached to its under surface. The two cases are alike m every respect, except that m Colombo harbour the ground is mud instead of sand. They will both bear the same interpretation.

It is not unnatural that oysters should follow the same rule. Accordingly, we find in clusters of oysters considerable variation m size, and yet hardly enough to say they belonged to different spattings—though it was contended before me by the divers that of the oysters this year found on the Tholayiram Paar (bank No 30) some were one year some a year and a half, some two years old. They had doubts, however, m their own minds. Seeing that all tb# oysters in one bed or cluster would seem to be under more or less approximately similar conditions, one would not expect to find the variations in growth very great; but when the circumstances are altogether different, as in the case instanced by Mr. Holdsworth in the margin, one naturally expects to find a very marked difference in the health and growth of the animal; and instead of concluding with him that that case is evidence that the divers know' nothing about the rate of growth. I would rather conclude that under normal conditions they had a 7 ® r y ia11 ’ P o y er of estimating from experience ; and that applying normal rules they declared and declared rightly that the particular oyster was as large as an ordinary two-year-old oyster ; and that the want of agreement arose not out of their ignorance of normal growth, but from the abnormal growth of the abnormally placed oyster In this connection I may mention that similarly I find Captain Phipps and Captain Donnan, both experienced Superintendents of Pearl Fisheries, with a keen interest in their duties differing markedly in their ageing of the oysters, though both inspect from year to year and watch growth. I also find Captain Donnan producing shells much larger than any to be found on our coasts, both indications not that either Captain Phipps or Captain Donnan is in error, but that the circumstances of the Ceylon banks are more congenial to rapid and finer growth than are those of the Madras banks • and I shall hope to explain this below in connection with currents (paragraph 54) and clean water (paragraph 81). Again, Mr. Holdsworth doubts “if any intelligible reason could be given foi the oysters leaving their natural habitat, the ground, and mounting a long distance in order to arrive at the surface.” To my thinking the answer is given by the animal itself in its abnormal growth, and is in keeping with what has been seen above (paragraphs 13 and 16) of the oyster s impulse to get to the surface, or, to put it more correctly, to get away from the sand, for there was a little percep tible in the water, which had been taken from near shore ; in keeping also with the inverse position in ’which we find whole banks choked and killed with sand. Normally we find that the pearl oysters climb to the top of every bit of dead coral or shell to get as far as possible off the sand ; further they cannot go, and therefore only do they stop at the bottom. If they could—if we could arrange that they could—all get a clean three fathoms off the sand, I have no doubt that we should have no losses from sand choking. While I concur then with Mr. Holdsworth in thinking his oysters came to the buoy as spat and grew there, I differ from him in thinking that their growth there is any test of normal growth. On the contrary, what I would conclude from his experiment is that if we are ever to rear pearl oysters artificially, it should not be at the bottom of the sea, but in the more favourable position of being well free of the sand. But of that hereafter. In the meantime the more practical question is, How are we to know their normal rate of growth ? Certainly not from aquaria, for that would be only to test by abnormal conditions again—conditions almost always found to be unfavour able, for few, if any, fish grow in an aquarium as fast as they do in their normal condition ; with many also experiences are singularly unfavourable. To know the normal rate of growth we can only watch them in their normal positions, and record more systematically than heretofore. To expedite their growth artificially is another matter of which, as I have said, hereafter. \o. 1 .—F. Summary of Suggestions. In conclusion, it may be convenient to Government, as well as easily indicative to the fishery officer, that I should sum up as briefly as possible the several suggestions which I submit for their consideration and his assistance, together with a reference to the paragraphs in which they are to be found :— I. —Inspections should be more frequent—paragraph 80.

I would prefer meshed^cylinders 1 ft. 10 m m diameter, 9 ft. long, buoyed at one end, anchored at the other, so that they should stand more or less upright in the water, so as to give an opportunity of noting ff ie P re f er ® nces °f tile o y s f er a s to depth ; and I would have one below another, the lowest being three fathoms off the bottom, the highest within half a fathom of the surface ; and as the pearl oveter adheres by its byssus a coating of cement over the tar will be preferable. And then I would surround the upper cage with spat-catchers at a little distance off, composed of coir matting or galvanized iron or tin tubes coated with cement (paragraph 36). If these tubes of, say, an inch in diameter were made to fit into the centre of the cages, then young spat could be readily caged and kept till ready to put out on natural banks, and a proportion kept for observation and breeding from. Tke one-inch tubes being airtight would float and catch the drifting spat. Arranged in a square or triangle one mre would suffice to anchor three or four to a stone. Dr. Kelaart also proposed spat-catchers and Mr. Holdswoi th disapproved, because Dr. Ivelaart would have used them on a much larger scale than I propose—a scale that I think was impracticable. A few spat-catchers might also be°dotted about round such of the banks as small as a room as are left for breeding. But this will be of no use till we have ascertained the banks on which oysters will stay. We have now several well-stocked banks, and if on any of these we find the oysters stay those should be selected for artificially restocking as soon as they have thoroughly sweetened after a fishery. Dr. Kelaart proposed that one-fortieth of every fished bank should be left for breeding purposes ; but I think that a fishery so disturbs the bottom, leaves so many dead putrefying oysters and attracts so many predatory fish, that the proportion left will be left unfavourably positioned, and I would prefer the above proposals. Appendix No. 2. \o. 2 .—A. Letter to Mr. Twynam from Capt. Donnan, regarding Age of Oysters. Colombo, August 29, 1876. My DEAR TWYNAM, — I HAVE been trying to find out from official records the age of oysters at different fisheries during the last series from 1855 to 1863. I cannot trace the oyters of all the fisheries from their first stage, but there is reliable data for fixing the age of oysters fished in 1855, 1859 on Modragam, 1860, and 1863, and I make all out to have been under five years old at the time of fishery. I have made a memorandum of my investigations, and enclosed is a copy of it. I shall keep Steuart’s book and return you when we meet at the October inspection. I find his drawings of oysters do not tally with my samples. I have a printed copy of his book without the drawings, so that it would not be worth while going to the trouble of copying out the manuscript. Did yon. mean me to get three copies of the whole book made cut, or only copies of the drawings ? I hope you are all well and jolly. Yours sincerely, JAMES DONNAN.( 40 ) Enclosure. Memorandum on the Series of Pearl Fisheries from 1855 to 1863. Fishery of 1855 on South-West Gheval. The oysters forming this fishery were first discovered in November, 1851, when the report d? inspection states that “two extensive heels of oysters of full one year old in a healthy state were found on the west and south-west towards the outermost verge of the productive fishing ground of Oantain Steuart’s time in from 61 ,to 8 fathoms water, holding out considerable promise of future fisheSes” These oyslers we“ inspected again in March, 1853, when the report states “ a bed of oysters of four or five years old, of about two miles in length by one mile m breadth, was found on the outer margin of Oheval Paar, holding out expectation of a fishery in 1800. , ,, They were inspected again in March, 1854, when the report states “ the oysters on the south west margin of the Oheval Paar were found in a healthy condition, affording every prospect of a successful fishery, but they were scattered over a large space and not P‘ en “ tul - They were inspected again in November, IS.il, and a sample of 4,000 hft-d. J hej were fashed in March 183^ We may take the first estimate of the age of these oysters as the most correct, because the age of oysters can be more accurately estimated up to the first year than afterwards and supposing they were in November, 1853, one year old, this would make their age at time ot fishing four 3 -ears and four months. Fishery of 1851 on North-West Gheval. I can find no trace of the early history of these oysters. The report of inspection of March, 1854 states : “ On the western side of the oysters on south-west Cheval extending into nine fathoms younger oysters of from one and a half to two and a half years were found, but the fishing ground of 1857 is to the northward and not to the westward of the south-west Cheval.” The report of the inspection of November, 1854, states that the south-west Cheval oysters were scattered over many detached spaces, the northernmost of which adjoined oysters of about four yeais, and this is the first trace I can find of the 1857 oysters, but Captain Steuart’s four-year-old oysters are only of the size of my two-year-old, and I doubt if these oysters were more than two years at that time.” The report of inspection of March, 1856, states “that the northern part of the Cheval was inspected and the oysters were found remaining as last year, and in the opinion of the Adapannars five and a half years old.” They were inspected again in November, 1856, and a sample of 10,000 lifted. 1 hey were fished in March, 1857. Fishery of 1858 on North-West Gheval. The bed of oysters fished in this year adjoined on the north-west side the bed fished in 1857, and the oysters are supposed to have been of the same brood. Fishery of 1859 on North-West Gheval. The oysters of this fishery were the remnant of those unfished in 1858. Many dead shells were found when they were inspected in November, 1857, and it was then thought doubtful if thej would survive to be fished. So for as I can make out the oysters fished on north-west Cheval in 1857, 3858, and 1859 were of the same brood originally, and it is a pity that there is no record of their first appearance on the bank. It would seem from the records of the 1857 fishery that the oysters were too young for fishing; those of the 3858 fishery were about the right age for fishing; and those of 1859 might be called too old, as it was a mere chance that any remained alive for fishing. Fishery of 1859 on Modragam. These oysters were first discovered in March, 1856, when they were found on the west side of the Modragam in great abundance in large clusters, and were from the size of a shilling to that of a crown piece. They were inspected again in November, 1856, and were then reported to be in great abundance, and the chief part of them estimated at full four years old. They were inspected again in March, 1857, and found in abundance in large clusters and estimated at three to five years old. Sample of 12,000 lifted in November, 1858. Fished in March, 1859. Oysters of the size of a crown piece are only about one year old, and of the size of a shilling about six months ; therefore the age of these oysters when first seen in March, 1856, was from six to twelve months. The rapid increase in the size of oysters between the first and second year of their age is sufficient to account for these same oysters being estimated in November, 1856, at four-year, especially as the Inspector then (Captain Higgs) was new to the work and had not had an oppor tunity of watching oysters every year from their youth up to maturity. I have no hesitation whatever in fixing the age of these oysters in March, 1856, when first discovered, at about one year; it therefore follows that when they were fished in March, 1859, they were only about four years old. Fishery of 1860 on Modragam. Two portions of this bank were fished in this year, the northern part and south-east part The oysters on the northern part were the remnant of the fishing of 1859, consequently they were about five years old when fished. The oysters on the south-east portion of the bank were younger, and may therefore be said to have been about four years old when fished. Fishery of 1868 on South-East Gheval. The oysters of this fishery were first discovered in November, 1858, when it was stated that oysters of six months were found in abundance all over the Cheval. They were seen again during the fishery of 1859, and were then said to be one and two years old. They were next seen in November, 1860, and were then estimated at three years. They were next examined in November, 1861, and were then estimated at five years, and a sample of 5,000 lifted. They were fished in March, 1863. Age at time of fishing, according to first estimate, under five years.liH 6 report (f s ^te ^ mui ! °ff % 9 ay,» at ine groin! eportoftln l over miT ted aid i i and a M for! 0 ur years ( 41 ) Fishery which failed in 1864 on Smith- West Cheval. These oysters were of the same brood as those fished in 1863, and were found all dead when examined m February, 1864. They ought to have been fished the previous year, and they would have been fished then if circumstances had permitted The fishery of 1863 was carried on as lon^ as possible, and was only closed when the south-west monsoon set in. Fishery of 1855 : age of oysters four years and four months. Fishery of 1857 : age of oysters doubtful, probably four years. Fishery of 1858 : age of oysters doubtful, probably five years. Fishery of 1859 on Cheval : age of oysters doubtful, probably six years. Fishery of 1859 on Modragam : age of oysters doubtful, probably four years. Fishery of 1860 : age of oysters four and five years. Fishery of 1863 : age of oysters under five years. It would appear from the above that oysters may be profitably fished at the age of four years ; and that they are in their prime at five years, and may be kept till that age if circumstances will permit of it; but if they are kept till the sixth year they are almost certain to be found dead. After examination of the drawings of oysters of various ages in Steuart’s manuscript book on the Pearl Oyster, and comparison with my samples lifted yearly from the earliest stage up to time of fishing, I find that Steuart’s twelve or fourteen months’ oysters equal mine of six months; Steuart’s two years old oysters equal mine of one year ; Steuart’s four years old oysters equal mine of two years ; Steuart’s between five and six years old oysters equal mine of three years. I have no sample equal to his drawing of oysters between six and seven years old. My five- year-old oysters are something similar to them in breadth, but not so elongated. I should say that what I call four-year-old oysters Steuart would have called six years. Mr. Dyke records in his diary of the fishery of 1855 that the oysters then being fished from south-west Cheval produced a larger proportion of very large pearls to small ones than is usually the case with oysters from other beds, and that this is admitted to be a distinctive character of this bed. A similar distinctive character was observed in the oysters fished from the west or north-west Cheval in 1874. No. 2—a. [Extract from Captain Steuart’s “ Account.”] Notes taken at Kondatchy on Tuesday, the 15th March, 1831, on an inquiry made by order of the Commissioner of Revenue, of several respectable natives respecting the indications which mark the age of pearl oysters. Comarasamy Modeliar, Interpreter to the Fishery, states as follows :—“ I generally form my opinion from the size and appearance of the shells. When the oysters are too young to be produc tive of pearl, the edges of the shells are soft, but as they approach maturity the shells become harder and the soft rim is worn away. The hinges of the shells become thicker and the groove or space at the back of the hinge, which admits of the oyster opening its shells, becomes wider and deeper as the fish becomes older. “ Pearls may sometimes be found in oysters between three and four years old. But oysters should not be fished before the sixth year of their age is completed, and the nearer the end of the seventh year the better, if they continue healthy. After six years they are liable to die off suddenly. Oysters may have lived for nine years, but it is generally admitted that they seldom exceed seven. “ An opinion may be formed of the age of oysters both by the quantity and quality of pearl which they yielded. The pearls found in young oysters are very small and of a pale white colour which improves in richness and brilliancy as the age increases up to the seventh year, after which, if the oysters do not die, the pearls begin to lose their beauty of colour. “ Oysters adhere firmly in clusters to each other or to rocks on the banks until they are five years old. The diver sometimes find it difficult to separate them from the rocks. After the fifth year they fall off from the rocks and become scattered, and are more easily collected by the divers.” Mannar Adapanaar states :—“ The colour of the shells changes with the age of the oysters, and the edges of the shells are worn away and become harder, the score at the back of the hinge becomes wider, the shells are increased in thickness, and soon after five years the upper part of the upper shell commences to be worm-eaten. The age of the oysters is readily ascertained by the appearance of the shells. “ Pearls are found in oysters of four and a half years of age, not earlier. The time to fish is soon after the sixth year, because after that period they may die off quickly.” Cheninina Chetty, merchant, confirms the above in most particulars ; he however places no dependence in the colour of the shells, and prefers conclusions drawn from the quantity and quality of pearl which the oysters produce. Young oysters have pearls sometimes of a yellow tinge. Old oysters have pearls sometimes of a pink tinge. Large pearls are never found in young oysters. Cader Saib, merchant, has attended eight or nine fisheries, and considers there is no difference in the colour of pearls produced in old and in young oysters taken from the same bank. Manuel Pulle has attended every fishery since 1814. He confirms the opinion of the Adapanaar, and states that the shells of young oysters are of a reddish colour. 80-02( a ) Appendix No. 3. [Extract from Captain Steuart’s Account of the Pearl Fishery, page 82.] I subsequently suggested that if a Naval Officer should be appointed Superintendent of Pearl Fisheries, he should not permanently reside at Arippu, but be placed in command of a good vesse^ capable of carrying five or six boats with crew and divers, as ships fitted tor the whale fishery carry their boats and crew, in order that pearl banks might be searched for on all parts of e coas o Ceylon. No. 3.-A. [Extract from the Fishery Inspection Report of Mr. Gr. Vane in November, 1861.] At page 10 of diary I have noticed the unwieldy, unmanageable character of the native boats, how unfitted and inefficient they are for inspection work, how much time is lost from their inability to work except in the calmest weather, and even then most heavily and slowly ; with any breeze they drift to leeward and cannot be pulled or kept in the desired position. Then, the system of daily going to and coming from shore is the cause of much delay, frequently the loss of days work ; all this retards and interferes with the efficiency of the steamer and causes unnecessary delay and expense. On this last occasion, out of five working days two and a half were lost from its being impossible to pull these heavy boats ; and as the headmen’s services are now dispensed with, I pro pose the purchase of four English boats, i.e., cutters of four or six oars to be used with the steamer s two large boats for inspection and fishery work. Such a class of boats could be easily and efficiently managed, and a saving of expenditure would ultimately result, as the hire of the six native boats and crews now costs at inspections £3. 15s. 6 rf., at fisheries £4. 19s. per day, and these rates are being constantly increased, and besides there is the additional cost of coming from and returning to Jaffna ; whereas crews of 24 to 30 men would be sufficient for the boats I propose, and these could be engaged at Colombo for Is. 6d. to 2s. each per day, and being with the boats attached to the steamer they would always be ready early and late, whenever required for work. I have consulted Captain Donuan upon the suggestion, and he considers the use of such boats most advisable and necessary. Should my proposition be sanctioned, the boats may be obtained from ships at this port or perhaps better at Bombay by Captain Donnan ; their cost would be from £100 to £120. Buoys. Some twenty small light iron buoys with small grapnels are needed, instead of the cumbrous wooden ones now used by the headmen. Their anchors are unnecessarily large and must destroy numbers of oysters, and with the buoys are unwieldy and often difficult to lay down and pick up. The iron buoys can be made at the Factory and the grapnels purchased at the market. The cost of providing boats and buoys may be defrayed out of the vote for inspection and fishery purposes. No. 3.—B 1. [Extract from Inspection Diary of March, 1862.] Colombo, March 24, 1862. I have enjoined Mr. Worsley to a most efficient guard over the Cheval and Modragam, and directed this watch to be kept until the bad weather of the breaking of the monsoon really sets in, not however to run any risk with the present boat, which is not equal to the service. I trust the new boat will soon be here and available, as she will now be required to keep the efficient guard needed and to protect these banks from robbery or injury. G. VANE, Superintendent, Pearl Fishery. No. 3.—B 'Z, [Extract from the Fishery Inspection Report of November, 1862.] Pulipangeodey, December 9, 1862. It is not possible to make proper inspections of the banks in the time occupied on inspections as at present conducted, and there are many intervals of fine weather during the north-east monsoon during which inspection operations might be carried on and much valuable information regarding the banks obtained, if the Supervisor had the means at his disposal of carrying on such operations whenever the weather was favourable. An efficient guard could also be kept over the banks if a proper vessel were placed on them. ■ 4 --u ji • n auxi p ai jT screw vessel of about 80 or 100 tons, well manned and found in stores, boats, &amp;c., m c ijers attached to her, might be placed on the banks at a cost very little exceeding that now incurred by Government in sending the steamer and keeping up the present establishment of schooner, boats, and men. x o r The schooner “ Ceylon ” and barge might be attached to the vessel as tenders, their crews being supplied from the vessel whenever it becomes necessary to employ them. rvi,vmi^ a ! r l S 01 i 1T + t ? have A 0 that . nine °f the iron buoys and ten of the anchors sent from accounts ^ ° St dimng tlie last ins P ection , and I beg to request authority to strike them off my mi P . 1 m! i e a r L ®? dea J 0 U L WaS made to find - the buoys, but they had either sunk or gone adrift, the bnnlftW«X f 0 r p^ hem Tt ! 6 ^ and 0n ins P ec tion were found to be rotten, and some of wi ter ^On a wna „• ^ i 0m ^ ^ avin S been properly soldered up about the bung gradually filled with water.

Donnan recommending purchase of a vessel specially for work on the Pearl Banks.] Steamer “ General Havelock,” Off Silavatturai, March 27, 1867. Slfb With reference to our letter of this day’s date reporting the result of the late inspection and the finding of young oysters on the Cheval Paar (which will probably yield a fishery in six years, will render necessary careful inspections twice a year, and will require to be efficiently watched and guarded), we have the honour to submit for the consideration of Government the advisability of purchasing a vessel specially for service on the pearl banks, as we believe that the work required to be done by us during inspections and by the Naturalist in his researches into the natural history of the pearl oysters could be much more economically and satisfactorily performed by means of a vessel specially adapted for such services than by hired steamers and sailing vessels, and really efficient guard could be kept over the banks during the north-east monsoon, when it is presumed the Naturalist will generally be employed on or near the banks off Arippu. At present Government hire a steamer for the inspections, a sailing vessel for the Naturalist, and keep up the schooner “ Ceylon ” (a most inefficient vessel for the purpose) to guard the banks. A vessel of about 100 tons, in all respects an efficient sailing vessel, fitted with small steam power and a lifting screw propeller with cabin accommodation for three or four persons, built of wood or on the composite principle, viz., iron framing with wooden planking, sheathed with copper (so as to render unnecessary constant cleaning as the “ Pearl ” required), would suffice for the various services required to be performed. We enclose letters, plans, and specification for such a vessel on the compo'site principle furnished at the request of Captain Donnan by the eminent shipbuilders, Messrs. Steele*&amp; Co., of Greenock. We annex statements showing the present cost of hiring steamers and sailing vessels and keeping up the schooner “ Ceylon,” and of the cost of purchasing and keeping of such a vessel as we have referred to for six years, by which it will be seen that there will be a positive saving of at least £7,000 (seven thousand) in that time, if our recommendation were adopted, with the certainty of the work being more efficiently and satisfactorily performed. In any case we would recommend the schooner “ Ceylon ” being disposed of, as she is a most expensive vessel for her size to keep up, and quite useless for any service on the banks except to serve as a mark.

The Superintendent of the Pearl Fishery and The Inspector of the Pearl Banks. I have, &amp;c., ALLANSON BAILEY, for Colonial Secretary, No. 3.—E [Answer to the Reply of the Government.] No&gt; 9 ^ Mannar Kachcheri, April 26, 1867. Sir, 5 —In reply to your letter No. 11 of the 5th instant, conveying His Excellency the Gover nor’s decision, not to incur at present the expense of purchasing a new vessel for the pearl banks, as recommended in our letter dated the 27th ultimo “Off Silavatturai, we have the honour to submit the following explanation of that letter, which appears to us not to have been clearly understood. As regards the original cost of the vessel being understated, we allowed a sum of £4,000 as the cost of the vessel delivered in England ready for sea, which left a margin of over £300 above the cost of the vessel as stated in the letter of Messrs. Steele &amp; Co., which we enclosed, and for sailing her out to Ceylon we allowed £500, which sum we feel confident would cover all expenses of the passage out. The only item we left out was that of insurance, which could be effected in England for about £150 for the voyage. This would of course cover all risk to the vessel and the machinery. As regards the sum we allowed for the hire of a vessel for the Naturalist, we were not of course aware of the intentions of Government on that point; but if our recommendation were adopted, the vessel would no doubt be occupied by the Naturalist during the intervals between the usual inspections, and some allowance should therefore be made, on that account, in contrasting the saving to be effected under the proposed change with that of the present system. The saving of £1,200 representing the upkeep of the schooner “ Ceylon ” for six years ^can only be looked upon as a saving if our recommendation were adopted, as, although the “ Ceylon” is entirely unfitted for the service, it is to be presumed some other vessel will be got to supply her place when she is disposed of. As regards the sum representing the value of the vessel at the end of six years being required to cover insurance, we never intended in our calculations that any insurance should be effected. Seeing the secure nature of the duty the vessel Avould have to perform, and that she would be always at anchor during the night, and have always a secure and safe anchorage to run for, in the event of a gale of wind arising, we think it would be perfectly safe to dispense with any insurance on her. It would be as necessary to have had the “ Ceylon ” insured since she came out as it would be to insure the proposed new vessel. As regards coaling the vessel for the use of the Naturalist, we intend that the proposed vessel should be fully rigged for sailing, and do all the work required by him under sail alone, which she would be perfectly able to do, being to all intents and purposes a sailing vessel with the propeller lifted, which is provided for in the plants and specification forwarded with our former letter.Lastly, \ e may mention that oar estimate of the cost of the vessel’s upkeep is an extreme one, as stated m our former letter, which we made merely as a contrast with the present expensive system, but there is no doubt that the vessel could be worked at £200 a year less than we stated. ^ ^ will therefore oe seen that if our plan were adopted in its entirety, a large saving would be eStected. In the statement attached to our former letter we merely compared the two systems for a period of six years, but as the vessel we propose would be guaranteed to class at Lloyd’s A 1 for twelve years, and be in all probability a vessel that would last for twenty years, the greater the number of years the two systems are contrasted the greater will be the saving in favour of our proposition. We have, &amp;c., W. C. TWYNAM, Superintendent, Pearl Fishery. JAMES DONNAN, Inspector, Pearl Fishery. No. 3.—F. [Extract from Pearl Fishery Inspector’s Report of November, 1869.] November 10, 1869. I believe that during the inspection of November last a few scattered oysters were found on the south-east Cheval, and if there can be any certainty that the present patch of oysters was then examined, there would appear to have been a great increase of numbers on the ground since that time. I am of opinion that the oysters found on this occasion are some of those of six weeks old that were found in great numbers adhering to weed in the 1858 fishery ground in March, 1867, and that they were drifted on to their position about one mile to the north-east during the succeeding south-west monsoon of that year.* No. 3.—F 1. [In connection with the above extract from same Report complaining of difficulty in hiring a vessel and consequent loss of time and unsatisfactory inspection.] In connection with this subject I have to report that a week of fine weather for inspection work was lost before I left Colombo in consequence of the vessel which I had engaged to proceed to the pearl banks not having arrived in Colombo at the time arranged, and as day after day of suitable weather passed without the arrival of the vessel, I was at last obliged to engage and prepare in a hurry the schooner “Morning Star,” a vessel quite unsuited for the service; and, indeed, the vessel I had at first engaged is unsuited for the service, but is the best adapted for it of any vessel trading to Colombo. I respectfully submit that if the pearl bank service is to be properly carried out, a vessel should be in readiness to proceed on the first appearance of suitable weather, and not for the Inspection Establishment to be in waiting on the arrival of a vessel; otherwise an entire season may be lost, and the consequences fatal’ to a fishery, should mature oysters be on the banks. There are no vessels belonging to Colombo adapted to this service, and in addition to the officers of the Pearl Fishery Establishment being subjected to great personal discomfort while on board of such vessels by having to put up with very indifferent accommodation, minus the usual conveniences and swarming with vermin, the work performed by them is very unsatisfactory and incomplete. At the late inspection I was unable to check the work done by the boats, as I have been accustomed to do, by going over the same ground with the inspection vessel and sending down divers from it occasion ally. If I had attempted to do so with the vessel employed on this occasion, it would have been drifted off the ground altogether, and would have taken hours to regain position. I had therefore to be contented with remaining at anchor, and trusting entirely to the reports given in by the coxs wains of the inspection boats, which it is very desirable there should be some means of checking. I am unwilling to urge upon Government the purchase of a vessel for this service at a time when there is no prospect of a return for it in the shape of a fishery, but as the service is a constantly recurring one every year, and if it is to be carried out as it should be, I see no other course left. Some steps might be taken during the absence of oysters on the banks to reduce the upkeep of a vessel to a minimum by laying it up in Colombo under the charge of the Master Attendant’s Department, and engaging a temporary crew when required for each occasion of inspecting the banks. I have, &amp;c., JAMES DONNAN. Appendix No. 4. No. 4.—A. [Extract from the Diary Inspection Report of Mr. Yane in November, 1861.] I first directed my attention to the main object of this inspection, namely, the ascertaining if any portion of the south-east Modragam remained for fishing in 1862, but I regret to say that neither old oysters, dead shells, or young were to be found. This latter circumstance, namely, the absence of young oysters, shows this bed to have been thoroughly fished, indeed gleaned, in 1860; and although then a profitable proceeding, it was not, in my opinion, a politic one, as I know the fish to have been too young, and believe that had they been left as I recommended until 1861, the mature oysters would have spawned during 1860 and left in their young a more profitable future in 1867 than even the produce of 1860 realized. On the south and northern edge there are abundance of healthy oysters of two to three years, the young of the oysters fished in 1859, which should yield a large fishery in 1865-66. I then examined on the bearings noted by Mr. Worsley on his chart and diary of 1859 as * It has been since shown that this was false spat.—W. C.

[Extract from the Pearl Fishery Report of Mr. Vane in April, 1862.] Modragam. There are oysters on this bank from three to four years, very healthy, and abundantly covering a snace of about a mile square, thickest on the southern part, and should be fishable m 1865; and now momise a yield of at least 15,000 a boat for 100 boats for ten to fifteen days, but this must be determined by an examination in November, 1863. , , , . determinea oy circumstances connected with the migratmn of oysters, under which known beds have dTsappeared a nd others have been found, are exemplified by the present condition of he Modraglm. At the inspection of November, 1860, Captain Pritchard found on the bearings of he nresen? bed, which is in fact precisely that of the fishing ground of 1859-60 oysters of eight to twelve months old which oysters were seen by me in November, 1861, and considered of two years, and yet nnw after five months the oysters on the same spot are considered by all parties to be three and four years • and Mr Worsley, who fished this ground in 1859 and 1860, is satisfied that no oysters of such an aae as the present could have been formed here, and their presence then is only to be accounted for bv the supposition that they have been drifted into their present position as I think most pro- bablv from the Karativu banks. It is to be hoped they will now remain where they are, as they Ire very much protected by the Karativu shoal, which is indeed the great protection from the strong south-west winds and currents of both the Modragam and the Cheval, and m part accounts, m my opinion, for the continued productiveness of these banks. Cheval Paar. A glance at the chart No. 5 will show, especially in contrast to the Modragam bed, the exten sive promise of fisheries from the Cheval. The present is, I apprehend, the largest and most compact bed ever found, as the whole of the enormous space shown inside the dotted lines is fully covered with oysters, most abundantly so on the north and north-west portion. The southern end, the part I found last November, and which I then estimated to give a fishery this year for 100 boats for fifteen to twenty days at loads of 15,000 to 20 , 000 , is the smallest and least covered portion and evidently the oldest. From the number of dead shells found, averaging some 10 per cent, of the dives, I now consider that had the whole of this bank been fishable this March it would have yielded at least 25,000 to 30,000 a boat to 300 boats for twenty to twenty-five days. The fisheries of 1855, 1857, 1858, and 1859 from the Cheval yielded 60,000,000 oysters, the fishing for many days of 1857 being to 1£ million. The extent of the ground then covered with oysters was very much less than the present, and consisted of three patches or beds ; but the present is all one, and I therefore consider my supposition as to present quantity exceeding a hundred million of oysters 5 not excessive. The natural decay which has commenced at the south end, and proves that portion to be the oldest and first for fishing, will reduce this quantity, and may do so materially ; hut I believe the south and eastern portions will afford as many as, if not more than, our means of boats and divers will allow to be fished next year, and that the northern and western portion, on which the oysters are in some particulars apparently younger, and amongst which but few dead shells were found, will give a large fishery in 1864 and possibly for 1865. It may be said, Why not, as decay has commenced on the southern portion, have fished this year ? In my letter of November last I expressed the opinion that the oysters were too young, and the outturn of light small pearls showed this. On the present occasion I opened a few oysters and found the pearls therein of the same small and light character, but promising to be very plentiful in the future, as in one there were twenty-five pearls the size of a pin’s head and one a little larger. It is said not to be wise to count too much upon your chickens, and the realizing of results from oysters is quite as precarious; but as the Cheval and Modragam Paars, with less promise of extent, yielded in the fisheries of 1855 to 1860 £140,301, I do confidently hope from the present aspect of promise that unless unforeseen circumstances occur they will yield between 1863 and 1866 at least £200,000. A sample of 10,000 oysters must be taken from the south and east portion in October or November next, and as an estimate of the probable outturn of pearls and revenue therefrom at the fishery of March, 1863. Vangalle Paar. A large bed of four months old oysters covering ground to the extent of three miles has been discovered. They are very healthy and plentiful, and if they remain over the coming monsoon there will be hope of a fishery ; but as the ground is not rocky, and they are on sand and attached only to shell, they are likely to be carried away by the current of the south-west monsoon. This bank has never produced a fishery, although young oysters have been before found thereon, and therefore we must not be sanguine of results from this find. The bed must be watched, and if the oysters are not found thereon, endeavour must be made to trace them, as in the south-west monsoon they would be carried to the adjoining reef, but in the north-east monsoon out into deep water. The remainder of the banks on the coast of Mannar and Jaffna as well as all likely ground for the deposit of oysters have been, as will be seen by reference to the diaries and the general chart No. 4, thoroughly examined, but no present promise of oysters found. Mr. Worsley is preparing a set of charts upon a large scale for office record, showing more fully and more in detail than the transcript charts annexed hereto the work done at this inspection ; and I believe from the professional knowledge and acquirements he has for the work that they will supply the long-needed want of a correct pearl fishery chart.No. 4.—A 2.

The native divers confirmed the statement. This bank will probably yield a good fishery in 1865 or 1866. Frorn the English Modragam we steamed over the old Dutch Modragam Paar, but found nothing on it. We then proceeded to the north-west portion of the Cheval and made an inspection of it, taking up a sample of 10,000. The oysters were reported to be lying thick and to be healthv- looking, but youngei than those on the south-east Oheval. They will probably be fit for fishing in 1864, and the two portions of the Cheval, viz., the south-east and north-west, will, it is expected, yield good fisheries in 1863,1864, and 1865. No. 4.—B 1.

He also stated that he saw the snakes eating the oysters. There are an immense number of snakes on these banks, and some of them are very large. [Extract from the Fishery Inspection Diary of 1863.] Mr. Peachy returned to the ship at 4 P.M, and reported that he had gone across from the south west to the south-east buoy, but could not get on the bank, the barge having been driven off it. He went over what appeared to him to be the northern limit of the ground fished this year, and found only a few dead shells and here and there an oyster. The sand has been slightly washed over the bank since the fishery and lies in small ridges. He scraped away some of the sand, but found only dead shells. [Extract from the Diary of November 14, 1863.] He (the European diver) tried to go down towards the south-east buoy, but was prevented by the current, and so returned in the gig to the steamer, having left the “William” to continue inspecting. [Extract from the Inspection Diary of November 19, 1865.] No oysters of any description were found—young or old. Some old dead shells were picked up on the fishing ground of 1859. The native divers report the ground rocky on the west and sandy with patches of rock on the east and south-east. They say that the rock has in many places been covered with sand which appears to have been drifted over it. The European diver went across the patch from south-east to north-west. He confirms the report of the native divers. No. 4.—B 2. [Extract from the Fishery Inspection Report of December, 1862.] The European diver (Peachy) confirmed the statement of the native divers. He stated that for about half or three-quarters of an hour he walked over a bed of oysters lying so deep and thick as to completely hide the bottom. He then came on oysters in patches and then on sand. He also stated that he had seen the snakes eating the oysters, and had come on the shells of several which had been recently eaten. He also saw a flat fish* with a snout like a pig’s preying on the oysters. He was of opinion from what he saw that there was every prospect of a large fishery next year. [Extract from Fishery Inspection Diary of Mr. Worsley, November 8, 1862.] The English divers report that the snakes which abound on the pearl banks seem to prey upon the oysters, as they could see them darting into the shells when open. [Extract from the Inspection Diary, March 12, 1864.] I think it right to record the result of an experiment made on board to-day with a sea-snake, which proved beyond a doubt that the bite of one species at least of the many on the banks is poisonous. Two snakes in very close connection (during which operation these animals appear to be in a drowsy listless state and are easily caught) were picked up alongside, and remained together for about two hours after they were brought on board. When they separated a chicken was thrown at them several times, and the male became at last irritated and seized it by the legs, making wounds in the lower part of them. The chicken gradually became drowsy and dropped on the deck, the wounds becoming black and the head a dark purple. Within four minutes it died with a convulsive shudder, a quantity of foam coming out of the mouth. This was probably the Trigger fish.—W. C. T.( 48 ) No. 4.—C.

We inspected the Kudai Paar on Mon ay morning. It is an extensive bank, and has oysters on it of all ages—from one month to six years. Mr. Worsley appears to think that the sample taken up in November, 1861, was taken up from it instead of from the portion of the lank now being fished. A narrow strip of sand separates! from the ground now being fished.

If this patch be thoroughly fished next year, there is no probability of any further fishery iron 1 the Cheval Paar for five or six years to come, as no young oysters were found on any part of it. dne inspection of this bank occupied five days. We then proceeded to the Periya Paar and found an extent of ground at least three miles bj two thickly covered with young oysters about six months old. These oysters may probably spread over the Cheval and Modragam Paars and replenish them. A sample of the oysters is sent herewith to Colombo.Modragam Paar, Destruction of. ^arge fishery in 1865. 'The oysters first appeared on this bank in November, 1860, and were then supposed to be about six months old. they could 2 iot therefore now have been more than four or four and half years old and from the appeal ance of the shells brought up there is little doubt that they have been destroyed by some animals preying on them.

The result of the inspection goes to show that if the Cheval Paar be thoroughly fished next year there is no prospect of any further fisheries for at least five years to come, as there are no young oysters to be found on any of the banks except the Periya Paar, and they appear to be only about six months old. Then steamed out to the westward to the Periya Paar, and on anchoring on the supposed position of it sent down a diver in 10 fathoms, who brought up a number of bunches of young oysters only five or six months old—the Adigar says about 12 months old. Placed a buoy to mark the spot and steamed all round it at about half a mile from it. The diver was sent down repeatedly, and always brought up similar bunches of young oysters; one bunch was broken up and found to contain 240 young oysters from half an inch to an inch in diameter, and some not bigger than a large fly. The divers reported the ground covered with young oysters in bunches. All the dives were made in 9 | and 10 fathoms with sandy bottom. Kallatidal, Kondachy, and Vankalai Paars. Result of Inspection.

These moved off as the fishery pro- oressed. When going in one day from the “ Sky Rocket ” to Silavatturai during the fishery the boat came across a number of those skates half way between the vessel and the shore, and one of the most experienced native divers remarked to me at the time that there must be oysters close by, as these animals preyed on them. The natives say that they are most destructive to the young oysters. From the appearance of the shells there is no doubt that the oysters have been preyed upon. Some of the shells have been eaten half through. Could the bank have been destroyed soon after the last fishery, or during the fishery by the skates when frightened off the Cheval Paar ? The oysters were very healthy in November last, and certainly do not appear from the reports of the divers to have died off naturally. Ao. 4.—L. [Extract from Pearl Fishery Diary of November, 1863.] November 20, 1863. Laid down an iron buoy moored with a chain and gfapnel to mark the shoal. This buoy will be left on the shoal till the next fishery or inspection. Captain Donnan recommended a permanent buoy being put down, and from what I have seen during this inspection I would certainly suggest that his recommendation be adopted. It is not possible to take proper bearings of objects on the shore from the Cheval and Periya Paars. The flagstaffs placed on the hills at Kallaar and Kudiraimalai have both come down, but even when up it was almost impossible to get a sight of them, especially during the forenoon. The northern edge of the Karativu shoal if buoyed off would afford a good starting point from which to carry on an inspection of all the banks, as a vessel anchored on it can be distinctly seen from all of them, as has been proved during this inspection. I believe the placing of any buoys on or near the banks has been objected to* on the ground that it would lead to the banks being trespassed on and robbed by Sinhalese fishermen and others. I do not think myself that a buoy on the Karativu shoal or even one on the Cheval Paar itself would any more assist the fishermen in finding the banks than flagstaffs at Kallaar and Kudiraimalai. ^The Cheval Paar is the great fishing ground of the Sinhalese fishermen, and the position of it During the north-east monsoon the bank is covered with their canoes. is well known to them. * See Steuart’s “Account ”•—W. 0.

[Report by Mr. Twynam of Destruction of Oysters on Banks and Total Loss of Yaluable Fishery anticipated in March, 1864.] F Steamer “ Pearl,” March 12, 1864. 5 1 n’~ + lN acknowledging the receipt of your letter No. 29 of the 8 th instant, I have the honour respectfully to submit that I was under the impression from the tenour of your telegram of the 23rd ultimo that I was to make a thorough inspection of the banks and then to make a full report regarding them, and directions conveyed to me in the telegram of the 5 th were to make a full report at the close of the inspection, and I have to express my regret that there should have been any misapprehension on my part. The steamer arrived at Silavatturai on the afternoon of the 16th ultimo, and after landing the stores brought up in her we proceeded on the afternoon of the 18th to the banks and anchored for the night on the patch it was proposed to fish, as no difficulty was experienced in finding it in consequence of a buoy having been placed on the northern extremity of the Karativu shoal in November fast, distant about 1^ mile from the bank, the distance having been run on both occasions by Massey’s patent log. The 19th and 20th were not favourable for inspection work, as the wind was blowing fresh from the south-west, and there was a heavy swell which interfered much with the divers. The reports then made by them, however, regarding the state of the bank were most.unsatis factory. On the 21st and 22nd the weather was in every way favourable, and the sea quite smooth, and it was then ascertained beyond a doubt that the oysters had either died off or been destroyed. The divers succeeded in bringing up only 575 oysters during the four days, and they reported the ground covered with dead shells and pieces of shells with very few live oysters left. The examination of the bank was carried on carefully in all directions round the patch eastward as far as the Kallatidal Paar, northward beyond the limit of the Cheval Paar, and the ground fished in 1857 southward to the Karativu shoal and westward into 8 fathoms. No oysters, however, of any description were found on any part of it except on the patch that was to have been fished. The European diver was sent down four times and worked right across the patch east and west and north and south. He fully confirmed the reports of the native divers. He expressed himself as having walked knee-deep in broken shells which were lying in heaps as if piled up by the hand, and said that he did not think more than one live oyster could be got for twelve dead ones, and that the oysters he saw were all of the Goda Paar description, the same as those which formed the sample of November. As it was quite evident that there was an end to all hopes of a fishery, I considered it my duty to at once to telegraph to Government the result of the inspection. On the 23rd the boats, four in number, were sent out with three divers in each with orders to the coxswains to fish as much as they possibly could—in fact, to work as if they were working on their own account at a fishery—and to bring to the ship all they got, dead or alive. The result of the day’s work was quite conclusive as to the state of the bank. With everything in their favour, and after working from 6 a.m. till 4 P.M., the divers brought up only 2,400 live oysters and 1,900 dead shells. At this rate it would have taken a week to have made up the sample. The divers reported that there were not oysters sufficient to afford good fishing for even twelve boats for a day ; that they had experienced great difficulty in bringing up what they did from the quantity of broken shells on the ground, netfuls of which were brought up and thrown overboard. The oysters fished were all taken on shore on the 24th and sold by public auction. 2,900 were sold for £39. 3s. 6c7. The dead shells are all on board and will be sent to Colombo for inspection. On receipt of your telegram of the 23rd I at once despatched the following telegram to the Masters Attendant of Negapatam and Tuticorin, Major Syme of Paumben,and the Collector of Madura:—“Please circulate information that there will not be a fishery at Aripu, Ceylon, this year : oysters all dead.” I also telegraphed to some merchants of Negapatam and Kilikarai, and to Mr. Riedy at Paumben, requesting him to send messengers to Ramnad and Kilikarai with the information. I also succeeded, by sending a letter by express to the Government Agent as well as a telegram through Negapatam, in stopping the Jaffna fishery establishments which were just about leaving Jaffna for Silavatturai. On the 24th Ave proceeded to Silavatturai and found on landing that no diving boats, divers, or merchants had arrived, and only one pearl trader from Kilikarai. The place was in fact quite empty, and I have since learnt that the telegrams reached in time to stop the boats which were about leaving the ports on the coast. Eighteen Jaffna boats however came as far as Mannar. The preparation for the fishery at Silavatturai had all been completed by the 20th. As regards the cause of the destruction of the oysters, Avhich Avere to all appearance healthy in November last, I must beg to submit that it is not possible for me to give a decided opinion, nor do I think it would be possible for any one to do so with our present limited knowledge of every thing connected Avith the pearl oyster. . i , . , x 1 „ From the appearance of some of the shells, Avhich Avere quite bright and clean, and of a few to which pieces of flesh Avere sticking, there is no doubt that many of the oysters had recently died off. The bulk of them had however, I believe, been destroyed by some animals preying on them.

Donnan on the foregoing.] Silavatturai, March 24, 1864. g IR&gt; —W e have the honour to forward— (1) Copies of our diaries kept during the late inspection. (2) A map of the ground inspected. (3) The A digar’s report. (4) A statement of work done daily by the divers. The inspection was commenced on the 18th February, when we steamed out to the Cheval Paar and anchored on the patch that was to have been fished, which we had no difficulty in finding, as a buoy had been placed on the Karativu shoal in fathoms and about If mile from the bed of oysters at the close of the last inspection, in order to serve as a mark to enable us to find it, as from its limited extent we anticipated there might be some trouble in doing so by means of bearings taken to objects on the land which can never be seen distinctly from the banks. The bearing of the Karativu shoal buoy from the central buoy on the patch during the inspection had been carefully taken and the distance between them run by Massey’s patent log. During the 19th and 20th very little work was done, as the wind was fresh from the south west with a heavy swell which interfered much with the divers. On the 21st and 22nd the weather was fine and in every way favourable for inspection work, audit was then ascertained beyond a doubt that the oysters had almost all died off or been destroyed. The native divers only succeeded in bringing up during the four days 572 oysters, and reported the ground covered with dead shells and pieces of shell with scarcely oysters sufficient left to afford half a day’s fishing for 75 boats. The European diver was sent down four times and walked across the bed of oysters east and west and north and south, tie fully confirmed the reports of the native divers. Copies of the reports made by him in writing are annexed. In order to satisfy ourselves that none of the oysters had drifted to other parts of the bank, and that there were no patches remaining anywhere from which a fishery might be obtained, the whole of the Cheval Paar from northward of the ground fished in 1857, which is its 'northern extremity, to the Karativu shoal to the south, and from the Kallatidal Paar on the east to as far as 9 fathoms to the west, was carefully inspected with the steamer and boats, but no oysters, young or old, were found anywhere except the few remaining on the ground that was to have been fished. Having fully satisfied ourselves, therefore, that all hope of a fishery was at an end, a report of the state of the bank was made by telegram to Government, and instructions were received on the evening of the 23rd to stop all further preparations for a fishery, to give notice that there would not be a fishery, and to make a thorough inspection of all the banks. On the 23rd the boats, four in number, with three divers in each, were sent out with orders to X^XX UXXW X-^XVf. UXXV, ^ A ^ ^ A ? »VAV1AX uxxx^u Xti. V D All. TDCMjU.) W work where the oysters were the thickest, and to bring to the ship all that were brought up, alive or dead. The result of the day’s work was quite conclusive as to the state of the bank. After working from 6 A M. till 4 p.m. with everything in their favour, the divers succeeded in bringing up only( 53 ) 2,400 oysters and 1,900 dead shells. The divers in fact reported that they had almost cleared the oank and that there were not oysters sufficient even for a dozen boats ; that they had experienced great ^ffity in getting what they did from the state of the ground, which was covered thick with dead shells and pieces of shell, netfuls of which were thrown overboard. All the oysters brought up were taken on shore on the 24th, and 2,900 were sold in Silavatturai for £39. 3s. 6 d The dead shells affll a quantity of broken pieces of shell are sent to Colombo for inspection. What the real cause of the destruction of the bank was it is not possible for us to state. There is no doubt that many of the oysters had recently died off as some of the shells were quite bright and clean. The bulk of them had however, to all appearance, been destroyed, and the native divers attributed their destruction to skates, numbers of which have been seen on the banks during the last twelve months. Chanks, snakes, and certain species of fish it is well known prey on the oysters and there is very little doubt that when a bank is preyed on to any extent, as this must have’been, that the oysters not actually destroyed die off in consequence of being scattered over the bank whereas in their natural state they adhere to each other in small clusters. The oysters and dead shells brought up were all found in the spot on which the oysters were found in November last, and were all of the same description, viz., the Goda Paar, and it was quite evident therefore that the patch had not been swept away by currents. We have reason to believe, however, from what has fallen under our observation, that the age at which oysters ought to be fished is not known, and the loss of so many oysters on the Oheval Paar in the interval between the inspection of November, 1862, and the fishery of 1863 is attributable in a great measure, we think, to ignorance on this point. At the inspection of November, 1862, it was reported by the divers that the oysters were dying off, and when the fishery was commenced in March, 1863, it was found that more than half had died after the inspection. These oysters must, in our opinion, have been old enough to have been fished in March, 1862, and might have then yielded a fair fishery. As an instance of how little is known on this point, we may remark that in November, 1860, Captain Donnan, when inspecting the banks with Captain Pritchard, saw the oysters which have since been destroyed on the Modragam. They were then quite young, about the size of a sixpenny- piece, and apparently not above four months old, which was also the opinion of the Adigar. They would now, therefore, have been only four years old at the utmost, and yet Mr. Vane estimated them as about 3| years old in March, 1862, and Mr. Worsley as about 3| or 4 years old in November, 1862, and both Mr. Worsley and the Adigar, at the inspection of November, 1862, considered that they would yield a good fishery in 1865, at which time if they had lived they would only have been five years old. Whereas, according to the present theory, they would only then have commenced to form pearls, and would not have been ready for fishing till 1867, as the age at which oysters ought to be fished is now supposed to be 6 ^ or 7 years. We would therefore strongly recommend that careful inspections be made of the banks at least twice a year, in November and March, in order that it may be ascertained, if possible, how the Cheval and Modragam Paars are replenished, as, according to the nati ve ideas on the subject, the oysters found on these banks are not produced from spawn deposited on them by the old oysters left on them after a fishery, but are drifted on them when young from the Periya Paar, to which they are carried in clusters from the gulf, where the spawn is deposited in deep water. The Adigar informs us that he has seen the sea in the direction of the Periya Paar covered with young oysters in clusters floating on the surface, and the Periya Paar is called by the natives the Mother Bank, as it is from it that the other banks are replenished. It should be carefully noted when oysters again appear on these banks, and they should then be watched till they come to maturity, and the age at which they are ready for fishing ascertained, and this can only be done by having regular inspections of the banks. On receiving instructions to make a thorough inspection of all the banks we determined on examining carefully the whole of the ground south of the reef as far as the Pukulam river, and from 4 fathoms to the east to 10 fathoms to the west, between which limits the principal banks are situate, and to enable us to make a thorough inspection of the ground we adopted the plan of buoying off and examining daily an extent equal to about 4 square miles, which was easily done by means of Massey’s patent log. We accordingly proceeded towards Kudiramalai on the morning of the 26th, and as will be seen by the annexed chart of our proceedings we worked up from south to north on the east of the Cheval, and then from north to south across the Cheval and to the west of it, over an extent of ground equal to 68 square miles. The Periya Paar, the Kondachy, Arippu, Vankalai, Anaivilundan, Karativu Paars, which do not appear on the chart, were also carefully inspected. The result of the inspection has been, we regret to state, most unsatisfactory, and there is now no prospect whatever of a fisher } 7 for at least six years to come. Over the whole extent of ground gone over, with the exception of the Periya Paar and the Karativu Paar, only 400 young oysters were found, and those only scattered ones which never come to maturity. On the Periya Paar we found some young oysters in 10 fathoms, which appeared to be the same as those seen in November last, but in nothing like the same quantity ; they were two miles further to the west, and.were scattered over the bank instead of being in clusters. They seemed to be about twelve months old. On the Karativu Paar a bed of young oysters about 300 feet in length and 60 feet in breadth was found ; they were also about twelve months old, but did not appear healthy, and will not come, we think, to maturity. . The Modragam was carefully inspected during two days. As reported, however, m November the oysters have died off. There are no young oysters on it at present. We have, &amp;c., W. C.

The steamer arrived off the south bar of Mannar on the 10th instant, and we proceeded on the of the 11th to the Anaivilundan Paar, off Talaimannar, the inspection of which we morning completed on that day. „ m . ,i tt- i t ^ On the 12th and 13th we inspected the Nadukuda Paar, also off Talaimannar, the Yankalai and Arippu Paars, and the ground between them. Only a few scattered oysters were found on these banks. On the morning of the 14th we commenced the inspection of the Cheval Paar, and were engaged on it and the Modragam and Kallatidal Paars up to the evening of the 21st. We found the ground on the southern portion of the Cheval Paar, which was fished in 1858 and 1863, and that on the north-west fished in 1859, covered with weed growing on the rocks, to which young oysters from about X V to £ of an inch in diameter, and apparently from three to six weeks old, were adhering in myriads, the weed being perfectly black with them. The ground thus covered would be in all about 2 square miles in extent. We found no young oysters, however, on the extreme north-west on the ground fished in 1857, and very few on the west on the portion of the bank called the Goda Paar, which failed in 1864, but the ground was covered with weed similar to that on which the young oysters were found on the south and north-west on the fishing ground of 1859. Prom the appearance of the young oysters and their immense number and the quantity of weed now on the bank, there seems to be some prospect of the bank being replenished, but no decided opinion can be formed as to the probability of the oysters remaining on the bank and spreading over it until after an inspection has been made in November next at the close of the coming south-west monsoon. On the Modragam Paar and between it and the Cheval Paar we found no oysters of any description. Like the Cheval Paar, however, the Modragam is more covered with weed than on previous inspections, which leads us to hope that the young oysters Avill spread over it also. On the Kallatidal Paar only a few scattered oysters were found. On the 22nd we inspected the ground called the Periya Paar, but found nothing on it, and then steamed down to the Karativu Paar, and on the 23rd inspected it and the ground south of it as far as Dutch Bay, but found only a few scattered oysters. On the 24th the weather was unfavourable for inspection work, and we remained at anchor on the Karativu shoal and shifted the moorings of the buoy. On the 25th, after assisting Mr. Holds worth to place near the shoal buoy in 3^ fathoms an iron tank with some young oysters picked up on the south-east Cheval in it, we proceeded in the afternoon to the Kondachy Paar, which we inspected on the morning of the 26th and then proceeded to the Arku Paar close to it, which we inspected in the afternoon. On these banks also we found only a few scattered oysters, and closed the inspection. We have, &amp;c., W. C. TWYNAM. J.

The SOun 1 de 1 d over the H P atch a11 round the buoy put down yesterday and found the patch about halt a mile by a quarter in extent, the line of it being distinctly visible from the shin from the deeper green of the water over it, the line of the shoal itself being clearly defined from the ground beyond it by the green colour of the water. At about 9 a.m. coxswain Junasy made the signal that he had found the tank on the patch about half a mile from the ship. It was buoyed immediately and Captain Leighton and I, accompanied by the European diver, Mr. Peachy, went to inspect it. The coxswain informed us that whilst sounding he found the water suddenly shoal from 3| to less than 3 fathoms ; and as he knew by certain marks on the land which he had fixed when the tank was put down last year that he could not be far from it, he sent down a diver, who reported that they had come on the tank, which was not however at the time visible from the boat, being covered with sand and weed. The sand and weed having been scraped away by the divers, the tank was distinctly visible from the boat. Before going to the tank we went to the shoal buoy, put down Massey’s patent log, pulled for the tank and found the distance half a mile, then placed a boat 40 fathoms from the tank W.S.W. to mark the original position of the shoal buoy, which, as we had found the tank, we had no difficulty in fixing, and found that the shoal buoy had drifted in a north-easterly direction half a mile. It had drifted therefore in the direction in which it is natural to suppose it would have drifted during the south-west monsoon, and not in the direction of the Modragam bank. Had it moved and put down in its proper position. The shoal buoy did not drift at all during 1866, and we found it all right at the commencement of the inspection of 1867. I believe the chain must have fouled the anchor last year when it was put down, and having become too short caused the buoy to jirk the anchor off the ground during the heavy swell of the south-west monsoon. Mr. Holdsworth moved the “Geraldine ” down to the tank in order, if possible,to raise it, but did not succeed in doing so. No. 0 —I).

The divers reported the bank much more covered with weed than usual, and the rock in many places covered over with sand which had drifted over the bank during the south-west monsoon. On the west and south-west of the bank however, and about a quarter of a mile from it, quantities of drift weed were found covered with what were supposed to be young oysters last year, in size, shape, and colour exactly like those found last year on the Cheval Paar.* The extent of ground covered with the weed, which was drifting apparently towards the Modragam and lying in deep ridges on the sand, would be about half a square mile. Karativu Paar. Ground off Dutch Bay, Karativu island, and Talaville Mondal. On the afternoon of the 25th March we sailed down to the Karativu Paar and were employed on it, and the ground off Karativu island, Dutch Bay, and Talaville Mondal during the 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th. In to 5 fathoms in a line south-west from Kurusady Mondal on Karativu island and four miles from it we came on a patch of ground about three miles in length and a quarter mile in breadth, thickly covered with weed like that found on the Cheval Paar last year, and firmly attached to the rock. Most of the weed was thickly covered with the supposed young oysters, in size, shape, and colour exactly like those found last year on the Cheval Paar and this year near the Modragram. Some of the weed was entirely clear of them, although found close to patches thickly covered with them. Although the ground was well gone over into 9 and 10 fathoms down to Talaville Mondal, no other oysters of any description and very little weed were found beyond the patch referred to. *##***-* Nadukuda and Anaivilundan Paars. We then went on to the Nadukuda and Anaivilundan Paars, which we inspected on the 31st March and 1st April. j . i „ , , u• , , j ^ £ On the Nadukuda Paar we came on a quantity of drift weed which had the appearance of havino- drifted some distance, being in long rolls as if twisted up, covered with some of the supposed young oysters, in size and shape like those found before, but lighter in colour and having to us more the appearance of pearl oysters than those found last year on the Cheval Paar and this year on the * VU.

J From the information given to us, it appears that during some of the inspections made by Captain Steuart previous to the revival of the fisheries in 1855 the banks were covered with shells of the same description as those found last year and again this year, and they were consequently looked on as young pearl oysters, when what were no doubt oysters were subsequently found If not pearl oysters then, are they a species of shell which precede the coming of the peail oysters on the banks ? And can their appearance in such numbers during the last two inspections on different banks be looked on as a sign that the banks are about to be replenished ? That they are young pearl oysters we think extremely doubtful, as they do not m shape and colour resemble, when carefully examined, the smallest pearl oysters, concerning which there can be no doubt, which we have been able to find. This may, however, be owing to their not being sufficie^tl^develope^oui^ ^ desil . a p, le to g et somLe definite information regarding them, and would therefore beg to suggest samples of them being sent to Captain Steuart, late Master Attendant of Colombo and Inspector of Pearl Banks, for his opinion.

Sir,—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 12th instant, transmitted to my residence No. 29, St. George’s Square, Worcester, accompanied by a copy of a despatch from the Governor of Ceylon, a copy of the report of the officers employed in inspecting the pearl banks of that Colony, and a tin box containing samples of the shells of “supposed” pearl oysters, requesting my observations or remarks on them for the information of His Grace the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. 2. In compliance with your request I have opened the said tin box and have found it to contain eight paper parcels of young pearl oysters, all of which I have inspected, replaced, and herewith return to you with the copy of the report on the inspection of the pearl banks and the copy of the despatch from the Governor of Ceylon. 3. My opinion that the shells herewith returned are those of young pearl oysters is not merely founded on my own experience, but on information gained from two generations of native Adapa- naars, or head fishermen, who had served under me and my predecessors. 4. The specimens of young oysters which I now return to you are the fourth that have been transmitted to me. The first, with some observations of Mr, Buckland, came from Mr. E. Rawdon Power, late of the Ceylon Civil Service ; the second came from the Master Attendant, who is now on his return to his duty at Colombo ; and the third came from Mr. Holdsworth, the Naturalist at Ceylon. I lost no time in furnishing the two last-mentioned gentlemen with specimens which Ibrought from Ceylon m 1855, similar to those they had forwarded to me, in order that they might themselves compare them with these shells, of which some doubt as to their being those of pear oysters exists m Ceylon. s pccui ■ * r 5 ' The contents of the letter I received from Mr. Koldsworth hastened the fulfilment of mv intention to deposit in the British Museum, for public inspection, a box containing pearl ov ster shells - ¥ yanous ages and my printed accounts of the Pearl Fisheries of Ceylon, which I personally delivered to the authorities of that institution on the 27th ultimo. &gt; i j 6 .

It occurred 80 rS - 11 aS c t0 111( ^ uce ine cease to entertain expectations of successful pearl fisheries until I found sufficient of two or three years old oysters remaining on the banks to encourage such expectations but sometimes even this disappeared. The cause of such disappearance of oysters from the banks has not been satisfactorily accounted for. It is the only doubt respecting the pearl fisheries existing in my mind. To solve this doubt is, I presume, the primary object in sending Mr. HoJdsworth to Ceylon. Various opinions on the subject are printed in my Account of the Pearl Fisheries, of which copies were transmitted to the Secretary of State, and now others are in the British Museum. 7. It will afford me great pleasure to communicate such information as I possess either personally during the few days I am in London or by letter at Worcester, to which place I hope to return on Tuesday next. I have the means of refreshing my memory on all matters relating to Ceylon since the year 1818. I have, &amp;c., JAMES STEUART. \ 0 . 6 .—(il.

SIR,—I HAVE the honour to report that in accordance with your instructions I have made an inspection of the principal banks off Arippu and of the ground off Karativu island as far as Dutch Bay in order to ascertain if any young oysters had come on the Cheval and Modragam Paars since the last inspection in March, and if the young oysters found on the Nadukuda Paar, near the Modragam Paar, and off Karativu island during the last inspection were still in existence, and if so, in what condition. The inspection was commenced on the morning of the 20th November with the Nadnkuda Paar, which was carefully examined during the 20th and 21st. The young oysters found on this bank at the last inspection were on a small patch of weed firmly attached to rock and on a quantity of drift weed drifting over the rock. The weed and oysters have entirely disappeared. The bank was almost clear of weed of any description, only a small quantity like that found attached to rock having been brought up by the divers, who reported the bank very much covered with sand. The Cheval Paar was inspected during the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th. No young oysters have appeared on any portion of the bank since the last inspection. The weed which was found so thick on this bank during the last two inspections has almost entirely disappeared, very little having been come on by the divers. Another description of weed, however, like that growing on the Kallatidal Paar, and which I noticed at the last inspection as having seen for the first time in any quantity on this bank, is apparently spreading very much over the bank, especially on the south-east, where it is rather thick. On the north and north-east, and on the fishing ground of 1857 and 1859, the divers report the rock very much covered with sand. On the west and south-west however (the Goda Paar as it is called) the rock was more clear of sand, and the peculiar sponge which gives that portion of the bank its name, is, the divers report, very thick over the bank just now. Qnantities of dead shells, the remains of the oysters that were to have been fished in 1864, were brought up from this portion of the bank. The Modragam bank was inspected on the 28th. Nothing was found on it but bare rock and a few dead shells. No young oysters have appeared on it. A small patch of weed like that on which the young oysters were found at the last inspection was come on, but perfectly clear of any now. On the 29th and 30th November and 1st December the patch of ground off Karativu island about three miles in length and half in breadth, south-west of Kurusadi Mondal, and about four miles from the land, was examined. The whole of the young oysters have disappeared with I believe the weed they were on. The ground is however still thickly covered with weed of the same description, but apparently of recent growth. During the three days only 21 oysters of various ages were found in the quantities of mnd and weed brought up by the divers. On the afternoon of the 2nd we were obliged to run into Dutch bay for water, and were detained there by bad weather till the morning of the 7th. On the 7th and &lt; s th the ground to the west of Dutch Bay was examined, but nothing was come on but bare rock and patches of sand. The weather having set in unfavourable on the 9th, and the work it was intended to have done having been completed, I closed the inspection. Copy of my diary is herewith enclosed. I have, &amp;c., W. 0. TWYNAM, Superintendent, 80-02( 58 ) Appendix No. 7. i£r. No. 7.—A. [Extract from the Pearl Fishery Report of May, 1881.] During the inspection of the bank in February Captain Donnan found that full^ 40 per cent, of the oysters had died off since the inspection of November, and the result of the first few days’ fishing was sufficient to show that the oysters had attained maturity (were fully ripe as the people expressed it) and were fast dying off ; the loads brought in having been much below the estimated quantity and a large proportion of dead shells having been brought up by the divers. The oysters over two-thirds of the bank were pronounced good and rich in pearl, and, except that they were much scattered over the bank and mixed with dead shells, the divers experienced no difficulty in fishing them. On the north, however, the oysters were smaller and covered with a growth of coral which seriously interfered with the operations of the divers, who complained much of their hands being cut by the coral. , i ^ , ' On these oysters of the northern patch the merchants and petty traders declared they had lost money, as they did not yield pearl in tke same proportion as those on the southern part of the bank. The heavy loads were however chiefly fished from the northern patch. The oysters were all of the same brood and the same age as those on the south, and it is possible that the coral with which almost every oyster fished from the northern patch was covered had prevented their proper develop ment. The proportion of dead shells was the same on the north as on the south, and I believe that Government has just escaped a loss of revenue similar to that experienced in 1864, when the oysters, which it was anticipated in November, 1863, would afford a very fine fishery in 1864, died off or were destroyed before March, 1864. No. 7—A 0. [Extract from the Pearl Fishery Report of May, 1881.] There were nominally 47 days’ fishing, but only 44£ in reference to the number of boats which reached the bank and fished during the fishery and the daily advertised number. * The almost uninterrupted fishing with only the Sunday’s rest began, however, to tell on the divers towards the close of the fishery; and it was with some difficulty they were induced to go out during the last few days. It was stated to me that some of them were complaining of severe pain in the chest brought on by continuous diving ; and as the bank began to show signs of being fished out, and they experienced in consequence some difficulty in getting fair loads, many, as before remarked, did not care to go out. No. 7—A 1. [Extract from the Pearl Fishery Report of 1887.] The oysters on these banks were only three and a half years old, and it was estimated that they would yield fine fisheries in 1888 and in 1889, by which time they would have reached maturity. As the oysters were young, it was not considered necessary to inspect the banks in November last. During the inspection of March, however, it was found that the oysters on the Modragam bank and on the southern part of the west Cheval were dying out, and should, if possible, be fished at once. Captain Donnan estimated the number on the northern Modragam at 7,000,000. Arrangements were accordingly made for fishing these oysters in the usual way, although it was late in the season to give notice of and commence a fishery. Intimation was given bv telegram on the 18th and 19th Mat ch to the principal merchants and traders of South India who generallv come to the fisheries and to the divers of Kilakarai and Tuticorin that there would be a fishery. There is no doubt that if the Modragam oysters could have been left till next year they would have been very rich in pearl. The oysters of both the Modragam and Cheval, it must be borne in mind, were only three and a half years old and immature. The samples taken from them, though comparatively poor, were quite as good as could fairly be expected from oysters of that age. It is owing to the high prices at which pearls were selling after the fishery commenced that the prices of o\sters at the Government sales rose so much above the valuation of the samples. At the close of the fishery the merchants said that the Modragam oysters yielded more and finer pearls than the oysters of the Cheval. A peculiarity in the pearls of this year was the very large number of slate-coloured and brown pearls, commonly called “ black pearls,” amongst them. No. 7 .—A 2.

No. 7. —B. [Extract from the Pearl Fishery Report of May, 1888.] Amongst all classes of divers who came this year there was a large proportion of lads and young men. The Government of India are, I hear, carefully nursing their divers and training young lads in their chank fishery at Tuticorin, the proceeds of whicii, it is said, pays a large proportion of the charges incurred on account of inspecting and watching their pearl banks. I believe some such system might be adopted with much advantage here. No. 7.—C. [Extract from the Pearl Fishery Report of May, 1888.] I doubt if at any previous fishery so large a variety of pearl oysters has been seen at one time in the Government kottu, the whole Cheval bank having been several times represented : Oysters from the west Cheval, with the peculiar umbrella-like sponge on them, called “ Kudai Paar oysters.” Oysters from the north-west, with branch-coral growing on them, which were found on north Cheval, and which have apparently drifted from the north-west. Oysters from the south-west Cheval, like those fished during the early part of the fishery, and very like those on the Motorakam. Oysters from the central Cheval, a small thick oyster called “ Koddaipaku.” That the oysters of the several portions of the bank have their peculiarities in regard to size and shape was very fully proved on this occasion. I have heard it doubted if pearl oysters when mature vary much in size and shape. There was a very marked difference, for instance, in the size and shape of the oysters lifted this year from the south Cheval and drift and those lifted from and near the central Cheval. To show bow absurd some of the stories got up by the traders were, and how strangely reversed were the conditions on the bank after the inspection of November, I may mention that when on one day’s fishing (the 29th March) a large number of small oyscers had been brought in from the central part of east Cheval, they were eagerly purchased up by the traders, who stated that these oysters were the richest in pearl. It was on the central part of east Cheval that immature oysters were found in December, valued at only Rs. 6'514 per thousand, and it was that part of the bank which was to have been reserved to be fished in 1889. The immature oysters must have been clean swept off the bank and oysters from some other part of the Cheval carried on the central part of east Cheval. The so-called immature oysters which the traders complained of on the 1st and 2nd March were similar oysters, and as the fishery progressed they declared that the best oysters were those that were fished on the 1st and 2nd March and those which came off the drift patch. A merchant of some experience purchased a large quantity of oysters one day, because they were large and believed by him in consequence to be full of pearls. He found that the yield from them was no&amp; equal to that from the so-called small immature oysters—the small thick oysters called by the people “ Koddaipaku,” viz , the arecanut oyster. The Chetties of Ramnad and Madura went in largely for oysters this year ; and it was the competition brought about by them that tended in a great measure to keep prices up. These men came to Silavatturai in the early part of February, and the oysters of the fishing of February were mostly purchased by them. No. 7.—D. [Extract from Report on Fishery of 1888.] Oysters carried off the Banlc by Current and Flood. Some expression of opinion may perhaps be expected of me as to the cause of the sudden disappearance of so many oysters from the banks after the inspection of November, 1887. In regard to this, I have to submit that I still hold the opinion which is expressed in my reply to Captain Donnan’s telegram informing me of the disappearance of the oysters, viz., “ that I believe the heavv floods of December had a good deal to do with it; and the opinion I entertained has been strengthened by what has come under my observation during the fishery. The native( 60 ) idea is that heavy floods are injurious to the pearl oysters on the Ceylon banks, and this theory has certainly been borne out on one occasion to my knowledge, when the heavy floods of December, 1862, and January, 1868, were supposed to have caused the destruction of a large number of ojsters of the portion of the Cheval bank fished in. 1868. , ^ a..,a When the fishing commenced (in 1868) it was found that a large number of the ousters had^ died off, and that those left were dying off. the non close in shore tod's fathoms about 15 miles from the shore beyond the Periya Paar. I believe composed of masses of coral formed probably on a base of sandstone, or of a conglomerate composed of sand, shells, &amp;c., almost level with the sea bottom ; and of peculiar varieties and forms of detached coral which have been formed on the bank or have drifted on to it ; and of detached pieces of conglomerate of sand, shells, coral, &amp;c., all of which afford holding ground for the byssus of tho ovstoi* ^ To east and north-east of these banks three riversf discharge into the sea the drainage of a large area of country forming extensive portions of the Mannar, Anuradhapura, and Puttalam Districts. The ordinary discharge of fresh water by these rivers is supposed by some to be beneficial to the pearl oysters, and to account in some measure for the superiority of the oysters found on these banks in regard to yield and quality of pearls. This may probably be true and 1 be leve it to be true—to a certain extent, but I also believe that any very extraordinary discharge of fresh muddy river water, such as was experienced in 1862, 1863, and recently in December and January must have an injurious effect on the pearl oyster. ... nr When the inspection of November closed there had been a deficiency of ram in the Mannar District and in the Vanni. About the 14th December, however, heavy rain began to fall in the Mannar, Anuradhapura, and Vanni Districts, and for fifteen days there was almost incessant rain, the whole country was flooded, and for over three weeks the rivers ran in flood and discharged an enormous volume of water loaded with mud and other impurities into the sea in the neighbouihood of the pearl banks. It has been stated that the water discharged by these rivers could not possibly have reached the banks. I believe that it could, and I believe that it did. I have seen the sea discoloured fur three miles from the land during very ordinary freshes in the Aruvi-ar and have taken up fresh water from the surface. Tne abnormal flood discharge of over three weeks must have been cariied far out to sea and quite as far as the banks. # . When going from Mannar to Vavuniya-Vilankulam by the Mannar-Mad iwachchi road m December during the rains, I went down, accompanied by the Adigar of Musali on the 19th December, to the river (the Aruvi-ar) at Puliady Irakkam on the 23rd mile to see it when in flood, and I remarked that the flood might injure the oysters. The Adigar replied that it would very probably kill them out. He merely gave expression to the native idea on the subject. He himself seemed to doubt if the flood water could reach the banks. I expressed my fears regarding the effect of the flood on the banks on my return to Jaffna to those with whom 1 conversed regarding the prospects of the fisnery, and when I could get no information regarding the lifting of the samples in February I felt sure something had occurred, and was quite prepared, when Captain Donnan’s telegram came to learn that a large proportion of the oysters had been destroyed. I was astonished, however, to hear of the almost entire disappearance of the oysters. I thought that about one-third or half of the oysters might have been destroyed. That a very strong current set over the bank at almost the same time no one who has had any experience on the bank this year can doubt. Oysters, oyster-shells, and pieces of coral have been swept clean off the Cheval bank and carried from half to three miles from it from 6 and 7 fathoms into only 4^. It is very much to be regretted that no reliable information can be obtained as to when this current swept over the bank, its actual direction, and duration. The floods continued to the beginning of January of this year. The current, which apparently set over the banks in a south-easterly direccion, carried away, as I believe, the oysters disturbed and sickened by the flood, many of them very probably already dead. The flood would, I believe in any case, have destroyed many of the oysters. The current would no doubt have carried away a great many not attached to the firm rock but to the loose coral, some of which was also swept away; but I do not think that the flood without the current, or the current without the flood, would have caused the almost entire destruction of the large number of oysters found on the bank in November. In 1863 the shells of the oysters that had died off were picked up on the bank. No current had carried them away ! On this occasion the dead shells were found to the south-east of the bank up to three miles from it, having been carried off the bank by, there is no doubt, a strong current. We know when the floods occurred, but we have no reliable information as to when the cur rent swept over the bank. It is very probable both occurred at about the same time between the 10th and 30th December. There are circumstances however connected with the state of the oysters found on the drift, which may probably support a supposition that the current occurred in January and not long before Captain Dmman’s inspection of Februarj'—I allude to the state and condition of the oysters found on the drift patch as described by the divers. I doubt if oysters would have lived any length of time in the state and condition in which they were found. In any case there was no voluntary migration on the part of the oysters; they were swept almost clean off the bank and most of them were destroyed. The divers brought up 22,000,000, and they reported from 50 to 75 per cent, dead on the drift patch. They found dead shells wherever they fished, and from the appearance of many of the shells brought up it was evident that the oysters that remained were dying out. The state of the , , home people have thought -and some people may probably still think—that the pearl banks are large sandbanks about trom one to two miles from the land, dry at low water and that the oysters are collected by people who wade out to the bank at low water. 1 was toll by a person that this was his idea of the pearl banks until he visited Silavatturai. Others have.thought that the banks are formed by the deposits of river silt, f The Aruvi-ar, the Kallar. and the Modragam-ar.C 61 ) fo^lylngoVu^ which the oysters, dead shells, coral, &amp; c, were by a current—and a rather strong ctrent The Lster ‘n* ° Pi r n ‘^5 * he clri£t was cansed lying in small ridges on the ground, some buried in the sand On r’li'c ! .TT ,| : n ,: ^ deacri , bed a ®.

The shells picked up this year were not crunched up like those picked up in 1864. r ihere is^ abundant evidence, however, of a current having swept over the bank, and in the present imperfect state of our knowledge those who hold the opinion that the current, and the current alone, caused the destruction, have the evidence on their side. My own opinion is that flood and current acted together, or the latter immediately after the former, and caused the destruction ; and I am also of opinion that the current swept over the bank some time in January and not very long before the inspection of February. I have been asked how it was that the Modragam escaped. I do not believe that the Modragam did escape. I believe the oysters fished from the Modragam were mostly Cheval Paar oysters. Those on the north Modragam were exactly like those fished from the drift and south Cheval, and the boats found oysters on the ground between the Cheval and Modragam and drift and Modragam. The oysters found on the north-west corner of south Modragam on the 5th and 6 th April were no doubt drift oysters from the west Cheval. They had a peculiar slimy appearance, and were covered with sand when fished by the divers and brought into the kottu. I was told when I arrived in Silavatturai on the 20th February that the young oysters on the west Cheval had not been carried away or injured, and was asked how I accounted for this on the flood theory—how is it accounted for on the current theory ? I presume the current must have swept over them just as it did over the other parts of the bank. Appendix No. 8. IVo. 8.—A. The Hon. the Colonial Secretary to the Government Agent, Jaffna. No. 420. Colonial Secretary’s Office, Colombo, December 15, 1888. SIR,—In transmitting for your information an extract from a letter from the Inspector of Pearl Banks, I am directed to state that the Government Agent of the North-Western Province has been desired to communicate with you on the subject of the probable requirements in the way of buildings and accommodations for the proposed fishery at Dutch Bay, and I am to request you to render him every assistance in your power.

[Extract from Captain Donnan’s Fishery Inspection Report of November, 1888.] I returned to Silavatturai on the 26th November and began washing the Muttuvarattu Paar sample on the 27th, and on the 29th the pearls were valued by four pearl traders residing in Silayat- turai. The sample of 1A000 oysters turned out pearls weighing three kalangies and 10 T \ manjadies, valued at Rs. 122, equal to Rs. 10'16 per thousand oysters. The valuers said the peails though small are of very good quality. I enclose herewith the valuation statement. The low value of these oysters proves that they are rather young for fishing yet. Ihey would no doubt be vastly increased in value a year hence—that is to say, if they lived so long, which is somewhat doubtful. The bank is a new one, never fished before, and is exposed to currents ; there( 62 ) is now a large percentage of dead shells on it ; and the oysters appear of the same character as those that were on the Cheval Paar in 1884, which died off a year before they were mature for fishing I consider these oysters are now in a very precarious state, and for these reasons I recommend a fishery early next year, to commence if possible on the 1st February. 4 No. 8.—0. [Extract from the Pearl Fishery Report of 1889.] May 31, 1889. The number of oysters fished was 6,004,553 less than the estimate and the PJoceed s Rs 198 377-28 above the estimate. The expenses will amount to between Rs. 10,000 and Rs, 80,000. ' The divers stated that there were sufficient oysters left on the bank to afford another good fishery. In fact, they said that they had not fished half the oysters. however, I doubt. The oysters, it was said, were young and might have been left for another year, but the risk of leaving them was great, and it was deemed advisable to secure a fishery. As ai as I could judge, however, the oysters appeared to be in very good condition to be fished, and the prices realized seem to me to iDecH* this out. ■ ,, .•» yv • ^ * i q'tq The oysters were small thick oysters, somewhat like those on the Penya Paar fished m 1879, and on some parts of the Cheval called by the people the “ Kottaippakku Chippi, and generally supposed to be rich in pearls when mature. The samples were, in my opinion, very much undervalued. No. 8.—D. FExtract from the Pearl Fishery Report of 1890.] L May 12,1890. The number of oysters fished was 33,000,000, being 9,000,000 over the estimate. The oysters fished were very much mixed both in regard to size and quality, and this may account for the difference of value between the samples of November and February. The merchants complained to me when the fishery commenced that the oysters fished during the early part of the fishery were inferior to those fished at Dutch Bay, and asked if we were fishing the same bank as fished last year. On examination of some of the loads in the kottu, it appeared to me that there was some ground for the statements made by the merchants. There was no doubt a large number of small immature thin oysters with comparatively few pearls in them, and those small, but there was a very large proportion of fine fullgrown thick oysters of the best description, rich in pearls. It is, no doubt, owing to the large mixture of immature oysters that the prices did not go higher than they did as the fishery advanced, and when there was the usual number of merchants an( j Towards the close of the fishery there were unmistakable signs of the bank having been nearly fisbed out. Loads became gradually smaller and smaller, and the divers said that the oysters were Very much scattered, and that they experienced some difficulty in fishing them. One of the chief divers informed me, after the close of the fishery, that there were still some oysters remaining on the east of the bank, and some very good oysters on the west in 12 fathoms, which was however too great a depth for them to work in. No. 8.—E. [Extract from the Pearl Fishery Diary of 1890.] Marichchukkaddi, April 18, 1890. Captain Donnan came on shore in the afternoon. I mentioned to him what the Kilakarai diver told me yesterday regarding the oysters on the Muttuvarattu Paar and the depth of water on the west. Captain Donnan informed me that what the diver had said was perfectly true as regards the depth of water ; that there was a deep pit on the west ; and that he had been afraid to allow the Government divers to work close to it for fear of their slipping into it. No. 8.—F. [Extract from the Pearl Fishery Report of 1890.] This bank, never known to have been fished before 1889, has yielded a revenue almost equal to that derived from the Cheval Paar in 1857, 1858, and 1859, viz., Rs. 1,000,000 (one million), and equal to that derived from the Cheval Paar in 188U and 1881, viz., Rs. 800,000. The few oysters fished up from the Karativu bank were also very much mixed, a very large proportion being small and immature. The yield of pearl has been very good as regards weight and quality up to a certain size, viz., the fifty baskets. There were comparatively few large pearls found, and very few of the large-sized pearls were of good shape. The quantity of the smaller sizes made up for the deficiency in the larger, and the merchants and traders have all expressed themselves very well satisfied with the result of their speculations and have gone away quite contented.

The oysters were very much mixed some beinl ike those on the east, north, and south Cheval and the Modragam Paars, and others like the small thick oysters found on the Penya Paar called the “ Kottapaku’’-all rich in pearl. Amongst them were however some flat immature oysters with little in them. For the most part, however the oysters were full-grown mature oysters, rich in pearl. There can be no doubt from the state of a large proportion of the oysters brought into the kottu that they were dying out. On some days the oysters brought in had an offensive smell, and on examination of the heaps in the kottu I found many dead and putrid, the flesh falling out when the shells were opened. Some of the divers informed me that the oysters were dying out fast, and if not brought in quickly they would all die out, and that they were bringing up numbers of empty shells and oysters that had recently died. Of the actual state of the bank at the close of the fishery I cannot form a decided opinion. The loads gradually decreased towards the close of the fishery. Some of the divers informed me that the bank was nearly cleared out, and what oysters remained were scattered about in sma,ll heaps over the bank, and they experienced great difficulty in finding them, and were obliged to wander over the bank ; others told me that there were still some left on the north, west, and south. The small loads towards the close of the fishery were probably owing in a great measure to the exhausted condition of the divers and their inability to work properly towards the close. There can be no doubt, however, that the bank is nearly fished out. No. 8.—I 2. [Extract from Captain Steuart’s “ Account,” page 39.] These banks have been known from ancient times, but the people informed me that there are besides these banks two more valuable reefs opposite Calpentyn which have not as yet been discovered by any of our divers ; and they undertook to point them out at the ensuing inspection, provided Your Excellency would favour them with an opportunity to do so, which I promised should be given them, and I further told them that the employment was open to all, without respect of persons, on no other condition but fidelity, zeal, and ability. This assurance encouraged them in such a manner that they immediately told me that opposite to the flagstaff of Calpentyn, to the depth of 6 , 7, 8 , and 9 fathoms, was situated the bank Moetoewarettoe Paar, 9 miles in circum ference, and another also opposite Calpentyn, and close to the land Chinnemoetele Koelettoe Paar, to the depth of 4 ^ to 8 fathoms, six miles in circumference.

I believe that 2,500 will be nearer the number, occasion there was a large number of boys and young men being trained to be divers. On this Xo. 8—L. Arab Divers, Marichchukkadi Pukulum, 1891. The threatened invasion of Pukulum or Marichchukaddi early in February by, it is said about 2 000 Arab divers calls, I think, for some special notice—some record of the first appearance of Arab divers at Ceylon fisheries (at least at recent fisheries), and of the circumstances which rendered it necessarv to prevent their coming on this occasion—for had it not been checked it would mos probably have rendered a fishery impossible, or have brought it to a premature close, and wou nnv case have placed it entirely in the hands of a clique. ^ ^ , . Arabs may have come to ancient fisheries, but I have not seen any record of their having to any fisheries under the Dutch and British Governments. I am not aware of any record of Arabs Imviiig come to Ceylon fisheries before that of 1887. There were no Arabs at all in the previous fisheries between that of 1855 and 1&lt;S87. m In 1887 one Persian Gulf Arab employed in some work at Tuticorm came across to the fishery, another from Bombay brought an air pump and diving apparatus and tried to work m a boat by himself, but soon gave it up and worked with the other divers in the ordinary way. As doubts were entertained if divers enough could be obtained from the usual sources to fish up the large number of oysters estimated to be on the bank for the fishery of 1888, inquiries w made of these men and of one Mohamed Harries (a pearl merchant of Bombay who came to the s i i of 1887) if Arab divers could be obtained from Bombay. The Arab diver from Tuticorm said that many would come if notice were given to them, and Mohamed Harries told me that he cou c rjl § from 300 to 400 divers if required. He subsequently wrote to me from Bombay asking it e 8 0 bring them to the fishery of 1888. From the accounts 1 had received of the disposition of the Arabs I did not care to push the matter further, as I entertained great doubts as to the expediency o ge g any of these men over, and felt sure that if they came in any number the system of working fisheries would have to be altered, and that they would exercise a very demoralizing ettect on divers of Southern India, who had worked the Ceylon fisheries. x • i cqa In reference to the circumstances attending the fishery of 1888 and subsequent events in , it is a matter for congratulation that the Arab divers were not brought to the fishery °f 1888. During the fishery of 1888 one boat of Arab divers worked (there were in all about lb ot tnemj, some woolly-haired Zanzibar and Bussorah men, who had beenhorsekeepers to a celebrated fi^rse ea in Colombo then in jail. The others were straight-haired, light-coloured Arabs from the rersr Gulf. They worked well and gave no trouble. Again, at the fishery off Dutch Bay in 1889 a boat with Arab divers worked. Iwo ot tnese men had work at the previous fishery. Two or three of them were very sullen, ill-tempered, ui lent-looking men, but gave no trouble./ ( 65 ) , A Tuticorin fishery took place in the same year, anti in order to get divers enough to work it Oaptaiir Phipps, I am informed, wrote to Bombay for some Arab divers. A few, it is said came down and helped to work the fishery. In 1890 there were again fisheries in Ceylon and Tuticorin. Whether Arabs were sent for a^ain or came down on their own account attracted by the reports of those who came in 1889, I do not MrW, but 200 of them came down to the fishery of Tuticorin. From all accounts they behaved in a fvet is improper manner there, their lawless conduct seriously interfering with the fishery, which was apparently abruptly brought to a close on the 10th March, I do not know why. The Arabs then crossed over to Ceylon and came to Marichchukkaddi. Most of them were a dirty, thieving, bullying lot, setting all law and order at defiance. Fortunately there were but 200 of them, otherwise the consequences might have been serious, as it was not known that they were coming and no special preparations were made to deal with them. Sixteen of them, amongst whom was one who called himself “ a chief,” working in a Jaffna boat, deliberately opened oysters on the bank, and when brought to the ship behaved in a most disgraceful manner, the chief threatening to cut Captain Donnan’s throat and mine directly I went on shore. They were brought on shore, taken before the court next day, convicted, sentenced to six months’ rigorous imprisonment, and sent to Colombo. A day or two after a fight took place between some Tuticorin and Arab divers, in which the Arab divers got the worst of it; the Arabs having been aggressors were brought before the court and bound over to keep the peace, and I stopped the Arabs from going out to the bank for two or three days. Their thievish, bullying, and insubordinate conduct in the kottu when dividing their shares gave cause for much anxiety at first. Finding, however, that some of their number had been sent to jail, and feeling after the row with the Tuticorin divers that the people had learnt how to deal with them, those remaining came and begged to be allowed to fish again or to go away, and on promise of good behaviour were allowed to go to the bank, and behaved fairly well till the end of the fishery. There can be no doubt, however, that their lawless conduct at Tuticorin and during the early part of the fishery here has had a very demoralizing effect on the divers of Southern India with whom they were brought in contact. This year, even before the advertisement of the fishery was published, it was reported that 200 Arabs had arrived at Tuticorin with the intention of crossing over to Ceylon. Intimation of this was sent to Captain Donnan, who at once laid the matter before Government, protesting against the Arabs being allowed to come to the fishery. The matter was referred to me, and I also strongly opposed their being employed. Their number gradually increased to 1,000 and subsequently to nearly 2,000. On the representation of the Ceylon Government the Madras Government took steps to prevent the Arabs coming across. On this a deputation of so-called “ chiefs ” came across to communicate with the authorities in Colombo. Amongst them, disguised as a Sheik, was the man who threatened Captain Donnan and myself, and who, I am informed, is no Sheik at all, but the son of a Bombay shipowner. They offered to give security for good behaviour, and a Colombo merchant, I was told, offered to stand security for them. This I afterwards found to be true, as he (the merchant) came to the fishery and informed me that he had lost a large sum of money in consequence of their not being- allowed to come, as the Arabs had promised to give him the whole of their shares of one day’s fishing if he o-ot them over, and he tried to induce me to allow some of them to come, which I positively refused to do, and told him that if they came they would not be allowed to land. In the meantime the Arabs at Tuticorin were behaving in such a lawless manner that H.M.S. Tuiquoise was telegraphed for, and troops were sent down from Trichinopoly to keep order. Finding that they could not cross over from Tuticorin, 1,000 of them went to Kilakarai in hopes of inducing the Kilakarai divers to bring them over in their boats. Some of the leading Kilakarai men begged by telegraph to be allowed to bring them, but they were warned not to do so. Finding that the Kilakarai boatmen would not allow them to come in their boats, the Arabs threatened to burn their houses and loot the village. On the representation of the Kilakarai divers, troops and police were sent to Kilakarai to keep the Arabs in check, and then the Kilakarai divers came over to Cevlon It is said that the Arabs were ultimately removed m a B. I. steamer to Tuticorin, and thence with those remaining there to Bombay. A few managed ? to find their way over to Ceylon, but they all rAnvp^pnted that thev belonged to the “ British Circar. all represented f hat all the Arabs collected at Tuticorin were divers. I believe many of them were Bombay robbers and thieves, and were coming oyer here for the purpose of plunder. There can be no doubt that some people of Bombay, Kilakarai, and Colombo were very anxious to have them here in order to get the whole fishery into their own hands, as they knew well that the nresence ot such a body of rlfflans would have prevented many of the merchants who generally attend the fisheries coming. Moreover, had the Arabs been allowed to come special measures must have been taken at great expense to guard the bank, to regulate the fishing, to watch the boats when coming in, and to protect the camp and the neighbouring villages. , f , Now that the Arabs have found their way here they will very probably try *0 come to future fisheries A comparatively small number of them carefully selected, say about 200 to 300, under proper supervision and 1 control, would be of great service in a large fishery, as they are undoubtedly excellent divers • but there are a sufficient number of divers in Southern India to work a small fishery In any case precautions must be taken to prevent a disorderly lawless mob like that assembled at Tuticorin this year finding its way to a Ceylon fishery.
