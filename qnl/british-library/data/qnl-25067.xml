Confidential. lTo.2318 of 1909. British Residency and Consulate General, Bushire, 12th September 1909. From Major A. P. Trevor, First Assistant Resident, In charge of Residency. To S. H. Butler, Esquire, C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to the Resident’s letter No.2086, dated 21st August 1909 on the subject of a further shipment of oxide from Abu Musa by Messrs Wonckhaus and Company. Before writing his letter of the 14th August to the German Consul, Major Cox wrote to the Residency Agent telling him to inform Hassan bin Someiyeh that he could collect and ship oxide for the German Firm on condition that he gave an undertak ing in writing not to send any armed men to the island, nor to attempt to interfere with the mines, nor to take any oxide other than that left on the beach by the S.S. ”Louise” or the heaps takentaken out from the mine by himself and partners, in add Major Cox instructed Agha Bedr to state that Abdulla bin partners, in addition Hassan was only authorised to proceed to the island when the ship arrived, as before. During the first week of this month, Mr. Wassmuss called on me and introduced the subject of Abu Musa; he said that he heard that Agha Bedr had imposed conditions on the ions on the German smuss called Firm. I remarked that the conditions were imposed on Hassan Samaiyeh. Mr. Wassmuss said that the German Firm had no 1 objection to the conditions about no firearms being taken or to that specifying the oxide to be taken, but they were particularly anxious to send Abdulla bin Hassan Samair/eh to I could not admit that the matter was one in which Messrs Wonckhaus and Company had any right to intervene and that the conditions on Hassan Samaiyeh were imposed solely in order to prevent any regrettable incident with Sheikh Suggar 1 s people. Mr .Wassmuss then asked me to look up the conditions and see whether they were imposed by Major Cox. This I did and subsequently informed Mr. ?/assmuss in a private note that I saw no reason to alter the arrangements made by Major Cox. I now trouble Government with this letter as I think Mr. •-assmuss will complain to his Government about this natter. look after the mining. I informed Mr. 7/assmuss in reply that Therek — ■ : There is really no ground for doing so as Hamad Samaiyeh brother^ of Hassan is the man who always takes charge of the coolies and can do the work well. Abdulla on the other hand is an intriguer and mischief-maker. He is suspected by the Criminal Intelligence Department of smuggling arms into India, though unfortunately no proof can be obtained. He tried to get up a dispute when the S.S. 'Culistan” went to Abu Musa in June (vide my telegram Ho.672 dated 3rd July 1909.) He has also mixed himself up with politics etc. at Lingah to such an extent that we have seriously thought of taking steps to deport him but have refrained from doing so, as it would have looked bad while this case was going on. In the circumstances it seems &lt;^aite justifiable to prevent his going to Abu Musa except when the ship goes to load the oxide, and I do not think the Germans will be likely to press the point. It seems advisable, however, to lay the facts before Government in case the matter comes up. Mr. Y/assmuss informs me that Messrs Wonckhaus and Company wijfh to have 4-500 tons of oxide ready for a ship about the middle of October. This will entail coolies going to the Island about the 20th of this month. I have, etc., Sd. A. P.

On the 13th. ultimo, the day before this note was received, Herr von KShlmsnn, in the course of a conver sation at the Foreign Office, stated that the Oerman Government would be unable to come to a decision on this question until they had examined the correspond ence regarding the ownership of the island. Sir E. Grey ventures to point out that the under taking given to Count Mettemich in his note of July 28th. last was given on the understanding that the re ply of the German Government might he shortly expected, in accordance with a verbal statement made by Herr von Kuhlmann on June 16th, and that the declaration made by him on the 13th. ultimo introduces a new element into(35134/09) the situation, since, if the status quo were Indefinite ly prolonged, it is evident that British interests would be placed at a manifest disadvantage, for, where as His Majesty’s Government would have no right to touch any of the oxide in the island during the whole of that time, tessrs.Wonclchwis would be able, whenever it suited them, to remove portions of that already min ed on their account. In view of this consideration and of the fact that, since the date of Sir E.

S. £84 dated 14th July in connect ion with the Abu Susa correspondence, the Government of India instructed me that a pledge which had been asked for by the German Government was under consideration and that meanwhile it was in any case clear that the controversy had reached a stage which in practice made it advisable that no further mining operations should be embarked upon for the present. I now have the honour to report that on the )th instant the Acting tfice Consul for Germany informed me in conversation that Uessrs Wonckhau* wished to remove some ©ore of the accu mulated oxide down to the beach for shipment* II© could not then give me the name of the vessel or probable date of her arrival and thought the consignment might be for India only, by a vessel from India. He was inclined to demur a good deal to giving me precise information regarding the date of the arrival of the ship, arguing that there did not arpear to be any likelihood of difficulty on the island, so why could Hi ■Sir, open permission to send coolies to work notnot the chip cone and take the B tuff away when convenient. ’ 1 explained that I had been made responsible that there should be no contretemps on the island or obstruction to Messrs Wonck- haus-s operations for removing the accumulated material, and tha to this end X needed both to inform the Sheikh of the contem plated visit of a German ship and to give explicit instructions to the Residency Agent at Lingah, a0 that it was very necessary that 1 should be kept informed regarding the approximate time of the vessel’s arrival as X had been on the last occasion by his predecessor* We have since exchanged the communications of which I Consul-General to Acting German Consul” * dated 14th August 19^9* Acting German Consul to Consul General : dated 19th August 1909 . | Consul-General to Acting German Consul dated 21st August 1909.

'UQuisG*s” ohipmont in Hamburg and from the trend of Herr Was sinus s 1 o remarks during my conversation with him on the 9 th I am inclined to surmise that owing perhaps to some comment made by His Majesty*8 Government-. On the failure of Messrs WoncAhaus to take advantage of the arrangement made for him to fulfil the contracts which he claimed to have entered into, the German Government have pressed the firm to keep alive their active interest in the island. 4. I presume that the provisional instructions now issued by His Majesty*3 Government as to the suspension of mining operat ions are not intended to modify the standing instructions under wi^ich X am reouired to see that all reasonable facilities are accorded to Messrs Wonckhaus for removing the accumulated material and I have therefore continued to be guided by them, but should the pigBl pledge asked for by the German Government^entailing the cessation of mining operations, be ultimately given, then I venture to hope that it will be considered possible to close the island altogether to the oxide industry^after the present ship- ment^until this controversy is laid to rest. It would be difficult to make the Sheikh of Shargah and the otherother local elements interested understand the equity of an arrangement under which they themselves were not allowed to while mine or handle the oxide for their profit,^the German firm were permitted to remove and sell quantities of the accumulated mineral at their will, 5. Under ouch conditions it will be more than ever to the in terest of the German claimants to keep the controversy alive as long as there is any mined oxide left on the island. They can go on removing it at their leisure while the Sheikh of Shargali being meanwhile deprived of any profit from the Island will become dis contented and less tractable. Under the circumstances, would the Government of India see their way to advise, pending settlement of the dispute, the payment to the Sheikh of the amount of the rental realised by him before the cancellation of the lease? (6). Another point to which I beg to invite attention is as to whether it is necessary to consider how far the interests of Esa bin Abdul Latif in the profits accruing from the sale of the oxide mined before the date of his protest and before the cancellation of the lease, are entitled to be taken into account.

In the meantime they took note of the assurances offered by His Majesty's Government as to the maintenance of the statu s quo there. Herr von Kuhlmann added that Messrs Wonkhaus would continue to ship the oxide which had already been extracted from the mines but would cease mining operations pending a settlement of the question subject to the reservation of their rights to put forward any claims 1 he Under Secretary of State India Office.(31150/09). claims which might arise in connexion with the stoppage of their working of the mines. On the 14th instant Herr von Kuhlniann forwarded to this Office a note of which a translation is en closed herewith resuming the declarations which he had made the day before. I am to observe in this connexion that, as you were informed in my letter of the 21st. of June, Herr von Kuhlmann promised, on the 16th of that month, that His majesty 1 s Government should receive an answer to their note of July 10th, 1908 in about a fortnight, whereas they now state that, before reaching a decision they must examine the whole question of the ownership of Abu Musa. As the German Government have had the opportunity of undertaking this task at any time within the past year but have, apparently, not availed them selves of it, Sir E. Grey is disposed, with Viscount Morley's concurrence to inform them that the assurance given by His Majesty's Government that they would sus pend mining operations in Abu Musa pending a settlement(31190/09). of the dispute was offered on the understanding that the German answer was nearly ready and that His Majes ty*s Government cannot undertake to prolong the pre sent situation indefinitely.

I told him that I had certainly understood that the material for an answer was ready, and that the answer would be forthcoming very soon. All I meant in the memorandum was that we could not give an undertaking for an indefinite time, and that it was therefore given on the understanding that there would be as little delay as possible in continuing the negotiations, which were not to be hung up.

Late German Consul, who proceeded on leave 18th April, must have been well aware that operations were in progress, but took no exception to them. His successor has lodged official protest and demand for cessation of operations on the ground that claim of German firm is not limited to oxide previously mined, and that excavation or shipment of fresh oxide, is an encroachment on their rights.” Cox has replied that he is reporting to us for orders. As pointed out in India Office letter to Foreign Office, 3rd February 1909, memorandum to German Government, 10th July 1908, only undertook that Messrs. Wonckhaus should procure limited amount of oxide with a view to fulfilling existing contracts made before cancellation of lease. Present protest is, therefore, wholly unreasonable, and any abandonment of mining would operate as surrender of our whole case. We propose to instruct Cox to take no notice of German protest, and if approached again by German Consul, to point out limited character of undertaking to German Government in memorandum, and to draw attention to failure of Wonckhaus to take advantage of it.

In reply Sir E.

Grey stated that His Majesty's Government were prepared to use their good offices in order that temporary arrangements might he made whereby the firm of Wonckhaus would be enabled to procure a limited amount of red oxide to place them in a position to fulfil such contracts as they might have entered into before the cancellation of the lease but no under taking was given that the Sheikh would be advised not to allow mining operations at all at Abu Musa.

Please see Cox’s ^telegram 136 of 19th October forwarded with our Foreign Secretary’s Letter No. 43m, of 22nd October. Hassan has not commenced removing oxide, and German Consul has told Cox that though, since June, he has from time to time reminded Wonckhaus of obligation to give us notice, that firm has not moved. In statement of German case, stress was laid on loss to Wonkhaus owing to failure to supply oxide in accordance with terms of forward contracts. Firm’s inaction leads Cox to doubt whether forward contracts existed, especially as the Abu Musa oxide has no assured position in the trade. It is rumoured that the 400 tons shipped by the “Louise” are lying unsold at Hamburg. We have no recent information as to progress of negotiations with Germany, but it would seem desirable, if possible, to obtain from German Government definite information as to nature of alleged forward contracts and Wonchaus’ intentions as to further shipments unless there is ^jd^mand for oxide. It will be necessary to guarantee (Jesidenjfy agent’^Brown against loss if he is required to carry out further mining operations. Strick and Company’s local agent has apparently informed Cox that his firm will want 500 tons. Unless this be true, Cox recommends that fesidentjagent^Bro^^fshould postpone recommencement of mining operations until there is some demand for oxide. We are disposed to agree. x' Whole case is explained in Cox’s letter of 29th November forwarded with weekly letter of*24th December. * ,/X' &lt;UZj&lt;L L?&gt;o((o$ ^ / 1 \f ■ t r « s W Jo. ^ I \-'ip — 1 s ( Copy ) Telegram r.

Subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, we propose to inform Major Cox in reply to his letter— (i) that the arrangement, which he suggests, for the renewal of mining operations after the hot weather, is approved; (ii) that negotiations with Messrs. Strict or other firms for the under taking of a contract for the management of the mining and sales on behalf of the Sheikh of Shargah must be postponed until the questions at issue between the British and German Governments have been settled; (iii) that in the circumstances now explained it will be desirable to defer for the present the institution of suits by Esa bin Abdul Simla, the 23rd July 1908. enclosures). * No. 1822 A, [dated the 8th June 1908 (with consideration of His Majesty’s Govern ment, a letter* which we have receivedLatif and Nejef bin Ali against Hassan Samaiyeb, and that he may use his discretion as to advising Esa and Nejef to apply to Hassan for a statement of the accounts. 3.

Before leaving headquarters, I have the honour to bring the Abu Musa ques tion up to date, as to details with which this Residency is at present concerned. 2. I attach a copy of a letter which I have addressed to Dr. Listemann, which includes action on the instructions conveyed in Foreign Department telegram No. S.-352 of 4th instant. I have also spoken to my German colleague in the same sense, and shall do my best to see that the arrangements desired by His Majesty’s Government are carried out smoothly. 3. As regards the recommencement of mining operations. After another visit to the Island I have come to the conclusion that the existing heaps can be marked with whitewash and photographed if necessary, and that this having been done, mining might be renewed as soon as the hot weather is over. The newly mined mineral could be heaped on another side of the mine, and kept quite separate from the present heaps. 4. The Sheikh of Shargah, who has already been approached by two or three native applicants for a contract, has, without committing himself to any thing specific, authorised me to ascertain from Messrs. Strick or other British firm, the terms on which they would be prepared to take charge of the mining and selling operations on his behalf. These could best be ascertained by His Majesty’s Government in London. The simplest way should seem to be for the firm to take such a percentage on the sale price of the oxide delivered on board, as would cover their working expenses and give them a reasonable margin of profit. 5. The claims of Esa bin Abdul Latif and Nejef bin Ali against Hassan Samaiyeh. My primary object in advising that they should enter suits against Hassan was to obtain possession of Hassan’s account books before they were mani pulated. But before the reply of Government on that point was received, Mr. Brown had returned to Lingah and commenced sedulously preparing the accounts. On my last visit to Lingah (May 8th) Abdulla bin Hassan, who had before plead ed that they were scattered and not made up. smilingly, intimated that the account books were now “ quite ready ”, and I have no doubt they are. Esa bin Abdul Latif is an unsophisticated person, and his father, whom I con sulted, said that he was not capable of going to Bushire and prosecuting the suit against Hassan, who will no doubt be strongly supported and advised by Mr. Brown ; and on the other hand our Agent said he could ill afford to employ the expensive services of a Barrister from Bombay. Mr, Tigrane Malcolm of Bushire, to whom it was suggested that a power of attorney should be given to prosecute the suit for them, proves unwilling, on account of advancing age and other absorbing business, to take the matter up. It would obviously only weaken our position to allow the parties to institute the suits now and fail ignominiously, and I am therefore inclined to think, subject to hearing the views of Governments, that now that it has ceased to be of any advantage to obtain possession of the books, which have doubtless been manipu lated long ere this, it may be wiser to defer suing Hassan until after the present dispute is disposed of. Or, if preferable, Esa and Nejef might ask Hassan in a friendly way to give them a statement of the accounts, and then, if they are not satisfied with them, they can move us again. I shall be glad to be favoured with the views of Government on this point, as Esa and Nejef will be expecting to hear from me ©n the subject.No. 1822, dated the 8th June 1908. From—M ajor P. z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—M onsieur le Docteur H. Listeman, Consul Imperial d’Allemagne, Bushire. Before leaving for summer quarters, I have the honour to communicate to you one or two details regarding the Abu Musa question which has been un der correspondence between us. Shortly after addressing you my last communication on 2nd May 1908, No. 1312, I received instructions from my Government that I was to advise the Sheikh of Shargah to allow any oxide already mined and accumulated on the island to be removed by Messrs. Wonckhaus. In order not to lose time, I called at Lingah and saw Abdulla bin Hassan, and enquired from him whether, if permitted by Sheikh Sagar and desired by Messrs. Wonckhaus, he and his father were prepared to undertake the loading and shipment as before, and enquired how long he would require. He replied, after consulting Mr. Brown, that they estimated that there was 3,000 tons of marketable oxide accumulated, and that they would primd facie be ready to ship it; but explained that it would be impossible for coolies to work on the island for the next 3 or 4 months owing to the unbearable heat, and that further Mr. Brown had had no intimation of any wish of his principals to send another steamer at present. Under these circumstances I have the honour to request that you will be good enough to request Messrs. Wonckhaus to give me due notice when the firm wish to ship again, so that the necessary arrangements can be made as before. With regard to the loading gear and animals remaining on the island, I have to inform you that I visited the island after seeing the Sheikh of Shargah, and satisfied myself that all the gear left by Hassan Samaiyeh had been effectively built up in one of the mud godowns by Abdulla bin Hassan’s superintendence, and that donkeys on the island belonging to Hassan are thriving. The Sheikh of Shargah has appointed a caretaker, and I gave him due instructions in person. G. C. B. P., Simla.—No. €** 47 ,?. D.— 27 - 08 .— 44 —E. A. D'S. 43489. I. 1135. 2000.—6/1908.

[22073] No - 1 - Memorandum communicated to the German Ambassador. HIS Maiesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the situation which has arisen in connection with the export of red oxide from the Island of Abu Musa, and which formed the subject of a communication made by the German Ghai 0 d J Affaires on tbe 31st December, 1907. . n The subject is so intricate in nature that it proved necessary to tiammit a documents forwarded by the German Embassy to Die Government of India and to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. This officer lost no time m mstituti g the requisite inquiries, but, owing to the absence of telegraphic communication with Share ah, and the necessity of subjecting the several documents bearing on case to detailed examination, it has not been found possible to reply to tae commum c - tl0,1 ^eTetult of this examination tends clearly to establish that the statements of fact upon which the complaint of Messrs. Wonckhaus is based are inaccurate For convenience of exposition the substance of each particular, count of tl complaint is set forth under a separate heading and printed m italics ; the observations of His Majesty’s Government are subjoined in ordinary type. Copies of the documents referred to are annexed m the Appendix. 1 The mines on Abu Musa are owned by Salim-bin-Sultan, the uncle of the ruling Sheikh of Shafgah. They mere leased by Salim in 1898 to a Company for a fixed yearly rent. The Island of Abu Musa, with the mining and all other rights, is, and can be proved to be the property of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, Sheikh Sagartom^Khaled^ This is established by a letter dated the 21st February, 1908, in which Salim-bm-Sultan categorically disclaims all right of ownership, and declares that, m granting the, lease of 1898, he merely acted as^proxy for the ruling Sheikh, then a.bsent on ajilgrima^ to Mecca (see Appendix, No. 1). The two men were at one time at enmity, btoim having been the mling Sheikh till April 1883, when he was Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled, who has ever smee been the rulmg Sheikto ^ekt between them now depend on an Agreement concluded in 1889 (see Appencli No The ruling Sheikh has, ever since his uncle was deposed m April 1883, i n inffpv an allowance in which, solely in virtue of oral and personal arrange- ril a.—STM W- “'■*»’ “»'»» ( ~Xrs5ta“lS; resided err .he island ho hn. don. ” “V “ “fPSn' circumstance which is corroborated by two letters addiessed in 1884 by - &amp; qi ivu in flip British Resident in the Persian Gulf (see Appendix, ims. 3 and 4). S The Island of Abu Musa is shown by its history, as recorded in the accompanying nr a /coa Annpnriix No 6) to be an integral part of the dominions of the ^r. I- regularly in. hi. orvn lire ..eel there for purples ^ 8 ^“^ galim did not conclude the-lease of 1898 in the capacity of owner but in that of Regent, a contention which is farther supported by a lettei, dated ’the 11th October, 1902, from the ruling Sheikh to the British Resident (see Appendix, No. 7). 2 The lease of the Company appears to be legally constituted; this was recognized the ruling Sheikh of Shargah , sincehimself was, for a time, a partner m the Company. The use of the word “ lease” rather obscures the true nature of the rights granted to the pai-tners by the document of 1898 (see Appendix, No. 9). The document was [1852 /c—1]O' not an absolute grant to the partners of the right to mine oxide on the island for an undetermined period. It was a mere permit to the partners terminable on either side at any time. That the partners were entitled to terminate the Concession is shown by the words, “ for such a period as they may wish to hold them,” but the only effect of these words is to give the partners the right to surrender the mines and escape from the liability to pay 250 dollars a-year when they please. They do not imply that the right to terminate the contract is with the partners alone, and that the owner is bound for ever, and can under no circumstances escape from the contract, however valuable the mines may become. That the lessor retained the right to determine contracts of this character is shown by the penultimate paragraph of the document: &lt;£ I have perhaps made out certain Agreements previous to this. They do not hold good, and this Agreement is to be acted on.” In these circumstances the lease appears to have been no more than a permit to work these mines, determinable by notice on either side, the owners receivino- 250 dollars a-year so long as it was in force. The action of the ruling Sheikh in becoming a partner in the concern for a few months in 1899 cannot affect his right to cancel the lease granted in his behalf, no matter what complexion the Company might in future assume. Were there any question at issue as to the genuineness of the lease granted in 1898 by Salim, the tact that the Sheikh had subsequently become a partner would be of importance, but as he approved the lease no such question arises, and his temporary partnership is an incident Having no direct bearing upon the points at issue. 3. In October 1907 Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, one of the original lessors, sold his share in the Company to the British subject Thomas Brown, of Lingah, who, a few days iatei, transferred the share to the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah. The Company of lessors now apparently consists of three British subjects and the German firm R. nonckhaus and Co It appears that an absolutely legitimate commercial business is concerned. r a lebruary, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 8 ), the ruling Sheikh °p iar o aa . ac ^ ress G ( f a ^^^tmication to TIassan Samaiyeh withdrawing the document o oncession and informing him that, the contract of 1898 being terminated, he had no onger any right of enjoyment in regard to the mines on Abu Musa. In these circumstances, Messrs. Wonckhaus, if they purchased without notice of the fact that the Concession had been terminated, have been misled either by Hassan Samaiyeh or by the intermediate vendor, Mr. Brown ; in either case, their appropriate remedy would appear to be an action at law against the vendor for damages. n + 'u’i Wi \ en tllo y P urciiase d the share in the Concession, they were already aware that it had come to an end, they have no cause for complaint at the action of the * p ^ 1 eitllGr 111 terminating the Concession or in enforcing his action by the removal ™ k° m the w lai \ d ; f01 ' the y bou ^t with lull knowledge of the position. • , * Messr ®' Wonckhaus and Co. do not appear to have any locus standi m ™ eir capacity as partners to question the Sheikh’s action. 4 ' In - 1 ? 07 f 6 . 8heikh , sent armtd men t0 the island, who expelled the miners ZaL Iff i ,T l T ,-T f- The b0atS With the Sheikh ' s armed ™re towed LiftenrJZah- the BnHsh man-of-war 'Lapwing,'’ on board of which is said to have been Lieutenant Gabriel, British Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas. ihe Sheikh had recourse to forcible measures within his own jurisdiction in wirKeA W ^ tCnt r 1 USal f Hassan Samai y eh t0 desist ’ “ accordance v.itn the Sheikh s lepeated injunctions, from working the mines. in the Persi^ P Cnlf 0 L 0 J f ^ was jn contemplation, and the British Eesident nruden^that 1 oup^nf ^ ckl1 / of . t ie Sheikh’s intention, it was considered p.udent that one of His Majesty s ships, with a British Consular officer on board should accompany the armed force to the island, in order to prevent the use of andlosfoMiffi 0 ! 61106 ' ^ TT 0Wi “ S to Ulis Precaution 1 that all bloodshed to • ,i - f ‘ Prevented.

By the forcible measures and illegal conduct of the Sheikh of Shargah the Company have been prevented from enjoying the lease granted to them by the proprietor of the mines. The rights of the Sheikh of Shargah in regard to the disposal^of his own property are absolute, since, apart from such general control as, in virtue of Treaty relations, is exercised by the Government of India, he is subject to no external control, and is bound only by such laws as he himself may decree. In the case of the particular lease or permit in question, it has already been shown that the Sheikh was entitled to determine it at his discretion. In no sense of the word does the conduct of the Sheikh appear to have been illegal. 6 . The Company is thereby suffering losses, since they have entered into contracts to deliver fixed quantities of iron oxide at a fixed price. In particular, the managing partner has entered into a contract dated the June, 1906, the German merchant Herr Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah (partner in the above-mentioned firm U. Wbnckhaus and Co.), to deliver certain fixed quantities for four years. There is nothing in the documents in the possession of His Majesty’s Government to indicate that Hassan Samaiyeh occupied the post of managing partner, and for reasons which will appear more fully below' there seems every reason to believe that Hassan Samaiyeh had no right as against his partners to enter into any such contract without their knowledge, and that, had they been aware of its terms, they would have refused their consent. It is clear that when the document was disclosed and the terms of the contract became known to the other partners they declined to approve it. The abrogation of the lease or permit has certainly rendered it impossible for either the Company in wdiose name Hassan contracted, or for Hassan himselt, to carry out the contract. His Majesty’s Government are not fully aware ol the relations between Hassan and the firm of K Wonckhaus and Co., but they recognize that it is possible that Hassan’s action in making a contract which he was unable to fulfil may have rendered him liable to Messrs. Wonckhaus in substantial damages. This, however, is a matter between Mbssrs. 'W onckhaus and Hassan. 7. The information in the possession of the German Government leads them to certain conclusions in regard to the motives of the Sheikh of Shaigah. These motives may conveniently be discussed under two headings, (a) the objections of Esabin-Abdul Latif, one of the partners _ m tlie f . orm ^ to work the Concession granted in 1898, and (b) the objections of the Sheikh himself, to the terms of a certain contract entered into by the aforesaid Hassan Samaiyeh vit Herr Hobert Wonckhaus on the 1st June, 1906. . ^ ^ mi By this contract (see Appendix, No. 10) Hassan Samaiyen, ndio is described as “owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,” gives “ the entire monopoly of Bu Musa oxide to Bobert Wonckhaus during the terms ot the contract (savm 0 certain small amounts duly specified)and, on the expiry of the contract, reserves to Robert Wonckhaus the preferential right of renewal. With regard to point (a), the German Government state It does not appear to be the case that the contract was concluded without the agreement of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, as the managing partner, Hassan Samaiyeh, immediately on the conclusion of the contract informed Esa’s father, Abdul Latf, who represented Ins son in all matters pertaining to the Company, and Abdul Latif approved the m reply According to a later letter of the father, the son appears to recognize the contract as legally valid, although he would have liked to have seen before Us conclusion as he describes its abrogation simply as '‘preferable, and in subsequent letter the gather says definitely that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son. The documents referred to in the foregoing statement form Inclosures 6 , 8 , and 10 in the note from the German Embassy, but the translations of these document s in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (see Appendices, Nos. 12, 16, and 17) diffd materially from those forwarded by the German Embassy, and further letters of considerable importance are omitted from the German case The 1st June, 1906, was the date of execution of the deed of contract between Somaiveh and Mr. Bobert Wonckhaus. When, on the 11th June 1906 (see Appendix', No. 11), Hassan Samaiyeh reported the Agreement to Esa’s father.4 Abdul Latif, lie concealed the existence of what was virtually a monopoly and of the preferential right of renewal. In his reply, dated the 14th June (see Appendix, No. 12), Abdul Latif comments upon the transaction in guarded language, and expressly requests Hassan Samaiyeh to ff refrain from entering upon any arrange ments whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract, from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels.” On the 26th June, 1906, Mr. T. Malcolm, a British-protected subject, with whom the concessionnaires had engagements, requested Hassan Samaiyeh to furnish him with a copy of the Agreement, inquiring whether other European firms could enter into similar contracts. Both points were evaded by Hassan Samaiyeh in his reply of the 13th July (see Appendix, No. 13), in which he alleged that the original contract had been drawn up in German; and in a further letter of the 14th October (see Appendix, No. 14) to Mr. Malcolm he refused to send a copy of the Agreement, and said that secrecy of the transaction had been enjoined by Herr Bobert V/onckhaus. It was not until the 16th December, 1906 (see Appendix, No. 15), that he sent a copy of it to Abdul Latif, who, on receipt of the document, wrote on the 23rd January, 190*7 (see Appendix, No. 16), to Hassan Samaiyeh stating that his son Esa did not agree to the execution of such an Agreement, which had been concluded without any consultation among the partners, such as should undoubtedly have taken place. The phrase which, in Inclosure 8 of the German case, is translated “ the cessation of this contract would be preferable to its continuance ” is more accurately rendered by £&lt; the nullification of this contract is better than its acceptance.” This employment of the comparative is, in Arabic epistolary form, a customary euphemistic manner of expressing a definite resolution. In the present case this interpretation is confirmed by the whole tenor of the letter in question. It does not appear, as contended in the German case, that Abdul Latif definitely says in his letter of the 27th March, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 17), that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son Esa. It is clear that the main ground of Esa-bin-Abdul Latif’s objection to the contract was that Hassan Samaiyeh, improperly describing himself in inaccurate terms as “ owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,” had, without consulting his partners, formed a contract with Herr 'Wonckhaus which tied the hands of the Company, not improbably for an indefinite period, in regard to practically the whole amount of red oxide excavated at the island, and bound them to sell it at a fixed price, so that they would derive no advantage from any increase in the price of oxide. It is obvious that a contract of such far-reaching import should, before being concluded, have been submitted to all the parties interested. Esa-bin-Abdul Latif has expressly denied that he gave any power of attorney to Hassan Samaiyeh, and maintains that it was incumbent upon the latter to act in regard to every trans action in communication with him, according as was agreed in the deed drawn up on the admission of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh to partnership in the Company (see Inclosure 2 in the note from the German Embassy). If the contract had in reality been submitted to and approved by Abdul Latif on behalf of his son Esa, it is difficult to see the reason for which Herr Wonckhaus enjoined secrecy on Hassan Samaiyeh (see Appendix, No. 14). As will be seen from the accompanying Petition (see Appendix, No. 18) from Nejef,^ the son and heir of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, now deceased, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif is not the only partner in the Company who takes exception to the proceedings of Hassan Samaiyeh. Xlis Majesty’s Government understand that the dragoman of the German Consulate, Bushire, has been in communication with Nejef-bin-Nakhoda in regard to his attitude towards the contract of the 1 st June, 1906. With regard to ( 6 ) (the objections of the Sheikh of Shargah himself to the contract of the 1 st June, 1906), the German Government are of opinion that— T//e Sheikh .s fear that he might lose possession of the mines and island is senseless, while the fact that there was no provision in the lease of 1898 allowing the whole export of the mines to he transferred to a foreigner without the Sheikh's approval is no more con clusive ^ thaii' the emission of a prohibition against such a transfer, and, in view of the i ecognized liberty of trade in the Persian Gulf, it is to be inferred that the conclusion of contracts with foreigners was within the powers of the Company. The principal motive of the Sheikh of Shargah in cancelling, in accordance with the exercise of his sovereign rights of jurisdiction, the lease granted in his behalf bythe Regent in 1898 was evidently a proper and natural desire to administer justice as between the partners of the Company, and to render nugatory the unauthorized action of Hassan Samaiyeh. Moreover, on learning how far the terms of the contract with Herr R. Wonckhaus went, conferring as they did a preferential right of renewal for an indefinite period, the Sheikh may well have felt that his own pecuniary interest in the mines would not, in view of the increasing market value of red oxide, he properly safeguarded by a payment limited indefinitely to a sum of 250 dollars a-year. In these circumstances the Sheikh would not unnaturally have deemed it advisable to protest against the contract with Herr Wonckhaus so soon as he became aware of its purport, rather than to allow this gentleman to acquire, with the lapse of time, a vested interest in the output of the mines. The position at the present time appears to His Majesty’s Government to be that Herr Robert Wonckhaus has entered into a contract with Hassan Samaiyeh, who, having acted without authority from his partners, is unable to carry out his contract, and is consequently liable to Herr Wonckhaus in damages. If, therefore, further steps are taken they should be of a legal character, and it will be at the discretion of Herr Wonckhaus whether they are taken or not. His Majesty’s Government appreciate the friendly manner in which the German Government' have dealt with the case, and, pending a final decision of the whole question, they are prepared to use their good offices in order that temporary arrange ments may be made whereby Messrs. Wonckhaus will be enabled to procure a limited amount of red oxide to place them in a position to fulfil such contracts as they may have entered into before the cancellation of the lease. Instructions have accordingly been issued to the Rritish Resident in the Rersian Gulf to ask the local representative of Messrs. Wonckhaus to give due notice when the firm intend to resume operations in order that the necessary arrangements may be made. His Majesty’s Government are, however, informed that, for climatic reasons, no serious operations are possible during the next three or four months for transpoi Ling the accumulated minerals from inland to the beach.

I WRITE to inform your honour that whereas I have come to know that Haji Hassan-hin-Ali Samayieh and the friends who advise him assert that the oxide mines which are in the Island of Abu Musa are my personal property, and that the lease which was issued by me to Haji Hassan and his partners was given by me in my own right, and not by proxy, in your behalf.

Such are the facts of the matter, and I have recorded them for your information. (Signature and seal of Sheikh Sagar-bin-lOialid-bin-Sultan.) No. 6 . Memorandum shmving the connection of the Jowasim Clan, the Ruling Chief of Shargah, and Sheikh Salini-bin-Sultan, respectively, with Abu Musa Island, as indicated by the Archives of the Bushire Residency. More than a century and a-half ago the Chiefs of the Jowasim Clan of Arabs, at that time paramount in authority on what was known as the “pirate coast ” of Oman, with head-quarters at Bas-el-Khaima and Shargah, crossed over to the Persian Coast with their war craft and captured the port of Lingah and other places on the coast. There they remained in occupation for upwards of a century, one of the ruling family from Bas-el-Khaima, acting as Chief of the branch of the tribe which remained on the Persian Coast; having its seat of Government at Lingah, but remaining subject to the overlordship of the ruling Chief of the head-quarters of the tribe, then at Bas-el-Khaima. At that time as now practically all the islands in the Gulf were permanently or at certain seasons tenanted by Arabs tribes ; and several of them, including Abu Musa, by the Jowasim. In the pearling season the tribal fishing-boats^ would have 'recourse to these islands for water or for refuge from stress of weather; in the spring, after rain, the various Sheikhs would send their horses and flocks for grazing, and^ in the winter parties of their subjects habitually sojourned in the islands for fishing purposes. Time went on and the sections of the Jowasim on the Persian Coast after some generations became as it were permanent settlers there and quarrels began to arise between parties of them and their kinsmen from Oman sojourning on the islands, when their grazing interests clashed. In order to put an end to this recurrent friction the Chiefs of the Clan came to a friendly understanding under which particular islands were henceforth to be used exclusively by different portions of the tribe. Under this understanding Abu Musa fell to the Shargah branch, and the arrangement then made has never been disturbed. While not ordinarily intervening in the internal politics of the Jowasim or other Arab tribes in Treaty relations with them, the British authorities have in practice recognized this position, and, in pursuance of their time honoured policy of maintaining the “maritime truce,” the principles of which, as we have specifically notified to the tribes, are held to apply to the islands of the Gulf as well as its waters, we have interfered in the present instance in so far as that when alien tribesmen from Debai and elsewhere have attempted to send their flocks for grazing, or otherwise to meddle with Abu Musa Sir Bu Nuair Islands, they have been directed either to desist or first obtain the acquiescence of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah in their proceedings. It is true that on one or two occasions the Persian Government, apparently trom ignorance or misconception of the history of these islands generally, have attempted to insinuate a claim to Abu Musa, but in 1888, wdien this claim was first assei ted, in conjunction with a similar one in connection with Sirri, Colonel E. C. Boss,^ for eighteen years Besident in the Persian Gulf, writing to Sir Henry Drummond Tv olff. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, on the 28th April, 1888, observed: “ The claim now put forward to the Island of Abu Musa has no justification whatever and any attempt to assert Persian authority there in a practical form would lead to disturbance . 5 5 Again in April 1904 when an over zealous Belgian Customs official proceeded^ to the island and incontinently hauled down the Shargah flag and hoisted the Persian emblem in its place, the Persian Government v T as called upon to lepair the unwarranted affront, and a British man-of-war was sent to see that it had been done and that the Arab flag was replaced with due ceremony. Thus, as far as the Jowasim are concerned the position which existed from time immemorial has been maintainec up to the present moment, and every year in the spring, when and after lain has fallen and vegetation made its appearance, the ruling Sheikh of Shargah and his immediate relations have been in the habit of sending their live-stock to graze on the island. [1852 k—Vi D10 So much for the abstract history of Abu Musa as an appanage of Shargah. We may now turn to the aspects brought into relief by the present misunderstanding in connection with the grant of a Concession for mining oxide on the island. In the year 1883, the ruling Chief of Shargah was Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan. He had held the reins of tribal Government for about eighteen years, but his regime was a weak and unpopular one. This Sheikh had taken a particular and enterprising interest in Abu Musa and had planted some date groves and built himself a rough residence there. In the spring of 1883 he was according to his habit spending a few weeks there with the tribal horses and flocks and had left his nephew, Sagar-bin-Khalid, a young man of about 25 years of age, in charge of his head-quarters at Shargah. Among these Arab Chieftains the principle of “ might is right ” prevails, and Sagar-bin-Khalid, finding that the majority of the tribesmen of the principality were tired of his uncle’s rule, and ready to support himself in a coup d’etat, seized the government and proclaimed himself Sheikh on the 4th April, 1883, informing the Resident of his action. The British authorities leave these questions of personnel to the wall of the tribes concerned, and usually do no more than recognize the individual whom the support and choice of the tribe puts in a position to handle the reins of government; and in this case Sheikh Sagar received recognition in due course. As soon as he had made sure of his position he addressed the Resident (on the 17th May, 1883) saying that he now proposed to expel Sheihh Salim from Abu Musa. In reply he was reminded that the Residency had in former years specifically notified to the Trucial Chiefs that the principles of the maritime truce must be held to apply to the islands as well as the seas of the Persian Gulf, and that he should consequently endeavour to arrange a peaceable settlement with his uncle. Simultaneously Sheikh Salim left Abu Musa for Lingah, and thence vu*ote to the Resident asking his good offices. He in turn was advised to remain in Lingah (it being more convenient for purposes of communication) until he could come to an understanding wdth Sheikh Sagar. Being in the weaker position Salim soon came to terms and a settlement guaranteed by the Sheikhs of Ras-el-Khaima and Debai was arrived at in July 1883, under which Sheikh Salim was to receive a pension of 600 dollars per annum for his maintenance. A copy of the settlement is attached. Sheikh Salim, however, found it difficult to refrain from intriguing against his nephew, in the hope, no doubt, of getting back the Sheikhdom. 3 ° Thus, on the 21 st January, 1884, Sheikh Sagar complained to the Resident of his uncle s conduct, and in the course of his letter he wrote:— “At present you are aware that Salim resides on Bu Musa, which is an island dependent on Shargah, and 1 cannot, spare it to others, and perhaps Salim may create some disturbance which may break the maritime peace. I beg, therefore that vou fill kmd l/ warn Sa l im and inform him that if he is desirous of living at Abu Musa he must do so peaceably, you being his guarantee that nothing wrong will be done bv him of a nature to disturb the maritime peace. But should he not^choose to obev it will be your choice either to remove him from the island or to leave us to «ettle 'the matter between us, and in that case we should not be called to account in the event of our attacking one another. I leave the matter to your disposition ” In reply the Sheikh was informed that if cither party broke the maritime peace lie would be promptly repressed. 1 thl % tl ^ e M 1 ! 6 o h r ik , hs ?f ^as-el-Khaima and Debai also complained to the b themtelves 11 ^ blieikh SallmS Ylolatlon of the Agreement, guaranteed as it had been On the 14th Eebruary following Sheikh Sagar again wrote to the Resident politely urging that it was all very well for him to say that whoever broke the maritime peace, would be repressed, but reminding him that Abu Musa was his— Sheikh Sagar s property—a hereditary appanage of Shargah. He added : thei S • lnd guarantees that he will not commit anything which vould mteifere with my affairs, or disturb the maritime peace, so be it; but I cannot dispense with this island, which is of the greatest use to me. I be 0, theie- ageiit^ ^ 1 ^ WlU plainly wnte to me 011 the subject, and likewise instruct yourOn this letter was recorded an office note to the following effect:— “ Sheikh Sasrar seems to insist that if Salim continues to live on Bn Musa he O should give a guarantee through the Resident that he will not do anything to disturb hum, Sheikh Sagar, or the maritime peace.” On the 5th April Sheikh Sagar wrote the Resident another letter pressing for a reply to the above. He added that he had communicated his precise object in writing to the Residency Agent, who would explain it. This was that now that spring had arrived he wished to send his horses as usual for grazing, and was not sure whether Sheikh Salim would leave them and their caretakers in peace. If the Resident would not allow him to make his own arrangements for ensuring safety of life and property on the island he wanted an assurance from the Residency that his stud would not be molested by Sheikh Salim. Sheikh Salim, however, who was now getting into financial straits, solved the difficulty himself. He made an appeal to the Residency alleging that Sheikh Sagar and the guarantors of the Agreement of 1883 had not stood by the terms of it; that they had taken away the State horses which as Sheikh of Shargah he had with him on the island when his nephew ousted him from the Sheikhdom, that he, Sheikh Salim, had had to sell all he possessed to maintain himself and now had nothing left, and that he had now come to beg his nephew to provide him with the wherewithal for a bare living. He declared that if he got this he would remain in peace and quietude. Finally he begged our Agent to intercede for him, and to induce Sheikh Sagar to act up to the Agreement. By the advice of the Residency Agent, Sheikh Sagar, who had found the 600 dollars somewhat too much for his purse, consented to pay his uncle a reduced allowance of 400 dollars annually, half of which only was to be paid in cash and the other half in grain and other articles. He also promised to assign to Sheikh Salim the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, which contained some salt deposits and was expected to bring in about 200 dollars more. A document in the above sense was drawn up at a meeting at Ajman and there ratified. When reporting the conclusion of this Agreement the Residency Agent mentioned that Sheikh Salim was at present going on a visit to Ras-el-Khaima and that his family would spend the hot ■weather there and the winter on Abu Musa. Things went on smoothly after this for a time, but the two Sheikhs eventually got at loggerheads again and in April 1889 our Agent reported that Salim had endeavoured to raise an attack on Shargah. On getting wind of his uncle’s intentions Sheikh Sagar, as usual, asked the advice of the British Agent and the latter soon succeeded in bringing about a friendly meeting between the two resulting in the framing of a third Agreement in supercession of the preceding ones. This was to the following effect; Sheikh Sagar bound himself to pay his now aged uncle the 400 dollar pension regularly and to permit him to return to the mainland of Oman and to live where he pleased within certain limits. He also offered to take Sheikh Salim into his service as Vizier or chief adviser and to consult him in all matters affecting the interests of the State. Sheikh Salim in turn under took to serve his nephew in obedience and loyalty. No mention was made of Sir Bu Nuair in this Agreement because it had hitherto disappointed previous expectations and had not brought in anything. The above has held good and no further documentary agreement has since been necessary. On the conclusion of it Sheikh Salim came to live in Shargah as his nephew’s adviser and for some years past the two have been the best of friend's, so much so that when Sheikh Sagar leaves his head-quarters, which he not infrequently does, he always leaves his uncle to officiate in the Government of Shargah, as he did, for instance, on his departure for the Mecca pilgrimage in 1897-8. It was on return from the said pilgrimage in 1898 that his uncle informed him of the grant of the Abu Musa Oxide Concession; when, in view of the fact that since the reduction of his pension from 600 to 400 dollars, Sheikh Salim had always been complaining of the paucity of his income. Sheikh Sagar as an act of generosity decided to let his uncle enjoy the 250 dollars annual rent fixed for the Concession and thereby cease to have cause for further discontent. From first to last, however, Sheikh Sugar’s acquiescence in his uncle’s enjoyment of the produce and income of the island in question, has been purely a personal and verbal arrangement which Sheikh Sagar might, at any time, have terminated had he chosen to do so. No deed whatever, according to the statements of the two Sheikhs themselves, has ever been given by Sheikh Sagar to his uncle in regard to this island.12 although the Island of Sir Abu Nuair did find mention in the second Agreement as above mentioned, dropping out again in the third and last because it had never brouo'ht in any income. 3 Stronger proof of the status of the island could hardly be wanted than the declarations furnished by the two Sheikhs themselves.

With regard to Abu Musa, my uncle Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan cultivates in that island, and in the year in which I went on the Hajj, my aforesaid uncle was acting as my regent ( kaim muqam ) in Shargah, and he saw fit to lease the mines of Abu Musa to Hassan-bin-Samayieh, a British subject, and Abdallah-bin-Hassan and Esa-bin- Abdul Latif, and the lease has remained up to now.

SALEM-BIN-SULTAN. No. 10. * Contract between Mr . Hassan C. Semey, Lingah, owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession, and Mr. Robert Wonckhaus, Lingah. . Hassan C. Semey agrees to deliver to Mr. Robert Wonckhaus, Lingah, during 4 years (four years) beginning with 1 st June, 1906, every year 2,000 to 5,000 tons of 20 cwts. oxide of iron of the Island Bu Musa, same quality as the 700 tons shipped by Mr. Robert Wonckhaus in March 1906. Mr. Robert Wonckhaus agrees to take at least every yeaa* 2,000 tons, and if he wants so and there is sufficient good stuff on the island of which he approves up to 5,000 tons yearly. The price is fixed at 15s. Qd. (fifteen shillings and six pence) per ton of 20 cwts., usual weight conditions, freight and charge free on board steamer Bu Musa, to be weighed on board. Hassan C. Semey gives the entire monopoly of Bu Musa oxide to Robert Wonckhaus during the terms of the contract; he is not allowed to sell or dispose of otherwise any quantity of Bu Musa during the term of this contract, but it is agreed upon that Hassan is permitted to export to India for his account during this year what he has sold already to India, and which he gives as 700 tons (seven hundred) and besides that every year from 1907 about 5—6,000 bags of 1 cwt. (four thousand to five thousand). Hassan Semey has to deliver daily alongside if in hags 200 tons or in bulk 150 tons, weather permitting. Payment for every lot which is to be shipped, half the amount when the lot is ordered, and the other half when the lot is being shipped. Advance to be paid by Mr. Robert Wonckhaus to Hassan 2,000 rupees (two thousand) whenever Hassan calls for it and receipt to be taken for it. This advance to remain with Hassan until the end of this contract. Whenever this contract comes to an. end, Mr. Robert Wonckhaus has the preference for a new contract of Bu Musa contract if he desires so, at same price and conditions or at any rate at the price of other serious buyer.

I had previously sent you a letter via Debai. I trust it has duly reached you. As regards the agreement which we have made with Wonckhaus, the G-erman, for the sale of red oxide, I have to tell you that we settled with him that 2,000 tons should be shipped every year, and that if we got out more than that he would be a taker of it. I have settled the price with him at 15s. per ton, and we have to bear [1582 h —Ij Emmmmmmmmrnmim. 14 all the expenses and deliver the oxide on hoard the steamers. Praise be to God, this is a godsend, and will make up for the past. The arrangement will continue for four years, and I have taken from him an advance of 2,000 ^ rupees. He has made conditions with us for the shipment of 200 or 150 tons per diem. The work begins from the 1 st June, 1006, and I have written to my son Abdullah to settle his affairs (in India), at any rate, and to come and supervise the work. I have sent labourers to the island, and we shall have in any case to buy more donkeys for transportation. I hope that, once begun, the work will go on regularly. No. 12.

I have received your former and later favours and was glad to hear of your welfare. As to your remarks on the subject of the red oxide in regard to which God decreed that you sold it to the German Wonckhaus at 155. per ton, and whereas it was arranged that you should excavate 2,000 tons per annum, all the charges to be defrayed by you, and he to receive the oxide nett. Very good; I hope it is auspicious. It will he good fortune after trouble. In any case, our brother Abdullah must reach there to supervise the work, because I think the operations cannot be regulated without him. Please, however, refrain from entering upon any arrange ments whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels which will lead to complaints and claims, because this will be difficult for our over-lords and they will not consent to it; and you are by God’s grace wise and will not commit any negligence or hesitation likely to entangle you, because in these days everyone is making a trap with which to entangle people. I hope you will not be neglectful in this regard. At any rate I am glad to hear this news, if we are safe from this world’s tricks more than before. No. 13. Nassau Samayieh to Mr. T. Malcolm. (After compliments.) Lingah, July 13, 1906. I have received your esteemed letter dated the 26th June and perused it gladly and understood what you had stated. You had acknowledged receipt of my letter the contents of which you had understood. As regards the sale to the German, it is satisfactory, and I hope it will be fortunate. You had understood the details regarding the sale, shipment, and boat- hire, but you did not let me know about the commission; is it to be charged by us from them or by them from us ? You had written that I should send you a copy of the agreement. Very well, but the agreement has been written in German, and there is no one with us who can write such a hand. The purport of the agreement is accurately the same as I have written to you. You had written to me whether we had contracted with the German for 2,000 tons per annum. Yes, we have contracted with him that the quantity should be 2,000 tons at least, and he can, according to the agreement take any more quantities which we may be able to obtain from the mines. You had written whether we can obtain more than this quantity, and if so, whether we can contract with other Europeans, so that you may negotiate with them. I have understood this, but I cannot give the accurate quantity unless the mine is worked for two or three months when I will be able to form an idea. I dispatched forty-five workmen to the island in the beginning of June, but little work is done, it being summer and the days being hot. If more than 2,000 tons are obtained, the German is bound to take it from us. We can therefore make no other contract. • c K - f t I1 beg also to inform you that my son Abdulla has sold about 400 tons more or less at Calcutta. Only the freight is to be paid by us, every maund will be 1 r. 9 a. delivery at Calcutta. I have been trying to procure a vessel since a long time. I have now-a-days chartered “ Alimghir,” the vessel belonging to the sons of Khoja (to ship red oxide) at 10 rupees per ton. It is now several days that she has gone to the island to ship (the oxide). Thank God my son Abdulla has freed himself from the dispute at Calcutta. He has compromised with them. He has come to Bombay, and I will receive his letter from Bombay by this mail, if God pleases. I hope he will not be detained there, and that he will settle his case with Jeita Bania and come to our parts soon. No. 14. Hassan Samayieh to Mr. T. Malcolm. (Translation.) Lingah, 23rd Shaban, 1324 {October 14, 1906). I have received your letter dated the 20th December, 1906, and was glad to hear of your well-being. I have understood what you stated. Regarding my son Abdulla, I beg to say that after settling the case at Calcutta he has arrived at Bombay, where he has some easy matters to settle with the Bania. He will settle his account and will leave for our parts in two or one and a-balf months. You had remarked that you had asked some one in the post-office to take from me a copy of the document, which is in German. Let it not be hidden from you that the German, when the bargain was concluded with him, said to me that this transaction should be kept secret (“ Yekoon Mastoor ”), and so I did not wish that any outsider should come to know of it, and I fear that if news of the copying of the document reaches his ears he will be annoyed. In truth, it is not my intention that anyone should come to know about it except myself and you. What you wanted, namely, the details of the sale which had taken place, I have already communicated to you in a previous letter. Procedure will be according to that letter, neither more nor less, in pursuance of what is written in the document. No. 15. Hassan Samayieh to Abdul Latif. (After compliments.) Lingah, 2 f lth Shawwal, 1324 {December 16, 1906). I wrote to you previously. I hope the letter reached you, and that you are well. Now I forward, inclosed in this letter, a copy of the Agreement regarding the sale of oxide to Wonckhaus, a copy made according to the original. Please acknow ledge receipt. Our news is quiet. I have nothing deserving of mention except to say all well. Inshallah, in these days we expect Abdullah to arrive Bombay in safety, and on his arrival I will apprise you. No. 16. Abdul Latif to Hassan Samayieh. [Inclosure 8 of German Case.] (After compliments.) &amp;th Zilhijjah, 1324 {January 23, 1907). I have received your esteemed letter and understood what you stated. I have understood the copy of the Agreement concluded by you with the German for the sale of the Abu Musa red oxide. My son Esa does not agree to the execution of an Agreement to this effect, and you had neither consulted with, nor referred to him, nor did you send him a copy of the Agreement before the settlement with the German of the affair concerning the red oxide, so that views might be exchanged between you both, and that you might adopt a recognized, obvious, and evident course, because it is obligatory for the partners not to undertake a matter except after a general consensus of views, [1852 /c—1] Fso that no difficulties may occur, and you have undertaken this affair without any consultation. Therefore, my son Esa does not agree to the Agreement concluded between you and the German, because he fears difficulty will result from foreigners concerning themselves in the matter. The nullification of this Agreement is better than its acceptance. You had previously received a letter (from me) saying that you should not involve yourself into difficulties with the German in regard to the red oxide, because he (Esa) fears an untoward result. I communicate to you what my son Esa says. No. 17. Abdul Latif to Hassan Samayieh. [Inclosure 10 of German Case.] (After compliments.) 12th Safar, 1325 {March 27, 1907). Your esteemed letter has reached me in due course, and I have noted its contents. When your communication reached me saying that you had sold to the German before mentioned oxide from Ahu Musa, every year 2,000 tons of oxide at 15s. per ton, I sent you hack an answer, dated the 21st Eabi II, 1321, which purported to convey acquiescence, but in the course of the same letter I cautioned you against entering into any agreement in the nature of a leasehold or into any relation likely to result in dispute, on the grounds that the overlords of our affairs would not agree to it. I asked you to give us immunity against the complications of the world (time). My letter in question is no doubt with you. Since writing it I have never received from you the copy of the deed of agreement existing between you and the German until the 5th Zilkaadeh, 1324, when it came in English after I had asked you for it time after time. I mentioned its arrival to you in my letter of the 6 th Zilkaadeh, 1324. And when we got a translator and translated the English document, it became plain to us that you had launched yourself into the very thing against which we had cautioned you and had tied yourself up by giving a lease. Consequently, my son Esa does not agree to this document which does not leave you any power of control or modification in regard to the oxide mines of Ahu Musa. And previous to this present communication I communicated to you in my letter dated 8 th Zilhijjeh a translation of the deed for your information and said that you would perceive that the question was not one of mere sale as stated by you, hut one of leasehold, against which I had warned you. Moreover, Sheikh Sagar does not agree to the lease of the oxide to outsiders from foreign Powers and claims that the agreement (with him) was that you should do the work yourselves and not farm it out. This is what had to be explained. ■* No. 18. Hough purport of a Petition from Nejef-bin-Ali, Persian subject, of Bunder Abbas, to Lieutenant Gabriel, dated February 16, 1908. (After compliments.) My father for some years performed service for the British, and as Haji Hassan- bin-Ali Samayieh, of Lingah, is a British subject, I therefore petition to you as follows :— Concerning the Abu Musa oxide, for which there were four concessionnaires, among whom I hold the deed of partnership of my father. My father had no other heir but myself, and therefore after his death Haji Hassan-bin-Ali acknowledged my right of partnership as acquired through my father. At the time when Hassan entered into the agreement with Messrs. Wbnckhaus he gave me no information what ever on the subject. Subsequently I made an arrangement with Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar to sell him oxide and sent word to ilassan to this effect. Hassan then wrote me that he had made a contract elsewhere, and would inform me regarding it later. As proof that I did not in any way agree to this contract made by Hassan, I point to the fact that it did not bear my signature, and when, some months later, Abdullah-bin-Hassan„wW.. _ .. . n K. 1 (7) and the German Munshi came and asked me to sign it in token of assent, I refused to do so, as I had not been consulted in the first place. As further proof of my right in the Concession, I may mention that in 1904 Abdullah-bin-Hassan had a case in Calcutta against Messrs. Sassoon concerning the Abu Musa oxide, hut seeing that the oxide had been sold in the name of my father, the case could not be proceeded with until I had furnished a power of attorney for the Calcutta Court—a copy of this is doubtless on your Consulate records. (Note by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul: The Consulate fee-book shows that Nejef paid 55 . fees for the execution of a power of attorney on the 29th October, 1904.) Now I complain that from the time that Hassan has been actively engaged in the oxide work of Bu Musa, I have not received 1 dinar of the proceeds, although all the work on the island formerly devolved upon my father, who himself found the implements, &amp;c., for working the oxide, which implements are even now at the island. Besides all this, there were 250 carpets which belonged to my father, and which were sent to Calcutta for sale. Abdullah-bin-Hassan wanted to settle up the account for them in Calcutta, but until I gave a power of attorney they would not settle with him. Hassan subsequently collected all the money, hut I have never been able to recover any of it from him. Now I pray you of your goodness to look after my rights and to obtain me justice ‘ 1 against Hassan. f\ ■&gt; !\U [21658] No. 1. Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co.—(Communicated by Mr. Wilson Fox, June 22.) Dear Sirs, Bushire, May 30, 1908. ON the 26th instant the writer was requested to meet the Resident, who again referred to the Abu Musa affairs at some length. Briefly the position is as follows :— That the Government has decided to allow the Germans to ship all the oxide which has been ymt out by Sumaya, and that the Germans are delaying the shipment of the balance now at Abu Musa, under the pretext of their inability to do so on account of the prevailing hot months, which render the working of coolies and lighters on the island a matter of physical impossibility, and therefore the lifting of the ore will have to be put back for about six months. There are, the Resident said, several lots of oxide on the island mined by Sumaya for the Germans, estimated at about 3,000 tons, and of this quantity certain lots have been rejected as inferior stuff by the Germans and the rest have been approved of, and these will be shipped. (Between us, as report goes, pressure must have been brought to bear by the German Government for the shipment of the balance now at Abu Musa, as the authorities originally intended to debar them from doing so.) The lots of oxide have been photographed. The Resident then asked the writer to inform you that the Government was willing to allow you to negotiate through the writer with the Sheikh for the working of the mines, and that the Resident was anxious that mining operations should commence immediately as weather permitted, so that you might be able to ship oxide in about six months’ time. The writer told the Resident that you were not now keen on taking up the Abu Musa business, and that we were consequently unable to move in the matter without reference to you. This was a matter of surprise for Major Cox, who understood from the Foreign Office that you were still eager to obtain the Concession of the mines at Abu Musa. Writer reiterated his previous statement, when Major Cox replied that there were other applicants in England anxious to take up the business, but that he would like to give you the preference, specially as we, as your agents, would be better able to treat with the Sheikh, and that he would afford us every facility in concluding a contract with the Sheikh. He further said that he would write to the Foreign Office to communicate with you. It is now for you to decide whether you authorize us to treat with the Sheikh, in which case you should send us your full instructions or let the matter pass you altogether. Perhaps it would be false modesty not to say that others are likely to seek our assistance, whether in India or England. We asked you some time ago to let us know the quality of the oxide shipped by “Louise.” Kindly enlighten us on the matter. There are certain important new features connected with Hormuz, about which we shall write you next week. Yours faithfully, (Signed) A. and T. J.

With reference to the telegram sent to the Government of India on the 2nd ultimo, I am directed by Secretary Sir E.

Sir E.

Gray presents Ms compliments to the Ger man Ambassador and, with reference to + ha anqui-y mada by His Excellency on the 1st instant respecting the export of rad oxide from the island of Abu Musa, has the honour to state that the British Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed on ApMl 9th to make arrangements for transporting all the oxide already mined to the shore, in order that it might be ready for shipment by ..iess^s. Woenckhaus. Major Cox reported early in May + hat ha under stood from Hassan Samaiyeh, who had been in consulta tion with Mr. Brown, that Messrs. Woenckhaus had no intention to make any further shipments for the nextfev months; and ha addad that, owing to the season of the yaar, no serious transport operations on the island were possible for two or three months. There remain on the beach some 400 tons of oxide and according to the estimate of Hassan S; maiyeh, about 3,000 tons of saleable quality near the mine. Thesve amounts are at the disposal of Messrs. Woenck- haus, and Sir E. Grey is disposed to think that it might he advisable for the local agent of the firm *o give the British Resident timely notice of any fur- j &gt; tiler shipments, in order that arrangements may be / concerted with the Sheikh of Shargah for preventing disturbances on the spot. A detailed statement in regard to the whole question of the oxide mines on Abu Musa will be com municatedC\ ( 22964). MEMORANDUM. &amp;L [b*0 i«^f M £cuj. X% Sir Edward Grey was good enough to say in his memorandum of January 10th that His Majesty's Govern ment did not see any objection to Mr. Wonckhaus remov ing the rad oxide which had already been drawn and which was ready for shipment from the island of Abu Musa, and that His Majesty's Government would advise the Sheikh of Shargah not to disturb the shipment. Reports received at Berlin state that only part of the oxide could as yet be removed, as the German Ship ■Louise' 1 which visited the Island in April last. had only room for 1810 tons. The quantity has been removed without disturb ance from the Sheikh's men. But the following quantities of oxide drawn and ready for shipment held to be left on the Island. (a) about 400 tons left from the oxide on the beach, from which the 1810 tons have been shipped, (b) a somewhat large quantity in the inner is- L land /■'•Iisland etonad up near the pit where it has been won. From correspondence that took place on the 18th and 21st of March last between the German Consul and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire it appears that the British Consul-General saw at that time some objection in advising the Sheikh to allow the removal of the oxide mentioned under (b). Major Cox promised to ask His Majesty's Govern ment for further instructions. July 1st 1908.I) R A F T.

May 1908. fm 1908 -J ( $dAi~rt'oi§ : CONFIDENTIAL. rs Memorandum for communication to the German Ambassador. HIS Majesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the situation which has arisen in connection with the export of red oxide from, the Island of Abu Musa, and which formed the subject of a communication made by the German Charge d’Affaires on the 31st December, 1907. The subject is so intricate in- nature that it proved necessary to transmit all the documents forwarded by the German Embassy to the Government of India and to the British Besident in the Persian Gulf. This officer lost no time in instituting the requisite inquiries, but, owing to the absence of telegraphic communication with Shargah, and the necessity of subjecting the several documents bearing on the case to detailed examination, it has not been found possible to reply to the communication in question at an earlier date. The result of this examination tends clearly to establish that the statements of fact upon which the complaint of Messrs. Wonckhaus is based are inaccurate. For convenience of exposition the substance ot each particular count of this complaint is set forth under a separate heading and printed in italics ; the observations of His Majesty’s Govern ment are subjoined in ordinary type. Copies of the documents referred to are an nexed in the Appendix. 11 bn* 1. The mines on Abu Musa are owned by Salim- bin-Sultan, the uncle of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah. They were leased by Salim in 1898 to a Company for a fixed yearly rent. The Island of Ahu Musa, with the mining and other rig! [565] undoubtedly to he the ■property of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled. ( fe^ktt^dated the 21 stFeb~ ruary, 1908^Sa3imXin^SuItaS^ategorically dis claims all right of ownership, and ^ declares that, in granting the lease of 1898, he merely acted as proxy for the ruling Sheikh, then absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca (see Appendix, No. 1). The two men were at one time at enmity, Sali m having been the ruling Sheikh/and h aving hee 1 ^ deposed by his nephew^Relations between them' now depend on an Agreement concluded m 1889 , 1 ’and it supports the genuineness_ oL this, declaration] (see Appendix, No. 2). The ruling Sheikh has, ever since his uncle was deposed in April 1883, made the latter an allowance, m which, solely in virtue of oral and personal arrangements, the revenue of the island, to gether with that of the mines, has been included (see Appendix, No 5). When Salim .has resided on the island, he has done so only on sufferance, a circumstance which is corroborated by two letters addressed in 1884 by the ruling Sheikh to the British Besident in the Persian Gulf (see Appendix, Nos. 3 and 4)^ The Island of Abu Musa is shown by its history, as recorded in the accompanying Memo randum (see Appendix, No. 6), to be an integral part of the dominions of the Sheikh of Shargah, who in recent years has not infrccpicntly sent his own live stock there for purposes of grazing. It thus appears that Salim did not conclude the lease of 1898 in the capacity of owner, but in that of .Regent, a contention which is further supported by a letter, dated the 11th Octobei, 1902, ^rom the ruling Sheikh to the British Besident. 2. The lease of the Company appears to he' legally constituted; this was recognized by the ruling Sheikh of Shargah, since he himself was, for a time, a partner in the Company. (iff (zzs, A A/ ' ^ h* s/a. ^ ciatt _ c-A fc*, At** trp tt Stjo &amp; ■ tx*. ^ fO coyS) r / erf- )'C c -t /)* '€*' »’ - f (Cj J'e^vJcx^Z^ 2 2 of F ■ O * The use of the word “ lease ” rather obscures the true nature of the rights granted to the partners by the document of 1898 (see Appendix, No. 8). The document was not an absolute grant to the partners of the right to mine oxide on th6 island for an undetermined period. It was a mere permit to the partners terminable on either side at any time.That the partners were entitled to terminate file Concession is shown by the words, “ for such ^ a period as they may wish to hold them,” butjSheso^e^c^j ' &lt; words\do not imply that the right to terminate the contract is with the partners alone, and that the owner is bound for ever, and can under no circumstances escape from the contract, however valuable the mines may become tiioiii only offoet TsTcTgive the partners the right to surrender tlie'\ mines and escape from the liability to pay 250 dollars a-year u r hen they please. ^ That the lessor retained the right to determine contracts of this character is shown by the penultimate paragraph of the document: “ I have perhaps made out certain Agreements previous to this. They do not hold good, and this Agreement is to be acted on. 55 In these circumstances the lease appears to have been no more than a permit to work these mines, determinable by notice on either side, the owners receiving 250 dollars a-year so long as it was in force. The action of the ruling Sheikh in becoming a partner in the concern for a few months in 1899 cannot affect his right to cancel the lease granted in his behalf, no matter what complexion the Company might in future assume. Were there any question at issue as to the genuineness of the lease granted in 1898 by Salim, the fact that the Sheikh had subsequently become a partner would be of importance, but as he approved the lease no such question arises, and his temporary partnership^ appears—as anr—aeoidontal ovontr having no direct bearing upon the points at issue. 3. In October 1907 Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, one of the original lessors, sold his share in the Company to the British subject Thomas Brown, of Lingah, who, a few days later, transferred the share to the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co., of Lingah. The Company of lessors now apparently consists of three British subjects and the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co It appears that an absolutely legitimate commercial business is concerned. In a letter dated the 21st February, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 7), the ruling Sheikh of SLargali addressed a communication to Hassan Samaiyeh withdrawing the document of concession and4 , the contract of 1898 M- terminated, H^ooan Samaiyoh hnyi^fno longer^ any right of enjoyment in regard to the mines on Abu Musa. In these circumstances, Messrs. Wonckhaus, if they purchased without notice of the fact that the Concession had been terminated, have been misled either by Hassan Samaiyeh or by the intermediate vendor, Mr. Brown ; in eithei case, their appropriate remedy would appear to be an action at law against the vendor for damages. If, when they purchased the share in the Concession, they were already aware that it had come to an end, they have no cause for com plaint at the action of the Sheikh either in terminating the Concession or in enforcing his action by the removal of the workmen from the island, for they bought with lull knowledge of the position. In either event, Messrs. Wonck haus and Co. do not appear to have any locus standi in their capacity as partners to question the Sheikh’s action. 4. In October 1907 the Sheikh sent armed men to the island, who expelled the miners and prevented the mines being worked. The boats with the Sheikh’s armed men were towed to Abu Musa by the Hritish man-of-war “Lapwing,' on board of which is said to have been Lieutenant Gabriel, British Vice-Consul at Bunder Abbas. The Sheikh had recourse to forcible measures within his own jurisdiction in consequence of the persistent refusal of Hassan Samaiyeh to desist, in accordance with the Sheikh’s repeated injunctions, from working the mines. As the expulsion of British subjects was in contemplation, and the British Resident in the Persian Gulf had been duly notified of the Sheikh’s intention, it was considered prudent that one of His Majesty’s ships, with a British Consular officer on board, should accompany the armed force to the island, in order to prevent the use of unnecessary violence. It was probably owing to this precaution that all bloodshed and loss of life were prevented. The Sheikh’s boats were towed to the island in order to insure their simultaneous arrival with His Majesty’s ship “Lapwing,” and to enable the British officers to control the action of the Sheikh’s retainers more effectively.5. By the forcible measures and illegal conduct of the Sheikh of Shargah the Company have been pre vented from enjoying the lease granted to them by the proprietor of the mines. The rights of the Sheikh of Shargah in regard to the disposal of his own property are absolute, since, apart from such general control as, in virtue of Treaty relations, is exercised by the Government of India, he is subject to no external control, and is bound only by such laws as he himself may decree. In the case of the particular lease or permit in questioa, it has already been shown that the Sheikh was entitled to determine it at his dis cretion. In no sense of the word does the conduct of the Sheikh appear to have been illegal. 6. The Company is thereby suffering losses, since they have entered into contracts to deliver fixed quantities of iron oxide at a fixed price. In particu lar, the managing partner has entered into a contract dated the 1st June, 1906, with the German merchant Herr Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah {partner in the above-mentioned firm R. Wonckhaus and Co.), to deliver certain fixed quantities for four years. There is nothing in the documents in the possession of His Majesty’s Government to indi cate that Hassan Samaiyeh occupied the post of managing partner, and for reasons which w T ill appear more fully below there seems every reason to believe that TIassan Samaiyeh had no right as against his partners to enter into any such contract without their knowledge, and that, had they been aware of its terms, they would have refused their consent. It is clear that when the document was disclosed and the terms of the contract became known to the other partners they declined to approve it. The abrogation of the lease or permit has certainly rendered*'!! impossible for either the Company in whose name Ilassan contracted, or for Hassan himself, to carry out the contract. His Majesty’s Government are not fully aware of the relations between Hassan an^the firm of It. Wonckhaus and Co., hut they that it is that Hassan s action in making a contract which he was unable to fulfil may have [565] 0rendered him liable to Messrs. Wonckhaus in substantial damages. This, however, is a matter between Messrs. Wonckhaus and Hassan. 7. The information in the possession of the German Government leads them to certain conclusions in regard to the motives of the Sheikh of Shaigah. These motives may conveniently be discussed under two headings, {a) the objections of Esa- bin-Abdul Latif, one of the partners in the Company formed to work the Concession granted in 1898, and (h) the objections of the Sheikh himself, to the terms of a certain contract entered into by the aforesaid Hassan Samaiyeh with Herr Hobert Wonckhaus on the 1st June, 1906. By this contract (see Appendix, Ho. 9) Hassan Samaiyeh, who is described as ‘‘owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,” gives “the entire monopoly of Bu Musa oxide to Bobert Wonckhaus during the terms of the contract ” (saving certain small amounts duly specified), and, on the expiry of the contract, reserves to Eobert Wonckhaus the preferential right of renewal. With regard to point (a), the German Govern ment state:— It does not appear to be the case that the contract was co 7 icluded without the agreement of Esa-bin- Abdul Latif, as the managing partner, Hassan Samaiyeh, immediately on the conclusion of the contract informed Esu’s father, Abdul Latif, who represented his son in all matters pertaining to the Company, and Abdul Latif approved the contract in his reply. According to a later letter of the father, the son appears to recognize the contract as legally valid, although he would have liked to have seen it before its conclusion, as he describes its abrogation simply as “preferable,” and in a subsequent letter the father says definitely that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son. ^The documents referred form Inclosures 6, 8, and 10 in the note from the German Embassy^- translations of theSfc documents in the possession of His Majesty’s Government^differ materially from those forwarded by the German Embassy, and further letters of considerable importance are omitted from the German case. The 1st June, 1906, was the date of execution of the deed of contract between Hassan Samaiyeh and Mr. Bobert Wonckhaus. When, on thellth June, 1906 (see Appendix, No. 10), Hassan Samaiyeh reported the Agreement to Esa’s father, Abdul Latif, he concealed the existence of what w r as virtually a monopoly and of the preferential right of renewal. In his reply, dated the 14th June (see Appendix, No. 11), Abdul Latif com ments upon the transaction in guarded language, and expressly requests Hassan Samaiyeh to &lt;c refrain from entering upon any arrangements whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract, from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels. 5 ’ On the 26th June, 1906, Mr. T. Malcolm, a British-protected subject, with whom the con- cessionnaires had engagements, requested Hassan Samaiyeh to furnish him with a copy of the Agreement, inquiring whether other European firms could enter into similar contracts. Both points were evaded by Hassan Samaiyeh in his reply of the 13th July (see Appendix, No. 12), in wdiich he alleged that the original contiact hal been drawn up in German; and in a further letter of the 14th October (see Appendix, No. 13) to Mr. Malcolm he refused to send a copy of the Agreement, and said that secrecy of the transac tion had been enjoined by Herr Bobert Wonck- li on a T+ nnf nnti‘1 thfi 16th December 19C6 (see Appendix, No. 14), that he sent a copy of it to Abdul Latif, who, on receipt of the document, wrote on the 23rd January, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 15), to Hassan Samaiyeh stating that his son Esa did not agree to the execution of such an Agreement, which had been concluded without any consultation among the partners, such as should undoubtedly have taken place. The phrase which, in Inclosure 8 of the German case, is translated “ the cessation of this contract would be preferable to its continuance 55 is more accurately rendered by c ‘ the nullification of this contract is better than its acceptance. This employment of the comparative is, in (customary manner of expressing a definite reso lution. In the present case this interpretation is confirmed by the whole tenor of the letter in question. It does not appear, as contended in the German case, that Abdul Latif definitely says in his letter of the 27th March, 1907 (see Appendix, No. 16), that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son Esa. It is clear that the main ground of Esa-bin-bbbbbhssssbhhHB B Abdul Latif’s objection to tbe c ontract w asjhat . Hassan Samaiyeh, obnomo^/d^ribing himself in inaccurate terms as “ owner and holder of Bu Musa Concession,” had, without consulting his partners, formed a contract with Herr Wo nek- haus which tied the hands of the Company, not improbably for an indefinite period, in regard to practically the whole amount of red oxide excavated at the island, and bound them to sell it at a fixed price, so that they would derive no advantage from any increase in the price of oxide. It is obvious that a contract of such far- reaching import should, before being concluded, have been submitted to all the parties interested. Esa-bin-Abdul Latif has expressly denied that he gave any power of attorney to Hassan Samaiyeh, and maintains that it was incumbent upon the latter to act in regard to every transaction in communication with him, according as was agreed in the deed drawn up on the admission of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh-to partnership in the Company (see Inclosure 2 in the note from the German Embassy). If the contract had in reality been submitted to and approved by Abdul Latif on behalf of his son Esa, it is difficult to see the reason for which Herr Wonckhaus enjoined secrecy on Hassan Samaiyeh (see Appendix, No. 13). As will be seen from the accompanying Petition (see Appendix, No. 17) from Nejef, the son and heir of Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, now deceased, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif is not the only partner in the Company who takes exception to the proceedings of Hassan Samaiych. His Majesty’s Government understand that the f German authorities havejbeen in communication with Nejef-bin-Nakhoda in regard to his attitude towards the contract of the 1st June, 1906. With regard to (6) (the objections of the Sheikh of Shargah himself to the contract of the 1st June, 1906), the German Government are of opinion that— The Sheikh's fear that he might lose possession of the mines and island is senseless, while the fact that there was no provision in the lease of 1898 allowing the whole export of the mines to he transferred to a foreigner without the Sheikh's approval is no more conclusive than the omission of a prohibition against such a transfer, and, in view of the recognized liberty of trade in the Persian Gulf, it is to be inferred that &gt; fixe ri^ CL.&lt;J&amp;-rrx. CC-yl __4 9 the conclusion of contracts with foreigners was within the powers of the Company, 'f'j The principal motive of the Sheikh of Shargah in cancelling, in accordance with the exercise of his sovereign rights of jurisdiction, the lease granted in his behalf by the Regent in 1898 was doubtlociQ a laudablO'idesire to administer justice as between the partners of the Company, and to render nugatory the unauthorized action of Hassan Samaiyeh. There ioj ftjforeover, little -reacon to 4#ub^ibat r -on learning how far the terms of the contract with HerrR.Wonckhaus went, conferring as they did a preferential right of renewal for an indefinite period, the Sheikh may well have felt that his own pecuniary interest in the mines would not, in view of the increasing market value of red oxide, be properly safeguarded by a payment limited indefinitely to a sum of 250 dollars a-year. In these circumstances the Sheikh may- woll have deemed it advisable to protest against the contract with Herr Wonck- haus so soon as he became aware of its purport, rather than to allow this gentleman to acquire, with the lapse of time, a vested interest in.the mines. ^ to JsLsl., t£Lt tit to o/C C c -Px-a. of' The position at the present time appears to His Majesty’s Government to be that Herr Robert Wonckhaus has entered into a contract with Hassan Samaiyeh, who, having acted with out authority from his partners, is unable to carry out his contract, and is consequently liable to Herr Wonckhaus in damages. If, therefore, further steps are taken they should be of a legal character, and it will be at the discretion of Herr Wonckhaus whether they are taken or not.

I WRITE to inform your honour that whereas I have come io know that Haji Hassan-bin^ALi Samayieh and the friends who advise him assert that the oxide mines which are in the Island of Abn Musa are my personal property, and that the lease which was issued by me to Haji Hassan and his partners was given by me in my own right, and not by proxy, in your behalf. I fear that this statement may become a cause of ill-feeling between us ; I have therefore thought it necessary to apprise your honour of it, and to acquaint you with what is in my mind, namely, that I absolutely made no such claim as that which interested parties allege; and I hereby admit that when I came before you in the presence of the British Agent on the 4th Shaaban, 1301, I had no pension or means of subsistence, and you w r ere kind enough to place the Island of Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence, and you did so conditionally that 1 showed loyalty and concord and obedience to you in all respects; and I am w T ell aware that the island in question and the mines which are in it belong to your honour, and that you might at any time decide to take the island from my charge—it is at your disposition to do so, and I have no status or power to gainsay you ; and when I leased the mines of Abu Musa I w 7 as officiating on your behalf, and the Concession was given by proxy for you ; and I w r as well aware that on your return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, if you considered that my action in the matter of the Concession^ w r as good, you would confirm what I had agreed to, and if in your opinion it w r as objectionable, you could annul it either at the time or at any other time ; and I altogether disapprove of the proceedings of Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samayieh in regard to this lease, and in respect of whatever action you took in this connection, that is, in cancelling the document, I was acting in accord with you, seeing that your action w r as taken in consultation with me and for the interests of us all, and in no respect have I any view contrary to yours; and it is in order to dispel doubt from your mind and as an evidence of my singleness of view with you that I have written this, so that you may have cognizance. , _ „ ^ a ,, ^ (Signature and seal of Salnn-bm-Sultan.)

There shall be no deceit and no duplicity m le fulfilment of the conditions which I gave to Sheikh Salim in regard to the display of honour and liberality towards him and in my exchanging views with him m matters affecting our interests, and in the payment to him of the amount of his fixed pension, namely 4,00 French dollars, and I will not give any one’s opinion preference to his, and he can live where he pleases from among the following particular places: Shargar, or Khan, or Hijra. And I hope that God will prosper relations between us and will make the result auspicious both for him and me. This is what had to be written. (Seal of Sagar-bin-Khalid.)Agreement of 1889, dated 5 Shaaban f 1306 (April 6, 1889). This is what we have assembled to arrange. We have come to an agreement in the name of God and in all sincerity, without trickery and deceit, we the Sheikhs Salim-bin-Sultan and Sagar-bin-Kkalid through the mediation of Abdul katif-bin- Abdurrahman, the Agent of Government. What I, Sheikh Sagar, have bound myself to do in regard to Sheikh Salim is that 1 will continue the payment of the pension fixed at 400 dollars per annum, and will show him honour and complete magnanimiG^ and will exchange views with him in regard to matters needing consultation mio. expression of opinion ; and in these which are needful in our own^ interests, and I will not put any one’s opinion before his, and he can live where he likes—^-from Khan to Hijra. . -i . m -i i ci And what I, Sheikh Salam, have bound myself to do m regard to Sheikh Sagar is to fulfil the obligations of docility and obedience and the display of energy in advising him in matters affecting our interests inwardly and outwardly. And if we came to know of anything in the way of misunderstanding that might tend to cause soreness in our minds one against the other, then we will explain it to one another with a view to the removal of misunderstanding and the suppression of the efforts of the mischief makers and intriguers to make misunderstanding between us. And of our own wish and pleasure we have bound ourselves to the British Government to the effect that in the event of any violation on the part of either of us of what is outlined in this deed in the way of conditions, he will be worthy of being held responsible, and will accept what results to him in the way of punishment and revenge from the aforesaid Government as a recompense for his breach. This is what was arranged and settled peaceably. We hope that God will prosper the results of it between us in the direction of prosperity and happiness. Executed and written 5 th Shaaban, 1306.

Previous to this I wrote to you a letter, but received no reply. I hope nothing untoward has prevented you from doing so. You are acquainted with the arrange ments which were effected between me and Sheikh Salem, through the medium of Sheikh Hamid-bin-Abdullah and Hashar-bin-Maktoom. At present the above Sheikhs met at Shargah, and desired Salem to stand by the agreement and arrangement effected by them between me and him. But he did not wish to do so, consequently they have absolved themselves of all responsibility, and revoked their guarantee which they had tended on our behalf, and the arrangements effected between us have been dissolved. At present you are aware that Salem resides at Abu Musa, which is an island dependent on Shargah, and we cannot spare it to others. Perhaps Salem may create some disturbance which may break the maritime peace. I beg therefore to request that you will kindly warn Salem, and inform him that if he is desirous of living at Abu Musa, he must do so with peace, giving you as a guarantee that nothing wrong will be done by him which will disturb the maritime peace. But should he not choose to do so, it will be your choice either to remove him from the island or leave us to settle the matter between us ; and we should not be called to answer in the event of our attacking each other. I leave the matter to your disposal.Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid to Resident, Persian Gulf. (After compliments.) February 14, 1884. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 2nd February, 18i&gt;4, per Mirza Abdul Kasim, and I understand its contents to the effect that anyone attempting to break the maritime peace, whether he be Salem or any o*^£r people, shall be duly repressed. There is no doubt about this. But according to what 1 have already said, I beg to tell you that Bu Musa is our island and a dependency of Shargah. If Salem wants to live in it and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs or disturb the maritime peace, it matters not, because I cannot dispense with the Island of Bu Musa, as it is of great use to me. I beg therefore you will plainly write to me on the subject, and inform your agent of the same. No. 5. Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid’s Explanation of the Position in regard to Abu Musa. In reference to the Island of Abu Musa, it is well known to everybody that it is the property of the Sheikhs of the Jowasim of Oman, and on that point there is no doubt. As to the residence of my uncle in it, the facts of the matter are as explained below:— From olden days, from the time of my ancestors Sheikh Sultan and others, it was their habit in the days of spring, after a fall of rain and the sprouting of vegetation, to sen! their live-stock to the Island of Abu Musa for grazing, and also a number of our subjects from Shargah and Khan habitually sojourned on the island during the winter for fishing purposes, and had houses and huts there. In the year 1300 Hijri Sheikh Salim, who was then ruling Chief of Shargah, after sending his live-stock there as usual, went over to the island, and by the fate ordained by God the populace called upon me to become their Ruler in place of Sheikh Salim, and I accepted their call and occupied the post of the Sheikhdom. It was then open to me to expel Sheikh Salim from Abu Musa Island, and I addressed the Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject in letters which must be available on your records; the first was dated the 22nd Rabi-ul-Awal, 1301, and the second the 14th Rabi II, 1301, but the Resident pressed me to make a peaceable settlement so that there might be no cause for a breach of the maritime peace. Accordingly we agreed that I would set apart for Sheikh Salim a pension for his subsistence—every year 600 dollars. That settlement afterwards became void by my not being able to pay the amount fixed, and subse quently a second agreement was come to between us under which I was to pay him yearly 400 dollars and also the income derived from the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, which was expected, to approach 200 dollars. This agreement also became void, and in the year 1306 we made a third agreement with Sheikh Salim by the mediation of the Government Agent, and in view of the fact that up to this agreement no income had been obtainable from Sir Abu Nuair for Sheikh Salim, mention of the island was omitted and his pension remained at the previous figure of 100 dollars, but I now agreed to the return of Sheikh Salim to Shargah, and I took him into my seiwice. Then, later on in the year 1315, I went on the Mecca pilgrimage and appointed Sheikh Salim to act for me in the Shargah Government, and on my return Sheikh Salim informed me that he had been afforded an opportunity, and had seen it to our interest, to lease the mines of Abu Musa to three persons subject to the British Government. I did not repudiate it, and saw nothing objectionable in it, and so I acquiesced in it; and seeing that Sheikh Salim had ceased not to complain that the sum of 400 dollars was not sufficient for his subsistence, I voluntarily set aside the amount of this rent for him, that it might make up his subsistence, so that the total of what came in to him yearly might be 600 dollars as before, and over, and that no cause of soreness might be left to him on account of the paucity of his allowance. I have absolutely not given him any deed in connection with the island nor in regard to the mines therein; all I did was to relinquish the income to him, in the way of financial assistance from me to him, and it was done voluntarily and at my own discretion. And I have not ceased in the days of spring in years when there has been [565] E14 rain and herbage to send my live-stock to the island for grazing purposes, as has been our custom from of old ; and my flag ceases not to fly there. Such are the facts of the matter, and I have recorded them for your information. (Signature and seal of Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khalid-bin-Sultan.) » No. 6. Memorandum showing the connection of the Jowasim Clan, the Ruling Chief of Shargak, and Sheikh Salim-hin-Sultan, respectively, with Aha Musa Island, as indicated by the Archives of the Bushire Residency. More than a century and a-half ago the Chiefs of the Jowasim Clan of Arabs, at that time paramount in authority on what was known as the “ pirate coast ” of Oman, with head-quarters at Kas-el-Khaima and Shargab, crossed over to the Persian Coast with their war craft and captured the port of Lingah and other places on the coast. There they remained in occupation for upwards of a century, one of the ruling family from Pas-el-Khairna, acting as Chief of the branch of the tribe which remained on the Persian Coast; having its seat of Government at Lingah, but remaining subject to the overlordship of the ruling Chief of the head-quarters of the tribe, then at Pas-el-Khaima. At that time as now practically all the islands in the Gulf were permanently or at certain seasons tenanted by Arabs tribes ; and several of them, including Abu Musa, by the Jowasim. In the pearling season the tribal fishing-boats would have recourse to these islands for water or for refuge from stress of weather; in the spring, after rain, the various Sheikhs would send their horses and flocks for grazing, and in the winter parties of their subjects habitually sojourned in the islands for fishing purposes. Time went on and the sections of the Jowasim on the Persian Coast after some generations became as it were permanent settlers there and quarrels began to arise between parties of them and their kinsmen from Oman sojourning on the islands, when their grazing interests clashed. In order to put an end to this recurrent friction the Chiefs of the Clan came to a friendly understanding under which particular islands were henceforth to be used exclusively by different portions of the tribe. Under this understanding Abu Musa fell to the Shargah branch, and the arrangement then made has never been disturbed. While not ordinarily intervening in the internal politics of the Jowasim or other Arab tribes in Treaty relations with them, the British authorities have in practice recognized this position, and, in pursuance of their time honoured policy of maintaining the ‘ 4 maritime truce,” the principles of which, as we have specifically notified to the tribes, are held to apply to the islands of the Gulf as well as its waters, we have interfered in the present instance in so far as that when alien tribesmen from Debai and elsewhere have attempted to send their flocks for grazing, or otherwise to meddle with Abu Musa Sir Bu Nuair Islands, they have been directed either to desist or first obtain the acquiescence of the ruling Sheikh of Shargah in their proceedings. It is true that on one or two occasions the Persian Government, apparently from ignorance or misconception of the history of these islands generally, have attempted to insinuate a claim to Abu Musa, but in 1888, when this claim was first asserted, in conjunction with a similar one in connection with Sirri, Colonel E. C. Boss, for eighteen years Besident in the Persian Gulf, writing to Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, on the 28th April, 1888, observed: “ The claim now put forward to the Island of Abu Musa has no justification whatever and any attempt to assert Persian authority there in a practical form would lead to disturbance.” Again in April 1904 when an over zealous Belgian Customs official proceeded to the island and incontinently hauled down the Shargah flag and hoisted the Persian emblem in its place, the Persian Government was called upon to repair the unwarranted affront, and a British man-of-war was sent to see that it had been done and that the Arab flag was replaced with due ceremony. Thus, as far as the Jowasim are concerned the position which existed from time immemorial has been maintained up to the present moment, and every year in the spring, when and after rain has fallen and vegetation made its appearance, the ruling Sheikh of Shargah and his immediate relations have been in the habit of sending their live-stock to graze on the island.15 So much for the abstract history of Abu Musa as an appanage of Shargah. We may now turn to the aspects brought into relief by the present misunderstanding in Connection with (die grant of a Concession for mining oxide on the island. In the year 1883, the ruling Chief of Shargah was Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan. He had held the reins of tribal Government for about eighteen years, hut his regime w r as a weak and unpopular one. This Sheikh had taken a particular and enterprising interest in Ahu Musa and had planted some date groves and built himself a rough residence there. In the spripg of 1883 he w 7 as according to his habit spending a few weeks there with the trmal horses and flocks and had left his nephew, Sagar-bin-Khalid, a young man of about 25 years of age, in charge of his head-quarters at Shargah. Among these Arab Chieftains the principle of “ might is right ” prevails, and Sagar-bin-Khalid, finding that the majority of the tribesmen of the principality were tired of his uncle’s rule, and ready to support himself in a coap d'etat, seized the government and proclaimed himself Sheikh on the 4th April, 1883, informing the Resident of his action. The British authorities leave these questions of personnel to the will of the tribes concerned, and usually do no more than recognize the individual whom the support and choice of the tribe puts in a position to handle the reins of government; and in this case Sheikh Sagar received recognition in due course. As soon as he had made sure of his position he addressed the Resident (on the 17th May, 1883) saying that he now proposed to expel Sheikh Salim from Abu Musa. In reply he was reminded that the Residency had in former years specifically notified to the Trucial Chiefs that the principles of the maritime truce must be held to apply to the islands as well as the seas of the Persian Gulf, and that he should consequently endeavour to arrange a peaceable settlement with his uncle. Simultaneously Sheikh Salim left Abu Musa for Lingah, and thence wrote to the Resident asking his good oflices. He in turn was advised to remain in Lingah (it being more convenient for purposes of communication) until he could come to an understanding with Sheikh Sagar. Being in the weaker position Salim soon came to terms and a settlement guaranteed by the Sheikhs of Ras-el-Khaima and Debai was arrived at in July 1883, under which Sheikh Salim was to receive a pension of 600 dollars per annum for his niciintGUciiiCG • A copy of the settlement is attached. Sheikh Salim, however, found it difficult to refrain from intriguing against his nephew, in the hope, no doubt, of getting back the Sheikhdom. ^ . Thus, on the 21st January, 1884, Sheikh Sagar complained to the Resident ot Ins uncle’s conduct, and in the course of his letter he wrote: “ At present you are aware that Salim resides on Bu Musa, which is an island dependent on Shargah, and 1 cannot spare it to others, and perhaps Salim may create some disturbance which may break the maritime peace. I beg, therefore, that you will kindly w^arn Salim and inform him that if he is desirous of living at Ahu Musa lie must do so peaceably, you being his guarantee that nothing wrong will he done by him of a nature to disturb the maritime peace. But should he not choose to obey it will be your choice either to remove him from the island or to leave us to settle the matter between us, and in that case we should not be called to account in the event of our attacking one another. I leave the matter to your disposition. In reply the Sheikh was informed that if either party broke the maritime peace he would be promptly repressed. , . , i . ^ About this time the Sheikhs of Ras-el-Khaima and Debai also complained to the Resident against Sheikh Salim’s violation of the Agreement, guaranteed as it had been Tl P^YYl VOS ^ On the 14th February following Sheikh Sagar again wrote to the Resident, nolitelv urging that it was all very well for him to say that whoever broke the maritime peace, would be repressed, but reminding him that Abu Musa was his- Sheikh Sagar’s property—a hereditary appanage of Shargah. He added. « If Salim wants to live there and guarantees that he will not commit anything which w-ould interfere with my affairs, or disturb the maritime peace, so be it; but I cannot dispense with this island, which is of the greatest use to me. I beg theie- fore, that you will plainly write to me on the subject, and likewise instruct your agent.”On this letter was recorded an office note to the following effect: “Sheikh Sagar seems to insist that if Salim continues to live on Bn Musa he should give a guarantee through the Resident that he will not do anything to disturb him, Sheikh Sagar, or the maritime peace.” On th£ 5th April Sheikh Sagar wrote the Resident another letter pressing for a reply to the above. He added that he had communicated his precise object in writing to the Residency Agent, who would explain it. This was that now that spring^ad arrived he wished to send his horses as usual for grazing, and was not sure whether Sheikh Salim would leave them and their caretakers in peace. If the Resident would not allow him to make his own arrangements for ensuring safety of life and property on the island he wanted an assurance from the Residency that his stud would not be molested by Sheikh Salim. Sheikh Salim, however, who was now getting into financial straits, solved the difficulty himself. He made an appeal to the Residency alleging that Sheikh Sagar and the guarantors of the Agreement of 1883 had not stood by the terms of it; that they had taken away the State horses which as Sheikh of Shargah he had with him on the island when his nephew ousted him from the Sheikhdom, that he. Sheikh Salim, had had to sell all he possessed to maintain himself and now had nothing left, and that he had now come to beg his nephew to provide him with the wherewithal for a bare living. He declared that if he got this he would remain in peace and quietude. Finally he begged our Agent to intercede for him, and to induce Sheikh Sagar to act up to the Agreement. By the advice of the Residency Agent, Sheikh Sagar, who had found the 600 dollars somewhat too much for his purse, consented to pay his uncle a reduced allowance of 400 dollars annually, half of which only was to be paid in cash and the other half in grain and other articles. He also promised to assign to Sheikh Salim the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, which contained some salt deposits and was expected to bring in about 200 dollars more. A document in the above sense was drawn up at a meeting at Ajman and there ratiSed. 'When reporting the conclusion of this Agreement the Residency Agent mentioned that Sheikh Salim w r as at present going on a visit to Ras-el-Khaima and that his family would spend the hot weather there and the winter on Abu Musa. Things went on smoothly after this for a time, but the two Sheikhs eventually got at loggerheads again and in April 1889 our Agent reported that Salim had endeavoured to raise an attack on Shargah. On getting wind of his uncle’s intentions Sheikh Sagar, as usual, asked the advice of the British Agent and the latter soon succeeded in bringing about a friendly meeting between the two resulting in the framing of a third Agreement in supercession of the preceding ones. This was to the following effect; Sheikh Sagar bound himself to pay his now aged uncle the 400 dollar pension regularly and to permit him to return to the mainland of Oman and to live where he pleased within certain limits. He also offered to take Sheikh Salim into his service as Vizier or chief adviser and to consult him in all matters affecting the interests of the State. Sheikh Salim in turn under took to serve his nephew in obedience and loyalty. No mention was made of Sir Bu Nuair in this Agreement because it had hitherto disappointed previous expectations and had not brought in anything. The above has held good and no further documentary agreement has since been necessary. On the conclusion of it Sheikh Salim came to live in Shargah as his nephew’s adviser and for some years past the two have been the best of friends, so much so that when Sheikh Sagar leaves his head-quarters, which he not infrequently does, he always leaves his uncle to officiate in the Government of Shargah, as he did, for instance, on his departure for the Mecca pilgrimage in 1897-8. It was on return from the said pilgrimage in 1898 that his uncle informed him of the grant of the Abu Musa Oxide Concession; when, in view of the fact that since the reduction of his pension from 600 to 400 dollars, Sheikh Salim had always been complaining of the paucity of his income. Sheikh Sagar as an act of generosity decided to let his uncle enjoy the 250 dollars annual rent fixed for the Concession and thereby cease to have cause for further discontent. From first to last, however, Sheikh Sagar’s acquiescence in his uncle’s enjoyment of the produce and income of the island in question, has been purely a personal and verbal arrangement which Sheikh Sagar might, at any time, have terminated had he chosen to do so. No deed rvhatever, according to the statements of the two Sheikhs themselves, has ever been given by Sheikh Sagar to his uncle in regard to this island,f\ ^ JL . 17 although the Island of Sir Abu Nuair did find mention in the second Agreement as above mentioned, dropping out again in the third and last because it had never brought in any income. Stronger proof of the status of the island could hardly be wanted than the declarations furnished by the two Sheikhs themselves. (Signed) P. Z. COX. February 28, 1908. Xo. 7.

As to your remarks on the subject of the red oxide in regard to which God dec4^d that you sold it to the German Wonckhaus at 155. per ton, and whereas it was arranged that you should excavate 2,000 tons per annum, all the charges to he defrayed by you, and he to receive the oxide nett. Very good; I hope it is auspicious. It will he good fortune after trouble. In any case, our brother Abdullah must reach there to supervise the work, because I think the operations cannot be regulated without him. Please, however, refrain from entering upon any arrange ments whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels which will lead to complaints and claims, because this will be difficult for our over-lords and they will not consent to it; and you are by God’s grace wise and will not commit any negligence or hesitation likely to entangle you, because in these days everyone is making a trap with which to entangle people. I hope you will not be neglectful in this regard. At any rate 1 am glad to hear this news, if we are safe from this world’s tricks more than before. I have received your esteemed letter dated the 26th June and perused it gladly and understood what you had stated. You had acknowledged receipt of my letter the contents of which you had understood. As regards the sale to the German, it is satisfactory, and I hope it will be fortunate. You had understood the details regarding the sale, shipment, and boat- hire, but you did not let me know about the commission; is it to be charged by us from them or by them from us ? You had written that I should send you a copy of the agreement. Very well, but the agreement has been written in German, and there is no one with us who can write such a hand. The purport of the agreement is accurately the same as I have written to you. You had written to me whether we had contracted with the German for 2,000 tons per annum. Yes, we have contracted with him that the quantity should be 2,000 tons at least, and he can, according to the agreement take any more quantities which we may be able to obtain from the mines. You had written whether we can obtain more than this quantity, and if so, whether we can contract with other Europeans, so that you may negotiate with them. I have understood this, but I cannot give the accurate quantity unless the mine is worked for two or three months when I will be able to form an idea. I dispatched forty-five workmen to the island in the beginning of June, but little work is done, it being summer and the days being hot. If more than 2,000 tons are obtained, the German is bound to take it from us. We can therefore make no less at Calcutta. Only the freight is to be paid by us, every inaund will be 1 r. 9 a delivery at Calcutta. I have been trying to procure a vessel since a long time. I have now-a-days chartered “ Alimghir,” the vessel belonging to the sons of Khoja (to ship red oxide) at 10 rupees per ton. It is now several days that she has gone to the island to ship (the oxide). t . tt Thank God my son Abdulla has freed himself from the dispute at Calcutta. He has compromised with them. He has come to Bombay, and I will receive his letter from Bombay by this mail, if God pleases. I hope he will not be detained there, and that he will settle his case with Jeita Bania and come to our parts soon. No. 12. Hassan Samayieh to Mr. T. Malcolm. (After compliments.)

I havo received your letter dated the 20th December, 1906, and was glad to hear| of your well-being. 1 have understood what you stated. Regarding my son Abdulla, I beg to say that after settling the case at Calcutta he has arrived at Bombay, where he lias some easy matters to settle with the Bania. He will settle his accoui^nd will leave for our parts in two or one and a-half month 0 . You had remarked that you had asked some one in the post-office to take from me a copy of the document, which is in German. Let it not be hidden from you that the German, when the bargain was concluded with him, said to me that this transaction should be kept secret (“ Yekoon Ma^toor ”), and so I did not wish that any outsider should come to know of it, and I fear that if news of the copying of the document reaches h 1 s ears he will be annoyed. In truth, it is not my intention that anyone should come to know about it except myself and you. What you wanted, namely, the details of the sale which had taken place, 1 have already communicated to you in a previous letter. Procedure will be according to that letter, neither more nor less, in pursuance of what is written in the document. No. 14. Hassan Samayieh to Abdul Latif. (After compliments.) Lingah, 27£A Shawwal, 1324 (December 16, 1906). I wrote to you previously. I hope the letter reached you, and that you are well. Now I forward, inclosed in this letter, a copy of the Agreement regarding the sale of oxide to Wonckhaus, a copy made according to the original. Please acknow ledge receipt. Our news is quiet. I have nothing deserving of mention except to say all well. Inshallah, in these days we expect Abdullah to arrive Bombay in safety, and on his arrival I will apprise you. No. 15. Abdul Latif to Hassan Samayieh. [Inclosure 8 of German Case.] (After compliments.) 8//i Zilhijjah, 1324 (January 23, 1907). I have received your esteemed letter and understood what you stated. I have understood the copy of the Agreement concluded by you with the German for the sale of the Abu Musa red oxide. My son Esa does not agree to the execution of an Agreement to this effect, and you had neither consulted with, nor referred to him, nor did you send him a copy of the Agreement before the settlement with the German of the affair concerning the red oxide, so that views might be exchanged between you both, and that you might adopt a recognized, obvious, and evident course, because It is obligatory for the partners not to undertake a matter except after a general consensus of views, so that no difficulties may occur, and you have undertaken this affair without any consultation. Therefore, my son Esa does not agree to the Agreement concluded between you and the German, because he fears difficulty will result from foreigners concerning themselves in the matter. The nullification of this Agreement is better than its acceptance. You had previously received a letter (from me) saying that you should not involve yourself into difficulties with the German in regard to the red oxide, because he (Esa) fears an untoward result. I communicate to you what my son Esa says.Abdul Latif to Hassan Samavieh. ^ *jp ^ &lt;z^c&lt;^ a h [Inclosure 10 of German Case, which i^wsiiitranslation.] [W;. (After compliments.) 12/A Safar, 1325 {March 27, 1907). Your esteemed letter has reached me in due course, and I have noted its contents. n your communication reached me saying that you had sold to the German before mentioned oxide from Ahu Musa, every year 2,000 tons of oxide at 155. per ton, I sent you hack an answer, dated the 2 3st Kabi II, 1321, which purported to convey acquiescence, but in the course of the same letter I cautioned you against entering into any agreement in the nature of a leasehold or into any relation likely to result in dispute, on the grounds that the overlords of our affairs would not agree to it. I asked you to give us immunity against the complications of the world (time). My letter in question is no doubt with you. Since writing it I have never received from you the copy of the deed of agreement existing between you and the German until the 5th Zilkaadeh, 1321, when it came in English after I had asked you for it time after time. I mentioned its arrival to you in my letter of the 6th Zilkaadeh, 1321. And when we got a translator and translated the English document, it became plain to us that you had launched yourself into the very thing against which we had cautioned you and had tied yourself up by g iving a lease. Consequently, mv s ~' T:, ~- J ^ to this document which does^eave you any power of control or to the oxide mines of Abu Musa. And previous to this present communication I communicated to you in my letter dated 8th Zilhijjeh a translation of the deed for your information and said that you would perceive that the question was not one of mere sale as stated by you, but one of leasehold, against which I had warned you. Moreover, Sheikh Sagar does not agree to the lease of the oxide to outsiders from foreign Powers and claims that the agreement (with him) was that you should do the work yourselves and not farm it out. This is what had to be explained. Hough 'purport of a Petition from Nejef-bin- All, Persian subject, of Bunder Abbas, to Lieutenant Gabriel, dated February 16, 1908. (After compliments.) My father for some years performed service for the British, and as Haji Hassan- bin-Ali Samayieh, cf Lingah, is a British subject, I therefore petition to you as follows :— Concerning the Abu Musa oxide, for which there were four concessionnaires, among whom I hold the deed of partnership of my father. My father had no other heir but myself, and therefore after his death Ilaji Hassan-bin-Ah acknowledged my right of partnership as acquired through my father. At the time when Hassan entered into the agreement with Messrs. VVonckhaus he gave me no information what ever on the subject. Subsequently I made an arrangement with Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar to sell him oxide and sent word to Hassan to this effect. Hassan then wrote me that he had made a contract elsewhere, and would inform me regarding it later. As proof that I did not in any way agree to this contract made by Hassan, I point to the fact that it did not bear my signature, and when, some months later, Abdullah-bin-Hassan and the German Munshi came and asked me to sign it in token of assent, I refused to do so, as I had not been consulted in the first place. As further proof of my right in the Concession, I may mention that in 1901 Abdullah-bin-Hassan had a case in Calcutta against Messrs. Sassoon concerning the Ybu Musa oxide, but seeing that the oxide had been sold in the name of my father, the case could not be proceeded with until I had furnished a power of attorney for the Calcutta Court a copy of this is doubtless on your Consulate records. (Mote by His Britannic Majes y s Consul: The Consulate fee-book shows that Nejef paid 5s. fees for the execution of a power of attorney on the ^9th October, 1904i.) iSow I complain that from tne time tuat Hassan has been actively engaged in the oxide work of Bu Musa, I have not received 1 dinar of the proceeds, although all the work on the island formerly devolved upon my No. 17.father, who himself found the implements, &amp;c., for working the oxide, which implements are even now at the island. Besides all this, there were 250 carpets which belonged to my father, and which were sent to Calcutta for sale. Abdullah-bin-Hassan wanted to settle up the account for them in Calcutta, but until I gave a power of attorney they would not settle with him. Hassan subsequently collected all the money, but I have never been able to recover any of it from him. Now I pray you of your goodness to look after my rights and to obtain me justke against Hassan.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000015_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/128</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000015</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/128</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 161/1908 Pt 2 'Persian Gulf:- Abu Musa Oxide'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1908/1909</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-07-18T22:56:46</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (195 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.The subject 161 (Persian Gulf: Abu Musa Oxide) consists of three volumes: IOR/L/PS/10/127-129.
