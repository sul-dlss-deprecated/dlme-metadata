To $ t i •I The Offgi political resident, Persian Gulf, Baghdad. &gt;'EMORANDUM . £ Reference your Memorandvaa NO.0B81 dated 23rd February 1919 to Political Agent, Koweit, forwarding the draft order in Council for Koweit. I have discussed the question fully with that Officer. His principal desiderata are:- (a) a legal position vis-a-vis British*and European and American subjects in iioweit. This would be ado .uately provided as regards British subjects by Parts (1) to (4), (6) and (7) of the Draft Order. ButV notning in the draft Order provides for the vexed question of Jurisdiction in the case of foreign subjects with respect to whon no Treaty exists (para 8 (3)). The Draft Order, for instance, leaves the Americans where they are now, that is, without anyone who can perform any legal act with respect to them; on the other hand the Shaikh is under agreement.with us to have no direct dealings with a t Foreign State. The point is admittedly a very difficult one y and I only mention it to draw attention to the fact that the Draft does not deal with it. The only possible solution is to communicate our treaties with Koweit to the American govern ment (I think it likely that this has already been done), and ask their consent to our performing specified legal functions in respect of their nationals, but I do not think it likely that they would agree. I fear the question can only be left. (b) a legal position vis-a-vis subjects of Persia, independent Arabjf chiefs, and especially Iraq. As regards the first, it seems very improbable th &gt;.t any Persian Government would give its official consent to any exercise of jurisdiction over their nationalsInationals in Koweit. It ia a kind of point upon which the/ would probably bo very touchy* An informal arrangement not to raise the point if we do undertake the defence of Persian interests, is the most we could hope for, I should think, until things in Tehran have moved a long way. As regards the second, we have just conceded to the dhaikh of bahrain direct jurisdiction over this very class of person, and it would be regarded by Shaikh Salim as a direct blow at his dignity if we assumed Juriadiction, e.g., over subjects of pin baud by a direct agraement with the latter. In the absence of such an agreement, this jurisdiction is directly conceded to t 0 Shaikh by section 44 (4)./ As regards the third category, it is obviously impossible to legislate for them until their international status is defined. Meanwhile, we saw no parti cular advantage in the enactment o*f Part 5 of the Draft Order. It only regulates the existing practice, weakening the political • # Agents hands pro tanto by the admission in paras. 44 (4) and 45 (4), that the Political Agent’s legal powers are limited to a right to be present at the. hcai’ing and final decision. It appeared to us that either the Kuler would be amenable, in which case it is better not to notify to all and sundry that we reeefve no power of legal insistence, or he will bo contu macious, in which oase these two sections will bo a weapon in hie hands. If it la considered necessary to havo a regular procedure prescribed for the hearing of cases between Koweit subjects arid 'persons to whom the Order applies', it would seem prefer able to arrange this diplomatically with the Chief himself, without expressly laying down a limitation on the Political Agent’s powers of interference. The net result of the above is that we do not consider there is any practical advantage in the enactnent of any parts of the Draft Order, other than those intended to regularise the legal position of the Political Agent vis-a-vis British subjects; it is on the other hand evident that some definition of the international position of Iraq subjocts will necesaar iiy Boon be laid down, and it would be advisable to incorporatethis into any order In council that ray bo issued. We therefore considered it advisable to wait until this defi nition is arrived at before proceeding further with the ratter; and I think it is for consideration whether it would not be possible to proceed wiWfc the drafting of an Order for the whole aulf, as soon as the status of Iraq is determined.

(3) In cases tried under this article no different sentence can be passed from the sentence which could be passed in .England if the crime were tried there. (4) The foregoing provisions of this article shall be deemed to be adaptations, for the purposes of this Order and of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, of the following en actments, namely: — The Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act, 1849; The Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act, 1860; The Merchant Shipping Act 1894, Part XIII; and those enactments shall apply accordingly, and be admin istered in Kuwait. v‘20.

A copy of a memorandum orawn up by the Library of this Department on the pre-war hietory of this question is enclosed herein. From the i»e^,l point of view and on the supposition that there is no intention of including koweit within the boundaries of iuesopotaoia the status of this terri tory wouia appear to be governed by article 152 of the Treaty of Sevres. 5. In practice, provided some prior agreement were reached with the Sultan of Koweit, it would seem unlikely that any foreign power would challenge the issue of an Uruar-in-MOuncil on the lines of bne’Panrein Order-in- Council, 1913* although tne extension of British jurisdiction, as in that truer, to foreigners in Koweit might The ,nder Secretary of State, Colonial- Office.1 v l &gt; » might involve the prior concurrence of ecrne forei^pi powers^ in this connection Lord Gurzon woiild be glad to learn whether in fact, m^ny foreisers are now resident at or visit Koweit and if so # what their nationality is* 4.

(F. 19867/1911) islands of the Persian Gulf ana Gulf of Oman lying within the Persian dominions. The India Office concurred as to the desirability of those alterations and asked that if ^ his kajesty^ i inister at Tehran were of the same opinion, the necessary steps should be taken for the issue of the amending Order. It was felt here, however,that the proposals in question were inaaequate and merely tinkered at a question that required more drastic treatment, and that the political and judicial spheres of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be rendered coincidenttv coincident by putting into force a Persian Grulf Order-in- Council providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in all the territories bordering upon the uulf in which administrative control was vested in the Resident, and consequently superseding the existing Persian Coast and Islands and Luscat Orders and rendering superfluous the contemplated separate Crder for Bahrein. Courts should be established wherever officials were to be found fit to exercise judicial powers and provision siould be made to vary them with comparative ease. 2. It was proposed that there should be a superior court to be held by the Resident a* by a person speciallyarpointed for the purpose, to which appeals would lie from the local courts* The law and machinery of the Order, within the limits of which would be included Muscat, the Trueial States, Bahrein and Koweit, would be similar to that provided in the Persian Coast and Islands Order* 3* The Government of India, however, agreed with the Political Resident in thinking that such a single comprehensive Order, embracing both the Persian and the Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf, was undesirable even if practicablepracticable, and that the most that could be done would be to have an Order in Council that would cover the Arab principalities from Koweit to Muscat inclusive, 4* In view of this unfavourable attitude it was decided to abandon the idea cf a unified Order-in*Council to pass a Persian Coast end lelanoe (amendment) Order-in* Council, and to proceed with the draft Bahrein Order that had been held up pending the consideration of the larger question. The question of the extension of an Order-in- Council to the Trucial Chiefs was left over until a settlement had been arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab littoral. b. By the Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 29, 1913, respecting the Persian Gulf end Adjacent Territories an arrangement was concluded in regard to Koweit (Articles 1-10). By the terms of the agreement the Sheikh was recognised es Kaimakam of an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire; the boundaries of his immediate territory end his wider tribal jurisdiction wens delimited; the Ottoman Government recognised existing agreements between the Sheikh and His Majesty's GovernmentUovemment; and His Majesty’s (government undertook, on their part, not to alter the nature of British relations with the Government of Kuweit or to establish a protectorate there, so lon^ as the status quo, as defined in the Convention, underwent no change. The convention has, however, never been ratified* 6* In September 1914 several assurances were &amp;iven to the Sheikh of Koweit in return for the valuable co-operation which was expected from him in the event of a war with Turkey, one of the assurances being that Koweit should be recoilssd as an independent principality under British protection. These assurances have been renewed on severaljsubpequent occasions* Forei-^i Office, July 16, 1921. ■Cg^ - P*3495.

I have assumed that in broad terms it ia intended to adhere to the draft Order in Council forwarded under cover of the Acting Civil Commissioner’s memorandum No. 38114, dated the 22nd December 1919, in which a 'foreigner ' 1 is defined as 'any person not a British or Kuwait subject, and a 'Kuwait subject', as M a subject of the Bhaikh of Kuwait, or the subject, resident at Kuwait, of any other non-Chris tian power not represented by a consul at Kuwait'. 3. According to these definitions the only foreigners at present resident in Kuwait whom I am able to trace are:- • Americana G These are all members of the American i^sio A and the number is not likely to be increased. The only Arerican visitors are missionaries who occasionally come ashore for a few hours when passing through, and, at rare intervals an American steamer which calls at the port. Portuguese subjects 4.- wo Coanese families, both in the regular service of British subjects, o Portuguese subjects, except Goanese, visit .uwait, and they, only for service wit British subjects or Americans. v french subjects .- hs only BAGHDAD Sir I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your- &amp;l&gt;le to trace is an Algerian mendicant. There may, however, he a few others of whom I am unaware, as natives of French Somaliland occasionally find their way to Kuwait as members pk of the crews of sailing vessels. Italian subjects .- There are none resident at present, hut sailors from hritrea occasionally visit Kuwait. buanish subjects .- I have never heard of any visiting Kuwail hut an occasional pilgrim or mendicant from Spanish iorroco may possibly do so. 4. I have sounded the Shaikh of Kuwait and am satisfied that he would raise no objection to I is i.ajesty's Government exercising jurisdiction over the above classes, in addition, of course,to British subjects, and also to Kuwait subjects registered as being in the permanent service of British subjects. 5. Unless strong pressure were brought to bear upon him, he would not agree to British jurisdiction being exercised over the subjects of non-Christian Powers, with the except ion of Japanese and Chinese. No subjects of either power ar« resident in Kuwait, but steamers of both countries do visit the territorial waters at rare intervals. 6 . Of the subjects of non-Christian powers resident in Kuwait who are not actual subject© of the Shaikh of Kuwait the two most numerous classes are the Persians and the Hajdis. I estimate that there are at present about 10,^00 'persons of Persian origin in Kuwait town; many of these, however, have been settled here for two or three generations and have presumably lost their Persian nationality. As there is no form of registration it is impossible to say how many •Persian subject* there are; the number is probably over 6,000, though I doubt if 5,000 could, or would take the trouble to, prove their nationality if the question were raised. In addition to the Persians permanently and tempora rily settled in Kuwait, a considerable number of Persian sailing boats visit the port annually. It is still harder \ *\ to estimate the number of Najd subjects, as the great K * majority of the inhabitants of Kuwait are of —' —case of Bedouin accompanying caravans• The same applies in a lesser degree to the subjects of Bahrain and the other Arab principalities of the Persian (kilf. There are no Hijaz subjects actually settled in Kuwait, hut an average of perhaps thirty pass throug annually, largely mendicants en route for 'Iraq* There are at present twelve Turkish subjects in the town. 7. It is impossible even to give the number of British subjects accurately, as there is 1 a considerable, and fluctuating, number of Somalis and other Africans under British protection, largely sailors, who never come near the Agency, except occasionally when they require the help of the Political Agent. I estimate, however, that there are at present 175 British subjects in the town, made up as follows ritish 4 I ritish Indians 22 Arabs with British nationality 21 Egyptian 1 Somalis k other Africans under British protection.about lOO &gt; Total 175. To these may be added 36 Kuwait subjects and foreigners (including the four Portuguese subjects mentioned in para graph 3 above) in the permanent service of British subjects, who, in practice, always have been looked on as British subjects while thus employed. About 200 Indians, crews of sailing boats, pilgrims, etc., visit Kuwait annually, and, with few exceptions, the steamers which visit the port are all British ships. 8 . I have not included X * Iraqis, regarding whose status I referred in my memorandum No. 64-0 dated the 12th April 1921, under any of the above heads. I presume that they are entitled to British protection, but up to the present no •Iraqi has applied to me for assistance as such. There is much intercourse between 'Iraq and Kuwait, ?nd the number of ’Iraqis in the town is considerable , but, as in the cast of ajdis, there is little by which one MM? can distlnguis Tthem from the ordinary inh ititants, and *&lt;x he uselssa to attempt to eatimaae their number without annually reflate: ins them and inquiring into doubtful ca»o»j, T:rt thaikh of Kuwait would certainly prefer •Iraq aubjectt* to be under his own jurisdiction* but X do not think he is likely to prove obstinate if the matter be pressed, Palestine and Syrian subjects* as British and Prench protected persons respective* ly* mi^ht conveniently be considered under this head, keithe: are at present settled in, or frequently visit Kuwait* and the question would not greatly interest the Shaikh* 9. I presume from the wording of the draft Order in Council that there 1% no intention of asking the Shaikh of Kuwait to agree to His Majesty’s Government exercising jurisdiction with respect to the subjects of non-Christ!an pov/ers referre&lt; to in paragraph 6 above. I am of opinion that to do so would almost certainly lead to friction with the Bhaikh of Kuwait* without proportionately increasing British trade or prestig&lt; and that it would therefore not be in our interests to do so unless, or until, any of the Bulers or Governments concerned request us to do so, or wish to establish consuls of their own. If I be right in this assumption* I would suggest that the word 'Muslim' might be substituted for 'non-Christian' in the definition of a 'Kuwait subject' referred to in para graph 2 above* and that the Shaikh of Kuwait be definitely asked to agree to the exercise of jurisdiction by His I : ajesty f s Government in respect of all 'foreigners'* which letter term would then include the classes enumerated in paragraph 3 above* together with any European* American* Japanese or Chinese steamers which might at any time visit the port. As, in practice, this would me fin little more than recognising British jurisdiction with respect to the members of the American Mission, I think he would readily agree to i as also he would in the case of Kuwait subjects in the regu lar service of British subjects or foreigners, on the condi tions laid down in aub-section 3 of paragraph 8 of the draft Order in Council. f 10. As I am certain that, in practice, the Shaikh would no-Americans or the Portuguese subjects (even If he knows that the latter are not British subjects) without referenc&lt; to me t I see no immediate urgency for the Order in Council being passed.

A copy of a memorandum drawn up to the Library of this Department on the pre-war history of this question is enclosed herein. From the legal point of view and on the supposition that there is no intention-of including Koweit , within the boundaries of Mesopotamia the status of this territory would appear to be governed by article 132 of tbe Treaty of Sevres..^v - ' I .5. In jpraotioe, provided eome prior agreenent were reached vvith the Sheikh of Koweit, it would seen unlikely that any Foreign power would challenge the issue of an Order-in-Council on the lines of the Bahrain Order-in-Council, 1915, although the extension of British jurisdiction, as in that O^der, to foreigners in Koweit might involve the prior concurrence of some foreign powers. In this connection Lord Curzon would he glad to learn whether in fact, many foreigners are now resident at or visit Koweit and if so, what their nationality is. 4. in any case, Lord Curzon would suggest that, in the first instance, bin r. Cox night be instructsl to open negotiations with the Sheikh with a view to ascertaining what measure of British supervision the latter is prepared to accept and that h 0 night be informed that, if possible, the actual issue o^ any Order in Council, consolidating the agreement, eventually reached with the oh^ikh, should be postponed until the entry into force of the Turkish Treaty.

Proposed jurisdictional Order-in -Council for Koweit. — tt-fw/w) In May and June 1911 the India Office forwarded copies of a long correspondence that had been carried on between the Government of India and the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, suggesting the amendment of the 'Persian Coast and T «lands Order in Council, iQOh' 30 as to bring within its scope Mohammareb with its dependencies, the coast and Maritime provinces of Persia from Mohammareh to Gwettur, both inclusive, and the Islands of the Persian Gulfy&amp;nd Gulf of Oman lying within the Persian dominions. The India Office concurred as to the deisrability of those alter ations and asked thatvif His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran were of the same opinion the necessary steps should be taken for the'/ s N issue of an amending Order. il was felt here, however, that the Proposals in question were inade^uauo and merely tinkered at a question that require more drastic treatment, and that the Political and .judicial ' spheres of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should he rendered coincident hby putting into force a Persian Gulf Order In Council providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in all the territories bordering upon the Gulf in which administrative coriorol was vested in the Resident, and consequently supersedinr 'the existing Persian Coast and Islands and Muscat Orders and • • f rendering superflous the contemplated separate Order for Bahrain. Courts should be established wherever officials were to he found fit to exercise judicial powers and provision should he made to vary them with comparative ease. It was proposed that there should be a sunerior Court to be held by the Resident or by a person SDecially aupointed for the purpose, to which appeals would lie from the local Courts The law and machinery of the order, within the limits of which would be included Muscat, the Trucial States, Bahrain and Koweit, would be similar to that provided in the Persian Coast and Islands Order. 3. The Government of India, however, agreed with the Political Resident in thinking that such a single comubrehensive Order, embracing both the Persian and the Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf, was undesirable even if practicable, and that the most that could be done would be to have an Order in Council that would cover the Arab principalities from Koweit to Muscat inclusive. 4. In view of this unfavourable attitude it was decided to abandon the idea of a unified Order-in-Council, to pass a Persian Coast and Islands (amendant) Order in Council, and to proceed with the draft Bahrain Order that has been held'up pendinr the consideration of the larger question. The question of the extension of an Order in Council to the Trucial Cheifs was left, over until a settlement had bean arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab Littoral. 5. By the Anglo-Turkiah Convention o** duly 29 , iai% respecting the Persian Gulf and adjacent Territories and arrangement was concluded in regard to Koweit (Articles l-*»n). V- -x ^ M ■ fufi ( tf By the oerraa of tha a.rr'eanent the Sheihh was reoojpnisevi. as Kaimakam of an autonomous Kaza of the Ottoman Empire, t^e hounlaries of his immeliat 0 territory and his wii.er tribal jurisdiction were delimited; the Ottoman Government recognised exist'iiiw agreements between the Sheikh and Hia Majesty’s Government, and His Majesty’s Government undertook, on their part, not to alter the nature o^ British relations tfith the Government of Kowiet or to esta.hlish a protectorate there, so long as the status quo, as defined in the convention, underwent no change. The Convention has, however, never been ratified. 6. In September 1914 several assurances were given to the - f Sheikh of Koweit in return for the valuable co-operation which was expected from him in the event of a war with Turkey, one of the assurances being that Koweit should be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. These assurances have been renewed on several subsequent occasions. Foreign Office, July IGth, 1921.British KeBidency and Oonaulate-doneral, Buahirs, 3rd January 102X.

T venture to submitsubmit that, If the above assumption is correct, this procedure hardly seems suitable for an Order-in-Council. In the first place I venture to think that the Judicial procedure at the different places on the Arabian Littoral should run on the same lines and throuj^h the aame channels; at preoerrtj^the Ordera-in-Oounoil for Mas oat and Bahrain, Indian uaw is administered each place being treated as if it were a district in the Presidency of Bombay with Political Agent the principtil Judicial authority in it &amp; appeal to the kesident at Jiuahire as Chief Court, I am not clear whether it is intended to retain this procjedure or not. Secondly if this procedure is not retained it will cause a good deal of inconvenience and dislocation to change the channel of appeals etc from Baghdad to Bushire v/hen Sir Percy Cox leaves Baghdad. In the circumstances it is unnecessary for me to comment on the original draft order-in-Council or on Major More*a comments. I need only remark that I think the Order-in- Council should follow the lines of the Hascat Order-in- Council rather than those of the Bahrain Order-in-Council, and that I agree with Major ?iore in thinking the word t 'Muslim' raight be aubaituted for 'non-Christian in the A definition of 'Kuwait subject' in Article 4, I have the honour to be, 3ir, Your most obedient servant. 3d/- a.P.

Apart from the difficulties arising out of this particular clause, it appears useless to proceed with the drafting of the Order in Council until a definite decision is reached regarding the future control of political affairs at Kov/eit.

In this connection I am to enclose a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office dated the 11th of April 1922, and to explain that, owirvt to the difficulties arising out of the clause in the draft Order in Council relating to the exercise of jurisdiction over foreigners, His Grace’s predecessor decided that no further progress could '“n be made in the matter pending the conclusion of a Treaty of Peace with Turkey. As, however, a Treaty has now been signed at Lausanne and will shortly enter into force, His Grace is disposed to thirk that nerjliminary steps might now advantageously be taken with a view to the promulgation of an Order in Council for Koweit so soon as the Treaty of Lausanne becomes operative. His Grace has examined the draft Order in Council which accompanied your letter under reference, and, subject to any considerations which may be present to the Foreign Office to whom a copy of this letter has been sent, he sees no political objections to its terras.

It was pointed out therein that the issue of an Order in Council containing a provision for British jurisdiction over foreigners in Koweit might be liable to evoke protests from foreign Powers, and it was suggested that it would, therefore, be well to obtain the formal consent of the United States, the French, the Italian, the Portuguese and the Japanese Governments to the a^p^rowi before issuing the Order in Council. 3. Ihe Secretary of State remains of opinion that, if it is desired to promulgate the Order in Council as originally drafted and enclosed in India Office letter of the 12th May 1920, it would be desirable to obtain the formal assent of the above Powers. It is not, ihsxx however, considered that the present, or indeed the near future, is a propitious time for approaching these Powers with a proposal of this nature. 4. I am, therefore, to suggest as an alternative, for His Graced consideration, that article 8(2J of the draft Order in Council be amended to read 'Poreigiers with respect to whom ' the Sheikh of Koweit and the governmen ts of the gauntries ' of which they are nationals have agreed with His ' Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction \ n by His Majesty’*. 5. Ihus amended the Order in Council can be promulgated as soon as the Treaty of Lausanne shall have come into force, with out it being necessary for His Majesty’s Government to approach any foreign Power on the subject until such time as a national of a foreign Power commits some crime or misdemeanour necessitatingnecessitsting proceedings against him.

Letter No. 206-C„ dated 4th December 1921, from the Political Agent Kuwait, to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad. 2.1 understand that the present arrangement is that the Colonial Office is now responsible for the policy on the Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf, and that as regards Bahrain, and possibly Mascat its control is to be exercised through this Residency, but that in respect of Kuwait it is to be exercised through the High Commissioner, Baghdad, as long as His Excellency Sir Percy Cox is the incum bent of that post but afterwards through this Residency. I venture to submit that, if the above assumption is correct, this procedure hardly seems suitable for an Order-in-Council. In the first place I venture to think that the judicial procedure at the different places on the Arabian Littoral should run on the same lines and through the same channels ; at present under the Orders-in-Council for Mascat (Pro. No. 21 in S. G., March 1916, Nos. 14-30) and Bahrain, (Pro. No. 14 in S. G., Octr. 1916, hsos. India,n Law is administered each place being treated as if it were a district in the Presidency of Bombav with Political Agent the principal judicial authority m it and appeal to the Resident at Bushire as Chief Court. I am not clear whether it is intended to retain this procedure or not. Secondly if this procedure is not retained it will cause a good deal of incon venience and dislocation to change the channel of appeals, etc., from Baghdad to Bushire when Sir Percy Cox leaves Baghdad. In the circumstances it is unnecessary fcr me to comment on the Original draft Order-in-Council or on Major More’s comments. I need only remark that I think the Order-in-Coiincil should follow the lines of the Mascat Order-m-Council rather than those of the Bahrain Order-in-Council. (It does so ; videVio. iSo 22 in G. B. Oct. 1922*' Nos. 22-38) and that I agree with Major More m thinking the word “ Muslim ” might be substituted for “ non-Christian ” in the definition of “ Kuwait subject ” in Article 4. ^ ^ H # Enclo I of Ser.

II of Sw. No. (7).— Letter from Major J. C. More, D.S.O., Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Scretary to H. E. the High Commissioner for ’Iraq, Baghdad, No. 206-C., dated the 4th December 1921. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum iSo. 18279- 7-37, datedthe 17th October 1921, relative to the proposed Kuwait Order-m-Council. 2. I have assumed that in broad terms it is intended to adhere to the draft- Order-in-Council forwarded under cover of the Acting Civil Commissioner s me morandum No. 38114, dated the 22nd December 1919 (see Enclo. of Pro. No. 22 in G. B., Octr. 1922, Nos. 22-38), in which a “foreigner” is defined as “ any person not a British or Kuwait subject, and a “ Kuwait subject,” as “ a subject of the Shaikh of Kuwait, or the subject, resident at Kuwait, of any other non-Christian power not represented by a Consul at Kuwait.” 3. According to these definitions the only foreigners at present resident in Kuw'ait whom I am able to trace are :— Americans G. —These are all members of the American Mission and the number is not likely to be increased. The only American visitors are missionaries who occasionally come ashore for a few hours when passing through, and, at rare intervals an American steamer which calls at the port. Portuguese subjects 4. —Two Goanese families, both in the regular service of British subjects. No Portuguese subjects, except Goanese, visit Kuwait, and they, only for service with British subjects or Ameri cans. French subjects. —The only French subject whom I have been able to trace is an Algerian mendicant. There may, however, be a few others of whom I am unaware, as natives of French Somaliland occasionally find their way to Kuwait as members of the crews of sailing vessels. Italian subjects.—-There are none resident at present, but sailors from Eritrea occasionally visit Kuwait. Spanish subjects. —I have never heard of any visiting Kuwait but an occa sional pilgrim or mendicant from Spanish Morroco may possibly do so. 4. I have sounded the Shaikh of Kuwait and am satisfied that he would raise no objection to His Majesty’s Government exercising jurisdiction over the above classes, in addition, of course, to British subjects, and also to Kuwait subjects registered as being in the permanent service of British subjects. 5. Unless strong pressure were brought to bear upon him, he would not agree to British jurisdiction being exercised over the subjects of non-Christian Powers, with the exception of Japanese and Chinese. No subjects of either power are resident in Kuwait, but steamers of both countries do visit the territorial waters at rare intervals. 6. Of the subjects of non-Christian powers resident in Kuwait who are not actual subjects of the Shaikh of Kuwait the two most numerous classes are the Persians and the Najdis. I estimate that there are at present about 10,000 persons of Persian origin in Kuwait town ; many of these, however, have been settled here for two or three generations and have presumably lost their Persian nationali ty. As there is no form of registration it is impossible to say how many actual Persian subjects there are ; the number is probably over 6,000, though I doubt if 5,000 could, or would take the trouble to, prove their nationality if the question were raised. In addition to the Persians permanently and temporarily settled in Kuwait, a considerable number of Persian sailing boats visit the port annually. It is still harder to estimate the number of Najd subjects, as the great majority of the inhabitants of Kuwait are of Najd origin, case of Bedouin accompanying caravans. The same applies in a lesser degree to the subjects of Bahrain and the other Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf. There are no Hijaz subjects actually settled in Kuwait, but an average of perhaps thirty pass through annually, largely mendicants en route for ’Iraq. There are at present twelve Turkish subjects • in the town. ••'?- /^N 7. It is impossible even to give the number of British subjecis accurately, as there is a considerable, and fluctuating, number of Somalis and other Africans under British protection, largely sailors, who never come near the Agency, except occasionally when they require the help of the Political Agent. I estimate, how ever, that there are at present 175 British subjects in the town, made up as follows: British 4 British Indians 22 Arabs with British nationality 21 Egyptian 1 Somalis and other Africans under British protection, about 100 Total .. .. 175 To these may be added 36 Kuwait subjects and foreigners (including the four Portuguese subjects mentioned in paragraph 3 above) in the permanent service of British subjects, who, in practice, always have been looked on as British subjects while thus employed. About 200 Indians, crews of sailing boats, pilgrims, etc., visit Kuwait annually, and, with few exceptions, the steamers which visit the port are all British ships. 8. I have not included ’Iraqis, regarding whose status I referred in my memo, randum No. 64-C., dated the 12th April 1921, under any of the above heads. I presume that they are entitled to British protection, but up to the present no ’Iraqi has applied to me for assistance as such. There is much intercourse between ’Iraq and Kuwait, and the number of ’Iraqis in the town is considerable, but, as in the case of Najdis, there is little by which one can distinguish them from the ordinary inhabitants, and it would be useless to attempt to estimate their number without actually registering them and inquiring into doubtful cases. The Sheikh of Kuwait would certainly prefer ’Iraq subjects to be under his own jurisdiction, but I do not think he is likely to prove [obstinate if the matter be pressed. Palestine and Syrian subjects, as British and French protected persons respectively, might conveniently be considered under this head. Neither are at present settled or frequently visit Kuwait, and the question would not greatly interest the Sheikh. 9. I presume from the wording of the draft Order in Council that there is no intention of asking the Shaikh of Kuwait to agree to His Majesty’s Government exercising jurisdiction with respect to the subjects of non-Christian powers refer red to in paragraph 6 above. I am of opinion that to do so would almost certainly lead to friction with the Shaikh of Kuwait, without proportionately increasing British trade or prestige and that it would therefore not be in our interests to do so, unless, or until, any of the Rulers or Governments concerned request us to do so, or wish to establish Consuls of their own. If I be right in this assumption, I would suggest that the word “ Muslim ” might be substituted for “ non-Chris tian ” in the definition of a “ Kuwait subject ” referred to in paragraph 2 above, and that the Shaikh of Kuwait be definitely asked to agree to the exercise of juris diction by His Majesty’s Government in respect of all “ foreigners,” which latter term would then include the classes enumerated in paragraph 3 above, together with any European, American, Japanese or Chinese, steamers which might at any time visit the port. As, in practice, this would mean little more than recognising British jurisdiction with respect to the members of the American Mission, I think he would readily agree to it as also he would in the case of Kuwait subjects in the regular service of British subjects of foreigners, on the conditions laid down in sub section 3 of paragraph 8 of the draft Order in Council. 10. As I am certain that, in practice, the Shaikh would not deal with Americans or the Portuguese subjects (even if he knows that the latter are not British sub jects) without reference to me, I see no immediate urgency for the Order in Council being passed. «(25) Letter from the Hon’ble Lieut.-Colonel A.

(3) Where a person is in possession of a valid British passport, the Political Agent shall, on the first registration of any such person, endorse without further fee than that provided for in sub-article (0) here under on the passport a certificate of registration in such form as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State. Where ary such person applies for the renewal of the registration and produces his passport, the renewal of. the registration shall, without further fee than that provided for in sub-article (6) hereunder be endorsed thereon. . (4) Every person who has not previously been registered applying to be registered under this Order shall, unless excused by the Political Agent, attend personally for that purpose at the Political Agency, but any person applying for the renewal of his registration need not attend personally unless directed by the Political Agent so to do, provided that the registration of the wife or wives of a man who is registered under this Order may, if living with him, be effected without their personal attendance being required, and provided also that the registration of minors, being his relatives in whatever degree, living with the head of a family who is registered under this Order, may be effected without their personal attendance being required. (5) A person registered in any register of British subjects established under the provisions of any Order in Council which have been repealed shall be registered under the provisions of this Order, unless the Poli tical Agent is satisfied after enquiry that the previous registration was erroneous or that such person is not entitled to registration under the provisions of this Order. (6) Every person shall, on every registration of himself and on every re newal of the registration, pay a fee of one rupee or such other fee as the Secretary of SP.te from time to time appoints. The amount•5* MC683FD—25-11 -24—7—-IPS 5 2 of the fee may be uniform for all persons, or may vary according to the position and circumstances of difierent classes, if the Secretary of State from time to time so directs, but may not in any case exceed 3 rupees. (7) Where any person applies to be registered, he shall be entitled without a fee, to the assistance of the Political Agent in the preparation of any affidavit that may be required. • (8) The Political Agent may require the production of such evidence that an applicant for registration is entitled to the status of a British sub ject as he may see fit, but subject to such directions as may be issued by the Secretary of States (9) If any British subject neglects to obtain registration under the provisions of this Order, he shall not be entitled to be recognised or protected as a British subject within the limits of this Order, and shall be liable to a fine not exceeding 25 rupees for each instance of Such failure, but he shall although not registered, be subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts established by the Principal Order.I .

If this be the meaning,please God I will not oppose His Majesty's Order in Gouncil. I must make an exception in the ase of these 'emnloyed' Kuwait subjects, however, as I think that if any case arise between one of these 'employed' Kuwait subjects &amp; another Ku wait subject it should be decided by me,as both are my subject and most Kuwait decisions follow the Seligeous Law of Islam In oases between Employed' Kuwait subject* and other Foreign subjects, however, there is no objection to the Political Agent hearing and deciding them* C But Arabs, and Musllvs, and other peoples who are not subjects of any Foreign Govemaent if Involved a in any case w lth a Kuwait subject, it will be decided by me as in the past but if in a case with a British Subject, employed person, or Subject of a Foreign Power, the Political Agent will deal with the case. This seemsl suitable for the present, and It is ay earnes hope that His Majesty’s Govemaent continue their favours ,and that our friendly relations increase by your help.

With reference to Your Excellency's letter of yesterday's date, I regret that my letter No.G42 dated the 6th Rabi II 1J44 was not clear to Your Excellency, and that, even after our conversation on Wednesday evening. Your Excellency still seems to entertain some doubts as to the real object* of the Order-in-Council which has been Issued.I am accordingly repeating the main points in other words, and I hope that thi-B by doing so I will remove these doubts. the first pl^ce X wish to maice It perfectly clear that that the powers conferred on me by this Order-in-Council iaxtiue do not extend to the subjects of any Muslim Government such as Persians, Najdis, etc., all of whom are considered tor the purpose ax jurisdiction as the same as Your Excellen cy's own subjects. The only Foreigners with whom I am in any way concerned are the subjects and protected‘persons of non -Muslim Govern ments, such as American^, France, Italy, Portugal, etc., and in their case if any question should arise I am sure Your Sxcellency would prefer that it should be dealt with by the i tauive or H.M. Government To reiterate: The powers donferred on me do extend to: (a) British subjects^and protected persons. vo) Tne subjects and protected persons of non-Muslim Foreig: Governments M Kuwait employed oy British subjects or the subjects of non-Muslim Foreign Governments. Such people musti am sure yc W ^’*' ce ' oe considered as under the protection of MIS MAJESTY '3 Government. It is laid down in the Order-in-Counci however that if a Kuwait subject desires to institute a complaint against a British subject or the subject of a non Ku.U. , „„ , Uh „ tB&lt; oi&gt;a jn ^ ^ court,»r i. Both ar. Hu.li.a w .. &gt;hiv . to the Qadhi for decision - iinll.. c -a reppesentafiive to ree,proceedings. Similarly if British subject or the subject of a non-Muslim Foreign Government complains against a Kuwait subject, I shall ask Your Excellency to decide the case, and it is specially provided that employed Kuwait /be / as other subjects shall/dealt with in the same way/Kuwait subjects in this respect.IXXK In cases in which Kuwait subjects and employed Kuwait subjects are concerned, however, £fcxi.&amp;x&amp;x*£x as the latter are under British protection for the time being I think you will agree that they have to have the same privelege in this respect as other British subjects, and, as shown above, they lose no privileges as Kuwait subjects. I think the above will remove the doubts from your mind and show you that the Grder-in-dounoil will ndt injure the rights of anyone, and I shall be grateful if you will let me know ixxixyjsM whether this is so.

On my return from recess I approached the Shaiich of Kuwait regarding the delegation of Jurisdiction over foreigners by him to His Majesty's Government in accordance with paragraph 8 (£) of the Kuwait Order in Council. From the first he raised no objection tc this in so far as the foreigners referred to in the Order are concerned. He was not quite satisfied at first, however, as to the 'Foreigners” really were, and at first he also did not like the idea of the powers conferred by the Order extending to Kuwait subject* w in the service of British subjects or Foreigners, in accord ance with paragraph 8 (5). After further coxisiderable exolans.- tions, however, both verbal and written, he has now written to me in a letter of to-day's date that he now understands what ie meant, and withdraws his objections. Until the Shaikh had withdrawn all his objections, I considered that it would be hardly courteous to exhibit the Order in Council, but am now doing so with effect from to-da^ Political Agent, Kuwait.\ T 0*373/S2/U Political Agency^ Dated* the 5th Noveraber 192 5 To The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Hesifient in the Persian ^ulf, B US H I P&gt; E.

Letter dated 17th Rabi II 1344 (4.11.25) from the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Political Agent, conveyed the former’s oonsent to the exercise by the latter of jurisdiction over the subjects and protected persons in Kuwait, of all Iton-Hoslem Foreign Powers. This was further amplified in the exchange of letters between the Political Agent and the Shaikh, forwarded under cover of Political Agent, Kuwait’s memorandum No.424/32/11 dated 12th December 1925 to the Resident, Persian Gulf, (see Order in Council File - U on-confidentA&amp;l )• 2. The above is entirely satisfactory, vis a vis the Shaikh, who has ceded to His Majesty’s Govern ment the ri$it as far as he is concerned of jurisdiction over foreigners of all Non-Moslem Powers - but under section Q (2) of the Order in Council His Majesty’s Government makes the proviso that the Political Agent’s jurisdiction extends over foreigners (Non-Moslem) whose respective Governments have agreed with His Majesty’s Govern ment for,or consented to, the exencise of such jurisdiction by His Majesty. 3. Hence it seems to the writer of this note that in an eventuality, such as an ^unerican Missionary etc. getting into trouble in Kuwait, the Political Agent could take cognisance of the case and exercise his jurisdiction, if he tho&gt; ght fit, seeing that the Shaikh has ceded such jurisdiction On the other hand he would equally be justified, if it was not convenient for him to take up the case, to refuse to do so on the excuse that there was no agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the United States of -amerioa in the matter. 4. In actual practice and so long as the Order in Council remains as it is, it would seem incumbent on the Political Agent always $o take up the cudgels on behalf of Americans or any other foreigners (Non-Moslem) v/ho happened to get into trouble, with the Shaikh^ of Kuwait or his subject This for the sake of European prestige if for nothing else. 5.

Notwithstanding, in any case triable by a subordinate Magis trate under Chapters XVI to XXIII inclusive of the Indian Penal Code if both the complainant and defendant are Muhammadans and are acquiescent in such procedure, the Political Agent may order the case to be tried by a Qazi, a representative from the Agency attending to record briefly the proceedings. In such suits the judgment passed by the Qazi shall not be carried into effect until it is ratified by the Political Agent, and the Political Agent shall have power to revise the finding and sentence as if the Qazi were a subordinate Magistrate, or to return the case for retrial to the same or another Qazi.

The Chief Court may, where it appears so expedient, by warrant under the hand and seal of the Political Resident, cause the accused to be sent for trial to Bombay accordingly. The warrant shall be sufficient authority fo any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named and to carry him to and deliver him up at Bombay, according to the warrant.

(2) In the case of any offence committed on the high seas or within the Admiralty jurisdiction by any person who at the time of committing such offence was on board a British ship, or by any British subject on board a foreign ship to which he did not belong, the Court shall, subject to the provisions of this Order, have jurisdiction over such person as if the offence had been committed within its jurisdiction.

                           Kuwait Order in Council(1925) and the subsequent issue of supporting King‘s Regulations by the Persian Gulf Political Resident:
                           The Indian Pilgrim Ships Regulation(1926) and
                           Indian Succession Regulation(1927). It therefore contains drafts proposals and correspondence between British officials concerning proposed revisions, and the extent to which it should be based on the Orders in Council for Bahrain and Muscat.The file also contains correspondence debating whether a separate Order in Council for Kuwait is required, and if so how urgent this requirement is. This debate is undertaken in the context of proposals for a single Order in Council for the entire Persian Gulf, and the possibility that Kuwait may come under the authority of Mesopotamia as part of the post-war settlement. The extent that Britain is able to assume authority over non-British and non-Muslim subjects (e.g. Americans and Europeans) is also discussed within the file.The main correspondents are as follows: the Kuwait Political Agent (Daniel McCollum and James Carmichael More); the Persian Gulf Political Resident (Arthur Trevor and Francis Beville Prideaux); the High Commissioner for Iraq (Sir Percy Cox); the Foreign Department of the Government of India; and officials of the Colonial Office, the India Office, and the Foreign Office.The Arabic content in the file consists of an exchange (see folios 113-127) between the Kuwait Political Agent and the Shaikh of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah [Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ]. This correspondence is dated 24 October and 3 November 1925; it concerns the publication of the
                           Kuwait Order in Counciland queries from the Shaikh as to the extent of British authority over foreigners; it includes English translations.Draft copies of the
                           Kuwait Order in Councilcan be found on folios 83-92, while copies of the published version can be found on folios 96-102 and 139-52. A draft of the
                           The Indian Pilgrim Ships Regulationmay be found on folios 158-59, and the final version can be found on folio 163. A copy of the final
                           Indian Succession Regulationcan be found on folio 187.A wax seal — possibly a Foreign Office seal — is affixed to folio 136.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Kuwait Order in Council</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000148#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
