Sir, In continuation of my letter of the 18th February 1915, No. P.458, as to the Bahrain Order in Council I am directed to invite a reference to the Government of India's Secret letter No. 42 dated the 8th May 1915, recommending Copy commubicated to Foreign Office i that the Political 28th May 1915. I Resident in the Per sian Gulf and the Political Agent, Bahrain, should be invested with Jurisdiction for the spheres of their respective Orders in Council, viz:- (l) the Persian Coast and Islands, and (2) Bahrain, to deal with and try Slave Trade cases. The IXarquess of Crewe desires to commend this proposal to the favourable consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. As regards the position of the Political Agent, Maqqat, which was discussed in your letter No. 1424 of the ?5rd Feb ruary last, Sir E. Grey will have learned from the Viceroy 1 s telegram of the 29th March that the Government of India have Copy communicated to Foreign I under their consideration Office 29th March 1915. { the revision of the Masqat Order in Council, and that a communication on the subject may shortly be expected from them. The question of Masqat can, however, be taken up separately when the promised communica tion has been received; and meanwhile there seems no reason why, if Sir E. Grey concurs, steps should not be taken at once to give effect to the Government of Indian proposals in regard to the Persian Coast and Islands and to Bahrain. A copy of Sir P.

I have etc. T.W. Holderness. The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office. Enclosure No. 2: No.'26,740. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 10th ultimo on the subject of slave Trade jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a Memorandum whi^h has been pre- pared in this Department indicating what appears to him to be the legal difficulty in giving that jurisdiction to the Persian Coast Court and the Bahrain Court. I am to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive r the observations of the Marquess of Creweon this paper. I am etc Louis Mallet. The Under Secretary of State for India. Annex. Slave Trade Jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf. The desire of the India Office, as expressed in their letter of 10th June 1915, is that in the Persian Gulf the Political Resident, and in Bahrain the Political Agent should - Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, 21st July 1915.should be given jurisdiction to deal with and try slave trade cases. I am not clear that such jurisdiction can be conferred upon an extra-territorial Court. Under the Slave Trade Act 1875, Section 5,- a Vice- Admiralty Court in Eer Majesty^ Dominions has slave ^rade jurisdiction. Similar jurisdiction is conferred upon the Court at Masqat as the joint result of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act of the same year and the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1879, and the Masqat Order in Council, 1867, Article 29. The Slave Trade (East Sfrican Courts) Act, 1875 confers upon w an East Afr ican Court w the slave trade juris- * diction of a Vice-Admiralty Court in Eer Ma.jesty^ possess ions abroad, and the Act of 1879 brings the Masqat Court within the definition of East African Court if jurisdiction in relation to the slave trade is conferred upon it by Order rin Council passed before or after the passing of that Act. At that date therefore, it would appear that jurisdiction in slave trade cases could not have been validly conferred upon a Consular Court in the Persian Gulf outside Masqat.' Under Section 2 (l) of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty 'Act 1890 certain courts .became Colonial Courts of the Ad miralty, and have under Section 2 (2) and (2) the same j'uriodiction as the High Court of Admiralty in England, and as a Vice-Admiralty Court under any Imperial Act or Colonial Law, except that in matters relating to the slave trade their jurisdiction is that of a Vice-Admiralty Court, and not of the High Court. If the language of Sub-section (5) of Section 2 is looked at carefully (' any enactment referring to a the Imperial Vice-Admiralt3 r Court .... contained in an Act of/Parlia ment .... shall apply ^bo a Colonial Court of Admiralty t m and be read as if Colonial Court of Admiralty were substitu ted for 'V.ice-Admiralty Court * H ) the effect would appear to be only to confer on Colonial Courts of Admiralty, in Her Majesty's possessions , jurisdiction under the Slave ^ Trade tIT Trade Act of 1875, 'becauBe after such substitution of words is made as directed above, the words in the Slave Trade Act of 1875, Section 5, 'in Her Majesty's Dominions out of th e United Kingdom 11 would continue to appear. •5 If this is the correct construction. Section 12 of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty, 1890, does not seem to help. That section provides that an Order in Couhcil may direct that the Act, subject to the conditions, exceptions, and qualifications, if any, contained in the Order, shall apply to any extra-territorial court as if the Court were a Colonial Court of Admiralty. The application of 'the Act' to the consular courts in the Persian Gulf would not get rid of the limitation existing under the legislation of 1875 that to be qualified to exer cise slave trade Jurisdiction a court must either be in His Majesty^ dominions or be an East African Court. Some confirmation of this view is afforded by the language of Section IB of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, which deals with rules for procedure in slave trade matters re 'in Colonial Courts of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty Courts in the exercise of their Jurisdiction in matters relating to s ^he slave trade, &gt; a.nd in and from East African Courts as defined by the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1875 and 1879'. This language loolcs as if the East African Courts must ^till o trace their slave trade jurisdiction to the special Acts re lating' to it, and not to their Admiralty jurisdiction as i Colonial Courts of Admiralty. Under the constructions of these various Acts indicated above is correct, the effect of Article 29 of the Persian Coast and Islands Order, 1907,and corresponding provisions in other Orders would seem to be that slave tra.de jurisdiction was en|oyed by the courts under that Order until the Foreign Jurisdiction Admiralty Order in Council, 1910, Article 4 (4) b took it away again; and it certainly was not the]z( intention o \ of th&lt;w=Drder of 1910 to diminish or curtail the existing jurisdiction of any of the Courts referred to. a EnclosureEnclosure No. 5:- India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 6th August 1915. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st July, No. 86,740, enclosing copy of a memorandum regarding the legal difficulty in giving Slave Trade jurisdiction to the Persian Coast Court and the Bahrain Court. 9 In reply I am to state that the Marquess of Crewe agrees that in order to exercise such Jusri^diction acourt must either be in His Majesty's dominions or be an East Afri can Court within the meaning of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act of 1875. The Slave Trade (East African) Act of 1879 expressly constitutes the Masqat Court an East African Court, and as the Masqat Order in Council gives that Court Slave Trade jurisdiction, no difficulty exists so far ss the Masqat Court is concerned. With reference however to the view taken in the Memorandum that in 1879 such jurisdiction could not have been validly * conferred upon a consular court in the Persian uulf outsidr© Masqat, and to the doubt expressed whetherp it can be con ferred upon an extra-territorial court, his Lordship is ad vised that the Act of 1875 appears expressly to contemplate .the conferring 6f jurisdiction where there is an existing East African Slave Trade Treaty with a foreign State on the shores of the Persian Gulf or in any island lying off Arabia, or where there may be a future treaty to that effect. He admits that in the absence of an East African Slave Tr de Treaty, in respect of Bahrain or the Persian Conet and Jal'-ir.ds the provisions of Section 7 of the Act do not apply, and the power under that section to confer jurisdiction on the res pective Courts cannot be exercised; and he therefore thinks it desirable that this impediment should be removed, if - possible, by the conclusion of new Slave Trade Treaties. As regards Bahrain, I aip to observe that the Treaty of 10 thMb 7 Aitchison's Treaties, Vol XII, p. 158. jj 10th May 1855 with the Shaikh^ predecessor is still in force. If Sir E. Grey concurs in the proposal, his Lordship will address the Boverrunent of India with a view to the negotiation of a new treaty with the Shaikh. I am to enquire whether, as regards the Court of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Sir E, Grey considers that the negotiation of a similar treaty with Persia 4s practicable. I have etc. T.W. Holderness. The^Under Secretary of State Foreign Office. -a Rnclosure No. 4:- Foreign Office to Iridia Office. Foreign Office, 24th October 1915. No. 44,599. Sir, I am directed ty Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter P.29^0 of the 6th of August regarding the legal difficulty in giving slave trade jurisdiction to the Persian Coast Court and the Bahrain Court. As regards Persia Sir E. Grey concurs in the view of the Marquess of Crewe that His Majesty's Government can act under the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act of 1875 if a slave trade treaty with Persia exists subsequent to that date.- The Anglo-Persian Treaty of 2nd March 1882 is of the above- mentioned character, and was, by the Order in Council of Gth . August 1882, ordered to be deemed to be an existing sl^ve trade-treaty within the meaning of the Slave Trade Act, 1875. It appears, however, that no Order in Council has been enacted with reference to this treaty, under Section 7 of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act 1875, and in these circumstance . S ! it „ J *1T' A « « appears to Sir E. Gr©y that the most convenient court# will be to pass an Order in Council under Section 7 of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1875 (a) directing that the treaty shall be deemed to be -n existing East African slave trade treaty within the meaning of the Act; (b) authorizing the Court of the Political Resident at Bushire to exercise jurisdiction in matters relating to the slave trade; and (c) directing that the Court shall exercise the jurisdiction conferred on the East African Courts by the Slave Trade (East African Courts? Act of 1873. be Sir E. Grey is advised that all these points can/provided for in the same Order in Council. I am therefore, to propose Subject to the concurrence of Lord Crewe, that action should be taken in the above sense. As regards Bahrain, Sir E. Grey agrees with the view of his Lordship that a new Treaty with the Shaikh of Bahrain will be required before a similar Order in Council can be enacted. Sir E. Grey understands, however, that suhh a treaty could probably be concluded without serious difficulty, and in giew of the fact that the want of slave trade jurisdic tion is felt principally at Bahrain, Sir E. Grey concurs in his Lordship's suggestion to address the Government of India with a view (bo the negotiation of a new treaty with the Shaikh of Bahrain. I am etc. Eyre A.

The draft in ueption has been based on the Treaty with Muscat and the Convention with Persia 1PRP. &gt;y herve prepared the draft vrith some diffidence,as ry knowledge on the various diplomatic and legal ruestions involved in Slave Trade Treaties and the juristlction bared thereon is very s^all. A formal Ireaty is,I believe,a docunent ripned by the properly accredited representatives of the Powers concerned. If this is so,and if a formrl reaty of this type is retired,my draft does not satisfy the retirements of the case. I have made the draft on the lines of previous engage ments entered into by the rhailrhsof Bahrein and Oman and other parts of the Gulf.

I am not ij-te certain whether it would be advisable to put in the portion of clause 5 which I have put in brackets,but I thinl that the prerent practice.of manumitted slaves being under out protection should be confirmed.

Folios 1b-11 are a letter dated 28 January 1914 (with enclosures dating back to June 1913) from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (John Lorimer) to the Political Agent in Bahrain (Major Arthur Trevor). The letter refers to a proposal from the India Office in London, that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent in Bahrain be given legal jurisdiction in slave trade cases arising in the Gulf. A number of the enclosures included with the letter are memoranda exchanged between officials in the India Office and Foreign Office in London, noting the legal difficulties in providing jurisdiction over the slave trade in the Persian coast and Bahrain courts, because neither are in His Majesty’s dominions, or are an East African court, which already had jurisdiction in slave trade matters (folio 8).To circumvent these difficulties, a new slave trade treaty with the Shaikh of Bahrain was proposed, under instruction from the Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey. Drafts of the new treaty (in English and Arabic, folios 15-18), which was in part based on the 1873 Slave Trade treaty with Muscat and the 1882 Slave Trade Convention with Persia, were forwarded by Trevor to the Resident in March 1914.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
