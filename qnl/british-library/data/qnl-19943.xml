Bear Walton, Many tha iks for your letter No.P.Z.6519/31, of October 27th, regarding the desirability of arranging for the exmination of historical arguments in connexion with the Persian claim to Bahrein. We note that all the relevant papers in the lovernment of India's archives are available in the India Office and can be produced at a moment 1 s notice. This is satisfactory, so far as it goes. We had not, however, originally intended to suggest the desirability of undertaking at the present stage an examination of the India Office records. Such an examination will probably add little or nothing to our knowledge of the history of Bahrein prior to 1783, as set forth in oaragraphs 3 and 4 of Sir A.Chamberlain's note of February 18th, 1929, to the Persian Minister in London. What we had in mind was rather an examination by some well qualified expert in oriental languages and history into the early history of the islands, by means of research in tte works of certai n Moslem and other historians, especially of those who are likely to be quoted by the Persian Government in support of their thesis that Bahrein always was in Persian possession before 1783, except during the Portuguese occupation from 1507 to 1622. We/ ONCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER | ilton Esq., C.B., M.C., ^ D ; ' &amp;.C.1331 tndia Office, S. W. 1. M 8 ORETARY, POLITICAL AND !We are advised by our Legal Advisers that, if and when the Persian claim to Bahrein is examined by a tribunal such as the Permanent Court of International Justice, the representative in charge of our case, however certain he may feel that events subsequent to 1783 in fact destroy the Persian claim whatever the position before that date may have been, will nevertheless insist on being supplied with full information as to what we conceive to be the true history prior to 1783. In a case of this kind he would not be prepared to make any admission whatever, even with regard to a matter which he thought was really irrelevant, unless he were certain that the admission was one which the actual facts of the case forced us to make. Consequently it will certainly be necessary for us sooner or later to have the results of an investigation by a competent Eastern historian into the earlier history of the islands. We think that the time has come when we must recognise that in all probability the Persian claim will ultimatelv have to be settled by a Judicial decision. We have for some time been trying to get it settled by a treaty in which Persia! was to have given up her cldm in return for such advantages as we were prepared to offer. The Persians, however, have demanded absurd compensation v: as the price of the surrender of their claim, and it is probable that they have deluded themselves by means of their own propaganda into believing that Bahrein has a greater value as a bargaining counter than we shall ever be prepared to admit. We very much doubt, in brief, if the Persians will ever agree to abandon their claim in return for what we may be willing to offer. Sooner or later, therefore, if the claim is ever to be settled at all, we shall probably be forced to agree to a judicial settlemait;/ :•.Mr settlement; and we shall not be able to leave it unsettled indefinitely, for the forthcoming arrival in the Crulf of the Persian Navy renders it unlikely that we shall be able for much longer simply to ignore the Persian pretensions as we have done in the past. • I3 - If then arbitration of some sort is sooner or later inevitable, circurastaiices may well arise, (possibly in connexion with the activities of the new Persian warships], in which we should wish to be able to call the Persian bluff and ask for a judicial decision ourselves. Before we do this, however, we must have our material readv. The real question now to be decided is whether there is any object to be gained by further postponing the prooosed investigation by an oriental historian. If you are able to advance any convincing reasons to show that it will be best to postpone action for the present, we shall be quite prepared to reconsider the situation in the light of your views. To us, however, there seems to be a case for going ahead with the proposal at once, particularly as the anti-British campaign of last year regarding Bahrein in the Tehran press, which was obviously directly inspired by the Persian Government, has given us a valuable indication of the authorities whom they are likely to quote in support of their contentions. lours, &amp;C., (Sgd.) o.w.13/150 &amp; 19/191.

I had 3 hours today with minister of Court and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who hardly spoke. They professed the greatest desire to reach immediate settlement. Conversation was very discursive. So far as can be judged from first contact all should be easy provided we can settle Bahrain. On this subject Persians' views are that they have a claim which can be disposed of either by reference to some tribunal or by negotiation. They maintain that if we both prefer negotiation it is purely waste of time for me to say that Persian claim depends chiefly on value attached to it by claim. I regard this as common sense. I think I convinced them that we will not do deal over Tamb at expense of Shaikh. Being satisfied that something territorial is what they want I asked whether they had ever thought of suggesting compensation elsewhere. Minister at once mentioned 3hatt-al-Arab. I said he seemed to think that we always satisfied claims at expense of third parties. «*e talked round issue and eventually Minister indicated that Persian claim in Shatt-al-Arab could be satisfied by Tripartite Conservancy Board. I thought this would be in harmony with views of His lajesty's Government. During Telegram; Froms To Repeated;-2- During this part of conversation I tried to get Minister to admit that we had urged Persian Government to say what they wanted in Shatt -al»Arab (apart from unpracticable far-fetched rectifi cation), At the end of interview Minister said he wanted to invite Humphrys here in March and he was sure Shah waild like to see him. I welcomed this, adding th. t, as a matter of fact, I was hoping to receive a visit from him about end of February, To return specifically to Bahrain I submit for consideration two possible lines of approach (1) a frontier rectification of Baluchistan if something innocuous can be found (2) clause in Treaty by which Persia, while reserving right to submit issue to arbitration, will meanwhile give Bahrainion basis of reciprocity rights described in our draft Treaty and exemption from military service. If relations remain friendly after Treaty question would die? if raised after Treaty arbitra tion would be relatively innocuous. Henjam was then touched on. If Persia makes difficulties I will submit views for your consideration. Debts and Residency. Minister appears to think that we have surrendered on both points. If I think it good tactics I shall be highly qoi polemical about them. Imminent. Visits. I think I convinced him that he has been fussing about nothing material. 'Memeet a^ain on February 16th.

(II) Persians have given so much publicity to their claim that I do not see how they can climb down without large and equally public quid pro quo. If I understand Minister's proposal rightly it amounts to agreement to differ but to maintain status quo with decent treatment for Bahrainis in Persia. In the circumstances this seems best way out of difficulty if we can get Persians to accept it.

Article by Saeed TTafiey : TS0YEREIG1TY I1T BAKESIH SI1CS 1700 YEiRS AGO. If we had from the Ashkanian. and llakamaneshian dynasties the same written documents that we have from the of the sassanian Kings, we could probably prove that from the very beginning of the rule of the Persians in this country, the Bahrein islands have always been under Persian sovereignty and that no other nation has ever claimed them. During the rei^i of the Qajar dynasty, hov/ever, when their incapacity gradually retrenched parts of our country, we see that others have opened their eyes of greed these islands. Lacking such documents, we have only to keep satisfied with the history of the last 1700 years which elucidate the history of these islands in the eyes of the civil ised world of the present day which formulates all inter-relations between various countries on the basis of international equity and arbitration. After the Great War, the claims of all defeated and victorious nations over various territories were des.lt with on the basis of historical and ancient documents and evidence of unity of race, language, religion and civilisationo All states now formed in Asia and Surope out of the division or dissolution of other countries have only gained their autonomy or new territories with such arguments and thanks to such logic. But was there any Government which was abUe to produce such a cogent proof or title deed dating back some 1700 years in support of its claim - a document which bore such illustrious historical names and signatures ? The oldest record that we can find of the history of Bahrein is in the book written by Muhammad ben Jarir Tabari one of the most reliable Hussulman historians who writesn -2- writes tkat during tiie reign of the Aslikanian Kings, the irabs were all in the Hejaz, Badieh, Mecca and Yemen; that bad harvests reduced those who were in Badieh to a lamine jirom which they fled to Bahrein,then under Persian rule, as they could not go to 'Iraq., as they feared the Ashkanians. The freat French orientalist, Coussin de Pereival, has studied the Arah history after mentioning this information, and expresses the opinion that this event happened in 190 AoD. that is to say 1742 years ago, when the Ashkanian Kings ruled over the Bahrein islands. The next mention that we can find ahout Bahrein, is in the 'book 'Aghani' hy Abul Far a;) Isfahani, first edition, paragraph II, pages 161 and 162, which states that some Arab families reached the Hejr region in Bahrein and the inhabitants of that region having opposed entry into their territory a fight ensued which ended with the victory of the Arabs who ) ' | 1 HH § ^ entered and lived in Bahrein, A legend is then mentioned by the writer of the book which explains the name of Tanukh ( The next record of Bahrein is from Tabari ?/ho says that there was a King in Bahrein named Sajuruq ( during the reign of King Ardeshir Babakan who owned a strong fortress which was occupied by Ardeshir after one year T s surrounding® Ardeshir conveyed to Persia all the treasures possessed by that King in Bahrein and appointed his own son Shahpur as the Governor of Bahrein in whom he invested the sovereigaty of the islands, Eamadullah Mustofi states in the 'Tarikh-i-Guzideh', page 105 that Ardeshir Babakan reigned in Persia from 212 to 225 A .D. and built a town in Bahrein which formed a part of his realm, Ebn-i-Balkhi states in the 'Fars-nameh', pages 6o - 61, that Ardeshir Babakan built the town 'Khat' { ) whichI? -3- which was the capital town of Bahrein. During the reign, of Shalipur Zol-Aktaf, a Sassanian King, from 310 to 379 A.I)., the Arabs resident in Bahrein who were Persian subjects, according to Sir Arnold Wilson in the 'Persian Gulf' revolted against Persian rule in Hejr { ^ ) and Shahpur defeated them 'by a naval fight which after the naval fight Sanakhrib ( ^) forms the earliest naval action recorded in history. Ebn-i-Balkhi says {page 68) that Shahpur went to meet the Arabs with his fleet and re-gained the islands from the latter; went to the island 'iChat' and thence to Bahrein, Hejr and Yamameh { S ^ ). He says on page 69 that he quartered the Bani Thaalab Arabs in Barein ( ) and Khat which form dependencies of Bahrein. Sir Arnold Wilson writes again {page 85) about this fight of Shahpur that he landed in Ghatif { ) where be beheaded a number of the Bahrein rebels, recaptured Hejr and annihilated the majority of the Tribe Abdul Ghais and then assaulted lamih) { ^ ). The Bahrein islands formed parts of the Persian Empire so long as the Sassanian Kings ruled in Persia -of whom we may cite Khusrow Parviz, who reigned from 590 to 627 A.I). Colman Hovard, the French Orientalist, writes in his Arab History, Yolume 1 page 150, that the Prophet sent in the year 7 of the Eijpa era (628 A.B.) an emissary to Bahrein inviting Manzar ben Savi { )of the Abdul Ghais tribe, who then governed Bahrein on behalf of the Sassanian rulers to embrace Islam; he then says (pages 172-173) that Manzar accepted Islam and that there was a 'Marzeban' {a sort of sheriff) named Assb-i-Takht at that time in He^r which formed the capital of Bahrein representing the Sassaniai rulers. Ali ben Musa ben Saad states in the 'Sireh-i-Rassul' that the name of this man was Yassi Baiait.ijwf ijp.-4- in 'Fatuh-iil-Buldaji' and Yagut in 'imajam-ul-Buldop ,T state that Manzar embraced Islam and agreed to pa^ the 'Zakat'; ■but when a regular tax was demanded, the Bahrein population abandoned Islam so that at the time of the death of Manzar there was no Mussulman in Bahrein. f fhe writer of tke 'Tarikh-i- Guzideh' says in page 147 that the Governor of Bahrein embraced islam in the year 8 of the Hi^ra (629 Ao.B. )• Charles Schauffer, the French Orientalist, states on page 230 of the Commentary he wrote on the (Travel narrative of Naser Khusrow fhat the name of the Bahrein 'Marzeban' was Sspiduh; it is at any rate quite evident that there was then a Governor in Bahrein representing the Sassanian Kings® 111 other writers have written that the Prophet sent Ala ben Abdullah lOiazrami to occupy Bahrein. Yaqut says in 'Mua;)am-ul~Buldan' that Ala invited the inhabitants to embrace Islam; that all of the Arabs and some of the Persians in Bahrein accepted the new religion but that the people of the towns composed of ^ews. Christians and Zoroastrians made their peace witk Ala and the Zoroastrians paid a tribute in money to the prophet. it is evident that the Bahrein population was composed at the outset of the islamic invasion of Arabs and Persians; the collection of the Treaties of Great Britain with Persia and the book 'The Persian Gnlf'^ make hints to this end and the writer of the latter states that the old inhabi tants of the Bahrein Islands are believed to be composed of Persians and Arabs. The religions of the islands during the reign of the Sassanians were zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian and the Arahs generally belonged to the latter two* The He^r town, the capital of Bahrein was well known in old Persia and there is an old saying in Persian which says in the case of an unnecessary and superfluous action 'to take dates to-6- to He^r rt . fiie names of the villages in Bahrein mentioned in the 'Fars-nameh-i-Fassayi' (Yolnme 2 page 180) vvhich are quoted hereunder are mostly Persians and form another proof in support of the fact that these islands always 'belonged to fersia: Boori ( (/^), foobly { ), Deraz ( ^ ), Dane stan ( (i^ ), Sar ( ' ), Shakhvar ( ), Farsieh { ), Karaneh ( ), Karzagan ( Markh ( )» Marvazan { Uj^y ) and Havidarat ( ) of whieh the Persian origins are evident• fti 1 the Arab historians who wrote the early history of Islam have mentioned that the first region of Persia whiofc was converted and possessed by islam, was Bshrein and this shows that Bahrein was definitel^ecognised at that time as Persian* &amp;min Reihani the contemporaneous Arab writer states in hus Kaluk-ul-Arab, Volume 2, pages 178-250, that Bahrein was a Persian dependency in the early years of islam; that the inhabitants were Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians and that Manzar ben Savi was Governor of the place having his commission from Persian KingSo From Issue Ho, 1686 of the Itela-at of August 24th 1932. 'Continuation of article on Bahrein Colman Hovard says in Volume I page 17 , that the Arabs of Bahrein revolted against Islam in the year 12 (Hi^ra) 633 A.D. under the leadership of Manzar ben HUaman and he says on page 219 that Bahrein became a Sassanian dependency again and Abu Bakr, the Mtislim Khalif, had to send an army for the second time to the islands. The writer of the 'Tarlkh-i-Guzideh' says on pafee 168 that Ala Khazrami went to Bahrein during the Khalifate of Abu Bakr and that he fought twice a day during one9.\ -6- one montii in the town of He^r# Ebn-i-Balkhi states in 'Fars-nameh', page 113 that umar oen Khattab, the .Khalif, sent an agent to Bahrein named Ala Khazrami who was succeeded by Uthman ben Abi-el-As fhaghafi who ruled over Bahrein and Oman ( j ^ )„ Colonel Hovard states (in Volume I page 259) that during the Khali fate of Ali ben Abi Taleb from 23 to 35 Si^ra the people of Bahrein did not pay their taxes and some tribes of than reverted to Christianity. Yaqut says in the 'Mua^am-ul-Buldan' that during the Khalifate of the Rashedin Khalifs, Bahrein was a dependency of Iraq, (he means probably Persia, as this country is called by the Arabs Airaq^i^Ajam f ^ O S) translator) and that the Beni Umayeh Khalifs formed one province of Oman, Bahrein and Ysiaameh { ^ The Persians made a violent revolt against the Beni umayeh cind the Arabs and their antagonism was directed against the Arab rale rather than the Arab religion, f^ose who in many regions of Persia joined this revolt were called 'Khavare^' am and according to the book 'Mafatih-ul-Adab' of Mirza Muhaamed Ali Lhan Kababi, page 4, Abu FaH^dk: one of the Khavarej succeeded in regaining Bahrein from the Bani Umayeh Khalifs in the year 72 of the Hi^ra era# Abdul Malek ben Marvan sent an army in the year 73 and re-captured that region but another revolt headed by Massud ben Abi Zabib Abdi in lo5 Hi^ra resulted in the defeat of the Bahrein Arab agent and the reign by the rebel of 19 years in Bahrein after which he was slain by Sufyan ben Amr. in the year 151 Aghabeh ben Salim went to Bahrein as an emissary from Kansur the Abbassifie Khalif and occupied Bahrein killing Suleiman ben Hakim Abdi the Governor of that islands The year 276 records the outset of the well-known ievolt of 'Gharameteh' in Bahrein, They were the same 'Khavam■■ ii. ' § -7- 'Kiiavare^' already described, who first started their revolt against the Arabs in Bahrein, gradnally gaining root in Arabistan. According to Yaqut, the i^alls of the town Lahsa were built in Bahrein by Abu Taher ben AteiSaeed Jenabi the Khavare^ leader. !Bhe innhabitants of those regions had the religion of the 'Gharmatis' till the year 443 when Hasr Khusrow went to Bahrein and the inhabitants were certainly Persians as Ifasr' Khusrow states that All ben Ahmad a Persian had built a mosque in Lahsa for lodging travellers (Page 124). According to the 'Tarikh-i-Guzideh' page 341, the beginning of the 'Gharameteh' revolt was in the year 319: they reigned for a long time in the Persian Gulf and the coastal territories and islands&lt;&gt; It was really a Persian revolt against the Arab rulers from whom they regained some regions* After the decline of the rule of the 'Gharam^eh^ the revolt of the 'Saheb-uz-2an^ n { ) came about which was again really a Persian revolt against the Arab rule. The writer of the 'Mafatih-ul-Adab' states that the Saheb-us-Zan occupied Bahrein in 449 and sent ipany emissaries to Hejr who were able to win over to their leader a number of the leading inhabitants and to get them to revolt against the Arab Khalifs. Again according to the Tarikh-i-Guzideh R page 241, the Atabek Abu Bakr one of the Atabeks of Fars v &amp; lo reigned from 6E3 to 658 Hi^ra era, occupied Kish { ), Bahrein, Ghatif and Lahsa. The writer of ^Al Maaajam' says in the foreword to the book, page 4, where an eulogy is made of Atabek Abu Bakr; ^The country of Kish and its dependencies of the Arab territory, Vadi ( Uj ' j ) of the He^az and Bahrein etc.' as parts of the realm over which the Atabek reigned. MirzaMirza Lmhararnaa. Jaafar Khurmo^i states in 'Fars-nameli', pages 90-92, that Atabek Abu Bakr occupied Bakrein in the year 633 to which he annexed Ghatif and lahsa some 8 years after. The Government dues and taxes of those regions used to 'be sent to the Fars treasury till the end of the reign of the Atabeks in Fars viiich was up to the year 664. The writer of the Fars-nameh lasseri also states that on page 180, Vol. 2 that the above statement is correct adding that after the decline of the rule of the Atabeks, Bahrein was occupied by the rulers of' Hormuz. The writer of the 'Persian Gulf ' states on page 105 that the Horrauz Kings /C^W* « % ♦ fought for some time with the Kings &amp;£ Kish and Bahrein whom they eventually defeated. The victor was Ghutb-ed- Din the King of Hormuz (year 720-1320 A.D.). Hamdullah Mustofi states {on pages 22 and 23) in the 'Hezhat-ul-Ghulub' written in the year 740, describing the Persian Etapire, that the Bahrein islands formed parts of Persia. Describing Fars on pages 136-137 he says that the islands in the Fars Sea (the Persian Gulf) are annexed to Fars in the calculation of their Government dues; that the most important of these islands in population and area are^ (Q,ais) and Bahrein. The same writer states somemtiere lower on the same page that the Bahrein island is now a part of Fars and a dependency of Persia, in another passage, page 234, he states that there are many islands in the Oman Sea but those vtiich are well-known and v&amp;iich come under Persian rule and are well populated are Hormuz, Qais, Bahrein and Khark (Kharag). Ebn Batuteh #io started his voyages in the year 725 and vAlo was in Bahrein simult aneously, says, in page 210,Yol.I published in Egypt, that the inhabitants of those regions had the religion of the 'Rafedhis'. As it is certain that this religion b 91oag 94-9- bilonged to Persia, so the inhabitants of Bahrein v&amp;lo are described as having the same religion should certainly have been Persians. The 'Tarikh-i-Gusideh' states on page 712 that Sultan ihmad 11 Mazaffar who reigned in Pars and Kerman from 786 to 789 went to Bahrein and this shews that Bahrein was at that time under his rule, The 'Fars-nameh' of Khurmo jee x± states ±&amp;a± in the passage above-mentioned that during the reign of the Mongol Atabeks in Fars a Governor was ruling Bahrein on their behalf but that during the reign of the Gurkanieh Kings, Bahrein became occupied by the Hormuz Kings. The Encyclopaedia Britannica says in its explanation of the v/ord 'Bahrein' that Bahrein was occupied by the Portugese in 913 Hijra (1507 A.D.). The writer of 'The Persian Gulf' states on page 123 that the Portugese formed a customs station in those regions in the year 929 (1522 A.I).) but the inhabitants of Hormuz and Bahrein revolted against their exactions and the King of Hormuz made a ni^hLt assault on the Portugese of whom he killed a great number. This incident shews thal^ven during the occupation of the Portugese, not only did the Persians not consent to the Portugese rule but the Persian chieftains around Bahrein also did not consider the Portugese as lawful occupants of Bahrein. The writer of the 'Mafatih-ul-Adab' states in page 5 that the Portugese occupied Bahrein in the year 932 and kppt it for one hundred years. The writer of the 'Persian Gulf' is of the opinion (page 124) that the King of Hormuz sent a second time in 935 (1528 A.B.) an army to the Bahrein islands and onased trouble for the Portugese, The same writer states, page 126, that when the Turks performed skirmishes in the Persian Gulf during 960 (1552 A.D, ) they sent men—of—war with 12001200 men to exercise a 'blockade on Bahrein tnit tlie Portugese defeated them and these incidents are the beginnings of the pretensions of the Turks over those islands and their pretensions have always been untenable* Bie writer of the 'Montzem-i-lasseri tt Volume 2 - page 165, states Miile explaining es the events of the year 1008 that the Shah Abbas took the provinc of Lar and the regions of Bahrein. fite writer of the 'Alamara-ye-Abbassi' states on page 689 explaining the events of the year 1130 that Shah Abbas commissioned Allah Yerdi Khan, the Governor of Fars to expel the Portugese from the Persian Gulf and Bahrein was occupied in that year® From Issue Ho. 1687 of the Itela-at dated the 25th August, 1932. Persian Sovereignty in Bahrein. Serial Fo. 3o The writers of the 'Fars-nsmeh' of Khurmo^i and of Hasseri are of the opinion that under instructions from Allah Verdi Khan, Khovajeh Main-ud-Din Fali captured these islands and that the Govemorate of Bahrein was entrusted by the Persian Royal Court in Isfahan till the end of the reign of the Safavi Dynasty to Sheikh Jabareh Eowleh ( ^ a/one ' ✓ of the Arabs of Persian Lares tan. ¥fe find in the Collection of Treaties of Great Britain that Bahrein was captured by the Portugese during the time of Albyquerque and was under their rule till the year 1632 A.D.

The writer of the 'Persian Gulf' in page 245 reiterating these two points states that the exact date of the occupation of Bahrein by the Portuguese is not well known but we only know that the people of Bahrein revolted against the P0I,t isaes9 ana the p s ^, P8r3ian3 tfce year i 521 ^X521 k.3*{928 Ei4ra) and tkat they killed the Portuguese agent in the islands. The Portguese sent new men a few years after and re-captured the islands. This shews that the oeenpation by the Portuguese of Bahrein was not continual and that during their occupation the Government of the Islands was always shared 'by Persians. Lord Curzon states in his famous 'book 'Persia and the Persian problem' (page 457, paragraph E) that the history of Bahrein underwent many vicissitudes from the time of the expulsion of the Portugnese by the Persians in 1622 A.D. (1022 Hi^ra) to this date and the reason of these continual changes is that all surrounding powers anfl nations had their eyes greedily focussed on the islands, fhis shews that all other pretensions ever since, except the rights of the Persians, were unfounded. Lord Curzon then continues in his well-known manner, so popular during his lifetime, stating that ■anderneath all wars and fightings that occurred between the Arabs, Persians and the Turks, the essential object of each and all of them was the occupation of the Bahrein islands which passed into the hands of the victors sts a trophy of war but Great Britain put an end to these wanton fancies I Great Britain con cluded a treaty with Bahrein and she strove always to bring the people of Bahrein to respect its provisions, trying to protect the island against all pretensions and intrusions After the expulsion of the Portuguese, the Persians ruled in Bahrein for a long time. The same author states in page 419 - paragraph 2, that the Portuguese concluded an agreement with shah Abbas in 1625 A.D. (1035 Hijra) according to which they abandoned all of their territorial acquirements on the coasts of the Gulf, retaining only the pearl fishery quarters of theJ.1 -12- the Gulf* The Encyclopaedia Britannica states that after the expulsion of the portugaese, the Bahrein islands were always the subject of wars between the Persians and the Arabs® The writer of the Mafatih-ul-AcLab says that Bahrein was retaken from the Portuguese in 1039 Ki^ra* The writer of 'Mantazem-i-Nasseri' states on page 183, paragraph E, citing the events of the year 10^3, that the Governor of Bahrein, Sundak Sultan, came to the Court of Shah Safi and offered the latter a sword, found in those regions, which formerly belonged to Tamerlane the Gurkan# The writer of 'Mafatih-ul-Adab n adds to this story that the sword was a part of other items of the offer aid that the Goy ernor was as a result reinstated in his pes to The writer of the book 'Buheireh', Fuznni Astrabadi, states on page 586 that 'Farangan' the King of the Portugaese occupied the port of Hormuz in the year 913 Hi^ra; the ruler of the port of Jerun,#iich is another name for Hormuz, vftiose name was Sulghur Shah ben Turan Shah became a vassal to the Portuguese King and the infidels used to enjoy the upper hand over the Mussulmans until in the year 1010 Hi^ra ■when Shah Abbas sent Allah Yerdi Khan the Governor of Fars accompanied by his men and the fighting men of all of thesouthern Ports to expel the Portugaese, which they did. He adds 'in this year 1047 when I am writing this book 'Baheireh' those regions are still in occupation of the Kizilbash troops (troops of Shah Abbas) and nothing is knowo. of the future developments'# The writer of 'Mafatih-ul-Adab' states that the people of Bahrein were at their wits* end in lo?7 becaose of the extortions of Baha Khan Sultan and complained against him to the Safavi Court and Baba Khan was dismissed and replaced by-13- 'by Sultan son of Khazal Khan wiio was then at seistan in Government employ. He further adds that in 1113 Mehdi Quli Khan was dismissed from the Governorship of those regions and Ghazaq. Sultan was appointed to replace him# The writer of the 'Persian Gulf' states that during the reign of Shah Sultan Hussein (1105-1135), the King of Oman, Sultan 'baaSeif,taking advantage of the slackness of the Persian ruler, occupied Bahrein and in 1133 (1720 ) the Arats of Mascat occupied some of the Persian islands in the Gulf* But the Persian troops occupied Oman during the reign of Nadir Shah and Bahrein was also under Persian hands till the year 1198 (1783 A»3). ) vtien the Arabs of Athoobi { took it from the Persians• A little further on, on page 174, it is written that in the year 1131 (17X8 A»D») the Arabs of Mascat occupied Bahrein hut the whole population of Bahrein left their dwellings and went out of the islands and this was the last year of the Government of the Shirks in Bahrein, The same writer states on another passage, page 245, that in 1131 (1718 AoDo), Sultan hen Seif the King of Oman attacked Bahrein and held it under his rule for sometime# But towards the middle of the 18th Century, the Arabs of Howleh ( ), who had formerly paramount influence and who form the majority of the inhabitants of the islands at the present day took over the islands. But the continual strife among these Arabs made them an easy prey for the Persians who recaptured the islands soon# The Bahrein islands were, during the rei^i of the Safavi dynasty, altogether like one of the provinces of Persia, partaking of all phases of Persian culture and civil isation. The Shiah doctrines w had gained the upper hand during the reign of that dynasty in Persia enjoyed the . same supremacy in the Bahrein islands. During the occupation of-14- of Bahrein 'by the Portuguese also the islands had the Shi ah religion. Majlessi says in the 'Bahar-ul-Anvar' that Bahrein was ruled 'by a Ma.ssa.lman Goirernor appointed by the Portugaese during their occupation. It happened that the Governor was a Sunni Massulman and his Vazir was still more of a zealot in the Sunni religion. In order to get the people of the islands converted to his religion, he produced one day a pomegranate on the skin of which the names of God, the prophet and three first Khalifs of Islam appeared in relief by the natural overgrowth of the pomegranate grains underneath and maintained that this natural phenomenon was a proof of the righteousness of the Sunni religion (as the Sunnis only recogniae the first three Khalifs of Islam and the Shiahs refute their authority and regard them as impostors, translator). hermit called Muhammad ben Issa found out the sleight of hand of the Tazir and proved to the Governor that the pomegranate when young had been placed in an earthen mould on the inside of which those names had been engraved and the natural growth of the fruit was the cause of the apparent phenomenon. The people of the islands were thereupon delivered from the exactions of the Vazir. Prom the Itela-at Issue ITo. 1688 August 27^,1932. Serial Mo. 4. One of the Christian missionaries who lived in Isfahan during the reign of Shah Sultan Hussein (A.H. 1105-1135) said during the occupation of Persia by the Afghans (A.H. 1135-1142) has written a book in Latin which was subsequently translated into Turkish and afterwards from ^Turkish into Persian by Abdur Razaq. Beg Maftun Dumb all one of the literary scholars of the time of Path Ali Shaho This book is embodied in the 'Mont azem-i -Has seri'5° -15— Hasseri' and states, with reference to the Persian irmy's defeat by the Afghan, Mir 7eis, at Kandahar (page 251 and e subsequent pages, Yoltuae 2 B Mantaz#iri-i-lasseri«) that a relative of Stemad-ud-Dowleh Lagzi, by name Lutf-Ali Khan was deemed a suitable person to send to Kandahar; but he temporised until a man came complaining that the imam 4f Mascat had occupied Bahrein some years before and that he was then extending his encroachments to Bunder Abbas. Lutf-Ali Elian took at once the opportunity of avoiding the Kandahar commission by trying to go to Bahrein, #iich he thought less dangerous to his person. Some people though.t him unsuitable for the work but in the end he set out for Bahrein. IPhere was no vessel however for the conveyance of troops and provisions to Bahrein, and the Portuguese were approached with a view to hirihg some vessels from thenu in the meantime some 50,000 Kizilbash Persian troops had re ashed Bunder Abbas and been quartered on the sea coast. The Portuguese Captain brought the vessels and asked for the hire money which was enormous. Lutf-Ali Khan pondered the matter and came to the conclusion that it was inadYisable to pay such a big sum to the Portuguese Government and that Bahrein was after all not worth the money and that if the same money was paid to the Imam of Muscat: he would ■surely be ready to hand over Bahrein to Persia. The Portuguese Captain, who was disappointed at not receiving his money returned with his vessels and the Kizilbash troops returned after a time without having perform ed their errand® The writers of the Khurmo^i and Hasseri 'Fars-nameh' state in regard to the foregoing incident that sheikh Jabbareh a Howleh Arab, broke into rebellion as soon as he realised the vanishing influence of the Safavi rulers and called himself the owner of Bahrein, Subs9q. uen t;Subsequent to the date of this incident, according to the statement ot the writer of the hook 'Tarikli-i-Jahan-G-usha- yeh-lfaderi' (first print page 71) when Mohammad faghi Khan, the Beglarbeg of Fars, was allowed to return to Fars from the Mughan field, Uadir Shah gare him personally special orders for the recovery of Bahrein, \tilch had remained under the occupation of Sheikh Jabhareh for some years# On his return to Shiraz, the Beglarbeg sent ahead of him to Bahrein a Fars regiment for the recapture of the laderi fortress. s&amp;e Sheikh Jahhareh had proceeded to Mecca on pilgrimage before the arrival of the Beglarbeg^ and his lieutenant in the fortress was defeated by the Persian troops after protracted fighting, Muhammad Tagbi Khan sent to ladir Shah, the key of the fortress and received a recompense in the way of a coat of honour, Thus Bahrein became once more one of the provinces of Persia, The same writers state, after citing this incident, that Bahrein was under the governor ate of the province of Fars till the end of the reign of the zend dynasty and the beginning of the rii^i of the Q,a^ar rulers* The writer of the Khur moji 'Fars-nameh' states that the Persian Treasufey used to receive annually some 12,000 French rials equivalent to Tomans 6,000 vahich was the net income from Bahrein after the dedmction of the expenses of Government for their collectiono The writer of the Efasseri 'Fars-nameh' states that Bahrein was in the possession of sheikh Hfasr an of Bushire up to the end of the reign of the Zend rulers* The writer of 'Mafatih-ul-Adab' states on page 6 that Self the son of Sultan, the Imam of Muscat, came and ooouplecl Bahrein in ji«E*X15X and. put the inhabitants to the swcrd during the six days after his entry. In A.H.115a ifohanoad-17- 2a^ii Klian and Kalb-Ali Kiian were commissioned 'by Hadir Shah to go and expel Seif whom they killed in Muscat; after wards they appointed Sheikh Q.ais and sheikh Hasser as deputy-governors of Bahrein and these were succeeded after their death 'by Sheikh Muez,, Lord Curzcm states on page 232 of Volume 2 of his book, that towards the 'beginning of the last century (he means the eighteenth century) Sheikh Hasser, who was a notable man, acquired great wealth and remained in power till the beginning of the reign of Kerim Khan Zend {A.H. 1163-1193) and was ruler of Bahrein, Bushire and a considerable part of Bashtis- tan; he owned numerous vessels which he used for his trade with Muscat and India; he had some Arab troops and developed and improved horse-breeding in those regions® Ee left an estate worth some £2,000,000 for his son on his death. His son, who bore the same name as his father, kept on his allegiance to Lutf-Ali Khan, the Zend ruler, according to the advice of his father and helped Lutf-Ali Khan to obtain his throne, although there had been many causes of strife in former years between them. Sheikh Abdu-Fasser, the son of the second Sheikh Hasser, was the Governor of Bushire during the first part of the present century but was a weak personality and was prevailed upon and defeated by Fath Ali Shah, Wilson ssgrs on page 245 that the Arabs of Athoobi ( )gained ground in Bahrein in the year 1193 (1779 A«J)*) after the death of Kerim Khan Zend. The petty Emirs of the Persian Gulf were keeping the peace because of the fear caused among them by the prestige of Uadir Shah, but after the death of the latter they restarted their dissensions until, in the year A.H. 1198 (1783 A.D.), the AthoobiS 2 * -18- Atiioobi. tribes took possession of Bali re in witla the assistance of the Sab ah { ) tribe smen. The writer of the noolleetion of Treaties concluded, by Great Britain' states after the mention of this incident that the Athoobis have since preserved their supremacjjE in Bahrein but thej have pro fessed obedience at various times to the Government of Muscat, the Wahabis, the Turkish Government, and the Persian Govern ment* The writer of 'Mafatih-ul-Adab' states on page 6 that in the year- A.Ho 1197 there occurred a revolt between the Qatar . ' Al-i-Athoob and the people of WxSsk and Ziareh ) • Sheikh ITasser went out to fight with them but was defeated and returned to Bus hire and asked for assistance from Fars* There was disorder all over Persia at that time and the request was neglected. Ahmad ben Mohammad, the gcandson of the Khalifeh, who found that Bahrein was defenceless, went there without any difficulty and sent back to Bushire with his vessels the womenfolk of Sheikh passer. Ahmad died in the year A»Ho 1210 leaving five sons: Suleiman, Abdullah, Khalif eh and two minor sons 0 The first one succeeded his father as the ruler of Bahrein and of Qatar and lived in Qatar, He went very rarely to Bahrein* The Encyclopaedia Britannicastates that the entry of these tribes into Bahrein happened during the next year, i.e# 1199 (1784 A.D*)» It says that these tribes were living and ruling in the Arabian peninsula and were expelled from those regions by the Turks in the year AoEU 1267 {185o A»D») «&gt; The writer of the Khurmoji 'Fars-nameh' states that in the year AJtU 1209 some 4,000 households of the tribes of Bani Athabeh { ) went from Arabia to Bahrein which they subjugated; their leader Ahmad was the Governor of Bahrein and after him his son Abdullah was the Governor, The writer-19- writer of the Hasseri 'Fars-nameh' mentions the date of this incident as A.E. 1210 adding that Sheikh Nasser Khan ¥Jent to Bushire from Bahrein with marksmen from Bashtistan^ 0?he writer of the 'Persian Galf' states that the Waliahis occupied towards the 'beginning of the nineteenth century Lahsa and Bahrein and a part of Oman and menaced Mesopotamia and Syria* They occupied Qatif in the year AoH»1215 (1800 AoBo)• The writer of the 'Maf at ih-ul-Adab' states on page 9 that Saiyid Said, the imam of unseat, went to Bahrein in the year AoH. 1215 and captured the islands after long and hard fighting,, Salman 'ben Ahmad fled to Qatar and Ziara and Saiyid Said entrusted the Government of the islands to his brother&lt;, Salem, and appointed Ifnhammad ben: Khalifeh as his Yazir leaving 200 Nubian gholams of valour with them 0 He left the vessel Karlin anchored in the Vicinity to patrol the islands and returned., Sheikh Nasser went from Bushire to Bahrein where he entered the service of Salem.

In paragraph 5 of that despatch Sir Hugh Biscoe suggested that the light of publicity thrown on Bushire, as one of the largest smuggling in the world, might have some effect, shortly afterwards an Opium Conference was held at Geneva, under the presidency (I think) of Mr.Eender- -son, and an article from the League Correspondent of 'Times** appeared in the issue of that paper for 29tfch January 1931(and doubtless similar articles in other papers) giving the amazing story of the 'Times Maru'. u Whether the publicity was inspired by His Majesty's Government I do not know, but it caused not a little consternation in opium circles in Bushire, and has undoubtedly been the cqvfse of the underground methods which the Persian Government now employs when it wishes unlicensed opium to leave the country.^ jesty's Minister, tish Legation, hran. -in *.[■*!_ JUL!p country.

Subject} Persian Glaim to Behrain, Sir, In continuation of ay despatch Ho.754-8 (jSo.141 to xehran and Ho.755-8 to Secretary of 8tate for India) of the 8th October 1932, which dealt with the protest made by the i 'ersiiua -OTerniaent to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, against the issue of surcharged stamps by the Bahrain GoTernment, I hare the honour to add the following comments of a more general nature. 2. It seems not improbable that this question of the surcharged stamps may again bring the question of the Persian claim to Bahrain to an acute point. The reason for the Persian GoTernment'e protest is obrious enough* the issue of such stamps - unimportant in itself - is one more sign of Bahrain's independence, conducing towards a further weakening of the Persian claim. It is possible that they - the Persian Government - may shortly revive the whole question of their claim, with the usual threat perhaps of a report to the League-2. League of nations. I have been giving the question of the Persian claim to Bahrain some thought since lay arrival here, and the following are seme tentative comraents and suggestions. 3, In going through the correspondenoe on the subject here, of which there is a great deal, I have perused Mr. Dodd's note of 4th March 1932, which formed an enclosure to Mr. Hoare 1 s letter of 9th March to the Foreign Office, In their express letter of 30th May 1932 the Government of India, commenting on Mr# Dodd*s note, saids w The suggestion there made that His Majest^s Government should decline to a©t as intermediary and should simply refer Persian Government to Shaikh is attractive^ but we would inlrite attention to agreement of 1892 by which the Shaikh of Bahrain undertook not to enter into any correspondence with any Power other than the British Government*. The main gist, however, of Mr. Podd's argument was, I think, not the question of the Persian Government referring to the Shaikh direct, but thati (a) As the Shaikh was an independent sovereign the Persian Government could not cite His Maj esty* s Government before the League for arbitration in connection with any question concerning his independence. (b) for a similar reason the Persian Government could not cite the Shaikh himself before the League, quite apart from the fact that he was not a member. In view of these arguments is it not possible that we have acquired something of an 'inferiority complex* with regard to the Persian claim and made rather a bogey of it? As Mr. Hoare points out in his letter quoted above, the Persians, who try .... ■WBL 1 '-fe'-3- try to fri^iten us by threats of publicity, and of reporting us to the League, hare already carried out that threat once and the skies have not fallen. To a large extent, cherefore, their bluff has been called# 4, Could we not therefore at the next suitable opportunity say to the Persian Goveriment something on the following lines? ^ My dear Sirs, in approaching us about your claim to w Bahrain you are barking up the wrong tree. The n Shaikh is the authority concerned. Bahrain is not « a British protectorate. It is an independent State ** in special -treaty relations with His Majesty's * Government. The Shaikh issues his own passports, ' we haire ^ust recently relaxed one of our treaties *• with him so as to giTe Ms State tariff autonomy, w and as you know the Bahrain Grovornmen-c are about to M issue their own stamps, or stamps with their own * surcharge upon them# Tou point out that we look H after B8.hraia foreign relations. This is quite * true, but we do it for the reason that Bahrain is a M small and impecunious State, and cannot afford - 11 like Persia •• to keep expensiTe Ministers and w Consuls abroad. if you like to inform the Shaikh * that you wish him to submit his sovereignty to * arbitration, we will act as a post office for that j w purpose, but you can guess very well what his reply w will be. After you have received the Shaikh's ^ refusal it is for you to decide what you will do. j * You may like to take the matter up to the League, 0 but as you know Bahrain is not a member of the M League, and even if it were the latter cannot force .....5» I do not know isiiat tlie Persian GoTernment will do next but they might adopt harassing tactics with regard to Bahrain dhows, etc.. If we see signs of their taking this line I suggest we could issue them with the following warning, 'With reference to such and such an incident we notice 'that you have started harassing Bahrain dhows (or ^whatever it may be). We must inform you that if ^another incident of this sort occurs we will report 'you at once to the League and our report will not be 'like yours - an unwarranted claim to some body else^ M property - but a definite accusation of a breach of 'international law* We will point out to the League 'that you have lately brought out gunboats to the Gulf, 'which of course you have a perfect ri^it to do, but ''of whose purpose we were always a little suspicious, 'te now understand what they were brought fort to 'harasa Bahrain# As the Shaikh is not a member of w the League the latter may reply to us officially that 'they can do nothing, but unofficially they will 'probably take you to task, and anyhow our report 'will do you no good Miatever in Geneva circles. 'Besides this we will pillory you in the press of the j 'world as a big State bullying a small one. We used 'publicity against you before on one occasion, threaten- s ed you with it on another, and are quite ready to employ it again* If you go further and comoiit acts 'of aggression against the Shaikh we are his ally and 'will assist him to defend himself. Moreover - in islii s o«# * &lt;»'this connection - we must remind you that you 'are signatories to the Kellog Pact,' 6« With regard to the two 'publicity oases 1 * alluded to above. In paragraph 5 of his despatch Ko»5l/l55-S, dated W' 5th April 1930» addressed to His Maj esty* s Minister, Tehran, (Fo.l77-S, dated 14th April 1930, to the Government of India) ©n the subject of opium smuggling from Bushire to the Par Bast, the late Sir Hugh Biscoe suggested that the light of publicity thrown on Bushire, as one of the largest smugglin, centres in the world, mi^it have some effect. The results I ; of this suggestion are dealt with in my despatch Ho, 145 of m A ^ £ 11th October 1932 addressed to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran,(Ho.761-S of 11th October 1932 to Secretary of State for India and Grovernment of India). With regard to the second publicity case. In December 1930 an unfortunate British Indian subject was brutally flogged by the orders of a Persian military officer at Gharbar. His Majesty's Government demanded from the Persian Government punishment of the officer, and compensation for the victim. The Persian Government awarded a nominal punishment on the offender, and refused compensation point blank# At the r suggestion of His Maj esty 1 s Minister, Tehran, His Majesty's Government, the Indian Government concurring, sanctioned that the Persian Government should be threatened with publicity if they did not pay the compensation. After some I argument the Persian Government paid up. ( See correspondence ending with despatch Mo 0 231, dated 17th Ifovember 1931, from . Hoare to Sir Hugh Biscoe (copies to foreign Office and Government of India). I think that these two cases show that the Persian Government do definitely 'respond to treatment'in the matter of publicity 8. It seems to me in faot that while it Is the Persians who threaten us with publicity, the boot is really on the other legs it is in our hands that this instrument lies, by the judicious use of which we can defend ourselves against the Tagaries and fantastic claims of the Persian GoTernment* In the * bad old days * when I first knew this country, then normally in a state of chaos, (days which may perhaps return on the death, or fall from power, of the present Shah), our trump card was a threat of military intervention, which threat every now and then we put into execution^ At the present time, however, the Persian Government, for the time being at all events, having made themselves masters in their own house, and Persia having become a 'civilized' power, and a member of the League, such methods are no longer practicable - even if we were prepared to use them. But 'What we've lost on the roundabouts we've made up on the swings' . If we haire been deprived of one weapon, we have gained another, much cheaper and easier to use* A threat of publicity in the times of the Kajars would have had the same effect on the Persian Goverment as water on a duck's back# How&amp;days, as we know, the Persian Government are extremely sensitive to publicity. I do not suggest for a minute that we should make this threat too frequently, and over every little disagreement that may arise (the weapon would certainly become blunted if over-used), but when important issues are at stake, such as the Persian claim to Bahrain, its employment would seem to be called for.

May I ask you to refer to Government of India -m j^express letter No. P. 19-N/32 of May 30th to the India Office ahout Bahrein arbitration. 2. The Foreign Office are satisfied that whatever the theoretical position the Persian G-overnment could always find ways and means of bringing the question up before the League of Nations or some other international body with His Majesty's Government as the principals. There is therefore little more that need be said on the subject, but all the same I think that the statement in the express letter that Dodd made a 'suggestion that His Majesty's Government should decline to act as intermediary and should simply refer the Persian Government to the Sheikh' is rather misleading. 3. What Dodd said was that if the Persian Government cited His Majesty's Government, that is as principals, they should be told that the dispute lay between them and the Sheikh. He does not say that His Majesty's Government should refuse .Metcalfe Ksquire G.I.E.,M.V.0., reign and Political Department, Simla.-2. refuse to act as intermediaries. In fact, the eleventh and final sentences of the third paragraph of his note indicate just the contrary. 4. It is true that he goes on to suggest that when in due course the citation to arbitration reaches the Sheikh he should he advised to reject it with contumely, hut this does not mean that he suggests that the invitation and the reply should not pass through His Majesty's Government. 5. There is a world of difference between His Majesty's Government acting as principals and His Majesty's Government acting as the agents of the Sheikh. 6.

He haa not got the letter with him - though it might be in his files at Kuwait, or elsewhere, ana had received it as long ago as about last February.

PKri.3I.^ aLk lU ?0 BAHREIK ■ (k-'IS/s/si Reference: letter No. 784-3 of October last to Urn Government of India, a copy of which was sent to the India office, on the subject of the Perslun cliiim to Bahrein. ^ $ 9 2. % letter, as I pointed out in it, was based on a y notu oi Dodd' s ox the 4th March 1932, which fonned an / enclosure to a letter of Hoare* s dated 9tli i .arch of the sarfie year, mere msnoting on i^y files to show that the Better had been pursued further, but the Foreign Office have been good enough to let the India Office show me Oliphant's personal letter to Ho are of 19t .i April, which dealt with DoUd f s views. It appears fro© this letter that the Foreign Office were not much impressed with Dodd's arguments, which were also mine, but I still think that there may be something to be said for them* 3# The point is of considerable Importance. The Foreign Office are in favour of submitting the Persian claim to arbitration, chiefly on the ground tli^t if %e do not agree to arbitration willingly the Persians will xorce us to do so. If we can adopt tactics by which we evade coming to arbitration this argument falls to the ground, suppose, for the sake of argument, that the Persian claim does go to arbitration. The issue cited before the arbitrators, whoever they may be, will presumably be in the nature of a query as towhether Bahrein belongs to Persia or to the Sheikh of Bahrein? Ihere will, of course, be no issue cited as to whether it belongs to us or not. prima facie , therefore, we do not Appear in the picture.1° 2. 4. Ollphant, in his letter, says that DocUTs main argument, th-at the Persians are unaDle to take before the League, is 'definitely unsound, being based on the erroneous assumption that the Persians are bound to admit that Bahrein is a foreign sovereign state,' I do not think that Dodd's argument really depenas on this assumption* Hiat Dodd says is that the Persian claim lies not against us but against the Sheikh, who, lor various reasons, cannot be cited before the League* I have no douut, a® uiiphant goes on to say in the same paragraph of i hxs letter, tnat uie Persian ofxenslve befox*e the League would be directed against H»K.O*, but my view still is that if the latter declare that they are not a party to the suit they cannot be cited. Of course, if like to intervene, then by their own action they become 'implicated'. _ o. Oliphant suggests that the Persian Government could support their offensive against on the ground that the latter were supporting the case of a Persian rebel and had failed to respect Persian sovereignty over a Persian isi-anci. But in the initial moves of the game, if ^ we play it on the non-citable basis, there is no question of support, on the next occasion when the Persians approach us with their Bahrein claim we coula reply: 'It is true that the Sheikh is in special treaty relations with j. us, ouy all the same he is an independent ruler and your claim should be addressed to him. if you like we will act as a post office for the purpose.' ISiere would then be four courses open to the Persian Government:- (a)/(a) to address a letter to the Sheikh, through us, stating their claim to his territory; (o) to attempt to cite us Oefore the League, quoting our reply to their latest approach; (c) to drop the question tacitly Oy mking no further move; (a) to attempt to uphold their claim oy force. Course (a) is unlikely, as of course the Persian Goveiment are well aware what reply tney would get from the sheikh. f 6. Course (b) is the crux round which the arguments centre. Oliphant, in para^rafti 5 of his letter, admits that m have no arhitration treaty with Persia; that the latter and m have accepted the Optional Clause wiili reservations which woulo exclude a dispute regarding tue Persmn claim to sovereignty over Bahrein; and that therefore neither party hy unilateral action can cite tae o Jier before the Hague Court or the League. Our refusal to arbitrate, therefore, woula seem to stand on firm legal grounds. Qliphant, however, proceeds to envisage various tactics oy which the Persian Government might manoeuvre whemselvcss inu) a position to present the Council of the League with a case, which he details. I presume the League would ask us for a reply to the case. It might be as follows. The Sheikh was an independent ruler, not under our protection (as stated in toe Persian case), but in special treaty relations with us. As proof of his Independence we could adduce the facts that He had complete powers over his own subjects (foreign subjects beiijg dealt with under capitulations similar to those t&amp;u.t existed previously in the independent countries of Persia/4, IX Persia and. Turkey); issued his own passports; had his own stamps and enjoyed the right of tariff autonoi^y (we have just given him this). Further, that in the beginning of 1933, on the death of the old Sheikh, H.L.G. had acknowledged him independent ruler of Bahrein. (Personally I do not see how having done this we could possibly agree to arbtration). That, therefore, we were not parties to the suit and that the Sheikh was in a similar position, since he was not a member of the League, and even if he were the question of his sovereignty was not a question on which he could be cited; that there was no question of our •professing' to be under an obligation to defend his independence; we were bound to do so by a treaty made long before the League came into existence. I do not see how, on a reply based on these lines, the Persian Government could make use of Article 11 of the Covenant, as suggested by Oliphant. In fact, if Persia became bellicose we could use our 'friendly right' under section a of that Article to bring the matter to trie attention of the League, with tho attendant publicity (as indicated in paragraph 5 of my letter quoted above), laying stress on the fact that Persia had signed the Kellogg Pact. Article 15 of the Covenant, which Cliphant also suggests the Persian Government might Use, surely only refers to members of the League?Telegram E.30 From Political Igent, Bahrain.

I was able to find out yesterday afternoon that the Governor of Bushire had emharked on the 'Barpeta' at Lingeh. The possibility of the Governor of Bushire being on board had been mentioned to the Shaikh that morning and he agreed that it was most unwise to allow him to land, should he by any chance wish to do so. 2» In the evening Belgrave and I discussed the matter and it was decided that the best way out of the difficulty was to arrange that the Chief of the Bahrain State Police should go on board this evening (6 P. m ) and be ready to inform the Governor politely that it was regretted that it was not possible for him to land. This message would only be conveyed to him should he show any inclination to do so. At the same time to prevent any popular demonstration by the Persians,Belgrave and Russell thought it a good opportunity to restrict the ever incree.sing swarm of visitors to ships in harbour. For some time past,Captains of the slow mail steamers have complained bitterly that crowds,which swarm on to their ships will one day break down the gangway,so Belgrave has prepared a notice for the Shaikh's signature to tiie effect that from today no casual visitor can leave the shore without a permit to do so. 3. These are the arrangements that we have made and we hope that there will be no incident. )l2 Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch,I,A., Litical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.HI &lt;0* V HO. ^^5 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 31st August 1933 A#«.

W11H reference to Foreign Office letter of the 24th August, enclosing a copy of a telegram from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran regarding the possibility that the Persian Government may raise the question of the Persian claims to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa during the forthcoming sessions of the Council or Assembly of the League of Nations, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you for the information of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare the accompanying copies of telegraphic correspondence^) with Sir Reginald Hoare. 2. It appears from Sir Reginald Hoare's telegram of the 25th August that there is now somewhat less ground for expecting that the matter will be raised at Geneva next month. Sir John Simon had, however, before its receipt caused an examination to be made of the various ways in which the Persian claims could be raised before the Council or Assembly of the League and the courses which it would be open to His Majesty's Government to pursue in each case. He still considers it desirable to bring the results of this examination to the notice of Sir Samuel Hoare and to learn his views thereon. 3. Sir John Simon is advised that there are three recognised methods by which the Persian representative could bring the claims in question before the Council or Assembly at their forthcoming sessions. He might, in his speech during the general discussion, which takes place at the beginning of each Assembly, assert the pretensions of his Government in general terms. (If the matter were raised in this manner, no question would arise of any action being taken by any organ of the League.) Alternatively, he might bring the question before the Council under article 11 of the League Covenant. Or, again, he might bring it before them under article 15: (The texts of these articles are annexed hereto for convenience of reference.) In the case of such an appeal under the provisions of the Covenant, the following points of procedure are relevant: Normally three weeks' notice is required for the insertion of an item in the pro visional agenda of the Council, and the provisional agenda for the next session of the Council, which opens on the 7th September, have already been circulated. In cases of urgency, however, the Council has, in practice, the power to add further items to its agenda at short notice. There will also be a session of the new Council, which will be constituted at the session of the Assembly, on or about the 20th September, and in the case of this later session the normal three weeks' notice is not required. 4. The first of the three contingencies enumerated above is evidently the least serious, and, in Sir John Simon's view, it would only be necessary for the United Kingdom delegation to make a brief counter-statement, combining a reference to the views of His Majesty's Government on the subject of the Persian claim to Bahrein, as already set forth in documents circulated to the members of the League, with a short outline of the case for regarding the Persian claims to Tamb and Abu Musa to be at least equally unsound on generally similar grounds. It appears to Sir John Simon that it would undoubtedly be desirable, in order to avoid the deleterious effects of a period of uncertainty as to the reply of His Majesty's Government that the United Kingdom delegation should be in a position to reply immediately on these lines, since if any answer was to be made, this could only be done during the course of the general discussion with which the Assembly opens. With this end in view he would propose to provide the delegation with the necessary material for such a statement in advance and suggests that his department should collaborate with the India Office on its preparation forthwith. ( 1 )Not printed. [190 gg—1]5. With regard to the second and third contingencies envisaged above, namely, a definite appeal by Persia for the assistance of the League under either article 11 or article 15 of the Covenant, it has been suggested in the course of past interdepartmental discussions that further proceedings at Geneva might be arrested at the outset by the preliminary objection that, in view of the evident absurdity of the Persian claims, the matter is not one which could properly be raised under these or any other articles of the Covenant, and the Council should therefore, not proceed to consider the merits of the question. This course. Sir John Simon is advised, is not practicable for the following reasons : The general lines of the Persian thesis would doubtless be that Persia claimed sovereignty over the islands in question; that she wished to establish administrative control there; and that she was prevented from doing so by the attitude of His Majesty's Government. A claim such as this by one Power for the restitution to it of territory which it is prevented from administering by the action of another is eminently one of those which may be properly submitted to the Council under articles 11 or 15. It would be manifestly impossible to contend that claims of this class did not come within the scope of these articles of the Covenant. It is true that His Majesty's Government maintain that in this particular case the Persian claim is without legal foundation; but, as the Council clearly cannot accept the ex 'parte assertion to this effect of one of the parties to the dispute, the Council would necessarily have to go into the merits of the Persian claim in order to reject it on this ground. This argument, therefore, cannot be advanced as a preliminary objection to the Council dealing with the matter at all, since it is only an answer to the Persian claim on the merits. Sir John Simon does not think, therefore, that there is any argument which His Majesty's Government could successfully advance before the Council as a valid objection to the Council's dealing with the merits of the case under articles 11 and 15. 6. The Council would, then, be obliged, regardless of the attitude adopted by His Majesty's Government, to deal with the dispute if the matter were referred to it under articles 11 or 15 of the Covenant, and a refusal on the part of His Majesty's Government to co-operate, by furnishing the Council with all the evidence available in support of their case, could only react unfavourably on their own interests. 7. In the case of disputes brought under article 15, the procedure is for the Council to call on both parties, in the first instance, for statements of their respective cases. It then endeavours to settle the dispute by conciliation; and if this proves impossible, it issues a report giving its own opinion as to the position and stating what should be done. In the present case conciliation would clearly be impossible, and the Council would, at an early stage, find itself faced with a simple question of lawis the Persian claim to sovereignty over these islands sound or is it not? The Council is, in general, loath to give a ruling on purely legal questions, and having explored without success the possibilities of con ciliation, it would in all probability seek the consent of the two parties to the reference of the dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice of The Hague, railing such consent, the Council would appoint its own committee of jurists to advise it and, on the strength of their advice, would issue a report containing recommendations as to the settlement of the dispute. 8. It will be observed from the foregoing exposition that no action or inaction on the part of His Majesty's Government could prevent the Persian c aim being considered by the Permanent Court of International Justice or by the Council of the League. A reference of the question to The Hague Court could, on the other hand be prevented by either party to the dispute, and it is therefore relevant to consider which of these alternatives would be preferable from the pont of view of His Majesty's Government. Sir John Simon is strongly ® opinion a a reference to The Hague Court would be the more advan tageous course from the pont of view of His Majesty's Government. The dispute I is a clean-cut legal issue and the Law Officers of the Crown have recently advised r p g m n 0Ver Bahrein - Exce P t ' ^erefore, in the most pt I f Fersm ^ Government being able to establish further relevant to tbpm sli- Tn^ q P ;f ( befo 1 re . the Law Officers when the case was referred T n , n0 d ?V b 1 t whatever th at, if the case came before the of the npi nf p 6 ^ be given against Persia. A consideration of the personnel of the Permanent Court and a careful study of the iudraients given by the court up to date afford no ground whatever for the view that there\ if any - poSsibility 0 l 1 tlle 1 Permanent Court deciding wrongly a legal question where % there is no reasonable doubt as to what is the right conclusion from a legal'point Ul of view, it is perfectly true that many of the past judgments of the court have been given by narrow majorities, and it is equally true that in one or two of these opj, cases there are lawyers who are of the opinion that the maiority of the court M f C T e J ? X wr011 o conclusion; but these were cases where the'legal question )iit| submitted to the court was admittedly a doubtful one on which lawyers might be leg expected to diner. It may be that, in circumstances where the legal arguments 9 11 e1 ^ 81 e pear to be equally cogent, an individual judge's conclusions may fe(( be influenced by his own personal prejudices or sympathies; but there seems no Hai ground whatever for supposing it to be possible that the Permanent Court would lt[ | decide a clear legal issue wrongly through personal and national prejudice, lol Further, even 11 it were to be supposed that the Permanent Court was strongly . influenced by extra-legal considerations (a hypothesis which is not thought to be dtii 18 conceive of any reasons why, in a dispute between His j 4 Majesty s Government and the Persian Government as regards sovereignty over . ■ islands m the Persian Gulf, the prejudices of the majority of the court should be 'Iv ^ favour of Persia rather than of His Majesty's Government. Indeed, it would , n , appear to be natural that the contrary should be the case, seeing that the support f and confidence of His Majesty's Government is absolutely essential to the court if it is to maintain its present high position. The views of Persia are relatively * unimportant from this point of view. 9. If, on the other hand, the Council were obliged to give an opinion based 1 on the findings of a legal committee set up under its auspices, while there is little, WE if any, reason to doubt that in so clear a case the legal point would be decided in accordance with its merits, it is possible that in an attempt to spare Persian susceptibilities the Council might frame their report in such terms as would not ball dispose of the Persian claim in so final and definite a manner. Sir John Simon ittr does not wish to suggest that this would necessarily, or even probably, be the mt result; for the Council has been known on occasion to give an entirely clear-cut ih decision, as, for example, in the dispute between Colombia and Peru on the point ii relating to the sovereignty over the Letitia trapezium. He considers, however, that, in the circumstances envisaged, there would be definite advantage in the iisl reference of the Persian claims to the Permanent Court of International Justice. 10. This conclusion, of course, depends upon the hypothesis, which would oil appear to be a reasonably safe one, that the Persian Government cannot establish jep a series of facts relevant to their claim over Bahrein which are at present unknown did to His Majesty's Government and which might warrant a less confident view of the strength of their legal case. If Sir Samuel Hoare conceives this to be a danger, it 0 could be avoided if His Majesty's Government allowed the Persian Government Djjj fully to develop their case before the Council before they announced their readiness . for the matter to be decided by the Permanent Court. If, when Persia developed . her case, the facts upon which she relied appeared to be substantially different from those at present known to His Majesty's Government, the decision as to the Vjl line to be taken by His Majesty's Government could be reconsidered; but, in the j event of the Persian expose not adducing any such new facts, then Sir John Simon 16 considers that it would be the wisest policy for His Majesty's Government at the , commencement of their reply to indicate His Majesty's Government's willingness . t to have recourse to the Permanent Court. 11. The foregoing paragraphs deal with the situation which would arise if ^ ; the Persian appeal were made under article 15 of the Covenant. If the matter were raised under article 11, it is probable that the procedure followed would, in li f the first stages, be the same, the Council endeavouring to obtain the agreement of f the parties to a reference of the dispute to The Hague Court, and, if that proved i i! impossible, seeking the advice of a special committee of jurists. The essential # difference between the two contingencies lies in the fact that under article 11 the Council has powers of conciliation only. Its report would not, therefore, have the itlf' same force as one issued under article 15. It is, however, to be anticipated that B p the endeavours of the Council to bring about a settlement would result in dragging )ei : out the proceedings over a long period and, if only for this reason, it can hardly rjs 1 ' be doubted that a reference to The Hague Court would be preferable from the point of view of His Majesty's Government, iiil 12. Sir John Simon is impressed with the desirability of securing, so far as ,jiil possible, that if the Persian Government do in fact raise the question of the4 Persian claims to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa before the Council or Assembly of the League, the matter should be disposed of with as little delay as possible. Clearly, once the matter has been raised, the longer the result is m doubt the more harmful will be the impression among the Arabs of the Persian Gull, it appears to him, therefore, that it would be prudent, not only to arrange, as suggested in paragraph 4 above, that the United Kingdom delegation should be prepared with an immediate reply for use if the Persian delegation raise the matter before the Assembly, but also to take a decision in principle as to the general line which His Maiesty's Government should adopt, if the Persian claims were to be raised by way of an appeal to the Council under articles 11 or 15 of the Covenant. Sir John Simon will therefore be glad to know whether Sir Samuel Hoare agrees m the views expressed upon this latter point in paragraphs 8—11 of this letter. I am, &amp;c. C. F. A.

[The Memorandum which follows deals with the history 01 Bahrein from the point of view primarily of the political status of the islands at various periods and in particular with the claims to sovereignty over them put forward by .Persia at various dates since 1783, and with the corre spondence and discussions which have taken place in connection with such claims. The principal authorities quoted, apart from original despatches and letters, are the following ;— (1) Lorimer; ' Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.' Selections from Records of the Grovernment of Bombay,' Vol. XXIV (1856). (3) Aitchison : ' Treaties ' (1933 Edition), Vols. XI (Persian Gulf) and XIII (Persia).

(8) P.G. 13: ' Historical Summary of Events affecting the British Position in the Persian Gulf, 1907-28.' I.—Geographical Situation. 1. The Principality of Bahrein consists of the archipelago formed by the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na'asan, Sitra, and Nabi Salih, and by a number of lesser islets and rocks. Taken altogether these form a compact group almost in the middle of the V-shaped gulf on the Arabian littoral Lor- II ' 234 - of the Persian Gulf which divides the independent Arab Trucial Sheikhdom of Qatar from the coast of Qatif in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 2. The term ' Bahrein ' formerly embraced the promon tory of Qatar and the oases of Qatif and Hasa on the Arabian mainland, as well as the islands of the archipelago, and, according to Lorimer, ' some authorities would attribute to it in the past an even more extended application, affirming Lor ' II ' 233- that it once denoted the whole western side of the Persian Gulf from Ruus-al-Jibal to the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab.' 11.—Bahrein prior to 1783. 3. The very conflicting evidence available goes to show Bombay that Bahrein was subject to Persian rule for a period in the Selections, early part of the Christian era, and between A.D. 615 and XXIV, 23. 723. It is stated to have been conquered by one Keshan bin ^ jg Abdul Malik, and to have come under the sway of the 0/22.2! 1870. Oommiyyad Caliphs, in the latter year, and to have remained para. 2. under the control of the Caliphs until the close of the Wj j s0]1 Abbaside dynasty in the 11th century, when it again became PersianGulf, subject to chiefs of its own race. . Its mediasval history is pp. 85-6. obscure, but a writer who visited the islands in A.D. 1051 refers to the fact that half of the pearls taken in Bahrein belong to the Chiefs of Hasa on the Arab mainland. Idrisi, Wilson, the Arab geographer, writing about a century later, states 88-90. 2953 200 7.34 A^ . that the island 'is governed by an independent chief. Ihe inhabitants of the two shores are satisfied with his justice and piety, and when he dies he is replaced by a person of Wilson, 105. equal virtue and piety.' It was conquered a 011 | ,' | iZ. the (Arab) rulers of Hormuz, a kingdom finally subdued by Wilson, 116. the Portuguese in 1506 but Bahrlin tributary to Persia m at any rate its later days mm em appears at the same date to have fallen under I ortuguese control. The Persians have adopted m a recent on the subject a statement that it remained under Portuguese control from 1507 to 1622. It would appear, however, that there are at any rate some breaks in the continuitj 7 of Poituguese control. An agreement of 1515 between the Portuguese and the Persians, under which the King of Hormuz was to be of Hormuz in the name of King Dom Manuel, his Lord, Wilson 121 provided inter alia that Portuguese shipping should be ' ' available to enable the Persians to invade Bahrein and Qatif. Wilson 124 In 1522 a revolt stimulated by the King of Hormuz broke ' out against the Portuguese at Bahrein among other places, but was quelled, and in 1528 endeavours by the Portuguese to quell a subsequent rebellion in Bahrein against the King Lor I 841. beaten off. In 1559 it was temporarily occupied by the Turks, who were, however, driven out by the Portuguese in the same year. In 1602 the Portuguese were forcibly Wilson 140. expelled from the islands by the Persians. The Persian occupation was of uncertain duration, and in their Note of 2nd August 1928 they refer to 1622 as the date on which Lor. 1, 836. Persia regained possession of Bahrein. They appear in any event to have had a military depot in Bahrein in 1622. Cmzon, Curzon states that ' the Portuguese ... in 1625 concluded Persia, II, a treaty with Shah Abbas, by which they restored to him 419 - all his coast possessions, retaining only the pearl banks at Bahrein. . . 4. In or about 1718 the islands were occupied by the Arabs of Muscat, who, however, appear to have maintained their occupation for a short time only. It is not clear whether at the date of this attack the islands were derelict or whether they were held by a Persian garrison. About 1753 the Ruler under the Persian Government of the town of Bushire made a descent upon Bahrein, the chief resident tribe in which (the Huwalah Arabs—at the present day still strongly represented in the islands) was seriously divided by internal feuds, and established his authority there. In this manner the islands again became, at least in vor. I, 8. . uamej dependent on Persia. In 1782 the Arabs of Zubarah, on the Arabian mainland, efforts to reduce which had been made by the Governor of Bahrein under the Persians in the years immediately preceding that date, retaliated by a Lor i 839- ^ escerit 011 the island of Bahrein. They defeated the 40, ' 'Persian Governor, drove him to his fort, plundered and destroyed the town of Manama, and took possession of a Bushire vessel, with which they retired to Zubarah. A counter attack was repulsed, and in the following year the Uttabi Arabs of Zubarah, assisted by contingents from various tribes of Qatar, occupied the Bahrein islands, the Persian garrison of the Manama Fort capitulating on'28th .1 uly 1783, aftei a siege of about two months duration, and being allowed to return to Bushire. Summary. 5. It will be seen that while the history of Bahrein prior to 1783 is very obscure, it would appear that Persia for not inconsiderable periods exercised control over the islands. Phe nature of that control is not, however, very clear; it seems probable that it was only very rarely of a definite character; and even in more recent periodsniter of vZ?

In 1811 the islands were freed from Wahabi rule by the Imam of Muscat, when the Uttabis were restored to power, though according to a claim subsequently made by by the Imam, in subordination to Muscat. In 1816 the Uttabis sought the protection of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia, and the Imam of Muscat undertook an armed expedition against Bahrein, explaining to the British authori ties that he was compelled so to act by the repudiation by the Attabis of his suzerainty, which they had admitted in 1811, by their alliance with the Wahabis and by their piratical practices. The Muscat expedition, to which three Bushire vessels were added by the Persian Government, effected a landing in the summer of 1816, but was signally repulsed and withdrew. Unsuccessful negotiations took place later in the same year between Muscat and the Persian Bo. Sel., Government with a view to a fresh attempt on Bahrein. XXIV, 372. Subsequently, but apparently in the same year, a Persian emissary, one Sikander Khan, arrived in Bahrein, who * This was, of course, incorrect.

In 1818, on the appearance of the Egyptians in Hasa^ the Sheikh of Bahrein appears to have offered to assist them Lor. 1,846. with sea transport. In February 1819 the Sheikh enteied into an agreement with the British Government, with the terms of winch he subsequently failed to comply, foi preventing the sale of captured British property in his- dominions, and in the same year he expressed great indignation at the violation by the British authorities, undei a misapprehension as to the nationality of certain vessels, of the neutrality of his port. Teh. Desp. 12. On the 19th April 1819 His Majesty's Representative No. 16 of a t Tehran reported to the Government of India that the 25.5.1819. Tm ain of Muscat had complained bitterly against the non- fulfilment of the engagements contracted with him by the Persian Government for the capture of Bahrein, The Minister added that letters received by him showed that the troops of Ibrahim Pasha, the Viceroy of Egypt, had occupied Bahrein (this appears to have been incorrect) and that the- Imam had suggested to the Shah that he should send a messenger to the Pasha asking him to evacuate the island. The Imam is stated to have urged upon the Shah the necessity of endeavouring to recover a possession which according to him ' had for ages acknowedged the sovereignty of Persia.' He was, however, unsuccessful, and in June 1819' His Majesty's Minister reported that the Shah had ' for the present ' dropped all intention of taking any steps in pursuit of his pretensions to the sovereignty of the island. It may be added here that the Government of Bombay in a despatch of 21st July 1819 to the Government of India, in which they discussed the desirability of assisting the Imam of Muscat,, in return for assistance in connection with the expedition proposed against the Gulf pirates, to establish his claims to Bahrein, referred to an ' arrangement some time since concerted between the Shah and the Imam, whereby the former 'had agreed to relinquish all claims to the island of Bahrein in favour of the Imam, under the condition of receiving a portion of its revenues.' 13. The Persians, at the _ beginning of 1820, moved apparently by a desire to anticipate any attempt by Muscat to establish control over Bahrein with the support of His Majesty s Government, unsuccessfully requested the Imam to convey their troops to Bahrein. They addressed a similar B ahrein submits to M uscat , 1820.5 application, equally unsuccessful, to the Commander of the Lor T 847 British Expedition m the Persian Gulf. In the early part of ' ^ 1820 the rulers of Bahrein made full submission to the Imam of Muscat and agreed to pay him a tribute of 30,000 dollars An instalment (12,000 dollars) of this tribute appears subsequently to have been actually remitted.

Ihe policy to be adopted by the British Government in regaid to Bahrein was examined between the Government of Bombay and the Government of India in 1819-20, and was ultimately defined as one of complete neutrality. The Govt, of transfei of Bahiein to the Imam of Muscat had been contem- Bombay to plated, but this project, so far as the British Government ' ■' were concerned, was now abandoned. The Government of 15121 ^ 1 ^ Bombay suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that paraS ' so long as he restrained his subjects from piracy he would reap the advantage of a friendly neutrality on the part of Britain, whereas should a piratical spirit manifest itself forcible measures of coercion would be applied to him. They added that the conclusion of an engagement in general terms with the Sheikh ' would probably tend to convince the Uttabi Arabs of the integrity of our intentions.'

Simultaneously the Government of Bombay, in a despatch to the Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, remarked that Dated ' we mean to avoid all interference in respect of the island 15.12.1819, of Bahrein. ... There is, however, reason to believe that P ai,a - 11 - provided the Persian Government will consent to the Uttabis continuing in the undisturbed occupation of Bahrein the Sheikh would readily agree to pay them tribute, and for this purpose the mediation of the British Government would be gladly afforded provided it could be employed in such a manner as to avoid anything which might in any shape involve us in . the transactions of the parties after the conclusion of the negotiation immediately referred to. . . . ' T reaty of 1820 between B ahrein and H is M ajesty's G overnment. 16. On the 17th January 1820 the Sheikh agreed to surrender certain pirate craft which had taken refuge in his territories, and undertook to the British Government not to admit any more boats of the same character until authorised to do so by the British authorities. On the 5th February 1820 a preliminary Treaty of Peace was signed between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government, and on the 23rd February 1820 the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the General Treaty of Peace which had Aitchison been made between His Majesty's Government and the Arab Vol. XI, rulers of the Persian Gulf and under which His Majesty's - No - T ' i ' 233 - Government undertook, in return for abstention by those Aitchison, rulers from piracy and the slave trade, that ' if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it' 245-9 1X ' (Article 10). The Sheikh of Bahrein went so far as to Lt McLeod claim subsequently that the treaty in question established to Govt, of relations of protection and dependence between the British Bombay, Government and himself, but it was made clear to him by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf while on a visit p aras . 30' to Bahrein in 1823 that this was not the case. 64-5. Proposal for British Mediation hy Pers 17. On 10th May 1820 His Majesty's Minister at Tehran reported to the Government of Bombay that he had been received in audience by the Shah on 5th May and had put 2953 • B Precis, 297.Teh.

Sir H. Willock remarked that the great repugnance of the Shah to the formation of any t settlement in the neighbourhood of Persia was strongly manifested by His Majesty's not immediately accepting the British mediation to obtain a tribute from the island of Bahrein, an object which he so urgently desired and which His Majesty was aware must at a future period be dimcu t of attainment from the already advanced stage of negotia tions between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Imam of Muscat.' and withdrawn (1820)« 18. On the 3rd October 1820 the Government of Bombay instructed Sir H. Willock to take the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government ' that as our viewb are exclusively limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation we formerly offered between His Majesty [the Shah] and the Uttabis of Bahrein.' Summary, 1783-1820. 19. In 1799 the Sheikhdom, independent since 1783, professed allegiance to Persia and paid a year's tribute, but it was immediately afterwards conquered by the Imam of Muscat, and thereafter fell under the influence and ultimately the control of the Wahabi Amir. Liberated by Muscat in 1811, it appealed to the Wahabis in 1816 against the Imam and defeated him. In 1816 or 1817 a Persian envoy was received at Bahrein and presents exchanged. While no details are available as to what precisely took place on this occasion, the incident had no effective sequel. Persian authority was not asserted in the island between the date of the visit and 1820, and in the latter year the island became temporarily subject and tributary to Muscat. In 1820 Bahrein entered into its first formal treaty with the British Government, and that Government, on condition that the Sheikhs abstained from piracy, undertook to ' take notice ' ' if any shall attack them.'

In 1822 Captain Bruce, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, acting on his own initiative and without any authority from or prior reference to Government, having proceeded of^ his own accord to Shiraz there signed an agreement with the Minister of the Prince Governor of bhiraz, on the part of Persia. This agreement alleged, aha, m regard to Bahrein, that the islands had always been subordinate to the Governor of Fars, against whose authority the Uttabi Sheikhs had lately become rebellious; that the nag assigned to the Uttabis of Bahrein under the General Ireaty of Peace with Britain in 1820 should accordingly, if a ready granted, be withdrawn, that no assistance should in future be rendered by Britain to the Uttabis of Bahrein, and that on the contrary the British Government should, if requested, assist the Persians against Bahrein with ' one or two vessels of war. In other words, the title of Persia to the possession of Bahrein was explicitly admitted.

Bahrein—Muscat Disputes. 22. By 1822, if not earlier, the Sheikhs of Bahrein had Lor. I, 851. ceased to observe the engagement undertaken by them in Govr. to 1820 to pay an annual tribute to Muscat. In August 1822, Imam, an attack by Muscat on Bahrein seeming in consequence imminent, the Governor of Bombay, in letters to the Sheikh ghdkh 0 and to the^ Imam of Muscat, suggested that if this tribute 19.8.1822. was of ancient origin it should be regularly paid, but that Precis, 307. otherwise it should be dropped. In January 1823 the Lor. 1,850. Political Resident (Lieut. McLeod) visited Bahrein to Resdt. to reassure the Sheikhs in regard to the unratified treaty Grovt. of concluded by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of ^ Om o ay ' Shiraz, and to inform them that that treaty was of no effect 27 0 2.1823. and that no change of policy was contemplated by Govern- Lor.

In the spring of 1823, on rumours of a contemplated Govt, of joint attack on Bahrein by Persia, Muscat and the Arabs of Bombay to the mainland, the Minister at Tehran was asked at a suitable Tell -&gt; juncture to dissuade the Persians from disturbing the tranquillity of the Gulf. 26.3.1823. 23.

In 1825 the Governor of Bombay personally remonstrated with the Imam of Muscat on an endeavour by the latter to interfere in the question of the Bahrein succession consequent on the death in that year of Sheikh Salman, who had ruled the Sheikhdom since 1796 (in Lor.

In 1825 an intimation was made by the Political Resident to the Prince Governor of Fars, who had been meditating an expedition to subdue Bahrein, and whose Minister had requested the Resident to give directions to the Sheikh to strike the flag which the British Government had authorised the Uttabis of Bahrein to fly, 'He was informed that no control was assumed over the people ofBombay Bahrein and that the ^y^'of^onduot^Government SSL '-f, Balrein 1 ' The expedition was 2.7.1825.

Summary, 1820-30. 26. During the first two years of this period the islands acknowledged the supremacy of and, for a time, paid tribute to Muscat. ' From 1822 to 1829 they were intermittently at feud with Muscat. In 1829 a treaty was concluded by which Muscat withdrew its claims to supremacy and to tribute. The Persian claim was alluded to m 1822 and iodb but not pressed. V.—1830-40. Bahrein and 1830-35. 27. In the course of 1830-31 the Sheikhs, His Majesty &amp; Government having refused to intervene in their favour, and fearing a combination between the Amir and i\luscat, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir of the Arab mainland. They agreed to acknowledge the Amir's supremacy and to pay a tribute to him. He on his part undertook to protect Lor. 1,856-7. Bahrein against external aggression. In 1833, however, the Sheikh felt strong enough to repudiate Wahabi supremacy, and he conducted a not unsuccessful offensive against the Wahabis between 1833 and 1835. Bahrein and 28. Sheikh Khalifah-hin-Salman, who had been joint Lor. I, iii, ruler with his uncle Sheikh Abdulla since the death of Table 9. gheikh Salman in 1825, died in 1834, and was succeeded as joint ruler by his son Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah. Effective control continued to rest with Sheikh Abdullah. Internal dissension in the ruling family became more marked between 1834 and 1839, and the misgovernment of the island continued to grow with unfortunate effects on its prosperity. His Majesty's Government, although in 1834 they had to take forcible measures against the Sheikh to secure reparation for an insult to their Residency Agent in Bahrein, were, however, content to abstain from any interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein so long as the Sheikhs discharged the obligations undertaken by their Treaty of 1820. Restrictive Line applied to Bahrein, 1836. 29. In 1835 the British Government renewed the maritime truce which they had imposed in 1820 on the Arab rulers of the Gulf in the interest of the suppression of piracy. The Sheikh of Bahrein was not, however, included in the renewed truce, partly apparently because he had Lor. I, 860 behaved so well that this was thought unnecessary, partly because he could be easily punished in the event of this proving desirable, and partly lest in the event of his inclusion he might claim British intervention if attacked by Muscat. In March 1836 the Sheikh agreed, however, to theapplication to Bahrein of the 'Restrictive Line,' this being tlZll i 0 T in i fu y if by His Ma i est y' s Government between which and the Persian coast no naval hostilities were in luture to be permitted. Reassertion of Persian claim. to the Wahahis, 1836. 30. In the middle of 1836 the Sheikh, alarmed by a Bombay communication from the Governor of Shiraz calling on him Selections, aS -u ers ! ian object to tender his submission to the Shah -^XIV, 385. and by the possibility of the co-operation of the Imam of - Lor - I ' 858 - Muscat in a Persian attack on Bahrein, took steps for a reconciliation with the Wahabi Amir. As a result he agreed to pay a nominal tribute of 12,000 to the Amir, the Amir on his side_ agreeing to supply troops for the QGiGiice of Bah rein against external attacks and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh for marine transport in the event of a W ahabi attack on Muscat by sea. 1837 the Sheikh, with the prior approval of Her Lor I 860 Majesty's Government, was allowed to punish certain pirates. In 1839 the Resident was invoked to settle internal disputes in the ruling family, but the parties would not agree to any settlement without a guarantee by Her Majesty's Government, which Her Majesty's Government were not prepared to give. Egyptian Invasion of Hasa : Sheikh professes to be a Persian Subject, 1839. 32. In 1838-39 the Egyptians conquered Hasa and cap- Bombay tured the Wahabi Amir. They thereupon demanded the Selections, payment of tribute and certain territorial concessions from the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Egyptian Commander about 387 ~ 8 ' the same time intimated to the British authorities his inten tion to attack and reduce the island. The Sheikh appealed for assistance to the Government of India, but in the absence of instructions from Her Majesty's Government the Govern ment of India were at first not prepared to give him any pledge and the Sheikh was instructed to decide for himself as to waiting on the Egyptian representative. Much alarmed by the proceedings of the Egyptians, 'and perhaps even more so by a rumour, apparently well founded, that the Saiyed of Oman was intriguing with the Egyptians to obtain and hold Bahrein as a fief under the Viceroy of Egypt,' the Sheikh thereon professed, in reply to demands made on him in the name of the Egyptians, to be a subject of the Persian Government. Apparently as the result of overtures by the Sheikh designed to substantiate this, the Prince Governor of Shiraz thereupon sent an envoy—one Lor. I, 862. Haji Qasim, formerly supercargo of a trading vessel—to reside in Bahrein as Persian agent, ' and to be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief was disposed to pay for their countenance and protection,' and to bear a Robe of Honour and a letter to the Sheikh. The envoy was accompanied by a guard of 10 Persian infantry. No details appear to be available xxiv 388. about his mission, which was apparently a failure. 33. On 1st April 1839 Admiral Sir F. Maitland, then Precis, 375, commanding the Gulf Squadron, was instructed by the G-ovt. of Government of Bombay to give the Sheikh all support against the Egyptians, short of actually entering on dated 4.1839 hostilities. If the Sheikh asked for a new engagement with Her Majesty's Government he should offer to transmit his proposals to India. The Resident was simultaneously to send a formal protest to the Egyptians.

In the same month the Sheikh promised the Assistant Political Resident to take no steps to place himself under the authority or protection of a foreign Power without first consulting the Political Resident. Sheikh submits to Egyptians (July 1839). 34. In J uly 1839 the Sheikh ' suddenly and un expectedly' acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and agreed to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dollars a year, on the understanding that his local authority would be observed and that no representative of the Egyptians would be sent to reside in Bahrein. The Resident protested m writing to both the Sheikh and the Egyptians, and expostulated with the Sheikh on the way m which he was sacrificing his independence. The Sheikh explained that his action was the result of the refusal of Her Majesty's Government to give him advice or a specific assurance of support. For a trifling financial payment he had now secured immunity from Interference. He offered, however, in return for a written and distinct pledge of protection, to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependent of Her Majesty's Government; but on being_ pressed he refused to confirm this in writing and said that in any event it would be necessary for him to justify his change of attitude to the Egyptians on the ground that it was the result of compulsion by Her Majesty's Government. Precis, 393. Hertslet, 1874, p. 5. 1839-40. Views of Her Majesty's Government on future Policy towards Bahrein. 35. As a consequence of the activities of the Egyptians discussion appears about this time to have taken place as to the desirability of declaring a regular protectorate over Bahrein. On 1st July 1839 the Secret Committee of the East India Company informed the Government of India that if necessary they would ' not disapprove of your entering into an engagement with the Chief of Bahrein to protect him against encroachments from Mehemet Ali, but we concur in the doubt expressed by Captain Hennell [then Political Resident] as to whether it wovdd be expedient for that island to be taken under the protection of the British Government.' On 24th February 1840 the Foreign Office wrote to the India Board (with reference to an enquiry from the Bombay Government) that it was important that the Egyptian troops should not be allowed to take possession of Bahrein and that if the Company's troops could occupy it, even provisionally, such a measure could not fail to be attended with advantage. On the retirement o£ the Egyptians from Hasa in 1840 their relations with the Sheikh came to an end. Summary, 1830-40. 36. From 1831—33 Bahrein was subject and tributary to the VVahabi Amirs.

But immediately after she formally acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and paid tribute to Egypt. The visit of the Persian envoy had thus no effective sequel. VI.—1840 50. 3/. In J-S-iO the Government of India, provoked by the attitude which the Sheikh had adopted, decided not to xestiam the Imam of Muscat in the event of his wishing to conquer Bahrein. On 27th March 1840 the Secret Committee remaiked to the Government of India ' We consider our- No. 591, selves . . . relieved from all regard to the interests of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and we should be glad to hear that his 394 island was in possession of a friendly chieftain.' . j.lowaids the end of 1840 the Imam of Muscat India Board informed the Resident that while his views in regard to letter &gt; Bahrein remained unaltered, he had been restrained from giving effect to them by his impression that Her Majesty's Government were averse to the prosecution of his claim and that without their assistance or that of the Egyptians, he would have no chance of success. Expulsion of Sheikh Abdullah. Succession of Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa (1843-68). 39. Internal dissensions in the Sheikhdom between the ruler, Sheikh Abdullah, and his grand-nephew and co- ruler, Sheikh Mohamed, became increasingly bitter, and Sheikh Mohamed was finally expelled from the island. In November 1842 he was given permission by Her Majesty's Lor. I, 866. Government to attack Sheikh Abdullah. After a civil war which lasted from January to April 1843, Abdullah was expelled by Mohamed, who thereafter held the Sheikhdom, no reply being sent to an appeal to restrain the attackers which was made by Abdullah to the British authorities in February 1843. Intrigues of ex-Sheikh, 1843-49. 40. Between 1843 and 1849 the ex-Sheikh appealed at various times for the assistance of the Wahabis, the Trucial Sheikhs, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the British and Persian authorities to enable him to recover his position. In 1843 Lor. I, 873. Her Majesty's Government dissuaded Muscat from trying to conquer Bahrein—considerations which weighed with them being inter alia the risk of provoking the Wahabis and the danger of giving Persia an excuse to espouse the cause of the ex-Sheikh. In the same year the ex-Sheikh twice visited Bushire, where he failed to find any consolation from the Resident, who, on his stating that if disappointed by Her Majesty's Government he was ready to throw himself into the arms of Persia, informed him (October 1843) that the adherence of Persia to his cause would not be recognised by Britain unless it was open and declared. 41. In the course of his visits the ex-Sheikh entered into discussions with the nephew of the Persian Sheikh of Bushire, who, while holding no official position himself,12 promised him military assi^ from ^ sentations being thereup . , Tehran the Prime Minister by Her Majesty s ^ Suleiman had acted with Minister informed P Interfered in political affairs ^llbn^adrd teBXrin belonged to Persia and that.

It may be recorded that on a jecond ex-Sheikh to Bushire from December lu43 to Maich 18 , he is stated to have been received Math distinction by th Persians, and to have offered, if reinstated to gay the cost, to remit in future a large annual tribute to the Shah and to leave one son as a hostage in Persia. His proposals were not, however, accepted by the Persian Government. 43. In 1844 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed by the Government of India to resist by force anv attempt by Persia to establish troops on the island oi P .O. to Teh., Bahrein. During the same year the ex-Sheikh, having, while No. 23, of residing at Naband in South Persia, captured_ two Bahrein! 21.8.1844. vessels, the ruling Sheikh appealed to the Resident, with the Hertslet, 6. resu i t that an injunction was issued by the Central Persian Lor.

Views of His Majesty's Government on Persian Claim and on future Policy, 1844-45. 44. Consequent on indications that Persia intended to- intervene in the succession at Bahrein on behalf of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah the general question of policy was considered by Her Majesty's Government in the early part of 1844, in the light of an intimation by the Government of India that they would see the strongest objections to- any such interference by Persia, which could not but react adversely on British interests. As a result, Her Majesty's Minister was informed (Foreign Office Despatch to Tehran,. No. 23, dated 1st May 1844) that ' the question of the right of Persia to interfere and of the Indian Government to prevent interference necessarily depends upon the validity of the pretension put forward by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Her Majesty's Government are ignorant of the grounds of such pretension, and, assuming those grounds to be insufficient, they would claim for the British Govern ment the right to prevent, if it accorded with its policy to- do so, any direct interposition of Persia in the quarrels of rival claimants to the possession of Bahrein. The British Government in India at present consider that any such disturbance as may be occasioned by military operations on the part of Persia directed against the island of Bahrein would be injurious to British interests, and, therefore, unless Persia can show that she has a clear and indis putable right to the sovereignty of Bahrein; that she has exercised it without interruption under the dynasty of the Kajar family ; that consequently her present policy is directed to the maintenance of her lawful claims and not to the assertion of a pretension not founded on law, she must be13 I j ^n![t e - d t0 rr Un R er K a n y SchemGof this killd the active opposition of the British Government in India.' In these circnmstances the Minister was instructed to inform the Persian Government that 'Her Majesty's Government had heard with regret that that Government contemplated taking part in the disputes respecting the Government of Bahrein • that such a proceeding would be viewed with much jealousy by the Bntish Government in India; and that unless the right of 1 ersia to interfere in the matter is beyond dispute any interference on her part might lead to unpleasant discussions with England. For, although Her Majesty's Government do not dispute the right of Persia as an independent power to adopt any line of policy not inconsistent with its engagements to foreign states which she might think advantageous to herself, they claim for themselves a corresponding right to judge and act in such matters as they may think fit.' Discussions with Persia, 1844-45. 45. On a communication in these terms being made to Teh. to F.O., the Persian Prime Minister, the Prime Minister ' said he No. 69 of would undertake to prove the right of Persia to possession 22.6.1844. of that island, and that in the meantime he would not make any movement against it without giving previous notification of such an intention to the British Government.' 46. In February 1845 the Minister at Tehran sent home Tell to Fi0- a letter received from the Prime Minister, from which it iSTo. 19 of appeared that the Persian claim was essentially based on the 25.2.1845. Convention of 1822 between Captain Bruce and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Fars. (See paragraphs 20-21 above.) 47. In a subsequent despatch the Minister said that he Teh. toJf .O., had informed the Prime Minister that the Bruce Agreement N 0 ; 28 of was unauthorised and had been repudiated at the time, and 18 - 3 - 1845 - that the Prime Minister had thereupon sent him a fuller statement of the grounds of the Persian claim. The result of enquiries which His Majesty's Minister had made con sequent on the receipt of this statement ' confirmed me in the opinion that this island has not formed part of the dominions of Persia since the accession of the Kajar dynasty [1795]. It is true that the Chiefs of Bahrein have in all probability from time to time given offerings, or tribute to this country [Persia] as a mark of superiority, as Eandahar and Herat continue to do, without an acknow ledgment of subjection,®' and it is also not unlikely that the rulers of that island may have declared themselves to be subjects of the Shah when threatened with subjugation from Bagdad, but I cannot ascertain that Persia has exercised any real control over it within the last 50 or 60 years.' The Minister added that in further support of their claim the Persian Government had sent him a gold coin struck at Bahrein in 1817 in the name of Fateh Ali Shah Kajar, which he believed to be genuine. 48. The fuller statement of claim put forward by the Secret Oom- Persian Government was investigated by the Secret Com- ^Control^' mittee of the East India Company, who, after detailed 31.7.1845.' examination of it, reached the conclusion ' that Persia has no legitimate claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein.' It may be remarked that the Persian claim was largely based on a general claim that the Persian Gulf from the Shatt-el- Arab to Muscat and all the islands in it belonged to * On this point the Secret Committee of the East India Company remarked : ' Presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia.' (Secret Committee to India Board, 31st July 1845.) 2953 D14 Persia; that the employment m English of the term ' Persian Gull' was itself evidence of this; that from about 1300 A.D. the island of Bahrein had always been in the possession of the Governors of Fars and had paid revenue to them until its conquest in 1783 by the Uttabi Arabs, from which tribe 'itself, likewise, presents have generally been sent to the Governors of Fars' ; that Her Majesty's Government had recognised the position when they warned Mehemet Ali of Egypt in 1840 not to attack Bahrein, which did not form part of Arabia, but rather of the Persian Gulf ; 'and that accordingly the British Govern ment would not allow him to extend the hand of possession over that island ' ; that the British authorities had formally and repeatedly asked Persia to rent the island to them and that British representatives at Tehran had frequently declared that Her Majesty's Government had no right what ever to the Gulf or its islands [there is no foundation for either statement]; aud that the fact that Captain Bruce's treaty was on record supported the Persian claim. The following extract, which (except as regards the initial date) appears correctly to represent the true facts, may, however, be placed on record from the Prime Minister's memorandum : ' In the commencement of the reign of His Majesty the late Shah, the Arabs of Beni Attabi came from the desert and conquered the island by sea. The object and desire of the Persian Government has since always been and is the recovery of that island from its spoilers.'' 49. Her Majesty's Government, in view of the unlikeli hood that Persia had, or could'give effect to, any serious designs in Bahrein and the undesirability of engaging in those circumstances in a correspondence which might merely cause irritation without serving any useful purpose, instructed the Minister at Tehran not to revert to the subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian Prime Minister. In that case he was to employ certain arguments supplied to him (apparently the critical comments of the Secret Committee of the East India Company on the Prime Minister's memorandum) to show generally the grounds on No^SfTof e ^' H er Majesty's Government were ' unable to recognise 7.81845. as va lid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and you may add that they would . . . very much disapprove of any attempts on the part of Persia to interfere in the affairs of that island and thus disturb the peace of the Gulf and to afford an opening to piracy.'

The overtures made by the Turks in 1847 gave rise between 1847 and 1849 to consideration by the Government of Bombay, the Government of India, and Her Majesty's Government of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein. The cheikh hinted in 1847 that unless certain grievances t t qqi were met he might become a Turkish subject. His T , 0r ' ' grievances were accordingly remedied by the Government H,es. 334 of of Bombay. That Government represented, however, that it 31.7.1847. was_ desirable to exclude interference in Gulf affairs by foreign Powers, since unless Her Majesty's Government retained the supreme _ control they could not secure the permanence of the objects (the suppression of piracy, &amp;c.) on which so much money had been ,spent. The Court of Directors concurred in the Government of Bombay's recommendation ' that any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British Naval Force' and that the Hesident should be so informed. 55. On 11th October 1847 the Foreign Office, in a letter to the India Board, in which they referred to recent Turkish assurances that the Turkish Government had no intention-of using compulsion with regard to Bahrein, added that ' if the Indian Government has any further apprehensions on the subject, and if the Bahrein Chief is really an independent ruler, the best course would be to make with him a treaty of alliance which would secure his independence and his friendly connection with England.' The Resident, who deemed it inexpedient that Her Majesty's Government should involve itself in the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein (letter of 25th January 1848), was, however, opposed to making the existing connection closer, as were the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who expressed the view that the Resident ' had exercised a wise discretion in not taking any step for the negotiation of a new treaty with Bahrein.' The Resident was, at the same time, authorised, while avoiding discussion with the Turks, to ascertain whether the Sheikh was inclined to enter into a closer connection with Her Majesty's Government. Sheikh's Request to be taken under British Protection refused (1849). 56. In January 1849, however, the Sheikh spontaneously l j0r -1&gt; ^82. asked to be taken under British protection.

In June 1849 the Imam of Muscat, haying intimated his dp'sire to send an expedition to take possession of Bahrein, and having asked the opinion of Her Majesty s Government, was strongly dissuaded from doing so by Her Majesty s Government. Summary, 1840-50. 59. The ruling Sheikh was expelled in 1843 ^ and con tinued to intrigue to regain the throne till his death in 1849, appealing for assistance during this period to the Wahabis, Persia, Muscat and Great Britain, in all cases unsuccessfully. In' \ 84? Turkey asserted a claim to Bahrein. In the same year the islands submitted themselves to the Wahabi Amir and agreed to pay tribute to him. Claims by Persia were advanced, but rejected, in 1844- 45 and 1848. Muscat was dissuaded from attacking Bahrein in 1849.^ Her Majesty's Government, on consideration of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein, decided against establishing a protectorate and refused a request put for ward in 1849 by the Sheikh to be taken under British protection. They assured him at the same time of their general goodwill, and their deliberations made it clear that they regarded the island as independent, but were reluctant to assume further responsibility in relation to it so long as its independence and the performance of the engagements undertaken by the Sheikh could be secured without their doing so. VII.—1850-61. Disputes with Wahabis, 1850-51. 60. In 1850 the Resident found it necessary to take disciplinary action against the ruling Sheikh—an individual of ' irresponsible character.' Consequent on strained relations between the Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir, the Amir, with whom the sons of the ex-Sheikh Abdulla were associated, in 1850-51 threatened Bahrein, whereupon the Sheikh ' against his own better judgment . . . tendered a small annual tribute to the Amir,' a circumstance from which it may perhaps be inferred that he had failed to observe the agreement of 1847 referred to in paragraph 50 above. The Amir rejected the offer and made exorbitant demands instead. Ihe Sheikh was about to succumb to a combination of the sons of the ex-Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir when a British squadron arriving off Bahrein took the islands under their protection.' Peace was subsequently made with the Wahabis in July 1851. Hee Majesty s Government and the Claims of Turkey (1851). , . s ^ me y ear Her Majesty's Government decided that the 1 urkish Government should be informed at Con- stantmop] e that Her Majesty's Government, having heard a tne bheikh was desirous of placing himself under ur usn protection, could not acknowledge or acquiesce in any sue arrangement, seeing that the Government of British n la a had relations with Bahrein as an independent17 State and had concluded with it pfn-tofr. + a* t in 1820 for the ^ tam treaties, namely, one India Bd the prohibition nf ?K n / pirac y ^nd one in 1847 for to F.O., ine pronibition ot the exportation of slaves and tW Hov 7.2.1851.

Principle of Nox-interferekce in Internal Affairs laid down by Bombay Government (1854). . 0n 20 th November 1854 the Government of Bombay 3ii a letter to the Resident laid down the principle of non-^ interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein, and authorised the Resident simultaneously to inform the Sheikh of Qatif on the Aiab mainland that the British Government would not tolerate his further interference with the affairs of Bahrein. Slavery Agreement with Her Majesty's Government (1856). 65. On the 10th May 1856 an agreement supplementary Aitchison, to the Treaty of 1847 (paragraph 51 above) regarding the Vol. XI, ' slave trade was made with the Sheikh. Its contents were ;No - ix ' 234 - identical with that of corresponding engagements entered into at the same time by the Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast. 66. The Sheikh's internal government continued to go from bad to worse. In September 1858 reparation was secured from him for the ill-treatment of British subjects in Bahrein. In 1859 a Wahabi attack was averted by British intervention. The local Wahabi Governor sued for pardon Lor. 1, 887. to the Senior Naval Officer; the Wahabi ruler, however, made a formal protest, asserted his authority over Bahrein, and declared that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey. The Resident, in reply, informed him of the determination of Her Majesty's Government to preserve the independence of Bahrein, and pointed out the inconsistency of his piratical attacks on Turkish shipping with his professions of dependence on the Ottoman Government. Sheikh's Appeal to Persia and Turkey, 1859-61. 67. At the end of 1859 or early in 1860, as the result,. Lor. I, 888. apparently, partly of apprehensions of the Wahabis and partly of irritation at the restraint exercised by the Resident 2953 E18 Resdt. to over his piratical activities directed against the Wahabis, Bombay, tlie Sheikh made a simultaneous appeal for assistance to the No - 118 '. Persian Governor of Fars and the Turkish Wall of Baghdad. No' The Turkish answer was delayed. A Persian agent (M.rza Siseb ; Slehdi Khan), bearing a Persian F.rman to the Sheikh, arrived No. 219, in Aoril 1860. The Persian flag was hoisted, lersian sovereignty proclaimed, and the Sheikh's agreement to pay SrL tribute seeured. These ceremonies were, however, scarcely No So, over when a Turkish emissary arrived. I he Persian flag 16 7.1860. continued to fly during the Sheikh s negotiations with the Resdt. to Turks but on the latter withdrawing, and subsequently JmsSx communicating assurances of a character satisfactory to the Sheikh from the Turkish Government, the Turkish flag was hoisted on the forts in place of the Persian flagm May 1860 and the Sheikh agreed to pay tribute to lurkey. Ihe Persian emissary, however, refused to leave Bahrein or surrender his imaginary authority in the Sheikhdom. ine Resident reported in July 1860 that ' the Ottoman flag has now become the national one.' The Sheikh appears to have endeavoured to play off each party against the other. Views of the Minister o 68. The Minister at Tehran regarded the matter as one of relatively small importance. He pointed out to the Persian Government ' that under no circumstances can the British Government be expected to concur in the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the Persian Crown, since we have contracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the mainten ance of their independence is indispensable to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish ' ; and obtained an assurance from Persia that no Teh. to Bu. military occupation of Bahrein should be attempted until ^o- 16 ° f the title to the island had been settled through the diplomatic channel. He advised the Resident that, while hostilities against Bahrein were to be repelled by force, a voluntary tender of allegiance by the Sheikh to any other Power might, so long as it was unaccompanied by any military occupation, be ignored as of no particular importance. In the light of the Minister's views the Government of Bombay instructed the Resident that he should not interfere with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Persia or Turkey, save by protest and by an intimation that the matter had been referred to Her Majesty's Government; but at the same time that the agents of both Powers (Turkey and Persia) should be warned that aggression by or in the name of Bahrein on neighbour ing tribes would not be allowed and would, if necessary, be Dec. 1860. prevented by force. In representing the matter to the Secretary of State for India they urged that in the interests of the peace of the Gulf it would be better that Bahrein should be regarded as independent and as subject neither to Turkey nor to Persia, that its independence should be recognised, and the engagements into which in the interests of humanity we had entered, with its rulers for the preservation of the peace and good order of the Gulf should be maintained. Her Majesty's Government decide that Bahrein shall be regarded as independent (1861). 69. In February 1861 tier Majesty's Government, after t 1 0 to 10 lscuss ^ ori between the India Office and the Foreign Office, 12.2.61. ' ''PP 1 oved the recommendation of the Government of S. of S.toG. _ ombay. The Resident and the Minister at Tehran were so 2 ' ln ^ 01i y ie ^- During part of the time at any rate that the question was under consideration in London the Turkish an ^ ersian agents or their representatives appear (though it is not clear how consistently) to have remained in ahrem, and the flags of both Powers to have been flown19 simultaneously. On the 27th Februarv 1861 the Political flv ™Th r t ep r f ^ at ' ? he J Pers:an Turkish flags still fly on t..e forts of the island and m an interview that Com mander Cruttenden had with Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah at his tW q - U 6 Chl ® f) re marked in respect to them WL t fvi T 61-6 disiplajed'merely to suit his own fancy. What did he care for Turk or Persian? He valued the niendship of the British Grovernment highly.' ' British Convention of 31st May 1861 with the Sheikh. ^ Ma n y - t 1 ^ e Sheikh, refusing to discontinue a blockade which he had imposed on the Wahahi coast, was informed by the Resident of the decision of Her p 0 i R . es Majesty s Government that he was regarded as an indepen- to'Sheikh, dent Ohief and that m these circumstances he must be held 25.5.1861, responsible by them for any piratical activities in which he might indulge. The Sheikh proved obdurate; he was threatened with forcible measures by the Resident and two or his ships were seized. He accordingly submitted, and on 31st May 1861 he signed a Friendly Convention with the Resident, acting on behalf of EJer Majesty's Government, by which he entered into a 'perpetual treaty of peace and friendship ' with Great Britain, and in which, as ' indepen dent ruler of Bahrein,' he acknowledged as valid and in force the earlier conventions entered into between Bahrein and Her Majesty's Government, and undertook in return for a guarantee of protection against aggressions ' by the Chiefs and Iribes of the Gulf ' to abstain from maritime aggression, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c., and to agree to Aitchison, certain conditions in regard to residence and trade in Vol. xr, ' Bahrein by British subjects and to jurisdiction over them. No. x, 234. One of the ships seized from him was thereupon returned; the second, the Hamrah, was retained. 71. The Turkish and Persian agents would seem to have p 0 i. Res. to disappeared from Bahrein before the Resident's arrival. The Teh., No. 20, Persian authorities at Bushire in June 1861 asked the 8-6.1861. Resident for an explanation of his proceedings. The Resident, however, contented himself with forwarding their enquiry to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. The Convention was approved by the Government of India in 1861, and the Turkish and Persian Governments were informed of what had happened. Summary, 1850-61. 72. The Turkish Government were informed in 1851 that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any claim on their part to Bahrein. The Sheikhs appear to have continued to pay tribute to the Wahabi Amir in the early part of and possibly through out this period. In 1859 the Sheikh appealed simultaneously to Turkey and to Persia, as the result of apprehensions of a Wahabi attack, and received a Persian envoy, who hoisted the Persian flag. On the arrival immediately afterwards of the Turkish envoy the Persian flag was hauled down. Sub sequently the Sheikh for a time flew both flags side by side. The envoys seem to have left Bahrein in the early part of 1861. No action was taken by the British authorities pending a decision by Her Majesty's Government as _ to whether they regarded Bahrein as independent. The Persian Government undertook not to endeavour to occupy the islands until the title to them was settled. Her Majesty's Government decided in February 1861 to regard the Sheikh as an independent ^ ruler and so hold him responsible for piracies, &amp;c. Punitive action against him by Her Majesty's Government having proved necessary in May 1861, he entered in that month into a convention with them in which he was described as 'independent ruler of Bahrein,' and secured certain guarantees of protection.20 ttttt 1861—67 From the Convention of 1861 to the Punitive Expedition of August 1868. Persian Protest (1862). 73 In January 1862 the Persian Minister in Paris LordCowle, tested t0 Her Majesty's Ambassador in Paris against the No. is,' seizure of the Hamrah. He was informed in reply that Her 7.7.1862. Maiesty's Government could not recognise any claim on the F.O. to Lord J of p ersia t0 quest ion their proceedings in regard to ^209, Bahrein, and must therefore decline to offer him any 22.2.1862. explanation on the subject of his complaint. Persian Protest (1866). Lor I 891 74- Between 1863 and 1865 the Sheikh continued to 01 ' ' ' misbehave, and in the latter year his ship, the was seized under the instructions of the Resident. The Persian Government in 1866 made a complaint in regard to the Dinar proceedings on the ground that Bahrein under the unratified agreement of 1822 was a dependency of Persia. The Government of India, after ascertaining from the Government of Bombay the nature of the agreement of 1822, Lor. 1,691. communicated the result of tneir enquiries to the Minister at Tehran, and added their own opinion that ' whatever might have been the pretensions of Persia or the grounds of the same to the sovereignty of Bahrein in former days, the Shah could not now be regarded as possessing in point of I.O. to fact any rights in the principality.' This communication Gr. of I., was approved by Her Majesty's Government in the same •28 0 21867 y ear . ari( l the matter appears to have dropped. Nature of Relations between Bahrein and Wahabi Amir (1867). 75. In 1866-67 the Resident, on the instructions of the Government of India, investigated the relations of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Wahabi Amir. He reported as a result that the Sheikh claimed to be independent so far as his islands were concerned, and that the annual tribute of 4,000 dollars ' which he indubitably paid ' (cp. paragraph 50 above) to the Amir was on account of the possessions held by him in Qatar on the Arabian mainland, the object of the Lor. I, 892. payment being to secure those possessions against attacks by Arab tribes under Wahabi influence. The Government of India, in the light of the Resident's investigation, expressed the view in March 1867 that the Sheikh was independent of all other Powers in respect of his insular possessions and owed fealty to the Wahabis only in regard to Qatar, Summar 1861-67. 76. This period is marked by assertions of the Persian claim in 1862 and 1866. Her Majesty's Government on both occasions made it clear that they could not regard that claim as well founded. Investigation showed that the tribute still paid (1867) by the Sheikh to the Wahabi Amir was in respect of Bahreini possessions on the mainland of Arabia, and not in respect of Bahrein, which the Sheikh held independently of all other Powers. IX.—Discussions and Incidents, 1868-70. i-7. Questions of considerable importance as bearing on the status of Bahrein arose in 1868—70 consequent on— {a)the disciplinary action taken by the Government of India against the ruling Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, in view of his breaches of the Maritime ' Truce of 1820, which resulted in his flight from Bahrein I? September 1868 and the succession as sole feheikh of his brother. Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa ; ( ) the punitive action taken at Bahrein by the Govern ment of India in November—December 1869, consequent on the invasion of Bahrein by the ex-oheikh Md. bin Khalifa, the murder of Sheikh21 Sheikh^WnTM n k heikh Md ' bil ' Khalifa Md contol of thelsknds t0 tIleffiSelveS ' the ^declarations 0 ma^e Tnfhe coute^of t0 indicating the view held bv Hpr * p s ® ^^c^ssions as the statu! of Bah^iJ; on tures to Persia had been made by the rulint; Sheikh AH bin Khahfa, and by the ex-Sheikh.

The Sheikh sent an agent to Bushire to satisfy the Resident but the agent having no powers from his master, his mission proved fruitless, and he returned to Bahrein in August 1868. An armed expedition was thereupon sent against the Sheikh Bah^.fThfsfTtt fl' W t i at a 763 , 1 '* it reached Bushire Bahrein the Sheikh fled to the Arab mainland, and he was Desp. 3 of thereafter regarded by the people of Bahrein and by Her 25.9.1868. iViajesty s Government as having abdicated the Sheikhdom itie expedition found it unnecessary to use any force a fuli submission being made on its arrival by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, brother of Sheikh Mohamed, who had previouslv been associated with Sheikh Mohamed to some extent in the bbeikhship. An agreement was reached by the Political Resident with Sheikh Ali, which disposed of the matters in dispute, on 6th September 1868. The agreement was signed by ' Ali ^ bin Khalifah and the inhabitants and subjects of Bahrein. It declared inter alia that ' Md. bin Khalifah having repeatedly committed acts of piracy and other irregularities at sea, and having now, after his recent Aitch. XI piratical acts, fled from Bahrein, has forfeited all claim to No - xi ' his title as principal Sheikh and Chief of Bahrein.' 236 - 7 - 80. Subsequently to the conclusion of this agreement the Resident, by way of punishment, destroyed the fort of Muharraq by gunfire and burnt certain vessels of war belonging to Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifah. His despatch, Pol. Res. to 'wnich contains a detailed report on tlie course of events, 0 f makes no reference to any flying of the Persian flag by S 0111 ^' Mohamed bin Khalifah, and the bombardment of Muharraq 25 0 91868 and the punitive destruction of the warships took place after the submission of Bahrein, and so after Mohamed bin Khalifah had fled from the islands. Persian Protest, November 1868. 81. The facts appear to be as stated in the preceding paragraph. It was some time before a full account of these proceedings reached either India or London. Meanwhile, as will be seen from the correspondence, extracts of which Teh. Desp. are quoted below, the action of the Government of India to G - ° f I -; drew a vigorous protest from the Persian Government. The 28 - 1Cu868 - protest, after appealing to the treaties concluded between Teh. Desp. England and Persia in 1809, in 1814, in 1822 (unratified) 149 of and in 1857, urged that the Resident, instead of respecting the rights of Persia in the Gulf to the extent provided for in those treaties, had, without any prior intimation to the Persian authorities, attacked Bahrein, which island had been and still was the property of Persia ; had bombarded and destroyed the Governor's fort and house and caused considerable damage ; had appointed the Sheikh's brother 2953 JTas Governor over the island on the flight, throngh tear, o£ the Sheikh ; had imposed a fine ; and had reqmred the new Sheikh to find his brother and deliver him up to the British authorities. These proceedings had taken place at a time when 'Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah, the Governor o£ Bahrein, was openly avowing his submission to and dependence upon Persia and declaring that he considered Bahrein to be indisputably Persian, in proof of which the Persian flag was flying over his fort.' , TO 82. Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran was instructed ^18*9 to communicate a suitable explanatory statement to the Persian Government. The foreign Office suggested,_ how ever that it might be advisable, m the event of similar proceedings again becoming necessary, that communication should be had with that Government. While this question was still under consideration a formal protest against the Resident's action was received (11th February 1859 from the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London, who complained, inter alia, that the Resident had sunk three ships belonging From Gen. to the Governor of Bahrein and fired on his palace on which IVIolisin ^0 Persian flag flew, and requested that the oritish vrovern- Khan, + wou y pive orders for the repair of the damage caused. To g S 69 ' He was informed in reply that ' the Sheikh of Bahrein was Mohsin' an independent chief with whom the British Government Khan, treaty engagements and whom they must hold strictly 5.3.1869. t0 tlie performance of those engagements.' Gen. Mohsin 83. This contention the Persian representative disputed, Khan to ail( j j n SU pport of his view he forwarded letters addressed Dafeof a ;from t . 0 1^09 by the Sheikh of Bahrein to His Imperial 13.41869. Majesty the Shah and the Prince Governor of Shiraz.' The translations of these letters are dated 9th April and 12th April 1869 respectively. From internal evidence it seems probable that they were, however, written in 1860 on the occasion of the visit to Bahrein of the Persian envoy, Mirza Mehdi Khan (paragraph 67 above). They acknowledge the receipt of a Firman from the Mirza (apparently recognising Sheikh Md. as Sheikh and accompanying a Firman and a Sword of Honour for Sheikh Ali). They state emphatically that Bahrein forms part of Persia, and has always done so. They refer to an agreement reached for the future payment of tribute; remark that ' the slight neglect which was lately shown on our part towards Your Imperial Majesty's Government was because they had not for a while superin tended and protected us, but as now the Government of Your Imperial Majesty has intended by sending over Mirza Mehdy to enquire into and manage the affairs here, I, with my brother and all the inhabitants, feel quite ready to declare at once that we are most willing to render any services required from us towards Your Majesty's Government, being already aware that Bahrein (Persian Gulf) is part of Persia,' and add ' . . . I will hasten to hoist the flag on my residence bearing the Lion and the Sun which are the signs of the Persian Standard.' British Note o! 29th April 1869. 84. The question of the reply to be given to this further protest was carefully considered between the India Office 10 to F 0 and tl:ie ^ orei S n Office. The Duke of Argyll, then Secretary 21.4.1869. ' State for India, remarked that although he was of opinion that the line of policy which had hitherto been pursued of regarding the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent sovereign, and of refusing to recognise the right of sovereignty advanced by Persia, as had been done in 1845, 1848 and 1860, could not now be abandoned without very serious risk of endangering the peace of the Gulf, yet that he was not blind to the expediency of avoiding all causes of unnecessary irritation at the Court of Tehran and that23 lie was willing, therefore, should Lord Clarendon desire it t 'TT t0 ^ PerSi ? n G --n m ent to issue mstiuctions to the Government of India to direct the Resident in the Persian Gulf (whenever he might on anv future occasion under orders from India, be about to caU the Chiex of Bahrein to account for any breach of his eneaoe ments with the British Government) to notify the fact toX Government 8 ' 61 ^ ^ehranfor the information of the Shah's v wu n •. Glrcutl ! s tances might, however, arise in atd oi^r C ^ general illterests of Peace and older be called upon to act promptly on his own responsibility, and m such cases the Secretary of State was not willing to waive what he considered ' as not only a ri^ht m ^ pertaining to but a duty incumbent upon, the British oyernment. The Foreign Office concurred in these views Khan™ ana the .Persian representative was informed accordingly. 29.41869. nffi 85 'i The ^•sian representative on receipt of the Foreign f. O . toLO. Office lettei asked that m order to make it more palatable 11.5.1869. to the Shah, certain modifications should be made in it. L0 - to After private discussion between Lord Clarendon and the P ^ q ^ q 9, Duke of Argyll, of which no record exists, and an interview between the Envoy and Lord Clarendon, it was finally agreed to accept the modification embodied in the opening para- 0f tlle letter which Allows, but also to make the addition contained in the last paragraph of that letter; and a letter so amended was despatched to him. The text (omitting an introductory paragraph) of the amended letter, which is of importance as one of the principal pieces of evidence subsequently adduced by the Persian Government m support of then claim that Her Majesty's Government have recognised Persian sovereignty over Bahrein, is as follows. The sentences in italics are those which were added in deference to the further representations from General Mohsin Khan referred to above 'The British Government Government of the Shah has Persian right of sovereignty over by the British Authorities, and consideration to that protest. it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are un doubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different perfods entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for the purposes of preventing Piracy and Slave Trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty; but, if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties, Her Majesty's Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged by impunity. ' I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty's Government towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah ; and, in regard to this question, I have the honour to state to you that, whenever it is practicable to do so. Her Majesty's Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein may have rendered necessary.

Her Majesty's Minister reported on 14th November 5.10.1869. a conversat io n on this incident with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of which the latter admitted that Persia had not acquired sufficient power or authority in that part of the Gulf to enable her to repress acts of piracy and to maintain order, but Tell. Desp. ^ded that he hoped that before long the Shah's authority 1411 1869. would be fully established at Bahrein, when full redress would be given for losses suffered through the recent events, and that in the meanwhile it would not be considered necessary that the British authorities should undertake coercive measures. Her Majesty's Minister further reported that ' Ali bin Khalifa having forwarded letters to this Court admitting his allegiance to the Shah and offering his services to the Persian Government,' an agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan, who had been Persian Envoy to Bahrein in 1859 (para graph 67 above)) had been despatched with a Royal Firman, recognising Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah as Chief of Bahrein, but that on receipt of the news of the murder of the Sheikh by the ex-Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, the Firman had been recalled and the name of the ex- Sheikh substituted (from paragraphs 94-5 below it will be seen that these statements subsequently proved to be incorrect in material particulars). British Punitive Expedition (November—December 1869). 88. Punitive operations consequent on the murder of Sheikh Ali were undertaken by the British Government in November of the same year. Previous notification was given to the Persian Government of the grounds of this expedition, the object of which was stated to be ' to call the chief now Pol. Res. to in possession of Bahrein to account for his breach of the unise? maritime P eace and for tlle attack on Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah, who had been placed in power by the British Government.' 15.11.1869. 89. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on receipt of the notification in question stated that the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who had, he said, been the cause of the recent disturbances, had been killed (this was in fact incorrect); that the Resident's action would therefore be useless, and that the Persian Government hoped that he would be telegraphically instructed not to proceed to Bahrein. He added that the Persian Government would themselves keep the affairs of Bahrein by land in order and that should anything happen to affect its affairs by sea they would Teh. Desp. request the British Government to send a 'naval force to put 1611 1869 t &gt; i, 118 - 11 u ^ £ U -P ^ now state of affairs in .xwy. Bahrein had not fallen into disorder.' 90.

Ihe punitive operations against Bahrein resulted in the complete submission of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah and the ex-Sheikh Md. bm Khalifah in September 1869. It may be remarked that prior to the opening of operations Sheikh Abdullah made overtures to the Resident, which were, how ever, rejected, with a view to securing recognition by His Majesty's Government. He also appealed to the Wahabi Amir for recognition and protection. Sheikh Isa bin Ali, son of the murdered Sheikh Ali, voluntarily assumed the vacant Chiefship and was recognised by the Resident on behalf of the Government of India (' in no way did Colonel Pelly influence the succession') and the ex-Sheikh and Mohammed bin Abdullah were deported to India. Shortly aftei his installation the new Sheikh received a letter from one Hydar Khan, Zabit of the Dashti district on the Persian coast, advising him to place himself under the Shah's protection, but the incident appears to have been unim portant. Peksian Protest, 1869-70. Views of Government 92. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first to have received news of the removal of the ex-Sheikh with equanimity and is said to have remarked that Persia and Great Britain had an equal interest in the maintenance of peace by sea and that Persia had therefore no reason to object to the punishment of the delinquent. But he protested in strong terms against the Resident's action in preventing the Persian agent from landing and holding communication with the Sheikh, and a still stronger protest was made by the Persian Minister in London. The Govern ment of India, in the exhaustive reports they submitted on the Resident's action, urged, after a review of the history of the islands, that the Shah had no legitimate control over the Sheikh of Bahreiy ; that his Government had nevertheless encouraged the piratical faction in the Persian Gulf by sending letters of recognition to the piratical leader; that in styling Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah Chief of Bahrein the Persian Government ignored the facts that he had never held sway in Bahrein, belonged to the younger branch of the ruling family, and so had neither by right nor possession claim to this title; and that, so far from the Shah having any just cause of complaint against the Resident, the Persian Government should be called upon to give some explanation of the conduct of its officers in encouraging a piratical expedition which was prejudicial to British interests in the Persian Gulf and for the successive appointment by them of Ali bin Khalifa and Md. bin Khalifa to the sovereignty of a district over which they had no legitimate control. The Government of India added that they had no confirmation of the alleged overtures of Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa to Persia (paragraph 87 above), as to which further enquiry was being made of Her Majesty's Minister Bushire Desp. 216 of 15.12.1869.

SunplcTii silt (it'Ij Revovts h A J 870. 94. On 6th April 1870 the Minister at Tehran reported as follows to the Government of India ;— ' In my Despatch No. 81 ... I reported that the Firman of appointment was originally in the name of Ali bin Khalifa, but that, on hearing of his death, it was altered in favour of his brother, Md. bin Khalifa. This information had reached me from a relation of . . . one of the principal Persian officials in Shiraz, and not . . . from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. When further intelligence reached Shiraz from the Gulf and it was supposed that Md. bin Abdullah would retain possession of Bahrein, the Firman was probably again altered in his favour, as it was to him that it was eventually forwarded. In conversation with the Persian Minister this afternoon His Excellency admitted that this wa« probably the case. He said that Mirza Mehdi Khan on leaving Tehran had received general instructions for his guidance respecting the Bahrein question, but that the details were settled at Shiraz and the Firman was issued in the name of the Persian Governor of Fars and not in that of the Shah. The name inserted in this document had certainly, he said, been altered once to his knowledge, and it was not unlikely that it had been changed a second time before being forwarded to its destination. ' With regard to the overtures said to have been made by Ali bin Khalifa to the Persian Government, as reported in my Despatch No. 81, I have the honour to state that that information also reached me from a private source and not from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency_ has, however, asserted very positively to me to-day that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly written to the Persian Government professing allegiance to the Shah and that a number of letters containing assurances of this kind are now in his (the Minister's) possession. ' It appears to me that on the receipt of a correspon dence which passed last April between Her Majesty's Government and the Shah's representative in London, the Persian Ministers, believing that the Bahrein Chief was himself well disposed to further their designs, resolved to take measures with a view to establishing, if possible, the Shah's authority in that quarter and make good his claim to exercise sovereign rights over Bahrein. Mirza Mehdi Khan was accordingly dispatched to Shiraz and Bushire and a certain latitude was given to him as to the mode in which he should proceed to cariy out the wishes of his Government. The Persian authorities in Shiraz finally determined that a Firman should be addressed to Md. bin Abdullah, conferring (see paragraphs 94-95 below), but in any event oonld not admit 'that snoh overtures, made without its knowledge and consent, can in any way affect its treaty relations with Ba rem. British Reply to Pers 1870. 93. Her Majesty's Minister was therefore instructed by the Foreign Office that it appeared possible that Her Majesty's Government, instead of furnishing explanations to 1 ersia, might have cause to complain '' of the proceedings of the Persian authorities in endeavouring to communicate with arK h t m hopVr~ ,i? h T t and with thi3 Chief then £ posses^ ^ matter the sole object of alfooneeSd would 'e-n to ment aTRnhr' 7 the polioyof the Per8i ™ Govern- ment at Bahrein without reference to the interests or 95 1 OnVtl^ ' T~rfl G S' emmeDtthat q'' fu 8th 1 A P riJ - 18 ' 0 the Minister at Tehrau addressed e following despatch to the Government of India : — With reference to my despatch of the 6th instant m which I stated that the Minister for Foreign a S had informed me that Ali bin Khalifa had lepeatedlv Shah Tf 111 ''? 0 n ia admittin g bis allegiance to the' thpt M J i TA n0Ur i t0 report t0 Your Excellency that Mirza bayed Khan has just sent to inform me that tie was mistaken m making this assertion, and that he on enquiry that the letters to which he referred were not from that Chief, but from Md. bin Khalifa.' Views of Government 1870. 96 The Government of India, commenting on these facts, remarked tnat Mehdi Khan appeared to have left Tehran -tV general discretion as to which of the various Sheikhs j c • i reco S n i s ed as ruler. ' At the capital no more dennite plan appears to have been resolved on than that measures should be adopted to establish the Sheikh's assumed right of sovereignty over the island.' oi. 1 he Government of India proceeded that they had already pointed out that any disposition to admit the claims of Persia would probably lead to the revival of similar claims on the part of Turkey, a result which had in fact now been brought about (cp. paragraph 99 below). ' This (i.e. the Turkish) claim rests on no better foundation than that of Persia. It was summarily rejected by Lord Palmerston in 1851 and in our opinion should not again be reopened. With equal reason the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat could claim the sovereignty of the island, if the nominal and temporary tender of allegiance, in times of difficulty, and as a security against foreign intervention, be considered sufficient ground on which to base such preten sions. On the same ground indeed we might claim Bahrein as a part of the British dominions. But, as we have repeatedly observed, the real status of the island, and the only one which we have recognised and admitted, or are prepared to recognise and admit, in all our dealings in the Persian Gulf and our negotiations with the Chiefs, is that of an independent State, subject neither to Persia nor to G Turkey, neither to the Wahabis nor to Muscat, nor yet to the British Government.' Review of Discussions 1868-70. 98. The matter ultimately lapsed. But from the facts and the correspondence summarised above it will lie seen, in the first place, that there appears to be no foundation for the alleged overtures to Persia by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, or for the statement that the Persian flag was flying at the time of the punitive expedition of 1868 ; and that if any overtures were made to Persia in 1868-69 (and there is no confirmatory evidence of any such overtures) they would appear to have been made by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, presumably in his anxiety to secure Persian support for his restoration. Secondly, while the statements contained in the Note sent by the Foreign Office on behalf of Her Majesty's Government to the Persian Charge d'Affaires on 29th April 1869 were widely phrased, and afford some justification for the interpretation placed on them by Persia, and while the Persians may have been confirmed in their view by the absence of any protest by Her Majesty's Minister against the mission of Mirza Mehdi Khan, the terms of that Note do28 not in fact, constitute more than a recognition that Persia had in the past repeatedly pressed her claim to Bahrein, and that Her Majesty's Goyernment did not claim sovereignty over that island and interested themselves in its affairs only to the extent necessary to aischarge their treaty obligations to its rulers (which included a guarantee of defence against external aggression and to ensure the peace of the Gulf. Finally, that while Her Maiesty's Government agreed to notify Persia, when circumstances permitted, before^ taking punitive action against Bahrein, on the only occasion On which (immediately after) they appear to have given effect to this undertaking, the terms of their communication made it clear that they regarded themselves as at liberty to punish the usurping Sheikhs Md. bin Abdullah and Md. bin Khalifa (in accordance with the obligations assumed by them under the Treaties of 1820 and 1861 with Bahrein) for their piratical attack on Bahrein and murder of the Chief placed in power there by the British Government. X. -1870-80. From the Turkish Occupation of Hasa to the First Exclusive Agreement. Turkish 1870. 99. In January 1870 a protest was received from the Turkish Government against the recent actions of the F.O. to I.O., Resident at Bahrein. In reply the Turkish Government 11.1.1870, were informed that Her Majesty's Government could not v'^'lj 7 90] recognise the Turkish claim to sovereignty oyer Bahrein; 0I ' ' * an(: j were courteously reminded of the intimation made to them in 1851 on Lord Palmerston's instructions (para graph 61 above). Turkish Occupation of Bahr 1871, 100. In 1871 the Turks occupied Hasa. Protests at Constantinople in April and May 1871 against rumoured Turkish designs on Bahrein resulted in a repudiation by Turkey of any such designs. The assurances received from the Turkish Government were communicated to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who had asked Her Majesty's Government for their advice and their protection against the Turks in Lor. I, 902. ]\| a y 1871, and he was informed that so long as he observed the provisions of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 above) the reciprocal obligations towards him of Great Britain would be fulfilled. 101. Protests about the same time at Constantinople led to a Turkish repudiation of the designs which the Turkish Lor. I, 919. Government were alleged to have entertained at Bahrein, and the Turkish authorities in Hasa were given instructions by their Government which debarred them from approaching Bahrein. In May 1871 the Shah enquired from Her Majesty's Representative at Tehran as to the probable effect on Bahrein of the Turkish occupation of Hasa and was informed in reply of the assurances which had been given to Her Majesty's Government by the Turks. Reply io Persian Leg meaning of Brit 1869. 102. In November 1871 the Secretary of the Persian Legation at Constantinople made enquiries of Her Majesty's Ambassador in connection with a rumour that a Turkish expedition was to be sent for the reduction of Bahrein, ' which island the Persian Secretary stated had been acknowledged by the British Government as a portion of Herfcslet, 28. the Persian dominions and ... in proof of this assertion cp. G. of I. ■' ie handed to Sir H. Elliott a copy of the note which No. 16, Lord Clarendon addressed to General Haji Mohsin Khan on 15.3,1872. 28th April 1869. Sir H. Elliott, however, observed that he29 saw m that note nothing more than an acknowledgment that the claim had previously been made, but that he was unwilling to discuss the point, as he believed there was no danger of any attempt being made to interfere with the position of Bahrein as it then stood.' Turkish Claims, 1871-79. . ^ 9 on ® e( l u . ent on the murder of a Turkish messenger m Bahrein m August or September 1871, the Turkish (jovernment demanded reparation direct from the Sheikh and received a conciliatory reply. On their demand being pressed the Sheikh, on the advice of the Resident, suggested that the matter be arranged between the British and the (j0vernmen . ts ' ^7 whose joint decision he would abide, but the Turkish Government preferred that it should be settled direct by the parties by agents. Her Majesty's Government saw no objection to such a procedure so long as no compulsion or show of force by Turkey was involved. The Turks, however, let the matter drop. The incident is of some interest as illustrating the view taken by Her Majesty's Government of the Sheikh as an independent ruler who might deal direct with foreign Powers. 104. In August 1872, a further complaint having been received from Turkey of British proceedings in regard to Bahrein and the commission of 'acts of sovereignty' on F.O. to the part of the English, the Ambassador was informed in Turkish reply that enquiries would be made into the point raised by Amba ^ador him and that his Government might rest assured that it was HeiisS so not the intention of Her Majesty's Government to interfere ^ '' ' in the affairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was imposed ^ upon them by treaty for the preservation of peace in the • / - i872 - waters The Ambassador was finally informed in April 1873, after investigation, that there were no grounds what ever for the statement that the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over Bahrein. 105. In 1874, consequent on a Turkish claim to conscript Bahreinis resident in Basra, the Turkish Ambassador in London was referred to the British Notes of J851 and 1870 (paragraphs 61 and 99 above), which stated that Her Majesty's Government did not admit the claims of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman dominions. In the same year, on a piratical attack being made on the island by certain Bahreini exiles who had signed a petition claiming Turkish protection, the Ambassador at Constan tinople handed a memorandum to the Porte in which it was stated that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any rights or pretensions of the Porte over Bahrein. In 1875 a rumour that Her Majesty's Government were forti fying Bahrein led to representations from Turkey. The L 01 '-1. rumour was unfounded and the Turks were so informed. On its becoming known about the same time that the Turks Lor - ^ themselves contemplated building a lighthouse on the island, the British Government entered a protest at Constantinople (October 1875), with the result that the project was abandoned. 106. In 1876, consequent on steps taken by the Turkish authorities to enforce the claims of Qatar merchants against Bahreinis, a Note was addressed to the Porte reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty's Government to protect Bahrein against any attack on its independence. 107. In 1879-80 the Turkish Government took up the cause of the rebels of 1869. Her Majesty's Government, after again disclaiming the exercise of sovereignty over Lor. 1,915. Bahrein, which they regarded, they said, as independent, promised to make enquiries as to certain acts of which com plaint was made by petitioners to the Turkish Government. 2953 H30 First Exclusive Agreement between Her Majesty 's Government and the Sheikh of Bahrem (1880). 108 In 1880 the Political Resident, finding that the Sheikh was disposed to conclude a special arrangement with the British Government, entered on the 2.2nd December into what is known as the First Exclusive Agreement with him Aitohison, By this Agreement the Sheikh undertook on behalf of Vol. XI, himself and his ' successors in the Government of Bahrein No.xxii, to the Bvitish Government to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to ^ establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots in our territory, unless with the consent of the British Government. This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.' The agreement was approved by Her Majesty's Government and ratified in 1881. Summar 1870-80. 109. The claims of the Wahabi Amir disappear with the subjugation of Hasa by the Turks in 1871. The Turkish claim was repeatedly pressed during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty's Government. The Persian claim appears to have been dormant. Her Majesty's Government repudiate suggestions that they have committed ' acts of sovereignty ' and continue to express their view that the Sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1880 the Sheikh entered into his first exclusive agreement with Her Majesty's Government. XI.—1880-92.

An answer £&gt;.10.1886. was prepared by Her Majesty's Government to the effect that they did not concur in His Majesty's interpretation of the communication of April 1869. They had treaty engage ments with the Sheikh, whom they considered to be indepen dent, and must hold the Sheikh to his engagements while fulfilling those they had contracted towards him. As, however, the Shah did not return to the subject, the message was not delivered. Lor. I, 911. xil. In the same year presents sent from the Persian Governor of Lar to the Sheikh were returned to the sender. 112. In 1887-88 Persian intrigues took place with a view to the establishment of Persian influence on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf.

On the 13th March 1892 the Political Resident signed a second Exclusive Agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein on behalf of Her Majesty's Government. The provisions of the Agreement (which was ratified on 12th May 1892, and. which was expressed to be binding on the oneikh, his heirs, and successors) were as follows (1) ' That I will on no account enter into any agreement Aitchkon or correspondence with any Power other than the 1^33), British Government.

In November 1892 the Ottoman Government were Const. Desp warned (apropos of the position of Bahreinis at Basra) that No. 348 of Bahrein was under British protection, and that no interference 15 - 11189 2. with its natives by the Ottoman authorities could be admitted. In the same year the Porte was informed, with reference to a rumoured intention to land Turkish troops, that such action would be opposed by Her Majesty's ships. Summary, 1880-92. 116. The Turkish claim was again pressed vigorously during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty's Government. The Shah raised the question of the Persian claim in 1886, but did not press the matter. - In 1892 the Sheikh entered into his Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty's Government.

The views of Her Majesty's Government on the status of the island were again officially repeated at Constantinople on two occasions in 1896. In 1897 the Constantinople Board of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein. The proposal was abandoned on the objections of the British delegate, who represented that Bahrein was an independent principality under British protection. 118. In 1898 a Turkish request that a British Vice- Consul alleged to have been appointed at Bahrein should32 add I v to tlie Turkish Government for his exequatur was T T cm refused on the ground that Her Majesty's Government could ' not admit the right of the Turkish Government to insist that a British Consular Officer ^ B^in should be provided with a Turkish exequatur. In 1899 the Minister at Tehran informed the French representative at that capital that since 1880 the Sheikh was precluded by treaty from holding direct relations with any Power other than Her Majesty's Government and that his subjects abroad were now under British protection. 119. A native British Agent had for a long peiiod of years been maintained in Bahrein. In 1900 a British Political Agent was appointed at Bahrein. The post has been maintained since that date, and has been nlled by an officer of the Indian Political Department since 1904. The Incident of 1901. 120. On 31st August 1901 a Belgian customs official in Lor. 1, 935- the service of the Persian Government visited Bahrein, 6. ' where he called on the Sheikh and informed him that he had been deputed by the Shall to obtain his consent to place Persian custom officials in Bahrein. An official protest was at once made by His Majesty's Minister to the Persian Government, in the course of which Sir A. Hardinge remarked that no intimation had been given to the Politic;) 1 Resident in the Persian Gulf ' of this Persian mission to an Arab State under British protection and bound by special Teh Des treaties, of which the Persian Government cannot be No. 140 of ignorant, to the Government of India ... It is my duty 18.9.1901. to place on record in the clearest maimer that His Majesty the Emperor of India cannot acquiesce in any foreign interference in the affairs of Bahrein . . . and that any attempt to disturb the relations established by treaties of long standing between those Chiefs and the Government of India will be regarded as an unfriendly act.' The Attabeg- i-Azam, in a note received on the 17th September 1901, replied : 'As I have told you verbally, M. Simais has had no instructions from the Persian Government on this matter, and if there have been any steps on his part it must have been by mistake and he will be reprimanded for it.' The Disorders of 1904-05. 121. In 1904-05, consequent on a series of attacks on Lor. I, 938- Persians and on German subjects in Bahrein, the Persians appealed to the Shah. The Persian Government replied that His Majesty's Government would take action on their behalf. The text of their telegram was as follows : To the Merchants and Traders of the High Government living in Bahrein. Your telegram on the subject of the assaults which have been made upon you by the Arab roughs of Bahrein has been received. Certainly let your minds be at rest. Con sultations with the English Legation have taken place on this subject, and it will shortly be settled in such a way that the oppression will be removed and that the offenders will receive their proper punishment.' 122. The Germans complained to the German Vice- Consul at Bushire, who made a direct request to the Sheikh for reparation, in reply to which he was referred by His Excellency to His Majesty's Government. The Sheikh was ultimately compelled by His Majesty's Government to give redress. Turkish 1904-05. 9 n rurk s pressing in 1904-05 for an explanation jor.

His Majesty's Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over ■Bahrein, ouch a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible. His Majesty's Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. 1 am further to mention that this reply has invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, who have on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein.' The Note concluded by a reference to the Persian appeal for our assistance in 1904—05 and quoted in the telegram of reassurance (paragraph 121 above) to the Persian inhabitants of Bahrein then sent on behalf of the Persian Government. 125. On 13th September 1906 the Persian Grand Vizier revived the Persian claim in a letter referring to Captain Teh. Desp. Bruce s unauthorised agreement of 1822. He was reminded 31 1907 in reply that that agreement had been expressly disavowed by His Majesty's Government and that Captain Bruce had Teh. Desp. been recalled. In a supplementary note the Grand Vizier's N' 0 ; 61 of attention was drawn to the fact that the then Shah himself 27 - 3 - 19()7 - had ' refused to recognise ' the stipulations of the Treaty of 1822, which had never been ratified, and had 'expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.' DeS p t 126. On the Ala-es-Sultaneh reviving the Persian claim, No. 179 of on the ground of the Agreement of 1822, in August 1907, 15 - 8 - 1907 - his attention was drawn in a Note dated 13th August 1907 to the Notes referred to in the preceding paragraph ; and to the fact that the Agreement had been disavoAved alike by His Majesty's Government and by the Shah. The Note added that ' since 1822 the Turkish Government have raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Govern ment, have been informed that Bahrein is under British protection.' 127. In 1908 the Persian Government, in a correspondence regarding the punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingah, intimated that instructions had been sent to Lingah that 0 reparation should be made, but added that His Majesty's Minister would admit that ' the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the island is not a matter to be disputed.' The Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A modified version was sub- sequently accepted by His Majesty's Government, which ^ was acknowledged by a Note from His Majesty s Minister, 22.1.1909. _ _ T 295334 reaffirming that His Majesty's Government maintained as regards the status of Bahreinis in Persia the position that the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants were under British protection, and that they would be guided entirely by their own views of the position should any action of the 1 ersian Government make representations necessary. 128. Early in 1910 the Persian Government assimilated the formalities to be fulfilled in the case of persons visiting Bahrein to those prescribed in the case of travellers to Persian ports, a measure which, as pointed out by the Foreign Office at the time, constituted a fresh attempt to Teh. Desp. assert Persian sovereignty over the island, but it was agreed No. 95 of i n v i ew of the undesirability of raising the general ™ question, no protest should be made to them. In July of the same year it was reported that internal Persian coastal passes issued to persons proceeding to Bahrein from Persian ports were vise by a Persian merchant residing in Bahrein. In 1912 the individual in question was forbidden to take any action in regard to the endorsement of passes held by P.G. 13: 67, Persian subjects for travelling in Bahrein. The endorse- ^ ments in question were, however, henceforth granted by the Political Resident—a practice, as pointed out by the Political Resident nine years later, 'of itself open to objection, as it might be construed into a tacit admission that the Persian passport authorities are justified in giving passes for another Persian port to persons going to Bahrein.' Withdrawal of Turkish Claim to Bahrein in Anglo-Turkish Convention o! 29th July 1913. 129. On 29th July 1913 His Majesty's Government signed a convention (whicb still awaited ratification on the outbreak of the War of 1914-18) with the Ottoman Govern ment. under which that Government renounced all their claims to the islands of Bahrein, the independence of which they recognised. His Majesty's Government on their part declared that they had no intention of annexing the islands and undertook not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr or to annex it, and to ensure that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries. The Turkish Government on their side accepted a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyah Island for fishing, and recognised the rights of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. This arrangement, followed, as it was, by the disappearance of Turkey from the Gulf after the War of 1914-18, disposed of tlie Turkish claim to Bahrein, which had been reasserted on numerous occasions and with great insistence since 1847. Summary, 1892-1913. 130. The Turkish claim was repeatedly raised during u- 6 khis period, but consistently opposed by is Majesty s Government. It was finally abandoned in the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. While that Convention was never ratified, the abandonment ot tne lurkish claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Ireaty of Lausaune of 1923. The Persian claim was also frequently pressed and was consistently repudiated in strong terms by His Majesty's Government. Xin.—1913-34. Exercise of Jurisdiction ■ Agent §8?p^62.

Persian Claim reasserted, 1922-23. m Li 1922 His Majesty's Consul at Bunder Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah had ruled that Bahremis were Persian subjects and should be given 1 ersian passports. They seized two British certificates of identity granted to Bahrein subjects, but on represents tions being made by the Minister at Tehran instructions were given by the Central Government that th^re was to be no repetition of this incident. In 1922, also, the Persian delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bnshire stated that while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia of the Bahrein post office, his action was without prejudice to the Persian claim to Bahrein. 135. In 1923, consequent on a Press campaign and a discussion in the Majliss on the desirability of giving Bahrein the right to return a member to the Persian Parlia ment, which was referred to a Commission for report, His Majesty's Government decided that it was desirable to address a formal Note to the Persian Government in terms similar to those employed in 1906 (paragraph 124 above). Owing to the difficult internal situation in Persia this proposal was dropped, but in September 1923 the Persian ^ 13 s Government was informed that the island was now a British 9 ' protectorate, and that His Majesty's Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Government of which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrein on behalf of Persia. But despite this statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs again reverted to the question in the following month. His Majesty's Government remove Misgovernment (1923). 13(5. Consequent on the gross misgovernment of Sheikh Isa, who had been ruler of Bahrein since 1869, the Sheikh was deprived by His Majesty's Government of his control of affairs in Bahrein on 26th May 1923, and was granted an pg. ^3 allowance, his son, Sheikh Hamad (whose right of succession had been recognised by His Majesty's Government in .1901) §§ 11-14 being appointed to act for him ' as his father's fully empowered agent.' Oil concession granted by S 1925. 137. In 1925 an oil concession was granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndicate, a British corporation, with the approval of His Majesty s Government.36 Aitch., XI, No. vii, 227-9. 26.11.1927.

Persian 138 The Treaty of Jedda, concluded on 20th May 1927, between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Sand, the rnler of Saudi Arabia, in substitution for the Treaty of 1915 (paragraph 133 above), provided that His Maiestv the King of the Hedjaz and of iNejd and its Dependencies' should 'maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of . . - Bahrein and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are m special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government.' Consequent thereon, a strong protest was received on 26th November 1927 from the Persian Government, copies of which were despatched to the League of Nations. The Persian protest was based essentially on the recognition stated to have been accorded to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein m Lord Clarendon s ^Note of 29th Apul lf5G9 (paragraph 85 above). A reasoned reply to the I ersian Note was despatched by His Majesty s Government on 1.8th January 1928, and circulated to the League. _ While avoiding any definite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis. His Majesty's Government in their Note repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms, and intimated that no argument such as was suggested could be based on the communication of 29th April 1869. Attitude of Sheikhs to (1928). 139. The Sheikhs of Bahrein, on being apprised of the revival of Persia's claim, gave a letter to the Political Resident, requesting His Majesty's Government in accordance with their treaties ' to defend Bahrein from outside inter ference ' and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian claims, and intimating that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohamed, brother of Sheikh Hamad, the deputy ruler, and son of the deposed ruler, Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva. Further Persian Protest, 1928. 140. On the 2nd August 1928 the Persian Government communicated a lengthy and reasoned reply to the British Note of 18th January 1928. The Note based its reiteration of the Persian claim on the principle that territory belonging to a sovereign State could definitely be detached from that State only with the consent of the State in question, which had not been given in the case of Bahrein ; and alleged that the terms of the Foreign Office Note of 29th April 1869 were con clusive evidence of the view then held of the rights of Persia by His Majesty's Government; that Bahrein had consistently recognised Persian sovereignty, as could be proved by documentary evidence, up to the date when the Sheikhs were instigated to rebellion by a foreign government; that no valid argument could be founded on the direct relations into which the Sheikhs had entered with His Majesty's Govern ment, since their action had been without the approval of their suzerain ; that the relations of Bahrein with Persia were more highly developed than with any other independent civilised country; that the Persian claim had been con sistently and uninterruptedly pressed ; and finally that even if the Treaty of 1822 was disavowed by His Majesty's Government, it was material evidence of the view held by a British officer of great experience at the time of its con clusion, and that its disavowal by the then Shah of Persia was not because of any doubt on his part as to the true status of Bahrein. 141. A reasoned reply, which examined in detail the arguments put forward by the Persian Government and leached the conclusion that they were without substance, despatched and circulated to the League at the request of His Majesty's Government on 18th February 1929.37 Assignment of Bahrein Oil Concessinn fn 1'^ i93o. 142.

' 143 Between 1928 and 1934 treaty negotiations; with a view to the conclusion of a general treaty which should .^P 0 ^ 3 0 out T &amp;taU( Iing points of difference, were in progress wi Persia, the question of Bahrein figuring prominently in those negotiations. The general attitude taken by the ersians was that Bahrein was a point of great importance to tiiem but that m return for a sufficient quid they would be prepared to abandon their claims. His Maiestv's Government on their side consistently maintained that the Persian claim was worthless, and that while they would gladly see it finally disposed of as part of a general settlement, they would not be prepared, to make any specific concession in return for its abandonment. Various formulas were worked out in discussion between His Majesty's Representatives in Tehran and the representatives of the Persian Government with a view to an agreed solution. The negotiations have, however, failed^ to reach any conclusion and are at the moment suspended without any prospect of early resumption. 144. In 1932 the Persian G-overnment protested to His P Z. 4902/33 Majesty's Government against the issue of British Indian postage stamps surcharged ' Bahrein,' and repeated their protest to the League. Their protest was rejected by His Majesty's Government, and the stamps issued in August 1933. On 22nd May 1934 a further protest against the operation of the Bahrein oil concession was addressed by p.z. 4343/34 the Persian Government to the United States Minister at Tehran, the United States Government and His Majesty's Government, and copies were circulated at the request of Persia to the League of Nations. His Majesty's Government propose to reply to this communication in a Note drawing attention to their Notes of January 1928 and February 1929 and to request the League of Nations to circulate this reply to the States Members of the League. XIV.—Conclusion. 145. It may be convenient in concluding this memoran dum on the recent history of Bahrein to summarise very briefly the claims to sovereignty over the island wliich have been advanced by various countries since 1783 ; the particular basis of those claims in the case of Persia (whose claim is alone at the present time of any importance); and the basis and development of the attitude of His Majesty s Government. A —Claims to or Assertions of Sovereignty over Bahrein, 1873 to 1934. 146 . (a) Muscat. —Bahrein subject to Muscat 1800-01, 1811? to 1816, 1820-22. Tribute paid to Muscat 1820. 2953 K33 Bahrein! independence recognised by Treaty 1829. Muscat thereafter deterred by His Majesty's Government from PUr (6) 1 %VP^—Representative of Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of Egypt, informed by Her Majesty's Government m 18^9 that no claim upon Bahrein could be admitted. But m 18.3*, 4&gt; the Sheikh acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and he paid tribute during this period. (c) Wahabi Amirs of the Mainlaud. —Bahrein under protection of or subject to Wahabi An ni ' s 1803-11 , 181(5 • 1830-33 (tributary); 1836—1838-39 (tributary;; 1847 (tributary); 1852 (tribute). In 1867 (see paragraph 75) it was held by Government of India that tribute was paid to the Wahabis only in respect of mainland possessions aud not of Bahrein. The claims of the Amirs disappeared with the conquest of Hasa by Turkey in 1871. (cZ) Turkey. —The islands have never in the period subse quent to 1783 been occupied by Turkey or (if the incidents of 1860-61 (paragraphs 67-9 above) are ignored) subject to Turkish sovereignty. But Turkish claims to them were advanced, directly or indirectly, in 1847, 1851, 1870, 1874, 1875, 1876, 1879, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1895, 1896 and 1905, and on each occasion, save in 1847, when certain assurances were given by Turkey (paragraph 52), were rejected by the British Government. The Turkish claim was finally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. That Convention was never ratified, but the withdrawal of the claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923. (e) Persia. —The Persian claim has been consistently urged on a variety of occasions through the period in question. The Sheikhs momentarily submitted themselves to Persia in 1799 and paid tribute. In 1816-17 they received a Persian envoy and apparently appealed for help to Tehran. They again momentarily submitted to Persia and received an envoy in 1839. Persian aid was invoked and a Persian emissary received at Bahrein in 1860-61, while in 1869 the deposed ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa may have made overtures to Persia (though there is no confirmation of this) to enable him to re-establish his control over the island. The Persian claim appears, apart from this, to have been asserted in 1822, 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866, 1868, 1869,1886, 1901, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1910, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1932-33 and 1934, and to have been rejected by His Majesty's Government in 1822 (as part of their refusal to accept Captain Bruce's Treaty), 1825, 1844,1848, 1861,1862, 1866-67,1869, 1901, 1906, 1907, 1908-09, 1923, 1928, ,1929, 1933 and 1934. B.—Basis of the Persian Claim. 147. Ignoring contentions such as that the use of the term ' Persian G ulf ' is a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the various islands of the Gulf, Persia has at one time or other based her claim on the nine grounds examined below :— (1) History of the Is 1783. The history of^ the islands prior to the expulsion of the Persians in 1783 is dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 above. It will be seen that at various periods since the beginning of the Christian era, Persia has exercised a degree of control over the islands, and in particular that during the 30 years piior to 1783 her control was of a more definite character. On the other hand, the facts recorded above do not support an} claim by Persia to an uninterrupted occupation or control of the islands._ 39 Persia has on various occasions in the past appealed to the early history of Bahrein in support of her claim that it is historically Persian territory. Since 1930, too, certain Persian newspapers, presumably inspired, have dealt at considerable length with the history of Bahrein in the more or less remote past, and have supported their statements by quotations from, or references to, Arab or Persian geographers or historians. Owing to the absence of records and the shortness of time available, it has been impossible to check these statements in detail, or to conduct elaborate researches into the writings of Arab geographers and others from which further information might be secured. But it is arguable that the position of the islands prior to 1783 is at most only of very indirect importance in the present connection. The essential weakness in the Persian claim is, it is suggested, that there has been, no effective exercise of authority in the islands by Persia since her expulsion in 1783, and that the Sheikhs, who originally established themselves by conquest, have now acquired a prescriptive title, based on an uninterrupted occupation of 150 years by the present ruling family. (2) The Absence of Persian of Bahrein f Persia. The Persian Government, in paragraph of their Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix B), invited attention to ' the following international juridical principle. ... A territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.' They added (correctly) that Persia has never renounced her sovereignty or ceded it to another State or ever recognised any of the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers. The argument put forward by the Persian Government under this head is examined in detail in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Note despatched by the Foreign Office on 18th February 1929 in reply to the Persian Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix 13). His Majesty's Govern ment expressed their inability to agree that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, formed part of international law. The deciding factor in the question of international title in cases in which territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign is the effective establishment by that territory of its independence, ' and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty's Government regard as wholly untenable the pro position that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence.' In paragraph 7 of the same Note His Majesty's Government cite historical precedents to show that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State ^ is not one which lias ever obtained international acceptance. ^ « (3) The U 1^22. jrS The circumstances in which the Treaty of 1822 was , e r, concluded by Captain Bruce with the representative of the olt Prince Governor of Shiraz are set out in paragraphs 20-21 r ol above. As will be seen, Captain Bruce concluded it without40 the authority of or reference to Government. The treaty into which he had entered was immediately otficialiy dis- 'ivowed and the Persian Government so informed, and Captain Bruce, as a sign of disapproval of his action, was removed from his appointment. The Persian Government on their side equally disapproved the action of the Prince Governor of Fars in entering into any treaty discussions without the prior approval of the Shah. _ [The _ Persian Government were reminded of this in 1825, 1845, 1866, 1907, 1928 and 1929.] It appears impossible in these circum stances to base any legitimate claim to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein on the provisions of the Treaty of 1822. (4) The Gold Coin alleged Bahrein 1817. Please see paragraph 47 above. A Persian Mission appears to have visited Bahrein in 1816 or 1817 (paragraph 9 above) and it is conceivable that a coin might have been struck on that occasion. On the other hand, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove that the coin had not in fact been struck elsewhere, though with an indication that it had been minted at Bahrein. The incident is in itself of relatively small importance, and it would, it is suggested, be impossible for Persia to use such an incident, even if it could be proved, save in support of arguments of much more sub stantial character. (5) Payment of Peeshkeslt, Offer Stages by Bahrein From paragraph 6 above it will be seen that tribute appears to have been paid by Bahrein to Persia in 1799. The rulers of Bahrein may also have offered to pay tribute in 1839 (paragraph 32) and appear to have offered to do so in 1860 (paragraph 67). In assessing the importance of the payment of tribute in 1799, or, if it then took place, in 1839 or 1860, it is relevant that such payment or promise of payment was immediately followed by the submission of the rulers of Bahrein, in 1800 to Muscat, in 1839 to the Egyptians, and in 1860 to the Turks. In estimating the importance of such payments as evidence of a recognition of Persian suzerainty, the arguments advanced by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran in his Despatch No. 28 of March 1845, in which Colonel Sheil remarks that the Chiefs of Bahrein ' had in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to Persia as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat still continue to do, wit subjection and the comment thereon of the Secret Com mittee of the East India Company that ' presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia' are also relevant. (6) Flying of the Persian Flag (a) The Persian flag was hoisted by the Sheikh of Bahiein in 1860. But as will be seen from paragraph 67 above, hardly had it been hoisted when, on llie arrival of 9. Turkish emissary, it was lowered and the Turkish flag' hoisted in its place. At a later stage in 1860—61 the Persian wei ' e apparently flown side by side by the Sheikh. It appears difficult in these circumstances to base any substantial argument on the incident. V -^otes addressed by the Persian envoy in London to the Foreign Office in February 1869 alleged that the Persian flag had been hoisted by Sheikh Md.' bin Khalifah and that the Resident had in September 1868 bombarded the41 Sheikh's palace on which the flag was flying. There appears to be no foundation for the suggestion that the Persian flag was flying when the Resident reached Bahrein or that it was fired on (see paragraph 80). If previously hoisted it had, by the time of the Resident's arrival, been hauled down. (c) In the undated letters from Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah communicated to the Foreign Office by the Persian envoy in April 1869, the Sheikh stated that he was hoisting the flag of the Lion and Sun over Bahrein. If, as seems probable from internal evidence, these letters date from the period of the abortive Persian Mission to Bahrein of 1860-61, it is relevant in assessing their importance that immediately after the reception of the Persian envoy, a Turkish envoy was received, the Persian flag hauled down and the Turkish flag substituted, and that in the early part of 1861 the flags of Persia and Turkey appear to have been flying side by side on the forts at Bahrein. There is nothing to show that either flag flew in Bahrein between the conclusion of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70) and 1868. (d) In September 1869 the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah attacked the islands, and with the assistance of Sheikh Md. bin Abdulla killed the ruling Sheikh Ali. The Persian flag may have been hoisted on this occasion. But there is no reference to this in the detailed reports of the capture of the islands by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah, or of the operations as the result of which those Sheikhs were reduced at the end of 1869. (Enclosure to Government of India's Despatch No. 7 of 25th January 1870 ; Resident's Despatches of 11th September, 25th September, and 5th October 1869.) (7) Letters from past Rulers o Suzerainty. It is by no means improbable that in 1799, 1816-17, and 1839 the rulers of Bahrein addressed letters to the Persian Government acknowledging Persian suzerainty over the island, and they appear certainly to have done so in 1860. But the only letters the text of which has ever been communicated to Her Majesty's Government are the two letters communicated by the Persian envoy in London in 1869. Those letters indeed categorically acknowledge Persian suzerainty over Bahrein, and state that it has been uninter ruptedly exercised in the past. But they appear to date from 1860, and the submission of Bahrein to Turkey and the hauling down of the Persian flag in the same year are, it is suggested, material in assessing the weight to be attached to them, (8) Declarations made hy Her Persian Minister in 1869. (a) These declarations are examined in paragraph 98 above. The text of the Note addressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Persian envoy on 29th April 1869, on which the subsequent Persian claims have to a considerable extent been based, is given in paragraph 85 above. The wording of that Note, and the general attitude adopted by Her Majesty's Government, as evidenced by their acquiescence in the despatch of a mission to Bahrein by Persia, undoubtedly afforded Persia justification for the inferences she appears to have drawn. But, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Note addressed to the Persian Minister on 18th February 1929 and reproduced in Appendix B, the JSipte in question, while very loosely expressed, was 2953 L42 never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Government (cp. m this connection para graphs 102 and 110 above), and in stating that due consideration had been given in the past by Her Majesty s Government to the Persian claim it did not m any way admit that that claim was valid. The Note, indeed con firmed the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the Sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. (h)The undertaking given by Her Majesty_s Government in the same correspondence to communicate in future with Persia before undertaking punitive action against the rulers of Bahrein is prima fac consistent with a recognition by Her Majesty's Government of Persian claims to that island. But it appears, however, in fact to have^ been no more than a courteous indication by His Majesty s Government of their desire to pay the fullest possible attention to any Persian claims. It will be observed that the first (and apparently the only) communication made to the Persian Government in discharge of this understanding, intimated to that Government the intention of Her Majesty's Government to proceed at once against the Chief now in possession of Bahrein ' consequent on his breach of the maritime peace and his attack on the Sheikh who had been placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government. (9) Closeness of Relations Persia The Sheikhs of Bahrein are strongly opposed to a ay recognition of Persian suzerainty (cp. paragraph 139). The Persian suggestion that relations are at the present time closer between Persia and Bahrein than between Bahrein and any other independent civilised State is without founda tion. Relations are at least equally close with Saudi Arabia, and the closest relations are maintained in addition with Great Britain and with British India. The Terms of the Treaties 1809, 1814 1857 between the British 148. In addition to the nine arguments examined above, Persia has on more than one occasion appealed to the provisions of her treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 with the British Government in connection with her claim to Bahrein. Her appeal is based substantially on the fact that those treaties provide in certain circumstances for the evacuation of Persian territory occupied by British troops. The relevant passages of the treaties are as follows;— Aifcch. XIII, (i) By the preliminary 1809 between His No. v, 53. Majesty's Government and Persia, the Persian Government undertook not to ' permit any European force whatever to pass through Persia either towards India or towards the ports of that country'; while His Majesty's Government undertook ' in case any European forces have invaded or shaU invade the territories of His Majesty the King of Persia ' to ' afford to His Majesty the King of Persia a force, or in lieu of it a subsidy, with warlike ammunition . . . and officers. ...' Article 5 of the same treaty provided : ' If a detachment of British troops has arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and, by the consent of His Persian Majesty, landed on the island of Karak or any of the Persian ports, they shall not in any manner possess themselves of such places, and from the date of these preliminary articles the said detachment shall43 lu V be at the disposal of His Majesty the King of Persia the amount of which shall be settled in the definitive treaty'' Article 6 provided that ' If the said troops remain bv the desire of His Majesty the King of Persia either at Karak or at any other port in the Gulf of Persia ' they shall be treated in a friendly manner by the Governor and arrange ments made for the supply to them of provisions, &amp;c. at fair prices. (ii) Treaty of 1814.—Article (2) provides that 'His Aitch XIII Britannic Majesty further engages not to interfere in any No.vii, 60. dispute which may hereafter arise between the Princes, noble men and great chiefs of Persia, and if one of the contending parties should even offer a Province of Persia with a view to obtaining assistance, the English Government shall not agree to such proposal, nor by adopting it possess themselves of such part of Persia.' Article 11 provided that ' Should His Persian Majesty Aitch. XIII, require assistance from the English Government in the No. xviii, 81. Persian Gulf, they shall, if convenient and practicable, assist him with ships of war and troops. The expenses of such expedition shall be accounted for and defrayed by the Persian Government, and the above ships shall anchor in such ports as shall be pointed out by the Persian Government and not at other harbours without permission, except from absolute necessity.' (iii) The Treaty of Peace of 4 th M 1857, drawn up on the conclusion of the war between Persia and Great Britain, provided that ' Peace being happily concluded between Their said Majesties, it is hereby agreed that the forces of H.M. the Queen shall evacuate Persian territory, subject to the conditions and stipulations hereafter specified ' (^rt. 2), and that 'immediately on the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty the British troops will desist from all acts of hostility against Persia, and the British Government engages further that as soon as the stipulations in regard to evacua tion by the Persian troops of the Herat and Afghan territories as well as in regard to the reception of the British Mission at Tehran shall have been carried into full effect, the British troops shall without delay be withdrawn from all ports, places and islands belonging to Persia. . . .' If Bahrein were Persian territory and if it had been occupied by British forces at the times envisaged by the treaty provisions to which appeal is made by Persia, there might be some force in the Persian argument, though even then His_ Majesty's Government might claim that the fact that their actual relations with Bahrein had in no way been affected by the provisions of those treaties, and that Persia had made no protest at the time against any failure to implement those provisions clearly showed that Persia had accepted in the past the fact that Bahrein fell outside her territorial limits. In fact, neither in 1809, 1814 nor in 1857 was there any British occupation of Bahrein ; while His Majesty's Government, never having admitted Persian sovereignty over Bahrein or regarded Bahrein as an integral part of Persia, have in the past adopted the attitude that the terms of the treaties referred to above are irrelevant for the present purpose. As stated by His Majesty's Government in 1906 in reply to a Persian Note which based the Persian claim upon the provisions of those treaties, ' the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty's Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty's44 Government Lave never admitted the ownership or sove reignty of Persia oyer Bahrein. Such a claim is in then- view entirely inadmissible. Review of the Persian Claim. 149. It is relevant in the first place that fiom 1847 to 1913 the Turkish claim to Bahrein was pressed with at least equal vigour to the Persian claim, and that through much of that period the Turkish claim had a stronger practical iustification than can be claimed by Persia smce a period lono- prior to 1783, in that Turkey was the suzerain of the adioining continental littoral of Arabia and held or preferred Claims to both sides of the Gulf by which Bahrein is enfolded. Moreover, Muscat, which in the early part of the 19th century on more than one occasion established a temporary control over Bahrein and diew tubute fiom it, was deterred from urging its claims by force from 1829 onwards only by the attitude of His Majesty's Government, while the Wahahi Amirs brought effective pressure to bear on Bahrein and drew tribute from it, though latterly probably in respect only of Bahreini possessions on the mainland, at frequent intervals through the early part of the 19th century, and desisted only with their subjugation by Turkey in 1870. Persia, in other words, was up to 1913 one only of the claimants to Bahrein, and through much of the period 1847 to 1913 if anything a less insistent and to some extent a less plausible claimant than Turkey. 150. These considerations, however, apart, the general effect of a review of the history of Bahrein over the last 150 years and of an examination of the specific arguments put forward by Persia and referred to in paragraphs 147-8 above 'is to suggest that there is no solid basis for a Persian claim to suzerainty or sovereignty over the islands. The geographical remoteness of the islands from Persia and the fact that their population is Arab are admittedly not decisive arguments. The real weakness in the Persian claim appears to be that there has been no effective exercise of Persian authority in the islands since the expulsion of Persia by the ancestors of the present ruling house in 1783. Such incidents as the momentary hoisting of the Persian flag in 1860, its flying side by side with the Turkish flag in 1860-61, or the temporary tender of allegiance to Persia in 1799, 1816-17 and 1839 must be considered in relation to the history of the islands as a whole, in the period now under consideration, and in particular to the consistent claim of Turkey between 1847 and 1913 and to the absence of any sequel to such momentary acknowledgment of or appeals to Persian power; and they cannot carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course of years. The remarks of the Government of India in 1870, quoted in paragraph 97 above, are relevant in this connection, as are the observa tions in paragraph 8 of the British Note to Persia of 18th February 1929. It may be added, too, that during the period from 1783 Bahrein has at various dates been in a position to enter into treaty engagements or discussions with neighbouring States such as Muscat (paragraph 26), Turkey (paragraph 103), the Egyptian Viceroy, Mehemet Ali (paragraph 34) and His Majesty's Government on a basis inconsistent with her being at the time subject to Persian jurisdiction. A further point of some importance is the absence, so far as available records show, of any reference to Persia by the Sheikhs of Bahrein, at any date since the conquest of Bahrein by the ancestors of the present rulers in 1783, on the occasion of45 their accession, or of any formal acknowledgment by Bahrein on such occasions of sovereignty or suzerainty such as might be expected from a Sheikh who regarded himself as a vassal of Persia, Nor does any protest at the absence of any such formal acknowledgment appear at any time to have been made by Persia. 151. The correspondence of 1869-70, to which particular attention has been paid by Persia in the past, and which may be thought the strongest contention that Persia is in a position to put forward, may indeed be quoted as evidence of the view taken by Her Majesty's Government at that period of the relation of Persia to Bahrein. But it cannot be valid as against the Sheikhs, and while it is sufficiently loosely expressed to afford some justification for the construction which has been placed on it by Persia, it is relevant that the construction placed on it by Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and supported by the Government of India, passed without challenge in 1871 (paragraph 102) • that a similar interpretation was placed on it, with a minimum of preliminary discussion, in 1886 (paragraph 110); that at frequent intervals between 1870 and 1880 His Majesty's Government maintained the independence of Bahrein against Turkey (paragraphs 99-107 above); that so early as January 1870 they drew the attention of the Turkish Government to the British Note of 1851 (para graph 61 above); and that His Majesty's Government have uninterruptedly maintained the independence of Bahrein against Persia and Turkey alike since the date of the correspondence in question. 152. The Sheikhs themselves appear, particularly in the early part of the past century, before their relations with Her Majesty's Government were placed on a more definite footing by the Agreements of 1880 and 1892, to have been guided by a consideration of their own immediate interests in deciding on the line of policy to be adopted towards the stronger rulers by whom they were surrounded. But not only is it now almost three-quarters of a century since any appeal, however flimsy, appears to have been made to Persia by Bahrein, but the present Sheikh (like his predecessor) is keenly apprehensive of any recognition of the Persian claim, to which he is most strongly opposed. C.—Attitude of British Government, 1820-1934. 153. From 1820 onwards His Majesty's Government consistently dealt with the Sheikhs as independent rulers. They concluded treaties with them on that basis in 1820, 1847, 1861, 1868, 1880 and 1892, and they have been prepared to maintain their independence by diplomatic, or on occasion by forcible methods against challenge from outside, whether from Persia, Turkey, Eg3 T pt or the Wahabis. They originally entered into relations with the Sheikhs and promised them a measure of protection (para graph 16) in the interests of securing the peace of the Persian Gulf. In the early stages of those relations they appear to have been solely concerned to achieve this object (in 1820 they even offered their mediation, which was, however, not accepted by Persia, to secure the payment of tribute to Persia by the Sheikhs), and they restricted their inter ference with the internal affairs of the Sheikhdom to the minimum required to secure the interests of British subjects. They were consistently reluctant to establish a protectorate over Bahrein in view of the probable local embarrassments in regulating the succession, &amp;c., in which this might 2953 M46 involve them, and in 1849 they formally declined a request In- the Sheikh that he and the islands should be taken under British protection. In 1861 (paragraph /0) they gave the Sheikhs more categorical guarantees of protection in return for more binding undertakings. Their corre spondence with the Persian Minister in London in 1869—*0 shows the Home Government, however, still ready at tnat date to adopt the attitude that if any other Power would discharge the objects which had led Great Britain to undertake certain responsibilities in relation to ^ Bahrein, she would gladly see them do so. uloser relations 'with the Sheikh and closer control over his freedom of action were established for the first time by the Exclusive Agree ment of 1880. Relations became closer still with the conclusion of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892. Since that date the position of Bahrein, though His Majesty's Government make no claim to sovereignty, though the Sheikhdom continues to be regarded as independent from the international standpoint, and though the Sheikhs enjoy a very large measure of internal autonomy, has tended increasingly to approximate to that of a State under British protection. J. G. L aithwaite. India Office, 14th July 1934.^69/91) ^ /t^ - ^9- ,0-^ ^ ' Eastern Department . / ' w —^ I h: ve now read through carefully the complete dossier of papers sent to the Officers with regard to Bahrein and tne Law officers f Opinion. Having read the whole case, I am not surprised that the Law Officers stated that there was no foundation whatever for a Persian claim to sovereignty over the Islands and I do not think there can be any possible doubt on the matter. I have recently been studying an arbitral award given by a former President of the Permanent Court of International Justice, Mr, Huber, between the United States and the Netherlands and relating to sovereignty over a certain Island in the China Seas. From two points of view this award is extremely useful in connexion with the Bahrein case, and I think it la as well to call attention to it in this connex-ion In case the matter has in the future to be argued further. In the Falaas Island case the Netherlands who won the case based their claim on the fact that they had in fact been exercising sovereignty over Palmas Island for &amp; number of years; the Arbitrator decided in the Setherlands 1 favour and iais whole award is based upon the recognition of the actual exercise of sovereignty as W creating prescriptive rights which override a previous title. Secondly the method in which the Setherlands In fact exercised sovereignty was by reason of treaties entered/entered into by the native ruler, wnich they regarded as establishing suzerainty. Under the Netherlands treaties the native ruler retained hi© independence with regard to the administration of all native affairs on the island but the Netherlands Government controlled his foreign relations and also exercised Jurisdiction over foreigners, The two cases have, therefore, considerahle analogies, -the Arbitrator digouases what is the actual poei«.1 on in International law which is created by such treaties ith native rulers. His answer shortly is that In these cases the essentials of sovereignty are made up by the addition of the functions possessed by the Netherlands to those still left to the native ruleri add the two together and you get all that is required to make complete sovereignty, and the Netherlands were entitled to include the functions left to their vassal as part of the necessary elements of their own sovereignty. This is what Mr. Huber says in his own words;- 'As regards contracts between a State and native princes or chiefs not recognised as members of the community of nations, these are not in the international law sense treaties or conventions capable of creating rights and obligations such as may, in international law, arise out of treaties. But on the other hand, contracts of this nature are not wholly void of indirect effects on situations governed by international law| if they do not constitute titles in international law, they are none the less facts of which that law must in certain c i r c tances/I \ 'V' circumstances take accoimt. From the timo of the discoveries until recent times colonial territory ha® very often been acquired, especially in the Best Indies, by maans of contracts with the native authorities, which contracts leava the easting organisations more or less intact as regards the native population, while granting to the Colonizing Power, besides economic advantages, also the exclusive direction of relations with other powers and the right to exercise public authority in regard to their own nationals and to foreigners. The form ©f t,he legal relations created by such contracts is most generally that of suzerainty and vassal or of the so-called colonial protectorate. In substance, it is not an agreement between equalsj it is rather a form of international organisation of a colonial territory, on the basis of autonomy for the natives. In order to regularize the situation as regards other .. tates, this organization r.quirea to be completed by the establishment of powers to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations imposed by international law on every Stat© with regard to its own territory, ted thus suzerainty over the native JEtate becomes the basis of territorial sovereignty as towards other members of the community of nations. It Is the sum total of functions thus allotted either to the native authorities or to those of the colonial power which decides the question whether at/fO at any gi^en period the conditions required for the ©itercise of sovereignty are fulfilled,« It seems to me that what Mr. Muber says applies to Bahrein. Ihe elements necessary for the conetltution of sovereignty In regard to Bahrein are at the present day made up of the addition of (a) M.M.G.» R right under tiie exclusive treaties in force elnce 1880, via. control oi loreign relatione and jurisdiction over foreigners, and (b) the government of the native affairs of the territory still left with the Sheik. Bahrein is a State maer mUl8ii protection and is really under the sovereignty cf H . m ,.. from tuo point of view of international law. xhe only c1 liois:;i which occurs to me of the very admirable way in ;hich our Ga.se has been presented in the past and of the arguments in the material laid before the Law Officers is that nucn too mucn stress has been laid upon the independence 1 ' of the Uieik of Bahrein, Up to 1©80 this was correct; after that it is not really legally correct to soate that the Uieik is Independent. ruler who has no control of his external relations is not fully inaependant under International law, We have rightly stressed the complete absence of effective Persian sovereignty during all the relevant periods, but I do not think we have made quite enough of the evidence of effective exercise of sovereignty by H,!- ,0., which la really equally striking} suoh 8S deposition of unsatisfactory Sheiks, the control ®x©rciged over them by political residents, and the fact tdftt it is H,M,G, who have resisted the claims not merely of Ptpsia but of lurkey and Muscat and the Wahabis. 'fhe second point Is that Persia has based her case 0r i the alleged doctrine that a State cannot lose sovereignty over/o?er part of its territory unless It cedes it bj a treaty or recognises the independence of a new ttate. .The rersian case denies the doctrine of prescription, Mr. Huber's award, as I have stated above. Is based upon the recognition of this doctrine, and he clearly states that effective display of sovereignty for a number of years in Independence of a Etate formerly possessing title creates a new title to sovereignty and causes the previous one to lapse. Here is a quotation of what ir. Huber says about prescription as a ground for the acquisition of a new sovej/eignty. it is extremely to the point. Practice, as well as doctrine, recognizee though under different legal formulae and with certain differences as to the conditions required - that the continuous and peaceful display of territorial sovereignty (peaceful In relation to other states) is as good as a title ,.. Territorial sovereignty, as has already been said, involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. this right has as c orollary a duty; the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other Stetes, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace.and in war, together with the rights which eacn State may claim for its nationals in foreign territory. ithout manifesting its territorial sovereignty in a manner corresponding to circumstances, the State cannot fulfil this duty. territorial sovereignty/sovereignty cannot limit itself to its negative side, i.e. to excluding the activities of other states; for it serves to divide between nations the apace upon which human activities are employed, in order to assure them at all points the minimum of protection of which international law is the guardian, 'Although municipal law, thanks to its Judicial system, is able to recogniae abstract rights or property as existing apart from any material display of them, it has none the less limited thair affect by the principles of pre.&gt;crlption and the protection of possession. International law, the structure of which is not based on any super-State organisation, cannot be presumed to reduce a right such as territorial sovereignty, with which almost all international relations are bound up, to the category of an abstract right, without concrete manifestations. 'The principle that continuous and peaceful display of the functions of State within a given region is a constituent element of territorial sovereignty Is not pnly based on the conditions of the formation of independent States and their boundaries (as shown by the experience of political history) as well as on an international jurisprudence and doctrine widely accepted; this principle has further been recognized in more than one fed ral £tate, where a jurisdiction is/Is established in order to apply, as need arises, rules of International law to the Interstate relations of the States members. This is the more significant, in that it might well be conceived that in a federal State possessing a complete judicial systeia for Interstate matters -» iar more than in the domain of international relations properly so-called - there should be applied to territorial questi ns the principle that, failing any specific provision of law to the contrary, &amp; J U8 ln I® onoe lawfully acquired shall prevail over de facto possession however well established. It may sufiice to cjuote among several non-dissimilar decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States of . merica that in the case of the K.tate of Indiana v» State of Kentucky (156 U,S» 479) 1890, where the precedent of the case of Rhode Island v. Maaeachusetts (4, Eow. 591, 659) is supported by quotations from VATTSu and WMEAfOM, who both admit prescription founded on length of time as a valid and incontestable title. (Signed) W,E. Beckett, August 15, 1934.131 iB ^ s similar grounds. It appears to Sir John Simon that it would undoubtedly be desirable, in order to avoid the deleterious effects of a period of uncertainty as to the reply of His Majesty's Government that the United Kingdom Delegation should be in a position to reply immediately on these lines, since if any answer was to be made, this could only be done during the course of the general discussion with which the Assembly opens. with this end in view he would propose to provide the Delegation with the necessary material for such a statement in advance and suggests that his Department should collaborate with the India Office on its preparation forthwith, 5, With regard to the second and third contingencies envisaged above, namely a definite appeal by Persia for the assistance of the League under either Article or Article 15 : of the Covenant, it has been suggested in the course of oast I interdepartmental discussions that further proceedings at Geneva might be arrested at the outset by the preliminary objection that, in view of the evident absurdity of the Persian claims, the matter is not one which could properly be raised under these or any other articles of the Covenant and the Council should, therefore, not proceed to consider the merits of the question. This course. Sir John Simon is advised, is not practicable for the following reasons. The general lines of the Persian thesis would doubtless be that Persia claimed 4 ! sovereignty over the islands in questionj that she wished to ©Etablish administrative control there; and that she was prevented from doing so by the attitude of His Majesty's Government, a claim such as this by one power for the ■ , il ' V?'' • ■ I restitution to it of territory, which it is prevented from administering/ • ■ Z • ... - . ■'/ •' 1 ^ .//atoinlBtering hp the action of another, is eminently one of thos© nfiiich 15^4y l)© pfoiMsriy submitted to th&lt;* Council imd©i* 4Ptiolee 11 op IS. it *ould te© tapo®®ible to contend t^t olaimr of this elafMi did not ooise within the eoop® of them *rtlcloe of the Covenant. it is true that Hie Wajetty's oovernment mintain thai, in this articular me the Persian olain it wltho?at legal foimdation; hnt, as th® Coianell clearly cannot accept the ex oarte seeerticsB to this ©'feet of one of the parties to the diepnte, the Coimcil would neoeeearily have to go into the iserit® of the Persian elaiB in ®rder to reject it on this ground.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th August relative to the possibility of the Persian Govern ment raising the question of Persia's claim to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa during the forthcoming sessions of the Council or the Assembly of the League of Nations. 2. If the Persian delegate should assert these claims in the course of this year's general discussion before the Assembly, Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare agrees that it would be sufficient for the United Kingdom delegation to make a short counter-statement. Such counter-statement should, in his opinion, be quite brief and summary, in order to avoid giving the Assembly any impression that His Majesty's Government regard Persia's claims as deserving of serious con sideration. So far as the Bahrein is concerned a reference to the published correspondence would probably be sufficient. If the Persian claims to Tamb and Abu Musa should also have been referred to, he suggests that it would suffice to state that while the history of these barren islands prior to 1750 is obscure, since that date authority over them, and such effective occupation as has existed, has had its origin in the Jowasimi Arabs of the Trucial Coast of Arabia, that their representative, the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah and the Sheikh of Shargah on that coast, who respectively exercise authority over these islands, are independent rulers in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, and that the Persian claim, which appears to have first been put forward so recently as 1887, has been repudiated by His Majesty's Government acting on their behalf. 3. If, however, Persia should seek to raise, her claims before the Council under either article 11 or article 15 of the Covenant, Sir Samuel Hoare has con siderable hesitation in accepting without qualification Sir John Simon's view that there is no argument which could be advanced as a valid objection to the Council's dealing with the merits of the case under either of these articles. He would have doubted whether either article is strictly relevant. Persia's claim to Bahrein, for example, is in effect a refusal to recognise the status of Bahrein as an independent State in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Govern ment. The most relevant words in article 11 are those which declare it to be the friendly right of each member of the League to bring to attention 'any circum stance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb • . . . the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends,' while article 15 relates to disputes 'likely to lead to a rupture.' Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that it would be desirable for the British representa tive to point out that the independence of Bahrein is not a circumstance which in any way endangers peace, and that it is not likely to lead to a rupture unless Persia proposes to attack Bahrein, which His Majesty's Government presume is not her intention. He suggests that it would be desirable to make this point in order, from the commencement, to set the matter in its proper light before members of the Council. But it might perhaps be wise to add that His Majesty's Government, while doubting whether the articles of the Covenant are in any way applicable, nevertheless have no desire to prevent the Council being seized of the question on that account, on the understanding that, whatever might be the result 0 f the proceedings. His Majesty's Government consider that they will not be precluded thereby from resisting aggression by Persia if the latter should be so 'H-advised as to embark upon such a course. 4. As regards the position which would arise, if, as may be anticipated, the Council suggested a reference to the Permanent Court of International Justice, Sir Samuel Hoare has the following observations to offer to [215 k—6] /2-A, 4 /%■0 Sir John Simon's view that it would be preferable to accept such a referen rather than allow the Council to arrive at its conclusion on the advice merely of its own committee of legal experts. He would be prepared to accem Sir John Simon's reasoning on this choice of alternatives if the case were one i which His Majesty's Government could afford to run the risk, however small of an adverse decision by the International Court. But in the present case it i necessary to envisage the consequences which would follow if the totally unexpected happened and the court gave a decision in Persia's favour. In that event Sir Samuel Hoare cannot see that His Majesty's Government would haye any alternative but to refuse to implement the decision, having regard alike to their strategic and other interests, their obligations of honour and justice to the sheikh, and finally their own reputation for faith and loyalty throughout the Middle East. He would therefore suggest that, before it is decided to a^ree to a reference of the Bahrein case to the Permanent Court, a preliminary decision is first required on the question whether, in the conceivable event of an adverse decision, His Majesty's Government are prepared to depart so far from their policy of co-operation with the League as to decline absolutely to implement a decision by the court. He would be glad to receive an expression of Sir John Simon's views on this point. 5. If, on the other hand, the Council dealt with the matter after reference to its own expert committee and made an adverse or inconclusive report, though the risk of this appears to be regarded as slightlv less remote than that of a wrong decision by the court. Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that the evil consequences would be far more tolerable. In the first place it seems probable that an adverse report by the Council would not be unanimous, but that at least some members other than the parties to the dispute would lend their support throughout to His Majesty's Government. In this event it does not appear that any grave con sequences would ensue, since under paragraph 7 of article 15 the effect of a non- unanimous report is merely that members of the League retain their freedom of action. ^ ven . ^ ^ le gravest and least probable hypothesis of an unanimous leport m Persia s favour, the only effect appears to be that under paragraph 6 or article 15 no member of the League would go to war with Persia in order to assist His Majesty's Government in resisting possible Persian aggression. But 1 f e F sia were so foolish as to resort to war, presumably there could be no question 0 tins country s own right to resist aggression, especially if the caveat suggested at the end of paragraph 3 above had been entered at the outset. There remains e lypothesis suggested in paragraph 9 of your letter that in an attempt to spare 1 ersian susceptibilities the Council might frame its report in such terms as would not finally dispose of Persia's claim. The result of this, however, would be the continuance of the status quo, and His Majesty's Government would not be in an appreciably worse position than that which obtains at the present. p ± j? y S C( ? I11 P ar ^ S011 ^ le possible results of an adverse decision by the our ox international Justice and of an adverse or inconclusive report by the uouncil, oir Samuel Hoare feels, haying regard to what is at stake upon each even hat it is preferable to run a slightly greater risk of the far lesser evil. a • ui 7 ers . la j* c l ail n is taken up by the Council, it would certainly seem desirabie to wait for Persia to develop her case before finally deciding on the exact line to be taken m reply. Sir Samuel Hoare considers, however, that, for e reasons suggested above, it would in anv event be preferable to decline a reference to the International Court, and he also suggests that, with a view partly to explaining to the members of the Council the reasons of His Majesty's Govern ment s attitude, it would be highly desirable that the British representative, at the commencement of his counter-statement before the Council, should give an adequate account of the actual status of Bahrein and of the reasons why His Majesty s Government is a party to the dispute. of JLiJ' ki ?, g t , hi ?j ast ? u gg esti on Sir Samuel Hoare has had the advantage f of the 15th August, 1934, enclosed with the tW Rnl ® from the Foreign Office of the 23rd August, which suggests tip nnfnt T ^ ^ T 1 • soverei g nt ,y of His Majesty's Government from intp?n«HnTini V i ieW Q- 1I l ternatl0I l al la w. Whatever may be the exact position m of^k m T ip t ;5amuel Hoare agrees that the international responsibility contn„7ni /TlTf u 4 ln res P ect of Bahrein is a practical and necessary of h^ p ^ p 6 fl I ^ that by treaty with the sheikh they are in exclusive control external relations. But it is also an important fact that Bahrein is not a11% . V British possession, and that the sheikh is an independent potentate in the sense that he exercises sovereignty in his internal affairs. It is necessary to bear this aspect of the case in mind as well as the international responsibility of His Majesty s Grovemment, and Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that it would be particularly desirable to lay great stress on these facts in any argument before a political body such as the Council of the League of Nations, some of whose members might otherwise be so ill-mformed as to suppose that His Maiesty's Government may have acquired, or may seek to acquire, by usurpation or other wise, jurisdiction over Bahrein as a British possession. 9 ' T ! le Secretary of State accordingly suggests that if the Council of the League take Persia s claim to Bahrein into consideration, the statement of the British case should give prominence to the following points (a)That Bahrein is not a British possession but an independent State in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, and that the latter make no sort of claim to internal sovereignty; (&amp;) That although His Majesty s Government is a party to the dispute with Pei sia because the sheikh has entrusted the control of his external relations to them and Bahrein herself is not a member of the League, nevei theless, in a matter of such importance as a claim by a foreign Power to bring Bahrein into subjection. His Majesty's Government naturally could not take any action contrary to the wishes of her ruler; that His Majesty's Government are in honour bound to protect Ins independence; that he repudiates the Persian claim; that though both he and His Majesty's Government are convinced that the Persian case is entirely frivolous, he naturally objects to the submission of a dispute involving the very existence of the Bahrein State to arbitra tion or settlement by an outside authority, and that if His Majesty's Government were so to submit it against his wishes, such action would be a clear abuse of their position as his trustee. 10. Sir Samuel Hoare hopes that Sir John Simon may be able to agree to the suggestions made in this letter. If, however, the matter has to be further considered, it is clear that it will not be practicable to give final instructions to the British representatives at the forthcoming meetings of the Council of the League, as the questions at issue will need the careful consideration of the Cabinet. It is observed that Tehran telegram No. 114, of the 25th August, indicates no special reason for supposing that the Persian Government intend to bring up their claims at those meetings. If, however, they should place them on the agenda before a decision has been reached as to the line to be adopted by Majesty's Government, Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that the British repre sentative on the Council should be instructed to secure a postponement, as any such claim is obviously a matter of which due notice should be given and which possesses no degree of urgency.

LTranslation of an article in 'Amersfoortsch Dagblad' (Holland) ENGLAND AND PERSIA AGREE. THE DIFFERENCES IN REGARD TO THP BAHRAIN ISLANDS SETTLED. ' In a very quiet manner the British statesmen have been able to clear up the difference which might easily - (if sharpened by clumsiness) - nave badly harmed the British Interests at an important point in the British Empire. Ihe Persian minister for -foreign Affairs, Kazemi, before returning to Tehran after the meetings of the League of Nations at Geneva, went to London, it is mostly the American Press which gives information about Kezemi's stay in London. The discussions concerned the Bahrain Islands on the South- Arabian coast of the Persian Coast, under British protectorate, lo this latter fact the Persians have continuously protestedi according to them they have older rights on the Islands than the British. r This difference was of no great importance so long as the economical importance of the islands was chiefly determined by the pearl-fishing, but fate decided that oil wells were discovered on the islands last year; thereafter the question of wonership had an entirely different aspect. The Sultan of Bahrain, after having been so instructed by the by the British Government, charged the Standard Oil Company of California with the exploitation of the oil wells, this oil Company being in business relationship with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The Shah of Persia complained about these matters the British and American Governments and the League of Nations, ■mese protests had no results, however. But Persia had more e ffective weapons. All of a sudden the workmen of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company threatened to strike, the result of which would have been that ® snips of the British Fleet would not be supplied with sufficient oil.15^ As a result of the threatening strike. Great B ritatn was xn a especially disagreeable position and did everything to prevent the disaster. In any event, it was considered in^the British capital to be far from advisable to start a new dispute - after tne conflict with Persia about the Anglo -Persian On jj) Company nad been settled amicably a year ago. Conflicts were especially feared because the Persian u overnment had come to very friendly and close relations with Turkey, and while it was also following a political course which England did not like to promote, namely by trying to get into close contact with the Soviet Union. For this reason Sir John Simon, ^ritish minister of Foreign Affairs, invited his Persian colleague to come to London after the sessions of the Asembly at Geneva, in order to discuss the question of the Bahrain Islands. The result of these discussions is a compromise of an espeiaii-y especially English character: Persia is assigned sovereignty over the waters of the Persian Guli - and probably the fishing rights - whereas for the Islands a joint British Persian Government management is instituted, guaranteeing the Persian Government its due share in the produce of the oil wells. As a matter of counter-achievement the Persian Government undertakes to put a stop to the anti-British propaganda and to see to the well-being of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's employees. Ihere even is a chance of the Si^ah of Persia putting seal upon the agreement by visiting London next year.B y Air Mail.

[E 5669/139/34] Foreign Office (Secret and Important.) . Sir, _ y r ' ' I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform yon that he has considered your letter of the ^th September, setting forth the views of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare upon the attitude which His Majesty's Government should adopt m the event of the Persian claims to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa being referred to the League of Nations. &amp; 2- Although this question has now become less urgent, through the failure of the Persian Government to raise the question of these claims during the recent sessions of the Council and Assembly of the League, it would, nevertheless, be imprudent to assume that they will not do so in some form or other in the future and even m the near future. In that event it would be clearly undesirable that His Majesty s Government should not be in a position to issue instructions at short notice to their representatives at Geneva/ and it is with the obiect of expeditmg a decision upon the form which these instructions should take that Sir John Simon desires me to explain his reasons for hesitating to endorse certain of the suggestions contained in your letter. The eventuality discussed in paragraph 2 of that letter, i.e., a passing reference to the claim'by the Persian delegate m a general discussion before the Assembly, presents no difficulty. It is the reply ot His Majesty's Government to a direct appeal to the League which needs to be determined. -f ill - 3. Sir John Simon lias carefully considered the points put forward in paragraph 3 of your letter, but he remains convinced that in the event of the Persian Government bringing the matter before the Council under either article 11 or article 15 of the Covenant, it would not be possible to prevent the Council from into the merits of the case. So far as concerns action under article 15. wlnie feir John Simon agrees that it might be possible to argue that the dispute was not m practice likely to lead to a rupture, he fears that this line of argument would not be open to the representative of the United Kingdom. When the Council was dealing with the Sino-Japanese dispute in March 1932, it was stated / 7 ™ the re P rese ntative of France Journal, March 1932, p. 340) thatv .7 ^ jj 'It is not for the Council, when a request has been submitted to it under article 15 of the Covenant, to decide whether this request is justified. In accordance with article 15 it is sufficient for one of the parties—if a member ot the League—-to notify the Secretary-General of a dispute, for the latter 0 e compelled to make all necessary arrangements for a full investigation and consideration thereof.' This statement was based upon an opinion given by a committee of jurists in nexion with the Corfu incident, which was subsequently endorsed by the ouncii; it is possible that the president's statement went somewhat beyond the J nsts opinion, but it nevertheless constitutes a precedent which, in Sir John U- ^ ® opinion, would almost certainly be followed by the Council in analogous cumstaiices, so that, in the event of the Persian Government bringing the d qUeS ? OI | before the Council UIlder art icle 15, the Council would feel itself of tv embark at once upon the procedure of investigation and consideration ferri(i 6 qnestion prescribed by that article. Moreover, the Council would certainly Oil rt er Majesty's Government recently brought the Anglo-Persian view C ^ Se ' :)e ^ ore that body under article 15, and in so doing relied on the the o- j ® rsia was not entitled to dispute the jurisdiction of the Council on ground that the matter was not really a serious one. Hattp v/? t ^ e eveilt ' however, of the Persian Government electing to bring the desmK ^ 0r j- the Council under article 11 it would be unnecessary for them to th e dispute as one which is ' likely to lead to a rupture,' since it would [265 f—1] Also received under India No,P.Z,6874/34, dated the Office Printed Letter 30.11.34.7/ ■ ' 2 Coui be se by t assui Sir. contf para of H the ( Cove any the ( these comp consi that I Coun opini suffice to show that there existed 'any circumstance whatever affecting inter, national relations which threatens to disturb international peace and the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.' Sir John Simon -cannot doubt that the Council would consider the matter one which it could properly deal with under article 11. Not only has the Persian claim and its rejection by His Majesty's Government been brought to the notice of members of the League on several occasions by documents which have been communicated to them, but it is material to bear in mind that in view of the recent Persian action at Tamb and Abu Musa, His Majesty's Government have found it necessary to issue instructions to their naval authorities in the Persian Gulf which contem plate in the last resort the defence of the rights of the sheikh by force, and have informed the Persian Government verbally that they have done so. The position is somewhat similar in regard to Bahrein, where His Majesty's Government are under treaty obligations to protect the sheikh against aggression by sea. There is, therefore, always the possibility of ill-advised Persian action resulting in an incident which, even if it were not sufficiently grave, to place His Majesty's Government and the Persian Government under an obligation to submit it to the Council under article 15 as being likely to lead to a rupture, would certainly be held to justify a reference to the Council under article 11. But even supposing that no such incident takes place, if the Persian Government were to bring the existing situation before the Council under article 11 and to refer, in justification of their action, to the communication which Sir Reginald Hoare has made to them of vi in accordance with the instructions contained in Foreign Office telegrams Nos. 92^ (jiffei and 93 of the 26th September (since, although that communication applied only j comn to the specific cases of Tamb and Abu Musa, the Persian Government could j C ourt reasonably assume that it could be regarded a fortiori as indicating the attitude f e els of His Majesty's Government towards possible Persian action at Bahrein), Sir 1 John Simon considers as certain that the Council would feel it incumbent upon them to deal with the matter, and he finds it difficult to see how any suggestion to the contrary could seriously be put forward by the representative of the United Kingdom. 5. For the above reasons Sir John Simon is convinced that it would be impossible in practice to prevent te Council from investigating the dispute and | that any attempt on behalf of His Majesty's Government to prevent them from doing so would not only fail, but would be extremely likely to antagonise the ,i s } an( Council. As regards the suggestion made in the last sentence of paragraph 3 of your letter, Sir John Simon fears that unless it were expressly stated to refer L ac j only to the period during which the dispute was before the Council, the suggested §j r j statement would be read as an intimation that whatever the result of the [f ^ proceedings before that body, His Majesty's Government intended to maintain the present position, if necessary, by force; and, if so, it is difficult to imagine an action which would be better calculated to prejudice the position of His Majesty's Government in the eyes of public opinion, and to dispose the Council to look with favour on the Persian contentions. 6. Sir John Simon does not mean to suggest that it would not be desirable for the United Kingdom representative to take the earliest possible opportunity of impressing upon the Council the essential weakness of the Persian claim ana the strength of the historical and legal arguments which can be adduced against ^ it. It might even be possible to invite the Council to say that, having heard botn ^ a j e sides, they had found the Persian claim to be supported by no valid evidence or I (( coir arguments, and to reject it without further enquiry. But Sir John Simon tears that any such attempt would be most unlikely to succeed. As soon as the coj^ ^ tentions of the two parties had been laid before the Council, it would become !o apparent that the main, if not the only, issue, in the case was a pure questioi m 0Yei of law, i.e., whether the Persian claim to sovereignty over the islands iri -0 ^ to th if on argu] comn that the C undei repor true 1 memt no ob Persi entitl was' well-founded or not, and it may be regarded as certain that Council woi . not be prepared to decide the matter without first having the legal issue examin eveil • .and reported on by some competent body. ,i e be in 7. In these circumstances there would be three possible courses open to have i Council. It might (on the assumption that neither party is entitled to taKe plajes case to the Permanent Court under the optional clause) endeavour to mauce _ hrticl, parties to consent to a reference to the court by special agreement; or it nig jopini ( ask the court for an advisory opinion; or it might seek the advice of a comni of jurists appointed ad hoc. r ea gr^ f course were adopted and agreed to the proceedings before the | Council would presumably terminate, and the question of the Persian claim would be settled by the decision of the Permanent Court. In view of the opinion given , by the Law Officers as regards the Persian claim to Bahrein, and on the assumption that the Persian claim to Tamb and Abu Musa is no stronger, gir John Simon cannot believe that the court would not decide in favour of the contention of His Majesty s Government. But in view of the suggestion in i) paragraph 4 of your letter, that it may be necessary to consider the possibility of His Majesty* Government declining absolutely to implement a decision by the court. Sir John Simon would point out that under article 13 (4) of the Covenant, His Majesty s Government are bound to ' carry out in full good faith any award or decision that may be rendered,' and that, under the same paragraph, in the event of any failure to carry out such an award or decision, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.' In these circumstances, a proposal to violate this obligation, involving, as it would, a complete departure from the policy which His Majesty's Government have consistently pursued in relation to the League, and possibly their withdrawal from that body, is a matter which could only be considered by the Cabinet. 9. If either of the other two courses indicated above were adopted, the Council would still have to deal with the matter after it had received the advisory opinion of the court or the report of the Committee of Jurists. From the point of view put forward in paragraphs 5 and 6. of your letter, there is therefore difference between these two courses oF~action, except that a report by an ad committee of jurists would carry less weight than an advisory opinion by the court. From the point of view of the possibilities of success, Sir John Simon feels no doubt that, in the interests of His Majesty's Government, a reference to the Permanent Court for an advisory opinion would be the preferable course, if only for the reason that the opinion of the court could be given after full argument in public, which would not be the case in the event of a reference to a committee of jurists. / / 10. At the same time. Sir John Simon dops not feel able to agree altogether with the contentions advanced in paragraph 5 of your letter. The opinion given, whether it emanated from the Permanent Court or from a committee of jurists, must be either in favour of or against the Persian claim to sovereignty over the islands; it would in effect be a decision on the legal question involved, and it is most unlikely that the Council would be disposed to take any other course than to adopt it. If the opinion were in favour of the Persion contention (which Sir John Simon can only regard as in the highest degree unlikely, at any rate if the opinion emanated from the Permanent Court), it does not seem probable that His Majesty's Government would receive support from other members of the Council in a refusal to accept it. It is true that if the Council were acting under article 11, the unanimity rule would prevent the Council from adopting a report which His Majesty's Government were not prepared to accept. It is also true that in the case of a report under article 15, which was accepted by all the members of the Council other than His Majesty's Government, there would be no obligation on the other members of the League to go to war in order to assist Persia to recover Bahrein. But if the effect of the report were that Persia was entitled to the islands in question, there would be a direct obligation on His Majesty's Government under article 15 (6) not to go to war with Persia if she complied with the recommendations of the report.' If, therefore, Persia were thereafter to endeavour to take physical possession of any of the islands, it would not (though this might depend to some extent on the terms of the report) be safe Jo assume that this would be regarded as an aggression which His Majesty's Government were entitled to resist by force, or that, in the event of hostilities ensuing, it would be Persia who would be regarded as having violated her ^ligations under the Pact of Paris or under article 15 (6) of the Covenant. But even if the possibility of hostilities can be ruled out, the resulting situation would be m the highest degree unsatisfactory. The position would be that there would Ijave been a legal finding in favour of the' Persian contention, with which His Majesty's Government had refused to comply. While the provisions of Article 13 (4) of the Covenant would not strictly be applicable (since an advisory opinion is not an award or decision), the attitude of His Majesty's Government puld be wholly contrary to the policy which they have followed in regard to the - Le ague since its inception, and would seriously prejudice their position as a4 member of the Council in future when that body is endeavouring to compose disputes with which His Majesty's Government are not concerned. Moreover in view of the legal finding in favour of the Persian contention, the Persian Government would be entitled to act in all matters as though Bahrein belonged to them (which in some cases they do illegally, or at any rate extra-legally, to-day) and would be justified in international opinion in using any of the means whicli the extent of British interests and commitments might give them in order to establish their position. The resulting situation would be far worse than that which exists at present, and would seem likely to produce most undesirable results on British prestige in the Middle East. 11. But, in any case, Sir John Simon does not consider that it would be possible in practice to prevent the legal question being dealt with by either the Permanent Court or a committee of jurists, and he remains definitely of opinion f that in the event of an appeal by Persia to the Council, the wisest, and, indeed, the only possible course for His Majesty's Government, is to face the situation ' boldly, not to raise any objection to the Council's dealing with the matter, and i to state their willingness that the legal question should be referred to He I Permanent Court. It may be preferable that this should be done by means of a request by the Council for an advisory opinion rather than by a reference by special agreement between the parties, but this is not a point on which a decision need be taken at present. Sir John Simon ventures to think that once the Persian claim has received the publicity involved in its being brought before the Council, the object of His Majesty's Government should be to ensure either that it is disposed of once for ail, or that the responsibility for this not being done should rest entirely with the Persian Government. If the Persian Government agree to a reference to the Permanent Court, the opinion of the Law Officers gives every reason for believing that the result will be to put an end to the Persian claim once and for all. If, on the other hand, the Persian Government refused a reference to the court which His Majesty's Government had accepted, Persia would have i placed herself in the wrong, and it might fairly be assumed that the Council | would decline to deal further with the case. In these circumstances, the value j to Persia of her claim would disappear, and His Majesty's Government would be in a far stronger position for dealing with Persian attempts at encroachment in the future. On the other hand, any reluctance shown by His Majesty's Govern- ment to a judicial examination of the case could scarcely fail to suggest that the Persian claim was not entirely devoid of merits, while a definite refusal would greatly increase the value of the claim to Persia, whether as an asset in treaty negotiations, or as a means of pursuing a policy of pin-pricks. 12. On the question of the international position of Bahrein, Sir John Simon agrees that, on the assumption that no change in the status of the island is contemplated, it may be well to make it plain that His Majesty's Government have not acquired, and do not seek to acquire, by usurpation or otherwise, jurisdiction over Bahrein as a British possession. But, in his opinion, the fact s of the sheikh having entrusted his foreign relations to His Majesty's Government is one of procedure only and not of substantive right. The sheikh does not thereby acquire any greater right to independence from Persia than he had before. It merely means that a claim by Persia or any other State must be referred to, and settled with. His Majesty's Government instead of with the sheikh himself. Equally, in taking over the foreign relations of Bahrein, His Majesty's Govern ment have not acquired, and cannot acquire, any better right or title in the matter of the Persian claim than is possessed by the sheikh himself. The position is that, as His Majesty's Government have the conduct of Bahrein's foreign j relations, they have the full international responsibility therefor, and they cannot | plead the internal relationship between the sheikh and themselves as justifying | any failure to comply with the international obligations relating to the territory. &lt; In other words, it is not possible for His Majesty's Government, on the one nana, to' prevent foreign States from dealing with the sheikh direct, and, on the other, to contend that His Majesty's Government are not in a position to make tne sheikh give effect to his international obligations, 13. In view of the desirability of reaching an early decision on the importan | questions of policy involved, which may at any moment become urgent, I am o request that this letter may receive Sir Samuel Hoare's consideration as soon as possible.

'!■ Please refer to Foreign Office letter Mo,E 6669/ ^0 139/34, dated the 6th November 1934 - India Office P.2.6874/ 34 of 30th November 1934, on the subject of arbitration with the Persian Government over Bahrain. 2# It is naturally with considerable diffidence that I express an opinion contrary to that of the Foreign Office, especially on legal points, bat my views tor what they are worth are as followsj (i) His Majesty^ Government are not primarily a party to the suit. The question at issue is not whether His Majesty's Government or Persia, but whether the Shaikh of Bahrain or Persia, have a rightful claim to Bahrain. (ii) In paragraph 12 of the Foreign Office letter referred to above it seems to be assumed that because the Shaikh has entrusted his foreign relations to His Msyesty^s Government this ipgo fa cto commits him to all international obligations entered into by His Majesty's Government * in this case the latter's obligations to the League. But surely this assumption goes much too far. In the same paragraph the following sentence occurs j '...the fact of the Shaikh having entrusted his « foreign relations to His Majesty's Government » is one of procedure only and not of substantive f*right.' Presumably no 'matter of procedure only' Hon'ble Kr .H.A .F .Metcalfe ,G.S .1. ,C .1 .B. ,M. ? Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi.14 / -2- j^Cj \ only' can bind the ShaiJdi to obligations incurred by His Majesty^ Government without his consentf or even his know- ledge *. It appears to me that such obligations could only be binding on the Shaikh if His Majesty's Government exercised sovereignty over Bahrain, This is, however, far from being the case, Bahrain being 'an independent Arab State, under the protection of His Msgesty's Government, but not a British Protectorate' (P.GU13 page 61 paragraph 2)* (iii) In this connection it may be emphasised that His Majesty's Government's policy nowadays is to stress the international independence of the Arab Shaikhs as much as , possible (vide for instance the Air Agreement) since it is only by so doing that we can, outside matters definitely provided for in our treaties, continue to preserve our influence on the Arab coast by working through the Arab Rulers• (iv) If therefore the argument In paragraph (ii) is correct, then His Majesty's Government cannot appear before any arbitral body en behalf of the Shaikh until they have obtained from him his sanction, or'Power o Attorney* ,to do so. In order to obtain this Power of Attorney the Shaikh we would have to approach and whatever language we used our request would come to this: 'His Majesty's Government wish to arbitrate with the Persian Government as to whether Bahrain belongs to you or Persia. Please give us authority to arbitrate on this question on your behalf. mat is the Shaikh's reply likely to be (v) If the Shaikh were actually approached, and his reply were in the negative,then His Majesty's Government would presumably inform the League of the Shaikh's refusal to sanction arbitration, and take the opportunitypointing out tiiat this refusal was reasonable enough sincet (a) Tile Shaikii is an independent sovereign. (b) H« is not a Member of the League. ('c) And even ix* he were, the question at issue, his sovereign independence, is not one vanich can be brought before the League. (vi) On this reply being conveyed to tnem by the League I do net know what the Persian Ooveniment would do next. Probably nothing. Should they commit acts of aggression against the Shaikh we could remind them that: (1) We are the ally of the Shaikh and bound by treaty to defend him. (2) The Persian Government themselves are Signatories of the Kellog Pact. 3. Apart from the above arguments it appears to me that by their own acts of the last few years which have emphasised the independence of the Shaikh, Eis Majesty's Government have made it difficult for themselves to agree to arbitration. Such acts have been: (1) The granting of fiscal autonomy to the Shaikh f) (vide Foreign and Political Department telegram ^ No.2706 of 4th December 1932 repeated to Secretary of State for India). (2) The recognition not only by the Government ox India but by His iJajesty's Government § ox the accession oi the present Shaikh (vide Foreign and Political Department telegram Mo.2819 of 12th December x932 repeated to Secretary of State for India). (3) The granting to the Bahrain Government of the right to issue their own surcharged stamps (vide Foreign arid / I5. / iV) and Political Department telegram So.1876 repeated to Tehran - NG .36-T, and Secretary of State for India dated the 1st x^agast 1933). The categorical statement made to the International Bureau o± tiie Universal Postal Union, Berne, by the Indian Postal Autnorities on behalf His Majesty's Government, that the Bahrain Islands are not Persian territory - vide enclosure to Vcreign and Political Department endorsement dated the 28th March ±933, 4. To turn from the legal to the political aspect the question. 1 have no hesitation in saying that the local effect in the Gulf of arbitration over Bahrain, what ever the result of that arbitration, would be harmful in the extreme• The ,%rab Shaikhs, though they have progressed considerably in the last ten years, are far from appreciating are the nicities of international law, still less/their subjects. The mere fact th t we agreed to arbitration would be taken by the whole of the Arab Coast that we were tooweak to look after our clients' interests, and had been driven into arbitration by combined pressure from Persia and the League. No Shaikh would feel secure that at some time or other this new mysterious 'arDitaation' might not be employed against him. It is not impossible, tnat both ♦ Iraq and Ibn Saud might be encouraged by arbitration over Bahrain to demand similar action in regard to claims they might trump up respectively in regard to Kuwait terri tory and the Trucial Coast. (4) - r b v-6- 5. It must not be forgotten,too, that apart from ttie harmful effect that arbitration in itself would have on Arab public opinion in the Gulf, the actual methods adopted by the arbitrators might well tend to exacerbate that opinion. It would not be unreasonable I suppose for the arbitral authority to ask for an investigation 'on the spot', and if this took place we would then have an intern tional Commission sitting in Bahrain and investigating, not some rectification of a frontier, or problem of fishing rights (i.e», the type of question which such a Commission might usefully examine), but whether Bahrain did or did not belong to the Shaikh I I can imagine few Situations more humiliating to the Shaikh himself, more galling to Arab opinion not only locally but all over the Arab world, or more disastrous to British prestige in the Gulf.

Could you please refer to my demi-official letter r;o• 1^01—S, dated tiie 26tii December -1934, on the subject of arbitration with the Persian Government over Bahrain* 2. At the end of the last paragraph of that letter I drew attention to the unfortunate effect which an Internation al Commission, sitting at Bahrain, and investigating on the spot whether Bahrain did or did not belong to the Shai ch, would have not only on the .-.rabs of the Gulf, but throughout the Arab world. In this connection an article which appear ed in what is probably the leading Arab newspaper, the Muqattam of Cairo, is of some significance as indicating the interest which is taken in Gulf affairs by the Arabs outside ( 1 1 I 3. The article in question, which appeared in No #13971 of the Muqattam for December 17th, was entitled 'The Issues of the Shatt al ^rab and Bahrain before the League of Nations. What is demanded by Iraq, and what is demanded by rersia'. The article enumerated the questions at issue as rollows: 1. The refusal of Persia to organize her political relations with Iraq. 2. The desire of Persia to occupy a portion of the Iraqi Shatt al .rab and the interference on the part of her officials there with the Iraqi officials from time to time. Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. C.S.I.,C.I..u. f M.V.G.,■2 3. The desire of Persia to take possession of the Islands of Bahrain. 4. The desire of rersia to extend her influence over the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf. ' From the above it will appeal* that the Persians wish to link up the two questions (i.e. Iraq and Bahrain) and make them the subject of a bargain, so that they may extract something from Iraq or from iingland or from Bahrain. It is hardly necessary for us to say that the Iraqis will certainly not give in to the Persians, any more than will the people of Bahrain. 11 I am sending copies of this letter to Laithwaite and Knatchbull-Kugessen. 4.

Sir Samuel Hoare notes that the matter is no?/ regarded as less urgent, since the Persian Government have shown no desire to bring these claims before the Council of League for decision. He doubts whether any good purpose would be served at this stage by discussing in any great detail the instructions which should be given to the British representative if the Persian Government should take such a step at some future time. . Much ?70uld evidently depend on the circumstances in which the hypothetical case arose, and the general political situation at the time. If Persia committed an act of aggression and then complained of the measures taken to resist it, there would be a clear issue on a concrete case. If, on the other hand, Persia sought to bring her claims in the abstract before the Council, Sir Samuel Hoare has not suggested that, even in this event, it would be possible or desirable to prevent the Council being: seized of the question, but he considers that it would be important at an early stage of the proceedings to explain the independent status of Bahrain, or the Arab State concerned, and to point out that there is no reason why its ind epe ndence of Persia should lead to a rupture or endanger peace unless Persia committed an act of aggression. . 3 -/ ■ ae Under Secretary of State, Pore Ism Office./ 3# il8 regards the nature of the proceedings be fore the Council^ Sii osjiiuel nOdre notes tne thr^ee possible courses, desci ioed in pbi cigx^siph ? oil your letter# For the reasons inciiccit--jcl iii pcu a^rapii 4 01 'fciis India Offics Is't'tsr' of Sl/ii jjO\ouiDfc/i ji.^6 considers tiiEi't iti would 'be impossiDle xop His Majesuj 1 s Governjient to agree to the first course, namely, a special agreement between the parties to submit the case to tlie jurisdiction oi tne International Court. Ke is aware that His Majesty's Government are bound to carry out decisions in cases voluntarily submitted to the Court. But they are also precluded by long standing engagements to the Sheikh ox Bahrein, and by their own interests and regard for theii reputation j.or good faith, from carrying out a decision that Bahrein should be surrendered to Persia. It seems clear, therefore, that His Majesty's Government ought to avoid talcing any risk, (however negligible it may appear) of placing themselves in a position in which they would be faced by an insoluble conflict of obligations. For this reason he suggests that the first alternative must in any event be ruled out. In either of the other alternatives the Council would still have to arrive at its own conclusion after either asking the Court for an advisory opinion or seeking/the advice of a committee of jurists. It seems highly improbable that the Council, which would naturally take account of political as well as other considerations, would arrive at a unanimous conclusion in favour of Persia. Even in this most unlikely ovent, however, it appears that the consequences under the relevant articles of the Covenant would be far less serious 'than that of an actual judicial, and undoubtedly binding, decision by the International Court in favour of Persia on a case voluntarily submitted, to its jurisdiction.
