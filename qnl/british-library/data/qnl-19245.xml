Enclosed with Kemball’s letter is the translation of a letter (folio 4) from Shaikh Sultan bin Suggar [Sultan bin Saqr], the Joasmee [Qāsimī] ruler, to Kemball, dated 31 December 1854. In his letter Shaikh Sultan states that he will not permit any of his subjects to travel to the African coast this season, in order to prevent the traffic of slaves. However he warns that his subjects may go to the Batinah Coast if the inhabitants of that place are not subjected to the same restrictions. In his letter Kemball doubts the legitimacy of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr’s promises, but has made it clear to the shaikh that he does not seek to place restrictions on legitimate trade.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
