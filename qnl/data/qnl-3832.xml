An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 10-253; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled.A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file consists of correspondence connected to trust funds established for the Director of Customs (Claud Cranbrook Lewis de Grenier) and the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave). The majority of the papers are receipts, covering letters, and letters of acknowledgement relating to payments made into the trust fund account by the Government of Bahrain. This correspondence is between the Political Agency in Bahrain, the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Charles Belgrave, and the Eastern Bank in London, where the trust fund account was held. By the end of the file a proposal is made to transfer responsibility for the accounts to the Government of Bahrain.Inserted near the back of the file (folios 234-245) are letters (in Farsi and Gujarati, respectively) from merchants Abduljalil and Abdullatiff, and Bhagwandas Askarandas. The letters concern the trade of commodities such as textiles and dates. The papers are not connected to the rest of the file and were probably inserted by mistake.Folios 254-264 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Charles Dalrymple Belgrave</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Trust funds</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00037f#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00037f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00037f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
