From—J. G. Lorimer, Esq., C I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad, To—J. B. Wood, Esq., C.I.E,, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour, in continuation of my letter* No. 764 of 28th August 1912, to address you again, perhaps for the last time, on the subject of the («) The total amount is Es. 1 , 22,003 =£ t. Oudh Bequest. The importance (a) of 8,967 (approximately) a year. .. &gt;.• the Bequest, especially as it is now admi nistered under closer supervision from this Residency, seems to warrant and even to necessitate an annual report on it by the Resident. The Government Tv „ . of India and His Majesty’s Government (b) See in particular the following passages:— , -i-ii •&lt;&gt; ii 1912 , November, IV, 1, and December, IV, 6. have already been informed however, 1913 , April, iv, 2 ,-May, iv, 2 ; June, iv, 9 and through (6) the Baghdad Summary, of 10; August, IV, 5; September, IV, 8; and October, \ 7 ,5 ... ji -r* J i. iv, 4 and 6. many facts connected with the Bequest. 2. The political difficulties which overhung the working of the Oudh Bequest in 1912 passed harmlessly away; and, though the Committee of Union and Progress ultimately returned to power at Constantinople, official inter ference with our proceedings was not renewed. There is no guarantee, of course, that political difficulties will not recur in the future. So far the only lasting result of last year’s conflict with the Wilayat has been the exclusion of Turkish subjects from a share iu the management and benefits of the Bequest. 'The difficulties about the treatment of Turkish subjects raised by Ahmad Jamal Bey when he was Wall were not removed by his immediate successors. I specially invited two of them to signify that the difficulties had ceased to exist, but they professed in reply to be waiting for orders from Constantinople, which never came. I therefore accepted the situa tion as it stood, substituted a Persian subject permanently for the only Turkish subject who was a Mujtahid-Distributor under the Bequest, and stereotyped an arrangement that I had intended to be temporary whereby only British-Indian, Persian and other non-Ottoman subjects were included in charitable distribu tions under the Bequest. The Arabs of Karbala and Najaf are nearly all Ottoman subjects, and the exclusion of their poor from the benefits of the Ondh Bequest through the action of Turkish officials has made an unfavourable impression on their minds, but that is the Porte’s affair, not ours. 3. In the end the Mujtahid-Distributors whose attitude towards the new arrangements was still doubtful when I last («) wrote, and who were practically under suspension then, all took a satis factory line and had their shares restored to them without any deduction or reduction. A number of vacancies among Mujtabid-Ditributors and Residency Members of the Karbala and Najaf Com mittees, due to death and other causes, were filled up under my orders at the last distribution in October 1913, and the following is now the composition of the two Committees :— Karlala Committee.

The work done under the Bequest since my last report may be sum marised thus (а) Three distributions were held in which a total sum of £T. 7,303'32 was distributed to 4,372 deserving persons, not including depend ents. The first, in October and November 1912, was conducted by Mr. Muhammad Hasan alone, the second, in April and May, 1913, was supervised by Major Scott, Assistant Resident ; and I personally superintended the third, which took place in Octo ber 1913. (б) Thee bread to the value of JBT.100 was distributed to necessitous persons at Karbala during the month of Ramadhan 1331 A. H., and the same at Najaf. (&lt;?)

(d) Money was lent to 20 pilgrims from India to enable them to return home; and 191 indigent Indian pilgrims, stranded in this country,were sent back to India free of any obligation to repay the money spent on their account. It is intended to supply some of the very poor at Karbala and Najaf with warm clothing and fuel gratis in the coming winter. (J) Annexure A. (c) Annexure B. 5. Kor conyenience of reference two abstracts are attached to this letter, of which the first(5) gives the amounts paid out under the Bequest at the three distributions and the main heads of expenditure, while the secjnd(c) is a table by classes of the numbers of deserving per sons, mostly paupers, who received relief from the Bequest and shows how much was paid to those of each class. 6. As I am about to leave Baghdad and have given close attention during my fe vice here to the management of the Oudh Bequest, I may be allowed to state for the information of Government and of my successors some of the views which practical experience has led me to form. 7. As is now well known, the purpose of the Bequest is to benefit “ deserv ing persons,” and the prescribed intermediaries between the Treasury of the Government of India and the persons intended to be benefited are “ Mujtahids residing at Karbala and Najaf.” Bor some years previous to the reorganisa tion of 1912 the Mujtahids selected as Distributors were left free to deal with the whole of the funds at their pleasure. In practice this meant that they spent nearly all the money on themselves, their relations, and their friends, without any regard to “ deservingness.” Since the reorganisation of the Bequest every Distributor at Karbala or Najaf has been bound to disburse /jaZ/ 1 of what he receives through a Committee composed of himself and his colleagues, or their proxies, and an equal number of members representing the Political Resident, all working under the Presidentship of the British Vice- Consul, Karbala. It was not suggested,^ however, that this system, which the Gov ernment of India sanctioned on my re commendation, should be unalterable in regard to the proportion of their shares which the Distributors are obliged to pay away through the Committees. *Seo paragraph 10 ol my letter No. 6S9 of 11th August 1911. It may be taken as certain that almost nothing out of the moiety which at present is handed over to the Distributors unconditionally goes beyond themselves and their families. As “ deserving persons ” who have undertaken important duties they are entitled to substantial and even handsome remunera tion ; but half of the whole revenue of the Bequest is too much to be absorbed, as a permanent arrangement, by their personal allowances. Not even the whole of the moiety disbursed through the Committees goes to the poor, for from that moiety the honoraria of the Residency Members of the Committees and the wages of various clerks, cashiers, etc., who are a necessary part of the machinery of distribution, have to be defrayed. Less than half the proceeds of the Bequest thus reach the classes which have the strongest claims to consideration, and the position cannot be regarded as satisfactory. The only remedy is to increase the quota which the Mujtabid-Distributors are bound to distribute through the Committees, but an abrupt movement in that sense is not to be recommended. Some of the present Distributors had their personal gains largely cut down in the reorganisation of 1912, yet acquiesced iu a becoming manner and are supporting the new system. To subject those who have suffered loss and whose conduct has been unexception able throughout—for example Saiyid ’Ali, Tangabuni—to fresh reductions would be a harsh measure, and, being an unexpected one, might even be regarded by them as a breach of faith. And it would be impossible now to treat differently from the others those Distributors whose shares were at one time suspended but have since been restored. I think therefore that the pre sent Distributors,—those whose names are given in paragraph 3 above,—should be allowed to hold their shares for life or good conduct on the condition on4 which they received them, namely that of throwing into Committee funds only half of what is drawn from the Treasury on their receipts. But Distributors appointed to vacancies hereafter might be required, as a condition of appoint ment, to agree to surrender more than half of their shares to the Committees. In this way the “ personal shares ” of the Distributors might be gradually reduced, by a series of individual changes, from one-half to one-third of their “ Treasury shares and later again from one-third to one-fourth or less. 8. In the last paragraph reference has been marie to the honoraria of Residency Members of the Committees and to the salaries of various Bequest employes.' These items are capable of being regarded as payments to “ deserv ing persons ”, and they are classed as such in the accounts ; but they are also expenses of management, and as such should be kept as low as possible. VigD lance will probably be required to prevent their being multiplied in number and increased in amount. As shown in paragraph 3 above there are now 7 Residency Members of Committee at Karbala and 7 at Najaf, corresponding to the number of Distributors at each place, and their present remuneration is Rs. 30 or £2 a month each. This rate does not seem to me excessive in pre sent circumstances, for it is essential to secure the services of men of good posi tion, and the new arrangements are still in their infancy ; but the total cost of the Residency Members is £336 or £T. 373 a year,—a heavy percentage on the funds that they help to administer. The remuneration of Residency Members was fixed by the Committees themselves in consultation with the Resident when it was thought that distri butions could be held quarterly, but the work of distribution has been found so arduous that I question wdiether it can well be undertaken more than tvyice in the year. It may be possible later, by fixing the allowances of the Residency Members per distribution instead of per month, to effect an economy without giving rise to difficulties. 9. In view of the vicissitudes and changes through which the Bequest has passed during the last two years, it will be prudent to avoid important innova tions for some time to come. This remark applies to the projects mentioned in the next paragraph as well as to the matters discussed above. 10. I have remarked * before on the great good which might be accom plished bv means of a school and a hospi- 1 K Mr. RSQ.P r - . „ ^ , .... . 1 or Najaf. The Turkish medical arrangements at those places, though there is a large hospital standing empty at Karbala, may be discounted as perfectly useless to the poor ; and the amount of preventable or remediable disease, especially eye disease, which prevails is truly deplorable. Everyone who has reached middle life in the East has witnessed much misery due to disease and become in some degree callous to it ; but I venture to assert that no one, how ever hardened, could see the crow r ds of blind and semi-blind of both sexes and all ages including small children,-and of cripples and paralysed, which the Oudh Bequj^ejt distributions draw together, wdthout being harrowed in his feelings. The main difficulties in the way of establishing either a school or a hospital at Karbala under the Oudh Bequest are two : Eirst, opposition by the Turkish Government and its local representatives to what they will almost certainly regard as the creation of new British political interests ; and, second, a crude interpretation of the Oudh Bequest Agreement of 1825 according to which it is necessary to distribute the proceeds of the Bequest in cash to the benefi ciaries and is not allowable to spend the money, or even a part of it, for their benefit. *See paragraphs 14 and 15 of my letter No. 689-C., of 11th August 1911. tal at Karbala. That a school is wanted has been proved by the action of the Indian Community in establishing-)- one 19.2, HI, 2. cial side, leaves much to be desired. The great need for a hospital will not be questioned by any one who knows Karbala- . ~ ^ bnat ctu or aiv least a strong majority of those who administer the. Bequest should be agreed as „ t 0 , the desirability and propriety of a ; hospital and school being main tained out of Bequest funds. At present there is no- such unanimity the narrow construction of the terms of the Bequest to which I have referred*being held, I understand, by a number or even most of the present Distributors and other members of the Committees. Some of them, I am told, do not regard with favour the grants which are made to the Resident for the maintenance of guides to assist Indian pilgrims. Por the reason mentioned in paragraph 9 above it would probably be inexpedient to press any scheme for a hospital or a school on the Committees at the present moment ; but their attitude, with tactful and patient handling is likely to become more liberal; and eventually they may be brought to understand the claims of institutions which are capable of benefiting the poor in a higher degree and a more permanent manner than money doles ° When the funds available for distribution by the Committees have been increased by gradual reduction of the Distributors personal shares as suggested in paragraph 7 of this letter, there should be ample money both for maintaining a hospital and a school and for continuing pecuniary relief to the poor ou a lar°ge scale. 11 . All the revenue of the Oudh Bequest to the end of September 19 1 3 has been paid out, and there are no arrears now undrawn or in deposit in the Baghdad Residency Treasury. The only drawn but unexpended sum apart from the “ Central Pund ” and “ Pilgrim Arrangements Punds ” presently to be mentioned, is one of £T. 38T3 which remained over in the latest distri bution at Karbala and will now probably be credited to the Central Fund. 12. The balance of the (Karbala) Central Fund on the 31st October 19,3 was£T. 1,663-33 and that of the Pilgrim Arrangements Fund was £ T. 326 39. Karbala Committee. The system of keeping the accounts of the Oudh Bequest at Baghdad has been further improved, and a special steel cupboard has been provided in the Residency for the safe custody of vouchers, receipts, books of account, and other papers of importance connected with the Bequest. 13. A list of accepted candidates for Mujtahid-Distributorships is now kept up by the Resident, but confidentially. All applications received are con sidered, “ ijazahs ,5 are carefully examined and weighed, and inclusion or exclusion of names takes place only after the Vice-Consul at Karbala has been consulted. The existence of a waiting list, prepared and revised at leisure, greatly simplifies matters when a vacancy occurs and applications pour in. It also affords security against unsuitable, because insufficiently considered, appointments. 14. I cannot close this report without bringing to the notice of the Govern ment of India the excellent services rendered in connection with the Bequest since its re-organisation by the British Vice-Consul at Karbala and the Accountant-Treasurer of the Baghdad Residency, Mr. Muhammad Uasan Muhsin, K. B., has succeeded in the face of extra ordinary difficulties iu bringing about the selection by the Karbala and Najaf Committees as beneficiaries under the Bequest of hundreds of deserving poor who, if matters had been left to take fiheir course, would have been passed over in favour of persons by no means so well entitled to relief. He has devoted infinite pains to personal investigations which many would have shrunk from as repulsive, and he has incurred mm;h odium by his firm maintenance of the principle that distress and poverty, not personal interest with Distributors, should govern the selection of recipients. August 1912. * See paragraph 8 of my letter* No. 764 of 28 th 1 he nature of these funds was explained lljrnst 1912. • 1 i 1 -r- . ... * in my last report.* It is possible that the Najaf Committee viill establish a Central Fund this year, similar to that of the 126FD6 4 Mr. Mesrop Thaddeus lias given a great deal of thought and labour to working out a system of accounts for the Bequest in all its ramifications, and the result has been eminently satisfactory^ He was sent by me to Karbala and Najaf at the time of the distribution in spring 1913 to examine and improve the' system of local accounts. All the headquarters papers and accounts of the Bequest are prepared by him with his own hand under the supervision of the Resident, and the result is a very heavy addition to his former duties as Accountant-Treasurer. Both the gentlemen in question have carried on the extra work imposed upon them since the re-organisation of the Oudh Bequest with cheerfulness, and even with enthusiasm, in view of its beneficent object ; and this they have done without any addition to their emoluments. 15. It would be convenient if this Residency could be supplied with two printed copies of the present letter for record and easy reference. /ANNEXTJRE A.

In accordance with Mr. Lorimer’s agreement with the Vilayet great care was taken at both places to exclude* all Otto- *See Summary for May 1912—VI, 3. maIL su bj e cts from participating in the distribution. Mr. Muhammad Hasan briefly sums up the feature of the Karbala distribution as follows: “ I thank the Almighty that the whole affair passed very pleasantly nauch more so than the previous distribution and we met with no hitch whatever in the course of business. It is enough to say that when the distribution was ended friends and enemies were equally pleased and the Acting Mutasarrif thanked me in person.” In regard to Najaf, he writes “ x was very much struck with the friendly attitude of the Qaimakam and the censures which he passed upon His Excellency Jamal Bey (the late Wall of Baghdad) for his administrative mistakes, among which he counted the disappointing of the Turkish paupers. “ At subsequent meetings he suggested to me to disregard the prohibition and to extend the charity to any deserving Arabs, whom I knew, if not openly then under false names. I naturally refused the sug gestion.” Beferring to the difierence between the last distribution and the present one at Najaf, the Vice-Consul writes “ On this occasion all had changed, our critics and even some of our enemies had become friends, and, besides the common students, scores or higher class Mullas and some Mujtahids came before the Committee and received assistance at the rates which common paupers were 0 receiving. “ The Committee on their part did their best to please the visitors in order to encourage other people and make the system more popular than before. The result was, therefore, a distribution of which the mem bers are really proud, and, in proof of this, it is enough to say that a man like Muhammad Kazim Yezdi was among the thousands ot those who eulogised the distribution in Najaf and Karbala.” Shaikh Fazl-UUah, sonof Hijjat-ul-Islam, Shaikh Hadi. Mujtahid of Karbala, and also Saiyid Muhammad Ja’afer Shirazi, Mujtalnd of Najaf have both written congratulatory letters to the Eesident and at the same time asking to share under the new scheme. The Honorary Secretary of the All-India Shia Conference has also sent a con gratulatory letter to the British Consul-General in which this passage occurs “ It cannot be denied that our British Government has a great regard for its Indian subjects and is ever anxious to adopt all those possible means which add to their comfort and ease. So I, the Honorary Secretary of the All-India Shia Conference, beg to express my heartfelt thanks to you and the British Government on behalf of the entire Indian Shia community.” 4CONFIDENTIAL. r: Enclosur ■■ ' 'sr In- n F■ -~&gt;t 4 ’1, datstf 31 OCT No. 764, dated Baghdad, the 28th August 1912.

It would consequently be a work of supererogation to give a complete narrative in this place of the progress of the reorganization ; but, as I am about to be absent from Baghdad for some months under the orders of Government, it seems desirable that I should place on record the latest developments and the present position. My chief reasons for doing so are the unsettled conditions which locally still prevail in regard to the Bequest, arising from Persian and Turkish opposition, and the magnitude of the financial interests involved, which lay a heavy responsibility on the Political Resident at Baghdad or his locum tenens. It will be remembered that in March and April last Oudh Bequest Com mittees were constituted under the new system and performed excellent work in causing the moiety of the funds with which they had power to deal to reach the classes of persons for which the money was intended by the King of Oudh. With the exception of two distributors at Najaf, who declined to attend and were consequently dismissed, all the existing distributors then present at Karbala or Najaf, took part, either personally or by proxy, in the distributions, and appeared to concur in the new system. There were in all three absentees, two from Najaf and one from Karbala, whom an agitation connected with Persian politics had drawn away from their homes to Kazimain near Baghdad. The Najaf absentees after their return received their allotted shares, each relinquishing half of his share to the Najaf Committee, the creation of which they thus accepted in principle; but the absentee from Karbala, who has been the leading opponent of aU reform from the first and who is no other than the same Shaikh Husain (Mazindrani) mentioned in paragraph 10 of my letter No. 312, dated 11th April 1910, could not be brought to recognise the Committee system and continued to work secretly against it. When the negotiations with him finally broke down, after having lasted more than two years, I informed him, as Government are already aware, that his name had been removed from the list of distributors. 3. At the time of the distributions in March and April, and for a while after wards, the attitude of the great majority of the former distributors seemed not unfavourable to the recent change. But on the 1 ith of July 1912 there appeared in the “fZhhur”, a Baghdad native newspaper, a copy of a petition against the new Oudh Bequest arrangements, addressed to the Shaikh-uMslam at Constantinople and to the Wali of Baghdad and purporting to be signed by all or nearly all of the existing distributors except those of them who are British Indians and one Persian. The origin of this petition must be sought in a political combination between the Karbala and Najaf malcontents headed by Shaikh Husain, on the one hand, and Ahmad Jamal Bey, then Wali of Baghdad, an ardent Chauvinist who has since disappeared from power with the party of “ Union and Progress ” to which he belonged, on the other. A chief motive of the hostile ‘ Ulama was no doubt their objection to the publicity and supervision which are the principal safeguards introduced by the new 'system of distribution. The late \Vali, who, it will be remembered, also tried to upset the arrangements for assisting British Indian pilgrims in force in this country, was most probably actuated by dislike of the prominence of foreigners in a creditable underaking; and he had perhaps special 1h objections to anything that seemed to tend to direct friendly relations and asso ciation in philanthropic work between the Muhammadan inhabitants of this country and the British consular representatives. I regret to be obliged to attri bute such motives to a Turkish official, but I believe them to have been the real ones, and I had ample opportunity of studying the late Wall’s characteristics. ^ 4. Although there was little doubt that the signature of the petition by the distributors had in some cases been obtained by Turkish official intimidation,— the late Wali, it may be observed, always spoke of Mujtahids with contempt and his recent treatment of all Persians has been arbitrary and severe in the extreme,— it appeared necessary to call upon the distributors concerned to account for the inconsistency between their previous attitude towards the new system and their sudden attack upon it in a document published by the press. I accordingly wrote to all the Persian distributors in terms which have already been reported to Government. .As I had promised the Wali that I would not, pending orders from Constantinople, deal directly in matters relating to the Bequest with Ottoman subjects, I did not address the single Ottoman distributor; and, as the Indian distributors were known to be in favour of the new system and had not signed the petition against it, no enquiry was made from them. In reply to my principal questions, viz., whether they accepted the new system and would give it their support in practice, letters have now been received from all the nine Persian distributors. Five are regarded by the Vice-Consul, Karbala, and my self, who have examined them together, as unsatisfactory, and the remaining • Saiyid Muhammad Baqir (Tabatabayi). four as satisfactory. The four satisfactory replies include one from the most* impor- t Shaikh Muhammad Hasan (jawahiri). tant distributor at Karbala, one from af* t Saiyid ’Ali (Tangabuni). highly respectable and influential distribu- , v . tor at 'Naj^ and another fromj one of t e jess known distributors at Karbala, who, unlike the rest, abstained from signing the petition to the Shaikh-ul-Islam. 5- Before deciding on the line of action now to be followed, it is necessary to consider what the attitude of the Turkish and Persian officials here towards the management of the Bequest is likely to be in future. These officials former ly seemed to consider the Bequest as a matter which did not concern them but the action of the late Wali has invested it with a political and international character which it may not easily lose. Doubtless the Turkish Mutasarrif and the . ersian Consul at Karbala have already seen themselves, in imagination, dipping into large funds secured to Ottoman and Persian subjects under their control together with unrestricted liberty in the spending of the same, by the official intervention of the Turkish supported by the Persian authorities. If the idea has taken root in their minds it will be difficult to eradicate. r 0tner han d' as Government are already aware, I referred the question ot the Walls narrow-minded interference (in refusing to let Turkish subjects connect themselves with the Bequest so far as under British direction) to His . rltan £ lc Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, and the result was encourag- mg From His Excellency’s reply it appeared that the Turkish Government of the day, though st ill ^^hat nmc a Unmn an d Progress” Government, had ordered the Wah not to obstruct the working of the Bequest provided that the Ottoman subjects nominated by the Resident to assist therein were not persons against whom there were special objections. His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassa dor left it to my discretion to initiate a fresh discussion with the Wali or to wait upon events; and, in view of the furious prejudices and xenophobia of the Wali, to uhom I had already spoken three times on the subject, I thought it more prudent to adopt the second alternative. ^ staad ^- exce P t that J a mal Bey has departed from Baghdad, and h h t K hlS Ur ! 10n ^ d Pr °g ress ive” Government at Constantinople has fallen and has been replaced by another of which the policy in this province is as yet3 6. After a careful review of the whole situation I am taking the following action, which seems to me the most appropriate in the circumstances, and which will, I trust, be approved by Government:— (a) I am leaving the cases of the five Persian distributors who have sent unsatisfactory replies, also the case of the Ottoman distributor whom I am precluded from addressing, undecided; and their shares will therefore, for the present, remain undrawn. It is to be hoped that they will in the end, especially if the policy of the new Turkish Government should be one of non-interference, unreserv edly accept and loyally co-operate in working the new system of distribution. (i&gt;) I am continuing the four Persian distributors who have sent satis factory replies and all the Indian distributors, three in number, in the enjoyment of their shares; and for the purpose of giving practical effect to this measure I am instructing the Vice-Consul, Karbala, to hold partial distributions by means of committees consisting of the distributors mentioned, of an equal number of Residency nominees, and of himself, as required by the new scheme.' It would be unfair to make the poor, or even the willing distributors, wait any longer for the benefits to which they are entitled merely because of a recalcitrant minority of distributors and of the possibility of Turkish official obstruction. The distri butions will be limited, of course, to the shares of the willing distri butors ; and I shall instruct the Vice-Consul, in accordance with the understanding not yet formally annulled between myself and tha Wilayat, that the benefactions should not be extended on the present^occasion to Ottoman subjects. If the Vice-Consul should meet with serious obstacles in trying to carry out these instructions he will refer to the Acting Resident for orders. (c) I am appointing another Indian distributor at Najaf, where there is a vacancy. This will give two willing Persian distributors and two Indian distributors at Karbala and the same at Najaf, and in this way the work of the Bequest will be far from being brought to a standstill. 7. It would be premature to discuss at length what steps may have to be taken if opposition to the new system increases or extends, especially as this is unlikely to occur provided the Turkish Government do not actively interfere in the interest of the malcontents, and that no concession of principle is made on the demand of the malcontents themselves. If, however, matters should become more difficult, it may be necessary to fall back, at least temporarily, on the • m 1 ff \ T q.. * exclusive agency of Indian Mujtahids. My letter No. 489 of 18 th June 1912 , para- \x;vu * * y t 1 graphs. F With a view to this emergency I have already* addressed the Government of India, suggesting that suitable candidates for distributorships may be held in readiness in India; for the supply of Indian Mujtahids here, whether as regards number or quality, does not appear adequate to the creditable working of the Bequest. The funds set free by the withdrawal of all Ottoman and Persian distributors would be so large as to afford attractive prospects to suitable Indians from India whose learning and philanthropy were greater than their financial resources at home. 8. In concluding it is necessary to say a word about the practical financial details of the Bequest. The unsettled period through which the Bequest has been passing during the last two years, the frequent changes in shares, and the supervision of expenditure by the Resident, who is also the agent of the Karbala Oudh Bequest Committee, in managing the pilgrim arrangements maintained by it for the last two years and in disposing of matters, such as the repatriation of indigent Indians, have given rise to a large mass of accounts. These are very carefully kept in the Baghdad Residency Treasury, and it is necessary that they should continue to be so kept.The proceeds of the Oudh Bequest have been drawn from the Government Treasury up to the end of February 1912 with the exception of Rs. 13,625*11-5 belonging to Karbala and Rs. 10,462-10-6 belonging to Najaf. These amounts are made up of allowances standing in the name of certain deceased distributors and of Shaikh Husain (Mazandarani), who was under suspension from February 1910 and has now been dismissed. They will eventually be paid to the distri butors appointed in place of the persons mentioned, and in ^ the meantime they have been left undrawn to avoid the unnecessary inconvenience of bringing so much money into current account. There is, besides, an Oudh Bequest “ Central Fund ” at Baghdad, consisting of money drawn from the Treasury on the signatures of various distributors, but not yet disbursed. It is composed of the 2*5th portions of their shares volun- tarily surrendered by certain Karbala distributors before the coming into force of the new system, which were placed in deposit, and of the allowance of a deceased distributor from January 1910 to December-January 1911 which was drawn, originally, for the purpose of being given to his successor when appointed. No successor was appointed in the latter case during the two years as the question of a change of system was then under the consideration of Government. The “ Central Fund ” is drawn on for various purposes from time to time by the Committee of Karbala, to which it belongs, and a statement of income ana expenditure is prepared monthly at Baghdad and sent to Karbala for signature by the members of the Committee, after which it is countersigned by the Resi dent. The cash balance of the “Central Fund” is kept in the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Baghdad. It amounted at the end of July 191210 ^.T.2,426.41. The vouchers for expenditure are kept in the Baghdad Treasury. A separate account is maintained of the sums allotted by the Karbala Com mittee for pilgrim arrangements and expended by the Resident on their behalf in wages of staff, contingencies, etc. The procedure in the case of this account is the same as in that of the “ Central Fund ” and the cash balance is likewise kept in the Imperial Ottoman Bank ; it amounted at the end of July 1912, to ^.T.36.15. The vouchers are kept in the Treasury at Baghdad. The Committees at Karbala and Najaf are responsible for the accounts of the sums which they draw from Baghdad through their distributor members for local disbursements.b X fcr &lt; lK/c^yto ^ CCi S^C.jV^(jU.

The Turkish authorities seem inclined to persist in their intimidationf of natives of the country, other than British subjects, who connect themselves in any way with the Oudh Bequest* The British Vice-Consul, Karbala, reports that many of the Persian paupers at Najaf who received alms in the last Bequest distribution have been sent for and threatened by the Qaim-Maqam. The policy seems to be to single out those whose claim to Persian nationality is at all weak, and, by alarming these, to spread a general panic. On tour at Tawarij and Hillah Mr. Muhammad Hasan received hearty congra tulations from Shbahs of some religious prominence on the late successful reor ganisation of the Oudh Bequest. At Tawairij his interlocutor was Saiyid Hadi jThis is the man who attacked the manage. (Qazvini), ‘‘the most influential resident ment of the Bequest two and a half years ago. and landed proprietor ” at Hillah it was See Summary for December 1909—January gaiyidj Muhammad (Qazvini), a lead- loio, vii-i. i n g local ecclesiastic. Their opinions are of value as those of men who do not live at Karbala or Najaf, yet are near enough to be in touch with opinion there, and who have themselves no personal interests to serve.. i It has been necesssary to bring to a settlement the case of the Persian § Muj- §See Summary for March 1910, IX-2, tahid Shaikh Husain (Mazandarani), whose share as an Oudh Bequest distributor was suspended by me in 1910 pending the receipt of orders from the Government of India for the reorganisation of the Bequest arrangements. This is the man who two years ago refused to appear and discuss Bequest affairs, as the other Mujtahid distributors did, and who at the same time would not agree to the ar rangement accepted (and afterwards loyally adhered to) by other Karbala distri butors, whereby two-fifths of their shares were thrown into a common fund to be disbursed by a Committee. After the arrival of the Government of India's orders in January 1912 the British Vice-Consul at Karbala twice, under my in structions, visited Shaikh Husain and offered him a share as large as that of any distributor (and larger than those of all but one) at Karbala, on condition of his accepting the principle established by the Government of India as regards only one half of the share being at the personal disposal of the distributor, and of his under taking to be present occasionally at distributions and at other times to send a representative to them. Shaikh Husain, howepver, adopted an unreasonable and e ven insolent tone to the Vice-Consul and declined to discuss future arrangements until an agreement was reached about his so-called “ arrears ” since 1910. As his colleagues had in the interval been voluntarily disbursing two-fifths of their allowances through the Committee and as the Government of India had accepted the principle that one-half of each distributor's allowance ought to be so disbursed, I had decided that only half of the “ arrears ' should be paid to him personally. The negotiations actually broke down on this point, which he chose to treat as a preliminary one, through his demanding that the whole should be paid him unconditionally ; but it was clear from his whole attitude that he had no real intention of co-operating in the work of the Bequest on the lines which have now been laid down. I have therefore sent him the letter of which a copy* is attached. It should draw from him, in case his position has been in any respect misunderstood, an explanation of what that position really is. The increased share which I had arranged for him (Rs. 800 instead of Rs. 500 a month) has not yet been granted to anyone else, and it is accordingly not too late for him to obtain it by giving satisfactory guarantees of an intention to conform to the new system. Shaikh Hussain is of more importance as a Mujtahid than I had been led to suppose, but this disposition is even more unfavourable than at first appeared, and much of the opposition to reform seems to have proceeded from himself and a brother Uamed Shaikh ’Ali who is a notorious political intriguer and who has worked to the best of his ability on the political suspicions of the Turks. Annexure A to this Summary.© # ANNEXURE A. Co^y of a letter dated 25th June 1912, to Shaikh Husain {Mazandarani), Karbala. Sir, You will remember that when I was at Karbala in the spring of 1910 you de clined, though you were then a distributor under the Oudh Bequest, to meet me and discuss with me the administration of the Bequest. Your share as a a distri butor was accordingly suspended by my order. I now learn from the Vice-Consul at Karbala, who has twice interviewed you on the subject, that you decline—both as regards the future and the past—to ac cept the principle laid down by the Government of India that each distributor shall be appointed and retained on condition of his distributing half his share through a Committee to f c deserving persons This, I may remark, is a very moderate con-1 dition, for the will of the King of Oudh lays down that the whole of the money is to be distributed to deserving persons ; and from another point of view it is not in consistent with complete distribution, for both halves are distributed to deserving persons. I further understand from the Vice-Consul that you refuse to bind your self ever to attend the distributions personally or ever to send a representative to them. In these circumstances it is clear that you are not suitable to be a distributor of the charity, and I hereby inform you that your cessation to be such will have effect from 1910, when you declined to appear for the discussion of Bequest business.

J. G. L. Mud'-v'') 23 iny the Wall's attention under the same conditions of secrecy and prejudice as those of the Pilgrim Agents and the Lambardars. I had already informed 'i - See last Summary, vi-2. Government of the appearance of intri gues j against the reorganisation of the &lt; , r Oudh Bequest and of the seeming connection of the Turkish authorities with them, tA ; c That connection is now established beyond possibility of doubt; and the adverse action of the Turkish authorities is showing itself in two ways, through their own subjects and through the Persian Consulate-General and its nationals. At the end of April and beginning of May, there were privy intrigues on foot at Karbala and Najaf against the reformed administration of the Bequest. Their objective was evidently the restoration of the old corrupt order, under which the Mujtahids were able to make free with the whole of the funds entrusted to them for distribution. The line of action decided on seems to have been the drawing up of petitions to the Shaikh-ul-Islam at Constantinople, the Wall of Baghdad, etc., in which it should be argued that the new arrangements were * contrary to the King of Oudh's Will, to Muhammadan Law, and what not. The petitions were also to contain suggestions likely to dis turb the Porte, e.^., that the distribution of charity as now conducted was likely to increase British prestige in Mesopotamia, that it might lead to sedition, and so on. There seems to be no doubt that various petitions were actually drawn up, and more ly be heard of them hereafter at Constantinople and Tehran. I am informed at some of the Mujtahids distributors, who had accepted the new conditions - drawing money under them, have now signed the petitions. A part, in forward- y these intrigues which were primarily Persian, seems to have been taken by iyid Hasan (Kurd), the Turkish official preacher f who made himself cons picuous at the time of the war agitation, ^See Summary for January, III-2. and by the Mutasarrif of Karbala. These icials seem to have exerted themselves to obtain influential signatures to the titions. The attitude of the Wall of Baghdad to the Oudh Bequest came out clearly my interview with him of the 27th May, when he said that Turkish subjects aid not be permitted to sit on the Bequest Committees at Karbala and Najaf, it all enquiries about the Ottoman poor would have to be made by the Com- ttees through the Turkish local authorities, and that any relief intended by the .mmittees fot poor Ottoman subjects must be disbursed through the same official medium. On my rejoining that the procedure suggested was hardly practicable, and that the result of its adoption was likely to be the virtual exclusion of poor Ottomans from the benefits of the Bequest, he rejoined that this did not matter ; it appeared to me, in fact, that he welcomed this as a probable consequence. I have no doubt, after this, that the withdrawal^ X See last Summary, vi-2. Saiyid Hasan, Hakimzadah, from the Oudh Bequest Committee at Karbala, was dictated by the Wali, also the Saiyid s letter to the papers. I reported the Wall’s views the same evening to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador by telegram, adding that in my opinion the inclusion pf Ottoman subjects in the Committees ought really to be regarded as a guarantee that we had no secret political objects in the distribution; and that, if the Turkish claim to • intervene in Bequest matters were entertained, the way would be payed for similar claim on the part of the Persian Government and so for an internationalisation of the Bequest —which was out of the question. I ventured to suggest that His Ex cellency might be able to ascertain whether the narrow and distrustful views of the Wall were likely to be shared by the Porte. After our interview the Wali sought to entrap me into an admission, by means of an official letter, that a final arrangement had been reached between us on the subject of the Bequest. I replied, however, that I had not intended our conversa tion to form the basis of an official agreement; that I took note of his views, which I had already reported to the British Ambassador at Constantinople ; but that, pending a decision by the higher authoritties, I should abstain from dealing directly with Ottoman subjects in Bequest matters. Certain action which the Wali has seen fit to take by Persian agency seems even less justifiable than his attempts to thwart the work of the Bequest by means of Ottoman subjects. The nature of his indirect action will be apparent from C233FD \' * i.e., all the Persian members of the Oudh Bequest Committee at Karbala. J. G. L. f The Persian Consul-General at Baghdad. J. G. L. 18 the following extracts from a letter, dated 27th May-which I have received from the British Vice-Consul at Karbala. The Vice-Consul writes : “ On Saturday 25 th, the Persian Consul sent for all the members * of the Committee and communicated to them an order which he had recently received fromf Mukarram-us-Sultaneh in repetition of his first letter about disassociat- mg the members from dealing in the matter of the Uudii Request. After leaving the Consulate two of them came to me and explained all that was contained in the letter which was addressed to the Consul in friendly terms, not officiary It was headed by the words Unofficial and Confidential and commenced by Fidayat shayarn, and similar expressions which no senior officer would use to a subordinate directlv under hr control. - J “ Discussing about the members it said that formerly a warning was conveyed to them at the instance of the Wali, but a few days ago it seems that the Committee again set up in the Vice-Consulate and disposed of some papers and accounts which were sent to them from Bagh dad m connection with the Oudh Bequest. The news having reached the Wali he has addressed another official letter to the Persian Consulate-General, in which he has very strongly demanded the prevention of the Persian members, and their giving resignation to the local authorities, t Like Saiyid Hasan, Hakimzadah, see above. ^^ a ™ 0U1 . lc in g f the same in some Baghdad papers J. G. L. as P ro °* °* G leir integrity and submission to the . . order. Should they neglect to do so, the Wali adds, or insist upon attending the Vice-Consulate in connection with the Oudh Bequest the Government will be obliged to scheme out a severe punishment for them from which they would not be able to escape. Similar instructions were sent to the Mut:,sarrif of Karbala and the Consul-General was asked to direct the Karbala Comul to take the necessary steps in con sultation with the Mutasarrif, who would be too pleased to help him in the matter. In stating his own order Mukarram-us-Sultan has impressed a strong abhorrence of his being the medium of preventing people from associating in charitable affairs bW owing to his inability to resist the Wali, he ordered that the contents of His Excellency’s letter should be communicated to the Persians only, formally, without using force or pressure to make them give up their posts. He, however, mentioned that they should be informed of the Govern ment’s attitude towards the money and the Committee, in which if they continue they will probably cause danger to themselves which he may not be able to redress. ^ ^ “ The Karbala Consul showed them the letter and very mildly advised them to hold aloof from the Committee, or else they will suffer from bad consequences. The members gave him different answers ; and there was some argument too, in which the Consul said nothing but stuck to his friendly admonitions which were occasionally expressed wtih feelings of reli gionism and regret for lack of sympathy and patriotism on the part of the members The Mutasarrif was not a partner of the Consul in this warning, and it is thought that in the next sitting of the Committee some of the members will refuse to attend because of their fear from the authorities. ” There seems to be no doubt that the Persian J Consul-General, who is an t See Summary for January, ni-s. eminently sensible man, is really favourable , , to tlle 0u ah Bequest as now managed • witness the following report by the Residency Second Dragoman, an Afghan, who visited him on the 24th o May. Speaking of a tour to Karbala from which he had just returned the Mukarram-us-Sultana “ said that he told the Muitahids that, if they thought he had come for the Oudh Bequest, their idea was simply silly inasmuch as he had not the least connection with the money or a shadow of a title to interfere m the matter. Then I gave him the history of the Bequest and the recent developments, such as the neglect of the Mujtahids of the duty i “stributors, and an outline of the present arrangements. He was very much pleased and said that a man with a single grain of conscience would never like to wrench a morsel from the hand of a destitute and put it into the mouth of a gardan-kiduft (= a thick-neck, i.e., a Mujtahid). His declarations seemed sincere, and his ridicule of the Mujtalnds was hearty. “ I have noted with much surprise that of late an air of independence of the Mujtahids pervades the whole Persian Consulate-General and its staff. The reason is not known . It must be remembered that the Persian Consul-General at Baghdad is, in the present helpless state of his Government and country, very much at the mercy of the Wah and quite unable to protect his own subjects. An instance of this has just occurred in connection with this very matter of the Oudh Bequest On thet le 26 ! 1 Ma y tlie arrest of a Persian subject named Haji Muhammad Taqi (Yazdi)°n a charge of having written favourably about the British management ot the Oudh Bequest in the ‘ Sada Babil, ” a local newspaper, was reported to me. His letter, which appeared in the number of the 24th May, ran as follows, it seems perfectly innocent:—- ed by the Government of India after two years’ deliberation. J. G. L. t This description of the change is not techni cally correct. A moiety of each ’Alim’s, share is transferred by him to the Committee. This is now the condition on which each ’Alim holds his share. J. G. L. “ The Oudh Bequest. ” It is well known that this charitable fund continued to be distributed to the poor by an Ahm at Karbala and Najaf to the amount of 10,000 Rupees a month ( half of which was dis bursed at Karbala and half at Najaf) under the supervision of the British Consulate until the time of Consul-General Newmarch. That officer, when he saw that the said distribufion was not made properly, appointed 20 ’Ulama in order that the money might be distributed by them at Karbala or at Najaf, and each of the said ’Ulama distributed 500 Rupees * but because the poor complained to the ’Ulama of India that the money was not being distributed properly Mr. Lorimer, the present Consul-General, made * a humane arrangement in favour of the poor! * The change was not made by me but order- He divided f the said money into two shares one for the ’Ulama and the other for the poor.’ To distribute the share of the poor he appointed a mixed Committee consisting of Arabs, Persians and Indians under the presidency of the Vice- Consul of Karbala ; and the money began to be distributed in a manner unprecedented for excel lence since the establishment of the said chanty, and all the poor received their proper shares. “ Some persons have thought that this way of distribution is harmful to the policy of the Ottoman Government. This opinion is valueless and is a bad one for the poor. We ask this question : Can the distribution of the said money to the poor, orphans, and widows have any connection with political affairs ? ’ It is being distributed since 90 years and nobody has ever thought that it was harmful. How is it that it is harmful in respect to politics ? Persons who think so must think wilfully in accordance with their personal views. ” “We thank all those who have a share in the good work connected with this great charity. “ More especially we thank Sa’adat Agha Muhammad Hasan Khan Bahadur, British Vice- Consul at Karbala, who always does his best in the matter of the distribution, and we ask him in the name of humanity not to listen to the words of partisans who cause harm to the poor orphans and widows; “We have no doubt that he is a good-hearted and sincere man and that he never ceases from doing good.” “ May God reward him.” I caused the matter to be investigated and obtained, on the 31st May, the fol lowing report from a reliable source :— Haji Muhammad Taqi “ was not put regularly into prison but was detained in a room next to that of the Mudir of Police. It is said that the Persian Consul-General was specially re quested by the Wall not to interfere in this matter as the prisoner is a Persian subject and the Persian Consul-General promised to do so. On 29th instant, the prisoner was asked to furnish a Turkish subject as security, but he could not produce one. The prisoner asked for being tried by the judicial courts under the Press Act, but his request was not allowed by the Wali. “Yesterday in the afternoon he was sent out of Baghdad under custody to be handed over to Persian authorities on the frontier to be taken to Kirmanshah. In the morning, however a strong pressure had been brought to bear upon the Persian Consul-General to intercede for him with the Wali. The Persian Consul-General went and requested the Wali to set him free as the punishment undergone by him was sufficient. The Wali did not agree. The Persian Consul-General then requested him that the prisoner may be given three or four davs’ time to find a suitable security, but this proposal was also rejected. The prisoner was sent out the very evening. “ The Wali is said to be very much put out with the prisoner and considers his article as spreading the influence of the British in ’Iraq to the prejudice of Turkish prestige. “Haji Taqi, the prisoner, is a nephew (sister’s son) of our Vice-Consul at Karbala, and is a Persian subject.” No doubt Haji Muhammad Taqi’s object was to vindicate his uncle's reputa tion, and the desire does him credit; but he has only himself to thank for the conse quences of his rash interference. The Vice-Consul is a British subject, but Haji Muhammad Taqi is not, and I cannot therefore take any sort of steps on his behalf.An interesting and important crisis in the history of the Oudh Bequest has evidently arrived. The Government of India had only just sanctioned a reform of the Bequest arrangements upon conservative lines; but it now looks as if the direct- action of the Turkish authorities and their pressure upon the Persia,n consular re presentatives here might necessitate greater changes. 'I presume that, if the Turk ish Government hold the same views as the local Wali, viz., that no Ottoman si ject can have any connection with or interest in, the Bequest under our mana^ ment, we can only acquiesce. If the Persians allow themselves to be intimidat into boycotting the Bequest as managed by us,—and they have every reason to fc both the will and the power of the Turkish hierarchy to injure them if they hesiti —it is not clear that the British G overnment is in a-ny way bound, or even in position, to argue the matter with the Porte on their behalf. The result of the ab tention of Turkish and Persian subjects will be, automaticallv, to restrict the n nagement and benefits of the Beque; t to B itish subjects, that is to Indians. Su an issue would of course be hailed wh h delight by all Indians; but the question if large one, and there might be disadvantages in the change. In particular, it probable that the influx of Indians from India into Karbala and Najaf would greatly stimulated. This is a consequence which the Turks themselves would ] gret, when they came to realise it; and they will also have to bear the brunt of t wide-spread discontent which will ensue if the very numerous Persian, and few Turkish, poor are excluded from the distributions. lam still hopeful that the matter may adjust itself as far as Persian subjec are concerned: the next distribution will bring this hope to the test. 4. To revert to the subject of pilgrim arrangements, I was informed by Muhammad Qasim 'Ali Khan, a gentleman of good social position from Lucknow, who visited me on the 17th May, tha,t the last time he came to this country on pil grimage, about 15 years ago, it cost him not less than eight shillings to land at Basrah. This time, the Pilgrim Agent assisting him, he obtained his passage to the shore for one shilling. It was a considerable saving in a single item of the expenditure of a single pilgrim at a single place, and I estimate that the money saved to Indian pilgrims in general during a year must far exceed what the Oudh Bequest Committee spend on the maintenance of the Pilgrim Agents. 5. It was only to be expected that the pilgrim arrangements should attract considerable notice in India, but it is in some ways a pity that they have done so. One result is articles in the native Indian press which, though extremely favourable and very laudatory, are apt to be ill-informed and to contain politically tactless re marks. Fortunately, the contents of newspapers published in Hindustani in India are not very likely to come to the notice of the local Turkish authorities, though there is always the possibility of this happening. The connection of the pilgrim arrangements with the Oudh Bequest is generally ignored, probably for want of correct information, and the impression is conveyed that they have been officially instituted by the British Government. In the July 1911 number of the “ShFah Journal”, a review published in the Saran district, I find the following editorial comment, mad 3 no doubt in perfect good faith, but none the less infelicitous from a political standpoint: “ The alertness and energy of the Pilgrim Bureau will not only benefit the Indians; it will gradually become a source of protection to Persian and Bussian Muhammadan pilgrims, whose respective Governments will follow the same lines to provide for their convenience.” This is probably just what the Turks fear. I cannot think of any means for preventing remarks in the Indian press, but they will perhaps cease as the pilgrim arrangements here lose their novelty. I also receive some gratuitous advice from Indian sympathisers, who are un known to me. One such, who appears to be an official in His Highness the Nizam’s library at Haidarabad (Dakkhan) has lately sent me a number of suggestions, some of which are of a very awkward character. One is that letters for India should be collected at Karbala, Najaf, etc., and forwarded to the British Post Office at Baghdad under consular arrangements for posting to India ; this would of course be an unwarrantable encroachment on the rights of the Ottoman Post Office, though presumably there can be no objection to individuals sending their letters by pri vate arrangement from Karbala or Najaf to be stamped and posted at the British^ 3257 / V 18 home, the former 13 months since, and Dr. Stanley has been transferred* to Musal * * See paragraph 5 on pages 14-15. moreover, Dr. Johnson and Doctor Stanley both possess the Constantinople qualifica tion and the local Turkish authorities were informed of this more than a year ago. There was also a summons for a fourth unknown individual whose name appeared Greek, and who is certainly not a British subject at Baghdad. In all the circums tances of the case, I have thought it permissible, for once, to adopt Turkish official tactics and ignore the communication altogether. 154 Captain Hore-Ruthvenf, finding it impossible to travel to Kirmanshah in the present state of Persia, returned to Uee lasfc Summa ^ 2 * * 5 - Baghdad on the 3rd April and took the ^ _ - . Aleppo route for Europe. He drove the 500 miles from Baghdad to Aleppo m days with one team of horses, which nevertheless reached the end of the journey in perfect condition. Mr. Landon though he waited a few days longer at the Persian frontier, was also obliged in the end to make his way back to Baghdad and so to Aleppo. 16. On the 20th of April I received a visit from Muhammad ’Ali Khan B.A. a pleader of Meerut (India), who had spent about a year in Palestine, the Hijaz &lt; ? t j ier Parts of Turkey. He was connected by marriages, he said, with the Amir of Afghamstan, and the ladies of his family were returning to India by sea, while he, out of curiosity, was making the homeward journey overland by Beirut, Baghdad and Bashrah. He had left Beirut on the day immediately preceding the attack by the Italians on two Turkish vessels there. J I did not ask Muhammad ’Ali for his view about the state of Turkey but he volunteered the opinion that it was worse than it had been when he visited the country some years ago under the old regime. He remarked that he respected the sincere _ followers of all religions, but that the present rulers of Turkey seemed to him to have no religion at all.

J In the first case, at the beginning of April, Mr. Davis, of Messrs. McAndrews and Forbes Company, returning at 8 -p. m. to his house, which he had left locked . up found a man emerging from it and grappled with but did not succeed in detain- mg him. The rooms had been ransacked, a lamp lighted, and a number of things placed togetner for removal. 8 Again, in the early morning of the 23rd April, two burglars escaping from a neighbounng house passed through that of Mr. M. G. Thaddeus, the Accountant of this Residency, and fired five shots with a revolver at or towards Mr. Thaddeus’s brother, who came in their way, but without hitting him. Hi Mr. Davis’s case the burglar was a soldier ; and in Mr. Thaddeus’s case also one of the ofienders, who has been arrested, is a soldier. Both incidents have been specially brought to the notice of the Wali with a view to securing that energetic action which is required when the military garrison of a city themselves take to burglary. J 12. A shocking tragedy has occurred at Kadhimain in the house of a British Indian subject, his daughter and her husband or paramour (a Turkish subiect^ haying been murdered m it in broad daylight. No eye-witnesses of the deed are or hcoming, but Abdul Gham, a son of the house, has been arrested, the circums tantial evidence against him being strong, also one or two others whom the Turkish authorities suspect of complicity. A Besidency Dragoman has assisted in the pohce enquiries on the spot and it was to suggestions by him that the discovers of a knife and revolver, which may be important pieces of evidence, was due The only conjee tumble reasons for the crimes d committed by Abdul Ghani-which he himself denies- are that he objected to his sister's doubtful relations with the murdered man, who had, moreover, been a notorious bad character and who as a hmnm, could not have been welcome in a Shi’ah household even as a son or brother I m-law. c 13.

A share of Us. 800 per mensem was reserved for a former distributor, who happened to be absent at Kadhimain, and from whom it was consequently not possible to enquire whether he accepted the new conditions of appointment. Two of the distributors at Karbala were Indians, and so were three of the seven members nominated by the Resident to serve on the Committee formed under the orders of the Government of India for the distribution of the available funds, viz., a moiety of the whole. The rest of the distributors and nominated members of the Committee were Persians, only one of them, a committee member, was a Turkish subject. The greater part of the money disbursed went in charity, and the circumstances of each applicant for relief were most carefully weighed, and, if necessary, investi gated out of doors, by the Committee, before any thing was given him or her. Most of the recipients were sufferers from disabilities as age, blindness, ill-health, or were persons otherwise unable to maintain themselves as orphan children, widows, etc. Grants to individuals capable of earning a livelihood were restricted to a limited number of theological students without means. Such cannot work for their living and study theology, and the Committee considered them to be deserving persons. The table below gives a detail of the poor relieved at Karbala on the present occasion from two months’ yield of the fund (January and February 1912):— Indian men j; Their dependents Indian women Their dependents Persian men «.

T.-2 per mensem ; m a }■ * See V, 7 on page 16 . grant to the Indian* Free School atfKarbala ; in exchange; in wages to a banker, a clerk and a messenger ; and a small sum was reserved for incidental charities until the next distribution. At Naiaf, where there were already three vacancies, three former distributors were confirmed; two former distributors, who refused to attend, probably as not accepting the new conditions, were treated as dismissed ; and one new distributor (an Indian) was appointed. Two former distributors were absent at Kadhimam and their attitude to the new conditions was not known; the shares intended to be conferred on them, amounting to Ps. 1,700 a month, were accordingly reserved. A further sum of Its. 1,000 per mensem was reserved with a view to the possible appointment of two new Indian Mujtahids, about whose qualifications enquiry has been made from the Government of India. The nominated members of Committee appointed were seven, to equal the ultimate number of the distributors; three of of them were Indians, two were Arabs, one was an Afghan, and one a.Turk. The principles of distribution were the same as at Karbala, but at Najaf the proportion of theological students assisted was greater, in accordance with the differ ent character of the place; and the number of Indian recipients of charity was fewer, the Indian colony here being small.A somewhat disagreeable article on the Oudh Bequest new arrangements appeared in the Baghdad newspaper “Riyadh” of the 25th March, m which it was suggested that their motive was purely political; but a later number stated that the action of the British Consul-General in the matter had been quite correct, and that the Turkish authorities had taken measures to prevent political intrigues (apparently on the part of the British Consul-General). I am inclined to at tribute this partial dementi to the influence of the Wall, for there is nothing that the new rulers of Turkey fear so much as to be accused m the press of insufficient distrustful ness towards foreigners. Hostile notices also appeared m the Zulmr of Baghdad; and these have not, so far as I am aware, been withdrawn. There seems to be no doubt that since my return to Baghdad pressure has been put on all the non-British subjects, who joined the Oudh Bequest Committee at Karbala, to sever their connection with it, on pam of expulsion from Karbala, One of them a Turkish subject, has now written to the Zuhur announcing his withdrawal from the Committee, of which he has not yet informed the Vice- Consul or myself; and the Persian subjects on the Committee are known to be in a state of great nervousness. The Turkish subject m question (Saiyid Hasan, Hakimzadah, the host of Lord Curzon when, as Mr. Curzon, he visited Karbala), was a most useful and active member of the Committee, and at the end of the pro ceedings he distributed the whole of his honorarium as a Committee member m alms to the poor; it may be judged that he did not resign voluntarily. The Persian members of the Committee seem to have been intimidated by the Persian Consul at Karbala under instructions from the Persian Consulate-General at Baghdad, which in turn had succumbed to pressure from the Wali of Baghdad; but the Turkish Muta- sarrif of Karbala seems also to have held direct communication with them on the subject, no doubt under the orders of the Wali. It would be a mistake to attach too much importance to the present machina tions of the Turks. Mr. Muhammad Hasan informs me that the last time a change was made in the management of the Oudh Bequest, there were similar intrigues by them and by Persians which resulted in nothing. It is by no means certain that the Persians will allow themselves to be deterred by the Turks from helping in the work of the Bequest, and, if they do, British Indians can be found on the spot or brought from India to take their places both as Mujtahid distributors and as members of committee. But it would be a pity, from some points of view, if the arrangements were to lose their present universal Shi’ah character, embracing Indians, Persians and Arabs alike, and were to assume an exclusively Indian com plexion. 3 Lambardars or headmen have now been appointed* by me in most of the British Indian colonies in Mesopotamia. - ^ Summary for January 1912, VI, 8. ^ ^ headmen at Baghdad itself, four at Kadhimain, six at Karbala, and one at Najaf. A single Lambaxdarwill probably be appointed at each of the following places also: Musaiyib, Tawainj, Samarra. Already the Lambardars are proving useful as a means of communica tion between the Indian community and the Residency, and numerous cases in which registration has been neglected by British Indian subjects have been brought to notice by their agency. 4. The question of providing hostels for Indian Shi’ah pilgrims at the Holy Places is being kept in view. A petition from India that arrangements should be made, and the liberal offer of an Indian nobleman in the same connection, were ’ r T 1Q19 VT ~ mentioned in a former report.j- t/See Summary for January 1912, VI, /. At Karbala it will probably be possible to obtain a lease of a^ large, well-built and centrally situated grain-store owned by Raja Saiyid Abu Ja’far of Faizabad (United Provinces, India) on favourable terms and to convert it at a‘ moderate cost into an excellent hostel capable of accommodating 200 Indian pilgrims, which is about the maximum number ever present in Karbala at one time. Sartaj Jang, Haidarabadi, who offered an annual donation for Indian hostels, will be consulted in regard to this scheme which promises to meet his views admirably. At Najaf it is proposed to hire a good but not very large house, also belonging to Raja Sai yid Abu Ja’far, as an office for distributions under the Oudh Bequest; and this C142FD(( No. 23 of 1912.

I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter dated the 28th December 1908, from Syed Ahmad, whose views on the Oudh Bequest were explained in my letter No. 844, dated the 30th September 1907. 2. The possibility of improving the system of distributing the Oudh Bequest money has been discussed with a very large number of people during the last three years, but I have met no one who defended the present system, or who could suggest any practical improvement. Everyone tells me that the money ought to be spent on charitable objects, and I believe that the really leading Mujtahids might be willing to support Syed Ahmad’s efforts as soon as they saw them bear some fruit. Unfortunately the Mujtahids are men of no experience : they have never seen what we should consider to be a decently managed charitable fund, and consequently they are unable to understand appeals in favour of a reasonable expenditure of the Oudh Bequest money. If there is to be improvement it must come from some place other tjian Nedjef or Karbala, and seeing that the money comes from Oudh I do not think any more suitable agent could be used than a leading Priest of Lucknow. 3. For these reasons I have written a reply to Syed Ahmad encouraging him in his efforts. A copy of this reply, as well as the original, is herewith enclosed for the information of the Government of India. Should it be consi dered free from objection I shall be obliged if it can be forwarded to Syed Ahmad as early as is convenient. 4. I earnestly hope that the Government of India will forward the letter. Should Syed Ahmad fail in the task that he proposes to take upon himself no harm will be done: but if experience proves him to be an honest and capable man he may be able to introduce a system which will be a blessing to thousands of poor and suffering people, and .which will bring credit to the British Government, Dated the 28tL December 1908. From —Syed Ahmad Moin-ul-Olama Allamah-i-Hindi, Mu j tabid, son ot Shamsul Olama Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, Chief High Priest, Deurhi Agha Meer, Lucknow, To—His Excellency the British Consul-General of Baghdad. Most respectfully I beg to lay the following lines for your kind and favourable consideration. 1. When I paid my respects to you in the Baghdad Consul House last time, on the last day of September 1907, I had a talk with you about the Wasika of Nawab Mobarak Mahal, in which I expressed my opinion that it was not fairly distributed. I then introduced Your Excellency with a pro posal for the establishment of a hospital for the poor which was approved by Your Excellency. Unfortunately I, as desired by Your Excellency, could not stay there on account of some domestic affairs which urgently demanded my presence at Lucknow. Ever since that time I was thinking that Your Excel lency will kindly inform me about it through the Commissioner of Lucknow or perhaps consult me about the matter. I still firmly hold the opinion mentioned above, for my experience during my stay at Karbala urges me on to state plainly that there is an urgent need of a hospital for the poor British subjects. It will be far better to spend it for the Indians living there than to spend it for the foreigners according to the Will of the donor. It is possible that according to the donor’s Will the money may be handed over to the Mojawir Mujtahid to establish a regular hospital for the good of the Government subjects. i !I am also ready to take the responsibility of the work on myself if it may please Your Excellency to promise me to help, in which case I shall pay my respects to Your Excellency at Baghdad. Dated the 13th February 1909. From —Lietjtexant-Coloxel J. Ramsay, C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad, To— Syed Ahmad Moin-tjl-Olama Allamah-i-Hindi, Mujtahid, son of Shamsttl Olama Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, Chief High Priest, Deurhi Agha Meer, Lucknow. I was pleased to receive your letter of the 28th December regarding the Oudh Bequest money. When we discussed this matter in September 1907, we seemed to have many ideas in common. I should, therefore, be ready to help you to introduce a more satisfactory system of expending this Trust money. It is important, however, that you should realise that the task you propose is no easy one, and can only be completed after much patient effort. I will tell you a few of the difficulties (1) The Oudh Bequest money is divided into twenty shares, and no share is at the present moment vacant. Money could only be placed at your disposal by me when a share falls vacant. If your scheme was once started subscrip tions might be obtainable from the other recipients, but you would have much opposition at first. (2) I can give the money to whom I please, provided that the recipient is both a Mujtahid and a resident of Karbala or Nedjef. I have no reason to think that you would have any difficulty in proving to me that you are a Mujtahid, but before you are eligible for a share of the money, you must be come a resident (Mujawar) of Karbala or Nedjef. (3) The Resident cannot pretend to control the money once he has paid it to a Mujtahid resident at Karbala or Nedjef. The resident is merely the Executor of a Will, and according to the Will his responsibility ends, and the Mujtahid’s responsibility begins, when the latter receives the money. Still there is nothing in the Will to prevent the Resident selecting as recipients resident Mujtahids whose views are in sympathy with his own. (4) You will have to face great local opposition from those who are in terested in the continuance of the present system. (5) The Turkish authorities may, but are not likely to, make difficulties about allowing a foreign hospital. They will almost certainly demand that the Medical Officers and compounders should obtain diplomas from Constanti nople. t (6) You know the feeling that exists at Karbala and Nedjef towards those who are not Moslems. If the people think that you rely on the Resident for support your local difficulties will be increased, and the intrigues against you will gain strength. (7) Your life will be made a burden to you, at any rate for a time, by im portunate but undeserving beggars. If you are prepared to make a sustained effort with a view to making the money of the Oudh Bequest a really useful charitable fund, I am prepared to help you as far as I reasonably can do so. The only definite promise that I can make you is that I will nominate you as the recipient of the first share that falls vacant after you are qualified to become a recipient. If experience proved that your efforts were likely to meet with success, it might be possible to increase your share of the Oudh Bequest. I have thought it right to describe some of the difficulties that you will have to overcome because it would be disappointing to you (and to nie) to find your task harder than you anticipate. It is far from my wish to discourage you, for I hope you will come determined to surmount all obstacles. You havef\i a great opportunity of being a benefactor to your co-religionists. I am by no means sure that some of the more powerful men in Nedjef and Karbala will not have some sympathy for your views : and if you can organise an influential committee to manage the money you will have made a good start.

No. 170, dated Baghdad, the 17th February 1909. From— Lieutenant-Colonel J. Ramsay, C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of the correspondence ending with your letter No. 142- G., dated the 14th January 1909, I have the honour to forward a memorial signed by a large number of the Indian residents of Karbala and Nedjef, com plaining of the present system of distributing the Oudh Bequest. 2. In the first paragraph of the memorial the petitioners raise the old question as to whether the money should, according to the terms of the Will, be paid to the Mujtahids alone, or to the Mujtahids and Mujawars. This question was discussed at great length in the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 1074-1., dated the 7th March 1891, and decided in favour of the interpretation, Mujtahids only. I, therefore, asked the Vice-Consul at Karbala to call upon the petitioners to state the source from which they had made their quotation. He informs me that the memorial was drawn up in India by Lawyers acting under the instructions of a man described as Majtahid Radhi-ud-Din of Murshidabad. 3. The succeeding paragraphs of the memorial, up to paragraph 12, amount to nothing more than complaints against the Mujtahids, over whom we have no control. The money is made over to them unconditionally in ac cordance with the Will. 4. Paragraph 13 of the memorial suggests as a remedy that a Committee of three Mujtahids should be appointed to properly manage the Bequest money. The suggestion no doubt seems a very simple one to the Indian Lawyers who drafted it, but it cannot be carried out in Turkish Arabia, because three suitable Mujtahids are not forthcoming. I directed the Vice- Consul to see the chief petitioners and to ask them to suggest the names of the three Mujtahids whom they would like to sit on their proposed Committee, and they replied that the Mujtahids should be chosen by the Government. To—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council. The humble memorial of the poor Indian residents of Nedjef and Kerbala in Turkish Arabia. Most humbly and respectfully showeth, The distribution of Mobarak Mahal Bequest Fund was formerly entrusted to the learned men of the Shia sect, at Nedjef and Kerbala, who carried it on for about sixty years; but in consequence of certain complaints against thoseNo. XL. Agreement between His Majesty Abul Muzuffa H Moiz-ud-din Gbazi-ud-din Hyder Shah, King of Oudh, and the British Government on account of a sum which the former has given as a loan to the Hon’ble Com«s any, etc. Bated 17th August 1825. ^dJ o &lt;i*&gt;i j &lt;±3y* tiOjS sLauOL) &lt;—jtva* religious leaders, and in compliance with some subsequent interpretation of the wording of the agreement noted in the margin, the old arrangement has been set aside, and the amount intended to be distributed is now paid to the Mujtahids (High Priests) only in the shape of monthly salaries. This change has proved ruinous to the poor Arabs and Persians, and more so to the Indian residents who now get little or nothing out of that charitable fund. The humble memorialists beg leave to quote in the margin the words of the said Agree ment, article 5, paragraph 3, relating to the allowance of Mobarak Mahal with a fervent hope that Your Excellency will be graciously pleased to recon sider the meanings of the words in question, and to restore the old arrange ment of distributing the sum among the poor people, for the reasons, and under the restrictions stated by the memorialists in the following para graphs :— (1) The “ Sharai-ul-islam,” and other books of Shia religion, noted in the margin, say that all things intended for Sbarabi Lama, Musalik Jawahir-ul-Kalam, i „ i i • „ i Sharahi Kabir, Hadaiq, Mufatihusbarai, Sarair, Charity, obligatory Or Optional, Should gO irsbad, Miftahmi-kirameh, Wasaii, Beharuiunwar. to the learned men, not to be appropri ated by them for their own use, but to be given over to persons whom they find deserving of charity, under the condi tions laid down by the religious law. This is a rule sanctioned by reason and observed everywhere in the world. (2) It was for this same reason that large sums of money amounting to thousands of Qirans and Tumans, were sent from Persia to the learned men of Iraq (e.g„ Mirza Muhammad Husan, and his preceptor, Shaikh Murtaza, etc.), who distributed it entirely among the deserving people, knowing that it was unlawful to reserve any part of the sum for their own use. (3) In Lucknow, too, three lakhs of rupees were annually made over from the royal Treasury to the late Sultan-ul-ulma, Syed Muhammad, and distributed among thousands of the deserving poor. The Sultan-ul-ulma never appropriated it for his own use. (4) The learned men of Kerbala and Nedjef, who are acknowledged as the greatest Mujtahids by the people of Iraq, Persia and India (for example, Haji Mirza Ismail Aqai Sadr at Kerbala and Shaikh Taha, etc., at Nedjef) declined to accept the money in question, in the form of personal salaries, although offered by the British Consul-General of Baghdad. They knew that it was intended for the poor only. (5) On the same principle it is provided in article 5 of the agreement that one-half of the sum should be set aside for Nedjef and the other half for Kerbala and should always be remitted on behalf of the King to the Mujtahids and Mojawirs of the shrines. The remittances being intended for charitable purposes, the Mujtahids are not entitled to receive the sum in the form of their regular salaries. (6) In article 5 of the Agreement in connection with the servants of Sar- faraz Mahal, it is stated that the monthly allowance of any of her servants dying without an heir shall be added to the money dedicated to Nedjef and Kerbala jiiiy ^ l-JjA) jSi £ j ykU*./* These words imply that Mobarak Mahal’s money also is intended to be distributed among the poor, and not to be paid to Mujtahids in the form of personal salaries as is done under the present arrangement. (7) After the death of Mobarak Mahal, His Majesty, Wajid Ali Shah, King of Oudh, at the request of the British Resident of Baghdad, nominated the sons of the preceptor of his Mujtahids, i.e., Mir Syad Ali Tabatabai at Nedjef, and Hujjut-ul Islam, Mirza Ali Naqi Tabatabai at Kerbala, for the disposal of the money. These two learned men, under the provisions of thereligious law, spent the money on charitable items, such as burial of the dead, stipends of student, repairs of mosques, subsistence allowances of the poor, etc. l iie major portion of the sum always fell to the shares of the Indian residents there who had been reduced to straitened circumstances. (8) This practice of utilising the money in this way continued for about sixty years at Nedjef, Kerbala and Kazmain, and hundreds of Muhammadans of various tribes—natives of Arabia, Persia and India were benefited by it, and were all along sincerely thankful and loyally attached to the British Gov ernment. It is not desirable on the part of the benign Government to win over the hearts of a few Mujtahids ignoring the interest of so many poor people, (9) It is not_ a correct impression that the people of Iraq being the fol lowers of the Mujtahids will be gratified to see their religious leaders drawing monthly salaries under the present arrangement, and be more loyally attached to the British Government. They are rather dissatisfied with the present arrangement, finding their own monthly allowances stopped; and have been disappointed of the favours they had been so long receiving from the Govern ment. (10) It is laid down in the said Agreement that the money should always be sent to the Mujtahids and Mujawirs of Nedjef and Kerbala, and the word Mojawirs as explained in the Dictionaries—Qamus, Sehah, Majma-ul-behar, Misbah-i-munir, Majma-ul-behrain, Muntahul-Arab, means neighbours, and in this very sense it is applied to the people residing near and about the holy shrines. This al)so goes to prove that the Bequest Fund in question is not in tended only for the salaries of the Mujtahids but also for the help of Your Excellency’s memorialists. (11) The old practice of distributing the amount among the poor was ap proved of and allowed to continue unaltered by twelve successive Agents to the Governor-General, viz., Colonel Rawlinson, Colonel Campbell, Colonel Herbert, Colonel Nixon. Colonel Miles, T. C. Plowden, Major Robertson, Colonel Tweedie, Dr. Bowman, Qolgncl Talbot, Colonel Mockler and Colonel Lock. (12) Before the new arrangement the work of distribution was entrusted to the Mujtahids of Nedjef and Kerbala, and when the Indian distributor of the said fund removed his head office to Kazmain the distribution was partly done at Kazmain and partly at Kerbala by an Indian distributor under Mujtahid. The following were the successive Arab Mujtahids Mir Syad Ali Tabatabai and his nephew and son-in-law Syed Muhammad Tabatabai in Nedjef; Hujjut-ul-Islam Mirza Ali Naqi, his brother Mirza Abul Quasim, and his two sons, Mir Syad Ali and Syad Baqer in Kerbala. The Indian distributors were Maulvi Mirza Zaki Husain, Mir Ali Ausat, Maulvi Gulshan Ali, Nawab Hyder Ali Khan, Maulvi Nawab Mirza, the same Nawab Hyder Ali Khan, Muhammad Taqi Khan and Nawab Ibrahim Khan in Kerbala; Nawab Ahmed Agha, Mir Mehdi Husan, Nawab Mohammed Hossain Khan and Nawab Agha Muhammad in Kazmain. After these Mujtahids and dis tributors the new arrangement was proposed and brought into effect. (13) To put a stop to all sorts of complaints the best and safest course is to appoint three reliable Mujtahids, an Arab, an Indian and a Persian, each on R300 a month. They will carry on the work of distribution in consulta tion with one another. When they differ on any point, the point must be settled by the majority. They will keep a regular account of the money dis tributed and a register of the recipients; a file of receipts, etc. All com plaints made in writing will be dealt with in a formal way. ^ They will have a regular office with all necessary records. During the lifetime of the King of Oudh, distributors were nominated by the King himself, but now these appointments are at the disposal of the British Government, (14) The charitable funds of a country are, as enjoined by religious laws, to be distributed among the people of that country wherever they may happen to be, and accordingly the natives of India residing in these placesare the proper people to be benefited by the funds. Formerly the number of these Indian residents was very limited and so the benefits of the funds were extended to other people also, that is, to the Arabs and Persians. As this practice has been in vogue for about 60 years, it would be undesirable to put a stop to it at once, and thereby create discontent among the foreign people, the Arabs and Persians who are not the subjects of the British Government; for the present, the money in question may be equally distributed among all the three classes of the people.

I think that the Memorandum has been more kindly received than might have been expected. Karbala and Nedjef are infested with a crowd of religious students, who dominate the Mujtahids and who are firmly determined to get as much as possible for themselves out of all charitable funds. Lately they have been particularly active and conse quently the recipients had to consider how their replies would be viewed by the students. The students have sent me largely signed petitions through some of their number and through the Persian Consul-General begging me to have a certain sum set aside from the share of each recipient for the exclu sive use of the students. I have replied that the recipients can please them selves, but that such influence as I may possess will be exercised on behalf of the really distressed, rather than on behalf of those who are strong enough the influence of the Resident and at the same time decrease his difficulties if it were realised that he had the power to give more than one share to one man : he would then ensure more consideration for Indians and he could recognise the position of the really leading men by giving them two or more shares. Should occasion arise I think that the Resident should exercise this power, unless of course he receives orders to the contrary from the Government of India. t8 Muhammad Jafar Bahr-ul-Ulum. —Says that he has always spent his Share on the poor, his relations and others. Agrees with the Consul-General’s opinion and asks that he he told what he should do. Abdul Hassan, son of Sheikh Radhf. —Says no one looks upon the Oudh Bequest as his personal property, but all distribute it after keeping what is needed for their own requirements. Tries to spend his money on charities and is willing to send monthly lists if the Consul-General would like this. If the Consul-General thinks that the money should be spent on some other object he has no objection provided the money is spent on some form of charity. Sheikh Faihuila, Shariat ul Is'padiani. —Says the Mujtahids dq not think the d.0 are make it impossible for a Mujtahid not to give. The students come from many countries and have no money, it is right and proper that they should be helped. It is impossible to help all the deserving cases and those who are not helped complain. Some persons have obtained Ijazas ” (certificates of fitness) as Mujtahids simply for the purpose of getting a share in the Oudh' Bequest, they have no students, they are known to no one, and such men are better off for having a share. The Consul-General should be able to find out all about these people. If there are any points which are not clear he will expect to hear again from the Consul-General. (No replies from Syed Abu Turab Khumsari and Akund Mulla Muham mad Ali Khorasani.) money is tneir own and would not spend it on tnemseives, even n toid to so by the Consul-General-: further the population of Nedjef and Karbala beggars who are accustomed to eat what they do not earn and they would 'Replies from Karbala. Seyed Muhammad Bakir: who used to be the sole Recipient. —Says that he agrees that the present arrangement is most unsatisfactory. The old sys tem which he always advocated should be reintroduced. Under this {a) allowances were given to the Mujtahids, proportionate to their respective positions : {b) a certain sum was kept for Indians : (c) a certain sum was put aside for public works of charity, such as cleaning the canal which brings drinking water, and also for distribution to the sick and needy : (d) a certain sum was set* aside for students., Seyeds and others. Con siders the Consul-General’s efforts are opportune and promises to assist them to the best of his ability with his sympathy and co-operation. Sheikh Muhammad Hussein el Mazandarani —Says (in rather ambiguous terms) that the Mujtahids distribute to the poor and would accept shares on no other terms. It is a great pity that owing to the participation of um worthy individuals as Mujtahids the reputation of the Mujtahids has beelf diminished. There is no doubt that the Consul-General has the right to change the system of distribution. He formerly used to submit accounts but was asked by Colonel Newmarch not to do so : he is now willing to follow advice in the matter of distribution. The money available is not sufficient for a hospital. Distribution through a Committee is better, but honest and practical men are not to be found. Admires the Resident’s honest admission that it is he who has deprived the destitute. The Resident is certainly responsible for selecting the recipients and had he selected better men the poor would have benefitted and a slur would not have been cast upon the Mujtahids. Is prepared to give a detailed account of malpractices committed by some of the recipients. Seyed Kalbi Bakir Hindi: r One of the two Indian recipients at Kar bala. —Says he thinks the suggestions contained in the memorandum should be anted upon as the best means of putting an end to a scandal. Pays what he can to the residents and pilgrims, but has been forced to pay some of his share to Persians. Moulvi Seyed Murtaza Hussein: The second Indian recipient at Kar bala. —Says he has always paid his charities through a Committee and has lists of his payments : men and women are paid on alternate days. Thinksthat the Indians should have the preference for the following reasons : (1) ihe money comes from India : (2) They cannot get access to the Persian Ulema who treat them with neglect. For these reasons he only gives to Indians and consequently the Persian students dislike him- About two months ago the Persian students tried to make him give Ps. 150 a month, and when he declined on the ground that he ought to give his money to Indians he received a threatening message that he would be got into trouble with the Turkish authorities if he did not pay. If the other Mujtahids agree to distribute through a Committee he too will accept it, otherwise he will con tinue his present system. Muhammad Hadi el Ispahani. —Says he has distributed his share through a merchant whose accounts are open to inspection. Is ready to join with the other Mujtahids in carrying out the Resident’s suggestions'because he thinks the procedure laid down in the memorandum meets the circumstances of the case. It is impossible to satisfy the beggars in this country and complaints theretore cannot be avoided. Seyed Hussein Qumi. Says he will fulfil his duties by spending a pro portionate amount of the sum received by him in charity. Seyed A li Tangabuni. Says he spends Rs. 200 a month or more on stu dents and the poor, the balance he spends on his family and himself He would not spend anything on himself if he could help it. If the Resident objects he will follow any procedure that is laid down; The knowledge that it is impossible to shut the mouths of evil speakers is as old as Moses- Seyed Hashim Kazvami: Through his son. —Says the support of Mujta- hids is a form of charity, in spite of this he gives between half and three-fifths ot his share to Ulemas, students and the poor.

The reforms proposed by Colonel Newmarch, and accepted by the Government of India in their letter No. 1577-E.,* of the 13th July 1903, were most salutary and placed the administration of the Bequest on a very much improved footing. But it was not to be expected that the modified arrange ments introduced in 1903 should be per/fect in every respect; and I gather from both the letters of the Government of India quoted above that those arrangements need not be regarded as final or unalterable. 4. The views of my immediate predecessor, Colonel Ramsay, appear to - some extent from his letter No. 844,^ of —— ■kPe 30 th September 1907; and with his views, so far as they are known to me from that letter and from a conversa tion which I had with him at Basrah, I am in agreement. I consider in fact that some alteration of the actual system has now become expedient. It is the case that the Shi’ah community, both here and in India, hold that a majority of the^present beneficiaries under the Bequest are not disposing as they ought to dispose of the large sums placed at their command. Whether the Mujtahids in question can be compelled to disburse part or the whole of the money in charity, or in any particular way, is a question, however, that does not now fall to be discussed; for thb latest position is that, while Shi’ah opinion gpnerally continues to demand a change of conduct on their part, a large majority Of the allowance holders at Karbala are now happily dis posed to make one. 5. Seven Mujtahids of Karbala, holders of allowances, have voluntarily } The wording of the agreement U joint, hut the f al ?4 , deliTOr ed to me the Mujtahids have signed on separate identical copies. ^agreement Ot Which a translation and SrIwS^l^. difficulty “ t0 tlle s ? ven originals are enclosed in this letter. , . , . ^ Seven duplicate originals have been re ained in my office. The attitude of the eighth allowance holder Saiyid, Husain (Qumi), is still doubtful. The ninth only, Shaikh Husain (Mazanda- ram), wlio is not distinguished above his fellows except by greater turbulence and avarice, has refused to follow the example set by them; and the Govern ment of India will observe that his refusal is a sufficient proof, if one were required, of the others having acted spontaneously. The tenth and only Novembef a lowanCe holder ’ Sai ^ id Muh ammad Hashim (Qazvini), died last 6. It will be seen from the translation of the agreement, enclosed, that tne system of which the introduction is contemplated is one under which each of the signatory would regularly hand over two-fifths of his allowance to a onaritabie Committee for disposal, and that the Committee in question would be composed of the contributing Mujtahids or their proxies, of a equal num ber or respectable persons appointed by the Resident, and of the British Vice- Consul at Karbala, the latter to be President. This scheme is the outcome pro onged discussions at Karbala, and I recommend it for acceptance It would, I believe, clear both the signatories themselves and the Government cnV? J :rom stigma of maladministration under which, in the eyes of the kin ah world they now appear to labour. I think also that the size and composition of the Committee, and the inevitable publicity of its proceed- ei ? sare tlle fun ds disbursed being well spent, in which case they T la n e mUCh ? u f fe ^ mg - In a S ree ing to the scheme the Mujtahids have, I think, been much influenced by the expectation that it will relieve them, as regards three-fifths of their allowances, from the persecution which they now undergo from necessitous students and others: indeed this is evident from the agreement. f? vou . rabl f consideration by the Government of India the recommendation Of the signatories, expressed in their agreement, that the shares of allowance holders under the Oudh Bequest should not in future necessarily be equal in amount. The fact that t£e greater and the smaller soi r rrd ta of 0 tb am0ng th i? all ° WanCe h0l 1 erS ’ and the “°re and “he less pTblic- r k* ' 61 ! i'V-'TV’ en ‘ !0 J' ec i' al allowances is one of the principal recrived 0 !;^ 6 E f tab l lshe . d s y stem ; and a change in this respect is likely tobe received with almost universal satisfaction. I further agree with the Mujta-n bids in thinking that the number of the allowance holders at Karbala should not be determinate. 8. As the proposed Charitable Committee arrangements, though they appear to me to require the sanction of the Government of India, are of great importance and might be prejudiced by delay, I have allowed them, but only m so far as the seven signatories at Karbala are concerned, to come into provisional operation. I trust that, in view of the special circumstances, Government will approve of my action, especially as I have tried to make it clear that I moved in the matter as a collaborator with the Mujtahids, and not independently as Resident. Should Government consider the arrange ments unsuitable, they can be terminated at once and without difficulty. 9. I he attitude of Saiyid Husain '(Qumi), though doubtful, is not un- tavourable. At the end of March, though he did not sign an agreement, he nanded in two-nfths of what he received on account of that month for distri bution by the Committee. I believe that, if the scheme is approved by Government, he will at once throw in his lot with the majority of his brethren. 10- It remains to consider what should be done in regard to the allowance ot the ninth Mujtahid, Shaikh Husain (Mazandarani). I have invited him more than once to visit me for the purpose of discussing the complaints against himself and the others, but he alone of them all has refused to do so. am mtormed that Sheikh Husain is a man of unsatisfactory character, and that he keeps truculent individuals in his employment who terrorise people; and I fear that it is partly the possession of Rs. 500 a month which enables him to conduct himself as he does. Two deserving cases of destitution which were recommended to his care by Colonel Ramsay when he gave him his share under the Bequest were totally neglected by him after the first. I understand that the Resident has power^ to confer and withdraw shares, for sufficient cause, without re ference to Government; and in my ^ .. p humble opinion the preservation of this power is essential^for several reasons; but in the present case, which is some what exceptional at will probably be as well that I should inform Government ot my intentions before putting them into execution. I propose, then, again to request Shaikh Husain to meet me for a di/scussion of Oudh Bequest anairs, and thereafter if he refuses to meet me, or if at our meeting he « T me s to give proofs of public spirit and good character by adhering to the Two-Fifths Agreement accepted by his brethern, to inform him that his allowance is withdrawn, I shall deal with him patiently and not withdraw his allowance unless m the last resort, for it is very desirable that the general c ange which is proposed should be effected without any disagreeable accom- npr^ / 'i im P 0SSlhh r that ? hai kh Husain should be allowed to in hlS ^ efusals t0 th e Resident, or, having met him, to remain the system approved by his fellows; for such refusals, besides being reasonable on the part of a beneficiary towards an ex officio trustee, are lowering to the dignity of this Residency; and successful contumacy on the Shaikhs part may not only affect progress towards reform at Najaf, where si^n^tnriz ^ but may even induC6 one or more of tlle Karbala signatories to repent of their agreement. man w'Jjfwrf 6 ^ th 1 e s ^? r f le | t vacant by the death of Saiyid Muham- nrtfinlfl (Q a zvmi) should be distributed, not necessarily in equal pro- Aoleement M f allowailc ® holders who adhere to the Two-Fifths Dl?dwd tbeTr,^! * + ° f th T e vF have signed the agreement have thereby to ^fe d awaTto tl? 8 t0 “. uc h more than they have been accustomed of ' i,i e P as t; and the distribution of the vacant share among some stances TltTvn ^ 6 ’ • h . 0Ug v h “ ? art onl y- the cl ‘ an ge in their circum- birn it Anf? ® u ® ai n s share should subsequently be withdrawn from and’ dew ruin if d ? a * w ith; or it might be conferred on some new Anh 7 miw J ' 1] ail&lt; w , 10 would be willing to accept the Two-Fifths Agreement. Thus point might, I think, be left to my discretion. Tune 12 ' h have promised to meet the Mujtahids again at Karbala early in , a d, if Government approve of the proposals contained in the precedingparagraphs, it would be convenient if I could be informed of the fact by tele gram in time for my visit, as a second journey to Karbala in very hot weather would then not be required. 13. I should mention that the Saiyid Ahmad referred to in Colonel Ramsay’s letter No. 153* of the 13th - ' — ——-— February 1909, was present throughout the recent proceedings at Karbala, and I believe that the turn which matters have now taken is regarded by him as satisfactory. That he did not strongly press his claims to succeed—conditionally upon his giving proof of Ijtihad— to the vacant share of the Qazvini was due, I think, to his perceiving that the appointment of another Indian at Karbala, where two already hold Oudh Bequest allowances, might compromise those public interests which he is anxjious to serve. The extreme jealousy of Persian Mujtahids towards Indians belonging to the theological class is one of the numerous difficulties by which the administration of the Oudh Bequest is attended. Saiyid Ahmad is an able and ambitious man, but his ambitions appear to be such as, if rightly guided, may serve the public interests. 14. I take this opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of Resolution No. 10 of the All India Shi’ah Conference held in December 1909, which was forwarded to me under Foreign Department Endorsement No. 484-G., dated 8th March 1910. As I am not aware of any other medium through which information can be conveyed to the members of that Conference, pro- babiy srnce dissolved, I respectfully suggest that the Government of India should refer their leaders to Saiyid Ahmad, who has lately returned to Luck now and who will be able to explain to them reasons that make it undesirable to attract too much attention to the proceedings here at the present juncture, particularly the risk of alarming the Persian Mujtahid community a Karbala and Najaf and so making them intractable. The co-operation of The Con- terence and other responsible associations of Indian Shi’ahs is likely to be valuable to the British Resident at Baghdad, and I should therefore be glad it I could be placed at an early date in official communication with any such that advise, or exercise control, in regard to the management of Waqf pro- perty of funds for assisting pilgrims in this country. Private trustees having similar functions could also give useful assistance. A great deal of good can probably be done here, especially in the way of ameliorating the lot of pif- grims, but careful investigation of the facts is an indispensable preliminary, and much patience and discretion will be required. If I were allowed to visit ndia during the sitting of the next All India Shi’ah Conference and consult the leaders of that body, the results might be beneficial; but at the present stage any definite proposal of the sort would be premature. What is now required is a list of responsible Shi’ah associations and trustees m India, with a statement of the interests in Turkish ’Iraq controlled by each.^ I propose, with deference, that such a list should be obtained and communicated to me; but the matter should be treated as a general one dis tinct from that of the Oudh Bequest.

CAnthaL *S\ro t Dated Lucknow, the 6th May 1910. From —Syed Ahmad, High Priest, Son of late Syed Mohammad Ibrahim, the Shamsul-Ulama, Chief High Priest, To—-S. H. Butler, Esq., K.C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Most humbly and respectfully, I beg to request the favour of your kindly putting forth my this humble petition to the notice of the Government and favour me with a reply.I. In the year 1907, I went to Yrak and during my stay there for a year, I studied the condition of the Grants worth some lakhs of rupees made by the Indians and ascertained that they were all an a ruinous state. I talked about them to Colonel Ramsay, then Consul-General of Baghdad. II. On the 13th February 1909, the said Consul-General called me back from Lucknow by a letter through the Foreign Office. III. In compliance with the above letter I again went there and had a talk with him about the said Grants. Chiefly I dwelt upon the Wasiqa of Mobarik Mahal which amounts to Rs. 10,000 and is monthly sent to Yrak and said that this sum is not only meant to support the Moulvis and Mujtahids, as it had been hitherto supposed there, but it extends to the poor, the invalids and the sick. In the month of October 1909, the Consul-General was transferred from Baghdad and was succeeded by Mr. Lorimer. IV. The present Consul-General heanjing my suggestions and proposals about the said Wasiqa of Mobarik Mahal very kindly appointed a Committee of seven men to look after the i ^agements of Wasiqa and chose me as one of the members of the said Committee. The Consul-General set aside a sum of Rs. 2,000 monthly out of Rs. 5,000 from the High Priests of Yrak and made it over to the Committee for distribution among the poor. V. In the month of March, 1909, he personally went to Yrak and asked the Committee to distribute the above sum in his own presence and thus rendered the people thankful to the British Government. VI. Out of that sum of Rs. 2,000 monthly, the Committee offered a sum of Rs. 200 monthly to the Consul-General so that he might with his own direct management and supervision as well receive pilgrims and visitors (going so often and in number too from India to visit their holy places who have often suffered severely at the hands of the free-booters of A jum) from their ships and again send them off to India in the like manner when they have finished their pilgrimage. Accordingly that system of management has been enforced from the month of February 1909. VII. ^ Till March the 27th, 1909, I had been working with the Consul- General in an honorary capacity. After the enforcement of that manage ment, circumstances obliged me to submit my resignation and take leave of the Committee and withdraw to India. VIII. Indians have made numerous grants of lakhs of rupees in Yrak. It is spent in the most illegal way. The Government of Turkey gains at the expenses of the poor subject of the British India. This constitutes a loss of prestige of the British Government and the hard earned money of her subject is lost. IX. Undoubtedly all the managements made for the convenience of visi tors and pilgrims are of much benefit even to the Government. Through the above management the Government might easily learn and detect any of the pilgrims, if he has left his country owing to some objectionable ground. Hitherto all the other corrections made are much benevolent to the Grants. But I beg to draw the kind attention of the Government to still some other points :— (a) The above mentioned Committee should be termed as “ The Com mittee of Grants.” It also includes the Consul-General and the present Vice-Consul-General at Karbala. (b) The people should be asked to entrust all their Grants to the Com mittee so that it might look after them while I too offer my free services for that very purpose and thus we expect a consi derable benefits thereby. (c) Let us try that those houses of Yrak whjich are many in number and have been given by the people of India be considered as a free quarters or lodgings for the Indian travellers, thereby a portion of Yrak might come under the influence of the Government and the travellers from India be under perfect ease.J4(}; -rr 'Hiiofl •lostln oces.

( 2. It appears also that there is some doubt as to the exact text (both English and Persian) of the portion of the treaty of the 17th August 1825 relating to the bequest, and the intention of the donor is thus not clear. If there is no objection and if it is practicable, I am to ask that accurate copies of the treaty as signed both in Persian and English may be supplied. That portion only seems to be needed which in English begins with the words c: This allowance will be paid to the Begam Nabob ” and ends with the words “ derive its benefits.” 3. If this portion of the treaty has before now been under consideration and any authoritative statement of its meaning has been made, I am to ask that the statement may be communicated to this Government.

In conclusion I may refer to a question which has not yet arisen. Some of the stipendiaries of the Oudh m, m, de-patch No. 513-15 rf nth April Bequest at Karba i a have agreed* to hand v over f ths of their allowances hencefor ward to a local charitable committee for philanthropic purposes, and it is possible that the other stipendiaries may shortly follow their example. In that case the charitable committee will have a large annual sum at their dis posal j and they may wish tp spend part of it on arrangements for medical relief to Indian and other Shiah pilgrims. The only efficient and suitable kind of medical officer whom the committee would have it in their power to employ at Karbala would be a qualified Indian practitioner; and to enable him to practise freely, it would probably be necessary to obtaiin a special Com- stantinople diploma as in the case of the Residency Surgeon. Most of his patients however would probably be British or Persian subjects. I mention this matter at the present stage of affairs only in order that no argument may be used in the course of negotiations at Constantinople, of which the tendency would be to endanger the practicability of such an ^arrangement. # # * * X2i r:x- ’ . . tAf'' ,— — No. 774, dated Baghdad, the 3rd September 1910 (Confidential). From— J. G. Lobimer, Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 312 of the 11th April 1910 relating to the Administration of the Oudh Bequest, I have the honour to draw the atten- tion of the Government of India to an article t which appeared m the Habl- ul-Matin ” newspaper of Calcutta in its issue of the 18th July 1910, in which my proceedings as Resident in connection with the said Bequest are criticised. I do not think that the Government of India will wish me to make any obser vations upon this article; and I mention it only with the purpose of stating that the writer, Ali, is the brother of the Shaikh Husain (Mazandarani) who is mentioned in paragraphs 5 and 10 of my letter quoted above. 2. The questions connected with the Oudh Bequest which I have had the honour to submit to the Government of India are important and deserve the fullest and most mature deliberation; and I would not be understood to press for early orders upon them. At the same time there are disadvantages in 431 r. n. os’*■nTtlll -rrf- 194j&gt;. delay, especially the possibility that the Mujtahids who have agreed to dis burse two-fifths of their allowances in charity may be successfully worked upon by others and induced to repent of what they have done. I may also mention that I have for some time been receiving offensive letters, frequently anonymous or signed with false names, abusing me for my conduct in relation to the Bequest. In one of those lately received I was accused of having myself embezzled the sums connected with the Bequest which are held in deposit here pending receipt of the Government of India’s orders. (The accumulation of these sums, which cannot at present be in cluded in the Treasury accounts, is in fact a source of inconvenience.) As the Government of India are well aware, it is ampossible to move in any matter affecting Karbala and Najaf without exciting the hatred of some section of the excitable and unscrupulous Persian communities at those places; and, though the attacks which ensue are disagreeable to the object of them, there ds no reason why they or their ramifications in India and elsewhere should be treated as of serious importance. The article in the “ Habl-ul-Matin ” is surprising chiefly for its modera tion which is greater than might have been expected, and ds shown in an entire absence of personal abuse. 3. The Government of India will see, from copies of despatches to His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople which I am submitting to them by this mail, that I am much engaged at present with inroads, actual or threatened, by the Turkish Local Government at Baghdad upon the property and rights of British subjects here. At this moment I could not safely leave Baghdad, even for a day; but I hope that the crisis will soon pass, and that, by the time the Government of India’s orders on the Oudh Bequest reach me, I shall be in a position to proceed to Karbala and carry them (into effect. 4. In conclusion I would draw attention to paragraph 14 of my last letter to the Government of India about the Oudh Bequest, in which it was indi cated that the matter of Shi’ah trusts is distinct from that of the Bequest and does not require to be considered in giving orders on the latter.19T No. 2422 -G., dated Fort William, the 29 th Novemher 1910 .

A doubt has been raised as to whether the original engagement in Persian, sealed sviith' the seal of the late King (marked No. 1 in the margin) which contains a ver sion of the passage in question somewhat different from those contained in the other texts, was examined in connection with the enquiry as to the meaning of the passage which led to the orders of 1891. 3.

HOSE, Chief Secretary to Government, United Provinces, The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, F OREIGN DEPARTMENT. Dated Allahabad, the l%th March 1911. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with Major Patterson’s letter no. 36lG., dated the 22nd February 1911, I am directed to submit for the orders of the Government of India the views of the Lieutenant Governor on the subject of the Oudh bequest at Karbala and Najaf. 2. In Mr. Wood’s letter no. 1089G., dated the 21st May 1910, forwarding certain proposals made by the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia for the better administration of that bequest it was asked that the feeling of the Lucknow Shia community might be ascertained and reported to the Government of India together with the Local Govern ment’s opinion on the matter. Subsequently in Major Patterson’s letter no. 2422G., dated the 29th November 1910, three photographs were for warded of the papers forming the treaty under which the bequest was constituted, and it was remarked that a clause in the original deed exe cuted by the King of Oudh appeared to have been overlooked in previous discussions. The Lieutenant Governor was asked to give his opinion also as to the interpretation to be put on this passage. 3. As to the former point, I am to say that Mr. Lorimer’s pro posals were discussed by the Commissioner of Lucknow with representa tives of the Shia community and were considered at an informal conference with a number of prominent Shia gentlemen. The Commissioner writes as follows : “ Rdja Abu J’afar of Pirpur when passing through Luck now favoured me with his opinion and the matter was discussed with other gentlemen. It appeared however that the best means of carrying out the directions of Government would be to convene a small meeting of leading men of the community concerned where views and experiences could be exchanged. The following gentlemen were invited to, and atten ded, the meeting :— (1) S. Ndsir Husain, Mujtahid. (2) M. Saiyid Ahmad, Mujtahid. (3) Nawab Mehdi Hasan (Kgha Abbu Sahib). (4) M. Muhammad Shams-ud-din Haidar. (5) Nawab Murtaza Husain. (6) Shaikh Hamid Ali Khan, Barrister-at-Law. (7) Shaikh Yusuf Husain Khan, Barrister-at-Lavv. (8) M. ShahinsMh Husain. (9) M. Saiyid Mukhtar Ahmad. (10) Saiyid Mehdi Hasan, Rizwi.Number (1) is the head of the Lucknow Mujtahids. No (2) is the originator of the discussion. The Abbu Sahib, besides his social posi tion, is a great authority on Karbala and Najaf, which he has visited five times. He and no (4) are the Husainabad trustees (the third is not in Lucknow). Nos (8) and (9) are the gentlemen mentioned in paragraph 4 of the government order in connection with the resolution of the Shia Conference. The others are also prominent leaders of the community.” The opinion of these gentlemen was that the ap pointment of a charitable committee suggested by Mr. Lorimer was an excellent plan, but the limitation of the amount to be devoted to charity aroused protest. The effect of Mr. Lorimer’s proposals, if carried out, would be to deprive the recipient mujtahids of two-fifths of the income which they now enjoy under the bequest, and to devote this money to charity under the management of the Resident and an advisory committee. The conference raised the pertinent question why the proportion to be devoted to charity is to be limited to two-fifths. If the allowances are personal to the mujtahids, it is too much to ask them to give two-fifths in charity. If the mujtahids are merely agents of distribution it is too much to allow them to keep three-fifths for themselves. While therefore Mr. Lorimer’s plan is approved as being a step in the right direction, it is not regarded as a completely satisfactory solution of the problem. 4. Mr. Lorimer s proposals imply the acceptance of two principles which formed the main features of the reforms instituted by Lieutenant- Colonel Newmarch ; firstly the distribution amongst a number of muj tahids of sums approximately equal; and secondly the repudiation on the part of the British Government of all responsibility for the use made by the recipients of this money. The latter principle, it must be admitted, had apparently always formed part of the policy of the British Govern ment, but in practice a good deal of control seems to have been exercised by successive Residents over the disposal of the money. These two principles were restated in an emphatic form by the Government of India in their despatch no. 1577E. of 13th July 1903. In that letter it was laid down “. . . that the income of the bequest should be distributed under the supervision of the Resident to a certain number of mujtahids . . . probably not less than ten or more than twenty at each place . . . residing permanently at the shrines of Karbala and Najaf . . . and that it is not a mere charitable grant for the benefit of the poor of those places . . . No official cognizance will be taken of any distribution other than that to the mujtahids themselves.” On both these points Shia opinion in Lucknow is opposed to the attitude of the Government of India. The Commissioner of Lucknow was informed that there is and has been for some time past much dissatisfaction with the administration of the bequest, and in particular the reforms intro duced by Lieutenant-Colonel Newmarch have roused the strongest opposition. The present recipients are not considered to be real muj tahids at all, and it is very doubtful whether a single one of them would be chosen if the Lucknow Shias had a voice in the matter. The former distributors (the recipients up to 1903) are said to have been men who would never have dreamt of keeping an anna for themselves. A fewmen of this type are said to be forthcoming in Karbala and Najaf at the present moment, but they are not amongst the allowance holders, and this fact lowers the present administration in the eyes of Shias. 5. As to the second point on which the Government of India desire the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor, public opinion in Luck now is unanimous in holding that the bequest was essentially a chari table one. The money, it is said, is for charity to poor pilgrims and the mujtahids are merely distributors. Without going into questions of literal interpretation (and the conference had not the text of the origi nal document before it) the Lucknow Shias ask what their king had to do with Persian mujtahids. His object, they say, was to help poor and deserving pilgrims from his own country. The words of the treaty— “ that His Majesty might thereby derive its benefits ” are held to streng then this view. The spiritual benefit to the King would be derived directly from charity to the poor, and not from intervention of mujtahids as such. The mujtahid may, if poor, himself be a beneficiary or he may be an agent of the distribution, but as offering prayers or performing ceremonies he would be superfluous. In short, public opinion in Lucknow demands nothing less than the devotion to charity of the whole of the income of the bequest. 6. There is moreover a general wish in Lucknow that some con trol over the administration of the bequest should be exercised. It was suggested that there should be a standing committee in Lucknow which should be consulted as to the selection and removal of allowance holders and on other questions of importance, such for instance as the proposal to establish a hospital for the benefit of Indian pilgrims. ML Lorime^s suggestion that he should himself visit Lucknow and consult with the heads of the Shia community vras very well received. Finally the meet ing requested the Commissioner of Lucknow to express to Government their thanks for the steps taken to protect the interests of the Indian Shias. 7. The interpretation of the intention of the bequest, which is favoured by the Shias of Lucknow, finds most convincing support in the passage in the original engagement in Persian executed by the King of Oudh, which is mentioned in the Government of India’s letter of No vember last. This document, as is remarked in that letter, does not appear to have been examined when the subject has previously been under discussion. If Colonel Jarrett, on whose report the previous orders of the Government of India were based, had seen this version, he could not, the Lieutenant Governor thinks, have failed to notice a clause which puts the intentions of the donor beyond reasonable doubt. The Lieutenant Governor has taken advice in the matter from Mr. B. Lindsay, I.C.S., who was recently Legal Bemembrancer to this Government and is himself an accomplished Persian scholar. The advice is to the effect that the written contract between the Governor General and the King of Oudh consists of two documents,—the original deed in Persian executed by the King (no. 1 of the photographs) and the bilingual document signed by the Governor General (no. 3 of the photographs). The first differs from the second in two important points. The words translated by Colonel Jarrett as ‘‘the supreme theologicaldoctors who are continuous residents near the holy shrines ” are written in the original deed as follows :—^*4 ^ , the ) (alif) between ; and ^ in d f )5 ^ being marked with a madd ( ~ thus I . The phrase should therefore read : mujhtahidan-i-mujawir-i-an astan, i.e. mujtahids who are mujawir of (i.e. continuously resident near) that shrine, viz. Najaf or Karbala mentioned above. This point is to be noted not only because it shows that Colonel Jarrett’s translation of the phrase is substantially correct, but also because it disproves a sugges tion which has been made that the word mujawir is used in the technical sense of “ domiciled pilgrim.” 8. Further, and this is the most important point, the original deed (no. 1) contains the following words not to be found in the bilingual document (no. 3) : “ ki musharun ilaihim az taraf-i-injanib binabar-i- kasb-i-sawab ba arbab-i-istihqaq taqsim mekardah bashand ” [“in order that the above-named mujtahids may distribute it on my behalf to the deserving for acquisition of (spiritual) reward”.] Here it is clearly laid down that the money is not to be paid to the mujtahids for their own benefit, but that they were intended to be merely the agents for the distribution of the King’s bounty, and were to divide the money among the deserving (arbab-i-istihqaq) with the object of obtaining a spiritual benefit to the King himself. The corre sponding clause in the bilingual document is ambiguous ; at the same time it is clear even here, that the King contemplated the earning of spiritual merit. It is hardly reasonable to suppose that the object could be attained by the bestowal of a large sum of money annually on persons like foreign mujtahids who are not, or ought not to be, in need of it. The discrepancy between the original and the bilingual counterpart is difficult to explain, but is probably due to negligence, a theory which derives some support from the fact that the translation into English was made without strict regard to the Persian contents. The transla tion is admittedly inaccurate and in one instance at least has been made after the interpolation of words not to be found in the Persian text. This difference however makes it necessary to determine which of the two documents should be taken to contain the authentic version of the agreement. In Mr. Lindsay’s opinion, which Sir John Hewett accepts, it can hardly be doubted that the original deed executed by the King of Oudh (no. 1) should prevail. It was the King who was making the loan, and it was for him to lay down the conditions about the manner of the payment of interest, and the object of that payment. 9 The conclusion then to be derived from the original text of the bequest is clear, that the mujtahids ought to distribute the whole money in charity upon deserving recipients ; and this was clearly understood in Turkish Arabia itself (where the mujtahids receiving the money were and still are called “ distributors ”) until the reforms instituted by Lieu tenant-Colonel Newmarch. These reforms, undertaken because the nominal distribution by one mujtahid at each centre had fallen into gross abuse, have substituted a distribution by the Resident to mujtahids for a distribution by mujtahids. To make any such agreement with the present recipients as is proposed by Mr. Lorimer, whereby they would be enabled to keep for their personal enjoyment the larger portion ofthis money, on condition of giving up the smaller portion to charity, would not only be to subsidize a body of men who do not appear to command the confidence of their co-religionists, but would also defeat the apparent intentions of the donor. What the treaty appears to have contemplated was a distribution by the mujtahids, and moreover by mujtahids who should be men of such position and character that they would administer the bequest properly. 10. Finally it appears to Sir John Hewett that in view of article 4 of the body of the deed of agreement between the King and the Company (page 157, vol. I, Aitchison, fourth edition) it is incumbent on the British Government to see that the King s expressed deshe ia carried out. This article, it is true, refers in the first instance to the Lucknow stipendiaries; but it may, in the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor, be held to indicate what the King desired should be the action of the British Government as regards all payments. His Honour is unable to support the suggestion of the Lucknow Conference^ that a committee should be established at Lucknow, or the tenth resolution of the All India Shia Conference held in December 1909, which is ambi guously worded but apparently advocates the intervention of a central standing waqf committee ; but he is of opinion that some measure of control by the British Government over the administration of the be quest is contemplated in the treaty. The resolutions passed by the last two sessions of the All India Shia Conference leave no doubt m his mind that any action taken by the Government to secure that leading mujtahids should, either personally or through an agent, dis tribute the whole income of the bequest to deserving recipients would meet with the fullest approval of the Indian Shia community at large.

McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Assistant Secretary’s letter No. 1074-G., of the 7th June 1911, on the subject of the Oudh Bequest.13 ’r''~-*TTT'* mmmm 2. I respectfully subnut that it is inexpedient to consult Saiyid Muham mad Kazim or Saiyid Muhammad Isma’il (Sadr), though they are the most important Mujtahids of the day at Najaf and Karbala respectively, about the administration of the Oudh Bequest. In January 1908 my predecessor Colonel Ramsay wrote to each of them offering him a share under the Bequest, and inviting him, if he felt unable to accept it himself, to suggest the names of three other qualified Mujtahids. Saiyid Muhammad Kazim replied declining either to accept the share or to propose names, while Saiyid Isma’il at first refused to send any written answer at all. At length, after the lapse of nearly a year, the latter was induced to send a short note to the Resident, in which he said that he could neither accept a share for himself, nor “ appoint ” any other person. Before this Saiyid Isma’il (Sadr) had twice refused to reply to letters from Colonel Newmarch, then Resident; and on the second occasion he was so discourteous as to return the Resident’s letter unopened. To quote from personal experience, in December 1909 I took the unusually conciliatory step of calling upon Saiyid Muhammad Kazim, at his house in Najaf, with reference to Oudh Bequest affairs. Our conversation remained vague and unsatisfactory, so I asked the Saiyid for a promise, which he gave, that he would let me have his views in writing later. In April 1911, however, on my reminding him by letter of his promise, he merely replied that he had nothing to add to what he had already told me. It seems clear that no real help is to be looked for from either of these two Mujtahids, and that in approaching them there is considerable danger of a rebuff. It is possible also that their advice, if obtained, might prove to be of small value ; and it might even be so irrelevant and absurd that we should be obliged to disregard it after having sought it. The case appears to be one in which the best result is likely to be attained through a conscientious con struction of the terms of the Will by the trustees themselves, viz., by the Government of India. 8. I venture to express my deferential concurrence in the opinion of the Government of the United Provinces that the Original Engagement with the King of Oudh should prevail over the bilingual copy of the Agreement. In the opinion of Persians in this country the wording of the bilingual cop y is hopelessly ungrammatical. The phrase “ Mujtahidan-i-mujawiran-i-Astan is as impossible in correct Persian as “ theological doctors residings at the Thres- * hold ” would be in England. This solecism has made it practically certain from the outset that there was some corruption of the text; and the original, now discovered,, shows how the corruption arose. The demonstrative pronoun “ an ” preceding “Astan” was mistaken by a careless or uneducated scribe, notwithstanding the Maddah above its Alif, for a plural inflexion suffixed to the participle “ mujawir ”, Nothing can be clearer than the meaning of the true text, at length restored : it is that given towards the end of the 7th paragraph and in the fourth, fifth and sixth lines of the 8th paragraph of the letter of the Govern ment of the United Provinces. The money is to be paid half to “resident Mujtahids” or to “ the resident Mujtahids: ” of Najaf, and half to those of Karbala, for distribution to “ deserving persons ”, and this distribution is to be made by the said Mujtahids on behalf of the King of Oudh for the benefit of the King’s soul. 4. There can now be no controversy regarding the facts that {a) the money must, under the will, be paid entirely to the resident ” Mujtahids of Karbala and Najaf ”, all or some of them ; and (6) that the direct payment of any part of the money to other persons, such as distressed Indians, w r ould be contrary to the terms of the w r ill. The only warrant for direct payment, as formerly practised, was the conjectural emendation “ Mujtahidan w r a mujawiran ” of the corrupt text, which last has now been finally exploded.14 5. A doubt remains as to wbetber payment should be made, according to tie will, “ to the Mujtahids(i e .,to all the Mujtahids) or only “ to Mujtahids (ie to some of the Mujtahids) resident at Najaf and Karbala. Personally I am inclined to think that the natural meaning of the Persian words is all the resident Muitahids’’ at either place; but here we encounter a serious practical difficulty. As has been well explained by one of my predecessors • felernal A., Se^mter 1003, No, 6180 (Colonel* NeWmaph) it IS impossible 6^11 (Pro. No. 70 ). to draw up a list of the Mu] tali ids or Karbala and Naiaf. Of a few individuals at each place it is possiole to’ say with certainty that they are Mujtahids : but the claims of the great majority of those who pretend to Ijtihad are doubtful, and the only test of their genuine- ness is a vague and divided popular opinion. The files of this Residency are full of inconclusive discussions as to whether such and such an individual is really a Mujtahid or not. Again there is the difficulty that among the un doubted Mujtahids there are some, including at the present time the doyen ot the faculty’ both at Najaf and at Karbala, who refuse to have anything to do with the Oudh Bequest, In practice it seems, therefore, that the word “ Mujtahid ’ must he treated as meaning “Mujtahids selected as such by the “representative ot the Govern ment of India, who are willing to ‘ undertake the distribution of the Oudh Bequest A limited construction, analogous to this, would have to be adopted in England in the ease of a Bequest to &lt;c the learned men of Oxford’ or ‘‘the clergy of London. 8 9 ’ 6. It might he interesting, hut it would probably be unprofitable, to enquire what the intentions of the King of Oudh, the testator, were. I know nothing of the personal character of the late Ghazi-udMfin Haidar; hut it seems safe to presume, from the very vagueness of the phraseology, which he was content to use, that he did not much care what became of the money after it had been made over to the supreme authorities of his Church. He left no injunctions as to caring for Indians or even for the poor. That he had bequeathed the money to holy men to deal with was perhaps all that was necessary, in his opinion, to ensure his own eternal welfare. 7. The sense of the expression “ deserving persons ” requires to he care fully studied. I venture to deprecate any reference of the question of what it means to the Mujtahid class of Najaf and Karbala, who are personally interested. They are almost exclusively Persians, and I feel sure that if the matter is left to them they will fail to do justice to Indian paupers and pilgrims. I would equally deprecate its reference to any Indian society or body of ‘ ITlama for the contrary reason that they would unduly favour Indians. It seerns to me, with all respect, that the case is one in which the execution of the will is most likely to be impartial if it is confided to a mixed lo *al committee of Persians and Indians working together under the supervision of the British Kesident at Baghdad, Most people will, I feel sure, agree that it is not necessary to be poor in order to be a a deserving person v under the Will. For example, if a Mujta hid of standing consents to give up much time to Bequest business such as the difficult and thankless task of weighing one. claim for relief against another, and in so doing to sacrifice a considerable part of his ordinary income, he himself should surely be treated as a “ deserving person” and as entitled to some re muneration from the Bequest And why should not scholarship, especially in sacred learning, itself be reckoned a foim of desert ? 8 I may be permitted, perhape, to criticise tbe attitude of some Indian Shi’ah gentlemen disclosed in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the letter from the Government of the United Provinces. They appear almost to ignore the word ing of the Will, which lays down merely that resident Mujtahids of Najaf and Karbala are to distribute the funds to deserving persons. Not a word is (f) See enclosure of Colonel Ramsay’s letter said in the Will about Charity to t!l0 No. 1053 (a) of 30 th October iuc9. poor or about preference to Indians, and (»)Pro No. 46 in General a., December 1910 , two of the weightiest Persian Mujtahids Nos. 46-60. ‘ at Najaf have already declared! in* 15 writing that Indians have no special claim to benefit by the Bequest. It is entirely clue to the influence of British residents at Baghdad that three of the present twenty allowances under the Bequest are held by Indian scholars. If the matter had been left to the popular voice at Najaf and Karbala—and it is the popular voice there that makes Mujtahids, both great and small—there would not now be a single Indian among the allowance holders. An Indian Mujtahid may be all very well at Lucknow; hut at Najaf or Karbala it is hardly an exaggeration to say he appears like a whipped dog in the presence of the arrogant and all-powerful Persian hierarchy I have myself seen one or two examples of this on my visits to Karbala and Najaf. The sentence, “ The present recipients are not considered to be real Mujtahids at all, and it is doubt ful whether a single one of them would he chosen if the Lucknow Shias had a voice in the matter ” reads strangely in this country. If the pretensions of the Lucknow Shi’ahs came to be known in the Holy Cities, the first question would be “ Who are these that they should make and unmake Mujtahids at Najaf and Karbala ?”; and some expression of doubt as to the existence of any genuine Indian Mujtahids in ‘Irak might not improbably follow. ^ As a matter of fact the present distributors are the Mujtahids of highest position whom my predecessors Colonel Newmarch and Colonel Ramsay could persuade to act as such, and neither of these officers spared pains to enlist the best possible men as distributors. The matter of selection was one to which they devoted the closest personal attention. If Mulla Muhammad Kazim (Khurasani) and Shaikh ‘Abdullah (Mazandarani) of Najaf are not genuine Mujtahids, there are none such in the world, except Saiyid Muhammad Kazim and Saiyid Isma’il (Sadr) who hare always refused to connect themselves with the Bequest. No new distributor has been appointed since my own arrival at Baghdad. Unfortunately experience has now shown that even the best available Mujtahids, unsupervised, cannot be trusted as distributors, 9 . Next comes the question of the part to he played by the Government of India and its representative at Baghdad in the management of this enor mous Bequest. The policy hitherto has been one of virtual non-intervention. Before Colonel Newmarch’s time there was one Mnj tabid distributor at Najaf and one at Karbala, and much of the money went to “undeserving persons ” in contravention of the Will. Since the changes introduced at Colonel Newmarch’s recommendation,* 'Pro. No. 70 iu External A., September 1903 , whidl I for 0116 have UO hesitation in Nos. 67 - 8 o. describing as reforms, inasmuch as they have awakened the public conscience,—there have been ten distributors at each place; but the practical result has been hardly better. The misfortune is that it is the Indian Government and their representa tives who are blamed for this state of mattters, a state which could evidently he remedied by intervention. It seems to me that the Government of India must, if they are to regard their own reputation, now come forward and insist, as the executors of the Will, on CQnditions precedent to appointment which will compel the distributors to act in accordance with the Will and disburse at least part of the money to fPro. No. 49 in General A., December 1910, Nos. “ deserving persons”. I have suggested 4G ' ( 0 a scheme! according to which this could he done, one which seems to me to he perfectly in accordance wuth the Will, and One w hich has been accepted by seven of the present nine distributors at Karbala. A majority at Najaf, aho, would probably have agreed to the scheme ; hut I last year thought it better to refer to the Government of India before discussing the matter with the distributors at that place. 10 . I beg now to re-submit the scheme in question to the Government of India for their favourable consideration. It is in essence this, that every present or future distributor should be required, as a condition of his remain ing or becoming a distributor, to disburse a proportion of the sum he receivesthrough a public committee to “deserving persons”. There would be a committee at Najaf and a committee at Karbala j and each committee would consist of the distributors themselves (or their nominees) and of an equal number of nominees of the British Besident at Baghdad, with the addition in either case of the British Vice-Consul at Karbala as President. This would ensure the proper distribution of a proportion of the funds, and the remainder the distributors would deal with according to their consciences. Some of them would divide a part or even the whole of the remainder to others: the rest would not. In any case the Government of India and their representatives would largely escape the reproach of maladministration, which is now levelled against them ; and, with the large sums which would be honestly distributed, a vast amount of good could be done. This scheme is a compromise, designed to safeguard all legitimate interests and to satisfy, to some extent, all claims. I had suggested that two-fifths of the whole of the funds shouM be distributed through the committees, but the amount might very well be raised to one-half; and there is no reason why, if the system worked well, the proportion distributed through the committees should not be gradually increas ed as new distributors were appointed from time to time. This would be a point for the consideration of successive Residents. I think that the repre sentatives of the Besident on the committee should, as “deserving persons’, receive a moderate remuneration out of the funds. Their posts would be no sinecure. 11. It is very important that the Besideut should have some control oyer the committees, and indeed he in a position to sway their decisions. Otherwise there is no doubt that much of the money will still be misappropriated, or at least wasted. Oriental philanthropists incline too much to doles to the poor, and the result is the propagation of poverty. Karbala is already a sink of Indian pauperism, and, if it once came to be known in India, that to be poor at Karbala or JNajaf meant to receive an allowance from a charitable committee, there would certainly be a great influx from India of the lowest and most undesir able classes. They would multiply here in misery, and the name of Indian would become even more of a byword than it already is. It must also be remembered that the descendants of British subjects in Turkey are treated as British subjects to all generations, and that the Ottoman Government is increasingly jealous of our firmly-maintained rights of extra territorial jurisdiction. There are thus serrous political objections to pauper immigration from India. 12. It would be the duty of the British Besident at Baghdad to guard against well-meaning pauperisation by counselling the restriction of mere doles within limits, and to induce the committees to work on broad and well- considered lines for the benefit of all poor Shi’ah Indian visitors to and residents in Mesopotamia. In general such are, without question, “ deserving persons 13. One important work would be the facilitation for Indians of the Shi’ah pilgrimages, which are at present carried out under conditions of the utmost hardship and degradation. I have several times referred to the excellent arrangements made by the Bohrah community for pilgrims of their own sect, and the Oudh Bequest committees might well follow in their steps by provid ing suitable hostels for ordinary Shi’ahs at the principal places, and by furnish ing guides to interpret for them, make their travelling arrangements, and protect them from the thousand and one rapacious harpies to whom they at present fall an easy prey. By means of a monthly sum of Bs. 200 which has been allotted to me by the provisional committee at Karbala, I have already been able to make some small arrangements of this sort at Kadhimain, Karbala, Najaf and Samarrah; and I have received grateful thanks and much hearty encouragement in regard to what has been done from Indian Shi’ah pilgrims of all classes. 1 even learn that some commendatory articles on the arrangements have appeared in the vernacular Indian press.— 3Z 14. Another useful enterprise would be to establish a school or schools in which the children of Indian Shi’ahs settled in the country could be educated and enabled to earn a living. At present the course of the best domiciled Indian families, nearly all Shiah, is a descending one from generation to generation ; and the sight is pathetic, not to say tragic. The first generation, now extinct, were rich noblemen,—Nawabs of Oudh or members of the Royal Family of Delhi; the second are gentlemen, moderately well off ; the third, owing to the progressive subdivision or termination of pensions and allowances, are poor people; and the fourth generation will he—in some cases already are ~ beggars, untrained to any profession or trade. Besides these there are • the still more numerous progeny of families poor from the beginning. Per mission to establish schools with technical branches could not, I think, be refused by the Turkish Government. 15. Yet another desideratum is.a good hospital at Karbala, which would also serve Najaf, and might alleviate much suffering among Persians as well as Indians. For its establishment an authorisation of the Porte would be required, and the doctor in charge must he in possession of the Constantinople diploma ; but these are not insuperable difficulties. 16. The fact is that there are almost no limits to the good work which might be undertaken for the benefit of undeniably “ deserving persons ” if the distribution of the Ondh Bequest were philanthropically and tactfully controlled. The sum—Rs. 10,000 a month—is so large as to make nearly anything possible, with good management. 17. I cannot refrain from reverting to the rather disappointing impression which the views of a representative committee of Lucknow Shi’ahs have made upon me. From the time of my arrival here I have not ceased to exercise influence, even undue influence, in the interests.of the Indians ; yet it appears that I am regarded in India as little better than an obstructionist. I have made the revolutionary proposal that the distribution of a large part of the funds by the Mujtahids should be subjected to Government control—a proposal of whose propriety in the eyes of Government I was doubtful—and the only qomment is that my plan is “ a step in the right direction”, but unsatisfactory and insufficient. The object of the Lucknow Shiahs is, apparently, to devote the whole of the funds to ** charity ”, non-Indian Sui’ahs being perhaps excluded from the benefits of the distribution. This very '* charity,” especially to Indians, is in my opinion one of the greatest dangers to be guarded against in the whole situation. General Tweedie, for tea years Political Resident at Baghdad, will I think pardon me if I make use of the following phrase in a private letter that he wrote me recently, in which, referring to distributions under the old system, lie says: “ But such a bounty has produced lamentable pauperism, and demoralisation in the Karbala and Najaf country ”. And, having been present in person throughout one long distribution by the committee at Karbala in the spring of 1910, I can bear personal testimony to the dangers. “ of a degrading charity ”, which are perhaps not inferior to the evils of embezzlement by the distributors. The only reliable safeguard against both inconveniences appears tonne to be a respectable committee working in the full light of publicity under the close surveillance of the British Political Resident at Baghdad. 3 8. My letter No. 312* of the 11th April 1910 (especially paragraph 7) * Pro. No. 49 in General A., December 1910, Nos. must, 1 fear, have failed to COJlvey my eo meaning if it appeared to the Govern ment of the United Provinces to “ imply the acceptance of two principles ...... firstly the distribution amongs a number of Mujtahids |of sums approxi mately equal, and secondly the repudiation on the , part of the British Gov ernment of. all responsibility for the use made by the recipients of this money Personally I am opposed to a system of equal grants to a fixed number of Mttjtahids. So also, I believe, was my immediate predecessor Colonel Ramsay. So also was a Mujtahid of Karbala who resigned his allowance under the Oudh 1.7Bequest at the end of 1904 remarking to the British Vice-Consul at Karbala: &lt;c A lion and a fly can not he placed on the same level together, and (it) is still more unjust to give the respective food of the one to the other. The lion requires a greater and better quantity^ of food than the fly.” In my opinion the number and respective amounts of the allowances should he vari able and should depend entirely on circumstances. From the whole tenor of my letter I thought it would appear that I was in favour of Government intervention for the purpose of securing the proper execution of the Bequest, and even that I considered it indispensable. The dismissal in certain circumstances of Shaikh Husain, which I suggested, would be an act of intervention. 19. With the utmost deference I would urge that the decision of this case should be expedited as much as possible. Pending a declaration of policy by the Government of India the funds of the provisional committee formed at my suggestion at Karbala have been accumulating for over a year; and the major portion, deposited in the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Baghdad, already amounts to £ T. 1,794. Some of the Mujtahids are growing impatient, and I have received a letter from one of them saying that when he subscribed to the committee funds he intended the money to be spent at once on some more worthy object, and did not contemplate its being locked away for an indefinite period. Some of the ignorant public possibly believe that the money in deposit has been embezzled, as has indeed been asserted, although the distributors receive monthly accounts of it. In a word there is the danger that a favour able opportunity may pass away if it is not now turned to account. 20. Last of all I would respectfully urge the Government of India to give full weight to my recommendations, in the soundness of which I am even more confident that I was a year ago, and which are founded on two visits to Najaf and Karbala and on personal intercourse with a number of the Mujtahids. The Oudh Bequest is a stream which is capable of vivifying thousands ; but, left unwatched and unguided, it will continue to stagnate in a morass of corruption and dishonesty..(^) Telegram PNo. S.—dated the 23rd January 1912.

I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter dated the 28th December from Syed Ahmad, whose views on the Oudh Bequest were explained in my letter No. 844, dated the 30th September 1907. 2. The possibility of improving the system, of distributing the Oudh Bequest money has been discussed with a very large number of people during the last three years, but I have met no one who defended the present system, or who could suggest any practical improvement. Everyone tells me that the money ought to be spent on charitable objects, and I believe that the really leading Mujtahids might be willing to support Syed Ahmad’s efforts as soon as they saw them bear some fruit. Unfortunately the Mujtahids are men of no experience : they have never seen what we should consider to be a decently managed charitable fund, and consequently they are unable to understand appeals in favour of a reasonable expenditure of the Oudh Bequest money. If there is to be improvement it must come from some place other than Nedjef or Karbala, and seeing that the money comes from Oudh I do not think any more suitable agent could be used than a leading Priest of Lucknow. 3. For these reasons I have written a reply to Syed Ahmad encouraging him in his efforts. A copy of this reply, as well as the original, is herewith enclosed for the information of the Government of India. Should it be consi dered free from objection I shall be obliged if it can be forwarded to Syed Ahmad as early as is convenient. 4. I earnestly hope that the Government of India will forward the letter. Should Syed Ahmad fail in the task that he proposes to take upon himself no harm will be done: but if experience proves him to be an honest and capable man he may be able to introduce a system which will be a blessing to thousands of poor and suffering people, and which will bring credit to the British Government. Dated the 28tk December 1908. From —Syed Ahmad Moin-ul-Olama Allamah-i-Hindi, Shamsul Olama Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, Deurhi Agha Meer, Lucknow, To—His Excellency the British Consul-General of Baghdad. Mujtahid, Chief High son of Priest, Most respectfully I beg to lay the following lines for your kind and favourable consideration. 1. When I paid my respects to you in the Baghdad Consul House last time, on the last day of September 1907, I had a talk with you about the Wasika of Nawab Mobarak Mahal, in which I expressed my opinion that it was not fairly distributed. I then introduced Your Excellency with a pro posal for the establishment of a hospital for the poor which was approved by Your Excellency. Unfortunately I, as desired by Your Excellency, could not stay there on account of some domestic affairs which urgently demanded my presence at Lucknow. Ever since that time I was thinking that Your Excel lency will kindly inform me about it through the Commissioner of Lucknow or perhaps consult me about the matter. I still firmly hold the opinion mentioned above, for my experience during my stay at Karbala urges me on to state plainly that there is an urgent need of a hospital for the poor British subjects. It will be far better to spend it for the Indians living there than to spend it for the foreigners according to the Will of the donor. It is possible that according to the donor’s Will the money may be handed over to the Mojawir Mujtahid to establish a regular hospital for the good of the Government subjects, I 431 Fin. D,2 mmmmmmmmmrnm I am also ready to take the responsibility of the work on myself if it may please Your Excellency to promise me to help, in which case I shall pay my respects to Your Excellency at Baghdad. Dated the 13th February 1909. From— Lieutenant-Colonel J. Ramsay, C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad, To— Syed Ahmad Moin-ul-Olama Allamah-i-Hindi, Mujtahid, son of Shamsul Olama Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, Chief High Priest, Deurhi Agha Meer, Lucknow. I was pleased to receive your letter of the 28th December regarding the Oudh Bequest money. When we discussed this matter in September 1907, we seemed to have many ideas in common. I should, therefore, be ready to help you to introduce a more satisfactory system of expending this Trust money. It is important, however, that you should realise that the task you propose is no easy one, and can only be completed after much patient effort. I will tell you a few of the difficulties :— (1) The Oudh Bequest money is divided into twenty shares, and no share is at the present moment vacant. Money could only be placed at your disposal by me when a share falls vacant. If your scheme was once started subscrip tions might be obtainable from the other recipients, but you would have much opposition at first. (2) I can give the money to whom I please, provided that the recipient is both a Mujtahid and a resident of Karbala or Nedjef. I have no reason to think that you would have any difficulty in proving to me that you are a Mujtahid, but before you are eligible for a share of the money, you must be come a resident (Mujawar) of Karbala or Nedjef. (3) The Resident cannot pretend to control the money once he has paid it to a Mujtahid resident at Karbala or Nedjef. The resident is merely the Executor of a Will, and according to the Will his responsibility ends, and the Mujtahid’s responsibility begins, when the latter receives the money._ ptili there is nothing in the Will to prevent the Resident selecting as recipients resident Mujtahids whose views are in sympathy with his own. (4) You will have to face great local opposition from those who are in terested in the continuance of the present system. (5) The Turkish authorities may, but are not likely to, make difficulties about allowing a foreign hospital. They will almost certainly demand tha the Medical Officers and compounders should obtain diplomas from Constanti nople. (6) You know the feeling that exists at Karbala and Nedjef towards those who are not Moslems. If the people think that you rely on the Resident for support your local difficulties will be increased, and the intrigues agains you will gain strength. # . (7) Your life will be made a burden to you, at any rate for a time, by im portunate but undeserving beggars. If you are prepared to make a sustained effort with a view to making t e money of the Oudh Bequest a really useful charitable fund, I am prepared to help you as far as I reasonably can do so. The only definite promise that I can make you is that I will nominate you as the recipient of the first share that falls vacant after you are qualified to become a recipient. If experience proved that your efforts were likely to meet with success, it might be possible to increase your share of the Uudq I have thought it right to describe some of the difficulties that you will have to overcome because it would be disappointing to you (and to ™e) to fl d your task harder than you anticipate. It is far from my wish to ^courage you, for I hope you will come determined to surmount all obstacles. You ha3 a great opportunity of being a benefactor to your co-religionists. I am by no means sure that some of the more powerful men in Nedjef and Karbala will not have some sympathy for your views : and if you can organise an influential committee to manage the money you will have made a good start.

In reply to your letter No. 153, dated the 13th February 1909, on the sub ject of the Oudh Bequest, I am directed to inform you that the Govern ment of India see no objection to the terms of the letter addressed by you to Syed Ahmad of Lucknow, and the original has accordingly been forwarded to the addressee, as desired.

In continuation of the correspondence ending with your letter No. 142- G., dated the 14th January 1909, I have the honour to forward a memorial signed by a large number of the Indian residents of Karbala and Nedjef, com plaining of the present system of distributing the Oudh Bequest. 2. In the first paragraph of the memorial the petitioners raise the old question as to whether the money should, according to the terms of the Will, be paid to the Mujtahids alone, or to the Mujtahids and Mujawars. This question was discussed at great length in the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 1074-1., dated the 7th March 1891, and decided in favour of the interpretation, Mujtahids only. I, therefore, asked the Vice-Consul at Karbala to call upon the petitioners to state the source from which they had made their quotation. He informs me that the memorial was drawn up in India by Lawyers acting under the instructions of a man described as Majtahid Radhi-ud-Din of Murshidabad. 3. The succeeding paragraphs of the memorial, up to paragraph 12, amount to nothing more than complaints against the Mujtahids, over whom we have no control. The money is made over to them unconditionally in ac cordance with the Will. 4. Paragraph 13 of the memorial suggests as a remedy that a Committee of three Mujtahids should be appointed to properly manage the Bequest money. The suggestion no doubt seems a very simple one to the Indian Lawyers who drafted it, but it cannot be carried out in Turkish Arabia, because three suitable Mujtahids are not forthcoming. I directed the Vice- Consul to see the chief petitioners and to ask them to suggest the names of the three Mujtahids whom they would like to sit on their proposed Committee, and they replied that the Mujtahids should be chosen by the Government.

AjJf ^\ax*a ^6 jUijb •— JijLc ot^jLso OAilyx sIaoIj religious leaders, and in compliance with some subsequent interpretation of the wording of the agreement noted in the margin, the old arrangement has been set aside, and the amount intended to be distributed is now paid to the Mujtahids (High Priests) only in the shape of monthly salaries. This change has proved ruinous to the poor Arabs and Persians, and more so to the Indian residents who now get little or nothing out of that charitable fund. The humble memorialists beg leave to quote in the margin the words of the said Agree ment, article 5, paragraph 3, relating to the allowance of Mobarak Mahal with a fervent hope that Your Excellency will be graciously pleased to recon sider the meanings of the words in question, and to restore the old arrange ment of distributing the sum among the poor people, for the reasons, and under the restrictions stated by the memorialists in the following para graphs :— (1) The “ Sharai-ul-islam,” and other books of Shia religion, noted in the _ margin, say that all things intended for Sharahi Lama, Musalik Jawahir-ul-Kalam, i „ • + „ + 4 .; i Sbarahi Kabir, Hadaiq, Mufatihusharai, Sarair, Charity, obligatory Or Optional, Should gO irshad, Miftah-ui-kirameh, Wasaii, Beharuiunwar. to the learned men, not to be appropri ated by them for their own use, but to be given over to persons whom they find deserving of charity, under the condi tions laid down by the religious law. This is a rule sanctioned by reason and observed everywhere in the world. (2) It was for this same reason that large sums of money amounting to thousands of Qirans and Tumans, were sent from Persia to the learned men of Iraq (e.g., Mirza Muhammad Husan, and his preceptor, Shaikh Murtaza, etc.), who distributed it entirely among the deserving people, knowing that it was unlawful to reserve any part of the sum for their own use. (3) In Lucknow, too, three lakhs of rupees were annually made over from the royal Treasury to the late Sultan-ul-ulma, Syed Muhammad, and distributed among thousands of the deserving poor. The Sultan-ul-ulma never appropriated it for his own use. (4) The learned men of Kerbala and Nedjef, who are acknowledged as the greatest Mujtahids by the people of Iraq, Persia and India (for example, Haji Mirza Ismail Aqai Sadr at Kerbala and Shaikh Taha, etc., at Nedjef) declined to accept the money in question, in the form of pergonal salaries, although offered by the British Consul-General of Baghdad. They knew that it was intended for the poor only. (5) On the same principle it is provided in article 5 of the agreement that one-half of the sum should be set aside for Nedjef and the other half for Kerbala and should always be remitted on behalf of the King to the Mujtahids and Mojawirs of the shrines. The remittances being intended for charitable purposes, the Mujtahids are not entitled to receive the sum in the form of their regular salaries. (6) In article 5 of the Agreement in connection with the servants of Sar- faraz Mahal, it is stated that the monthly allowance of any of her servants dying without an heir shall be added to the money dedicated to Nedjef and Kerbala j jiS) » zy These words imply that Mobarak Mahal’s money also is intended to be distributed among the poor, and not to be paid to Mujtahids in the form of personal salaries as is done under the present arrangement. (7) After the death of Mobarak Mahal, His Majesty, Wajid Ali Shah, King of Oudh, at the request of the British Resident of Baghdad, nominated the sons of the preceptor of his Mujtahids, i.e., Mir Syad Ali Tabatabai at Nedjef, and Hujjut-ul Islam, Mirza Ali Naqi Tabatabai at Kerbala, for the disposal of the money, These two learned men, Under the provisions of thereligious law, spent the money on charitable items, such as burial of the dead, stipends of student, repairs of mosques, subsistence allowances of the poor, etc. The major portion of the sum always fell to the shares of the Indian residents there who had been reduced to straitened circumstances. (8) This practice of utilising the money in this way continued for about sixty years at Nedjef, Kerbala and Kazmain, and hundreds of Muhammadans of various tribes—natives of Arabia, Persia and India were benefited by it, and were all along sincerely thankful and loyally attached to the British Gov ernment. It is not desirable on the part of the benign Government to win over the hearts of a few Mujtahids ignoring the interest of so many poor people. (9) It is not a correct impression that the people of Iraq being the fol lowers of the Mujtahids will be gratified to see their religious leaders drawing monthly salaries under the present arrangement, and be more loyally attached to the British Government. They are rather dissatisfied with the present arrangement, finding their own monthly allowances stopped; and have been disappointed of the favours they had been so long receiving from the Govern ment. (10) It is laid down in the said Agreement that the money should always be sent to the Mujtahids and Mujawirs of Nedjef and Kerbala, and the word Mojawirs as explained in the Dictionaries—Qamus, Sehah, Majma-ul-behar, Misbah-i-munir, Majma-ul-behrain, Muntahul-Arab, means neighbours, and in this very sense it is applied to the people residing near and about the holy shrines. This also goes to prove that the Bequest Fund in question is not in tended only for the salaries of the Mujtahids but also for the help of Your Excellency’s memorialists. (11) The old practice of distributing the amount among the poor was ap proved of and allowed to continue unaltered by twelve successive Agents to the Governor-General, viz., Colonel Rawlinson, Colonel Campbell, Colonel Herbert, Colonel Nixon, Colonel Miles, T. C. Plowden, Major Robertson, Colonel Tweedie, Dr, Bowman, Colonel Talbot, Colonel Mockler and Colone- Lock. (12) Before the new arrangement the work of distribution was entrusted to the Mujtahids of Nedjef and Kerbala, and when the Indian distributor of the said fund removed his head office to Kazmain the distribution was partly done at Kazmain and partly at Kerbala by an Indian distributor under Mu j tabid. The following were the successive Arab Mujtahids Mir by ad Ali Tabatabai and his nephew and son-in-law Syed Muhammad Tabatabai m Nedjef; Hujjut-ul-Islam Mirza Ali Naqi, his brother Mirza Abul Quasim, and his two sons, Mir Syad Ali and Syad Baqer in Kerbala The Indian distributors were Maulvi Mirza Zaki Husain, Mir Ali Ausat, Maulvi Gufsnan Ali, Nawab Hyder Ali Khan, Maulvi Nawab Mirza, the same Nawab Hyder Ali Khan, Muhammad Taqi Khan and Nawab Ibrahim Khan m Kerbala; Nawab Ahmed Agha, Mir Mehdi Husan, Nawab Mohammed Hossam Khan and Nawab Agha Muhammad in Kazmain. After these Mujtahids and dis tributors the new arrangement was proposed and brought into effect. (13) To put a stop to all sorts of complaints the best and safest course is to appoint three reliable Mujtahids, an Arab, an Indian and a Persian, each on R300 a month. They will carry on the work of distribution m consulta tion with one another. When they differ on any point, the point must be settled by the majority. They will keep a regular account of the money dis tributed and a register of the recipients; a file of receipts, etc. Ail com plaints made in writing will be dealt with in a formal way. _ They will have a regular office with all necessary records. During the lifetime of the King of Oudh, distributors were nominated by the King himself, but now these appointments are at the disposal of the British Government. (14) The charitable funds of a country are, as enjoined by religious laws, to be distributed among the people of that country wherever they may happen to be, and accordingly the natives of India residing m these placesare the proper people to be benefited by the funds. Formerly the number of these Indian residents was very limited and so the benefits of the funds were extended to other people also, that is, to the Arabs and Persians. As this practice has been in vogue for about 60 years, it would be undesirable to put a stop to it at once, and thereby create discontent among the foreign people, the Arabs and Persians who are not the subjects of the British Government; for the present, the money in question may be equally distributed among all the three classes of the people.

No. 1053, dated Baghdad, the 20th October 1909. From— Lieutenant-Colonel J. Ramsay, C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad, To—S. H. Butleu, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India In continuation of my letter No. 980,* dated the 22nd September 1909, ** 1 il J Mujtahids of Nedjef and Karbala to my Memorandum of the 20th Septem ber regarding the Oudh Bequest. I think that the Memorandum has been more kindly received than might have been expected. Karbala and Ned jet are infested with a crowd of religious students, who dominate the Mujtahids and who are firmly determined to get as much as possible for themselves out of all charitable funds. Lately they have been particularly active and conse quently the recipients had to consider how their replies would be viewed by the students. The students have sent me largely signed petitions through some of their number and through the Persian Consul-General begging me to have a certain sum set aside from the share of each recipient for the exclu sive use of the students. I have replied that the recipients can please them selves, but tha t such influence as I may possess will be exercised on behalf of the really distressed, •rather than on behalf of those who are strong enough to get all they deserve. The Mujtahids live in constant dread of the students and will probably welcome any sign of moral support against them. 2. There is no doubt that it is very difficult to find a suitable recipient for each of the ten shares at Karbala and Nedjef- It would enormously increase the influence of the Resident and at the same time decrease his difficulties if it were realised that he had the power to give more than one share to one man : he would then ensure more consideration for Indians and he could recognise the position of the really leading men by giving them two or more shares. Should occasion arise I think that the Resident should exercise this power, unless of course he receives orders to the contrary from the Government of India. o ir o .IP A .Kx iSxm &lt; -j (Signatures an Vernacular.)

I have the honour to forward a brief abstract of the replies received from theNote of the replies received from the recipient Mujtahids to Colonel Ramsay's “ Short Memorandum on the Oudh Bequest,' dated 20th September 1909. Replies from Nedjef. Sheikh Muhammad Kadhim El Khorasani: The Leading man in Nedjef. Says that it is not the duty of the Government to indicate the particular form df charity on which the money should be spent. The money is certainly meant to be spent on charity, but among Shiahs such money can be spent on the charities suggested in the memorandum, on maintaining or aiding in the creation of Mujtahids, and alsp on maintaining the'families of Mujtahids who are without support. This is the reason that some of the recipients spend their shares on their families : they do not look upon the money as their own personal property. If the recipient thinks fit he can spend the whole sum available on one form of charity only. Indians by reason of their being Indians have no better claim on the money than have other Shiahs in need of assistance. The Government should be careful in selecting recipients and its duty is then completed. Recipients are free to spend the money as they think fifi they are responsible to God alone and they could not possibly submit to any kind of superintendence over their distribution. Sheikh Abdulla El Mazandarani: A well recognised Mujtahid. Says that the money should be spent on charity, but that the Mujtahid is absolute judge of how he will spend his money. Asks what is meant by the expression “ the present system does not give satisfaction to any class of Shiahs and says that the will does not direct that payments are to be made to all classes of Shiahs- A Mujtahid has a perfect right to spend his share on himself and his family if he likes. It is also understood that the Mujtahid should help destitute people of all kinds, and that he should consider these as haying the first claim on him. Indians have no better claims than others. Haji Raza Shustari receives and distributes all monies on his account: he is an exceedingly good and trustworthy man, but he will only continue to receive a share of the Oudh Bequest on the clear understanding that no conditions are attached to its acceptance. Seyed Muhammad Kadhim is not a recipient but is a man of very great influence. Says the Consul-General’s views are quite correct, the money should be distributed among the poor by the Mujtahids. In the time of beyed Murtaza he used to distribute all to the poor. The same system should be introduced, by which the money shall be distributed through a Committee ot merchants. It is possible that the spending of the money on a work of public charity is against the terms of the will, but he cannot express an opinion on this point as he is not well posted in regard to the details of the particular case. . Svy e d Kalbi Mehdi is the only Indian recipient at Nedjef. —Says he entirely agrees with the memorandum and thinks that others will do the same. Has done all in his power to help the poor Indians, pilgrims and others, whom no one cares to help. If any Committee is appointed it should be clearly understood that it must help poor Indians, otherwise he would not care to have any concern with it. This is his opinion, but the order of the Consul-General will be obeyed. Sheikh Mehdi, son of Sheikh Assadallah. —Says he agrees with the Con sul-General : that it does not matter to him whether he pays his charities through a Committee or direct. He is quite ready to fbllow the Consul- General s suggestion in regard to any sum that may be named. Sheikh Hassan Joivaheri. Says he likes and approves the memorandum 1S t r 0S n anxi 1 °' s t0 do , what he can to help the poor. He will pay any sum Consul General 1 ^ eDera ma * v na ™ e to tdle Committee nominated by theMuhammad Jafar Bahr-ul-Ulum.—$ays that he has always spent his share on the poor, his relations and others. Agrees with the Consul-General s opinion and asks that he be told what he should do. Abdul Hassan, son of Sheikh Says no one looks upon the Oudh Bequest as his personal property, but all distribute it after keeping what is needed for their own requirements. Tries to spend his money on charities and is willing to send monthly lists if the Consul-General would like this. If the Consul-General thinks that the money should be spent on some other object he has no objection provided the money is spent on some form of charity. ' Sheikh Fathulla, Shariat ul Ispahani.—Szys the Mujtahids do not think the money is their own and would not spend it on themselves, even if told to do so by the Consul-General: further the population of Nedjef and Karbala are beggars who are accustomed to eat what they do not earn and they would make it impossible for a Mujtahid not to give- The students come f-f 0 ™ many countries and have no money, it is right and proper that they should be helped. It is impossible to help all the deserving cases and those who are not helped complain. Some persons have obtained Ijazas ” (certificates of , fitness) as Mujtahids simply for the purpose of getting a share i n the Oudh Bequest, they have no students, they are known to no one, and such men are better off for having a share. The Consul-General should be able to find out all about these people. If there are any points which are not clear he will expect to hear again from the Consul-General. (No replies from Syed Abu Turab Khumsari and Akund Mulla Muham mad Ali Khorasani.) ’Replies from Karbala. Seyed Muhammad Bakir: who used to be the sole Recipient. Says that he agrees that the present arrangement is most unsatisfactory. The old sys tem which he always advocated should be reintroduced. Under this {a) allowances were given to the Mujtahids, proportionate to their respective positions : (b) a certain sum was kept for Indians : w) a certain sum was put aside for public works of charity, such as cleaning the canal which brings drinking water, and also for distribution to the sick and needy : {d) a certain sum was set aside for students., Seyeds and others. Con siders the Consul-General’s efforts are opportune and promises to assist them to the best of his ability with his sympathy and co-operation. Sheikh Muhammad Hussein el Mazandarani—Snys (in rather ambiguous terms) that the Mujtahids distribute to the poor and would accept shares on no other terms. It is a great pity that owing to the participation of un worthy individuals as Mujtahids the reputation of the Mujtahids has been diminished. There is no doubt that the Consul-General has the right to change the system of distribution. He formerly used to submit^ accounts but was asked by Colonel Newmarch not to do so : he is now willing to follow advice in the matter of distribution. The money available is not sufficient for a hospital. Distribution through a Committee is better, but honest and practical men are not to be found. Admires the Resident s honest admission that it is he who has deprived the destitute. The Resident is certainly responsible for selecting the recipients and had he selected better men the poor would have benefitted and a slur would not have been cast upon the Mujtahids. Is prepared to give a detailed account of malpractices committed by some of the recipients. Seyed Kalbi Bakir Hindi: 'One of the two Indian recipients at Kar bala. —Says he thinks the suggestions contained in the memorandum should be acted upon as the best means of putting an end to a scandal. Pays what he can to the residents and pilgrims, but has been forced to pay some of his share to Persians. Moulvi Seyed Murtaza Hussein: The second Indian recipient at Kar bala. —Says he has always paid his charities through a Committee and has lists of his payments : men and women are paid on alternate days.

For these reasons he only gives o Indians and consequently the Persian students dislike him. About wo months ago the Persian students tried to make him give Rs. 15 U a montn, and when he declined on the ground that he ought to give his money to Indians he received a threatening message that he would be got into trouble with tne Turkish authorities if he did not pay. If the other Mujtahids agree to distribute through a Committee he too will accept it, otherwise he will con tinue his present system. Muhammad Uadi el Isfahani.—^* he has distributed his share through a merchant whose accounts are open to inspection. Is ready to join with t e other Muitahids in carrying out the Resident’s suggestions because he thinks the procedure laid down in the memorandum meets the circumstances o± the case It is impossible to satisfy the beggars in this country and complaints therefore cannot be avoided. Seyed Hussein Qumi .—Says he will fulfil his duties by spending a pro portionate amount of the sum received by him in charity. Seyed Ali Says he spends Rs. 200 a month or more on stu dents and the poor, the balance he spends on his family and himself. He would not spend anything on himself if he could help it. If the Resident objects he will follow any procedure that is laid down. The knowledge that it is impossible to shut the mouths of evil speakers is as old as Moses- Seyed Hashim Kazvani: Through his son .—Says the support of Mrijfri- hids is a form of charity, in spite of this he gives between half and three-filths of his share to Ulemas, students and the poor. He thinks that the Resident s memorandum is inconsistent with -former communications and asks that he may be furnished with a copy of the will. Says he is ill and too sick to write himself.

British Residency and Consulate General, Baghdad, 20th October, 1909. &lt; 'Extract from the Summary of events in Turkish dray during December 1909 and January 1910. ****** ****** VII. —British Interests and Cases. 1 The vacancy in one of the allowances paid under the Oudh Bequest (see Summary, November 1909, II, 4) has caused a great commotion. Be tween the 29th November and the 26th January I received, m connection with * with a very few exceptions these were aii in it, no less than 209 communications, Persian or Arabic. viz., 10 telegrams and 32 letters from Mujtahids, 4 telegrams and 136 letters from other individuals, 5 letters from Societies, and 22 Mazabatas or round-robins : besides these I had, of course, visits from interested persons. The excitement is now gradually settling down, and I intend to let it subside altogether before making any decided move. There is not, in my opinion, any danger of actual disturbances, unless f Prices at Karbala, as elsewhere in the province, from starvingt Persian Students and the are very high this year. political societies in which they are enrolled; but the general dissatisfaction with existing arrangements, and even 431 p, D, gamm 10 more with some of the present holders of allowances personally, is more wide spread and deep-seated than I had imagined. In December I visted Kar bala, Najaf and Hillah, and this gave me an opportunity of acquiring some first-hand knowledge on the subject. At Karbala, as it appeared undesirable to let the proceeds of the vacant share accumulate, I made the balance in hand over to four of the most respectable among the Mujtahids, and they distributed it in charity. I hear that this arrangement was highly approved of by every one except the heirs of the deceased Mujtahid, who are however unfit persons to succeed him. At Najaf I had an interview with Saiyid Kazim (Tabatabayi), who divides with Saiyid Muhammad Ismail (Sadr) of Karbala the honour of being the most distinguished Mujtahid of the present day in ’Iraq. Both of these men have themselves declined to accept allow ances under the Oudh Bequest; and their advice on the subject of the Bequests, if it can be obtained, should be the more disinterested and valuable. Saiyid Kazim promised that he would, after reflection, furnish me with some remarks in writing; but he has not yet done so. At Hillah, in a private assembly, I was rudely attacked on the subject of the Oudh Bequest, eke., by one of the principal Shi’ah ecclesiastics of the town, who roundly implied that the present state of affairs was the height of mis management. My host apologised to me for the incident, but I welcomed it as a useful illustration of outside feeling. Shi’ah opinion is unanimous in condemning the present beneficiaries, who, with a few honourable exceptions, spend the grants entirely upon themselves and their relations. The fact that the will of Ghazi-ud-Din Haidar is unconditional in its terms is not ad mitted as a valid argument, so far as I can ascertain, by any non-recipient; and most of the recipients themselves seem to think that the funds are, inferentially, a charitable trust. They consequentlv take refuge in pretences of alms secretly dispensed. It ^ was Colonel Ramsay’s aim to induce the recipients to make some concessions of their own free will to the universal sentiment, and I hope eventually to carry his policy to a successful issue. I will report to the Government of India when I feel that I have thoroughly mastered the situation. * * # # # ^ No. 484-G., dated Fort William, the 8th March 1910. Endorsed by Foreign Department.

But it was not to be expected that the modified arrange ments introduced in 1903 should be per/fect in every respect; and I gather from both the letters of the Government of India quoted above that those arrangements need not be regarded as final or unalterable. 4. The views of my immediate predecessor, Colonel Ramsay, appear to t Pro. No. 214 in Secret E., April 1908, Nos- SOUie extent from Ms letter No. 844, f of views, so far as they are known to me from that letter and from a conversa tion which I had with him at Basrah, I am in agreement. I consider in fact that some alteration of the actual system has now become expedient. It is the case that the Shi’ah community, both here and in India, hold that a majority of the present beneficiaries under the Bequest are not clisposing as they ought to dispose of the large sums placed at their command. Whether the Mujtahids in question can be compelled to disburse part or the whole of the money in charity, or in any particular way, is a question, however, that does not now fall to be discussed; for thb latest position is that, while Shi’ah opinion gpnerally continues to demand a change of conduct on their part, a large majority of the allowance holders at Karbala are now happily dis posed to make one. 5. Seven Mujtahids of Karbala, holders of allowances, have voluntarily t The wording of the agreement is joint, but the “4 delivered to me ttie Mujtahids have signed on separate identical copies. |agreement Ot which a translation and . • , . ” V-y-LJ.

The ninth only, Shaikh Husain (Mazanda- ram), who is not distinguished above his fellows except by greater turbulence and avarice, has refused to follow the example set by them; and the Govern ment of India will observe that his refusal is a sufficient proof, if one were required, of the others having acted spontaneously.

Seven duplicate originals have beenbids in thinking that the number of the allowance holders at Karbala should not be determinate. 8. As the proposed Charitable Committee arrangements, though they appear to me to require the sanction of the Government of India, are of great importance and might be prejudiced by delay, I have allowed them, but on y in so far as the seven signatories at Karbala are concerned, to come into provisional operation. I trust that, in view of the special circumstances. Government will approve of my action, especially as I have tried to make it clear that I moved in the matter as a collaborator with the Mujtanids, and not independently as Resident. Should Government consider the arrange ments unsuitable, they can be terminated at once and without dimculty. 9. The attitude of Saiyid Husain {Qumi), though doubtful, is not un favourable. At the end of March, though he did not sign an agreement, he handed in two-fifths of what he received on account of that month for distri bution by the Committee. I believe _ that, if the scheme is approved by Government, he will at once throw in his lot with the majority of his brethren. 10. It remains to consider what should be done in regard to the allowance of the ninth Mujtahid, Shaikh Husain (Mazandarani). I have invited him more than once to visit me for the purpose of discussing the complaints against himself and the others, but he alone of them all has refused to do so. I am informed that Sheikh Husain is a man of unsatisfactory character, and that he keeps truculent individuals in his employment who terrorise people; and I fear that it is partly the possession of Rs. 500 a month which enables him to conduct himself as he does. Two deserving cases of destitution which were recommended to his care by Colonel Ramsay when he gave him his share under the Bequest were totally neglected by him after the first. I understand that the Resident has power* to confer and withdraw shares, for sufficient cause, without re- * Pro. No. 83 in External a, September 1903, f erence to Government; and in my No8,67 86, humble opinion the preservation of this power is essential, for several reasons; but in the present case, which is some what exceptional, it will probably be as well that I should inform Government of my intentions before putting them into execution. I propose, then, again to request Shaikh Husain to meet me for a discussion of Oudh Bequest affairs; and thereafter, if he refuses to meet me, or if at our meeting he declines to give proofs of public spirit and good character by adhering to the “ Two-Fifths Agreement ” accepted by his brethern, to inform him that his allowance is withdrawn, I shall deal with him patiently and not withdraw his allowance unless in the last resort, for it is very desirable that the general change which is proposed should be effected without any disagreeable accom paniment. But it is impossible that Shaikh Husain should be allowed to persist in his refusals to meet the Resident, or, having met him, to remain outside the system approved by his fellows; for such refusals, besides being unreasonable on the part of a beneficiary towards an ex officio trustee, are lowering to the dignity of this Residency; and successful contumacy on the Shaikh’s part may not only affect progress towards reform at Najaf, where also a new spirit is evident, but may even induce one or more of the Karbala signatories to repent of their agreement. 11. I propose that the share left vacant by the death of Saiyid Muham mad Hashim (Qazvini) should be distributed, not necessarily in equal pro portions, among Karbala allowance holders who adhere to the Two-Fifths Agreement. Most of those who have signed the agreement have thereby pledged themselves to part with much more than they have been accustomed to give away in the past; and the distribution of the vacant share among some of them would mitigate, though in part only, the change in their circum stances. If Shaikh Husain’s share should subsequently be withdrawn from him, it might be similarly dealt with; or it might be conferred on some new and deserving Mujtahid who would be willing to accept the Two-Fifths Agreement. This point might, I think, be left to my discretion. 12. I have promised to meet the Mujtahids again at Karbala early^ in June; and, if Government approve of the proposals contained in the precedingparagraphs, it would be convenient if I could be informed of the fact by tele gram in time for my visit, as a second journey to Karbala in very hot weather would then not be required. 13. I should mention that the Saiyid Ahmad referred to in Colonel Ramsay’s letter No. 153* of the 13th * Pro. No. 10 m Secret q., Apni 1909 , Nos. 10 - 13 . February 1909, was present throughout the recent proceedings at Karbala, and I believe that the turn which matters have now taken is regarded by him as satisfactory. That he did not strongly press his claims to succeed—conditionally upon his giving proof of Ijtihad— to the vacant share of the Qazvini was due, I think, to his perceiving that the appointment of another Indian at Karbala, where two already hold Oudh Bequest allowances, might compromise those public interests which he is amqious to serve. The extreme jealousy of Persian Mujtahids towards Indians belonging to the theological class is one of the numerous difficulties by which the administration of the Oudh Bequest is attended. Saiyid Ahmad is an able and ambitious man, but his ambitions appear to be such as, if rightly guided, may serve the public interests. 14. I take this opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of Resolution No. 10 of the All India Shi’ah Conference held in December 1909, which was forwarded to me under Foreign Department Endorsement No. 484-G., dated 8th March 1910. As I am not aware of any other medium through which information can be conveyed to the members of that Conference, pro bably since dissolved, I respectfully suggest that the Government of India should refer their leaders to Saiyid Ahmad, who has lately returned to Luck now and who will be able to explain to them reasons that make it undesirable to attract too much attention to the proceedings here at the present juncture, particularly the risk of alarming the Persian Muj tabid community a Karbala and Najaf and so making them intractable. The co-operation of the Con ference and other responsible associations of Indian Shi’ahs is likely to be valuable to the British Resident at Baghdad, and I should therefore be glad if I could be placed at an early date in official communication with any such that advise, or exercise control, in regard to the management of Waqf pro perty of funds for assisting pilgrims in this country. Private trustees having similar functions could also give useful assistance. A great deal of good can probably be done here, especially in the way of ameliorating the lot of pil grims, but careful /investigation of the facts is an indispensable preliminary, and much patience and discretion will be required. If I were allowed to visit India during the sitting of the next All India Shi’ah Conference and consult the leaders of that body, the results might be beneficial; but at the present stage any definite proposal of the sort would be premature. What is now required is a list of responsible Shi’ah associations and trustees in India, with a statement of the interests in Turkish ’Iraq controlled by each.

Dated Lucknow, the 6th May 1910. From Syed Ahmad, High Phiest, Son oe late Syed Mohammad Ibrahim, the Shamsul-Ulama, Chiel High Priest, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., E.C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Most humbly and respectfully, I beg to request the favour of your kindly putting forth my this humble petition to the notice of the Government and favour me with a reply.I. In the year 1907, I went to Yrak and during my stay there for a year, I studied the condition of the Grants worth some lakhs of rupees made by the Indians and ascertained that they were all dn a ruinous state. I talked about them to Colonel Ramsay, then Consul-General of Baghdad. II. On the 13th February 1909, the said Consul-General called me back from Lucknow by a letter through the Foreign Office. III. In compliance with the above letter I again went there and had a talk with him about the said Grants. Chiefly I dwelt upon the Wasiqa of Mobarik Mahal which amounts to Rs. 10,000 and is monthly sent to Yrak and said that this sum is not only meant to support the Moulvis and Mujtahids, as it had been hitherto supposed there, but it extends to the poor, the invalids and the sick. In the month of October 1909, the Consul-General was transferred from Baghdad and was succeeded by Mr. Lorimer. IV. The present Consul-General healing my suggestions and proposals about the said Wasiqa of Mobarik Mahal very kindly appointed a Committee of seven men to look after the managements of Wasiqa and chose me as one of the members of the said Committee. The Consul-General set aside a sum of Rs. 2,000 monthly out of Rs. 5,000 from the High Priests of Yrak and made it over to the Committee for distribution among the poor. V. In the month of March, 1909, he personally went to Yrak and asked the Committee to distribute the above sum in his own presence and thus rendered the people thankful to the British Government. VI. Out of that sum of Rs. 2,000 monthly, the Committee offered a sum of Rs. 200 monthly to the Consul-General so that he might with his own direct management and supervision as well receive pilgrims and visitors (going so often and in number too from India to visit their holy places who have often suffered severely at the hands of the free-booters of Ajum) from their ships and again send them oh to India in the like manner when they have finished their pilgrimage. Accordingly that system of management has been enforced from the month of February 1909. VII. Till March the 27th, 1909, I had been working with the Consul- General in an honorary capacity. After the enforcement of that manage ment, circumstances obliged me to submit my resignation and take leave of the Committee and withdraw to India. VIII. Indians have made numerous grants of lakhs of rupees in Yrak. It is spent in the most illegal way. The Government of Turkey gains at the expenses of the poor subject of the British India. This constitutes a loss of prestige of the British Government and the hard earned money of her subject is lost, IX. Undoubtedly all the managements made for the convenience of visi tors and pilgrims are of much benefit even to the Government. Through the above management the Government might easily learn and detect any of the pilgrims, if he has left his country owing to some objectionable ground. Hitherto all the other corrections made are much benevolent to the Grants. But I beg to draw the kind attention of the Government to still some other points :— {a) The above mentioned Committee should be termed as “ The Com mittee of Grants.” It also includes the Consul-General and the present Vice-Consul-General at Karbala. (b) The people should be asked to entrust all their Grants to the Com mittee so that it might look after them while I too offer my free services for that very purpose and thus we expect a consi derable benefits thereby. (c) Let us try that those houses of Yrak whjich are many in number and have been given by the people of India be considered as a free quarters or lodgings for the Indian travellers, thereby a portion of Yrak might come under the influence of the Government and the travellers from India be under perfect ease.16 {d) Karbala being the worship place of the Shias is a good resort of that class of people. On a place like that it is necessary that there should be a hospital. There is hardly any physician or hospital to be met with. In my opinion the Grants itself can easily establish and afford to do this. The late Consul-General 0 had himself acknowledged how badly it is needed there. Ac- * Secret G., April 1909, Nos. 10-13. (Enclosure COrdingly a letter* from 2 , Pro. No. io.) him, dated the 13th Feb ruary 1909, through the Foreign Office bears a testimony to it. I on being asked can explain all the advantages of establishing a hospital especially in Karbala. A letter, dated the 11th April 1909, from the Consul-General of Baghdad addressed to me, states that the Consul-General has himself written to the Government for an enquiry about the Grants of Yrak to be made in India. Therefore I hope that I too should be consulted about them so that I could express all what I know about them. I deem it an honour to serve my sect as I have been executing all these free services during my several stays in Yrak for a period of two years. I hope that His Excellency would consider over the points I have moved. No. 1160-G., dated the 27th May 1910. From-—J. B.

In continuation oif my letter No. 1089-G., dated the 21st May 1910, on the subject of the Oudh Bequest, I am directed to forward a copy of a letter, dated the 6th May 1910, from Syed Ahmed, High Priest of Lucknow, who is refer red to in paragraphs 13 and 14 of Mr. Lorimer’s letter No. 312, dated the 11th April 1910, a copy of which was forwarded to you with my letter quoted above. 2. Syed Ahmed’s request to be consulted in connection with the revised arrangements proposed for the administration of the Oudh Bequest will, no doubt, be duly considered by the United Provinces Government. 1 No. 1220-G., dated the 3rd June 1910.

In continuation of the telegram from the Government of India, in the Foreign Department, No. 1088-G., dated the 21st May 1910, I am directed to forward a copy of a letter, dated the 6th May 1910, from Syed Ahmed, High Priest of Lucknow, and to say that his desire to be consulted in connection with the revised arrangements proposed for the administration of the Oudh Bequest has been brought to the notice of the United Provinces Government. No. 561, dated Naini Tal, the 9th August 1910. From—The Hon’ble Mr. J. W.

With reference to Mr. Wood’s letters Nos. 1089-G., and 1160-G., dated the 21st and the 27th May 1910, I am directed to say that the consultation desired has taken place. But before the Lieutenant-Governor can offer a decided opinion upon the matter, I am to ask that if there is no objection a copy ofthe Government of India’s letter No. 1577-E., dated the 13th July 1903, and of connected papers (so far as they are relevant to the particular bequest) may be supplied for his information. 2. It appears also that there is some doubt as to the exact text (both English and Persian) of the portion of the treaty of the 17th August l82o relating to the bequest, and the intention of the donor is thus not clear, i i there is no objection and if it is practicable, I am to ask that accurate copies of the treaty as signed both in Persian and English may be supplied. That portion only seems to be needed which in English begins with the words ^ This allowance will be paid to the Begam Nabob ” and ends with the words “ derive its* benefits.” 3. If this portion of the treaty has before now been under consideration and any authoritative statement of its meaning has been made, I am to ask that the statement may be communicated to this Government. Extract from a despatch from the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General, Baghdad, to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, dated the 21st July 1910. ♦ * * * * * 9 In conclusion I may refer to a question which has not yet arisen. Some of the stipendiaries of the Oucih * Vide my despatch Xo. 513-15 of nth April g e q uest ^ Karbala have agreed* to hand mo ' v over f ths of their allowances hencefor ward to a local charitable committee for philanthropic purposes, and it is possible that the other stipendiaries may shortly follow their example, in that case the charitable committee will have a large annual sum at dieir dis posal ; and they may wish to spend part of it on arrangements for medical relief to Indian and other Shiah pilgrims. The only efficient and suitable kind of medical officer whom the committee would have it in their power to employ at Karbala would be a qualified Indian practitioner; and to enable him to practise freely, it would probably be necessary to obtain a special Pom- stantinople diploma as in the case of the Residency Surgeon. Most of his patients however would probably be British or Persian subjects. I mention this matter at the present stage of affairs only in order that no argument may be used in the course of negotiations at Constantinople, ot which the tendency would be to endanger the practicability of such an arrangement. No. 774, dated Baghdad, the 3rd September 1910 (Confidential). From-J. G. Loeimee, Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 312 of the 11th April 1910 relating to the Administration of the Oudh Bequest, I have the honour to draw the atten- luc -fxum the Government of India to an f Not printed, rw with originals. ar ticlet which appeared in the “Habl- ul-Matin ” newspaper of Calcutta in its issue of the 18th July 1910, in which my proceedings as Resident in connection with the said Bequest are criticised. I do not think that the Government of India will wish me to make any obser vations upon this article; and I mention it only with the purpose of stating that the writer, AH, is the brother of the Shaikh Husain (Mazandarani) who is mentioned in paragraphs 5 and 10 of my letter quoted above. 2. The questions connected with the Oudh Bequest which I have had the honour to submit to the Government of India are important and deserve the fullest and most mature deliberation; and I would not be understood to press for early orders upon them. At the same time there are disadvantages mdelay, especially the possibility that the Mujtahids who have agreed to dis burse two-fifths of their allowances in charity may be successfully worked upon by others and induced to repent of what they have done. I may also mention that I have for some time been receiving offensive letters, frequently anonymous or signed with false names, abusing me for my conduct in relation to the Bequest. In one of those lately received I was accused of having myself embezzled the sums connected with the Bequest which are held in deposit here pending receipt of the Government of India’s orders. (The accumulation of these sums, which cannot at present be in cluded in the Treasury accounts, is in fact a source of inconvenience.) As the Government of India are well aware, it is (impossible to move in any matter affecting Karbala and Najaf without exciting the hatred of some section of the excitable and unscrupulous Persian communities at those places; and, though the attacks which ensue are disagreeable to the object of them, there as no reason why they or their ramifications in India and elsewhere should be treated as of serious importance. The article in the “ Habl-ul-Matin ” is surprising chiefly for its modera tion which is greater than might have been expected, and is shown in an entire absence of personal abuse. 3. The Government of India will see, from copies of despatches to His Britannic Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople which I am submitting to them by this mail, that I am much engaged at present with inroads, actual or threatened, by the Turkish Local Government at Baghdad upon the property and rights of British subjects here. At this moment I could not safely leave Baghdad, even for a day; but I hope that the crisis will soon pass, and that, by the time the Government of India’s orders on the Oudh Bequest reach me, I shall be in a position to proceed to Karbala and carry them into effect. 4. *In conclusion I would draw attention to paragraph 14 of my last letter to the Government of India about the Oudh Bequest, in which it was indi cated that the matter of Shi’ah trusts is distinct from that of the Bequest and does not require to be considered in giving orders on the latter. Summary of events in Turkish Traq during the month of August 1910. 3. Nawab Ahmed ’Ali Khan, the doyen of the British Indian community 0 0 . T t t. ^ TV , at Baghdad, died suddenly at his gar- See Sumirary ft r February 1910, IX, 1. ■ , ° i i t i den-house at Qararah near Baghdad on the night of the 7-8th August. He seems to have passed away in his sleep ; and there is no real reason to suppose, though surmises to the contrary are expressed, that his death was other than natural. The body was seen by the Residency Surgeon and by Dr. Johnson of the Church Missionary Society within a few hours of his decease, but no autopsy was requested by the rela tives or performed. The Nawab’s demise throws open the succession to a Kingdom of Oudh Wasiqah (or allowance); but his estate is otherwise a damnosa hoereditas, consisting almost entirely of debts. The death of this fine old Indian gentle man has caused a perceptible blank in the society of which the British Resi dency at Baghdad is the centre; nor is there any one among his descendants able worthily to fill his place. The Nawab, familiarly known as “ Ahmad Agha,” was to the end a man of very active habits. Last winter I saw him, gun in hand, following par tridges through thorny jungle with as much ardour as any of his sons; and only last May he rode to Samarrah (nearly 100 miles) in two days, in very hot weather, to welcome me as Resident on my return from a tour in the north. His respect for and loyalty 'to the King-Emperor, which he never lost any opportunity of displaying, were quite exceptional in their warmth and were an example to all, including European British subjects.No. 2422-G., dated Fort William, tlie 29th November 1910.

In reply to your letter No. 561, dated the 9th August 1910, I am direct ed to forward a copy of the correspondence noted in the attached list regard ing the administration of the Oudh Bequest at Karbala and Najaf. 2. I am also to enclose photographs of the documents cited in the margin .which give the texts of the portion of the Treaty of 1825 relating to the Be quest. From the correspondence, a copy of which is now forwarded, it will be seen that the meaning of this portion) iof the Treaty has previously been under consideration and that in 1891 orders were issued as to its meaning. A doubt has been raised as to whether the original engagement in Persian, sealed svjitli the seal of the late King (marked No. 1 in the margin) which contains a ver sion of the passage in question somewhat different from those contained in the other texts, was examined in connection with the enquiry as to the meaning of the passage which led to the orders of 1891. 3. I am to request that the Government of India may be favoured with the opinion of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor as to the meaning to be attached to the passage in question.

A very moderately worded letter from the “ Ittihad-i-’Ilmiyah,” evi dently a Persian association at Karbala, has reached me, in which the writers ask to be informed whether any money from the Oudh Bequest is to be made available for purposes of charity. The letter concludes with the words :— It is well-known that the policy of your Government is to defend the poor and the weak, and we hope that you will not fail them in your support.” I believe that any reorganisation or modification of the present arrangements which the Government of India may see fit to approve will be greatly facili tated by the general confidence which undoubtedly exists, outside the domain of politics, in the benevolence and good intentions of the British. As it has been intimated to me that orders on the subject of the Oudh Bequest will shortly be issued by the Government of India, I have not for the present sent any reply to the Persian association.

Doubtless the Government at Constan tinople is finding it a difficult matter to carry out its social reform schemes when the expeditions against rebels in Albania and the Yemen are making heavy inroads upon the national purse. The Sheikh-ul-Islam has therefore adopted the role of a Henry VIII and ordered the appropriation of the trea sures which are now locked up in the shrines and do nothing to advance the prosperity of the Turkish Empire. The shrine of Nejef or Meshed Ali con tains the tomb of the fourth Khalif Ali, first cousin of the Prophet Mahomed and husband of his daughter Fatima. He is regarded by the Shia sect as the first legitimate Khalifa and his tomb is to them as holy as Ka’aba or as the tomb of Mahomed himself. At Kerbela is the tomb of Ali’s second son, Hus sain, whose tragic murder is every year commemorated in the month Mohar- ram. Both shrines are in the province of Baghdad. As Hussain was a direct descendant of the Prophet, Sunis largely combine with Shias to deplore his murder. The spoliation of these tombs would naturally arouse the greatest indignation among Shias. This sect flourishes most in Persia, but there are many of them in India also, among them being such distinguished personages as H. H. the Aga Khan, the Prince of Arcot, the ex-royal family of Oudh, etc. Every year the Moharram causes anxiety to the authorities in India, and not infrequently results in riots. The British Empire includes more Mussulman subjects than does any other political unit of the world, and it is therefore natural and proper that the British Government should have protested at Constantinople against a step calculated to inflame sectional hatred in the Moslem world.Political deft. mmm From To No. 302 of 1911. The Hon’ele Mr. J. W. HOSE, Chief Secretary to Government, © United Provinces, The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, F oreign department. Dated Allahabad, the 18fA March 1911. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with Major Patterson’s letter no. 361G., dated the 22nd February 1911,1 am directed to submit for the orders of the Government of India the views of the Lieutenant Governor on the subject of the Oudh bequest at Karbala and Najaf 2. In Mr. Wood’s letter no. 1089G., dated the 21st May 1910, forwarding certain proposals made by the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia for the better administration of that bequest it was asked that the feeling of the Lucknow Shia community might be ascertained and reported to the Government, of India together with the Local Govern ment’s opinion on the matter. Subsequently in Major Patterson’s letter no. 2422G., dated the 29th November 1910, three photographs were for warded of the papers forming the treaty under which the bequest was constituted, and it was remarked that a clause in the original deed exe cuted by the King of Oudh appeared to have been overlooked in previous discussions. The Lieutenant Governor was asked to give his opinion also as to the interpretation to be put on this passage. 3. As to the former point, I am to say that Mr. Lorimer’s pro posals were discussed by the Commissioner of Lucknow with representa tives of the Shia community and were considered at an informal conference with a number of prominent Shia gentlemen. The Commissioner writes as follows : “ Rdja Abu J’afar of Pirpur when passing through Luck now favoured me with his opinion and the matter was discussed with other gentlemen. It appeared however that the best means of carrying out the directions of Government would be to convene a small meeting of leading men of the community concerned where views and experiences could be exchanged. The following gentlemen were invited to, and atten ded, the meeting (1) S. Ndsir Husain, Mujtahid. (2) M. Saiyid Ahmad, Mujtahid. (3) Nawab Mehdi Hasan (Xgha Abbu Sahib). (4) M. Muhammad Shams-ud-din Haidar. (5) Nawab Murtaza Husain. • (6) Shaikh Hamid Ali Khan, Barrister-at-Law. (7) Shaikh Yusuf Husain Khan, Barrister-at-Law. (8) M. Shahinsh&amp;h Husain. (9) M. Saiyid Mukhtar Ahmad. (10) Saiyid Mehdi Hasan, Rizwi.tmm M ( 2 ) Number (1) is the head of the Lucknow Mujtahids. No (2) is the originator of the discussion. The Abbu Sahib, besides his social posi tion, is a great authority on Karbala and Najaf* which he has visited five times. He and no (4) are the Husainabad trustees (the third is not in Lucknow). Nos (8) and (9) are the gentlemen mentioned in paragraph 4 of the government order in connection with the resolution of the Shia Conference. The others are also prominent leaders of the community.” The opinion of these gentlemen was that the ap pointment of a charitable committee suggested by Mr. Lorimer was an excellent plan, but the limitation of the amount to be devoted to charity aroused protest. The effect of Mr. Lorimer^s proposals, if carried out, would be to deprive the recipient mujtahids of two-fifths of the income which they now enjoy under the bequest, and to devote this money to charity under the management of the Resident and an advisory committee. The conference raised the pertinent question why the proportion to be devoted to charity is to be limited to two-fifths. If the allowances are personal to the mujtahids, it is too much to ask them to give two-fifths in charity. If the mujtahids are merely agents of distribution it is too much to allow them to keep three-fifths for themselves. AVLile therefore M!r. Lorimer , s plan is approved as being a step in the right direction, it is not regarded as a completely satisfactory solution of the problem. 4. Mr. Lorimer’s proposals imply the acceptance of two principles which formed the main features of the reforms instituted by Lieutenant- Colonel Newmarch ; firstly the distribution amongst a number of muj tahids of sums approximately equal; and secondly the repudiation on the part of the British Government of all responsibility for the use made by the recipients of this money. The latter principle, it must be admitted, had apparently always formed part of the policy of the British Govern ment, but in practice a good deal of control seems to have been exercised by successive Residents over the disposal of the money. These two principles were restated in an emphatic form by the Government of India in their despatch no. 1577E. of 13th July 1903. In that letter it was laid down “. . . that the income of the bequest should be distributed under the supervision of the Resident to a certain number of mujtahids . . . probably not less than ten or more than twenty at each place . . . residing permanently at the shrines of Karbala and Najaf . . . and that it is not a mere charitable grant for the benefit of the poor of those places . . . No official cognizance will be taken of any distribution other than that to the mujtahids themselves.” On both these points Shia opinion in Lucknow is opposed to the attitude of the Government of India. The Commissioner of Lucknow was informed that there is and has been for some time past much dissatisfaction with the administration of the bequest, and in particular the reforms intro duced by Lieutenant-Colonel Newmarch have roused the strongest opposition. The present recipients are not considered to be real muj tahids at all, and it is very doubtful whether a single one of them would be chosen if the Lucknow Shias had a voice in the matter. The former distributors (the recipients up to 1903) are said to have been men who would nevei have dreamt of keeping an anna for themselves. A fewmen of this type are said to be forthcoming in Karbala and Najaf at the present moment, but they are not amongst the allowance holders, and this fact lowers the present administration in the eyes of Shias. 5. As to the second point on which the Government of India desire the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor, public opinion in Luck now is unanimous in holding that the bequest was essentially a chari table one. The money, it is said, is for charity to poor pilgrims and the mujtahids are merely distributors. Without going into questions of literal interpretation (and the conference had not the text of the origi nal document before it) the Lucknow Shias ask what their king had to do with Persian mujtahids. His object, they say, was to help poor and deserving pilgrims from his own country. The words of the treaty—■ “ that His Majesty might thereby derive its benefits ” are held to streng then this view. The spiritual benefit to the King would be derived directly from charity to the poor, and not from intervention of mujtahids as such. The mujtahid may, if poor, himself be a beneficiary or he may be an agent of the distribution, but as offering prayers or performing ceremonies he would be superfluous. In short, public opinion in Lucknow, demands nothing less than the devotion to charity of the whole of the income of the bequest. 6. There is moreover a general wish in Lucknow that some con trol over the administration of the bequest should be exercised. It was suggested that there should be a standing committee in Lucknow 7 which should be consulted as to the selection and removal of allowance holders and on other questions of importance, such for instance as the proposal to establish a hospital for the benefit of Indian pilgrims. Mr. Lorimer’s suggestion that he should himself visit Lucknow and consult with the heads of the Shia community w^as very well received. Finally the meet ing requested the Commissioner of Lucknow to express to Government their thanks for the steps taken to protect the interests of the Indian Shias. 7. The interpretation of the intention of the bequest, which is favoured by the Shias of Lucknow, finds most convincing support in the passage in the original engagement in Persian executed by the King of Oudh, which is mentioned in the Government of India’s letter of No vember last. This document, as is remarked in that letter, does not appear to have been examined when the subject has previously been under discussion. If Colonel Jarrett, on w 7 hose report the previous orders of the Government of India were based, had seen this version, he could not, the Lieutenant Governor thinks, have failed to notice a clause which puts the intentions of the donor beyond reasonable doubt. The Lieutenant Governor has taken advice in the matter from Mr. B. Lindsay, I.C.S., who was recently Legal Bemembrancer to this Government and is himself an accomplished Persian scholar. The advice is to the effect that the written contract between the Governor General and the King of Oudh consists of two documents,—the original deed in Persian executed by the King (no. 1 of the photographs) and the bilingual document signed by the Governor General (no. 3 of the photographs). The first differs from the second in two important points. The words translated by Colonel Jarrett as “the supreme theological* ( 4 ) doctors who are continuous residents near the holy shrines ” are written in the original deed as follows:—, the ) (alif) between } and ^ in being marked with a madd ( «« ),— thus ] . The phrase should therefore read : mujhtahidan-i-mujawir-i-an astan, i.e. mujtahids who are mujawir of (i.e. continuously resident near) that shrine, viz. Najaf or Karbala mentioned above. This point is to be noted not only because it shows that Colonel Jarrett’s translation of the phrase is substantially correct, but also because it disproves a sugges tion which has been made that the word mujawir is used in the technical sense of “ domiciled pilgrim.” 8. Further, and this is the most important point, the original deed (no. 1) contains the following words not to be found in the bilingual document (no. 3) : “ ki musharun ilaihim az taraf-i-injanib binabar-i- kasb-i-sawab ba arbab-i-istihqaq taqsim mekardah bashand ” [“ in order that the above-named mujtahids may distribute it on my behalf to the deserving for acquisition of (spiritual) reward”.] Here it is clearly laid down that the money is not to be paid to the mujtahids for their own benefit, but that they were intended to be merely the agents for the distribution of the King’s bounty, and were to divide the money among the deserving (arbab-i-istihqaq) with the object of obtaining a spiritual benefit to the King himself. The corre sponding clause in the bilingual document is ambiguous ; at the same time it is clear even here, that the King contemplated the earning of spiritual merit. It is hardly reasonable to suppose that the object could be attained by the bestowal of a large sum of money annually on persons like foreign mujtahids who are not, or ought not to be, in need of it. The discrepancy between the original and the bilingual counterpart is difficult to explain, but is probably due to negligence, a theory which derives some support from the fact that the translation into English was made without strict regard to the Persian contents. The transla tion is admittedly inaccurate and in one instance at least has been made after the interpolation of words not to be found in the Persian text. This difference however makes it necessary to determine which of the two documents should be taken to contain the authentic version of the agreement. In Mr. Lindsay’s opinion, which Sir John Hewett accepts, it can hardly be doubted that the original deed executed by the King of Oudh (no. 1) should prevail. It was the King who was making the loan, and it was for him to lay down the conditions about the manner of the payment of interest, and the object of that payment. 9. The conclusion then to be derived from the original text of the bequest is clear, that the mujtahids ought to distribute the whole money in charity upon deserving recipients ; and this was clearly understood in Turkish Arabia itself (where the mujtahids receiving the money were and still are called “ distributors ”) until the reforms instituted by Lieu tenant-Colonel Newmarch. These reforms, undertaken because the nominal distribution by one mujtahid at each centre had fallen into gross abuse, have substituted a distribution by the Resident to mujtahids for a distribution by mujtahids. To make any such agreement with the present recipients as is proposed by Mr. Lorimer, whereby they would be enabled to keep for their personal enjoyment the larger portion ofthis money, on condition of giving up the smaller portion to charity, would not only be to subsidize a body of men who do not appear to command the confidence of their co-religionists, but would also defeat the apparent intentions of the donor. What the treaty appears to have contemplated was a distribution by the mujtahids, and moreover by mujtahids who should be men of such position and character that they would administer the bequest properly. 10. Finally it appears to Sir John Hewett that in view of article 4 of the body of the deed of agreement between the King and the Company (page 157, vol. I, Aitchison, fourth edition) it is incumbent on the British Government to see that the King’s expressed desire is carried out. This article, it is true, refers in the first instance to the Lucknow stipendiaries ; bub it may, in the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor, be held to indicate what the King desired should be the action of the British Government as regards all payments. His Honour is unable to support the suggestion of the Lucknow Conference that a committee should be established at Lucknow, or the tenth resolution of the All India Shia Conference held in December 1909, which is ambi guously worded bub apparently advocates the intervention of a central standing waqf committee ; but he is of opinion that some measure of control by the British Government over the administration of the be quest is contemplated in the treaty. The resolutions passed by the last two sessions of the All India Shia Conference leave no doubt in his mind that any action taken by the Government to secure that leading mujtahids should, either personally or through an agent, dis tribute the whole income of the bequest to deserving recipients would meet with the fullest approval of the Indian Shia community at large.

The “ Maqtabas ” newspaper (Damascus) of the 10th November contains the following remarkable communication from Baghdad, with reference • See Summary for A„gu.t 1910 , i- 2 . to Naxim Pasha’s supposed * settlement with the Hamawands. I cannot either confirm or deny the allegations which it contains. “ Nazim Pasha accepted the submission of the Hamawands and let them go free,—the Hamawands, who have killed hundreds of our soldiers before and since the Constitution. Not only this : he also wrote to the Wall of Musal not to listen to any complaints against the Hamawands, but to hand complainants over to a court-martial. “ The outlaws then began to levy blackmail on the villages of which the inhabitants had acted as guides to the troops or otherwise helped them, and the poor people are obliged to pay it. Is this according to law ? “ Muhammad Khurshid, the greatest of the outlaws and chief of the Dawudiyah tribe, made his submission to Nazim Pasha; and Nazim Pasha t See Summary for August, 1-10. ) vrote to tlie Mutasarrif of Kirkuk, the free-minded f ’Aun TJllah-al-Kadhimi, to pardon all his misdeeds.

Khurshid then wrote the Mutasarrif a letter, in which he offered to pay £T.4,000 if his submission were accepted and he were pardoned. The Mutasarrif telegraphed to the Wall. The Wall replied asking what guarantee there was. The Mutasarrif answered: ‘His promise to pay it to thee is a sufficient guarantee.’ ” “ Behold and wonder ! ’A.

To all who would understand the political position and state of Kurdistan, an excellent new confidential report by Mr. Soane on the “Sulaimania District of Kurdistan,” printed by the Government of India (Calcutta, 1910), may be recommended. The notes on Turkish and Persian administration in Kurdistan (pages 45-47) and those on the Turkish military forces in the district (pages 51-53) will be read first. II. Baghdad Wilayat. 1. On the 4th of November an affray took place near the Pul-i-Safid or White Bridge, about three miles from Karbala, between two Arabs of the Mas’ud tribe.^ One shot the other dead with a revolver ; but he was captured and brought in to Karbala, as was also the body of his victim. 2018 F. D.2. About the 15th of November a skirmish occurred in Najaf by night between Turkish soldiers and some Arabs who had smuggled a dead body into the town, in defiance of a temporary sanitary regulation, for burial. The Arabs are said to have fired first, but got the worst of it and fled, leaving behind them the corpse and six of their own number dead. 3. It is stated that Saib Bey’s appointment * as Mutasarrif of Karbala 1 See last Summary, II—9. was made by Nazim Pasha on his own responsibility, and that it has not been ratified, and is not likely to be so, by the Porte. In my opinion any increase of military influence in the civil administration of this country is undesirable at present: it is already too strong. 4. Saib Bey, since his arrival at Karbala, has shown considerable activity in touring. On the 4th and 5th November he was absent on a journey to Musaiyib, the Hindiyah Barrage, and Tawirij. His object at Musaiyib was to investigate a dispute between the Mudir and the local commandant of Gendarmerie, between whom there is friction. I have not heard whether he presented himself to any of the British engineers at the Barrage. On the 11th and 12th of November the Mutasarrif was at Tawairij inspecting some of the canals from the Hindiyah, to the unregulated condition of which the overflowing of the lake known as the Hor-as-Sulaimaniyah near Karbala is attributed. It will be remembered that forced subscriptions have t See my Tour Diary No. i of 1909 under date of sometimes been levied at Karbala for 16th December. ^ ^ repairing the dykes f which protect the town against inundation by the lake, aud that attempts have occasionally been made to oblige British subjects to contribute against their will. A third tour by Saib Bey extended from the 14th to the 23rd of November and took him to Najaf. His principal object was to settle a land dispute there between the Kilid-dar of the shrine and some other persons, but he also went into the question of municipal improvements. A son of Mulla Kazim, the Mujtahid, came to the Mutasairif at Najaf with apologies for his father’s not calling in person, and Saib Bey afterwards visited Mulla Kazim at the latter’s own house ; but what passed between them is not known. At his return to Karbala he brought with him a detachment of 45 men of the II th Nishanjis from Najaf. I mention these tours, though unimportant, because they are the first made by a Turkish civil official that have come under my notice. 5. The Turkish Government hospital l at Karbala has been begun ; the site is On the right or further bank of the Hanai- diyah canal, which circles round Karbala upon its western side. t See Summary for August, V—1, On the 17th November about 100 donkeys belonging to private owners were seized by subordinates of the Karbala Municipality to carry bricks for the hospital without payment. Money subscriptions are being collected in Karbala, not without threats ; and the British Vice-Consul has been obliged to protest to the Mutasarrif in writing against pressure being brought to bear on British Indian subjects to make them contribute. The ceremony of laying the foundation stone was performed on the 26th of November by the Mutasarrif before a concourse of civil and military officials, leading citizens, etc. Such troops and gendarmerie as were available were paraded. Special prayers were recited by the Mufti, and sheep were sacrificed. The modern Turks seem to be inordinately fond of ceremonies § of § Compare Summary for June, III— 3. this kind. Tim British Vice*ConSul W3S present by special invitation and was the third person to add a stone to the building. The Persian Consul pleaded indisposition and sent his Dragoman to represent him. 6. During his stay at Najaf the Mutasarrif took up the question of street* widening there. It is said that he professes to have discovered in the main bazaar, which leads to the shrine of ’Ali, the foundations of some shops built by3 It* % knife liiitti itti* Shah ’Abbas the Great of Persia as a religious endowment; and that he has informed the owners that the site will necessarily revert to the Turkish Auqaf Department 1 Saiyid Jaw wad, the wealthy Kilid-dar of Najaf, and scores of other persons would, I am informed, suffer heavily if the ground and buildings on it were forfeited, and disturbances of some kind might be expected. III.— Baghdad City. 1. House demolitions have proceeded apace during the past month in the street which the Wali now apparently intends to make the principal thorough fare of Baghdad. The scheme for an entirely new street * through the heart 0 J 0 TTT of the town seems now to be receding * See last Summary, 111 —4. t, n ti into the limbo of unrealised ambitions. Among the buildings which at present lie frontless and partly dismantled are Messrs. S. Lynch’s office and warehouses, the only hotel habitable by Europeans which exists at Baghdad, and the late club house of the Committee of Union and Progress. 2. On the 2nd of November there was a strike of the Baghdad butchers, and no meat was procurable. The cause was an order by the Wali that animals should not be slaughtered so close to the town as hitherto. On the next day the butchers agreed to an arrangement under which they were not to kill in future within 300 yards of the edge of the town. 3. A report has been submitted by M. Godard and other engineers on a scheme for an esplanade upon the left bank of the Tigris at Baghdad, running the whole length of the town. This project has some points in its favour, but I should expect its cost to work out at an impossible figure, as much land reclamation and strong masonry revetment would be required. Some disturb ance of vested rights would also be involved, for the esplanade would detract from the value of the best houses in the town, those that stand immediately on the bank and overlook nothing but water. 4. The President of the Baghdad Municipality has once again f been „ o T „ * changed. The Wall’s new nominee is t see last ummary, — . Colonel Bessim Bey of the Army Medical Service, who is one of his own staff officers. The pretext for this appointment is that sanitary matters bulk so largely in municipal business that it is advis able to have a medical expert at the head cf affairs. If I am not mistaken as to his identity, however, the new President is not an authority on Public Health, but was a Professor of Anatomy before he came to Baghdad. 5. There are reasons for suspecting that some hitch has occurred in connec- TTT „ tion with the Baghdad t Municipal Loan. I ee last ummaiy, . The draft contract arrived from Constan tinople some time ago and was handed to the W ali for signature, since when, notwithstanding his impatience on the subject of the loan, nothing more has been heard of it. The only explanation that I have heard here is to the effect that the Turkish Government have refused to sanction the loan until they have seen and approved of a programme regulating its expenditure.

A standing commission for the local purchase of supplies for the troops was formed at Baghdad about the beginning of November. The President is Colonel Rasim Bey, Chief of the 2nd Section of the Staff of the Army Corps. The members, all civilians, are ’Abdul Qadir Pasha (Khadhairi), Muhammad Ja’far (Chalabi), al-Hajj Pawud (a merchant), Mahmud (Chalabi), son of . c , , c , r Mustafa Salim, and Shaul Shashu’ (a Jewish merchant). The first-named member is one of the Waifs new favourites.! 3. It is stated that the direct control of the Gendarmerie in the Baghdad Army Corps district has been transferred from the head of the Gendarmerie Department in the War Office at Constantinople to the Governor-General of Baghdad. 4. A body of about 600 men mounted on mules arrived at Baghdad from Kirkuk on the 23rd ft ovember. It is stated that these represent the 35th Cavalry Regiment, one of those of which the conversion l into mounted + See Summary for June, v— 4 . infantay was recently ordered ; but, if this is true, an explanation will have to be sought of the means by which a single regiment has been raised to such a phenomenal strength. I expect that the so-called 35th will be found to include the bulk of the 36th Regiment, and I shall not be surprised if the 33rd and 34th Regiments have also been laid under contribution. (b) Civil. 5. It is announced that the Turkish police will in future wear Qolpaqs (sheepskin caps) and be equipped with American pistols and electric lanterns. 6. It is understood that an Istinaf or High Court has recently been established at Basrah. Istinaf cases from Basrah were formerly heard in the High Court at Baghdad. 7. It is expected that the Qadha of Kut-al-Amarah § in the Baghdad § See Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Vol. II, page 736. P re S6ntly be made a Sanjaq, with Badrah as one of its Qadhas. Khurasan also will be raised to the status of a Mutasarrifliq having Khanaqin, Mandali and Samarrah (already Qadhas) and Khalis (now a Nahiyah) as its principal sub-divisions. In the Basrah Wilayat, it is stated, ’Ali-al-Gharbi and Majar al-Kabir, at present Nahiyahs of the ’Amarah Qadha, will become separate Qadhas. If the above changes mean a real improvement in the class of the officers employed at the various places in question, they will be an advantage; if not, they will be a useless expense. 8. The Baghdad newspaper “Raqib” has been suppressed: it ceased to appear from the 20th of October. The reason alleged for its suspension was that a charge of sodomy against the editor was pending in the courts; but it is stated that this charge was brought at the instance of Nazim Pasha, to whom the paper had given trouble. 9. News has been received of the appointment of an Assistant Wali for Baghdad in the person of one Lutfi Bey. This gentleman is said to be a judge of the “Mixed Marine Commercial Court ” at Constantinople; but I am not sure of the proper designation of the tribunal in question. Lutfiit to mlii imljtoEi * See last Summary, III—6. f See last Summary, V—19, There is no likely to get it. J See Summary for June, V—8. § See Summary for July, Y—15. Bey’s position as “MnWin” will be next in dignity, among the civil officials at Baghdad, to that of the Governor-General. 10. On the 13th of November I received a visit from Eram Bey, the Wali’s Political Secretary, who evidently came to find out what I thought of some rumours, then current, that he was about to he dismissed. I suggested that the rumours might have arisen from the nomination of an Assistant Wali, whose functions were perhaps expected by some to absorb those of the Political Secretary. In fact I know of no better foundation for them ; but it is stated that correspondence which was formerly dealt with by Eram Bey is now going to the Tahrirat Mudiri of the Wilayat instead. Eram Bey told me, previously to this visit, that Nazim Pasha had offered him the Presidentship of the Baghdad Municipality, but that he had declined it, which was certainly a mark of prudence * on his part. 11. It is understood that Eram Bey aspires to the managership of the Idarah Nahriyah steamers in succession to Sirop Effendi; f but he is not very doubt that the Wali wishes to get rid of Sirop Effendi, whose house J he no longer requires; but he feels a natural delicacy about recommending the dismissal of the man whom he praised § so highly to the Constantinople authorities only a few months ago, and whose pay he succeeded in getting raised from £T. 25 to £T. 40 a month. The Wali appears to have been pressing ’Abdul Qadir Pasha || IISee paragraph 2 above, and Summary for (IChadhairi) to undertake the management September, xi—6 . 0 f the Turkish steamers ; but the latter is said to he reluctant, and a premature report of his appointment was contra dicted in the “ Zaura, ” official newspaper of the 12th November. 12. At the beginning of November, Sir William Willcocks, whose contract of service under the Turkish Government is for five years but terminable at any time on his giving six months’ notice, was much inclined to accept an offer of employment which he had received from the Government of South Australia. He even drew up a telegram of acceptance, which he requested me to send for him in cypher, but on reconsideration he withheld it and declined the offer. During the month Sir William continued to press for the immediate appointment of a contractor for the New Hindiyah Barrage, who should order his materials for 1911 at once and take over the work of construction in January. The Minister of Public Works, however, remained inflexible. He endeavoured to refute the arguments for instant action which Sir William based on the precarious state of the Old Barrage; he referred to an agreement at Constantinople under which, he said, Sir William had promised to carry on the works until the end of 1326 A.H., though Sir William in reality only undertook the responsibility for them up to the end of 1911 A. D.; and he finally refused to entertain the proposal on the ground that it would entail a modification of the administrative and financial arrangements already made. A telegram from the Minister to Sir William, dated 21st November, ended with the words : “ Tout en vous exprimant ma confiance en vos talents, jetiens cependant a vous faire observer que le succbs de 1’oeuvre grandiose que vous dirigez demande essentiellement que Ton marche methofliquement d’apres des programmes arretes d’avance qui ne soient pas sujets a des modifications importantes en cours d’execution.” (The reproach of not abiding by programmes seems most applicable to the Ministry of Public Works itself, which has arranged matters in such a way that the Engineer in charge cannot get the funds sanctioned by the Turkish Parliament as they are required.) Sir William replied to the Minister’s strictures by reiterating his opinion that every day was of importance, and by throwing on the Ministry the respon sibility for any future accident, due to excessive pressure, which might occur at the Old Barra,ge in consequence of the present avoidable delay. 2018 E.

This is a very considerable gain; but, as Sir William Willcocks has been urging on the Turkish Government, its per manence is doubtful owing to the enormous pressure to which the Old Barrage is subject in the absence of the New. Some of Sir William’s funds are now being diverted to the general purposes of the Wilayat. On three occasions lately the Wali took part of certain sums drawn for the irrigation works, Sir William being unable to obtain the counter- signature of his bills on any other terms. Since then the Wali has Counter signed and appropriated the whole proceeds of a bill of Sir William’s for £. T. 1,000; the money was required for paying a British firm at Basrah, t See last Summary, m-i 2 . but it is now being spent on the Baghdad- Q,ararah f embankment. The Wali also draws frequently on the irrigation grants for the more appropriate purpose of ; See Summary for v-u. clearing out the Hillah Branch, a work * which has been undertaken by him in supersession of the engineers. Mr. Medlicott, § Sir William Willcock’s principal assistant, and Colonel § See Summary for September, V-5. Tompkins, the head of his transport depart ment, are leaving the Turkish service from the 1st and 16th of December, respectively. I believe there have been diffi culties between them and their chief ; but these are no doubt due, indirectly, to the impossibility of carrying on work without friction under the present finan cial arrangements.

It is stated that the anti-Nazim Pasha clique of late Baghdad officials, etc., now at Constantinople have appealed to the governing body of the Committee of Union and Progress at Salonika against the apathy of the Committee at Baghdad, and have recommended that efforts should be made to recruit the Committee there from the non-official classes, officials being too open to pressure and inducement to be reliable. In my opinion it is most unlikely that the Committee will find any greater independence among merchants or others, in present circumstances, than among officials. • See s™ y for j m ., v-i 2 . ^ Murad B ^'* ^ Chadurji and Hamdi Bey are said to be all now at the capital. 1M 15. Isma’il Haqqi Bey,f Deputy for Baghdad, who has been travelling in t See last s™r y ,v-i5. this during the parliamentary recess, delivered a speech lasting three- quarters of an hour before the Committee of Union and Progress here on the 11th of November. He said that the Chamber of Deputies were not indifferent to the fate of ’Iraq, as had already been proved on more than one occasion,:|: and that on {The reference nmy be to tbe - Affair. Lynch- t0 . Constantinople he WOUldgiye of last winter. them his views, formed from personal ^fcjKaitjjj investigation, as to the requirements of the province. More education for the people was a crying necessity, and one which he hoped that the local authorities would not overlook. The nomadic tribes should be settled on the land, and more attention should be given to agriculture ; by these means expenditure would be reduced and revenue augmented. It should be clearly understood, both by the local authorities and by the people, that ’Iraq was not a foreign dependency but one of the provinces of a consti iMm f® pttjfcdi B(rojfctrffii| ‘fiifi^ti^ tutional country. There is now reason to believe that Isma’il Haqqi Bey, who left Baghdad for Constantinople a few days after delivering the above speech, really held a commission from exalted quarters to report on the state of affairs in Mesopotamia. It is stated that he sent two telegrams from here, in a special f'vnnPT* nnt.

The points on which he was asked to report are said to have been (a) the policy to be pursued in the Muntafik country : (b) the probability of British aggression in the direction of Basrah, which Nazim Pasha had reported to be exposed to attack for want of a fleet: and (&lt;?) the character and pro ceedings of Nazim Pasha himself. Nothing can be ascertained here as to the sense in whicii he has advised on these questions ; and it will be observed that in his speech at Baghdad he avoided giving any but the vaguest hints of his views. His silence while here is an unfavourable omen for Nazim Pasha. {alMrsfiji 16. The question of coercing the refractory “ Muntafik ” is gradually coming to the front, and it seems probable that decided action of some kind will presently be imposed on the Wali by his official superiors. iJJl k^ 9 oiiry i W® {fffsselaiW® lis*^ It appears to be the case that Nazim Pasha did some time ago propose that the whole Muntafik country should be made over to Sa’dun Pasha§ as § See last Summary, iv-3. “ Mamur-al-Islah ” for reformation of its affairs; but the scheme was appa rently rejected by the Central Government, whether on general principles or on the advice of Isma’il Haqqi Bey. It is stated, however, that Sa’dun Pasha is now none the less acting as Mutasarrif of the Muntafik Sanjaq. I hear from an excellent source that about the middle of November a conver 40^ Wff! IfiiW 11 * ■ 00^ sation took place by telegraph between the Minister of War at Constanti nople and Nazirn Pasha at Baghdad on the subject of possible Muntafik operations. The Wali, on being pressed to say what arrangements he could make, offered to send Yusuf Pasha or Shamil Pasha, both of whom knew the Muntafik country, “ with all the available troops but he was told in reply that this would not answer, and that he ought to go himself. He then pleaded ill health, and remarked that in any case he would require eight additional battalions, which might be sent him from Sami Pasha’s force in the Hauran when no longer needed there. The rejoinder was a query as to why he had not mentionedB this requirement in proposing to send Yusuf Pasha or Shamil Pasha against the Muntafik. The Minister of War seems to have closed the discussion with an intimation that Nazim Pasha would have either to obey orders or to resign. The flesh-pots of Baghdad probably appeal more strongly to a man of Nazim Pasha’s temperament than the rigours of a winter campaign in the so- called “marshes all the more so that, with the slender means at his disposal, he cannot be sure that the result of the operations would he conclusive or in any way advantageous to his reputation. 17. According to information received, the Wali has now been given to understand that he must not look for grants or subventions from Constantinople, but must exert himself to recover the taxes payable by the Arab tribes, and endeavour to make his province so far as possible self-supporting. These orders, which he was certain to receive sooner or later, cannot but disturb the pleasant conception which Nazim Pasha had formed for himself of his position and prospects here. It was evidently his policy to keep the tribes quiet by letting them alone ; and his idea of developing the country seems to have been to provide it with some of the external insignia of civilisation b y means of funds granted, borrowed, or obtained otherwise than by regular taxation. In other words there was to be no sordid anxiety or worry about ways and means. But Constantinople has grown parsimonious; there seems even to be a difficulty about the Baghdad Municipal Loan, the only one that Nazim Pasha has been able to arrange ; and the concessionnaires whom he hoped to utilise for carrying out most of his schemes have proved too shy to he caught. 18. The case of Sarah Zanginah,* whose family name is Sikanderian, has • See last Summary, v-i9. taken , an unexpected turn during the past month; and the unfortunate young lady is now in a somewhat dangerous position. It is certain that the Wali now wishes to marry her by force to his butler Suren, and he has frequently summoned her to his house ; but she has so far had the strength of mind to refuse to comply with his summons. The whole of the Military barracks at Baghdad were aroused one night, as I am informed, by a sudden telegraphic order from the Wali for the arrest of her lover and fiance, who had lately been taken for military service ; but as the youth had been granted leave a day or two previously the order could not be executed at once. Later, however, he was found and imprisoned until he had renounced his pretensions to Sarah ; and he has now been deported to Basrah. On the evening of the 24th November, while Mr. Mercurian, the Manager of the Baghdad branch of the Ottoman Bank, was at the British Residency, Sarah came there in search of him. Mr. Mercurian had already been instru mental, at the request of the Wali, in obtaining from Sarah an egagement ring Tl, which her fianc6 had given her. She now came to tell Mr. Mercurian that the police were in search of her, for some unknown reason ; and she asked for an interview with me, which I felt obliged to refuse on the ground of her being a Turkish subject. Mr. Mercurian advised her to seek shelter for the night with some friend ; and she seems to have gone from the Residency to the house of a certain Mr. N. Thaddeus, a merchant and a British subject, whose wife is her first cousin. On the next day, the 25th November, two of Sarah’s female domestics’were arrested by the police on a charge of having spoken against the Wali; but the lady herself was left unmolested at Mr. Thaddeus’s house. On the morning of the 28th Sarah again appeared at the Residency, disguised as a Muhammadan woman, and asked to see my wife. I made no objection to this and sent the Pirst Dragoman to interpret for her. She was much agitated and carried in her hand a small box containing the best of her jewellery and it appeared that what she sought was some kind of protection against the Wali. To my wife, she said that she knew she would be killed ifshe had been ordered, but she gave the Dragoman to understand that the Wali himself had designs * on her honour, combined with the project of marrying her to Suren and so obtaining control of her fortune, which is about £T. 25,000. I was very sorry to be obliged to send her a message that as she was a Turkish subject, I could not give her any assistance or advice ; but at the same time, as the matter seemed indirectly to affect the credit of the Residency, I telegraphed the facts to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople not of course letting it he known that I did so. The whole affair has now become so notorious that I doubt whether the Wali will dare to proceed to extremities. What he has already done, however, seems likely to prejudice his personal and official reputation more seriously than any other acts of oppression which he has committed since his arrival at Baghdad. 19. It will he apparent, I think, from many passages in this and earlier reports that Nazim kasha’s administration of ’Iraq is worse than a failure Its oppressiveness whether as regards Turkish subjects or Asiatic foreigners such as Persians is extreme; and its stupidity and inefficiency for all useful purposes are no less marked. A board of half-a-dozen British working men would, I believe, govern ’Iraq with more intelligence, sympathy and success than this Pasha and all his Beys. The difficulty is to know to what extent the personality of the Wali is responsible for the unsatisfactory present and unpromising future here and to what extent they are a consequence of the general political conditions now prevailing throughout Turkey under the direction of a militarist clique. A change of personnel at Baghdad could not, I am now inclined to think, make things worse than they are; and the chances seem to be that a new Local Government, even if equally despotic, must at least he more intelligent than the present one. The removal of Nazim Pasha is ardently desired by almost all classes at Baghdad, and by many persons it appears to be regarded as an imminent contingency. I entered on my relations with Nazim Pasha strongly prepossessed in his favour, but after six months’ experience of him, I find no good qualities in him except courage and respect for his plighted word. He has many had qualities, and his fearlessness, unfortunately, only enlarges his capacity for working evil. she went to the Wall’s house, as *It is impossible to know whether this allegation is true, but Sarah is a young and handsome woman and there are various suspicious circumstances. To my surprise the allegation in question has recently reached me from a Muhammadan source also. VI —Persian Affairs. 1. The two Babist arrested at Najaf in August and extradited to Persia t See Summary for Augmrt, VI-4. Of having COnSpiied to mUt- der the Mujtahid Mulla Kazim (Khura san!) are said to have been allowed to escape while within the jurisdiction of the Governor of Kirmanshah. Mulla Kazim is greatly perturbed at this event and has been heard to declare that the whole of Persia is turning Babi. 2. The purport of the British Note $ to the Persian Government on the : See last Summary, vi-6. subject of the insecurity of the Bushehr- Isfahan road became known among the Persians in this country, generally in a distorted form, during the first week of November. The British Vice-Consul at Karbala has since been doing his best to remove such misapprehensions on the subject as he finds prevailing. Saiyid Muhammad Riza,§ Deputy for Tabriz, who was then passing through § see Summary for September, vi— 5 . Baghdad on his return from Najaf to Tehran, endeavoured to work up excite ment on the subject among the Persians of Baghdad and Kadhimain. He resorted to pan-Islamic appeals; but his efforts, which were impeded by the cholera quarantine, seem to have fallen flat. He also wrote to Mulla Muhammad Kazim, the Najaf Mujtahid, about the matter; and a certain Mirza Muhammad Taqi (Shirazi) of Samarrah10 telegraphed to Saiyid Muhammad Kazim (Yazdi), who is really the greatest and most respectable of the Najaf Mujtahids, imploring him to arrange, if possible, a national combination for resisting the supposed encroachment on Persian independence. The Mujtahids seem to have been brought into action, however, by a telegram from the Persian Anjuman-i-Sa’adat at Constantinople in which the nature of the British demands was misrepresented and the Mujtahids were urged to publish a protest, to order the collection of money in Persia for raising an army of defence, to stimulate the tribes of Southern Persia to oppose British action, etc., This telegram was received at a time T w when false rumours* were still current * see last Summary, v - . that the Shaikh of Muhammarah had openly placed himself under British protection and renounced his allegiance to the Shah. Nevertheless the two most politically active of the Najaf Mujtahids (Mulla Kazim and Shaikh ’Abdullah) confined themselves to issuing two telegraphic manifestoes, which have since been published in the ‘^Najaf ” newspaper; and those manifestoes, one of which is addressed to the civilised powers of the world ” except Bussia and Britain, and the other to “ Tehran, through the Parliament, and other places, through the Government and local Anjumans,” are in themselves documents of an unexpectedly milk-and-water character. In the former telegram the manifestants throw the blame prin cipally on Bussia; and they do justice, to some extent, to the self-restraint 14 hitherto ” exhibited by Britain and to her “former ” reputation for uphold ing justice and liberty. They merely appeal, in fact, in a general manner to the good offices of other powers. In the latter telegram they advise those addressed to appeal, as they themselves have done, to the Ambassadors of the great powers, adding that even the Muhammadans of Tunis and Algiers and the Tartars of Constantinople are working with them, and that all internal dissensions in Persia should be suppressed in the face of this new danger. The chief reason of the moderation of the Mujtahids is to be found, no doubt, in the woes into which the Persians of ’Iraq have suddenly been plunged by the action of the local Turkish execu tive, as described f further on; and the following remarks by the British Vice- Consul X at Karbala are worthy of perusal: — “ The Mujtahids $ are said to be in a state of dilemma, not knowing what § I think he refers to the Khurasani and the steps they should take to stop internal Mazandarani only. ^ ^ disorder and prevent Great Britain and Bussia from interfering with the affairs of their country. The public are mostly against the Mujtahids, and those who are still friendly with them have despaired of Persia’s further living as an independent State ; they are therefore keeping quiet and merely passing confused opinions as to what should be done by the Mujtahids. The ’ Amalayah Mukallafah and the registration which is going on jn Najaf are being felt more intensely by the Persians than any other question in existence.” I think it cannot be too soon or too clearly realised that Persian demonstra tions in this country are mere nonsense. They perhaps carry some weight in Persia, but it is fictitious. The only Mujtahids who play any active part in politics are the Khurasani and the Mazandarani at Najaf/and they are not the most respected as religious leaders. The rest seem wisely to abstain from inter ference in public affairs. During the year that I have passed at Baghdad I have not been able to trace the slightest effect upon the course of events from the wordy effusions of the two Mujtahids mentioned ; and I think that even they themselves now realise their powerlessness in the presence of secular forces, and that they only continue to issue manifestoes because it has come to be expected of them, and because they would relap&amp;e into insignificance if they were to stop. If my views are erroneous as regards Persia, I trust that thev may be corrected by some one better informed whose eye these words may meet 3. I am informed, with what degree of truth I know not, that the II See Summaiy for September, Khurasani and Mazandarani Mujtahids* . suggestion ||: for a boycott of Bussian goods in Persia have been very coldly received, if not ignored:, at Tehran. t See paragraphs S to 10 below. t Mirza Muhammad Hasan Mohsin. He is him self a Shi’ah, and by descent practically a Persian._ 4. Another Persian senator, Haji Agha Nnr Ullah, brother of Agha Najafi, Mnjtahid of Isfahan, has lately come to this country. On the 2nd of Novemher he passed through Musaiyib and Karbala on his way to IS T ajaf r making no stay at Karbala, apparently because he had been requested by Mulla Muhammad Kazim, Mujtahid, to come to Najaf with the least possible delay. On the 10th of November he returned to Karbala, and on the 13th he had a conversation there with the British Vice-Consul, to whom he complained that “ Turkey, instead of improving under the constitution, bad grown much worse than in ’Abdul Hamid’s time, and her oppression of the public is such as nobody can bear it.” Agha Nur Ullah seems to intend remaining for some time in ’Iraq; it is said that his life would be in danger if he returned to Persia. He seems to belong to the same category as Mulla Kazim of Najaf, having been in the beginning an out-and-out constitutionalist, and being now inclined to reaction. A political explanation is given of his journey hither, viz., a design of arranging a reconciliation between Mulla Kazim (Khurasani) and Sardar As’ad (Bakhtiyari), between whom a coolness had arisen. 5. It is rumoured that Mirza Mehdi, son of Mulla Kazim (Khurasani), will proceed shortly on a political mission to Southern Persia; but he has not yet started. It is said that his mission will be to the tribes between Shiraz and Isfahan. 6. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Kirmanshah has been good enough to send me a copy of a most interesting and valuable monograph which he has written upon Kurdish tribal politics in his district. The principal feature of the situation is the predominance of the Kalhor tribe under vr . Dawud Khan, who* is at present in revolt against Persian authority and against whom the Persian Governor of Kirmanshah, for lack of funds, is unable to make head. Meanwhile muleteers arriving at Baghdad give lamentable, but possibly exaggerated, accounts of the anarchy prevailing on the high road between Kirmanshah and the Turkish frontier station of Khanaqin. One who visited the Besidency on the 21st of November stated that the Kurds had built small mud forts at short intervals along the road, and that at each of these forts passing caravans were held up by a man with a pointed rifle, who obliged them to pay blackmail. He said that the short journey between Qasr-i-Shirin and Khanaqin alone now T cost 80 Tumans in largesses to tribal Kurds. Last spring, when I passed over this road with Mr. Gaskin, my Commercial Assistant, we rode over part of it in the twilight, almost unattended, and met with no molestation. 7. On the 22nd November, the military guard f for the Turkish Consulate _ at Kirmanshah, consisting of an officer t See tat Summary. VI-6, ^ lg ^ ^ ^ arrival at Qasr-i-Shirin had previously been signalled. I lost no time in communicating the movements of this escort to the principal authorities concerned. It is worth noting that the strength of the Turkish guard is nearly three times that of the British Consular escort at Kirmanshah. The British Consul at Kirmanshah informs me that he has reason to believe that the Turkish Consul there has lately been engaged in intrigues in the neighbourhood. I hope that the despatch of this unnecessarily large guard may not be the precursor of Turkish encroachnents on Persia from Khanaqin, similar to those which have already taken place on the Urumiyah frontier. Such encroach ments, in view of the warlike character of the surrounding tribes, could hardly he made without risk to the Turks, who are not in a position to sustain any serious effort in this direction; but, in view of the arrogant spirit which at present dominates the policy of the local Turkish officials towards Persians generally, almost any act of folly on the part of the former is conceivable. I hesitate to connect this small movement of troops with a curious difficulty which is undoubtedly being experienced by traders at Baghdad in obtaining rebates of customs on goods exported to Persia, though one explanation ofit might he a contemplated forward movement which would bring fresh territory within the Turkish frontier and so do away with rebates on goods consigned to some places at present in Persia. 8. We come now to what is undoubtedly, in the opinion of the very numerous Persians domiciled in ’Iraq, by far the most important question of the hour: a supposed design on the part of the local Turkish authorities of suddenly curtailing their immunities as foreign subjects. The Persians attribute the action of the Turks to the disturbed state of Persia, which precludes all effectual protest by their Government. As the principal evidences of this design they mention the registration of a number of Persians as liable for service in the Turkish army, and the imposition upon Persians at all places of a tax which is described as the ’Amalayah-i-Mukallafah or corvee. I am disposed to think that in the latter case there is some confusion with the * g e e x below Tamattu’ ^ or income-tax, which, as explained in another place, * has recently been ordered to he levied on foreigners of various nationalities besides Persians in Turkey ; but, if so, there must be a wide-spread misunderstanding of the nature of the new taxation at Karbala and Najaf. At Baghdad a general census of Persians and their families has been in progress for some time, but without any assigned object. During the first week of November a large number of Persians at Kufah, and possibly some at Najaf also, appear to have been registered for military service. According to one account even the Persian Mujtahid Mulla Kazim (Khurasani) and his son Mirza Mehdi at Najaf have been urged to show a good example by giving up members of their own families to the Turkish army. The Turkish authorities, apparently, contend that they have not knowingly inscribed any Persian subjects for military service and admit that mistakes may have occurred. At Kufah and Najaf there is a close intermingling of the two races, and the Turkish explanations may therefore be correct; but the Persians do not place the least faith in them, and they assert that in any case the Turks are now claiming as Ottoman subjects all Persians who are either permanently domiciled or possess landed property in the country. On or about the 7th of November, it was understood at Karbala that the Turkish authorities had resolved to collect the *Amalayah-i-Mukallafah from all Persians, whether Turkish subjects or not, at the rate of 12 Gsp. per head per annum, and to demand three years* arrears of the same. On the 8th, a proclamation to this effect was made through public criers, and those liable were informed that they must pay within three days ; but no communica tion on the subject was made to the Persian Consulate. The question of this tax was discussed at Karbala on the 13th November by the Persian Consul and t See paragraph 4 above. Ag* 13 ' Nur Ullah &gt; already mentioned, f m an assembly where the British Vice- Consul was also present. It was agreed that its legality depended on a treatv concluded by Mirza Muhsin Khan, a former Persian Ambassador at Constantinople. No one present seemed to be aware of the exact terms of the treaty; but it was argued by the Persian Consul that at the most it only authorised the recovery from Persian subjects in Turkey of the taxes to which Turkish subjects were liable at the time of signature, and that the *Amalayah-i-Mukallafah was not one of them. It was also stated as a generally accepted fact, that the Turks had lost their copy of the treaty in question, and could not therefore produce proof of their claims if it were required. On the same day the forcible collection of the tax from Persians at Karbala was begun, with threats and heatings. On the 14th some 30 Persians of the Tawairij neighbourhood arrived at Kart ala to protest against the collection from them of the ’Amalayah-i-Makallafah ; but on the 17th they weie told by the Mutasarrif that he could not receive any representations on the subject, and that they must pay. 9. On or about the 1st November, the Mutasarrif of Karbala seems to have received an order that all schools in his jurisdiction of which the existence had not been authorised by the Turkish Central Government must be closed at once, and that they must not be reopened without permission. This orderA i criers, aails !;ktiocoiB .13 implies the closure of all the Shi’ah schools which have from time immemorial been held by Persians in the sacred shrines, as well as of the secular schools that have lately been established in the town by various Persian Anjumans. On the 16th November, notice was given to the managers of all religious Madrasahs at Najaf that they must obtain sanction for the continuance of their institutions from Constantinople within 10 days, otherwise the Turkish Government would take possession of them and manage them in its own way. This notice was issued by the Qaim-Maqam through the Commissaire of Police. It is thought that the object of the order is partly to depress Shi’ah influence, at present paramount, and to secure a valuable escheat to the Turkish Auqaf *« rr TV n *-,nnn , Department. I visited one * of the Najaf * See my Tour Diary No. 1 of 1909 under date H/rAl i ix 19 th December. Madrasahs last year, which had then lately been completed at a cost of some £ T. 12,000. The British Vice-Consul at Karbala remarks : —“ These cases mean hindrances in the way of Shi’ah learning, and a complete ruin of the Mujtahids’ name and position.” Such will no doubt be the outcome, if the threatened measures are carried into effect at Karbala and Najaf and permission to re-open the schools is withheld. 10. The cumulative effect of the occurrences described above has been to produce something like a panic in the Persian community, especially at Najaf. In regard to the military conscription, some of those affected telegraphed at once for help to the Persian Embassy at Constantinople, but in reply they were referred to the Persian Consulate-General at Baghdad, which can do nothing. The political Mujtahids Mulla Kazim and Shaikh ’Abdullah of course sent various telegrams on the subject of the conscription and the ’Amalayah-i- Makallafah to what they considered the proper quarters; and even Saiyid Muhammad Kazim (Tabatabayi, Yazdi), the greatest of the Najaf Mujtahids, who has not since I came to Baghdad taken any part in political affairs, telegraphed to the Persian Ambassador at Constantinople and to the Persian Eoreign Minister at Tehran, begging them to take precautions against a wholesale conversion of Persians into Turkish subjects. About the 24th of November the Persians of Najaf seem to have made a general request to the Mujtahids to abstain from conducting public prayers so long as the Turkish menaces continued; but it is not clear whether the suggestion was adopted. Saiyid Muhammad Kazim (Yazdi) is credited with an intention of emigrating from Najaf to Muhammarah in Persia. The Arab tribes around Najaf, who .are Shi’ahs, are said to regard the probability that Najaf will be shorn of some of its glories with anything but equanimity. 11. Various overtures have been made to the British Vice-Consul at Karbala with a view to ascertaining whether Persians can in any way place themselves under British protection. One of the enquirers was a well-known merchant of Najaf, and he professed to speak for all the leading Persian merchants at that place. He intimated that, if his proposals were not enter tained by the British Consul-General at Baghdad, the Russian Consulate at Baghdad would be approached. I told Mr. Muhammad Hasan Mohsin to reply, in effect, that British nationality could not be conferred on persons who had no claim to it, under the British law, by place of birth, parentage or naturalisation. 12. On the 30th of November a significant incident occurred near Kadhimain. Pilgrims from Persia are at present prohibited, under the quarantine rules of the Wilayat, from entering Kadhimain on arrival, and are segregated in a special caravansarai. A pilgrim who had finished his quaran tine and was living in the town had gone to draw water from the river near the Mu’adhdham bridge; and, in returning to his lodging, he imprudently attached himself to a pilgrim caravan then arriving from Persia. When he attempted to leave the caravan, a gendarme or soldier of the sanitary escort prevented him and struck him with the butt of his rifle, which the Persian immediately grasped to prevent a repetition of the blow. A Gendarmerie officer, coming up and finding the two men in this attitude, tired two shots 2018 F. D.from his revolver into the Persian without enquiry. The latter has since died of his wounds. This is only a symptom of the truculent spirit which the Local Government appear to be fostering in their subordinates, and further manifestations will probably not long be wanting. 13. The newspaper * “ Najaf,” published in the town of the same name, * See Summary for August, VI—5. which had reappeared, is said to have been suppressed for the second time. The reason is not known. IT. It is stated here that one Muntakhab-al-Mulk has been appointed to t See Summary for July, vii — 9. the vacant f Persian Consulate-General at Baghdad. No one will envy him the position. VII.— Central Arabian Affairs. 1. The Amir of Hail has dismissed Jar Ullah-ad-Dakhil, f his agent j See Summary for June, vii— i. ^ Baghdad, who is said to have been m . g ui % of embezzling part of the Amir’s allowances from the Turkish Government. The Amir is said to have appointed one Ibn Bassam, who is at Damascus, to represent him in future, but whether at Damascus or at Baghdad is not yet known. 2. The news § of an attack by’Anizah on a Jabal Sham mar Hadrah § See last Summary, vii 3. descending to IMesopotamia proves to be . t untrue. It was probably circulated by enemies of the Amir of Hail in order to discourage pilgrims to Makkah from accepting the protection of the Hadrah on their journey across Arabia. The Hadrah eventually came in at Najaf, where the leader of it, Ibrahim, represent ing the Amir of Hail, gave written guarantees for the safety and good treatment of the pilgrims who might accompany him to the Turkish Qaim-Maqam and to the Mujtahids Saiyid Kazim (Yazdi) and Mulla Kazim (Khurasani) The Hamlahdars or pilgrim transport agents of Najaf accordingly entered into agreements with him^ and handed over to him some 300 pilgrims, of whom about half were Persians and half were local Arabs. The Hamlahdars of Kadhimain however held back, alleging want of confidence. The caravan left Najaf for Makkah on the 13th November under the “ Amir-al-Hajj ” Ibrahim. This ^ is the first time for some years, I believe, that escort arrangements for pilgrims from Mesopotamia to Hijaz have been organised by Ibn Bashid. There was formerly an annual caravan protected by him, but it fell into desuetude during the late prolonged warfare in Najd between his house and that of Ibn Sa ud. 3. It is stated at Baghdad that the Sharif of Makkah lately visited Qasim and exhorted Ibn Bashid and Ibn Sa’ud to agree between themselves after which the fomer Amir departed to Hail and the latter to Biyaclh. It is added that the Sharif succeeded in obtaining the allegiance bai’at ”) of the district of Qasim for himself. This news goes considerably beyond the information received by the British Political Agent at Kuwait, and to the extent to which it does so is probably incorrect. I only mention the rumours because they are current at 4. The general position || in Najd, according to the information obtainable I! See Summary fo r June ,vn-2, and that f °r July, h^ 6 ’ !S UOW as follows. There is an vii 2 and 3. entente between the Amir of Hail and the fEo A ; r -n- n -r, „ , . Sh aikh of Kuwait, partly directed against the Amir of Riyadh. Ibn Sa ud is losing ground in consequence of this combination and of the dissensions which have broken out in his family. Ibn B ashid is still gaining ground ; but Jauf and Sakakah, wrested from him by the Buwalah Anizah, still remain in the possession of that tribe.15 VIII. —British Interests and Cases. 1. Undeterred by protests, the Local Goyernment have now carried out *See last Summary, viii_i. a further instalment of,their programme * ■ . . . of wrongful demolition and fraudulent expropriation of buildings belonging to British subjects at Baghdad. On the 7th of November the dismantling of the front part of Mr. G. Thaddeus’s shop was begun : it is now completed. On the 11th and 12th November part of the house of the widow of the late Nawab Ahmad ’Ali Khan was demolised. In this case the Wali called upon me, in peremptory terms, to detail a Dragoman to be present at the opera tions and look after any moveables that might be found; but I replied that I could not participate in the proceedings unless some guarantee as to compensa tion were given, and must leave the Turkish authorities to bear tbe whole responsibility themselves. I am informed that His Excellency showed much irritation at this reply and issued orders for the building to be destroyed with the utmost violence, and these were carried out with such energy that even a house on the opposite side of the street suffered in the process. I duly reported the above events by telegram to the proper quarters. On the 13th of ^ November Messrs. Lynch’s Baghdad manager received notice of the expropriation of the main offices and warehouse of his firm, to a depth of 3J metres, at a valuation of £ T. 423. It will be remembered that the Wilayat had previously tried to induce Mr. Parry to settle with them on compensation of £ T. 200 only; and even the sum now assessed will apparently cover less than one-fifth of the loss which Messrs. Lynch are likely to suffer. On the 29th of November, on the expiry of the legal period, the demolition of Messrs. Lynch’s buildings was begun by the Turkish authorities,. As the houses on the opposite side had already been pulled down, the street could very easily have been widened without disturbing Messrs. Lynch at all. There are still other buildings at Baghdad owned by British subjects, por tions of which the Turkish authorities mean to expropriate; and there is little doubt that the terms offered will be equally ridiculous and unjust. A regrettable feature of the operations, in view of the great damage to house property which they entail, is that the width now being added to the street is inconsiderable and will leave it still narrow and inconvenient. In compliance with a despatch from His Excellency the British Ambas sador at Constantinople, dated the 23rd October, I am now submitting detailed estimates of the damage so far done to the immoveable property of British subjects at Baghdad, Kadhimain, and Karbala. (2) In the course of the month it came to my knowledge that the Wali was discussing the possibility of prohibiting the Euphrates &amp; Tigris S. N. Coy’s steamers from towing barges, also that of obliging Messrs. Lynch to close their wool-press in the town on some sanitary pretext. The barges carry much more cargo than the steamers themselves, and their suppression would be a heavy blow to the owners’ business besides improving the position of the Turkish steamer line, which would of course continue to use barges. As a precaution against sudden interference in both these matters, I communicated my information by telegram to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. 3. At the beginning of November the Euphrates &amp; Tigris S. N. Coy.’s new steamer “ Julnar ” having broken down, the Turkish autho- t See Summary of July, VIII—4. I*!? 8 ^ . BaS “ h attempted, as it Was indicated in a former report f that they would, to prevent the temporary substitution of the old steamer “ Blosse Lynch.” Beferences to Constantinople, however, resulted in their opposition being withdrawn ; and the “ Blosse Lynch ” has since been running instead of the “ Julnar.”4. In the case * of the Indian, Saiyid Muhammad, who was maltreated by the Turkish police, the Wali has now replied to my letter, denying all the facts alleged. * See Summary for September, VIII—4. Meanwhile the Bidayat Criminal Court at Baghdad have irregularly condemned the man in the absence of a British representative and even of the accused himself, to six months’ imprisonment, at the same time acquitting a female Turkish subject who was originally charged as the principal offender. The Court have sent me a copy of their judgment for service on Saiyid Muhammad, but I have declined to comply; and in order to prevent the man’s re-arrest, liberation from which it would probably be impossible to obtain without great delay, I have allowed him to take asylum in the Besidency precincts. A detailed report of the case has now been submitted to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and copies have been sent to the Government of India. 5. There seems to be a disposition on the part of the Local Government to consider whether the Turkish conscription laws cannot he applied to British Indian subjects in ’Iraq in the same manner as it appears to be their intention to enforce it on certain classes of Persians. I have received a complaint in this connection on behalf of some British Indians resident at Samarrah; and I am told that the Wall lately took advice as to whether he could compel some young members of the Indian families at Baghdad who have recently objected to the pulling down of their houses to perform military service, but that the opinion of those whom he consulted was adverse. 6. The troops in the New Camp are now exercised in musketry on Sunday afternoons at the time at which it has been the custom for members of the British community to play golf in the desert behind the butts, on the only links available at Baghdad. The new arrangement is believed to have been made intentionally in order to deprive our people of their weekly amusement; and, whether this is or is not the case, it seems useless in the present state of feeling here to raise the subject with the military authorities. It has also reached me, through the German Consulate, that there is a proposal to divert the improved street at Baghdad in such a manner as to carry it through the grounds of the British Club (a hired building), and so perma nently abolish its two tennis courts. This change would save the house occupied by the German Consul; but it would render superfluous the demoli tion, already carried out, of two British properties (the Iqbal-ud-Daulah house and part of Messrs. Lynch’s premises). The modification, however, does not seem to be intended as a favour to Germany ; for the • ■ German Garden,” also is now apparently about to he cut into for the second time.t t See Summary for August, X—3. At a distanpe such matters may appear trivial, but they are vexatious to those who are personally affected by them. 7. The proceedings { against Mr. Moynihan have evidently not been t See Summary for September, ix — 7 . dropped. On the 13th November he was obliged to appear before the Mustantiq or Examining Magistrate. He was accompanied by the First Dragoman of this Consulate-General and his statement was recorded. The real adversary of the Liquorice Company in these proceedings is ’Abdul Qadir Pasha (Khadhairi), § See last Summary, V-17. iS ^ in ^VOUT with the Wall: and, should the case eventually come into court, it will not be surprising if a finding of guilty and a vindictive sentence are the result, in the first instance. 8. Miss Feilding || and Miss Green were unable, to prosecute their journey II See last Summary, VIII-7. to Aleppo in consequence of cholera and Turkish quarantine arrangements. They left Baghdad for Karachi en route for Europe, on the 13th of November,17 iiie, tt tbss liiif), d so j» foil saic If l® i 9. Nawab Saiyid Muhammad * of Madras, a member of His Excellency the Viceroy of India’s Council, started from Baghdad on the 15th of November on , c _ x o ttttt o his return voyage to India. He was * See last Summary, VIII—8. • i i ^ cn i jxti ci • * j accompanied by Shams-ul- Ulama feaiyid Hasan Biza, late Government Kazi for the Shi’ah Community of the Town of Madras, who had under his care some Indian orphans repatriated * at the expense of the Charitable Committee at Karbala connected with the Oudh Bequest. 1(X Hr. Wenyon f of the London School of Tropical Medicine, who came here in March to study the Baghdad boil, f See Summary for March, IX—4. i pj r* n i i x it „ has now lelt for England, travelling over land. He was to spend a few days at Musal by the way. The results of his research work at Baghdad are negative, and the vehicle or means of diffusion of the boil remains as much of a mystery as ever. Hr. Wenyon has until him as a travelling companion Mr, F. Langridge, a British merchant of Baghdad, whose wife and sister-in-law recently perished in the loss of the “ Kurdistan.” IX.— British official matters. 1. Colonel Whyte, I commanding the 117th Mahrattas, arrived at Baghdad on the 7th of November with Lieutenant 1 See last Summaiy ’ IX — 9 - jjgjj an q a native officer of the same regiment. He came, under orders from the superior military authorities in India, to hold an enquiry into the cases of Private Saiyid Jan Muhammad and Private Fazil Khan, whom he brought back with him from Jashk. I am glad to report that the result of his investigations has been to exonerate Subahdar Miandin Khan, commanding the Besidency Guard detachment, of blame; but the evidence of insubordination against the two men is not clear enough to admit of their being court-martialled. Colonel Whyte and his party left Baghdad again on the 13th November taking the two accused away with them ; and it seems improbable that there will be any further trouble among the Guard. 2. Certain reductions which I had recommended in the Besidency estab lishment have been sanctioned by the Government of India. The services of two clerks are being dispensed with, and the number of horses in the Besident’s mounted escort (for tours, etc.) is being tentatively reduced from 6 to I. I have suggested a further reduction of two Qawwases. 3. A very moderately worded letter from the “ Ittihad-i-’Ilmiyah,” evidently a Persian association at Karbala, has reached me, in which the writers ask to be informed whether any money from the Oudh Bequest is to be made available for purposes of charity. The letter concludes with the words :— “It is well-known that the policy of your Government is to defend the poor and the weak, and we hope that you will not fail them in your support.” I believe that any reorganisation or modification of the present arrangements which the Government of India may see fit to approve will be greatly facili tated by the general confidence which undoubtedly exists, out side the domain of politics, in the benevolence and good intentions of the British. As it has been intimated to me that orders on the subject of the Oudh Bequest will shortly be issued by the Government of India, I have not for the present sent any reply to the Persian association. 1. Shortly after the middle of November a British Indian military surveyor returning from Kirmanshah to India passed through Baghdad. I was careful to arrange with the Wilayat, before the man’s arrival at the Turkish station of Khanaqin, for his being allowed to pass with his British military rifle and ammunition, and he met with no inconvenience at the frontier. Shortly before reaching Baghdad, however, he was stopped at a Gendarmerie post and his rifle taken from him, nor was the latter recovered without some trouble. The surveyor, Havaldar Inzar Gul of the 58th Bifles, arrived at Baghdad on the 18th of November and left for India on the 28th November. 2018 F. I).&lt; 18 Baghdad 5. On the 23rd of November a request was received from the , „ . , 0 TV „ Municipality for the name of the certified dispenser ^ lately engaged by Captain McPherson, I.M.S., and it was supplied. Dr. Johnson, the Church Missionary Society’s representative, is delaying to comply with my advice that he should make an arrangement similar to Captain McPherson’s ; and I have been obliged to warn him that, if he pro crastinates any longer, I cannot be responsible for unpleasant consequences to the mission, which may interfere with its usefulness. 6. The editor of the late “ Baqib ” newspaper, an Arabic speaking Muhammadan named ’Abdul Latif Thinaiyan, unexpectedly called on me about the beginning of November. His object was manifestly to sound me about British cases against the Wilayat, but I abstained from affording him any real information. He has since disappeared from Baghdad, and an advertisement requesting information about him on the part of his friends has appeared in the “ Biyadh ” newspaper. The Wali’s emissaries are also in search of him. 7. Jalal Bey, Ottoman Consul-General at Bombay, arrived at Baghdad on the 18th November and is still here. The professed object of his visit is pleasure. He is accompanied by an Indian merchant, Mr. Karimbhoy Adamjee Peerbhoy, who has come partly on business and partly to perform the Shi’ah pilgrimage, and who is, I am told, his landlord at Bombay. Jalal Bey speaks English unusually well for a Turk, and I understand that his wife is an American lady. His official career began in London in 1891 and he remained six years in England, since which he has been posted for a time at Tehran. His present age appears to be about 45. He has now spent two years at Bombay, but he does not like the climate, and is trying to obtain a transfer. According to Jalal Bey the late Wali of Basrah is a friend of his; and, when Sulaiman Nazif Bey passed through Bombay lately, after his resig- t See last Summary, iv—i. nation .t or dismissal, Jalal Bey returned from a journey to the Himalayas in order to meet with him. Perhaps on account of this connection Nazim Pasha did not accord Jalal Bey a very hospitable reception at Baghdad, but merely placed a room and bed in the Sarai at his disposal. Jalal Bey called on me on j See xi— i below. the 21st of November with Major Najib Bey4 who had then just returned from India, but in a different steamer. On the 23rd he dined at the Besidency, and on this occasion he mentioned that he had lost heavily at the Bombay races through backing a horse which had been recommended to him by an Arab horse-dealer. I knew, before meeting him, that Jalal Bey was one of the authors of a report addressed to the Turkish Government some time ago from their Consulate-General at Bombay, in which it was recommended that Turkey should subsidise some of the Arab Shaikhs in the Persian Gulf and generally adopt a more active policy there. I do not think that any importance need be attached to that report, at least if the joint author was as ignorant of the Gulf as Jalal Bey, who seems now to have visited it for the first time. Is it too far-fetched to imagine that the subsidies scheme may have been suggested to Jalal Hey by his horse-dealing friends, Turkish subjects, with interested motives ? Jalal Bey talks of visiting Karbala and Najaf, and I have ordered the British Vice-Consul there to keep a look out for him. 8. Jalal Bey told me that Veisi Bey,§ the Turkish official who was sent to § See summary for February, V- 7 . Baghdad and Basrah some months ago to j # improve the working of the local Customs nouses, entirely wasted the time which he spent at Bombay. He assured me thdo V eisi Bey s not havin g benefited by some Bombay introductions given him a ' Baghdad was his own fault, and that the officials to whom the letters were addressed were not to blame. About the middle of the month 1 received an invitation from Colonel Biz a Bey, Chief of the Staff, to ride out with him one day and see the NewCamp buildings, which are nearly finished. I replied that in view of some cases pending with the Wilayat, my action in going might be misconstrued by some British subjects at Baghdad, and that I therefore begged to decline his kind invitation for the present. A little after this Agha Taqi Khan, a British Indian gentleman, part of whose house is being expropriated on derisory compensation, was asked by Colonel Riza Bey and others to meet them at a military club and help them to organise horse races which the Wali intends to hold at the Bairam. Agha Taqi, before complying, came to ask my advice. Binding that he was disinclined to help, 1 told him that I saw no reason why he should do so, and he subsequently sent an excuse for not attending the meeting. The Turks here seem to be under the mistaken impression that they can persecute British subjects as they please and still utilise their services and the friendly offices of British officials. The subjects and representatives of powers such as Persia may find it expedient to kiss the rod and look pleasant, but in our case such submission would be impolitic as well as degrading. Until repara tion is made for the numerous injuries already inflicted on British subjects, it would be a mistake, in my opinion, to show more than strict correctness’ in official dealings, or to allow any appearance of intimacy in social matters, with the Turks. X.— Foreign interests and cases (other than Persian and British). 1. The Austrian Cbnsul at Baghdad does not seem to have been so success- * See Summary for August, X— 1 . ^ ^ ^ ^ fiist Supposed * in obtaining redress for his subject M. Svoboda. The latter’s shop is now open; but the cases of revolvers and ammunition there, placed under embargo by the Turkish police, still remain sealed. Also a new explanation of the removal of the Chief of Police at Baghdad, is given in the “ Maqtabas ” newspaper (Damascus) of the 15th October, though M. Xanthopoulo, I understand, still claims the credit of having obtained Hamdi Bey’s dismissal. According to the “ Maqtabas ” Hamdi Bey was obliged to resign because he had urged Nazim Pasha to dismiss his butler and confidential adviser Suren, who had caused an ex-Head Inspector of the Baghdad Munici pality to be beaten. If this is true, it is a pity ; for M. Svoboda’s was the only case in which it seemed that a European Consul had succeeded in obtain ing satisfaction from the present Uocal bovernment for an act of aggression against one of his subjects. 2. A German named Clasen is now at Baghdad, where he arrived some three weeks ago. He came from the Persian Gulf ; and he represents a firm interested in the arms trade, whose business ha* hitherto been chiefly in Syria. The name of the firm I have not yet been able to learn. Mr. Clasen tells me that the order against importing revolvers with barrels longer than 15 cent^ metres into Turkey has greatly prejudiced the interests of his principals. 3. A German archaeologist,f name not yet ascertained, has suddenly t Dr. Herzfeid, a Privat nozent at Berlin Univer. arrived at Baghdad to undertake excava- *ity. He is also a Lieutenant in the German Army. ^ Samarrah. He Was employed here before, some years ago. His return is admittedly due to the recent proceedings of the Frenchman M. Viollet, who with the permission of the Wali of Baghdad i See Summary for September, x~3. made some $ experimental excavations at the Samarrah sites last summer. 4. Mr. Bicharz, a German gentleman of independent means, who has resided at Baghdad for a number of years, left for Berlin towards the end of October. Before the establishment of a regular German Consulate at Baghdad Mr. Bicharz was Honorary German Consul here, and ever since his superses sion he has been trying to obtain another official appointment. With this object he has been cultivating the good graces of Nazim Pasha ; and I fear that there have been intrigues, on the part of his supporters in the German com munity, against Dr. Hesse, the present German Consul. Dr. Hesse has lately been confirmed in his appointment, and this may be the explanation of Mr. Bicharz’s unexpected journey.20 Mr. Richarz’s tent was visited by Arab thieves one night before he had gone far on the road to Aleppo, and he lost some clothes and a letter of credit. The Wall telegraphed after Mr. Richarz that he wished to occupv his house during his absence and enquired the rent; and Mr. Richarz replied as was no doubt expected of him, that he would be honoured by ’His Excellency s occupying the house and that there could be no question of pay- ment. When the Wall’s establishment arrived and installed themselves wvu J A CliarZ s . h ? rses were turned out into the street and left to wander there! With the permission of Dr. Johnson, who did not like to refuse it, His Excel lency has also taken possession of some stables belonging to the Church Missionary Society’s house, which is next door to Mr. Richarz’s. AT or{ t er was received from Constantinople about the beginning of November authorising the admission of Persian, Indian and Afghan children ^ ^ overnrneilt schools, in which instruction is given gratis. Hitherto, though Muhammadans, they have been excluded as foreign subjects. 6 . Instructions have been received at Baghdad to collect Tamattu’, a new tax somewhat resembling an income tax, from Turkish subjects and also from persons of Greek, Roumanian, Bulgarian, Servian, Montenegrin and Persian nationality. The rates range from Gsp. 5,000 per annum for a banker or w io esale merchant in the highest class to Gsp. 5 for a donkey-man possessing only one donkey. Certain clsisses and professions are exempt. It seems not improbable that this is the tax which is being collected * from * See vi—s above. Persians at Karbala under the name of ’Amalayah-i-Mukallafah. At Baghdad, on the 20th of November, an enumeration was made bv the Turkish authorities of tie Persian Kurds in the ’Awainah and Sadriyah quarters, and the latter were informed that they would have to pay “ Wairffu ” m future at the rate of £.T. i per family a year. This also is perhapsThe lamattu under another name. The Kurds sent a deputation to the Persian Consulate-General and offered to pay for telegrams of remonstrance to be sent to the Persian Ambassador at Constantinople and the Persian Foreign Minister at Tehran, but the Acting Consul-General declined to take any action. XI.~ Commercial Matters. 1. Major Najib Bey f returned from India on the 15th of November and t See last Summary, xi-- 5 , came to see me on the 21st. He had TnrV KVp ho Lori -i• i,7 , „ evidently enjoyed his tour in India ; but a. R L 6 ’ ^e had very little k) say for himself; and almost the only topic on which he spoke with animation was a dinner in the mess of the Gordon High landers at Cawnpore, at which he was present and His Majesty the Sultan’s health was drunk He said that the Indian military equipment was good, but too expensive for Die purposes of this Army Corps ; he had, however, profited leathered Zm ^ Go ^n m ent telegraphic apparatus at’Calcutta. •Rrittii 1 n consequence of tie difficulty mentioned last month about a ±5utish othcer attending military manoeuvres in Turkey, Najib Bey had been unable to wear his uniform while in India.

U ; and he latel y wrotf ‘ from Constantinople not seem 1 to ? ag ldad tll at the grant of his concession by Nazim Pasha did relationswith the p Cogmsed as ae Ce “ tr al Government. The Wali’s relations with the Government, he added, appeared to be in a critical state. -RnA a .i “ ference from the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade I am now, with the help of an experienced British merchant § See summary for July, xi—u. here, going carefully into the question § in fnv™ +• x , of telephones at Baghdad. It is difficult form an estimate of the number of persons who might be expected to avail/ 21 themselves of telephonic facilities, or to determine the maximum annual charge which they would be willing to pay. Enquiry into these points will take some time; and a fterwards, if the results are favourable, the question of probable cost of installation and working can be taken up. 4. Mr. S. Aratoon, representing the Cawnpore Woollen Mills Company, . See Summary for Augu.t, xi- 4 . India who arrived * here in August, has opened an agency of his firm at Baghdad which ^ it is intended to maintain experimentally for one year. The original intention was to obtain wholesale orders; but, having begun work too late in the season, Mr. Aratoon is now disposing of his present stock retail at Indian wholesale prices, plus 15 per cent, to cover freight and customs duty. He has already sold off in this manner about two-thirds of the miscellaneous assortment of goods, worth Bs. 6,000 (£ 400), which he brought with him. The Company’s ordinary cloths seem to find favour, the prices being gene rally moderate; but their flannel shirtings are too high-class and expensive, and the well-known Baghdad prejudice against rough-surfaced cloths is illus trated hy the unsaleableness of their rough cheviots, homespuns, serges and broadcloth. As there is a considerable and increasing demand for European clothing at £. T. 2 to £. T. 3 a suit, Mr. Aratoon has suggested to his principals that they should open a tailoring department with a view to promoting the sale of their cloth. 5. Mr. Bryce of Messrs. Hoar &amp; Co., tailors and Outfitters, Bombay, arrived at Baghdad on the 18th of November, to prospect for a business opening, and remaiced for some days. The same steamer brought to Baghdad the European traveller of another firm of Bombay tailors. Mr. Bryce told me in confidence that a Jew here had offered to enter into partnership with him; supplying a capital of Rs. 60,000, if he would open a shop here; also that he and his rival from Bombay had between them taken orders in the course of a few days for no less than 100 good suits and 200 cheap ones. Mr. Bryce said that Messrs. Hoar’s English stuffs were both better and cheaper than the Indian manufactures of the Cawnpore Woollen Mills, and that the latter would not be able to compete. XII.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. The cholera epidemic f which began in ’Iraq at the middle of October decreased during November, and at the t see last Summary, xii— i. end of that month it appeared to be practically at an end. Baghdad and -Beginning on the 5th of November, there was a sudden decline in the number of seizures and deaths at Baghdad and Kadhimain, and after that day only a few cases occurred. Emm the com mencement of the epidemic to the 27th of November inclusive the number of deaths from cholera at the two places was 294. The principal measure adopted by the Turkish authorities for prevent ing the spread of the disease was the isolation of infected places, with the persons who happened to be in them, by means of “cordon:” this meant, generally, the placing of sentries over houses in which cases had occurred, whereby the inmates were prevented from coming out or holding any communication with the external world during five days. The residents in the Hotel where Mr. Lapham died, narrowly escaped this fate by a delay in the arrival of the Turkish guard; but Hrs. Johnson and Stanley of the Church Missionary Society were immured in their house, and their dispensary in the town was closed, in consequence of their having attended a cholera patient. The “ cordon ” was maintained in their case for more than the regulation period of 5 days, I believe through pure inadvertence, and steps had to be taken by me to get it removed. The isolation of medical men at a time when their services are most required seems indefensible : and, if the principle were to be consistently acted on in a severe epidemic, the community would soon be 2018 F. D.22 without medical aid of any sort. I am told that Dr. Harle, a German physician at Baghdad, was deterred from entering an infected house in the course of his duty by an intimation that, if he did, he would not be allowed to come out again. At Kadhimain the oppressions practised in connection with the “ cordon ” were such, I was informed by a respectable Indian resident, as he had not before witnessed during a 40 years’ sojourn in this country. He said that every family of which a member was ailing, whatever the disease and of however old standing, had to pay a bribe to the medical inspectors, otherwise the case was declared cholera and they were imprisoned in their house. There were during the month a few dropping cases, in some instances among Persian pilgrims, at Khanaqin and Ba’qubah on the high road from Persia to Baghdad. Basrah. On the 22nd of November and the three following days there were no cases of cholera at Basrah. The total cholera mortality there un to the date mentioned was 235. ^ At Basrah pilgrims arriving from India in good health, but liable to detention as coming from a plague infected country, were forced, on landing, into a cholera infected and in every way insanitary quarantine station, where a number of them contracted the disease and 32 died of it. I reported the matter by telegram to the Government of India on the 21st of November, the proper authorities at Constantinople having already been informed of it hv His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah; and tardy steps were in the end taken for rectifying the deplorable mismanagement. I regret that owing to faulty transmission of a telegram sent by Mr. Crow I represented the number ot Indian casualties as 82 instead of 32. The Tigris. * During November there was cholera between Baghdad and Matters under this head are treated in detail as -jp aSra h at Amarah and Qumah. Thirty they may have formed the subject of complaints by deaths from the disease in the town nf the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company ’Arrmynh wpua 1 a 1 to • ji to His Majesty’s Government. -rx mar an were reported, also 12 in the neighbourhood, and three at Qurnah. The sanitary measures affecting river steamers on the Tigris, designed to protect places between Baghdad and Basrah, were those which most obtruded themselves on European notice. On the 2nd November the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company s steamer Mejidieh, having had three cholera deaths on board on er upward journey after passing Kut, was stopped at Qararah some miles below Baghdad. Dr Hesse, German Consul, and his wife, who were on boar! escaped from the vessel along with Sirop Effendi, the manager of the Idarah Nahnyah, m a boat belonging to the Turkish steamer “ Burhaniyah ® on arrival at Baghdad the two former were placed in quarantine in the German Consulate. No information could he obtained as to how the cargo and the other passengers were to be disposed of, and the sending of lighter vessels from Baghdad by the Company’s manager proved a waste of money as they were not allowed to approach the ship. In the afternoon I visited the Wall at the Sarai along wHh Captain McPherson, the Residency ^rgeon and dLcnssed matters with His Excellency, Colonel Bessim Bey, Dr Ramy, and Eram BeJ t See III —4 above. the Political Secretary of the Wilayat. doctor and President of a special SantorfchilTssiof which Ihe^Walf S constituted to deal with the situation: Dr Rnmv fin ila ? Baghdad of the Constantinople Sanitary Board. It was at length pro^iseeT by the Wah, who appeared personally unable to follow the discussion that the passengers on the “ Mejidieh ” would be disembarked at the QaZah quarantine station and that the steamer herself would be allowed to come to Baghdad in quarantine to discharge and load cargo there. In the evening I rode with m:ltiL M t We e ter“th ° 1° ^ of the existeLe of accTm- modatiou there for the reception of passengers, and to enquire whether the hadnot/ 11 had received ail y orders about the “ Mejidieh,” but he , . tbe of November, hearing that some of the “ Meiidieh ” nassenp-p™— not British subjects-refused to land at Qararah and that military force was23 about to be used, I sent the Residency Second Dragoman to watch the interests of the Indian pilgrims on board. He was able to report on his return that the disembarkation had been effected without difficulty so far as the Indians were concerned, and that their wants were sufficiently provided for in the camp. ^ The “ Mejidieh ” continuing to be detained at Qararah, however, and no British mail having been received for a fortnight, I wired to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople explaining the circumstances and suggesting that medical inspection should be substituted for quarantines. O nthe4th of November the “Mejidieh” was allowed to proceed to Baghdad, but a “ cordon ” was placed round her, and it was not till the next day that arrangements were made for her working cargo. . Meanwhile on the 3rd November an order had been issued by the Wali’s Sanitary Commission forbidding the coaling of steamers at Kut and ’Amarah, though the existence of cholera at ’Amarah had already been officially notified, and though it was evident that coaling operations at those places could be conducted in quarantine as safely as the working of cargo at Baghdad which was permitted. The matter was of importance to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, as, if their steamers carried coal for the whole voyage, they could not take much cargo ; and goods traffic was already congested at Baghdad and Basrah. An official letter addressed by me to the Wilayat resulted in the withdrawal eventually of the illogical restriction. On the 6th of November a set of quarantine regulations for the river was issued by the Baghdad Sanitary Commission, providing for the working of cargo in quarantine at Baghdad and Basrah, and for the deduction of the days of the voyage, in the absence of cholera cases on board, from the regulation period of five days. The latter of these two concessions practically did away with the necessity for detention altogether at the end of the voyage. On the 7th of November the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s “ Khalifah ” steamer with a clean bill of health and a number of * See v —15 above. European passengers on board also the Deputy * Ismail Haqqi Bey, arrived at hjararah and she might have reached Baghdad the same night but pratique was refused on the absurd ground of her having touched at Kut, a place admittedly uninfected. The next day she was allowed to come up to Baghdad but the passengers, though provisions on board were exhausted, were still prevented from landing. On the morning of the 9th the Harbour-master of Baghdad wearing a fine uniform, put off in a boat apparently to inspect the ship : but derisive howls of “Jackal ” from the native passengers, and from a crowd which had assembled on shore, so abashed him that he beat a hasty retreat. No one was more annoyed by his imprisonment than the Deputy Ismail Haqqi Bey, who, I am informed, wrote in strong terms to Nazim Pasha besides regretting publicly that the Wall should himself be a laughing stock to foreigners by his quarantines. The passengers were at length released by order of the Wali, who happened to pass in a launch on his way to the Sabai and was hailed with complaints of starvation. After this there was great difficulty in ascertaining under what conditions passengers could safely be accepted by the “Khalifah” for her downward voyage; and though Mr. Parry and I both wrote to the authorities, at first only unsntisfactory verbal replies were forthcoming. In the end it was announced that passengers might embark freely at Baghdad. At Baghdad the worst trouble was not from the delays which actually occurred, but from the impossiblity of knowing what might not be made a reason for putting a steamer in quarantine for five days, with loss to her owners and^ disorganisation of cargo and mail services, or for throwing passengers into some camp of cholera stricken hovels to the danger of their lives. On the 8th of November I learned, in reply to my telegram of the 3rd that the internal quarantines in Mesopotamia were the work of the Wali himself and had not been sanctioned by the Constantinople Sanitary Board Orders were then being sent the Wali by the Civil Medical Council at24 Constantinople to substitute medical inspections for quarantines; but up to the end of the month, so far as I can ascertain, five days’ quarantine con tinued to be enforced between Baghdad and Basrah. Karbala and Najaf .—Cholera appeared at Karbala on the 1 6th November and 56 deaths from the disease were reported there before the end of the month, when it gave signs of ceasing. There were two seizures at Kallujah in the Euphrates valley above Karbala a station on the Baghdad-Aleppo road, on the 4th of November. In the Euphrates valley below Karbala there were 16 deaths at Shamiyah betwppn the 13th and the 22nd. Seventeen deaths were registered between the 16th and the 23rd at Mahmudiyah on the Baghdad-Karbala road, which had been converted into a quarantine station for the protection of Karbala against Baghdad Mr. Tahor, one of Sir William Willcock’s engineers, was detained at Mahmudiyah for five days from the 21st and wrote a lamentable account of the arrangements there to a friend at Baghdad. The state of the place was in describably filthy ; and I learn from another informant that there was only one well, and that pilgrims had to pay the equivalent of four pence for a drink of water. On the 31st of October before the appearance of the cholera at Karbala it was proclaimed in the town by criers, evidently with a view to settling the difficulty which had arisen over post-mortems, and perhaps also as a means of increasing the income of the only recognised physician, that “the municipality doctor has agreed to visit patients once free of charge in order to diagnose their illness and then make no further inspection when they are dead. Eor subsequent visits 1 if he were called upon, he will charge them his usual fee viz ’ one Mejidi per visit. The object of this proclamation is to leave no place for complaint to those who regard the inspection of the dead as against religion and honour” (British Vice-Consul Karbala). * The following extracts from the diary of the British Vice-Consul * •It should be mentioned that Mirza Muhammad Hasan Karbala describe the COUTSC at of Mohsin lately lost his only son, a child, through what he events nn onrl ^ 'h believes to have been mistaken treatment by the Turkish . 031 ail(1 a tt6r the day that municipal doctor at Karbala.

He wanted to carry out this small arrangement by contribution, and in order to obtain for them free medicines he applied to the Municipality doctor for assisting him at the expense of the Municipality. The doctor readily consented to this and went to the place where he found 25 patients lying in a most miserable and dirty condition He gave them some medicines and a white water to be taken bv some of them, and those, six in number, who took it died one after the other in a few hours’ time. The doctor was immediatelv informed, _ on which he, after seeing the dead and covering them all over with mortar, declared that the place is infected and therefore put it under guard of Zaptiehs preventing people to enter it. &lt; After this he commenced inspecting the pilgrims P who were going to Najaf and from each company of them he took out several men and women and put them in that place for expedition to the next world. He then telegraphed to the Wall reporting the appearence of cholera in Karbala, and requesting that a quarantine should be established between Karbala and JNajat. Abul lahad and the patients that are brought to it are now _ under cordon and the control of Government. The Municipality has commenced a compulsory contribution to bespent on such pilgrims by means of a committee composed, of tlie municipality doctor and head clerk, Sheikh Muhammad Waiz, and another named Saiyid Hashim Sindee. To-day they collected some sixty lirahs. ^ ov ember 17 th The collection of contribution continues in municipality by sending letters to people and forcing them to pay according to their name or ability. “ The temporary or pilgrim hospital is intended to be removed to a bigger and distant place near ’Abdul ’Ali’s flour factory. The casualties till the evening were nine to-day, and besides the doctor all agree that they were not of cholera. “ November l^.-The total deaths in the Abul Fahad to-day amounted to tour persons only. Five other Khans together with their hundreds of pilgrims and animals, were put under cordon by the doctor claiming that cases o± cholera have occurred in them. November 19th. Heard from the Mudir of quarantine that the Wali has refused to fix a quarantine between Karbala and Naiaf, saying that a doctor will he sent to Najaf to prevent pilgrims who have symptoms of cholera from entering the town. He has also directed that pilgrims coming from Baghdad or Kadhimain should not touch Karbala, but go directly to Najaf having their Karbala pilgrimage for their return journey. “ Another doctor arrived from Baghdad to assist the municipality doctor m the preservation of public health at Karbala. It is very strange, cholera has not the shadow of existence here, yet the doctor, for purposes of his own, taking the pilgrims’ ordinary illness for his pretext forced in an official belief that the disease is prevailing, and that measures to prevent its increase are to be taken. According to his report to the Government there were only two cases of deaths among the pilgrims to-day. By the instigation of the doctor all the physicians were again summoned in the court, and they were made to give a written statement that if they were once more found out to practise secretly they should be liable to hard imprisonment and fine. The court gives such an order, yet it cannot prevent itself from fearing the doctor and secretly referring to the same physicians. In the evening some hundreds of pilgrims, which came from Mahmudiah and had passed their quarantine days at that place, were stopped from entering the town oy Zaptiyehs who were sent out immediately on receiving the news of their advent. What the poor victims had sufferred by the hand of these wretches is only known to those who agitated for their sake and were weeping like children. It was in the middle of the night that they were brought stealingly into the town by some Khadims and others whose fear lest that they may die of cold, thirst and hunger in the country moved them to undergo the danger. Next day the doctor knew what had happened at night, but owing to a telegram which he had received to be somewhat lenient he overlooked the matter. The hospital was removed from Abul Fahad to the bigger place near ‘Abdul’ Ali’s flour mill. tf Pilgrims’prohibition to enter the town of Karbala before going to Najaf continues, and to-day some more of them were prevented froin coming in. But this prohibition is nothing before public resolution. The Khadims are doing their best to bring them in secretly while the pilgrims have also been taught to oend their way behind the gardens and enter the town by the route or direction which shows that they have cpme from Najaf. In this way all of them are coming in without being noticed. November 21st. With effect from to-day the doctor commenced to inspect the pilgrims, which leave Karbala for Kadhimain, on the26 eve of their departure. Having a bucket of water ready he collects them all, with their riding animals in the municipality square and with a broom which he dips in the bucket he sprinkles the disinfectant on their faces and those of their animafs He does the same thing with the Karbala and Najaf carriages nd their horses, and with the camels, and their loads, which bring grains for Karbala. The slightest fever or indisposition hurries the owner to the hospital from which he never comes out except for burial. To-day several houses in which people died a natural death were put under cordon, and for this reason two bodies were found thrown in the open street by the owners m order to escape the doctors’ operation. * Nove ' r ^ ber * 22 ^.—Last night it was proclaimed to the public that in future they are bound to report any cases of illness which mav happen m their houses to the Mukhtar of their quarter, or directly to the Municipality doctor for his presence and seeing tdem. Should anyone, whether Arab, Persian or Indian, fail to do so he will be liable to either prison or fine. This is another step towards forcing the people to be treated by the Municipality doctor only, when the officials themselves, such as the Qadhi, the head of the Criminal Court and many others whom I know, would prefer to go ill rather than apply to him for treatment The physicians have combined, on oath, to give up practising for some time, and this has thoroughly upset the replace htm ^ neither trust the doctor nor £ et another to * A ^boTofa Wh + m sli ^ t . fever and h ad tied himself to the ■ , » Hazret-i- Abbas shrine, an act commonly done when K .Tx are re fi uested fr °ni God, was dragged out by oc or and his men to the municipality square and thence V pir WaS +i Sent hospital.

This is perhaps the case to some extent; bnt to me it appears that quarantine is a sort of fetish * and panacea with the superior Turkish authorities and that in elaborating rules they lose their sense of proportion and almost forget that quarantine measures are a means and not an end in themselves. They also seem blind to the fact that, if a place A is dangerous to a place B on account of cholera, B cannot be dangerous to A; and their action has been to some extent founded on a fallacy m this connection. The Agents through whom their orders are enforced are no doubt in many cases corrupt. 2 . I shall soon report, in a separate despatch, on the proceedings of a pan-Islamic emissary named Ziyah Bey, who has lately been endeavouring to influence Muhammadan opinion at Baghdad, Karbala and Najaf in favour of a religious and political combination between Turkey and Persia with a view to resisting encroachments by Christian Powers. It seems to me that, for reasons which will be given in my despatch, the mission of this propagandist may be regarded with equanimity. It is probable that the organisers of the mission themselves do not expect any pracrical results from it, but only hope that the British, Russian and Preach Governments will be impressed by an appearance of widespread agitation among Muhammadans. With the inept i- tude which seems characteristic of Turkish proceedings in general, work has been begun in Mesopotamia at a time when the resident Persians, to whom t See VI-8-11 above. chiefly the appeal is addressed, are ex tremely exasperated f against the Turkish Government. 3. Since the beginning of November the weather at Baghdad has turned cold, and on the night of the 17th the thermometer fell to 38 8 Pahrenheit. It is almost impossible to believe that one is still in the same place as two months ago. The first rain for many months fell towards the end of November, nearly an inch being received in two days. One result of the wet weather was the collapse of a barrack, lately built by the Turkish military engineers in the New Camp: nine soldiers were injured by this accident of whom five are in hospital.

No. 1131, dated Baghdad, the 20th December 1907 (received 8th January 1908). (Confidential). From Major J. Ramsay, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, To Sir Louis W. Dank, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to inform you that I recently sent the Vice-Consul from Kerbala to Nedjef with instructions to see what‘he could learn about the current of public opinion in that very important centre regarding political affairs in Persia, and also regarding the Oudh Bequest. He was told to see the really leading Mujtahids and to try and find out whether they would be willing to see me should I ever go to Nedjef. Muhammad Hassan, who is a very well-educated and intelligent Shiah, has submitted an interesting report the gist of which I give below. 2. His arrival in Nedjef was the subject of much comment, consequently he was carefully watched by the several parties concerned. He found the Anglo-Eussian Arrangement much discussed, and opinion seemed^ to be divided, some thought that the Arrangement foreboded the end of Persia, and others thought that it was a matter concerning only England and Russia.^ He says that there was a persistent rumour in Nedjef that the leading Mujtahids were going to telegraph to Tehran a protest against the *' Arrangement,” but that before anything was decided news came of the raid on Meshed by Turcomans, and on receipt of this news the telegrams, of which free translations are given in enclosure A, were sent. The Vice-Consul thinks that the telegrams contain a reference to the Agreement, but they have not been very clearly worded. B. I had heard at Bahgdad that some persons said to be “ Pidayis ” had come from Persia and had gone to the sacred shrines, and I asked the Vice- Consul to make enquiries about them, as I could obtain no definite informa tion here. The Vice-Consul says : “ From the statement of the only authority I found on the subject it seems that these people, who were five in number, came in secret and spent nearly twelve days in Nedjef. They were dressed' like well-to-do Persian merchants, kept their names secret, and while in Nedjef they generally walked separately as if they were strangers. They are said to have been very clever and intelligent people. Their object was to see the Mujtahids, get their views, visit the schools, and obtain general informa tion about what is going on at Nedjef. One of them called on Sayed Kadhim Yezdi, in the shape of a follower, and succeeded in obtaining a letter in favour of the Mejlis. The letter was conditional and copies of it were immediately sent to Persia. It is very curious that no one, and (not ?) even the Mujtahids, know anything about them. My informant knew them because he was recommended from Persia. The Russian Consulate was also making enquiries about them, but failed to get anything.” I understand that the word “ Fidayi ” means martyr, but it is more usually used in the sense of a revolutionary. The letter said to have been obtained may be of value in the game of party politics, for Sayed Kadhim Yezdi is one of these really leading men who has hitherto refrained from giving active support to the Parliamentary party. My Baghdad informant told me that the Russian Consul-General had sent a messenger to Sayed Kadhim Yezdi to ask him about these “Fidayis” and had received a reply that in the first place the Sayed did not know them, and in the second place that, if they had confided any secrets to his keeping' he did not know why the Russian Consul-General should expect him to be guilty of a breach of confidence in divulging those secrets. 4. The following is the purport of the Vice-Consul’s conversation with Sayed Muhammad Bahr-ul-ulum .—This man used to get the whole of the Nedjef share of the Oiidh Bequest. He did not mention the Bequest, but he said that it was most important that the internal disturbances in Persia should be suppressed, as they would certainly lead to interference by England and Acting British Consul-General, Baghdad, the leading Mujtahidsi^ P 1 _ 2 and Russia under the pretext of protecting their interests. He said that if this happened, Turkey would also become active, and the whole Muhammadan world be disturbed. Sayed KadUm Yezdi.-M the Vice-Consul’s first visit he said that the Oudh Bequest was certainly meant to reach the poor, and that this misfit be arranged through a banker acting under the orders of the Muitahids He said that he would require time for consideration before he could sav whether* he ^ aD ^ discl , iss . tlle matfcer - 0n the second visit Sayed Kadhim said that, if the Vice-Consul wished to ensure a place in Paradise, he must do what he could to get the Oudh Bequest money for the poor. Sayed Kadhim condemned the conduct of the present recipients, and said that ijthe opinion o the leading and first class Mujtahids a change in the present arrangements w s required. He said that the leading Mujtahids could never be got to give a pint and unanimous ppinion. When the Vice-Consul asked him whether was^knt eXPreSS theSG VieWS t0 mG P ersoriall y 1 Came to Nedjef, the Sayed Mnlla KadUm Khorasani.—'Re was found discussing Persian nolitie^ and news and denouncing foreign loans. He said that he would like to see a change m the present arrangements for distributing the Oudh Bequest but would take no active part in bringing it about: for fear of incurril the enmity of the present recipients. n ° tne He said that be was continuing to support the Parliamentary party He totTs^n to theT'oe' Went t0 866 ^ h6 W ° Uld repeat ^ what Sheikh Abdulla Mazandarani.-.’lhh man agreed with Mulla Kadhim Khorasam that a change was needed. He said that perhaps ElOO mfeht be paid by each of the ten recipients at Nedjef into a fund to nri™' • by the leading Mnjtahids or'by the Co Jlate He saM that iUhTcrtn.- Oeneral visited him, he would give his opinion after careful* conRidpTnf perhaps after discussing the matter with th^other Mujtahids. C0DBlderatlOD * Basi Mirza Hussein Mirza Khalil.-he said that the money should certainly go to the poor: but when he was asked if he would give thnf to the Consul-General in person, he gave no reply. Mirza Hussein is a P yery MujfaMds 8 Bame reputation oxceed th at of any of the other - a- 'Fj 16 yjee-Gonsu 1 also saw other Mujtahids, but their opinions are not of mdmdua 1 importance, and several of them being actual recipients Ll tp* Oudh Bequest naturally think the present arrangement a good^ne. m ^ 5. The Vice-Consul had received instructions that he was not to making enquiries on my behalf, but to assume the roll of a nions^h i! asking the advice of his religious leaders as to the line he should .a 8 ? advising the Resident.

Enclosure of a letter to Eis Majesty's Secretary of State for India % Eo. 142) dated the 27th July 1905.? No. 432, dated Baghdad, the 15th June 1905 (Confidential). From— Major L. S. Newmarch, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to reply to your letter No. 1336 E.-B., dated 6th April 1905, regarding the accompanying memorial to His Majesty the King, Emperor of India, about the distribution of the Oudh bequest. 2. I have caused the names and seals in the accompanying petition to he compared with the accounts of the distribution as it was formerly made, and I attach herewith a note by my Dragoman, Sujjad Hyder, who is thoroughly conversant with the subject, giving the result of his comparison. 3. It will he seen from his note that only four seals in the account books correspond with the seals in the petition, and that all the rest are dissimilar. This is a very significant fact, for, as he very appropriately remarks, a seal in this country is very important and much more important than a signature. In the petition the names are all subscribed by one hand, and are not in any sense signatures. The seals alone therefore are the only means of identification, and of these only four in the petition correspond with those in the acquittance rolls or receipt books of the former distribution. This seems to me to throw some doubt on the genuineness of the present petition. I. I also sent the petition to the British Vice-Consul at Kerhala for any light he might he able throw on it, and I attach herewith a copy of his letter on the subject. It seems to me to throw grave doubts on the genuine ness of the petition. 5. Erom independent enquiries I have made myself, I am of opinion— though I cannot prove it—that the petition is the work of one man named Itimad-us-Sadat. He was, and still is, the Private Secretary waft, factotum of Saiyid Muhammad Bakir Tabatabai, who is the Mujtahid at Kerbala, who formerly received and distributed the whole of the Kerbala moiety of the Oudh bequest. Saiyid Muhammad Bakir was far too grand a person to distribute the money himself, and used to content himself with giving instructions to Itimad-us-Sadat, who distributed it in the way I have described in my * Pro. No. 70 in External a, September 1903 , letter 5 *' No. 390, dated 20th September Nos. 67-86. 1902. Eor the purposes of this distribution, Itimad-us-Sadat had numerous seals, many of which were probably genuine and were given to him by their owners in order to facilitate the distribution, i.e., in order to save themselves the trouble of personal attendance, or to keep on good terms with Itimad-us-Sadat. These seals Itimad-us-Sadat has probably applied to the present petition in order to give it an air of reality and thereby induce others to sign it. There is, however, never any difficulty in getting signatures at Kerbala or Nejef to any papermf this nature, and persons claiming to be Mujtahids, British subjects, destitute paragons, and the like, often send me large sheets of paper sovered with signatures which are perfectly valueless in support of the pre tended object. The distribution of the Kerbala moiety of the Oudh bequest was a perfect mine of wealth to Itimad-us-Sadat, and he is the man who has suffered more than any one else by the change in the system of distribution. He came to see me a few days ago ; and when I began to sympathise with him about this change in his condition, he explained to me that he had sub mitted a petition to His Majesty the King-Emperor on the subject, and hoped that the good old days would return again. Subsequently however, in conversation with my Dragoman on the subject, be seemed much alarmed at having sent a petition, and at having confessed to me that he had done so. He explained to the Dragoman that he had also sent to His Majesty a separate petition on his own account, and asked him to intercede with me in case I were displeased with his conduct.2 6. Whatever may he the system of distribution, there will always he complaints, because there is not enough money for everybody, and there will always be many persons who will claim to receive something, or who will main tain that they do not receive enough. It is, I think, true that, under the present system, nearly all the recipient Mujtahids keep most of the money (Rs. 500 per mensem = £33) for them selves and their families; and if charity begins at home, they have reason. One or two Mujtahids—Saiyid Muhammad Bakir Behbehani for one—do make a small distribution, but probably none of it goes to Itimad-us-Sadat, and very little to the persons whose names are on the present petition. 7. I do not advocate any change in the present system, which is working well, and regarding which I myself receive very few complaints now-a-days. Time will soon remove the recipients of Itimad-us-Sadat’s former bounty : I think the great majority of them have already disappeared : and their complaints will go with them. With the exception of these, the Mujtahids and the students are gradually getting accustomed to the new system. The present Mujtahids of the Oudh bequest are gradually getting more important, the older and more fanatical Mujtahids are dying off, and the time cannot be far distant when our payees will themselves be the leaders, and under my proposed Jirga system (already successful in the case of Saiyid Hussain Kumi—the last appointment) the creators of Mujtahids in future. 8. I do not claim perfection for the present system, hut it is infinitely superior to the old corruption. It is true that three of the biggest Mujtahids (one at Kerbala and two at Nejef) have not joined the present system, and have refused, for various reasons, to receive a share of the Oudh bequest: but they were no parties to the old system either. With the exception of these three men, I think the present recipients of the Oudh bequest are very creditable representatives of the Mujtahid class, and it is very unfair to describe them as “ten ungodly and unrighteous men ”. Although it is hard to measure godliness and righteousness, I think they compare very favourably with the rest of their class, and I have great hopes for the future of the present system. 9. The memorial received with your letter under reply is herewith returned^ Note by Sujjad Hyder, 2nd Dragoman, British Residency and Consulate-General, Baghdad, dated 30th May 1905. I examined the receipt hooks for the quarter ending 31st March 1900, for the quarter ending 31st December 1901, and for the quarter ending 31st December 1902, and for January 1903. A number of names contained in the petition to the King-Emperor are also to be found in the books; hut as in the petition only the names are put down without the parentage, whereas in the books the parentage is also given, it is impossible to say whether the petitioners and the persons whose receipts are given in the books are the same persons or not. The seals should help in the elucidation of this point, but they prove, if anything, just the contrary: for except g four seals marginally noted which are the (3) Khadija. same in the books and the petition, all (4) I&gt;0, are dissimilar. And a seal is very import ant in this part of the country: in fact, much more important than a signature. There are also names in the petition which are not found at all in the books. Stjjjad Hydeb.3 Dated tha 2nd Jnue 1905. From— Mirza Muhammad Hassan Mohsin, British Vice-Consul at Kerbala, To— Major L. S. Newmarch, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad. I very carefully examined the Mazbata, which the people of Kerbala have addressed to His Majesty the King-Emperor, on the subject of the Oudh Bequest. The names written in the petition are those of students, Kadhims, and the members of the two well-known families of Wahhab and Shahristani, who do not hesitate to beg religious moneys when they get a chance of doing it. During the late distribution nearly all of them had shares which were discontinued since the establishment of the present system. But whether the present petition is genuine, and the seals therein contained actually belong to the persons, is a matter which I doubt myself. There is, as far as I know, one Saiyid Abdul Kassim Behhehani, one Saiyid Hussain Kumi, and one Saiyid Abdul Hussain Kaliddar in the whole of Kerbala, and their seals are also known to me. In the present petition these names appear, but with different seals, showing that they were either purposely changed by the persons themselves, or that the whole petition is fabricated by some scoun drels, as is often done in Kerhala and Nejef. They have hundreds of idle seals which they use whenever they require. The signatures are not written by the parties themselves, and therefore it is impossible to say whether the petition is true or a forged one. The discontinuation of their former allowance by the present Mujtahids has made them so far discontented. Both the Mazbata and Sujjad Hyder’s note are herewith returned.0 i 1905. SIMLA.

Foreign Office Frees—No. 693—22-7-05—36.This document, written in Persian is addressed to 'His Majesty the King of England and Emperor of all India* and is signed hy a large number of Mohammedan *Seyyids' (Lords or descendants of Mohammed) Sheikhs and obners. They state that they are a body consisting of *Seyyids*, 'Alewis' (descendants of Ali), students and also poor and deserving people, who number over 30,000 persons, that since the commencement of the Oudh Charities, which is over sixty years, they have from father to son, been participators in those charities; but for three years until now, Mr. Newmarch, the Con sul General at Bagdad has upset a work which has been carried on by the British Government and its agents re sident in Calcutta, for 60 years, and has divided and distributed the Oudh charities among ten ungodly and unrighteous men not one of whom gives a penny to any one. The petitioners add that it is not,consistent with the justice and benevolence of the British Govern ment that it should upset a good work which has been going on for more than 60 years and deprive a body con sisting of 'Seyyids* (Lords) 'Alewis' (descendants ofAll) and Students and poor and deserving people, of their bread and throw their into misery in order to en rich ten unrighteous men. Hence they request His Ma jesty the King to give orders that the Oudh charities may be carried on as they were formerly for 60 years i and that'they will ever pray for the preservation of the i 11u stri ou s British 0 eve rnme n t'.

I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the accompanying list of Mujtahids at Kerbala and Nejef who are in receipt of allowances from the Oudh Bequest 2. Although I receive many applications for a share in this Bequest, I seldom now receive any complaint, and I anticipate no difficulty in the future distribution of this fund. 3. Syud Mahomed Bakir Behbehani is a Mujtahid who was recommended to me by His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and as time goes on I hope to be able to comply with other recommendations made by His Britannic Majesty’s Minister. 4s. The reason why Nejef receives more than Kerbala at present is that, owing to the transition from the old method of payment to the new, a slight surplus has accumulated to the credit of Nejef but this will probably be worked off in July.

The correspondence is principally between the Government of India (Foreign and Political Departments), the India Office, and the Foreign Office. There are many enclosures that include correspondence from the following:the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia (who also acts as the British Consul-General in Baghdad);Mirza Muhammad Hassan Mohsin, British Vice-Consul at Kerbala;several mujtahids (a person accepted as an authority on Islamic law) from Kerbala and Nejaf;J W Hose, Chief Secretary to the Government of the United Provinces.The Oudh Bequest was an annual payment made by the Government of India to the mujtahids of the holy shrine cities of Karbala and Najaf. This payment was the interest on a loan given to the East India Company in 1825 by the King of Awadh, who instructed that it be used to improve religious learning and help the poor of Shia communities in Iraq.The papers within the volume cover the discussion over how the bequest was to be distributed. This system of distribution underwent several changes over the years, owing to complaints of unfairness by potential recipients and corruption as perceived by the British. Included within the volume are several petitions from mujtahids and representatives of the Indian residents of Kerbala and Nejef for a fairer distribution of the funds.The volume includes extracts from the summaries of events in Turkish Arabia that were produced on a monthly basis by the Political Resident in Baghdad.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident and Consul-General, Turkish Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Kerbala</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kerbala</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nejef</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Awadh</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Charitable uses</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x0003a2#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
