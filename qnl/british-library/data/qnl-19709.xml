Then he was taken to Urom-ul-Caiwain where he was purchased by a man named Maftul who engaged him in diving. Maftul died and the slave became a property of his son Khalifah. The latter- manumitted him for the sake of God in his lifetime in the nresenc© of some poopl© 6f Umm-ul-Caiwain. After sometime Khalifah died but now some of Khalifali's heirs have complained to Shaikh Hamad bin Ibrahim, Chief of Umm-ul-Qaiwain, against him. Enquiries were made and it was ascertained that he was a free man. A document was written for him, as ner copy enclosed fo 1 ^ your* information, which was witnessed by the said Shaikh. T made further enquiries from the Slir* i'kh of Umm-ul—Qaiwain and others in r©gard to the manumission of the slave by his master. I found out that some of his master's heirs have certainly the intention of re-enslav ing the man. T therefore prevented the Individual who wanted to re-enslave Almas. T request you therefore kindly to grant Almas a ''anumission Certificate in support of his freedom as he is originally born in Africa, Statement made by Almas of Suwahil, ag©d 38 years. Recorded on 97th Shaban 13*5 (=23-3-95). When I was 8 years old a man of Suwahil kidnapped and sold me to a man of Khazrah of Batinah named Said. I remained with him for 3 years then he sold m© to a man of Umm—ul—Q.aiwain named !faftul. The man engaged me in diving and after- sort© years my master Faftul d^'ed and T was transferred to his son Khalifah. Two years after the death of his father Khalifah invited a paruy 0 ,1 men oi Umm—ul—Oaiwain and asked them to give evidenceto the fact that he has manumitted roe for the saVe of God.^rvj n0 or, « should roolest roe. Khalifah died and gfter his death his brother corrmlaired to Haroad bin Ibrahim, Chief of Uroro-ul-Oal^aln that I was his slave. The Shaikh directed us to the Shara for &lt; k decision. T.fy roanuroisslon was proved In Shara Law Court and Shaikh Haroad heard the witnesses himself and signed the decision of the Shara Court. Now roy roaster's brother la always threatening me that he would re-enslave roe. I aim taking refuge with the High British Government and hep- them to be kind enough to favour roe with a Government Manumission Certificate so that T may be safe from, the threats and molestation of Arabs. ^ralse be to God of the world and peace may be on the best of messangers our lord Muhammad, Wis decendsnts and followers ''itnesses gave evidence that Khalifah bin Maftul manumitted his slave when he was alive. The man told the neonle to give evidence that bio slave has been manumitted for the sake of God and If anyone changed his decision after having been witness thereunto the sin shall rest or those who would alter his decision. This was written by roe Bedr bin Yusuf (priest of Umm-ul-Qaiwa1n^ and his manumission was proved to me by the evidence of witnesses. Dated Rabi I, 1343 ( g 235tober 1924).

That she died this year in the Summer season while he was in the diving hanks. That a certain Sultan Hanhall of Qatar, a relative of his mistress, however a-rrested him (Belal) on his return from diving on the pretext that he was a bonded slave and that he has heen transferred to him by inher1tance. Belal allages that he gave the document to Sultan but he did not agree and put him in Irons. Belal got an opportunity and absconded to Shargah. I made enquiries from some people of Dehai and they confirm ed that Belal has been freed by his mistress Muzah and Sultan has no right to him. T searched for Sultan through the Shaikh of De'Hal but could not trace him as he hag gone to Qatar. In my opinion the slave Belal deserves a Government Manumission Certificate so that he may not be molested by the Arabs. Sttitement made by Belal bin Khamls aped about 30 years* Recorded on x9th Rabi-al-Thani 1344 (= 6-11-25 ). My mother was a slave of Faslr Suwaidl a resident of Aiman who died long ago. I and ray mother were Inherited by his daughter Muzah. My mother died 10 years ago but T remained with the said woman. When she wanted to go on pilgrimage she called a priest and asked him to writs a manumission certificate for me. He w^te the certificate or which the Qadhl of Debal and other people wrote their evidence. Muzah proceeded on her pilgrimage and I stayeu in the house. She returned to Debai safely from her lourney and asks j sho waa treating me well I used to give her sore of ray earnings. When I was in the diving 'bank Muzah died. On my return from diving Sultan Fanbali Suwaidl of Qatar; a relative of Muzah^arrested me on the 'pretext that T was a slave uf Muzah and that he was her heir. I told him that T had heen manumitted and showed him the certificate hut he took the paper from me and nut me in irons in order to take mo to Qatar, T got an opportunity broke the chain and came to the Hesidency Agency at Shargah.

I ta Ve the liberty to address this letter to you In re .card to divers who ran away from my towns and take- refuge in 'uscat, Bandar Abbas, Lingah and Bahrain and some time in Bushlre, , slairning to oe slaves whereas they are free men and owe sums of money advanced to them by their Fakhudaa for diving. T have often addressed K.B, Isa bin Abdul Latif the Realdenc Agent, Shargah, on this subtest but no result has been achieved, I am therefore compelled to write to vou to inform you of the i A j loss sustained by us from the doings of divers. Similar affair YTrrfr^ ' ~1 ' !■ took place in the past;in the t^me of the late K.B. Abdul Latif ' i ' i ✓ nossibly in I'*?#A.H. (-1^08) when the Hon'ble Colonel Cox was Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the arragement was arrived at that any diver who will take refuge in any of the places mentioned above should be sent by the Hon'ble the Political Resident wlthctManumisaion Certificate to the Residency Agent, Shargah, and the claim existing against the diver should be settled in the Residency Agency in the presence of the Salifaeh Judge. As it is not hidden to |four Honour since the past five or six years divers have gone to extremes in taking advance from ^•3 their ITakhudas and as a result every diver is now owing sums / varying from Rs,4000/- to Rs.3000/- and the lowest of thwd in rank owes Rs.POOO/-. For this reason T am faced with the difficulty namely that the capitals of my merchants have thus been advanced to divers and the merchants owe money to H.B. V 's subjects, I therefore take the liberty to state that if justice is not dispensed by H.B.M'a Government as In the past in respect of divers taking refuge in the towns memtioned above the present ' state of af^a^rc will be exacerbated all the more and the divers mean this. i further beg to state that as you are aware the welfare of the T^ucial Coast depends first on God's bounty and then»•&gt; ». on ths ©arnings front diving,!

Political Agency, Bahrain, Dated the^ January ■ 10r, ' 5 To f The Secretary ,to the Hon'ble the Pol in the Persian Gulf, Buehire . MEMORANDUM . Reference;- Your letter Ho. SI, dated the 8th January 1926. These persons cannot Tbe traced here. I would however point out that from your letter it would appear that the men are slaves^ not free me^ and as such they could not be indebted to their pearling masters, who do not pay slaves. Since I have been in Bahrain many such cases have occurred. In the event of a slave escaping with a view to obtaining manumission, the owners frequently allege debts in the hope that this will enable them to recover the slaves. It has been the custom, if it was obvious that they were slaves, to decline to accept claims for money. This being known there have been cases in which the owners have declared t that run away slaves were not slaves at all, but free meny indebted to them and in some cases it has been found that they were in fact slaves, but the owner knowing that as slaves- they could not be indebted, endeavoured to prove a money claim and to support it had to allege they were free. I would suggest therefore, that if it be known that they were slaves, they have merely escaped from slavery - if however they are free men and indebted to their nakhudas it is open to the nakhudas, in accordance with the diving rules existing all over the Gulf, to file a suit against any nakhuda who employs them and who on the claim being proved, becomes liable to J /• to the previous Nakhuda for the surn due. This practice is invariably followed and claims against Bahrain Nakhudas are often proved and vice wersa. Bahrain Kakhudas frequently go to Qatar and Najd and recover their claims from Nakhudas who have engaged their divers without a 'Burwah'. It is therefore open to the owners to appear either in person^ or by authorised agent here to prove their claims against their new employers. As they have failed in this case to follow the recognised practice I am inclined to think the men are not free divers but run away slaves and consequently the owners are aware that they cannot prove a claim. In any case we have not been able to trace them in Bah^jkin. A Major, C.I.E. Pelitical Agent, Bahrain. /No.227/10/2 of 1926 RECtlVtu \ y7'^' 109^ ' !

Sliargah says that he personally knows Musuhj he originally carae to Shargah from Mekran xO or years ago and began diving with Ahmad bin Mohd, bin Durwesh. He was diving as a servant and not as a slave. He was diving for a year but was not efficient in diving, therefore he began to do other work for Ahiaad bin Mohd. bin Burwesh; he soon gained a reputation tnat he is a very clever man, a pay was fixed for him and he was working as an Agent for his dsxxi master, i.e. selling rice, collecting creaite and doing other business for him. He had sold 700 bags of rice. Ma His mastei asjieo. him lor the account anu. thus thyre was a disagreement between them. People said to Ahmad that he should not press Musuh anu he v, ill give the account in due course. Ahmad then sent Musuh to Abu Dh4bi to recover from one of his debtors, Husuh went there, recovered Rs. 2,000/- of which he sent Rs.i,700/- to Ahmad and kept Rs.300/- for himself and came to Bandar Abbas anu applied for manumission. Sangoo x* a Baluch of Mekran came to Umm-ul- Caiv.'ain irom Me^ran and worked as a diver. The year of nis axxival anu how many years he worked as a diver is not known. Prom Umm-ul-Qaiwain he went to Aj^an and x woriv.ea as a diver for about 3 years. Then he came to Ahmad bin Mohd. Durwesh as his servant and worked as his diver. Ihere was a dispute about pay between him and- AMmad and he refused to dive. Ahmad demanded his money and he ran away and came to Bandar Abbas. The amount he owed to Ahmad is not known but as the Shaikh said both Sangoor axid Husuh owed Ahmad Rs. 4,200/- ITote . ihe account of rice was not clear with Musuh; the Shaikh has written to the Residency Agent as Ahmad said to him. After getting manumission certificates from Consul / Bandar Abbas^they came to Shargah.1*03°^ Of 1926. British Residency &amp; Consulate General# Bushire, the 30th December 1926. (o To His Majesty's Consul, Bander Abbas. Please refer to your Ko.227/10/2, dated the 4th February 1926, about manumission of slaves. 2. In regard, generally, to Persian Baluchiartim fugitives from the ^rab Coast, the Hon'ble the Political Resident thinks that a different procedure should be followed than that reported by you. 3. firstly, such men, kidnapped Persia, taken over seas and then escaped back to their native land, should not be in any danger of ^eing re-enslaved. They hardly want manumission papers at all, but, if they do, the Karguzar's certificate is quite good enough. Just as in thousands of instances domestic born slaves in Persia are satisfied with their late owners manumission paper . It is a British Consul*s business to intervene on bAhalf of Persian bsj»&amp;*« in Persia, only when they fear molesta tion or re-enslavement from their Persian owners. 4. In the absence of extradition agreements between Persia and the Trueial Chiefships a Consul can* OL not corapel|f4gitive slave-or even an indebted absconding servant - who has reached Persia to return to his employer in Arabia. Demands for such action are occasionally made by the Trueial Chiefs, and the Consul is relieved of worry if he does not intervene at all between the fugitive and the Karguzar. A Persian subject who has fled back to Persia should not be harboured in a Consulate but should'*! - o be referred forthwith to the Karguzar. 5. It seeias that oaiigoo (dangur) and Moosa» having received British ^anumisBion CertificateSat B a nder Abbas» went back to Shargah to work on their own account; and according to the Residency Agenda report they were never slaves at all. Musa at 4pa»t is a clever man. He was employed in a position of trust and he absconded after getting into debt. 6. The proper officer for these men to appeal to was obviously the Residency Agent at Shargah. As they have returned now to the Trucial Coast Colonel Prideaux is not inclined to give them any further assistance unless and until they take refuge in the Agency, when the question of their real former status will have to be investigated de novo . If they were slaves, they are not indebted but they cannot be allowed to live in Trucial Oman. If they v /ere not slaves, the Sal if eh Court will decide the amount of their indebtedness. 7. Your reference to Residency telegram No.124, dated the 12th March 1925, does not seem relevant. That telegram referred only to cases at I»ingah, where the Consular Agent has no Military Escort to look after refugees. In regard to these, the correspondence with the Residency Agent, Shargah, can be more conveniently dealt with at Bushire than at Bander Abbas. 8. In future, no doubt, you wAll refer to this Residency for instructions about all fugitives from Arabia who are allowed to take sanctuary with you claiming that they have escaped from slavery.

I 'beg to forward herewith a statement made 'by Yasminah of Swahil who has taken refuge with children Sallum, Khalluf and Ismail at the Residency Agency. I made enquir ies from some people of Ras ul Khaimah and found out that her statement in saying that her Mistress Aishah hint Ihrahim Muhammad had manumitted her and her children is correct and that the claim of those people against her master, Ali 'bin Ahmad, is incorrect. I am of opinion that if you have no objection Manumi ssion Certificates may he granted to the slave and her children as they are entitled to them and they are originall; from Zanzibar. Tasminah's hushand, Barut, is a Swahili and not a slave. Barut and his sons are working in diving and all of them wish to live at Ras ul Khaimah in order to earn their livelihood there. Statement made hy Yasminah Swahili (her father's name unknown) aged ahout 51 years. Recorded on the 2nd Rajah I was horn at Zanzibar and during childhood I was kidnapped hy a man whose name is not known to, me and brought to the town of Naburi at Zanzibar and sold to Ali bin Ahmad of Ras ul Khaimah. My master brought me to Sur and from there to Batinah and Ras ul Khaimah. When I was at full age Ali made me his concubine for one year and then left for Zanzibar and kept me with his mother Aisha bint Irahira Muhammad. Ali bin 'hmad after two years wrote to his mother to get me married to his slave Hamadi Swahili. I HcruT married him and gave birth to a son named Sallum^aged about 18 years. Hamadi divorced me and I then married another slave named Barut Swahili who is up to no?/ my husband. I Acn.2 fcrur got two sons from him one named Khalluf A age(i ahout 13 master All 'bin Ahmad did not return from Zanzibar. Two years ago news was received that he had died there. As his mother was an old v /oman and was treating us in a good manner, my hushand, sons and myself did not leave her and looked after her and in return the woman granted us a manumission certificate so that no one may molest us. I produced the paper 'before Shaikh Sultan 'bin Salim, Ohief of Has ul Khaimah, who signed and sealed it. Some people of Has ul Khaimah also witnessed the same. In the month of 3il Hejjeh 1345 (June 1927) Aisha daughter of I'brahim died. Two men of Has ul Khaimah called ■Vb dull ah 'bin Barwan and AMullah 'bin Nasir and a woman named Alia put up a claim against us on the pretext that a sum of money was due to them from our master Ali 'bin *hmad on account of cost'of some goods and wanted to take my son Khalluf and sell him and divide his sale proceeds among themselves. I complained to Shaikh Sultan ahout the intention of these people and the Shaikh presented and threatened them and told them that if they had any claim against our master, Ali 'bin Ahmad, they should have done so during the life time of our mistress, Aisha, as our master had left Has ul Khaimah for Zanzibar 30 years ago. krvu* n He made them to understand that I and my sons aa?® free and no one hai any right to molest us. As I do not rely on the Arahs and am afraid that after some time they may arrest one of my sons and sell him I, therefore, lay my grievances 'bfeore H.B.M's Govern ment and beg them to he kind enough to grant us Manumission Oertificates so that v /e may be safe and may not he molested 'by the Arahs and will 'be able to earn our livelihood at Has ul Khaimah as we had been brought up at that place from childhood. years and the other named Ismail aged about 7 years.

I have the honour to submit herewith attached a state ment made 'by a slave named ■L'atuf d/o Walaid Swahil, who has taken refuge^ with her daughter, in the Hesidency Agency. I have made- the necessary enquiries as to the correct- | ness of the statement of the said slave and have found thati she has 'been set free hy her mistree Muuaah hint Abdullah hin Thani. Some persons from the Rasul Khaimah called at the Agency and 'bore witness to the correctness of her manumission. And as regards the claim of Jasim hin Muhamad hin Ahaid, same is a fabrication against the said slave and her daughter , The slave and her children petition to H.B.M's Government to grant them manumission certificate 3 uo make them immune from claims. They deserve manumission. I also request that) if you deem it advisable, a letter may be written to the Shaikh of Ras ul Khaimah asking him to prevent the slave being molested by any one during the time she chooses to stay there. Decision rests with you. Statement made by Latuf d /o Walaid Swahili aged about 50 years, recorded on the 21st Sha'ban,1347(2-2-1929). My mother was named Za'fur daughter of Mubarak, she was imported from Zanzibar by a man named Ubaid bin Thani of .Sas ul Khaimah some years back and sold her to his wife called Mouaah bint Ubaid of Has ul Khaimah. Mouaah in the last days of her age set my mother, Za*fur, free. After her manumission Walaid took her (in marriage) and I was toaxi born. Mouzah died and her brother Muhammad bin Ubaid took us over and we were held by him, in respect. Afterwards 1 got married to a slave called Ismail bin Mubarak and gave birth to my daughter called Saudah, lV ho now is alive andand aged 30 years. Saudah was married to slave Salim 'bin BaM* and gave birth to a son named Ubaid aged ahout 9 years and two daughters namely Mitha aged 7 years and Khadijah ahout 6 i years old, all from the said Salim. Muhammad hin ITbaid died and his children divided his estates, and my daughter with her children, were not included in the deceased's estates because we are free. Now in the month of Bajah 1347(December 1928) Jasim bin Muhammad bin Ubaid has transgressed upon us saying we are the slaves of his father. The said Muhammad coraplaine« to Shaikh Sultan bin Salim in order to help him to bring us back to serfdom. We therefore take refuge with H.B.M*s Government petitioning them to manumit us because, we are originally from Zanzibar and request the Govern ment to grant us manumission certificates zsA to live in Has ul Khaimah with our husbands and earn our livelihood I there.

Zaid bin Sa^ar's action Is a violation of the Shaikh's treaty with the British Govrt., in regard to the Slave Trade and he Is therefore liable to punishment for it. The Shaikh cannot punish the man so it Is of no use to write to him on th^ subject.

After he was visited and the matter discussed with him. Shaikh Haskar punished lamad until he admitted that the hoy was with him and he sent uim jo Baraimi.

TTor this reason in my humhle opinion j providing you approve a letter may he written to the luler of Shargah asking him to either punish the^two men or to send them to the Shaikh of Dehaijdecision rests with you.

I arranged with him to pay my son a monthly pay of 'Giiree rupeesj food and clothes in consideration of my son serving him in the day tlme / in taking water on a donkey to his house and to ramain with me at night time in my house. Tor twelve days affairs want on on this 'basis hut after that period my son did not come home as usual. I therefore went to the house of the said Tamad and enquired from him ahout my son and he told me that he had no knowledge of him. Thereupon I went to the Governments man at Dehai and informed him ahout the case and he took/ toe with himself to Shaikh Hashar 'bin Maktuai, hecuase the Buler was not at Dehai at that time. I informed the Shaikh all ahout the-affiar. Shaikh Hashar,summoned Hamad' 'bin Katfoor at once and inquired from him ahout the hoy. Hamad denied knowing anything ahout him and added that he would take an oath on God that he has no knowledge of my son nor he knew where he exist.®he Sahikh did not accept the suggested oath. 'Te told the Shaikh that we would do inquiries and let him know the result.

I did my best in conjunction with your cousin Tusuf bin Nasir and,at last, got the boy back from the interior of the Oman and he was handed over to our brother Tusuf bin Nasir. I wrote a letter to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar asking \ him to send al Bahoomi to me to enable me to punish him for doing such evil works thereby violating the honour of our Jurisdiction and ©ur native land.

'^e Hesidenoy Agent ,3liargah. f®. Oaptain H,G., Al'ban. Under Secretary to Politioal Resident in the Persian Gulf. Bushire. A.a., I have the honour to state that on the 30th January 1931,morning time,the new warship H.M.S*'Hasting'arrived at Shargah and I,at onoe,called on hoard and met the-Captain of the ship who asked me for the news of the Oman Ooast. I informed him alsout ATadur Rahman 'bin Muhammad who came 'back from Aden and is now staying with the Ruler of Shargah and is 'busy creating troubles and disturbances for the Residency Agency and how slaves take refuge with him and he refuses to restore them to their masters. Three hours passed from this and the Ruler of Shargah did not call on 'board the ship to interview the CTaptain. I therefore sent K.S.,Husain 'bin Hasan,in my launch,to shore k-o and/came up with the Shiakh to call on the Captain . Then in presence of the aaptain of the warshipthe question of the ^ ^ . was discussed sailing boat eloped from pearling 'banks and taken to Shargah. x 3 he Shaikh did not heed to our words and then their insinuations to Sroor for doing evils to us in Ras-ul-Khaimah was 'brought in. The Captain having come to know of the facts told the Kuler of S^argah that he would report these to the Hon*'ble the Political Resident and that he would carry out orders given to him 'by His Honour on this subject.Then the Shaikh landed f from the warship and solutes were fired for him .His features howevere shew that he was enraged.For this reason warship Cyclamen arrived at Shargah and hoth men-of-war remained in front of Shargah on the night of the 30th January.on the 31s1 January I called on board H.M,S^Hasting' and the 'Oyclamen* in morning timejand landed at 7 *oclock Arabic time and the 1 / warships left ^hargah.^&gt;0 1 After nightfall^when I was asleep in my house; suddenly a hue and cry was heard in the vicinity of the house and the women folk informed me that Ahdur Rahman 'bin Muhammad accompanied 'by ahout hundred men,inhabitants of Hirah, had collected in front of the gate of our house,in our 'bazaars and on the sea/in front of our house and that there existed the Shaikh of ^hargah and his fighting men jUX) and they demanded the slaves who had taken refuge with/in and that they were trying to enter the house. Some persons from the inhabitants of Shargah told Abduic Rahman 'bin Muhammad and the Shaikh that it was not a good deed they were doing and that it would 'bring them- repentence in the end^because the Agency is a British f.nvw Government's house ..After some insistence upon them they went to the Shaikh's house. This deeds of theirs much astonished me.In fact was it not for the intervention of their own men some frightfu affairs would have happen between us. QcL I 'beg to forward herewith letters,in original,receiv from Ajman and Debai congratulating me on my safety. I am extremely worried on this account as it is not improbable that there would happen to me while/in the streetssomethii! similar to what,already,happened to my cousin who was kill ed at Shargah and a letter of undertaking was taken frera from the Tiaikh of Shargah and his subjects for my safety and a copy of which I beg to submit herewith for your .information,another copy of which I sent to the a haikh by way of a reminder as he might have fprgotten it. I enclose also a copy of the Shaikh's letter to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in /-'he Persian Gulf regarding Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad when lie requested said Abdur Rahman that f-he/should be returned from Aden. In my poor opinion this deed of Abdur Rahman bin Muhammadls is an insult to the Residency Agency and is a ccrtempt towards it and I therexere request you kindly to do something whereby I _ with snould be living /^assurances of my safety in Shargah .All these deeds have emanated from Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad He dees all these things.

He reports that on evening of Slat January,shortly after two sloops had Idft, his house at Shargah was surrounded by about 100 armed men under Abdur Rahman bin Iv 'ohamed, who demanded release of slaves. Residency Agent was in another house. Some of the leading inhabitants deterred Abdur Rahman from forcibly entering house and reported matter to Shaikh of Shargah, and after about 2 hours men withdrew. Commander.Warship 'Hastings' called on Shaikh for explanation and his only excuse for outragg was ridiculous story that he had heard that warship 'Cyclamen' had landed Khalid,Ex-Shaikh of Shargah and that he was concealed in Residency Agent's house. Shaikh had therefore summoned Abdur Rahman to his assistance in case Khalid attempted to regain Shaikhdom, and his route had led him past the Agency which had given rise to false impression, j It is essential to show Trucial Shaikhs that we will brook no interference with slaves attempting to obtain freedom and expect them to fulfil their treaty obligations, and also will punish severely any insult to Residency Agent. His safety in this primitive part of the world depends entirely on our support. I met him yesterday in Khassab and he informed me personally that he considered it would be unsafe for him to continue to reside in Shargah ujiless serious notice was taken of incident.

There is little doubt but that Shaikh was implicated in the matter, but in any case he gave guarantee for Abdur Rahman' good behaviour when latter returned from Aden and must be held responsible for an outrage committed in his town. I therefore recommend that Abdur Rahman should again be deported to Aden ^or such period as ma;&gt; seem good to Government. Residency Agent considers it improbable however that Shaikh of Shargah will surrender him, and he will probably eKcape into interior. I recommend therefox'e that Shaikh should be caxxef; on (l) to surrender Abdur Rahman on board warship wis.hm 24 hours.

Mes sage No. 123/24th F eb: from The Honourable The Political Resident^XEncIosure TJ which was received at 2030 on 24th Pet), announced the final for the putting into effect of the measures against Sharjah proposed by The Hon: The Political Resident at conference held at Ehasab on 16th February. Admiralty's Provisional Approval of the action contemplated having already been received on 20th Feb: H.M.S.'HASTINGS' proceeded from Henjam the same evening (fsth Feb:) in oeder to arrive off Sharjah at daybreak 25th Feb: to execute the Demands of H.M.Government without delay. 5. A report to the above effect was made at the same 4. On arrival at Sharjah the morning of the 25th Feb:■ it was found that the Residency Agent (Isa) was still absent at Ras-al-Ehaimah where 'HASTINGS' had landed him on 17th Feb A message was sent in to the Sheikh ordering him to repair on board. My messenger on returning reported that he had seen Abdurahman Bin Mohamed in the Sheikh's fort. 5. At 1000 the Sheikh came on board attended by his youngest brother Raschid his ffaafer Said Bin Mohamed (Chief of the local Albu Shams), the leading Sharjah Merchant Khalid Bin Ibrahim and two lesser notables. I informed the Shaikh that in view of:- (a) The fact that Abdurahman Bin Mohamed had surrounded Residency Agent's house on 31st January with armed men and demanded release of the slaves sheltering there Cand) (b) That the Sheikh had given personal guarantee for good behavior of Abdurahman and, further, is under treaty obligation to supDress slavery m his territory. Abdurahman's action constituted an Insult to the British Representative ''and a breach of the Treaty obligations. Accordingly, in the name of the British Government I ordered the Sheikh to produce Abdurahman on board H.M.S. 'HASTINGS' within 24 hours. 6. After the usual protestations of innocence on his own and Abdurahman's behalf, the Sheikh declared he would always obey the Commands of H.M.Government when they were just but not when they were unjust. He (Sheikh) protested that the demand for the surrender of Abdurahman...cv 3% Adurahman was unjust and claimed that the whole case should' first examined tiy the Political Resident in person ashore in the Shardah Agency. ouT I refused to consider this suggestion pointing^that I was but there to execute the order of the H.M.Government who were already satisfied that the offences as stated had been committed. I added, however, that if Abdurahman was surrendered as ordered I would see that he (Abdurahman) was given an opportunity of stating his case before The Honourable The Political Resident. 7. Throughout the interview Sultan Bin Sagar showed great agitation and perpired freely though the weather was cool. On his departure I explained to the Sheikh that I would not fire his salute until the matter was settled to the satisfaction of H.M.Government. 8. At noon (25th Feb:) 'HASTINGS' then proceeded to Ras-al-Khaimah to embark the Residency Agent. This was not accomplished until 1915 at which time 'HASTINGS' ■ sailed again for Sharjah finally taking up her. customary anchorage at 0130 (E6th Feb:) by the aid of searchlight. 9. At noon on E6th Feb:, when time limit of the first demand (surrender of Abdurahman) expired, a deputation from the Sheikh came on board consisting of the fazir Said and the two^^ading merchants - Khalid Bin Ibrahim and Hamid Bin Ali - men^wnoXtravelled and knew India and whose 'Role' was obviously to'talk me round'. 10. On my askinewhy Abdurahman had not been delivered I was told that the Sheikh refused to hand him over until he (Abdurahman) had been tried and proved guilty. The Deputation again pressed that an enquiry should be re-opened on shore. I replied that the time for enquiries had passed and that H.M.Government were satisfied that the case against Abdurahman and the Sheikh v /as as stated in my original demand. Further, I pointed out that Abdurahman had failed to, attend my enquiry on 15th Feb: or to show himself on board at any time ~ actions implying Guilt. I then announced that since the Sheikh had refused to produce Abdurahman, the British Government demanded from him ( the Sheikh) a fine of Rupees 2000 and Rifles 100 to be paid to me within four days. This demand was given in writing - ( Enclosure 2 ) both English and Arabic - as well as verbally. Expiration of time limit was fixed at noon Monday End March and I gave warning that in the event of non-compliance I would proceed to take whatever action I considered necessary to enforce Demands. 11. There followed the usual protestations of poverty and insufficient time and appeals for reduction of the Demands. I declared however, that I was not there to bargain, that the demands had been carefully considered by the British Government and were unalterable, and that it was still open to Sharjah to produce Abdurahman in lieu of the fine. I further announced that I would receive no more deputations unless they came to comply with the demands. 12. In subsequent (Private) conversation with the Residency Agent the two merchants expressed their disgust at the Sheikh's relationship with Abdurahman which had landed them ill in such trouble. On the deputation leaving Commanding Officer's Cabin the ^azir was observed to steal a box of chocolates out of the pavtry.&gt; &amp; is. The following Forenoon (E7th Feb) the Residency Agent came off and reported that in accordance with my orders, he had turned back a i)eputaxion who were proposing to come ans plead for a relaxation of terms. .. ^ There being no further developments 'HASTINGS' sailed at noon for Henjam ha,ving instructed the Residency Agent to go and stay at Adman during my absence. 14. On Sunday 1st March 'HASTINGS' returned, embarked Residency Agent at Ajman, and anchored off Shardan at noon. The same afternoon the Agent was landed and he sent ofi news that the Sheikh had gone to Hirah to raise some rifles. It was also learnt that the Townspeople were very dissatisfied with their Sheikh and were not subscribing at all freely towards the fine. 15. At daybreak Monday End 'FOLKESTONE' arrived from Henjam in accordance with previous^ orders and ancnored m pre- , arranged position suitable for bombardment. . - * In the forenoon it was learnt that Sheikh had collected 60 Rifles from Hirah. . „ About 1100 the Agent's Son Said was landed with instructions to warn the British subjects (Indians) to close up tneir shcos and retire to a safe place and to issue warning that bombardment of the Shargan (East) Tower would start at Midnight unless fine was paid in full. TVs jife was quickly followed by the news that the Sheii-h was coming off at once with part of the fine. ^ n -i „ At 1300 the Sheikh and a large party was observed embarking. The Residency Agent was forthwith sent intercept him and again inform iiim (SheiKii) that I tfould not receive'him unless he brought the whole fine. The Agent found that the Sheikh had with him Rupees 1^0 and 60 Rifles but these were not accepted and the party was turned back with the repeated warning that bombardment would start at midnight unless fine was forthcoming, and that inhabitants of Eastern Suburbs of Town were advised to clear to safety. . In the course of the day both ships cleared for action and live ammunition was ranged where it was most noticeable. 16. At E130 Sheikh Sultan accompanied by his ITazir his young brother Raschid, the merchant Hamid Bin All ano. a iu_l Baggarah load arrived on board and handeu over the Pine in Rupees S000 in one Rupee pieces and 100 01a Model Rifles It^had been' stipulated that all rifles had to be breech - loading Six rifles were not passed and Sheikh was ordered to replace O them by Midnight, otherwise fire would be opened. The six rifles were replaced at S300. 17. At the reauest of the Residency Agent I instructed Commanding Officer_'FOLKESTONE' to send for the notables oi . Shariah the following forenoon to point the moral of t.xe affair -■ lust concluded and to issue warning for Future guidance. ^ • At 0015 March 3rd'HASTINGS' sailed from Sharjah for Basrah.

I thought 'Hastings' was doing so, but apparently this was not altogether the case. Afe* 1 No. ^'7 of 1931. 1 BrltisH Eesldenoy &amp; Ocnsulate-Generalf Bushire, the &amp; ^ March 1931. From The Hon*hie ^t.-Cclcnel H.V. Bisoce, Political Resident In the Persian Gulf. To The Foreign Secretary to the G-overnment cf India, NEW DELHI. Sir, \ I have the honour to invite your attention to vw/ my telegram No. 160, dated the 3rd Maroh^hich I reported that the Shaikh of Shargah had refused to surrender Ahdur Rahman hut had paid up the Rs.2,000 fine and delivered one hundred rifles. 2. I have now received from the Oaptain of H.M.S. 'Hastings'a detailed report of events at Shargaft (K and would therev)submit full account of the incident for the information of the G-overnment of India. 3. Early in January of this year three slaves he- longing either to Ahdur Rahman 'bin Mahomed or inhabi tants of this village, Hira, near Shargah,took refuge in the Residency Agent's house at Shargah, complaining of illtreatment and seeking manumission. On February 6th I received a report hy telegram from the Residency Agent that on the night of January 31st the Shaikh of Shargah accompanied hy Ahdur Rahman and an armed party had surrounded his fepuse and demanded the return of the slaves. The Residency Agent himself at the time was in another house and heard from the villagers of what was happening and it was apparently only through the inter vention of some of the leading Mgrcgte inhabitants of thethe Town that AMur Rahman was prevented from fcrciMy entering the house. H .M,3. 'Hastings' was at Henjam at the time and I telegraphed to her Gaptain, who was in charge k £ in the absence of the Senior Naval Officer in Bombay, asking him to proceed to the Trucial Ooast and make enqtuiries into the facts of the case. On February 16th, while I was at Muscat on tour, I received his reply that the Shaikh had not been present in person but that in other respects the Residency Agents report was correct. He further stated that the only explanation the Shaikh had to offer was a ridiculous story that he had heard a ru mour that H.M.3.'Cyclamen^ which had recently left the Erucial Coast, had landed Khalid, ex-Shaikh of Shargah, and that he was concealed in the Residency Agent's house. The Shaikh had therefore summoned Abdur Rahman to his assistance in case Khalid attempted to regain the Shaikh- dom* His route had led him past the Agency and this had given rise to a false impression. Before definitely deciding the action to be taken I thought it would be as well to discuss the matter verbally with the Captain of H.M,3.'Hastings' and the Residency Agent, and I therefore proceeded in H .M.3. 'Folkestone' to Khassab and met Hastings there, the Residency Agent being on board the latter ship. They there gave me a detailed account of what tuxi happened, and as there seemed no doubt about the facts of the case it was clearly a matter that called for prompt action, firstly, in order to show the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast that we would brook no interference with slaves seeking their freedom and secondly to protect my Agent on this Coast, who lives without a guard of any kind. Khan Bahadur Isa informed me that unless some- s - ■ some immediate action was taken, the prestige of His Majesty's G-cvernment on whichL depended his safety, would suffer a serious set 'back and that it would iiot te safe for him to remain any longer at Shargah, though he would serve anywhere else on the Ooast. After this interview I despatched my telegram No.T.39 to the Government of India describing what had taken place and recommanding that the Shaikh should he called upon to surrender Ahdur Bahman on board ship within 24 hours or failing this to pay a fine of Hs.2,000 and 100 rifles within 4 days. In the event of non compliance I recemmended that the ksoee warship should he authoriaed, after giving due notice, to destroy a tower outside the town. On tiie 24th February, I received intimation that my proposals were approved and at once telegraphed to the Oaptain of H. M .S. 'Hastings' A to arrange to deliver the ultimatum. On the morning of the 25th Pehruary^ the Oaptain of the 'Hastings* interviewed the Shaikh on board his ship and called upon him to deliver Atdur Bahman within 24 hours. It was further explained to him that until he had complied with the demands of His Majesty's Government his salute would not he fired. At noon on the following day at the expiration of the ultimatum, a deputation from the Shaikh arrived on 'board. Ahdur Baaman was not present and it was clear that their intention was to procastinate and if possible to oogve some modification in the terms of the ultimatum. It was then explained to them that the time for talking was past and that as Abdur Bahman had not 'been produced His Majesty's Government requireskthe Shaikh to pay Bs. 2,000 fine and deliver 100 rifles. Further, if this order was not complied with by fcoon, Monday the 2nd March, the Gaptain would take whatever action he considerec necessary to enforce the demands.About 11 a.m. on Maroli 2nd, the son of the Residency Agent was sent ashore with instructions to warn British subjects that unless the fine was paid in full, firing would start at midnight. A dout 1 p.m. the Shaikh with a large following was observed on the oeach. The Residency Agent was sent ashore to warn him that unless he had 'brought the full amount of the fine, he would iiot 'be received. He was found to have brought only Rs.1290 and 60 rifles and the party was turned hack. At 9.30 p.m. the Shaikh arrived on 'board, accom panied 'by his Wazir, his younger brother and a few merchants He paid the fine in full and handed over 100 old model rifles, malAly Martini*450. It had 'been stipulated that all rifles should 'be 'breech loading and serviceable —-six rifles were not passed and the Shaikh was ordered to replace them by midnight. The six rifles were replaced by 11 p.m. I think that the imposition of this fine and the surrender of the rifles will probably have Just as good an effect as the deportation of Abdur Rahman would have had. It has touched the pockets of the Shaikh and the leading inhabitants and they may be trusted to curb Abdur Rahman's activities in future, while I understand that the leading inhabitants have given a serious warning to the Shaikh. The promptness with which action was taken undoubtedly impressed the population and it will serve^a useful object lesson tc the Shaikh^of the Trucial Coast that the British G-cvernment intend to insist that they shall act up to their treaty obligations as regards slavery, and will pro tect their representative. I wish also to express my appreciation of the-n - 5 ! —,1 the manner in Wiiloli tiie situation was handled 'by Oommander ^acgrath 01* H.H.3.'Hastings 1 ' and to express my thanks to the Senior Naval Officer for placing siiips at my disposal.

The Shaikh did not agree to this saying that if there was anything against Abdur Rahman it should be dealt with through him. A long conversation took place between them v /ith the result that the Oaptain told the Shaikh that he ordered him to bring Abdur Katiman on board warship in 24 hours time. The Shaikh then landed. The time having elapsed the Shaikh sent to the warship a few notables of Shargah to intimate that AMur .nahman had escaped to the desert, thereupon the uaptain issued an Order to 'the Shaikh, copy of which is attached herewith for your information.

My enquiries from some Baluchis regarding the said Sanqur show that he is right in saying that Hekran Baluchis kidnapped and sold him away.

He took me to v-itar and taught me diving. I first worked as a boy and later on as a puller and afterwards as a diver.

In these cases, the Residency Agent at Sharjah (‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif) wrote to the Political Resident at Bushire, enclosing a statement made by the slave(s), and advising whether he believed the slave (or slaves) should be manumitted. The Political Resident replied, informing ‘Īsá that he may do so.Three subjects in the file are extraordinary in nature, as follows:Subject 9 is a manumission case involving a women who took refuge with the Resident Agent in Sharjah in 1926, with her four children. The woman claimed that she was originally a free person who had been enslaved with her four children. Included in the subject correspondence (folio 108) is a handwritten manumission certificate (in Arabic) given to the woman by her mother, stating that the mother and her children were free people. The certificate is a unique example in the Bushire Slavery subject files of a handwritten manumission certificate, given to a slave by their owner.Subject 10 contains letters written in 1925 to the Political Resident (then Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Crosthwaite) from the shaikhs of Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ajman, Ra's al-Khaymah and Umm al-Qaywayn (folios 120-23, 129). The letters were a coordinated response between the Trucial Coast shaikhs, communicating their unhappiness about indebted slaves absconding from their boat masters, and the Political Resident’s perceived inaction on the matter. Each letter was sent to the Political Resident at the same time. The Political Resident responded by saying that he took the matter seriously, and requested the shaikhs to send details of absconding divers to him. The shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah responded by sending details to the Political Resident of a number of divers’ balance books, that showed their level of debt and earningsSubject 30 documents an incident on the evening of 31 January 1931, when one-hundred armed men surrounded the Residency Agent’s house in Sharjah, demanding the return of a number of slaves. The incident was reported to the Political Resident, and HMS
                              Hastingsdispatched to monitor the situation. Testimonies identified the ringleader of the armed gang as an associate of the shaikh of Sharjah, Saqr bin Sultan. British officials gave the shaikh an ultimatum to deport the man to Aden. Refusal to do so would result in the shaikh having to hand over 2,000 rupees and 100 rifles to British officials. The Political Resident and the Senior Naval Officer in the Gulf agreed that refusal to do this could result in the town being bombarded (folio 373). The shaikh refused to deport the ringleader, and on the day of the ultimatum, he delivered up 1,200 rupees and 60 rifles. This offer was refused by the Commanding Officer of HMS
                              Hastings(389). Within hours of the ultimatum expiring the Shaikh delivered 2000 rupees and 100 rifles, but was ordered to replace six rifles that were found to not be in working order (folio 395).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indentured labour</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000b5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
