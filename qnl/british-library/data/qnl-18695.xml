Many of the important details in this letter have been lost because the edge of one side of the folio is missing. A note on the verso of the folio states that this copy was originally enclosed in a letter from Porter, dated 7 April.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023612308.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
