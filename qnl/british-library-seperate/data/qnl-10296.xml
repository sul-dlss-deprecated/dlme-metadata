The impact of this development upon relations between Bin Saud and the British Government generally is also discussed, notably the need to maintain neutrality in the conflict between him and the Ottomans. This discussion includes mention of the importance of maintaining the independence of Qatar and the states of the Trucial Coast vis-à-vis Bin Saud.The correspondence in the file is primarily between officials at the Political Residency in Bushire, the Government of India's Foreign Department and the Political Agency in Bahrain but also includes a limited amount of correspondence (in English translation) between Bin Saud and British officials.In addition to correspondence, the file contains a document entitled 'Memorandum of Interview with Bin Saud on 15th-16th December 1913' written by the Political Agent in Bahrain, Arthur Prescott Trevor, and the Political Agent in Kuwait, William Henry Irvine Shakespear (folios 24-25).The file contains an index on folio 2 that lists all the letters contained in the file with details of the correspondents and the date.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Al-Hasa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000257#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000257#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000257#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000257#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
