Article 46 of the Labour Law prescribes that all regulations necessary under the law shall be submitted to the Council of Ministers before 18th May, 1947, and the law itself requires twenty-one different regulations on all aspects of labour and social welfare. Goaded by article 46 the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda hurriedly prepared and obtained the approval of the Council of Ministers to the following regulations :—■ (а) High Labour Council—constitution and functions (article 34 of the Labour Law). Approved on 7th August, 1946. (б) Factory Councils (article 27 of the Labour Law) approved on 28th August. 1946. (c) Minimum Wage Regulations (articles 24-26 of the Labour Law) approved on 24th October, 1946. (d) Arbitration procedure and Boards for Settlement of Disputes (articles 29-31 of the Labour Law) approved on 23rd November, 1946. The experience gained in the drafting of these regulations and in their subsequent administration proved to the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda that legislation under the Labour Law must be a long-term process based on studies and analyses and cannot be confined within a time limit. The previous urge to fill the statute book with hastily prepared legislation has since December been succeeded by healthy caution; the Ministry now appears to be striving for quality of legislation rather than quantity. 2. During December 1946 and January 1947 the following draft regulations were considered by the Ministry :— (a) Individual and Collective Contracts of Service. —Preliminary discussion of these draft regulations revealed divergence of opinion on main principles, and the Ministry has suspended further action until an alternative draft has been prepared. (b) Regulations regarding Health and Aid Funds (article 37 of Labour Law).—These were prepared within the Ministry and submitted to the Under-Secretary who wisely decided that they were premature and that it was necessary to obtain more detailed statistics and the advice of a specialist on insurance questions. He therefore suspended any further consideration of the draft and arranged for a team of inspectors to visit selected factories to make a complete analysis of the incidence and duration of sickness, accidents and unemployment. It is anticipated that sufficient information will be available by the end of February to enable an insurance scheme to be prepared on a reasonably firm actuarial basis. (c) Trade Union Regulations (article 21 of the Labour Law).—Although in October 1946, the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda professed readiness to issue regulations giving legal status to trade unions and pre scribing a simple procedure for their formation, there has been little positive action. The study of draft regulations was delayed on various pretexts, the real reason no doubt 86-1452 being political expediency—the desire to procrastinate until the Tudeh monopoly influence on the workers had been finally broken. The Prime Minister has now issued personal instructions that there shall be no further delay in the issue of trade union regulations and a special committee has been appointed by the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda to prepare a draft for early sub mission to the High Labour Council. (d) Health and Protection of Workers .— Draft regulations are being methodi cally prepared by a committee of workers, employers and Government officials. There is little or no existing legislation on this subject and the committee’s field must therefore embrace all aspects of health, wel fare and protection. Progress is slow but the regulations that are eventually presented to the Council of Ministers will be sound and adequate. (e) Workmen's Compensation .—Decrees of 21st November, 1943, and 12th November, 1944, established a limited scheme of workmen’s com pensation. Regulations to extend the scheme to the whole of Persian industry, to simplify contribution rates, and to increase benefits are being prepared in committee and are practically complete. (f) In addition to the preparation of the foregoing regulations the Ministry is drafting a revised Labour Law. Experience has proved that the existing law contains anomalies and is inadequate in many respects. A special committee has therefore been appointed by the Ministry to study and revise the law and. during January, good progress has been made in redrafting. The committee proposes to extend the scope of the law to include manual and clerical workers in all occupations except domestic service, the distributive trades and agriculture. The Ministry of War has refused to accept the application of the law to civilian workers in War Department factories and has threatened to con script workers into the armed forces and compel them to wear uniform if this is the only means of avoiding compliance with the law. The committee is still seeking a com promise solution. 3. To assist the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda in the study of labour ques tions and to draft legislation for submission to the High Labour Council, employers’ and workers’ representatives have been appointed to special committees which meet regularly at the Ministry’s headquarters- Committees for Settlement of Dispute^ Protection of Industries; Protection of Labour; Social Insurance; Health and Aid Funds; Programmes and Planning; and Employment, are now functioning with enthusiasm although material results have as yet been small. Study of labour problems is handicapped by the complete absence of national statistics or data, and by the in experience and insecurity in appointment of ministerial personnel—both senior and junior officers are in continual circulation from one post to another and have no oppor tunity of acquiring specialised knowledge or of contributing materially to the study of any particular subject. A dministration 4. The administrative machinery of the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda has recently been reviewed on the instructions of Minister Aramesh, and the Labour departments are in process of reorganisa tion and expansion. There is now a clearer definition of function and responsibility from the Under-Secretary, Naficy (who previously was reluctant to delegate authority) through four directors-general to the separate departments and branches. There is still, however, a marked reluctance of new and inexperienced officials to con centrate on the more elementary and basic problems of labour administration. They prefer to spend time and effort developing, on paper, highly imaginative schemes and individual theories, many of which are more properly within the field of another Government department, e.g., welfare and training of women prisoners, price control of the products of home industries. Naficy, who is working under pressure in a sea of detail, finds it difficult to give firm direc tives and exercise close control over the activities of his staff. 5. Employment bureaux are functioning at Tehran, Isfahan, Meshed, Ahwaz, Ker man. Yezd and Sari, and a bureau should now have opened in Tabriz. Plans are well advanced for establishing a further eighteen offices. In order to staff the bureaux candidates of specified educational standard are admitted to a three months’ training course at the Ministry’s head quarters. If successful in the final exam ination they are assigned to the provinces with the rank of inspector, to establish employment bureaux and to give effect to the provisions of the labour law. Theemployment bureaux are at present placing agencies only, registration procedure is rudimentary and few employers notify vacancies to the bureaux. ^Industrial Relations 6. In the sphere of labour relations there is an apparently sincere effort on the part of the Government (stimulated by the Prime Minister himself) to improve employer-worker relationship. The Fac tory Council Regulations approved by the Council of Ministers on 28th August, 1946. for long remained a dead letter. To make the regulations effective by encouraging the formation of councils throughout Persian industry would have given new life and power to the Tudeh Trade Union movement which politically was being rapidly dis credited. The successful conclusion of the Azerbaijan campaign of December 1946 further swung popular opinion against Tudeh organisations, and the time seemed opportune for the Government to foster the development of factory councils and nego tiating machinery. A senior official of the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda was assigned to the industrial centre of Isfahan to inaugurate councils in private industries and, early in January, the formation of councils in the Tehran State tobacco factory, the sugar factory and the Tehran power station was announced. By the end of January it was claimed that fifty-six councils were operating in Tehran. Con currently, the Governor-General of Khuzis- tan undertook to give full assistance to the local Ministry of Labour representatives in their efforts speedily to establish factory councils in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company areas. The Minister of Labour and Propa ganda himself proposes to visit Khuzistan in February to observe progress and to encourage the activities of the councils. 7. Political fears and influences still impede the full development of trade unionism in Persia. The Tudeh trade union with its central committee, provincial offices and factory branches throughout industry was a highly organised movement with a large nominal membership. (In Isfahan alone a membership of 45,000 was claimed.) The Government’s action to discredit the political basis of the Tudeh movement, the accumulation of evidence of alleged malpractices of the leaders, and the arrest and imprisonment of those respon sible for disorders and violence, left the workers disillusioned and suspicious. They still show little spontaneous en thusiasm and they are reluctant to take initiative in developing alternative types of association. The first reaction of the Government was in favour of the development of a Demo cratic Party trade union in opposition to the Tudeh union and, during December, Ministry of Labour officials actually organised such unions in Tehran and Isfahan. This policy has now been some what modified and Minister of Labour and Propaganda. Aramesh, recently made a firm and apparently sincere public declara tion that associations of workers would be fostered and encouraged without regard to poiitical membership. The trade union regulations now being finally drafted should grant, in law at least, complete free dom of association without prejudice or favour. In anticipation of early issue of the regulations the Minister of Labour and Propaganda is sounding selected ex-Tudeh union spokesmen (Jowdat of Tehran, Fidaker of Isfahan) who have forcefully expressed disillusionment and disappoint ment in their former leaders with a view to encouraging them to organise more demo cratic associations. 8. The Tudeh Central Committee of Trade Unions is not yielding ground without resistance. In December it despatched a telegram complaining of victimisation and oppression to the World Federation of Trade Unions, and asked that a delegation from the federation should visit Persia. The Prime Minister strongly objected to the Central Com mittee’s action and was at first determined to refuse permission for a delegation to enter the country. He recently decided, however, that whilst he will not officially invite a W.F.T.U. delegation, he will not place any obstacle in the way of a visit. At the same time and as a counter move he has officially invited the I.L.O. to send observers to Persia to investigate the allegations. The Central Committee’s most recent attempt to save face was by a declaration in the press on 8th January that the committee is not attached to any party or political group and that its sole aims are protection of the rights of the worker and restoration of constitutional principles. In spite of this claim it has also been announced that the Tudeh Party Executive Committee will operate a purge of the Central Committee’s leaders. 9. Boards for Settlement of Disputes have been established under the regulations approved on 23rd November, 1946, in the larger employment areas. The boards have an increasing volume of work con sisting almost entirely of complaints under chapter 7 of the Labour Law against alleged wrongful dismissal. They have, asyet, little experience of major negotiations, trade disputes or strikes. During Decem ber the four boards functioning in Tehran dealt with 160 cases affecting 1,537 workers. The policy of the boards in their early days was to give a strong bias in favour of the worker and less consideration was given to the merit of a complaint than to the political desire to attract workers to statutory machinery and procedure in preference to putting complaint and grievance into the hands of Tudeh unions. It was, in fact, stated by high officials of the Ministry of Labour that until workers had formed the habit of making use of statutory machinery the boards would avoid giving decisions with which workers might be dissatisfied. Wages 10. Although minimum wage regulations were approved on 24th October, 1946, it was not until 20th January, 1947, that a monetary minimum wage of 34 rials per day was announced for Tehran. The “ basket ” of items and quantities as laid down in the Minimum Wage Regulations has been priced at this figure for Tehran much to the dissatisfaction of workers’ representatives who had expected pricing to be not less than 50 rials. Employers’ representatives on the High Labour Council were themselves convinced that a fair price for the “ basket ” would be approximately 40 rials per day and they would, no doubt, have accepted this as a minimum wage. Government representatives are, however, reluctant to lay themselves open to a charge of contributing to internal inflation, and they feel that although the bare minimum wage may be inadequate they have at least taken the first step in statutory wage regu lation and they can progress from this point. The “basket” for Khuzistan has been priced by Ministry of Labour inspec tors at approximately 40 rials, and the Khuzistan Board for Settlement of Dis putes will meet during the first week in February to study the inspectors’ recom mendations and to prescribe the monetary wage. The Minister of Labour and Propaganda proposes making a public announcement of the new rate when he visits Khuzistan towards the end of Feb ruary. Although inspectors have been working in other provinces for many week&amp; pricing local “baskets” the only result has been a figure of 54 rials for Yezd, and the inspector’s recommendation has been summarily rejected by his headquarters; he has been reprimanded for arriving at figure in excess of the Tehran rate. General 11. During January the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda has endeavoured to widen international contacts and especially to strengthen links with the International Labour Organisation. Jamalzadeh, a Per sian permanent official at the International Labour Office, has been officially invited to return to Persia for a short time to study recent developments in the Labour sphere and to impart his own knowledge and advice concerning international practices. As already reported, an invitation has also been sent to the International Labour Office requesting the early despatch of a delega tion to investigate complaints made by the Tudeh Central Committee of Trade Unions alleging oppression of workers by the Government. Persia will be represented at the I.L.O. Petroleum Committee meeting in Los Angeles in February by Messrs. Nayer Nouri and Pirnia, who are senior officials of the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Finance respectively. The uncertain trade union situation made it difficult to select bona fide and suitable workers’ representatives to attend the com mittee, and this made it inappropriate to invite employers’ representatives to attend. It was therefore decided that Persia should be represented by Government observers only. It was at one stage hoped that the Minister of Labour and Propaganda would attend at Los Angeles but the Prime Minister was unable to agree that Aramesh should be absent from Persia during the election period. After the Los Angeles Conference Nayer Nouri will remain in Washington as Attache of the Ministry of Labour and Propaganda. It is the first appointment of this nature to be made by the Persian Government and, if successful, further appointments will follow. K. J.

In July last the Labour Attach# to His Majesty's Smbaasy at Cairo dlscuseed the main features of a minimum wage scheme with the Director General of the Persian Ministry of Labour. A special Sub-Committee of the Supreme Labour Council then held frequent meetings to draft the Regulations. Workers' and employers' representatives were members of the Sub-Committee and agreed the final draft. 3. The chief difficulty encountered during the preparation of the Regulations was in obtaining general agreement to the principle that minimum wages should bs translated Into items of cost of living. Earlier proposals had been to Impose a 'bad climate” allowance of 25^ of existing wages, and the long and tedious arguments on this issue were reported to you in my telegram Ho.1538 of 24th September and SavIngram Ho.54 of the 11th October. Pinal agreement as embodied in the present Regulations requires the identification of minimum needs of food, housing and clothing, their quantitative assessment, and then pricing and conversion into a monetary wage rate. Under Article 8 of the Regulations there will be three of these 'baskets”, for moderate climates, hot climates, and the South Coast and the Kavir Desert. This seems as satisfactory a conclusion as any to an extremely difficult problem, and it has the merit that it has been accepted by workers' and employsrs' representatives• 4. Article 9 of the Regulations is a commendable attempt to grade workers according to skill and ability and to formulate national standards for classification and comparison This section of the Regulations was drafted without undue argument or delay. 5. The Articles dealing with woman woekers (Article 7) an trainee* (Article 9 Mote 2) are less adequate and may require amplification later. Whilst male minimum rates are to bo assessed regionally on standards prescribed by the Supreme labour Council, and women employed on equal work with men receive equal pay (Article 24 of the Labour Law), there appears to be no national or regional regulation of the ratea for women employed on purely womens' work. Their wages are Cou b ~V^r 0 b n8d i° r f.P*rat. factory by the Factory Council or, if the establishment is large, by any one of a nupoer of Councils •.

The regulations do not make provision for the worker who is below average or suffering from physical defect or infirmity. It has been pointed out to the Ministry of Labour that the result may be the discharge of many aged or less efficient workers for jrhom alternative employment may not be available. 7. Hote 1 to Article 9 illustrates the Supreme Labour Council's anxiety to keep a measure of control and supervision over the operation of their first ventures into labour legislation. They are In almost continuous session and their immediate programme Includes preparation of Regulations on Trade Dlsputes &gt; Trade Unions, Dismissal of Workers, Health and Safety Precautions, Dangerous Work, Aid Funds, and also revision of the Labour Law. Their proposal under Article 9 to approve, presumably after scrutiny, hundreds of lists containing thousands of names and categories seems unduly optimistic. * 8.

NMD. 9/8/46.1 HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT b}' tbe Council of Ministers on the 18th May, 1946. Although the law has not yet been formally promulgated, I understand that it will take effect ten days after publication of its text in the Official Gazette. 2. It will be observed that a 48-hour week is provided for, and that overtime must not exceed four hours in any one day, with an annual maximum of 600 hours for seasonal industries and 400 hours for other industries. Overtime pay is to be 35 per cent, in excess of ordinary wages. In its draft form the Bill specified that overtime pay should be 50 per cent, extra, but this was modified as a result of representations made by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 3. The original Bill also provided that Friday should be a holiday, and that a full day’s wages should be paid for this day. The law has, however, been slightly modified and now provides that, if an employer does not pay his workmen wages for Ft idays, he is bound to fix their weekly wages in such a manner that the wages paid them for six days shall cover their requirements for a week. 4. One of the most important sections of the law is chapter 10, which piovides for the settlement of disputes. This section is of great interest in view of the labour difficulties at present experienced by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Article 27 provides for the establishment at each factory of a council to be known as the Factory Council composed of one representative from the workmen of the factory, one representative from the employer, and a representa tive of the Department-General of Labour. In its draft form the Bill stated that, should the official representative not be available, he could nominate a substitute from the employees of the factory. This provision would have weighted the scales against the employers, as the official representative could at any time shelve his responsibility by going away and leaving the employers’ representative in a minority. 5. In the case of individual disputes the decision of the Factory Council is to be final and binding. Disputes of a more general nature, involving a number of workmen or a union of workers or of employers, if not settled by the Factory Council, are to be referred to an Arbitration Board, composed of one arbitrator nominated by the employer and one nominated by the workmen. Should they fail to agree, an umpire is to be appointed by mutual consent. If the Arbitration Boa id fails to settle the dispute within twenty days, or the arbitrators refuse to give an award, the question is to be referred for solution to the Board for Settlement of Disputes, composed of the local Governor or his representative, the senior legal representative or his representative, the local representative of the Department-General of Labour, two representatives of the workmen, and two representatives of the employer. The award of this board must be ’^iven within twenty days and is to be final and binding. 6. Lock-outs and strikes are forbidden before the expiration of the periods mentioned above. Persons inciting others by threats or force to go on strike, or preventing them from striking, are liable to imprisonment from one to thre^ 7. The new law marks an important step forward in social legislation in this country, and its provisions are on the whole reasonable. There was an urgent need to protect the interests of labour, to regulate the relations between the workman and his employer, and it is to be hoped that the machinery provided for settlement of industrial disputes will be of real value to the oil company, who can now invoke the provisions of the law in their dealings with their employees. 8.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a report by the press attach^ Lf- , on the internal situation, in continuation of the report which was enclosed in mV a LS despatch No. 4 of the 21st February last to the Minister of Information (despatch 1 ~ c \ No. 35 to you). ~ ^ ss Lambton has done well to raise the question of the attitude that should be adopted by His Majesty’s Government if there should be a movement against the Shah strong enough to drive him from his capital if not from the country. The question is now of great importance, in view of the fact that German intrigues are trying to foment internal trouble in Syria, Palestine and Iraq, and that public opinion in Iran is almost solidly against the Shah and almost as solidly persuaded that the Shah would not be on the throne were it not for the British. The question is of too great urgency to be dealt with only in a despatch, and I therefore propose not to comment further here, but to raise the question by telegram. 3. A copy of this despatch and enclosure is being forwarded to the Ministry of Information; the Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office; the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department; His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Angora, Bagdad and Moscow; and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. iH 'Vr £ Enclosure. Miss Lambton to Sir R. Bullard. (Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, May 1 , 1941. I HAVE the honour to refer to my despatch of the 21st February, 1941, and to transmit to you the following report :— 2. The improvement in the state of public opinion noted in my above- mentioned despatch has not been maintained. Enemy, and especially German, victories in the Balkans and North Africa have caused us to lose what ground we had gained. It is true, however, that increasing American aid and the pronounce ments of American leaders have done something to prevent a complete collapse of our stock. It is, moreover, interesting to note that the older army officers, though not, in general, the younger, are disposed to believe that, whatever defeats we may suffer at present and in the near future, we shall eventually be victorious. 3. The coup d'Etat in Iraq did not arouse much general interest locally. The Germans and their friends attempted, and still attempt, to make out that it was accomplished with Axis support. Generally speaking, this propaganda has been ineffective. The Persians cannot believe that, Iraq being, as they firmly believe, our puppet, we could possibly have allowed the Axis to gain influence there. A coup d'Etat engineered by the Axis was therefore, as they see it, quite out of the question, and hence they suppose that it was some deep-laid British plan which demanded for its accomplishment that a semblance of pro-Axis tendencies be given to the coup d'Etat. 4. The arrival of Imperial troops in Basra after the coup d’Etat in Iraq had, on the whole, a reassuring effect on our friends, while it annoyed our enemies. It was the occasion for German and pro-German circles to indulge in violent ri9—94] RECd. POL. DEPt; UAUG1941 I 'D IA OFFICE2 anti-British propaganda. The*chief result, however, of the arrival of Imperial troops in Basra has been to bring home to Iranians the nearness of the war to Iran, and, as the cause of the realisation of such an unpleasant fact, it has not been a welcome event, and has given rise to considerable anxiety. 5. The general belief that Turkey will not fight is maintained. There are various reasons for this, among them an innate dislike of the Turks which seeks to fasten on any grounds for abuse of them; in other words, the Persians would like to see them default on their treaty obligations in order that their already low r opinion of the Turks may be reinforced. Also, if the Turks do not fight, there is less likelihood of Iran having to fight, and there are few Persians to whom the possibility of remaining at peace does not appeal. Lastly, there is the fact that German propaganda has been actively pushing the idea that Turkey will not fight. 6 . The chief preoccupation, as war draws nearer to Iran, is, needless to say, the attitude of Russia. It is feared that Russia may occupy Northern Iran either with the consent of Germany, who, it is thought, may have offered Russia Northern Iran in return for Russian acquiescence in German conquests elsewhere, or in order to safeguard her own interests against an advancing and aggressive Germany. The hope that the Russian menace may be removed once and for all by a German victory is thus no longer widely entertained; both in the event of Russo-German co-operation or of Russo-German opposition, it seems to the Iranians that they are in danger from the Russians. 7. In spite of the undoubted anxiety and fear to which the approach of war &gt; towards Iran gives rise, the apparent likelihood of German intervention in Iran ! is generally welcomed. There is, of course, a minority of pro-British Persians who regret—I would not say oppose—it, and a small minority (who are not necessarily anti-German) whose material interests are bound up with the continuance of affairs as they are and therefore do not want any change. For the rest, there are the minority who are pro-German by conviction, and the vast majority of the people who hate the Shah and consistently attribute his sins to the British Government. These sections of the people would welcome any change, except perhaps the coming of the Russians, though there are some who would even welcome this. To such • people even the spread of war to Iran seems preferable to the continuance of the present regime, but it should not be supposed that they contemplate active j participation by Iran in the war, but rather that the present Government will be overthrown by German intervention. They reason that the disorders which would inevitably result from the extension of the war to Iran would enable them to get rid of the present regime; indeed, they conceive that as the only way in which the removal of the Shah can be secured. Among those who hope for this r reason for German intervention in Iran are the army officers mentioned in para graph 2 , who, although they tend to consider that we shall be victorious in the end, believe that the only way to get a change of Government is German interven tion in Iran. British intervention could only be expected to perpetuate the present regime, which, as has so often been stated, is in local opinion the puppet of the British : hence they hope German intervention to bring about the change desired. With the exception possibly of a few army officers and others, the idea that Iran should fight in the event of an aggression against her is not entertained. The general attitude is that, apart from the fact that Iran is obviously too weak to be able to stand up to either the Germans or the Russians, there is no reason for them to fight : they hate the Shah, and so why, they ask, should they fight to perpetuate his rule, and as for fighting to preserve their independence, what with the Shah and the British they do not consider they have any independence. Let the Germans come, they argue, for they will help us to get rid of the Shah, and after that we will see. 8 . With regard to the attitude of the Shah himself, there seems reason to believe that the present situation is causing him much anxiety. There also seems reason to suppose that he will be guided by opportunism and will turn to which ever side appears to him to offer the most immediate gain to himself. It is thought j that he does not entertain the possibility of resistance by Iran to aggression by Germany or Russia, and that if he could buy off either he would do so, whatever the true interests of his country demanded. 9. It would appear that it is now time to consider our policy towards the Shah in the event of a German or Russian occupation of Northern Iran, which canno longer be regarded merely as a remote possibility. Should we in that case give our blessing and support to a Government set up, say, in Fars or Khuzistan, under the aegis of the Shah or give him refuge in some British vessel in the Persian Gulf, with promises of restoration? Such a policy would, it seems to me, be fatal. If ^^we did so, we should confirm the population in their belief that the Shah was our puppet and in their dislike of us for that reason, and convince them even more firmly that their only hope lies in the Germans. It would also effectively dispose of any hope of a Persian revival opposed to German or Russian influence and of the hope that we could occupy the south of Iran with the goodwill of the popula tion. Clearly a question such as this, which concerns policy, is beyond the scope of this report and of my work as press attache, but I have drawn attention to it because of the influence it is likely to have on public opinion.

My Lord, I have the honour to report that the Shah*s return from a visit to his northern estates and to the Turkoman races has resulted in a crop of arrests* as not infrequently happens. ihe most important of those who have had the misfortune to incur the Shah s displeasure are Murteza Quli Samsam Bakhtiari (No. 49 in Personalities) and Amir Seham-ud-Din Ghaffari (No. 89 in Personalities). The former was the last of the important Bakhtiari Khans to escape trouble. He was detained by the police for two days, and then released. No reason for this has yet transpired. Amir Seham-ud-Din Ghaffari has recently been head of the Government industrial school (“hunaristan), and was reported to have c 0 me under Nazi influence, a thing which his German education and the presence of numerous Germans participating in the industrial development of this country would render quite likely. No reason for his arrest and that of his eldurly father on 21st November has been given, and no one has been allowed to see them. But he is still drawing his salary in prison as head of the industrial school, while the police are examining his 'dossier', and the general rumour connects him with a design to form a sort of Nazi party in Iran. The remaining arrests, said to number about thirty, include some army officers, and the charges are said to be varied.

The preparations made for Hie Imperial Majesty's arrival and the state of excitement which reigned here before end during the visit are constant features of such occasions and are therefore not worth describing. I therefore propose to relate only the special features of Hia Majesty's visit. &amp;• Actually, the visit started in rethar unfortun? te circumstances. On rbout the 4th March, a violent reinstom damaged the railway line and blocked the motor road between Bel&gt;-rttd end Uazu. Repairs were started but a further storm did still more damage with the result that for some time it looked as if His Imperial iisjeej&amp;y's train would not be able to pass. tii .4^. ruggeetion was made to the fh? h that he should postpone his visit but this proposal was firmly rejected. 3. However hundreds of coolies were drafted into the area and thanks to a very creditable effort on the /part Seymour, Require, C.U.G., C.v.o. f His Britannic Bajeaty's Minister, etc., cto., etc., British Legation, Tehranpert of the railway engineers heeded by .Aqa Mushar, the newly promoted head of the Bnllw&amp;yo, the tr f etc had been sufficiently repaired to permit the royal train to pass on the 7th instent. 4. A bout midday on th* 8th instant Hie Imperial Majesty arrived at Alnras where the station *nd approach roads were crowded with aightsuere. lie was obliged to make an undignified exit from the train as the military band struck up the Iranian national anthem too soon. 6. Thet afternoon, Hie Majesty decided to make a detailed inspection on foot of the new buildings etc. on the right bank of the rerun. In the course of hie walk he entered the right bank depot of the Anglo Irani n Oil Company where Hr. rettinson, the General Manager of the Comp ny together with Aqa Qawaml, the Ahwaz jnanager had, by a lucky chance, arrived just ft few minutes before the 8hah himself. When Mr. Pattineon wfs presented to the Shwh, the latter said he recognised Mr. Pettineon. It ie eleven ye^rs since they rant, so the recognition if indeed spontaneous, is surprising. The Shah then inspected the depot and asked why the Company did not revet the b nks and make © proper port there. ir. rattinson said th t within six months this work, which the Compriny had in ©ny case proposed to do, would be completed. Hr. Pf'.ttinson said the Shah seemed quite friendly. Hs added th t he was ver^ pleased that he had been present as he had thus learn^t for hiiaself the Bhih's wishes instead of receiving a garbled version of them. 6. Leaving the depot, His Majesty turned to go out by an unfrequented path. Mr. Aettinson warned him that the choaen path was rough but His Majesty persisted. With a few yards there w«s a steep grriesy bank and on this the Bhah’s foot slipped and he fell heavily. Mr. Pattinson • /and3 and others rushed forward to assifet the roy *1 visitor tout before they could get there. His Majesty had regained his feet exclaiming *It is nothing*. He turned to r. Pattinson and snowed him the sole of his shoe,(which whs of the ©oft heelless variety) to explain the cause of his fall. ?. His t4ajeety continued hie tour of inspection and next visited the experimental garden kept toy the Agricultural department. Here he displayed grest interest in the trees end flowers, Risking which varieties thrived best here. After visiting other parts, His vtjesty returned to the railway bungalow set aside for hie use having walked for a total of three hours. 8. The next day he was expected to visit the town of Ahwaz in th~ morning and attend a military parade in the afternoon but Hie Majesty did not leave his quarters during the whole day. It later became known that as a result of hie fall on the previous dvy. His Majesty had damAged his right hund which hud swollen. Military doctors were called on to attend him. ''he rovernor General was received in audience for one hour during which time he received orders to set aside a piece of land on the right bank for the construction of a palace. The Governor General appesrs to have taken fsdvrmtage of this interview to explain that the scheme ordered from Tchr n for the repair and draining of the streets of hwrz had made little progress as financial sanction had been received only when /iq® v uruher, then Minister of the Interior h^d visited Ahw z on 9th February. 9. Jr the morning of the 10th His ©Jeety accompanied by the Governor General p»ld another brief visit to the river bank and selected another site (in lieu of the one first chosen) for the construction of /hishis p*lace, tie said he would send engineers to ..hwez to etert the woric inmiediately on hi a return. The final Bite chosen is i«rnedi»tely opposite the Bite of the proposed Consulate. The Shfih also ordered the construc tion of boulevards on each bank of the river. 10. In the afternoon, ha w nt to the military parade. RealiBinp that the troops h»d be^n ewe i ting his arrival since the laorninr he dismissed the parade after a march past. Kroro the p«r: de ground he returned to the berracke and there inspected the brthrooms, arsenal, anti-craft perk and the aerodrome. He spent an hour in the railiti&gt;ry hospital. He constantly praised the work General u*ini had done here. 11. That evening, the £h h told General Shahbnkhtl, the new General Officer Commanding, in the presence of the Ustandfr, to supervise the civil activities of the Province in the same way as General &amp;u f ini did. General chahbakhti has since sent two letters to the ; unicipality one to state thet no money must be spent without his consent &amp;nd the other ordering the purchase of e motor watering sprayer for the streets. 1v. On the morning of the 11th, His Imperial Majesty left for Hander l hehour. Ac:cording to all accounts, this port h ? d been coisipletely cleaned up for the visit ^.nd the signs of ch«os covered up. An Iranian sloop sent around from Khorrarishahr fir^d a salute of twenty one guns when the Gh*h eppeered on the Jetty. As • proof of his interest in the port and Iso as » tribute to his sources of information, I might mention that His Majesty astounded everyone by enquiring if the hammer which had been loet from the Jetty about a fortnight before had been recovered. When the contractor replied that it had not but tnat a new one hd been substituted, he orderedo i $ 4 thf»t the old one should be recovered ;b^ diirer who was&gt; working et the Jetty, lie bIbo ordered th?it the barge recently sunk ehould sleo be e&amp;lved.

That same night Hia Majeety retur-ned to hw z f nd ordered his train for 7 a.m. the next morning* Leaving here punctually riis Majesty arrived back in Tehran at 10.30 a.ra. on the 13th.

T^-^S^itish Consulate ' yj ; j General 'for Khorasan, Meshed. 6th December, 1938. To His Majesty 1 s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Senipotentiary at the Court of Iran, Tehran.An appreciation of the * Political situation in East Iran 1939 J A travelled American who recently spent several days in Tehran and Meshed on his way to India said that what struck him chiefly about the country was its truly remarkable resemblance to the U.S.S.R*; the same prevailing poverty, the same apathy, the people cowed by the sinister and ubiquitous activities of the secret police; the same pointless and pettifogging regulations unintelligently enforced in such a way as to give the maximum of trouble with the minimum result. As far as Meshed is concerned the picture is by no means overdrawn. Hand in hand with outward improvements goes a steadily decreasing power of resistance to the sinister maisma of state interference from which there is no escape. 2. But although discontent with the present regime is almost universal, tribal chiefs, landowners and mullahs have for several years now been so oppressed that they have to a large extent lost their former influence and in the absence of leaders no overt opposition seems at all probable. The only manifestation of dissatisfaction comes from the few who have had recourse to brigandage for their livelihood. The past year has undoubtedly witnessed a definite lowering of the standards of security on the roads, culminating in October in a particularly daring hold up on the main Meshed-Tehran road some 30 miles only from Meshed, in wnich six or seven brigands closed the road for four hours in the afternoon, held up over a dozen vehicles and decamped with cash believed to amount to 120,000 rials.4 5. In the south on the other hand the central authority has at last taken decisive steps to bring Juma Khan Ismailzai to book. This tribal leader has for years been a thorn in the side of the Mukran administration but hitherto efforts to bring him under control have been confined to attempts to lure him into a trap by false promises or to conciliate him by subsidies and tribal service. But the patience of the authorities seems at last to have been exhausted and in November, on receipt of instructions from Tehran, operations against him were undertaken in earnest. Juma Khan was taken unawares near Shoru but even so put up a strong resistance. After holding out for a week during which time the Ismailzais are reported to have inflicted 60 casualities with the loss of only four of their own men Juma Khan realised that his position was hopeless and slipped through the surrounding cordon with all his family and some 50 tribesmen and escaped across the border near Kacha into British India. The military have seized his flocks and camels and have destroyed his crops. This drastic action, in spite of its failure to achieve its main object, the capture of Juma Khan himself, cannot but enhance the prestige of the central government and will conduce to the pacification of this long disturbed area. 4. But wnile the attention of Mukran is taken up with troubles within, the chief anxiety of Khorasan centres on difficulties without. Refugees from Russia have brought with them more than the mere problem of their own disposal. This, in Khorasan, is not very great as the total number of immigrants via Rajgiran probably does not exceed 2000. But among these refugees were, as was only to be expected, a number of Soviet agents who have given a lively fillip to /the© the spy mania ever present in the province. As a result all Russian refugees, including a number of people who have been living peaceably in Meshed for many years, are now being turned out and sent to the interior of the country, to such places as Shahrud and Sabzewar. On no account are they to be allowed in Tehran. l °• This policy is likely to have unpleasant repercussions on the other foreigners, especially Indians, resident in and around Mesned. The cause of the expulsion the Berberis of Kalata Khush, referred to in paragraph 2 of mj last report w r as almost certainly the discovery by the local authorities of the fact that they were a community of ex-soldiers of the Indian army, two of whom were actually drawing pensions from the British Consulate and therefore, in Iranian eyes, self confessed British spies. A further nine families from Zabul and Zahidan have since been expelled for the same reason. I have been informed on more than one occasion by M. Pakrevan that the Government’s policy is to remove foreigners from all frontier regions and it will not be surprising if in the course of the next few months an attempt is made to extend this policy to other categories of Indians resident in Khorasan, especially to the Kashmiris and Kurramis v/hose numbers run into some hundred 6. But the spy mania, troublesome though it is to its victims, is as nothing compared with the economic regimentation of the national life which is a universal calamity. This however, is nothing new and no special developments have taken place during the past six months, though it may be of interest to record that the use of the 'black bourse' is becoming more general and is beginning apparently to be recognised even by the authorities themselves. British traders /inin Zahidan still seem to think it worth while to hang on in the hope of better days to come; but in Meshed a gradual exodus is beginning, and petty shopkeepers especially, some of whom have lived here all their lives, seem to think that they would be better off out of the country, 7. The new organisation of the provincial administrations which has been law now for over a year is at last beginning to take shape and it appears indeed as if the Ustandars are gradually relinquisning their functions as administrative officers and becoming more the general supervisors which the law apparently intends them to be. But this process is only beginning and though it is too early to say what effect it will eventually have on the general efficiency of the administration it is safe to say that its first effects will only be to increase the prevailing confusion. in Khorasan the Governor General now spends more of his time touring the province. The Farmandar is taking his place as the administrative head of the area, and foreign Consulates have recently been asked to address their correspondence direct to him. In Mukran the new Governor General spends very much more time than his predecessor on tour, though his Headquarters remain at Zahidan. Here the former Military Governor has been reduced to the status of a Bakhshdar and the Vice Consul, who used to correspond purely w r ith him on petty matters, has been specially asked to correspond in future only with the Ustandar, probably because the Bakhshdar is felt to be too junior an officer to be entrusted with Consular work. In Zabul the position is uncertain. The Ustandar, who wasso long himself Governor of Zabul, on his frequent visits seems to give orders direct on any matters in which he is interested without reference to the Farmandar, who in his turn in certain matters seems to write direct to Tehran without consulting the Ustandar. This is perhaps no great matter as no official in East Iran, except possibly M. Pakrevan in Meshed, can in any case take even the smallest action without first referring to Tehran for orders. 8. So far from there being any apparent increase in general efficiency, the roads, which are perhaps the only obvious criterion by which the casual observer can Judge, are definitely deteriorating. in the south the principal cause is said to lie in the fact that less and less of the money provided for their upkeep is actually spent on them. An educated Iranian has indeed expressed the opinion that more than 50% of the country's total budget expenditure finds its way into the pockets of the various officials instead of being devoted to the objects for which it was intended. 9* The Consular boycott, though still strict, is not i now so much in evidence in Meshed partly because with practice the police agents on our gates are making fewer stupid mistakes in the matter of arresting the private servants of Europeans, whether living inside or outside the Consulate, and partly because we are getting so used to it that in the absence of special provocation we are able to ignore it. Iranians now for the most part know that they must get police permission to enter our gates and this they are usually abl. to do in cases of real necessity. Even Mr. Yousef Hakimi mentioned in paragraph 11 of my last report was eventually able to come to claim his £60 deposit. ^hen however /travellerstravellers stay with us on their way through Meshed the watch on our gates is redoubled and includes a cyclist whose furious pedalling after our visitors cars, often empty, on their way to a garage or on some equally harmless errand, affords us some amusement and indeed astonishes our guests. I have pointed out to M. Pakr^van the unfortunate impression which this rather ridiculous boycott must leave on onr fairly numerous visitors - in November alone we had 13 I.C•S• probationers as well as several others - but though he is fully aware of this all he can do is to turn the tables by offering to have them shown over the shrine. (Such visits to the shrine by other nationals are indeed now becoming an everyday occurrence and indicate that a change m our own policy on this subject may well require consideration in the not too distant future). In Zahidan, on the other hand the greater readiness on the part of the Iranians to fraternise has enabled our Vice Consul with the co operation of Colonel Mukri, the Governor General, to stage a football match between a Vice Consulate eleven and an Iranian team, at which the Governor General himself was at home to both Iranian and British officials with no untoward results to the participants. 10. No definite examples of anti-Jewish activities have been noticed but there is an increasing tendency, fostered no doubt by German propaganda, to look on them with suspicion and to speak of them with disrespect. This may however only be a manifestation of the new nationalism which is creating increasing difficulties for all foreigners resident in or visiting the country. The effect of this may be seen in the figures of the pilgrim traffic to Meshedfrom India. In 1934, before the Shrine riots, the figure was 2775. This went down in 1936 to 461, rose in 1937 to 1027 but has fallen again in the present year, for which the total is not expected to be more than 750. 11. It v.ould however be ungenerous to comment on the much that is to be criticised without making any reference to the little that is to be commended. Meshed, with its Shrine is still exceedingly wealthy and the shrine revenues are not wholly expended on the outward signs of progress such as public roads and gardens, though these are much in evidence. More schools are being opened and there can be little doubt that young Iran is both healthier and happier than formerly. The Boy Scouts and Girl Guide movements have come to stay; and there is a general desire for education, the night schools for adults being especially popular. Finally real efforts are being made to improve the hygiene of the city. In particular attention is at last being paid to the interior economy as well as the outside facade of the palatial Shah Reza hospital. The Iranian doctors on the Staff of course have all their national defects; but Meshed is I believe, the only place in Iran where nurses are being trained (by an American supervisor) in a state, as opposed to a mission, hospital and the recent appointment of a European lady (believed to be a relative of Madam Pakrevan and therefore with direct access to the Governor General himself) to supervise the kitchen and domestice arrangements is evidence of a genuine desire to make the hospital a real service to the community instead of the hollow mockery which it has been hitherto.
