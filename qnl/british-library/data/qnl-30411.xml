No reply has so far been received to a telegram sent by Campbell to the Sultan on the subject of paragraph 2 of your letter dated the 10th April 1950. I will send another cable and let you know the result. 3. Am most grateful to you for your efforts to get me back from Salalah,but you know how difficult it is for me to be definite about when I should return. I thimk it may be taken that the Sultan would like me to stay theee for ten days or a fortnight and feel it would be prefer/able not to attempt to make detailed arrangements until I/nad an opportunity of seeing him. I am endeavouring to find out whether there is a Strick boat or one of the Holland Persian Gulf line calling in at Aden and Muscat 6n dates which might suit me. If there is one it would probably be easiest for the R. A. F. to fly me from Salalah to Aden. The best alternative would be for them to fly me to Sharjah,if they would be so kind. 4.

My dear Campbell, Could you Mindly let the Sultan know, with reference to previous intimation, that Wildgoose now expects to roach Salalah in the fi^renoon of the 26 th April and let me know if this will be suitable. Captain SkJ(e ton has enquired whether Salalah is a saluting port, sad if no whether the Sultan will wish salutes to be exchanged on arrival, and also whether ills Highness wi-il wish to exoiiange official calls with the senior liaval Officer. If he does, as the ships arrival on the 2ftlvmay he rather late fbr this purpose, perhaps, after landing Mr. Woods BcULard. and ;ae, eitiier before or after lunch, to suit His Highness • oonvenierce, the Sultan would prefer that Captain 3celton stioold pay his official call next morning at whatever time would be most suitable. 3. Wildgoose vrill leave on the 2^th afternoon and Captain Skelton wishes to see the Kuria .Utriya Islands, Masirah and Sur on the way back, and to visit Muscat from the 6th to 8th May if the Sultan has no objection. I shall be going in Wildgoose, but probably the Sultan will wish Mr. Woods-Ballard to stay longca?, and, in case tills is so, I am already enquiring whether the R.A.F. will be able to fly him either to Mosirah (where he could rejoin Tiil'Jgoose on the 3rd April)or Sharjah (where he can catch a B.I.S.N. steaoer back to Muscat). 4. On return to Idiscat Vfildgoose will fire the usual, salute, followed by the usual exchange of official calls.On the 24th, when she picks up Mr. Woods-Ballard and me, she will not enter the harbour as we shall go out to meet her in the Consulate launch and no formalities will be neoessaiy.

V ould you kindly let re know if you have any thing on record about it ? 2. £y o n view is that H.I f s ships can visit any part of the uscat coast without prior per mission provided no landing is made. They can also visit Khor Kuwai, Khassab and ! ’'uscat and land without prior permission provided that ample prior information is given in the case of -Muscat. At other places the prior permission of the Muscat Government should ordinarily be obtained except perhaps for visits of small parties tc the shore to obtain information, purchase supplies etc. and in particular there should be no shooting or expeditions into the interior without the uscat Government’s per mission.

January 23, 1950. Salutes by Warships /Hy The British Navy^ Persian Gulf orders lay down that His Majesty's Ships should not fire salutes on Fridays. This is out of consideration for the people in the ports they nay be visiting. Recently His Highness the Sultan was good enough to agree to full ceremonial being observed on a Friday in the case of the forthcoming visit of His Majesty's Ship Mauritius to avoid changing the date of arrival already planned. I presume this does not mean that he would not mind it on any occasion, but only in special cirouastanoes. Perhaps you could very kindly enquire and let me know His Highness' views. Possibly it is only the exchange of salutes on arrival that should not take place on a Friday, and there is no reason why salutes in honour of the Sultan, or of officials entitled to a salute, should not be fired by the ship in port. B. Woods-Ball&amp;rd, Esquire, C.I.E., M.B.R., Minister for Foreign Affairs,■MK The Persian Gull lieiidency f Bahrain* 76/2/5P 6th January, 1950 In the Davy's Persian Gull* orders there is a prohibition a&amp;ainst the Tiring of salutes by ships on Fridays. It is perhaps proper that no salute oi a country should be iired on a Friday (this only concerns Muscat at present) and that oificial calls should not be excnan^ea with Palers on i-rlaays, but I see no good reason why the salutes oi’ uovernment officers should not be fired if tney call officially on ships on that day of the week., though an exception might perhaps be made in the case of kuscat where the salutes are fired so close to the town. Would you kindly let me have your views, if necessary after consult ing the Government with whom you are concerned? Major F.C. L.
