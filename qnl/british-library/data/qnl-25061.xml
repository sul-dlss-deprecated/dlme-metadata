On the left of the chart are a triangulation diagram and a short note on survey methodology. The chart also bears the printing statement 'Simla Drawing Office Topo. Dy. No. 117 Exd. C.J.A. August 1911'. The chart was attached to a report (folio 12) on Zora Khor by the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, who concluded that it would not make a suitable harbour for the coastal shipping trade, despite British plans to establish a wireless telegraph station at Zora.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100032168841.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
