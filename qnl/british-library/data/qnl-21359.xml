T. ROUTES IN PERSIA Volume I— Main Routes —1942 INTRODUCTION 1. This Volume has recently been amended and revised largely on the basis of reports received since the entry of British and Russian forces into Iran in August 1941. As a result of this entry and the events which have followed it, it has been necessary to enlarge the scope of the main routes, and these now include all feasible roads from Iraq and the Persian Gulf to the Caucasian frontier and Caspian Sea, and from India to North-east and Central Iran. Many new minor routes have also been added. When studying this Volume, it should be borne in mind that the latest reports on which it is based are dated November 1941, and considerable improvements may since have been effected. 2. Numbering of routes. Main routes (Volume I) have been given Roman numerals as before, and have been re-numbered in an anti-clockwise direc tion, Minor routes (Volume II) are numbered in Arabic multiples of the main routes, e.g. Minor routes branching from, or in vicinity of, Route I ...1 to 19. Minor routes branching from, or in vicinity of, Route V ...50 to 59. Minor routes branching from, or in vicinity of. Route X ...100 to 109 and so on. As far as possible the above principle has been observed, but where there are more than nine minor routes branching from or in the vicinity of a major route, e.g. Route VIII, it has not been possible, and the next adjacent main route number has been utilised, i.e. Route VII. 3. Classification of routes. The following classifications have been observed throughout this Volume :— Capacity Heavy M.T. Two-way traffic A. 1. (not less than 20 '). One-way traffic B. 1. with passings. One-way traffic C. 1. only very narrow. The above classifications are necessarily arbitrary, and routes vary constantly under the influence of new construction, repairs, weather conditions etc., but they are a useful guide to the general capacity of a route. To take — Light M.T. only. Horse Tpt only. A. 2. A. 3. B. 2. C. 2 . 3.3. C. 3.M. T. ROUTES IN PERSIA VOLUME I—MAIN ROUTES M. T.

This is the main route from BAGHDAD to TEHRAN and was used by the British force which entered Persia in August 1941. 2. Surface and Grading .—The road, as originally con structed, was soled to a depth of 4 M and metalled to a depth of 8 ''v Most of this metalling has now worn through and has been replaced by shingle to an average depth of 3'. The road is very well graded and none of the passes present any serious difficulty to fully laden M.T. in any weather. 3. Character of adjacent country—From mile 0 to 13 the country is steeply undulating and though operations off the road on both sides are possible for all arms, the pace of vehicles would be slowed down by the countless steep sided nullahs to be crossed. From mile 13 to 20 operations off the road on either side would be extremely difficult for any vehicles owing to the inten sely broken nature of the country. Thereafter operations off the road are possible for all arms except on the passes where the2 Route I—Section A—contd. surrounding country is very rocky and often precipitous. Such stretches are :— (i) The PAITAK pass from mile 43 to mile 54. (ii) The small pass from mile 92 to mile 94. (iii) The NAL SHIKAN pass from mile 95 to mile 102 . (iv) The CHAHAR ZABAR pass from mile 105 to mile 107. (v) The AIPAL KUSH pass from mile 120 to mile 126. The section is closely commanded on these stretches and commanded, though less effectively, almost throughout its length, such minor exceptions being short stretches of plain at mile 86 and mile 107. Concealment from the air is totally lacking. 4. Climatic effects. —This section can, in the matter of climate, be sharply divided into plain and plateau. The change from one to the other is effected most abruptly by the ascent of the PAITAK pass and it is commonly seen that while KARIND is still in the grip of winter the wheat at SAR-I-PUL is a foot or two in height and when the crops at KARIND are just shewing green the harvest on the plain a few miles away is finished. In the plain (mile 0—47) the heat in summer is very trying and troop movements by day cannot safely be undertaken. In January and February the cold is fairly severe and water often freezes at night. Rain falls (to an annual average of 5') from late Novem ber to early March. On the plateau the summer is mild and troops can march throughout a summers day without distress The winter is severe and the cold by night intense. Rain falls chiefly in November and in April and May. Snow falls mainly in January, February and March but blocking of the passes on this section by snow is rare. 5. Exceptional features. —There are no large rivers and all the streams are adequately bridged. l i though numerous, are not, with the exception of tne PAITAK pass, (1,400 / ascent in 3^ miles) severe. 6. Repair facilities.— Road metal is available throughout. Timber (poplars in groves to a height of 15' and a diameter of 4') QWAUA f t?A^ d n r a ^ QASR-I-SHIRIN, PAITAK, KARIND and orlA tiAbA D. bahour i-s fairly.plentifud-and the Ij^nitnrTroveTrTr ^Def-mik? on maintonnnca—duty The exist.-' 7. Supply facilities. — (i) Camping grounds. —With the exception of the site at SURKHA DIZA (mile 50) all sites are good and there is no lack of other suitable sites. (ii) Water. Plentiful, perennial and good throughout with the exception of mile 0 13, which, though waterless on the road is not far from the HULWAN river.3 Route I—Section A— contd. (iii) Supplies -From mile 0 to 13 the country-side is barren. Thereafter the valleys are fertile while the intervening mountain ranges are, of course, unproductive. As this section crosses the general grain of the country its productivity to a force using the road is much less than it would be to a force moving by minor routes running parallel to the valleys. Supplies, therefore, can be obtained at centres on the road such as QASR-I-SHIRIN, KARIND and SHAHARAD more speedily than they could be collected by systematic search of the country-side. (iv) Fuel—Very scarce from mile 0—40. Thereafter the hill-sides are covered with scrub and thorn. (v) Fodder—Scarce throughout, but the grazing is good in the spring on the plain and during spring and summer on the plateau. (vi) Petrol and oil.-A few tins are usually available at every tea house. Larger stocks (amounts given in the detailed report) are to be found at QASR-I-SHIRIN, KARIND, SHAHABAD and KERMANSHAH. The latter place is now the site of an A.I.O C. refinery with a very large production from which all Northern Iran is fed with bulk supply in tank lorries. (vii) Repair facilities—Poor throughout. Unskilled black smiths to be found at QASR-I-SHIRIN, KARIND and SHAHABAD and semi-skilled mechanics with poor equipment and limited stocks of spare parts for the better known American lorries and cars at KERMANSHAH. The A I.O.C. workshops at KERMANSHAH could effect most heavy repairs. DETAILED REPORT. The distance from KHANIQIN town to the Iraq frontier post at MUNDHIRIYEH is 7 miles. The road has a tarmac surface, is adequately cambered and will carry heavy traffic at all seasons. It rises very gradually throughout and runs in undulating country among hillocks from which it is commanded. Map. 2-F. Miles Classification. Inter, total B. 1 0 0 Iraqi—Iranian frontier.

The road from this point to QASR-I- SHIRIN calls for no detailed comment. It is rough, stony and narrow but the absence of ditches renders partial devia tion for purposes of passing of no difficulty. It is very tortuous and undulating and makes numerous sudden, short and steep descents into and ascents out of narrow, stony and dry nullah beds. It is commanded from a well defined ridge to the north.

Surface and Grading. —The width of the road varies between 18' and 30'. It has a solid foundation throughout but is badly corrugated and has a rough surface. It should stand up to light traffic during the winter, but with the present volume of traffic will soon need repairing. 3. Character of Adjacent Country.—For the most part the road passes up and down valleys with hills on the north and south sides. The surrounding country is mountainous. 4. Climatic Effects.—Mild in summer, severe cold in winter. 5. Exceptional Features. —The road over the SHAH PASS is well drained and should be passable at all times, except in exceptional snow. 6. Alignment. —An earth road runs parallel to the main road in parts. 7. Obstacles—(a) All culverts, bridges and Irish bridges are adequate and in good state of repair. Little obstruction to traffic from flooding should be experienced in wet weather. (b) Demolition of any of the bridges would prove an adequate obstacle in wet weather, but in the dry season, the rivers could be forded with very little difficulty. Road blocks could be sited at the more dangerous bends on ledge roads and would prove good delaying obstacles. 8. Repair Facilities. —Road metal is available all along. 9. Supply Facilities .— (a) Camping sites.—Good. (b) loafer.—Abundant throughout. (c) Supplies. —Plenty KERMANSHAH and HAMA DAN. (d) Fuel. —P. O. L. Refinery at KERMANSHAH.

From AVEH on the road inclines to A. 1. and though corrugated is otherwise in good condition; but maintenance throughout must be increased to cope with continuous heavy M T. traffic (Sept. 1941). 2. Surface and grading—An unsoled track of average width of 20' lightly metalled and heavily shingled. There are no severe gradients. 3. Character of adjacent country— For the most part bleak plateau with a mountainous portion from mile 331 to mile 360. With the exception of parts of this mountainous stretch (such as the AVEH CHAI ravine) operations off the road are possible for all arms on both sides. The road is commanded except as follows:—mile 274 to 276; mile 297 to 301; mile 326 to 365. A special report on the area HAMADAN—SULTAN BULAGH (Map 9 E/Y. 70) will be found at the end of the Section. 4. Climatic effect— Mild in summer owing to its mean elevation of 4,000—5,C00 feet. Intensely cold in winter. Most of the rain falls in November, April and May. The snow falls in December, January, February and early March. 5. Exceptional features. —(i) Rivers — There are no large rivers and the smaller ones such as the QARA CHAI at mile 270 and 282 and the KHAR RUD at mile 352 are adequately bridged and could be forded except in spring or after very heavy and continuous rain. (ii) Passes. —The AVEH pass (it is not locally known as the SULTAN BULAGH pass) at mile 331 is the only pass The ascent is easy as is the descent. Owing to its altitude (7,500') it is, in normal years, blocked with snow two or three times a year for two or three days at a time between late December and early March. 6. Repair facilities. —Road metal is available throughout. Unskilled civil labour is very scarce from HAMAD^N to RAZAN. There is a little timber at RAZAN and AVEH and NAHAVAND for bridge repairs. There are no steam rollers.25 Route I—Section C—contd .. 7. Supply facilities.— (i') Camping ground —Suitable sites are available in great profusion but many of them are rendered useless by lack of water. (ii) Water. —From HAMADAN mile 262 to RAZAN mile 315 in summer no water is seen from a car passing along the road, though former reports give details of water supply in the villages and Sarais off the road. In spring the QARA CHAI (mile 270 and 282) will contain water. This dry stretch would be trying for infantry in summer and the information given in this report should be verified before starting. (iii) Supplies.—Very scarce at stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 though in spring and summer the excellence of the grazing attract laige flocks of sheep and goats. At stages 5 and 8 they are fairly plentiful. Stage 7 was not reconnoitred. At stage 9 (KAZVIN) they are abundant. (iv) Fue/.—Uniformly scarce except at KAZVIN (v) Fodder. —(See supplies.) (vi) Petrol and oil.—A few tins at most tea houses and roadside garages. Very large stocks at KAZVIN. The dumping of supplies en route is now a simple matter since the erection of the refinery at KERMANsHAH. (vii) Repair facilities.—Competent blacksmiths, ill-equipped garages and semi-skilled mechanics and stockists of tyres and spare parts for the common makes of American lorries exist in KAZVIN but nowhere else en route.

Area of grassy downland country bounded on north by lina of villages MANIYAN—HAGAN (D. 7499)—TAIMURCHI (D. 8995) and on the by line of villages RAZAN (D. 6693) —DARYAZIN (D 7089) VASMAQ (D. 7986) and continued in a southeast direction. Sector No. 3. Cultivated area dotted with villages bounded on north by line RAZAN—DARYAZIN—VASMAQ and on the south by QARA CHAI nullah eastwards from road bridge (D. 3756). Sector No. 4. Area of grassy downland country bounded on north by QARA CHAI nullah and on the south by the line Pt. 5613 (D. 3353)—HASAINABAD UD. 3947—GURGUZ (D. 643)- HAJI MAQSUD (D.5446). Sector No. 5. Area of mountains bounded on north by line Pt. 5613— HASAINABAD—GURGUZ—HAJI MAQSUD and on SOUTH by road HAMADAN—MURAD BULAQ (D. 3826). DETAILED REPORT. Sector No. 1. Is a mountainous country south and east of AVEH PASS (Y 7709) up to SULTAN BULAGH, and is difficult and unsuitable for A F. Vs. The track leading Lorn road and track junction (Y. 8109) due east crosses the AQIAH CHAI nullah running parallel to the main road and is impassable here for M.T35 and difficult for A.F.Vs. without approximately one hour’s work on improving the crossing. The nullah runs through a deep valley with steep sides. AVEH PASS contains many nullahs and folds in the ground in which good hull-down and surprise positions could be taken up for the defence of the PASS against enemy A.F.Vs. Sector No. 2. Is grassy downland country and excellent going for A.F.Vs., but due to the nullahs running from north to south is difficult country for M. T. to cross from east to west. The track running south east from MANIYAN through line of village KURTAL (Y. 6905)—AQ CHAQ (Y. 7204) —HAGAN (D. 7599)—MAZRA’EH (D 7798)—KACHLU (8097)—MANUCHEHR (D. 8297)-’AINABAD (D. 8596) is passable for M.T. at a slow rate of progress due to difficult nullah crossings and narrowness of tracks through villages, which necessitates detours being made round them. The track from road and track junction (D. 3655)— QARKHLAR (D. 4255)—YARSALI &lt;D. 4556)—BABUKABAD (D. 5056)—SAMAVAK (D. 5454) follows the kariz line and is equal to a second class road, bye-passing the villages. The second class road and telegraph line marked on the map running southwest from BABUKABAD does not exist. There is, however, a track on the line of the second class road suitable for M. T. at a slow rate of progress. Sector No, 5, The mountainous country is passable by the track mentioned above incorrectly marked on the map as a second class road. The pass is a wide one and there is approximately £ mile on each side (of the track where tanks could manoeuvre). The track leading west through AULIYA (D. 3543)—NAHRAN KHARAB (D. 2942) is rough but passable for M. T. The QARA CHAI nullah is crossable for any vehicle. The track which is incorrectly marked as a second class road becomes difficult to follow in the cultivated areas and villages round HAMADAN, but is passable for M. T. For a distance of 4 miles, where the main road HAMADAN —SULTAN BULAGH crosses the low hills coming down from the northern end of the KUH-I-TUR BUZURG range of mountains, it is overlooked on both sides. There is rolling downland east of the road, suitable for A.F.Vs. to manoeuvre and take up hull-down and surprise positions. Defensive positions covering the main road, and the track marked as second class road from BABUKABAD to HAMADAN where it goes over the Pass mentioned above, could be taken up.36 NOTES. 1. Air-borne and Paratroops.— Could land with great ease at many points in the area recced, particularly the following : (a) Whole of Sector No. 2. (b) Triangular area mentioned in Sector No. 3. (c) Whole of Sector No. 4._ 2. Water Supply .—Plentiful throughout from kariz lines, irrigation ditches, and springs in the mountains. 3. Villages—In nearly every case where tracks pass through villages the way becomes extremely narrow with narrow bridges over irrigation ditches. Great difficulty would be experienced in taking all kinds of vehicles through them, 4. Rainy Season .—From the appearance of the dry nullahs in the area it seems most probable that considerable difficulty would be experienced in crossing the country during the rainy season except by the main road and main tracks.ROUTE I—SECTION D.

Surface and Grading. —From KASVIN to ABIAK the road though corrugated is in good condition. From ABIAK to beyond KEREJ reconstruction is in progress and on practically the whole of this stretch only half the original waterbound road is available, making passing difficult. From four miles beyond KEREI to TABRIZ the road is tarmac (the first portion of the intended tarmac road between TABRIZ and TEHRAN) and the surface is excellent. (Above based on Oct. 1941 report). 3. Character of adjacent country. —A high range of hills runs parallel to the road on the left at distances varying from 4— 40 miles; the Trans-Iranian railway runs closely parallel on the right, where the country is open plain throughout and operations are possible for all arms. Cover from air is uniformly lacking. 4. Climatic effects. —See section C. 5. Exceptional features. —The bridge over the KEREJ river at mile 480—destruction of which would delay a force until repairs had been effected. There is ample timber (unfelled), for this purpose on the spot. 6. Repair facilities. —Road metal is available throughout. Timber (unfelled) is plentiful at KEREJ. Civilian labour is plentiful. Steam rollers are available in TEHRAN. 7. Supply facilities. —(i) Camping ground.—Suitable sites are plentiful. (ii) Water .—Ample at KEREJ and TEHRAN—Sufficient for the numbers given in the Detailed Report at other places.

GENERAL REPORT. 1 Classification.— 1. in all weathers. The road is used by A.l.O.C. petrol tankers and other heavy commercial motors. 2 Surface and Grading .—Generally 18' metalled roadway Two-way traffic, though care is required when passing through villages where road is narrow and winding. The surface is dusty and badly corrugated, especially on the portion HAMADAN- TOKAR (J 3986). Normal maintenance is carried on, but is insufficient as the metalling requires relaying in the worst places. 3 Character of Adjacent Country—The country is des cribed as one long defile varying up to five miles in width with high features on either side from which stretch minor features dividing the ground into a series of long valleys. The country thus lends itself into a series of defensive positions. It is unsuitable for large scale A.F.V. operations and move ment of tracks would be confined to 2-3 miles on either side of the road. Dispersion off the road is possible throughout. A telegraph line follows the route. 4. Villages—The villages generally have orchards varying from 500 to 1000 yards square in size enclosed in mud walls d 5 feet high which would impede track movement oft roads. 5.

Is sufficiently cambered and ditched. Many severe gradients which combined with rough, stony or soft road surface, will prove/ a serious obstacle to fully laden M. T. especially in wet weather. 3. Character of adjacent country. —For the most part bare undulating mountains lying at 6 , 0 ( 0 ' above sea level; inter sected by deep and narrow valleys. Mountains stretch from mile 1 to 12. It is seldom that the road is not commanded from the flank. With the exception of the mountainous patches the country off the road is almost ideal for cavalry operations, but A. F.

Surface and Grad ng. —Apart from some bad patches the road gen irally is reasonably good and presents no difficulties for modern M T. It is used regularly by A.I.O C. tank lorries and other heavy vehicles. One probable source of trouble is the weakness in construc tion of the numerous small culverts over irrigation channels. The majority are of wood and many have subsided in the centre to such an extent as to cause damage, if not seen beforehand and crossed with great care. 3.

On the whole a good road; but in the plain, where it has been raised, liable to be washed away by cloud bursts, e g., (Aug. 1939). 3. Alignment and Character of Adjacent Country. —For the first 25 miles the road crosses the URMIEH Plain, with the Trans-Caucasian railway running approximately parallel to the left. It then enters hillv country comes into the open again for a short space at MARAND, re-enters the hills, and finally drops to the ARAS River and JULFA. In the hillv portions the road is constantly crossing and re-crossing the railway, and there are many more crossings than are shown on the map. 4.

Surface and gradin '*.—From KHORRAMSHAH (MU HAMMERAH) to the BAHMASHIR ferry two miles north of ABADAN there is a graded and water bound earth road with a shell dressed oiled surface. It is unlikely that this road would stand up successfully to continuous heavy M. T. in wet weather. From that point to AHWAZ. a distance of 74 miles—the rocid is merely &amp; track across a flat plain of alluvial clay which a few hours rain turns into a quagmire. Periodic floods occur every three or four years and the entire country south of AHWAZ is inundated. In view, however, of the KARUN river and the Trans- Laman railway, the route is only a secondary means of communi cation. 3 Character of adjacent country-Throughout this section the road is on an open plain. 4. Climatic effects. The heat in summer is intense—maxi mum shade temperatures of 120° common. In winter it is cold but does not freeze. The rainy season is from December to April. 5. Exceptional features.—Ni\.81 Route III—Section A— contd. 6. Repair facilities. —Stone for road metal could be quarried near AHWAZ. There are 10 road rollers in ABADAN. 2 are steam driven and 2 are light and unsuitable for road work. The remaining 6 (2 of 8 tons and 4 of 12 tons) have i. c. engine. Very little in the way of maintenance work is done, as this section is regarded by the company merely as a fair weather and secondary line of communication. 7. Supply facilities. —(i) Camping grounds are numerous. (ii) Water is abundant as the KARUN river is, except from about mile 48 to mile 69, never more than a mile or two distant from the road. (iii) Supplies are plentiful at MUHAMMERAH, ABADAN and AHWAZ, very scarce elsewhere. (iv) Fodder and fuel other than oil fuel are scarce, (v) Grazing is good for 2 months in the spring. (vi) Petrol and oil are available in unlimited quantities at MUHAMMERAH, ABADAN and AHWAZ. (vii) Repair facilities exist at these towns ; the Company’s M T. workshops at ABADAN particularly being able to take on any M. T. engineering job to all grades of vehicles ranging from light cars to heavy lorries and tractors. In addition the ABADAN main workshop, comprising boiler shop, machine shop, carpenter shop, foundry, etc., can undertake repair work within certain limits. DETAILED REPORT. Map 10-B. Miles.

Five routes exist between AHWAZ and DIZFUL, all of which present difficulties to M. T. and were, in the summer of 1941, in a bad state of repair. All five routes, in the earlier stages at any rate, are impassable for some time after rain. The routes are as follows :— (1) AHWAZ (left bank)—WAIS—MULLASANI—HADDAM —DAR-I-KHAZINEH (left bank)—DAR-I-KHAZINEH (right bank)-SHUSTAR—DIZFUL. This route, which is probably the best of the five, follows Route III-B to DAR-I-KHAZINEH and then strikes north to SHUSTAR. Distance about 115 miles. The following obstacles are met. (a) Ferry at DAR-I-KHAZINEH. Consists of one iron raft, deck space 16' by 10', safe load 10 tons, turn round about 17 minutes. Owned and operated by A. I. O. C. by means of steel wire cable and wind lass. One barge as stand by. Approaches down sloping sandy banks. Width of river 150 feet.100 (b) Ferry over KARUN river at SHUSTAR. Consists of 3 heliums decked over and capable of taking two 3-ton lorries. (2) AHWAZ (left bank)—WAIS- BAND-I-QIR—DAR-I-KHA- ZINEH— SHUSTAR—DIZFUL. This route follows Route III B to MULLASANI, whence it takes a more direct route to DAR-I-KHAZINEH and so to SHUSTAR. Distance about 105 miles. Obstacles. (a) Ferry over AB-I-GARGAR at BAND-I-QIR. Con sists of one raft, deck space 20' by 10', capacity 2 tons dead weight. Actuated by hand winch. One vehicle at a time, which runs on and off ramps. Turn-round about 10 minutes Ferry approached by cuttings in high and steep river banks. Width of river 175 feet. (b) Ferry over KARUN river at SHUSTAR, as in (1) (b) (3) AHWAZ (left bank)-BAND-I-QIR-SHAIKH HUSAIN —SHUSTAR—DIZFUL. This route follows Route (2) above to 13 miles north of BAND-I-QIR, then takes a more direct road to SHUSTAR. Distance about 97 miles. The last portion of the road from SHAIKH HUSAIN to SHUSTAR, is very bad. Obstacles as in (2) above. (4) AHWAZ (right bank)—SHUSH—DIZFUL. This track marked on I' map as motorable in dry weather r^tothe west of the railway, between rivers KARKHE and Ao-i-DIZ. Distance roughly 100 miles Believed to contain no major obstacles but to be in a very bad state of repair. The railway construction track is also believed to be passable for (5) ROAD —AHWAZ—ANDIMISHK. A road now exists (January 1942 ) which follows the rail aI1 .the way.

Narrow winding road through town. One way traffic only. Traffic policing essential as block might cause many hours delay Town lies on both sides of AB-I-GARGAR river, bridged in middle of town by old masonry railway bridge of great strength.

B. 2 1 79 Ferry—Consists of 3 large heliums decked over; deck overlaps two outside bellums by about 2 ft. One vehicle only can be taken at a time; turn round about 10 minutes. Ferry operated by an old motor boat. There are two other rafts at the site, one for animals and one as stand by. Condition of ferries not good, but will take Class V loads if handled carefully. Width of crossing about 200 yards ; maxi mum depth of water 12 ft. During flood periods level is said to be above that of shingle on south bank. North bank consists of sandstone bank 20 ft. high, through which cutting has been made for approach to ferry. Note —From SHUSTAP to DIZFUL the road is des cribed (Sept. 1941) as being well defined and well surfaced, having a hard bottom covered with . pebbles, plenty of which are available along the route for repair. The larger nullahs crossed, of which their are many, are likely to be impassable for some days at a time in wet weather- There are no obstacles of any significance and no cover from air, but dispersion is possible at all but a very few places along the route.

Distance .—178 miles. Reference Sheets.-9-D, 2-P, 2-0, 9-C. GENERAL REPORT. 1. Classification .—Generally B 1. It will accommodate two way traffic except in the occasional narrow stretches which are noted in the detailed report. For large convoys a system of up and down timings would be advantageous. The Amnieh telephone line would make this easy to control as it follows the road. 2. Surface and Grading.—Heavy lorries run on this section in all seasons but a considerable amount of work would have to be done on the road before it was fit for continuous heavy M. T. The soling on this section is deficient. Between DIZFUL and PUL-I DUKHTAR a distance of 96 miles—the lack of soling is noticeable in very wet weather as this portion consists of a flat plain, and red clay and gypsum hills. The remaining poftion is in many places blasted out of solid rock and has a much harder surface. The metalling is generally adequate though loose shingle is used excessively. While there are numerous sharp hairpin bends on steep gradients and one long pass necessitating great care and the employment of low gears, there are no obstacles to the progress of fully laden M. T. 3. Character of Adjacent Country ,—From mile 1-15 the road crosses an open plain. From mile 16-95 the country is mountainous though the road is not commanded throughout its- length as it often follows wide vallevs. brom mile 9o-150 the road f ? ? WS L a j ? and narrow g° r ge and is commanded effectively by the high and almost precipitious sides. For the last 20 miles the country is open. 4. Cli nat c Effects, (i) Snow.—This section is seldom affec- ted by snow as it attains no great altitude. (ii) Rain and spates-December and March are the two months m which ram falls In a normal year the road will not be affected, but in 1934 after a week s intermittent rain the road was closed for two or three days by spates and rivers in flood For the first 40 or 50 miles after leaving DIZFUL high r p r ature / I are u me?t Wlt}a - In summer 125° is not uncommon. As the road climbs on to the plateau the drop in temperature is KHVRRAMABAdIs reached. ^ C ° ld n0t intei&gt;Se tiU109 Route IV—Section-B.— contd. 5. Exceptional Features—(i) Rivers—The BALA RUD (mile 15) and ZAL (mile 46) are the only two rivers of import ance in this section. (ii) Passes. —The GARDAN-I-CHUL (mile 85) is the only pass to be met with in this section. Its ascent is tortuous and steep but its descent straight and gradual. (iii) Bridges.—The two bridges over the two rivers men tioned in 5 (i) are the most important that over the ZAL being specially so. Destruction of this bridge would cause con siderable delay. (iv) Fords. —There are numerous fords After rain, special care is necessary as even 1| feet of water may hide boulders of considerable size. These are washed down by previous spates and are the cause of many broken crank cases. (v) Tunnels. —There is only one tunnel on this section— at mile 133; a vital point. Destruction of this would entail a long delay. 6. Repair Facilities — Stone is available throughout this section by the road side. The whole section is sparcely populat ed. One steam roller is available at SALE 'TAB AD and one at KHURRAMABAD. It is estimated that the Iranian Govern ment employs a man a mile on maintenance work. 7. Supply Facilities. — (i) Camping grounds. —Plentiful. (ii) Water. —Plentiful throughout. (iii) Supplies. —Can be obtained in DIZFUL. The Chief of Police is the best person with whom to arrange this. From mile 1-15 and from mih 95 176 the country is fertile but produces no surplus to its own needs. From mile 15-95 the country is an uninhabited, and apparently uninhabitable, tangle of moun tains. (iv) Fuel--Very scarce throughout—a little brushwood and scrub is available. (v) Fodder—Very scarce. While the development of motor transport has caused a great decrease in animal transport on all Persian roads this decrease is nowhere more noticeable than on this route. What little animal transport still plies is for tribal needs and keeps to the mountain tracks. Fodder is, therefore, almost unobtainable till KHURRAMABAD is reached, (vi) Grazing —Poor, (vii) Petrol and oil. —DlZFUL—about 20,000 gallons of petrol and 1,000 gallons of oil. ANDIMLSHK.—Large stocks held at the A.I.O.C. Depot. KHURRAMABAD.—About 45,000 gallons of petrol and 2,000 gallons of oil. Odd tins are available at the road side tea-shops.110 Route IV—Section B.— contd. (viii) M.T. Repair facilities.— Garages with blacksmiths exist at DIZBUL, SALEHABAD and KHURRAMABAD. Neither skilled workmen nor up-to-date workshops exist on this section. 2?ote.~lt was reported in January 1942 that KAMPSAX in their work on the ANDIMISHK—TEHRAN read continued widening operations r&lt;gardles=, of surface. The result is that where the original surface is red clay, the road becomes dangerously slippery after even light rainfall. Seiious blockages frequently occur —either from skidded vehicles or from those that cannot climb the gradi ents owing to bad surfaces. DETAILED REPORT. Leave DIZBUL by the only bridge over the AE-I-DIZ. This bridge, made of stone, is 35G X long and has 22 pointed arches, which are about 40 feet above the water level. The centre portion which has, at some time, been washed away, is in the form of a suspension fridge. This portion is only 6 feet broad.

The road is used by A.I O.C. petrol tankers and other heavy commercial motors. 2. Surface and grad:ng .—Generally 18' metalled roadway. Two way traffic though care is required when passing through villages where road is narrow and winding. The surface is dusty and badly corrugated, especially on the portion HAMADAN- JOKAR (J. 3986). Normal maintenance is carried on, but is insufficient as the metalling requires relaying in the worst places. 3. Character of adjacent country—The country is described as one long defile varying up to five miles in width with high features on either side, from which stretch minor features dividing the ground into a series of long valleys. The country thus lends itself into a series of defensive positions. It is unsuitable for large scale A. F. V. operations and movements of tracks would be confined 2-3 miles on either side of the road. Disoersion off the road is possible throughout A telegraph line follows the route. . 4- Clvnat c effects. This section is not affected much by ■rain as the country is well drained and there are no rivers which might come down in spate and wash away the road. Snow between November and March is a frequent cause of interruption of traffic.

GENERAL REPORT. 1. Classification—B. 1 inclining to A. 1. The road is used by A. I. O. C. petrol tankers and other heavy commercial motors. 2. Surface and grading.-Generally 18' metalled road way. Two-way traffic, though care is required when passing through villages where road is narrow. Surface for the most part is dusty and badly corrugated Normal maintenance is carried on, but is insufficient as the metalling requires relaying in the worst portions. The sector 15 miles in length east of IRAQ, where the road crosses a sandy desert, is liable to become flooded after rain and to merge into the TUZLU GOL salt lake t£&gt; the north. 3. Character of Adjacent Country—The country is less mountainous than in sections B, C or D, it consists chiefly of dreary uninhabited barren plateaus and plains exposed m the winter to blizzards and in summer to the sun a very trying terrain for infantry at all seasons. The country is unsuitable for large scale A F. V. operations, except in the Salt Lake area in dry weather and between Miles 380 and 405 and movement off tracks is confined to a limited distance on either side of the road. Much of it is devoid of water, supplies and inhabitants. 4. Climatic effects—Snow falls heavily and is liable to drift on the two high and exposed plateaus between MALAYIR and IRAQ and between IRAQ and QUM. The read is unfenced and unwalled and after snow the track is ob iterated and vehicles frequently get bogged in the soft patches at the side of the road. Rain will render the 15 mile stretch east of IRAQ water logged and vehicles approaching the sides of the road will get stuck up to the axles in the glutinous clay. The winter is bitterly cold and in the summer at mid-day the heat excessive between IRAQ and QUM. 5 Road Alignment—The map is accurate except for the last 15 miles to IRAQ. The railway line passes to the west and not 'to the east of the group of hills in Square K 14, and comes close to the road li miles before reaching the village °t NAMAK KHUR (K. 1149). For the remainder of the section to IRAQ, road railway and hill contours are not accurate.138 Route IV—Section E— contd. 6 . Obstacles. —Are practically non-existent. Several large bridges in good condition exist, but their demolition would impose only limited delay. The bridge at K. C846 has collapsed (Sept. 1941) but there is a diversion. The gorge at TULEH (J. 9045) is a possible defensive area. 7. Repair Facilities. —Road metal is available throughout this section with the exception of the 15 mile plain east of IRAQ. This section is sparsely populated but the Persian Govern ment employs a man a mile on maintenance. No steam rollers were observed in this section. 8 . Supply Facilities. —(i) Camping grounds. —Are adequate. (ii) Water. —Is not abundant in this section—the drier areas being those mid-way between MALAYIR and IRAQ and IRAQ and QUM. (iii) Supplies. —Are very plentiful in IRAQ and QUM— very scarce elsewhere. (iv) Fuel—See (iii). (v) Fodder —See (iii). (vi) Grazing. Is good as far as IRAQ—poor beyond. (vii) Petrol andcil .—Large stocks are held in IRAQ and QUM elsewhere a few tins can usually be obtained from the roadside tea shops.

At present 10-ton lorries are using this road and experiencing no difficulty, but after heavy rain the first 43 miles would probably be impassable, and in the remaining mountainous portion of the section there are no less than five passes where passing is difficult and traffic control would be necessary in the case of convoys. These portions are classified as C. 1. in the detailed report. 2. Surface and grading—At one time there was no soling and very little metalling on this section, and for the most part shin gling was to an average width of 8' only. But in view of its present importance (January 1942) as a supplementary route for supplies to Russia much work is being carried out and several thousand labourers are employed in improvement and upkeep. The gradients between Mile 58 and 170 are severe, with many sharp corners. 3. Character of adjacent country —Vlat plain from miles 0 to 43 rolling foot hills from mile 43 to 58, intensely mountainous mile 58 to 136 and mountainous for the remainder. Except for occasional short stretches of plain, plateau or wide valley between mile 58 and 136 operations off the road are impossible for any arm but infantry and not infrequently impossible for infantry too owing to the precipitous nature of the hill-sides. The road is closlelv cbmmanded from mile 58 to the end.157 Route V—Section A— contd. 4. Climatic effects—Thom mile 0 to 90 the heat during June, July and August is intense and troop movements would have to be made by night. From December to February for the remainder of this section though hot in summer troops can operate by day. In winter the cold after KAZERUN is severe. The best season for operations is from 15th March to 15th May and October and November. Rain falls in November, December, January, February and March but only to a total of about 6' a year, and on ’ an average about five days in each of the above months. At SHIRAZ the mean monthly minimum in winter is sometimes a few degrees below freezing. 5. Exceptional features.— (i) The MASHILEH in wet weather. (ii) The FILF1LAN pass at mile 58. (iii) The MALU pass at mile 66. (iv) The KAMARIJ pass at mile 84. (v) The TURKMAN pass at mile 90. % (vi) The DUKHTAR pass at mile 116. (vii) The PIR-I-ZAN pass at mile 126. The steepness, narrowness, twistiness, roughness and, in ome cases, the length of the ascent and in all the precipitous tature of the hill-sides on these six passes combine to make this &gt;ortion of road as dangerous as any to be found m the world. These passes should only be negotiated at night by M. T. ising headlights. The passes present good target for air bombing .nd suitable opportunities for sabotage. 6 Repair facilities—Metal is non-existent up to mile 44 .nd plentiful thereafter. Labour is .plentiful. There are no steam •oilers nor could they be employed in the hilly stretch. 7. Supply facilities. L29 the sites are good. (ii) Water. —With the exception of AHMADI, KUNAR FAKHTEH, and KAMARIJ, water is good and , ' uffl ^ ent ^g ^ brigade and its transport at ail seasons. During the rainy season :he above places also ^ve sufficient, but in the hot weat^ supply becomes practically ml, without special means of extract ng it. At all stages the supply of. water gradually decreases luring the summer and autumn, till rain begins to fall in Novem ber/from which time it increases again, being at its greatest about April. -(i) Camping grounds. Except at mile* 158 Route V—Section A.— contd. At and near BUSHIRE the water is rather brackish and new-comers become seriously affected by drinking it. Tube pumps are recommended for the stages where the supply is not from streams and by this means sufficient water for a brigade could always be obtained ; also leather buckets and ropes are useful for drawing water from wells. (iii) Supplies. —With some difficulty, supplies sufficient for a battalion of Indian Infantry, with transport, would be procurable all along the route at any time of year. Large quantities of barley are to be obtained in KAZERUN after the harvest in June ; also good supplies of rice, grain, vegetables and fruit. Live-stock is found only in limited quantities as far as KAZERUN; but at KAZERUN and onwards, with the exception of MIAN KUNTAL, there would be sufficient for a brigade at least. SHIRAZ has ample supplies of all kinds in their season, and could support a division. For a month’s supplies at BUSHIRE for one brigade, at least a month’s notice should be given to the British Consul- General, BUSHIRE. (iv) Fuel. —Fuel is the greatest difficulty along the road, and is almost unobtainable in the first three stages. Further on a certain amount is procurable, mostly in the form of tamarisk bushes in the lower country, and dwarf oak in the hills. This latter is very plentiful between KAZERUN and DASHT-I- ARJAN. Transport should be provided for carrying at least one day’s supply, with a force. (v) Grazing—The grazing along the route is very scanty, many places having none whatever for horse, mule or camel Bhoosa (chopped straw) is the only fodder available, and sufficient for 1,000 animals could be collected in the vicinity of all stages Camel grazing is reported to be nil. (vi) Petrol and oil—Large stocks at BUSHIRE and SHIRAZ. Plentiful at KAZERUN—a few tins at most roadside tea houses. (vii) Repair facilities—Good at BUSHIRE and SHIRAZ where stockists of spare parts for American lorries and semi skilled blacksmiths and garages exist. Nil elsewhere. Petrol pumps have now been installed at BUSHIRF BORASTAN (Mile 43). KAZERUN (Mile 104£), and SHIRAZ (two). 8. Tactical. —From November to April BUSHIRE is very easily defended.

Surface and grading. —The road is not soled but it is either lightly metalled or heavily shingled except in places where it crosses solid rock and where no surfacing is necessary. It is maintained in good condition and light cars can travel over it at a high average speed. There are a few steep gradients and bad corners in the first 100 miles all noted in the detailed report. 3. Character of adjacent country. —For the greater part tpyi- cal Iranian plateau. For many miles especially between SURMAQ and SH AHR RIZA the ground bordering the road is so open that a division could move in line. Throughout the entire length of this section infantry and cavalry can operate off the road The stretches where operations off the road for A. F.

Reference sheets. —9-P., 9-0., 9-K., 9-J. GENERAL REPORT 1. Classification. —A-l, to DILIJAN ; B. 1 from DILIJAN to QUM. 2. Surface and grading .—A good metalled road. Fast speeds can be maintained to DILIJAN. The road is very straight and monotonous and there are no gradients to speak of. Beyond DILIJAN the road deteriorates; there are many irrigation channels and small shallow nullahs and care must be exercised. 3. Character of adjacent country .—Mostly bleak plateau or desert with some hilly but not mountainous country for the last 90 miles. All arms can operate off the road throughout. Concealment from the air is totally lacking. 4. Climatic effects .—This road is little affected by either rain or snow and traffic is seldom held up. The snow falls chiefly in December-February and the rain in March April, with frequent thunderstorms as the summer approaches in May and June. The cold in winter is intense and the heat in summer not so severe as to hamper troop movements by day. 5. Exceptional features.—The river crossing at mile 603 after heavy rain. The bridge at mile 667f. 6. Repair facilities—Meted available throughout. Timber nil. Labour scarce. 7. Supply facilities. This section is singularly poor in supplies and water. Being a comparatively new road it has been aligned with an eye to distance and terrain for the benefit of mechanical transport and it is not used by those few caravans which are still to be found in these parts of Iran. Much of the area is bleak plateau or waterless desert and elaborate arrange ments must be made for dumping the supplies required. DETAILED REPORT. Miles. Classification. Inter. Total.

A route of growing importance between IRAQ (SULTANABAD) and ISFAHAN with a saving in distance of 50 miles over the route via QUM Routes IV (E) and V (C). An even more direct route via KHUMAIN, GULPAIGAN and KHUNSAR (Route 212) while effecting a saving of 25 miles over Route V-D is not at present practicable for M. T. heavier than 1^ tons, and that only in summer. 2. Surface and grading .—A smoothed track of average width of 10'over hard ground. It is lightly shingled. There are no gradients which would prove a serious obstacle to fully laden M. T. (up to 3 ton lorries) except in exceptionally bad weather on the ascent of the KUCH pass at mile 70. In S. ptember 1941 the surface of the road was reported t ) be verv rough and in need of repairs, which were due to be started in October 1941. 3. Character of adjacent country .—Open rolling moorland, permitting operations off the road on both sides for all arms throughout. Cover from air is obtainable in many well-treed villages close to the road. The country traversed in this section is much more fertile than in Section (C). 4. Climatic effects. —Cool in summer, very cold in winter Rainfalls chiefly in November and from March till May. Snow falls from December to early March. It does not lie deeply except on the KUCH pass where labour from the two villages of VARCHIN and GILLI, situated about equidistant from the summit on either side, is procurable. 5.

Classification. —B. 1. in all weathers with the exception of the portion at mile 93 in the TANG-I-ZAGH which is C. 1. and other short stretches of narrow road mentioned in the detailed report. A. I. O. C. lorries use the road. 2. Surface and Grading. —The road is adequately soled and was described in Sept. 1941 as an excellent all-weather road. 3. Character of Adjacent Country.—For the first 187 miles the country is almost all mountainous and the road commanded from the hills on either side. From miles 187 to SIRJAN (SAIDA BAD) a vast open plain is crossed, where operations off the road are possible for all arms. 4. Climatic effects. The heat in summer for the first half of this stage is very trying. Near the coast the humidity is very great and when the coast is left behind and the road enters the narrow stony valleys, the scorching effect of the sun renders all movement of troops by day in summer a hazardous undertaking. In winter the cold on the SIRJAN (SAIDABAD) plain is severe. The annual rainfall is very small and this section is sel- dom put out of action by rain or snow. In the spring and early summer spates of short duration ollowing thunderstorms are not uncommon. 5. Exceptional features-Th^ TANG-I-ZAGH pass (mile 93£) consisting of a mile and a half of extremely dangerous road A narrow road has been cut out of the cliff. On the outer side'213 Route VI—Section A— contd. which has no parapet, there is a sheer drop of 200-400 feet to the river bed. 3 ton lorries cannot negotiate this pass without unload ing owing to the overhang of the cliff. No larger lorry than a 3 ton can pass even unloaded owing to the small radius of the corners. 6. Repair facilities .—Road metal is available throughout this section. The area is very scarcely populated and the Govern ment probably employs a man per 3 miles on maintenance duty. Steam rollers are not available. 7. Supply facilities —Suitable sites for camping grounds are plentiful but, as is usually the case in Central and East Persia, the real problem is water and the great shortage of this throughout the entire section seriously limits the number of suit able camping grounds. Supplies, fuel, fodder and grazing are all extremely scarce and no supply centres exist between BANDAR ABBAS and SIRJAN. Petrol is only obtainable at these points. Repair facilities are completely lacking. DETAILED REPORT. Map 25-A. Miles. Classification, Inter. Total. B. 1 B. 1 B. 1 B. 1 B. 1 B. 1 B. 1 B. 1 B. 1 0 0 British Consulate.

Character of Adjacent Country—In this section the road traverses some of the most inhospitable and barren country in the whole of Persia or possibly the whole of Asia Most of it is desert except when for the last 15 miles into YEZD, it consists of gently undulating gravel plateau and is not commanded at any point. Operations off the road are possible for all arms through out the section. Concealment from the air is totally lacking. 4. Climatic effects. The average annual rainfall is very small After exceptionally heavy thunderstorms (which usually occur in the spring and early summer) spates may be encountered but seldom impede traffic for more than a few hours. Snow does not block this road. The heat in summer at mid-day is intolerable and in winter the clod is severe. In either seasons the utter lack of cover, vegetation and habitation renders this route a very trying one for infantry to use. Its passage by M T. on the other hand, which can traverse quickly the waterless stretches and pass in a day’s run from town to town, presents no insurmountable difficulty. *5. Exceptional Features. —Nil. 6. Repair Facilities.—Gravel is available throughout. No steam rollers exist. Traffic is so infrequent that the Persian Government, it is estimated, employs, at the most a man per 5 miles on maintenance duties. 7. Suoply facilities. —(i) Camping ground. —Suitable sites are unlimited. (ii) Water. —As always in East and Central Persia, this is the crux of the problem. The present road has been aligned with a view to (a) directness and (b) freedom from inundation. It keeps to the high ground and water is scarce and brackish. The old caravan route (Routes in Persia Volume III, No. 20) lying from 5-15 miles to the north is better supplied though the water there too is mostly brackish. (iii) Supplies.-KERMAN, RAFSINJAN (RAHRAM- ABAD) and YEZD are the only towns w ence suppl es can be obtained in large quantities. At no other place could supplies for more than half a battalion for a day be reckoned on. j Fuel, fodder and grazing are practically unobtain- (vi) i abl - (vii) Petrol and oil—Are obtainable in large quantities at KERMAN and YEZD, in small quantities at RAFSINJAN and unobtainable elsewhere. (viii) Repair facilities —Garages, blacksmiths, and the vendors of those spare parts most commonly in demand for American lorries and cars, exist in KERMAN and YEZD but at no other p.ace. r234 Route VII—Section A—contd. DETAILED REPORT. KERMAN.—A healthy town (though tape-worm is pre- va ent), due to its sandy soil, the altitude of 5,500 , and its dryness. 50,000 inhabitants. H « d 0 u y ter * of _9? ve i'? ra n General and a mixed independent brigade. P.O. T.U., iel. U. A good Mission Hospi al (see under Section E). Camping ground—The old camp site of the S.P.R. opposite the Consulate is a suitable one and being under the hills affords slight protection against air attack. Any ins alia cions, such as Supply Depot, would have to be pitched in the open, but KERMAN is a suitable stage for refilling with supplies and overhauling vehicles of a force moving into the country from ZAHIDAN. Supplies .—Could either be brought across by road from ZAHIDAN or up from BANDAR ABBAS by road, having been landed there by sea. This latter route is used by the AJ.O.C. for supplying petrol to KERMAN and the east and S. E. Goats, sheep and cattle for 1,000 men can be obtained locally also vegetables in limited quantities from May to November. Petro/.—Storage for 100,000 tins ; present stocks (November 1041), about 10,000 tins. KERMAN is a distributing depot, hence stocks fluctuate. Local M. 7.—Scarce. There are about 56 lorries registered at KERMAN (November 1941). but 90 per cent, are working outside the area, particularly on the MESHED road. Of those remaining the A.I.O.C has them under contract for moving petrol from BANDAR ABBAS to KERMAN and ZAHIDAN. Local labour—Up to 2,000 coolies could be collected from KERMAN and neighbouring villages. Poud 5 .—In addition to the main roads entering and leaving the town, a grant was approved in 1939 for the construction of a new road between KERMAN and JIRUFT. JIRUFT is not traceable on the map and it is not known what progress has been made in the road, but if and when completed it should open up the JIRUFT area and be of strategic as well as administrative value. Motorable roads linking KERMAN with neighbouring villages were also begun in 1939. Map 24-F. Miles. Cla-sification. Inter. Total A. 1 0 0 KERMAN—main square.

Authority. —“Plumrec” Report November 1941 Notes.— (1) This route has been numbered VII-D, and BAM to KERMAN Route VII-E, in order not to interfere with the continuity of the KERMAN-ISHAHAN Route and its link via Route VI with BANDAR ABBA^. Put the importance of the ZAHII'AN- KERMAN Route is such as to justify its becoming a major route in spite of its imperfections. It provides an additional road link between India and N. W. Iran, and might be extremely valuable. (2) For further details see the report compiled by 'Plumrec” in November 1941 (copies available at G. H. Q. India). GENERAL REPORT. 1. Classification .—B 2. But for the obstacles mentioned in para. 2 it would be fit for heavy M. T. and could be made so reasonably quickly. 2. Surface and Grading .— (a) As far as NASRATABAD SIPI (24 O/E. 417*) the ' road is similar to the shingle roads of Baluchistan and runs through much the same country of flat plain, rolling down or over occasional ranges of hills. There are no excessive gradients or weak bridges, and the surface is fair for this type of road. The road is generally wide and can take two-way traffic easily. The dust is very bad and will restrict traffic to about 6 v.t.m., if the wind is unfavourable. (b) The section NASRATABAD SIPI-BAM starts off over the DARWAZA NADARI, a very narrow pass only wide enough for one-way traffic, with a steep ascent and descent at the summit From KAHURAK (24 O/E. 1724) the road follows no particular track for about 20m. over sandv plain and then, at the edge of the LUT desert, runs into about 2£ m. of very heavy sand that can only be crossed by the use of sand mats etc., and with much manual labour on those vehicles which get stuck. (c) From this bad patch there is a run of 14 m. to the tower of MIL-I-NADARI (24 O/J. 7479)—a land mark for caravans about 55' high-over soft but shallow sand that requires careful driving,256 Route VII—Section D— contcl. (d) From the tower there is another 4m. stretch of loose sand that requires sand equipment. A large number of vehicles would soon cut up the whole area and increase the difficulties. (e) After crossing the second bad stretch of sand the road runs through broken country by a narrow track ex cessively dusty and badly in need of repair as far as BAM. 3. Climate. —During the months November to March it is intensely cold at night and rain may cause temporary spates. In summer the heat is so great as to hinder movement by day and there is no shade for troops lying up; it is also liable to cause tyre trouble. Local transport only moves by night during summer, except across the sand which it does at dawn or dusk. Severe sand storms are encountered in the LUT which s eriously hinder visibility and cause over-heating of engines; t hey may last a week. 4. Obstacles. —The only serious obstacles are the two patches of soft deep sand mentioned in para. 2, between miles 134-136£ and 152-156. These stretches can at present be crossed only with much difficulty by small numbers of vehicles at a time. If only a temporary route is required, a suitable crossing could be made by using Army Track netting fixed over planking ; Army Track would be difficult to anchor in the soft sand. If a permanent route is required, a pukka road should be constructed, either of soling and metalling or of sleepers. Local material is non-existent; the nearest stone on the route is from the hills about mile 84, or from BAM. 5. Alternative Routes. —There are two possible— • (a) ZAHIDAN north along the MESHED road turning west through TABAS direct to YEZD. This involves a very wide detour. (b) MIRJAWA (S. E of ZAHIDAN) south to KWASH* thence to BAM. This is reported to be free of sand’ but it has not been used for some years, and no reliable information on it is available. 6. Improvements and Maintenance. (a) Work required to bring the route up to the standard for regular traffic to the following specification :— To be fit for occasional convoys of 50 to 100 loaded 5-ton lorries in all weathers. Ruling gradient 1/20. Width minimum of 16' between drains with passing places at least every mile.257 Route VII—Section D— contd. Shingle or small grade metal up to 3' minimum width 10 '. Soling as required only where necessary. ZAHIDAN to BAM, 210 miles. Mile 1-5 Already being repaired as part of the road ZAHIDAN to MESHED. „ 5-80 Requires general repair and more shingling throughout. ,, 80-106 Requires widening and general repair and shingling. This portion is only a rough track over rather broken ground. ,, 106 Nullah crossing requires a causeway, 120 yards. ,, 106-134 This portion is open desert with no road but vehicles can drive anywhere without much difficulty. There is a track which heavy iorries use which is harder than the remainder. This is very corrugated and could be repaired. ,, 134-136^ Soft sand. A complete road is required over this stretch. „ 136^-152 As for 106-134. 152-156 As for 134-136^ „ 170-210 The road here except for two short patches is no more than a dusty track over sandy countiy covered with scrub. It requires widening, levelling and sl ingling. It also crosses ten irrigation channels which should be piped under the road. (b) The present scale of maintenance is about one man to every 3 to 4 miles, and should be increased to one and a half men per mile. There is no difficulty in getting labour in S. E. Iran provided the labourers are given food. 7. Suitability for Tracked Vehicles .—Tracked vehicles should have no difficulty over the loose sand, but as the route now exists (November 1941) it is not practical for the passage of an armoured brigade. Provision must first be made for the passage of the wheeled portion of the brigade over the two sandy stretches mentioned above. 8. Scope of Movement by Tracks .—No stage of this route can be covered by moving.throughout on a broad front, because spurs of low hills or patches of broken country invariably force258 Route VII—Section D— contd. a formation back on to the road. At the same time stretches up to 15 miles can be covered on a front of up to some 3 miles right and left of the road. 9. Supply facilities .— (a) Water .—The route is unsuitable for marching troops owing to lack of water which is only available at ZAHIDAN (wells and karezes; ample for 2 Bdes) : NASRATABAD SIPI (8 small wells—saltish ; hardly enough for one Bn.; KAHURAK (small springs— brackish ; two gals per min.); FEHRUJ (24 L/D. 1) swampy nullah bed-saltish; VAKILABAD (mile 194, karez and stream 150 g.p.m.); and BAM (karez and stream, ample). (b) Camping ground.—The most suitable staging posts for convoys are— (i) ZAHIDAN—Plenty of space ; most suitable sites to N.E. of town near river. No cover from air. (ii) KAHURAK Bivouac only; unlimited space. (iii) BAM. To south and east before reaching the town Alternative VAKILABAD, 20 m. to S.E. (c) Supplies—For a large force would have to be brought by road from ZAHIDAN or up from BANDAR ABBAS, having been landed there by sea Local supp lies, e.g., goats, sheep, and cattle for 1,000 men, fruit and vegetables, and firewood, are only obtainable at BAM. (d) Local Transport—Mery difficult to obtain at the present time. (e) P.O. L.—The A. I. O. C. can place any amount of petrol, in tins, required at halting places, provided notice is given For areas, e.g., KAHURAK, where there are no A.I.O.C installations or accommodation guards are necessary. Normal stocks on the route.— Z/ 12 I 00 ) 0 A ' N ' _StOraS5fOr40 ’ ():,9tinS ' PreSent St0cks about BAM.—4,000 tins. , , , 10 - Generally speaking the climate is very healthy.

There are no gradients of note. 3. Character of adjacent country, —Infantry and cavalry and A. F. Ws can operate off the road on both sides throughout its length, except where occasional rocky and precipitous spurs and a short defile at mile 39 render movement difficult. Conceal ment from the air is totally lacking. 4. Climatic effects .—The rainfall is small but thunder storms (chiefly in May and June) may cause spates and block the road at the numerous nullah crossings. The road is seldom blocked by snow in its last 30 miles and never in its first 60 miles as the altitude is lower and the winter climate much milder. The heat in BAM in summer would make troop movements by day a trying ordeal for infantry. 5. Exceptional features. —Nil. 6.

GENERAL REPORT. !• Classification. B. 1. The road is reasonably good and suitable for lorry traffic. Sand sometimes causes hazards and it is liable to damage by rain, though never sufficiently seriously to interrupt communications. In November 1941, a sum of several lakhs of rupees was sanctioned for improvement, and the work is believed to be in hand (January 1942). 2. Surface and grading.Specification of the road as a whole, when work is complete, will be : 'A fair weather shingle road with passing places”. Parts of the route are already and will continue to be, above that standard. 3. Character of adjacent country .—For the greater part of the route the country is sandy barren desert, completely water less with occasional outcrops of limestone but excellent going for tracks There are occasional patches of sand, and others which are crossed by shallow nullans ; these portions are liable to be cut uo in bad weather. About 20 miles short of ZAHIDAN the road enters hilly country and starts to climb to the ZAHIDAN plateauRoute VIII—Section A— contd. The bills are rocky and barren, in many places commanding the road, and would probably have to be piquetted in the event of opposition. There is an excellent defensive position where the road debouches on to the plateau. 4. Railway communication—The road runs south of, and mostly adjacent to, the old NOK KUNDI—DUZDAP (ZAHIDAN) railway. The track, which still exists, is now being re-laid, and is expected to be completed early in 1942. 5. Climate. —Hot in summer, cold in winter. There is not much rainfall, but when it does occur the sandy portions of the road become boggy and may delay traffic considerably. 6. Supply facilities .— (a) Camping, grounds.—Good at MIRJAWA and ZAHIDAN. Others exist or could be made, but water would have to be transported. (b) Water—Good at MIRJAWA and ZAHIDAN; limited and brackish elsewhere. (c) Supplies. —Extremely limited ; would have to be carried or dumped. (d) Petrol. —At ZAHIDAN only. Storage for 40,000 tins ; present stocks (November 1941) about 12,000 tins. DETAILED REPORT. Classification. —B. 1. Mile* Inter. Total. 0 0 14 14 4 18 NOK KUNDI (30 L/D. 1. Old map). P.

The main characteristics of the country through which this road passes are deserts and mountains. The road presents entirely different aspects from the point of view of (a) M.T. and (b) marching troops There is little to hinder the passage of M. T. except certain places, seasonal rain, spates or snowfall. M.T. can traverse the waterless tracts easily in one stage without refilling. The normal running time for loaded M. T. between ZAHIDAN and MESHED is four days, suitable stages for military transporting being : 1st Day. 2nd Day. ZAHIDAN (30 C/S. 46)—QAIMABAD (1841 m). 3rd Day. QAIMABAD—BIRJAND (23 P/A. 1) (110£ m.). 4th Day. BIRJAND—MIANA (23 J/X 62) (184| m.). MIANA—MESHED (22 P/E 62) (139| m.) In summer lorries often run at night. The whole journey can be done m a touring car in two days, staging at BIRJANE) but it is a trying journey and it is better to allow three days. From the point of view of marching troops the problem is water and, without extensive arrangements for water convoys it may safely be said that the route is not a practicable one. Generally speaking it would be exceedingly difficult, on account of the water shortage, to march a larger body than an infantry battalion or cavalry regiment »long this route, and it would pro'- . ably be necessary for units to follow each other at stage intervals Some of the stages shown are for the same reason unavoidably long. 2. Classification. B. 1 throughout in dry weather, except tor short stages of C. 1. In wet weather surface classification 1 2 or 3 according to detailed report. lcssthL h 4yirds. 0fthetraCk VarieS ’ bU ‘ ° n tHe avera « e is not 'V .276 Route VIII—Section B— contd. 3. Surface and Grading—The surface is either metalled or sufficiently hard to be regarded generally as the equivalent of metalled. It suffers from deterioration in the spring from rain and spates. Metalling is sprinkled on but not rolled Pot holes are filled in on an average once a year. The surface of the roa&lt; ^ across the AMRANI desert cuts up badly in wet weather and would require maintenance. The mountain passages are narrow in places (see Detailed Report) and very steep for M.T., gradients reaching 1 in 6 and 7 in about 6 places. 4. Character of Adjacent Country —Stony desert, or open valleys flanked by barren hills. Entirely treeless except in the irrigated gardens. There are several transverse hill systems crossed between BIRJAND and MESHED. Any of these could be turned by a force organised on a pack basis. In most of the hilly districts diversion off the road by wheels would be impossible. The surface of the deserts, except in the salt wastes, is hard enough to permit A.F.V’s and tanks to manoeuvre without much difficulty excepting in very wet weather when the going would be very heavy and A.F.V’s might be confined to the road. 5. Climatic effects. —Summer temperatures in the deserts are extremely high, going up to 115° shade temperature. Nights are however cooler. In the hills the summer is temp &gt;rate Throughout the winter temperatures are very low, especially in the north. The rainfall is small, the rainy season lasting from January until the end of April. In the north snow may be expected from the middle of December to the end of March, someti i es until later. The mountain passes are blocked by snow for varying periods, particularly between TURBAT-I-HAIDARI and MESHED Road gangs generally succeed i.i clearing the passes within a we 2 k, often less. These passes could be kept open if extra labour was employed as soon as snow falls. Snow in this respect is less of an obstacle than in the higher mountains between MESHED and TEHRAN. Tnere are occasional spates in the spring, up to as late as the end of April, but normally they subside in a few hours and cause no great stoppage of traffic. There is practically no malaria Sandfly fever is prevalent in the southern desert districts. 6. Exceptional features —The passes between TURBAT-I- HAIDARI and KAFIR KALEH are narrow and would necessi' tate particularly careful traffic control. The largest unbridged river crossing is the KAL-I-TURUQ near MESHED, which aft 2 r heavy rains is impassable for two or three days. The river KAL A I-SHOR is bridged but the bridge is in a state of disrepair and is liable to fail in the rainy season.277 Route VIII—Section B— contd. 7. Repair facilities .—Road metal is normally available near the road alignment. The AMRANI section however would re quire imported stone. There are no team rollers. Labour, with shovels, is available in all the villages. 8. Campivg grounds .—The limiting factor is w’ater, other wise sites are not difficult to find. They are generally close to the road with easy approaches. In the hill ranges space is often limited. The open nature of the country facilitates defence though cover from view or from the air is scarce for the same reason. 9. Supply facilities —(a) Water .—As already pointed out, this is the chief difficulty which a force would have to face. From ZAHIDAN to SHUSP practically no supplv is avail able, except atHORMUKandSAFIDAWA. From SHUSP to BIRJAND the country, though still very barren, is slightly more fertile and water is more frequently met with. From BIRJAND to N1ESHED with the exception of the stages across the AMRANI desert, water can usually be found in sufficient quan tities for at least a battalion or cavalry regiment, sometimes for a brigade. “Water ambars” or “Houses”. These are small tanks with domed brick roofs They cannot be depended upon for a supply of water since many are allowed to fall into disrepair and others dry up in the summer. Their contents are often highly insanitary They normally contain water up till about June, when they become pools of liquid mud or dry. North of Birjand however a number still contained water in September. Karezes vary in capacity and depth. Many are much reduced in summer. (b) Suvplies .—Are available in certain areas particularly BIRJAND, KAIN, GUNABAD and TURBAT-I-HAIDARI. (i) Meat, in the form of sheep and goats, is plentiful nearly everywhere north of SHUSP. Cattle are scarce except in the immediate vicinity of the larger towns where they are kept more for milk than beef. A limited amount of beef could be obtained in BIRJAND, GUNABAD, TURBAT and Meshed but little elsewhere. (ii) In estimating the amount of wheat, barley, etc., availa ble it should be taken into account that the wheat is only grown in certain districts. Many places are not self-supporting and buy from areas where an excess crop is grown. The districts in eastern Iran that grow an excess crop are :— SEISTAN, KATN, TURBAT, MESHED, NISHA- PUR and SABZEWAR.278 Route VIII—Section TS—contd. The figures given in the Detailed Report are an estimate of the amount available immediately after the harvest and should be reduced by 1/12 for every month after July. A reserve which might represent from &gt;0 per cent to 20 per cent of the harvest figures would normally be available in June. Fodder is plentiful in grain growing districts. (iii) Vegetable and Fruit .—These are more plentiful in the north from TURBAT-I-HAIDARI onwards :— Potatoes are available in Meshed only. They are grown in the Russian frontier districts. Cabbages, brin- jals, carrots, onions, beans, etc., are available in quantity. Further south, beans, mustard plant and pumpkins only are grown where there is sufficient water. From KAIN northwards fruit is very plentiful and of excellent quality. All European varieties are found especially apricots, peaches, pomegranates, grapes and melons. South of KAIN fruit is still procurable in lesser quantities in all gardens. (iv) Miscellaneous Supplies .—Coal is found in the vicinity of MESHED in fair quantity and there is no doubt that the output could be increased. There is a well equipped leather factory in MESHED which turns out good boots and fair saddlery. Soap is made in quantity. There is a fruit canning factory. The villages produce good blankets, felt and cotton, cloth. (v) Petrol .—Obtainable in large quantitiess at ZAHIDAN BIRJAND, GUNABAD, TURBAT-I-HAIDARI and MESHED; small quantities at QAIMABAD, KAIN and BIDUKHT, also occasionally from tea houses en route.

Section GUNABAD—M IA N A via AMRANI DESERT (478 miles). Three stages. This is a difficult section on account of the waterless AMRANI DESERT. The first stage to the village of AMRANI is easy, the road is broad and good, the level drops slowly all the way. From AMRANI village (which is located some distance off the road and not as shown on the map) no further reliable water supply exists till MIANA is reached. There are salt streams and a few water ambars on the road but the supply would not be reliable and they certainly would dry up in summer. Water for marching troops would have to be carried for the intervening stage After rain the surface of the road across the desert becomes very soft and cut up. Arrangements would have to be made for maintenance if continuous use of the road by M.T. was contemplated. It has therefore been classified as B. 3 in wet weather.

Alignment and Brief Description. —The route is best considered in three stages.— (a) MESHED to QUCHAN (22 K/Y. 5000), 97 miles. Maps 22-P, L, K. As far as CHINARAN (22 P/E. 1158) the motor road follows the cart road as shown on the map. The roadway is some 22' wide with lateral ditches; but the surface is very cut up, and in olaces is covered with inches of dust. Apart from culverts the onlv bridges crossed are a stone bridge at Mile 3, a wooden one at Mile 37, and two small stone bridges at Miles 38 and 42. Two miles west of CHINARAN the route leaves the road marked on Map 22-P and runs west to the edge of the map at about E. 0257, continuing on the edge of Map 22-L (where “ Meshed 42 miles ” is printed). This track is the present motor road for about 30 miles to a point some 3 miles west of KAR- ACHAH(22L/C. 1. Old map). The road is without bridges and culverts, and undulates all the time into and out of nullahs. The surface is very corrugated, but as the surrounding earth is gravelly, there is a sort of natural metalling in the road. Heavy rain would score the surface of the road in the nullahs, but else where would not affect it. From three miles west of KARACHAH the road runs slightly to the east of the track marked on the map, to a point where the track on Map 22-K from QUCHAN reaches the edge of that map at D. 5287. It then follows the line of this track into QUCHAN. ^ Map 22 ( -K QUCHAN t0 BA J GIRAN (22 K/Y. 3356), 50 miles. For the first 5 miles after crossing the ATREK river (where a new bridge is being built), the road runs northwards, graduallv ascending over undulating ground towards the hills. Here the surface is good and the width of the roadway some 30', with315 Route VIII—Section C— contd. lateral ditches. As it enters the hills the road narrows to aboui 15 without lateral ditches, and is liable to damage from rain ; it also becomes slippery with snow in the winter, but is always passable with chains. The road continues hilly, crossing several passes and going through the narrow DURB ADAM gorge. Map 22-K is generally accurate. The road in this stage is at present (January 1942) being maintained by Russian engineers and labour platoons, who are engaged in widening and straightening bends on the mountain section. There is a telegraph line all the way, but it is broken at the frontier. At BAJGIRAN there is a Russian buying and trans port section controlled from MESHED. There are no Persian authorities at the frontier. (c) BAJGIRAN to ASKHABAD (22 K/Y. 2789). 30 miles Map 22-K. A first-class road with tarmac all the way, probably wide enough to take two-way traffic throughout. From BAJGIRAN the road rises slightly to a low kotal a the head of the valley, which is on the actual frontier line, and thence descends to the Russian frontier post of GAUDAN. T.O., frontier guards, and customs officials For a few miles after leaving GAUDAN the road keeps high above the bed of the stream, and then drops by a series of zigzags to the bottom of tht valley and then on down it. At 16 miles is what used to be, in of horse transport, the days the halfwav halting place. Limited water from a well. From here the road ascends over a low spur and then des cends suddenly to the level of the plain, across which it goes direct for the last 10 miles into ASKHABAD. There is no detailed information of Stage (c). 3. Climatic effects. The summer is mild, the winter bitterly cold. Though much snow falls, traffic is seldom impeded. Spates following rain might delay traffic for a few hours at the unbridged nullah crossings. 4. Repair facilities—Road material scarce to QUCHAN but labour should be plentiful, especially as far as CHINARAN ; the valley is dotted with villages and intensely cultivated. 5.

ROUTE IX—SECTION A MESHED to SHAHRUD Distance. —329 miles. Stages.—19. Reference sheets—22-V. 23-M, 22-L, 22-H, 22-D, 15-P. GENERAL REPORT 1. Classification. —B. 1. and in parts C. 1. 2. Surface and Grading. —Metalling is normally about 6 inches deep; the average width of the track where not restricted by natural feature is about 15 to 18 feet. Culverts are scarce. —There is little attempt to camber the profile, but flanking ditches exist in many places. Where it is not metalled the surface is normally hard and on the whole stands up to traffic well. Maintenance is fairly good, steam rollers do not exist The condition of the road is seasonal, being at its worst in April after the spring rains, and best in Autumn. 3. Character of the adjacent country. —The general alignment of the road is east and west along an extensive open vadey flanked on the north by a nearly continuous range of mountains. These run parallel to the road but after being crossed south of MESHED they do not approach the road nearer than about 4 to 5 miles. To the south the country tends to fall away to a waterless plain. Certain section cross hilly features which are fully described in the detailed report. Military operations off the road would generally be confined to infantry and cavalry and pack transport Artillery and A. F. Vs. could only be employed in certain areas unless considerable roadRoute IX—Section A— c ontd. construction was undertaken. The country is open and treeless, but on account of numerous watercuts and nullahs cover from view and fire can often be obtained. The nullah features are the princi pal obstacle to movement of wheels off the road. Cover from air is not good on the whole, and aircraft following the well- defined line of the road would probably spot troop movements. Camps could not be concealed easily. The shortage of water, which is a nearly universal feature of the whole Iranian Plateau, would be a decisive factor in military operations. 4. Climatic conditions— Summer—May till August-maxi mum day temperatures rarely go over 100 degrees except in the desert areas. Shade is very scarce. Nights are good. Winter .—Very severe, snow may be expected between December and April. Temperatures fall below zero. Adequate clothing, tentage, bedding and fuel are essentials. Fuel is not plentiful everywhere. Spring .—April and May—Heavy rainfalls in these months and spates are frequent in the vicinity of the hills. These, though severe, subside rapidly. Low-lying areas tend to flood, and this together with snow on the higher passes forms the principal climatic obstacle to troop movements. 5. Exceptional Features—O The TUTUQ river near MESHED. This is unbridged, and after heavy rain is sometimes impassable for two to three days. (ii) The PUL-I-ABRASHAM near ABBASABAD. Alow lying salt desert, which becomes flooded every spring for varying periods. The soil being soft and road metal non-existent, this section becomes impassable for M. T. and occasionally for all arms, for varying periods which may extend up to 10 days. The road which is well made with imported metal and embanked tends to sink into mud and requires constant maintenance. (iii) The hill system between MESHED and SHARIFABAD. The road for about 12 miles is narrow and winding, traffic control would be advisable if much M. T. was running. Gradients are steep. Snow lies thickly on this sector in winter and it is occa sionally closed for a few days at a time. 6 Repair Facilities. —Generally speaking road metal is plentiful in' the vicinity of the road. Labour and tools are avail able in all villages. 7 Supply Facilities—These are referred to in the detailed rpnort ’ The onlv areas capable of producing supplies for any Considerable quantity of troops are MESHED, SHARIFABAD, KADAMGA NISHAPUR. SABZAWAR, MIAMAI, SHAHRUD. Supplies consist of wheat, barley, bran. Meat on hoof. Fruit322 Route IX —Section A— contd. in season. The amount of fuel available is at its maximum after harvest and at its minimum in May and June. Water—There are certain waterless stages for which water would have to be carried for men and transport animals. It may be taken as a rule, that with the exception of the hill districts, the absence of villages is a certain indication of the absence of water. Almost all available supplies are used for cultivation. a cufSn7ik arge r stocks are heId at MESHED, SABZAWAR and oriAriRUD; a few tins at most roadside tea houses. DETAILED REPORT. Map 22-P.

The country on both sides of the road is open and fertile, though less so than to the west ol KADAMGA. Irrigation streams are crossed by Irish bridges which become more frequent as NISHAPUR is approached. Villages with cultivation are passed at frequent intervals and the country is fairly well irrigated. There are few villages in the immediate proximity of the road.

This is the last place where water can be obtained short of ABBASABAD 23 miles further on. This next stage lies entirely across the LUT, and the la-st 15 miles in winter or during heavy rains, presents one of the principal obstacles on the MESHED—TEHRAN route both to M. T. and marching troops.335 ni Route IX—Section A— contd. Miles. Classification. Inter. Total. The country opens out into a barren salt plain sloping gradually to the south. Through the middle of the plain winds the ABRESHAM river, quite dry in summer but liable to flood its banks and the surrounding country for perhaps 5 or 6 miles in the rains. The water is brackish and practically undrinkable. Hundreds of other small water channels also intersect the plain, which is entirely composed of salty earth. No stone is available for road metalling. The section, liable to flood on either side of the river for a distance of some miles, is embanked and protected with dykes. In spite of these precautions it is normally closed to M.T. by Hoods in winter and spring, as late as April, for varying periods, extending occasionally to a fort night at a time. Infantry might be able to cross with difficulty. The road embankment is made up of imported stone, but tends to settle into the soft earth in the wet season. It would require considerable maintenance. B. 1 l£ 216| Road enters lut. 1 4 220£ Road liable to flood in wet weather. (In floods impassable for all arms.) B. 1 i 2201 Watch tower (deserted).

The stages are very hard for marching troops on account of shortage of water. The country traversed consists of a succession of small hills and very broken country entirely devoid of water or cultivation. The stages are unavoidably long, and in summer exceedingly hot. Night marching would be advisable. The section between ABBASABAD and MIAMAI formerly had a bad reputation on account of Turkoman raiders, and it is still possible that an enterprising enemy with local guides might be able to surprise a column passing through this very broken country.wm ir hi i i 337 Route IX—Section A— contd.

W. from SHAHRUD to SAM- NAN (115 miles) and west from SAMNAN to TEHRAN (140 miles). 2. Classification. —B. 1 and in places C. 1. 3. Surface and Grading. —This road is soled with rough hewn stone to depth of 4 inches and metalled with shingle to a depth of 4 inches. The foundation consists of the hard soil of the Iranian plateau. It is cambered and has a ditch on either side to carry off surface water. In some places these ditches serve a secondary purpose, i.e., that of irrigation channels conducting a stream parallel to the road till a shallow depression permits it to cross the road by an unpaved Irish bridge. When first put down the shingle is rolled in with a steam or man drawn roller except in the mountainous parts where rammers are used but for purposes of subsequent repair the shingle is poured on loose by road gangs. Thus, when badly in need of repair the Iranian road may present a badly rutted appearance owing to the shingle having been piled up in the centre or the sides by the action of the wheels of traffic. 4. Character of Adjacent Country. —This section divides itself into four clearly defined portions, viz, the SHAHRUD— DAM iHAN plain of 70 miles, a more or less mountainous strip separating that plain and the SAMNAN plain 38 miles in length, the SAMNAN plain of 17 miles and the intensely mountainous portion from there to TEHRAN consisting of 130 miles. In the two mountainous portions th^ road is commanded from hills on the north and south for almost its entire length and is suitable for air attack as there are few places where transport can get off the road. 5. Climatic Effects. —In summer temperature of 110° may be experienced on the DAMGHAN and SAMNAN plains. In the mountainous portions it is cooler. The heat to be met with on the old road via VERA MIN on the edge of the KAVIR was reasons for the construction of the new road via FIRUZKUH. In winter, between December and February the road is liable to be blocked periodically by snow for 4 or 5 days at a tima on the two passes east and west of FIRUZKUH and also the three high portions between the NIMRUD river and TEHRAN (it wa s^ ... 343 Route IX— Section B—contd. closed for 14 days on end in December 1931) but labour concentra ted at the vital points should be able to affect a clearance in three days. In April and Mav when the snow melts the road is liable to be considerably damaged by flood water, though the likelihood of interruption from this cause has been lessened by the substitution of stone or concrete bridges and culverts for the wooden ones. Picks and shovels should be carried by all vehicles and every JVb l. convoy should carry beams of 6 inches diameter and 10 feet lengt i for making ramps or repairing culverts and road subsidences oi to shore up weak portions. Chains should be carried by all vehicles to cope with snow or mud. 6. Exceptional Features. —(a) Rivers. The chief rivers met with are:— (i) the NIMRUD at mile 483; (ii) the RUD-I-HIND at mile 535 ; (iii) the JAJARUD at mile 549. All of which are adequately bridged. (b) Passes .—There are five notable ascents, viz. : (i) The pass at mile 412%. (ii) The BASHM pass at mile 458|. (iii) The 7 mile ascent from the NIMRUD river mile 4821—489|. (iv) The 3 mile ascent from DILICHAI, mile 498|—501i (v) The 4 mile ascent from the JAJARUD, mile 549 553. These are all graded but they are long and steep and prove a serious obstacle to much of the civilian M. T. overloaded and overdriven by Iranians. (c) Bridges .—The bridges are, on the whole, strong and well made up to heavy M. T and are daily used by 7 ton lorries with- out visible signs of damage. (d) Fords —These are numerous in the two plain portions and consist of Irish bridges unpaved across irrigation cuts and stony nullahs dry in summer but liable to become blocked by mud or boulders brought down by the water in spring. _ (e) Tunnels .—There is only one tunnel in this section at mile 502. It is strongly constructed and its dimensions will permit the transit of the largest M. T. with ease. 7 Repair Facilities —Unlimited quantities of stone and shingle are available throughout the length of , steam rollers were seen until within P miles of TEHRAN where two were working (August 1933).344 Route IX—Section h—contd. Local labour is procurable and it is estimated 0 933) that the Ministry of Roads and Communications employ a man a mile on maintenance duties. 8. Supply Facilities—{i) Camping grounds.—Are good and extensive but provide no cover from air. Water.—Is plentiful and good except from mile 377—419| where it is scarce. (iii) Supplies .—The wayside villages can supply meat, fruit* bread, eggs and barley in very limited quantities, the towns of SHAHRUD, DAMGHAN and SAMNAN could maintain a brigade indefinitely. After the harvest (July) considerable quan tities of barley are available. (iv) Fuel .—Cut firewood is never plentiful in Iran except in the large cities. Considerable quantities of brushwood is available on this section and large groves of poplars are to be seen on the banks of the rivers. (v) Grazing .—Is good in the mountainous portions of this section. (vi) Fodder .—Is never plentiful in Iran but a sytematized collection of barley straw over a large area would produce consi derable quantities. (vii) Rapair Facilities .—Generally speaking the wayside gara ges and tea shops can produce a few tins of petrol and oil. Stocks are maintained in the towns only. The amounts available are shown in the detailed report. Roadside garages exist at SHAH RUD, DAMGHAN, FIRUZKUH and RUDIHIND where spare parts most in demand for American lorries can be had in very limited quantities. Blacksmiths available to carry out rough repairs. In TEHRAN most of the leading makers of American lorries are represented by stockists of spare parts. Lathes are to be found. Acetylene welding can be done but there is a dearth of skilled mechanics. (viii) Petrol and oil .— Large stocks are held at DAMGHAN and SAMNAN; a few tins at most roadside tea-houses.

ROUTE X—SECTION A FIRUZKUH to SHAHI. Distance. —67 miles. Number of stages. —5. Reference sheets. —16-A, 15-D. GENERAL REPORT—SECTIONS A &amp; B. 1. Classification. —B. 1 throughout in all weathers. 2. Surface and Giading. —An unsoled road of average width of 12'—properly ditched and cambered. It is lightly metalled to a depth of 4' or shingled. The only severe gradients are those averaging 1 : 12 and attaining 1 : 5 on the 15-mile descent 0 n the CASPIAN side of the ABBASABAD pass. 3. Character of Adjacent Country. —Sharply divisible into high, arid, bleak mountain or plateau (mile 0 to 35) and low lying, humid, fertile coastal plain (the remainder). Operations off the road are possible on both sides of the road for all arms only from mile 0 to Ilf, the summit of the pass. Thereafter as far as mile 60 a narrow valley with high and steep sides effectively prevents all movement off the road for any arm but infantry or mountain artillery. Thereafter movement off the road is possible for all arms though inundated paddy fields would prove a serious obsta cle to A. F. V.’s. Concealment from the air is totally lacking until the tree line is reached at about 2,000 feet at mile 42 (ZIRAB). 4. Climatic Effect. —On the plateau, mile 0 to 11, the sum mer is mild and the cold in winter is intense.Route X~Section A~contd. Ram falls chiefly in late November and in April and May, while occasional thunderstorms of great violence commonly usher in the summer in early June. Snow falls in December, January, February and early March and the ABBASABAD pass was, till railway construction imported labour in large quantities, frequently closed for 2 or 3 days at a time twice or thrice a year by snow drifts. * On the plain, the winter is mild and the summer hot, very humid and malarious. The worst months are July, August and September. Rain may fall at anytime. 5. Exceptional Features—{i) The ABBASABAD pass, the frequency of mist and rough weather on the top and the steepness of the descent (ii) The tactical difficulty presented by the long descent (mile 11 to 60) in the steep sided and narrow TALAR valley. 6. Repair Facilities. Metal is available throughout. Timber is abundant from mile 30 to 45 on the mountain sides and on the roadside thereafter. No steam rollers were seen. Labour is plentiful throughout and the construction of the Trans-Iranian Railway (which runs parallel to the road and alongside from mile 11 to 67) should have taught the local inhabitants much in earth stone and timber work. 7. Supply Facilities, (i) Camping grounds. —Suitable sites are very rare owing in the earlier stages to the narrowness and steepness of the valley down which the road runs from mile 11 to 60 and thereafter owing to the intense cultivation (much of it Wa A r ;i 0 Q^ e Tr d rfr d c d jD le / d 'i nS AHI (mile671 .

(iii) Supplies. —Plentiful at FIRUZKUH SMART BABUL Fairly plentiful at MESHED -1-S A R w h i c 1U m ports food (except fish) from B ABUL. Scarce elsewhere.

Reference Sheets. —9-M, 8 -P. GENERAL REPORT. 1. General Description of Route .—This route, knotvn by the Iranians as the “ Rah-i-Makhsus ” or “ The Special Road ”, was completed in 1933 by order of the Shah at a cost of over £1 million. He desired a road offering more rapid transit from TEHRAN to his MAZANDERAN estates than either the KAZVIN/RESHT (Route XII) or the FIRUZKUH/SHAHI (Route X) roads. He also wanted a direct route from those estates to the Iranian plateau to facilitate the export of his produce. The result is a road which, in its bold conception and skilful construction, can have few equals in the world; the scenery too is magnificent. From a strategic point of view, it is of increasing importance as an alternative route from TEHRAN and KAZVIN to the ports on the Caspian Sea. 2. Classification. —B. 1 only, owing to steep gradients and numerous sharp bends. 3. Surface and Grading .—A soled and metalled road of average width of 12-14', adequately cambered and ditched. It appears to have been repaired recently (September 1941) though there were still portions under repair near CHALUS. All bridges are strongly built of stone, and masonry revetting has been used wherever necessary. The gradients over the ELBURZ mountains though well engineered are steep, and there are many sharp bends. A tunnel 1^ miles long has been constructed through the apex of the KANDAVAN Pass. If heavy lorries were to use the road386 Route XI—Section A— contd. continuously one way traffic would be desirable over the steeper stretches. 4. Character of adjacent country. —Mountainous to within five miles of CHALUS ; only infantry and pack artillery could operate off the road. From KARAJ the road enters a wide valley ; this soon narrows to a gorge with high precipitous sides which continues to the pass. Beyond the tunnel the road descends through another rocky gorge until it reaches the densely wooded country of the foothills. The coastal plain along the southern shore of the CASPIAN Sea is enclosed and cultivated. 5. Climatic Effects. —Every endeavour has been made to make this an all-weather route and by means of the tunnel to over come the difficulty of snow at the highest point; numerous cement shelters have also been built at places liable to avalanche. Nevertheless it is reported that the road is occasionally blocked by snow or landslides. 6 . Obstacles. —Apart from the tunnel, there are over 50 bridges the destruction of which would delay a force for several hours until repairs were carried out. 7. Intercommunication.—-A telephone line follows the road throughout. 8 . Repair facilities—Road metal and timber are abundant. The Iranian government used to employ as many as five men per mile on maintenance. 9. Supply Facilities .— (i) Camping grounds. —Very cramped; only occasional bivouac sites. (ii) Water and Fuel. —Abundant. (iii) Fodder and Supplies. —Scarce. (iv) P.O.L. Plentiful at KARAJ; scarce at CHALUS. r-rj a (^Hotels. There is an excellent European-run hotel at CH ALUS. 10.

The road traverses a dead flat coastal plain, with the CASPIAN Sea on the right, usually hidden from view by sand dunes, a belt 1-5 miles wide of dense forest or cultivation on the left, and beyond this the ELBURZ range. Operations off the road are thus limited, but there is plenty of cover from air ; the road is tree- lined. After LAHIJAN a slight change is visible. The hills recede to the south, leaving a coastal strip 40 miles wide in the centre of which runs the road. 4. Climatic Effects .—Mild in winter malarious in summer. hot, humid and 5. Exceptional Features .—The chief feature of this section are the many rivers and streams, and the massive concrete bridges that have been erected over them. The most notable rivers are the CHALUS, PUL-I-RUD and SAFID RUD. The hill streams y \ lisble to sudden rise from storms; the Murdab or lagoon streams are more constant. 6.

Climatic effects. —The cold in winter is intense from mile 0 to 27 and the heat in summer mild. Snow falls from Decem ber to February but seldom interrupts traffic. Rain falls chiefly from March to April with occasional thunderstorms in May and June and these may cause spates which necessitate the clearing of boulders and debris from the road. From mile 27 to the end the winter is mild and the heat in summer very trying with the added discomfort of great humidity from mile 100 to the end. Rain falls chiefly between November and April. 5.

Supply facilities—(i) Camping grownds—Suitable sites are to be found everywhere on the plateau, mile 0—27. From mile 27 to 56 there are no good sites in the narrow and steep sided gorge. Good sites are again rare in the SAFID RUD gorge and in the flat jungle country at mile 102 . (ii) Water. —Plentiful throughout, though the SAFID RUD, especially when high, carries a lot of red silt and requires settling tanks. (iii) Supplies. —Abundant at KAZVIN and RESHT, plenti ful at MANJIL and RUDBAR, scarce elsewhere.

Classification —A. 1.—This stage is used bv heavy M T. throughout its entire length in all seasons. It is 'capable of two way traffic except on the short stretch noted in the detailed report. 3. Surface and grading .—There is no proper soling on the road. The ground of the Iranian plateau is very hard. Metalling consists of shingle to a depth of 4 inches. This is usually rolled in with a steam (or man-drawn) roller when the road is first con structed but is subsequently poured on loose by road gangs. Thus when badly in want of attention, the road may present a deeply rutted appearance, the shingle being piled up at the edges or in the centre by the wheels of vehicles. Grading is good. There are no ascents which, either on account of their length or their steepness, would prove a serious obstacle to fully laden M. T. Great care is, however, necessary when negotiating sharp bends on a steep slope as the almost complete lack of revetting renders their outer edge liable to crumble and this materially lessens the width of the safe portion.415 Route XIII—Section A.— contd. 4. Character of adjacent country—This section traverses for the most part open moorland at an average altitude of nearly 5,000 feet. The high mountains of the ELBURZ range lie at an average distance of 10 miles on one’s right hand (i.e., to the north). Isolated hills or lower ranges may he near the road at infrequent intervals (noted in the detailed report) but it cannot be said that the road during this stage is commanded from them. Cover from air, except at nullah crossings where the preci pitous sides would afford shade, is completely lacking. 5. Climatic effects—ii) Rain falls intermittently in the autumn, winter and spring and the weather does not become settled until the latter half of May. Owing to the altitude of the country traversed and the nature of the soil this stage is only affected by heavy and continuous downpours and then chiefly at nullah crossings. (ii) Spates are frequent during the spring and local and temporary stoppages of traffic may occur. (iii) Snow falls between the end of December and the middle of March but not to any great depth. It does not he for long and local labour should be procurable to clear any short stretches such as the summits of passes. Skid chains should be carried by all vehicles at all times to ccpe with snow or mud. (iv) The maximum temperatures (1913-1919 July) is 105*2 and the minimum (1913-1919 February) 19*5 Though these figures relate to Tehran they should apply to the whole of this section within the limits of a few degrees. 6 . Exceptional features, (i) Rive rs. There are no rivers to be met with on this section. (ii) Passes .—There are no high passes on this section nor any long ascents (iii) Fords —Are numerous. Spates are liable to render these impassable for 12 hours. (iv) Irish Bridges .—Occur to the number of several hund reds. Spates or heavy rainfall may block these with heaps of stone aid mud. Picks and shovels should be carried by all vehicles. (v) Bridges .—There are no bridges of any importance on t his section. (vi) Culverts and sudden depressions—These are numerous broken springs' (To ' avoiTbroken springs drivers should take416 Route XIII—Section A—contd. them diagonally, though, if taken thus at speed, chassis strain and distortion result.) Vehicles operating independently should each carry a spare front and rear spring and a convoy, a proportion. (vii) Tunnels. —There are no tunnels on this section. 7. Road repairs. —(i) Material. —Shingle is available for metalling throughout the entire length of this section. Timber (felled) is available at KAZVIN and in considerable quantity (unfelled) in the poplar groves near KHURRAM DARREH (mile 56) and throughout this section wherever sufficient water for fruit cultivation is found. (ii) Unskilled labour is obtainable from the villages en route and it was estimated (August, 1933) that the Iranian Govern ment Road Department employs a man a mile cn maintenance duties. (iii) Not more than two steam rollers are available on this stage, one at KAZVIN and one at ZINJAN. Three heavy concrete man-drawn rollers were seen (August, 1933) in use on this section. 8. Supplies. —(i) Camping grounds. —These, owing to the open nature of the country and the abundance of water, are numerous. Approaches are simple as they lie alongside the road. A field of fire 400*—600* is available from most. None are so commanded that a few picquets could not protect them sufficiently. (ii) Water is abundant and good mostly in the form of mountain brooks the yield of which, if conserved and regulated, would be sufficient for a brigade unless stated to the contrary in the detailed report. Pumps would be required. In rainy weather or when the snow is melting settling tanks would have to be provided. (iii) Supplies—These consist of meat, barley and wheat, fruit and eggs. Vegetables are scarce. The amounts will vary according to the season but, broadly speaking, supplies are most plentiful in August {i.e , after the harvest). The towns of K^ZVIN and ZINJAN would maintain a brigade for a week whereas the villages en route could feed no force larger than a company. Prior arrangements however could ensure a large supply of grain at any point en route without much delay or trouble local pack transport being available for its collection (iv) Fuel. Brushwood and dry thorn is obtainable at every village where a stock sufficient to last the winter is maintained by every house, but wood is scarce and could only be procured outside the big towns of KAZVIN and ZINJAN by' cutting down poplars and fruit trees. Coal is unobtainable except at TEHRAN (93 miles from KAZVIN).417 Route XIII—Section A—contd. (v) Fodder is very scarce The Iranians feed barley and straw, but the number of horses kept is very small. The number of mules kept is decreasing annually owing to successful com petition by mechanical transport. Donkeys are plentiful but are fed chiefly on dried thorn. (vi) Grazing is abundant and grass is to be found on this section all the year round. (vii) Petrol and oil are obtainable in bulk at KAZVIN and ZINJAN only (for amounts see detailed report). The smaller hamlets stock a few tins only for sale to passing lorry drivers in emergency at greatly enhanced rates. (viii) M. T. Repairs .—Outside KAZVIN and ZINJAN repair facilities do not exist. These two towns stock a fair number of spare parts of the better known makes of A.merican lorry but skilled mechanics or properly equipped workshops are totally lacking. DETAILED REPORT. Map 8-H.

Classification. —A. 1. This section is used by heavy M. T. throughout its entire length, in all seasons. It is capable cf two way traffic except in the short stretches noted in the detailed report, and classified B. 1. 3. Surface and grading. —See paragraph 3 of General Report on Section A. 4. Character of adjacent country. — In this section open moorland and deep valleys alternate. The moorland is very high and very exposed. The valleys are for the most part wide. The descent into some of them is steep with numerous hairpin bends. Thus the route is one long switchback consisting of (on an average) a 2 mile ascent; a mile of level; a mile descent to cross a valley and then the ascent and so on. In this section the road is com manded to a greater extent than in section A owing to :— (i) The proximity of the hills. (ii) The numerous dips into the valleys. (iii) The existence of gorges and passes through and over which the road runs. Cover from air is non-existent. i 5. Climatic effects. See paragraph 5 of General Report on section A but note that more snow falls in this section than in section A and that civilian transport is frequently held up in winter for 10 days at a time owing to snow on the SHIBLI pass Special arrangements would appear to be necessary to clear this. 6. Exceptional features—(i) Rivers—The ZINJAN CHAI (which flows parallel to the south of the road, for the first 50 miles), the QIZIL UZUN (which is crossed at mile 179 and the fw ch 15 fo ! 1 ° we ? for another 4 miles) and the KARAN- GU CHAI (crossed 3 miles S. E of MIANEH) are the only rivers of importance met with in this section. (nj Masses, in this section there are several long asce and descents several short and steep ascents and descents and c pass (the SHIBLI). In fair weather they present no r : 1 ~ J; , . earner tney present no bstacle to heavy M. T. but in snow or very wet weather cha425 Route XIII—Section B— contd. would be essential. In wet weather heavily laden M. T. should avoid using the edges of the road, the inner edge being soft and the outer liable to collapse through lack of revetment. (iii) Fords. —Fords are numerous. Spates are liable to render these impassable for 12 hours. (iv) Irish bridges. —Occur to the number of several hundred. Spates or heavy rainfall may block these with heaps of stone or mud. Picks and shovels should be carried by all vehicles. (v) Bridges. —There are numerous bridges in this section. The larger trestle bridges of wood are being gradually replaced by stone structures. There are in addition many wooden bridges over narrow nullahs. Their construction almost invariably follows this plan in :— Average Length 15 &gt; ROAD METAL • This type is used for all short bridges and as the nullah sides are usually almost vertical, it would be difficult to find alternative crossing places. For this reason all convoys should carry some baulks of timber say 10 feet long of 6 inches diameter for bridge repairs especially over stages where no timber is to be found. This type of bridge is referred to, in the detailed report, as a standard bridge. (vi) Culverts and sudden depressions. —These are numerous to provide passage for irrigation water. They are all of the switch- back variety and any failure to reduce the speed of laden vehicles to 15 m. p. h. or'touring cars to 20 m.p. h. may cause broken springs. To avoid broken springs drivers should take them diagonally, but, it so taken at speed, chassis strain and distortion may result. Vehicles operating independently should each carry a spare froitt and rear spring and a convoy, a proportion. (vii) Tunnels. —There are no tunnels on this section. 7. Road repairs. —(i) Material. —Shingle is available for metalling throughout the entire length of this section. Timber (felled) is available at KAZVIN and in considerable quantity (un felled) in the groves on both sides of the ZINJAN CHAI for a426 Route XIII—Section B contd. distance of 20 miles N. W. of ZINJAN. Other scattered groves occur. (ii) Unskilled labour—Is obtainable from the villages en route and it is estimated (August 1933) that the Iranian Govern ment Road Department employs a man a mile on maintenance duties. (iii) Not more than two steam rollers are available on this section both of which are at TABRIZ. Two heavy concrete man drawn (or horse drawn) rollers were seen (August, 1933) in use on this section. 8. Supplies. —(i) Camping grounds. —These are many and extensive. Exits and entrances are easy. A field of fire of from 400 x to 600 x is available from most. Cover from air is non-exist ent. In comparison with the camping grounds in section A these are more commanded from neighbouring high ground. (ii) BAater.—Is abundant and good mostly in the form of mountain brooks the yield of which if conserved and regulated would be sufficient for a brigade unless stated to the contrary in the detailed report. Pumps would be required. In rainy weather or when the snow is melting settling tanks would have to be provided. (iii) Supplies—These consist of meat, barley and wheat, fruit and eggs. Vegetables are scarce. The amounts will vary according to the season but broadly speaking' supplies are most plentiful in August (t.e., after the harvest). The towns of MIANEH and TABRIZ would maintain a brigade for a week and a year respectively whereas the villages en route could feed a force no larger than a company. Prior arrangements however would ensure a large supply of grain at any point en route without much delay or trouble, local pack transport being available for its collection. (iv) Fuel. —Brushwood and dry thorn is obtainable at every village where a stock sufficient to last the winter is maintained by every home but wood is very scarce and could only be procured outside the big towns of MIANEH and TABRIZ by cutting down poplars and fruit trees. Coal is unobtainable except in TEHRAN ' (v) Fodder.—Fodder is very scarce. The Iranians feed barley and straw, but the number of horses kept is very small. The number of mules kept is decreasing annually owing to success ful competition by mechanical transport. Donkeys are plentiful but are fed chiefly on dried thorn. (vi) Grazing. —Is abundant and grass is to be found on this section all the year round. (vii) Petrol and od.—Petrol and oil are obtainable in bulk at MIANEH and TABRIZ only (for amounts see detailed report). The smaller hamlets stock a few tins only for sale to passing lorry drivers in emergency at greatly enhanced rates.427 Route XlII—Section B— contd. (viii) Repairs .—The town of TABRIZ contains numerous stokists of spare parts for American lorries. Blacksmiths abound but are no properly equipped garages. Outside TABRIZ on repair facilities exist.

Chains are advisable for both contingencies. 5. Exceptional Features :— (a) Rivers.—The GEDAR CHAI and TATAVI CHAI are the only rivers of any importance. They are both adequately bridged ; alternative crossings would be difficult. (b) Passes. —High moorland beyond MAHABAD. Gradients on MAHABAD side are severe. (c) Fords.—Several Irish bridges which are liable to be blocked by stones and mud during spates. 6. Repair Facilities. —Road metal plentiful except in the SULDUZ and MIANDOAB plains. 7. Supply Facilities :— (a) Camping grounds. —Plentiful; but very little shade or cover from air. (b) Water. —Plentiful. (c) Supplies. —Plentiful in SULDUZ plain after harvest, at MAHABAD and MIANDOAB.

The volume, which is numbered I, covers the main routes in Persia, and was produced by the General Staff, India. It was printed by M Abdul Hameed Khan, Manager of the Feroz Printing Works, Lahore, in 1942. An introduction (folio 3) states that the volume has been updated on the basis of reports received in the wake of the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Persia in August 1941.The volume comprises details of sixty-five routes, listed on the contents page, between various towns and cities in Persia. Details given for each route include:an overview (distance, number of stages, references to maps);a general report (classification of route, surface and grading, character of adjacent country, climatic effects, exceptional features, repair and supply facilities, water, fuel, fodder and grazing supplies);a detailed report (villages and other landmarks encountered, road classifications, distances).A handwritten annotation on folio 5 (author unknown) states that ‘distances are somewhat overestimated throughout this report.’ The volume includes a map in a pocket attached to the inside back cover (folio 246).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>General Staff Branch</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Motor transport</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Surveys</topic></subject><subject><topic>Roads</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x000133#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
