Dear Prior, Some time ago I sent you a copy of the proposed Municipal Bye Law. It has not yet been anproved by the Agency. I now find _ thatj you already had one, sent direct some time ago by the Secretary and the one~ I sent is the Baladya cony. '7ould you please return one of the two copies. Yours sincerely, L j is k—‘ ' ' h. ^ iU '~ ^ n I n L ^ &gt; Ih ~ •' 'cS %2nd April 1930. President and- ■ • Jo tda Members of the -UaJUUTiah -ladiy cd?. Gentlemen. I welcome you to Uie new uajlis 'Vid coitd'-atulate you on the confidence the public have shovn in electin : you. Jon see a different own before you, co 'oorcd v;lth the Manar'iah of ten years a v ;o 3 'uid 'iany peoole have told me th:it they consider lananah and Muherraq far cleaner than Basrah or Ba ;hdad, and your predeceasora deserve Teat praise for v/hat they acco plishod. :iuch however still remains to be done principally in the line of prevent ion of illness and disease, and care of infants and children. If an enemy landed in,Bahrain and killed a hundred babies y you uculd rush to the defence of your tovm , but flies and disease kill hundreds a year, and no one thinks of it. All count -ries are now realising its importance f and the : uharraq Baladiyah, by on a lay a midwife have shown t!mt the are not behind the times* ^ill of us owe our lives of to the care our mothers took fsos us when infants and v/e can show our ratitude by providing uelp foi* this jeneration of worn- en at the time of child birth. Hundreds df mothers die unneceerarily evez^y r year in these islands. Malaria has increased 50 % in the last year, and we have seen at Qalaii that itm2- it c^-in kill many people in a abort i:ae Ualaria caii easily ic presented by not allowing musquitoes to oreed, and at Kliarw tom n the Sudaii it has be eh stamped out. If you ish you can reduce it here too. .wS regards finance. If I had a criticism to make of the last llajlis t it ii wob that ? as property/ owners, the;/ were somewhat too considerate of their wn pock -ets. A committee 2like this ^pr sed-of th» ieadin ; citizens is naturally comp sed of men of property, but they should always think only of what will benefit the people and not what eff cos their personal inter ests. You will remember that the last Uaj* lis wished to alter part of the house tax to a tobacco tax, and I am f ^aid that so:i&lt; i 11- -1 w J. -■ ‘-■v- a. a- U^ s-w* -* - ~ ^ J- tr e oniiUviu,., ox ^neir own property when i1 was proposed. Again, when the affairs of ^3V property of individual members is discussec they should always withdraw unless the Maj« lis wish to ask them questions, until the matter is settled. Just as there are many -ho continually have the name of God on the their lihps but have not him in thei r heart so there are those who while urging the cl aims of the poor, take take care to do no- thing that a^/ hurt their^own interests. #e shall be Judged not by our words but by our actions. I hope more consideration will be gi\en to rulesbefore they are passed. As you know, iany rules have been passed, and then cancelled almost as soon as they were published, A small town like Manansah does not require many at all, and the fewer and simpler they are, the more easily will peos rememberremember and obey them* When .passing resolution ve should &lt;ike eertain that a a sl.ailv.a* one has net already been passed and members will be well advised to see wl what n&amp;s already been passed deieded. Your .arden is much admired by all visitors to Bahrain, and the Hon’ble * Colonel Biscoe remarked on it* The Majlis may well be proud of it* Much can be done now to beautify the towni and I surest th t the Baladiyah should gradually acquir the open land on the ouskirts of the town as has been done at harac 1 and na ndad anu plan a suburb with wide and straight roads. With approv ~al of Govern ont, a public body can alway compulsorily acquire lunC for a public pu pose by paying a suit- J e price for compensation. you were to make such suburb your children and children’s children will remember you with gratitude, and their improved health will be your reward. me as a friend who is re tidy to help you to the best of his ability, and I ould like to close by proposing a vote of thanks to Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Isa, your honoured president, and tn« embers of the Majlis for the work they did on behalf of us all You have the raone t ror it cuid if I hope you v/ill always look on^ ’ cj-^ s ^ £&gt; f V 3 CN ^ \°t cr- u&gt;^\ cT \ ^ ' cr' ^^ ^ A ^ ^ &gt;A' ^'/v c ^ C XJ3 ^ -&gt; V V ^ u c&gt; vk^o V j ^ y jyt v c&gt;[c.r r v^i Si not keep more than what has been mentioned above* Anybody who got more than the number quoted above,can keep the same in the Baladejcah store at Suwaifeyah on payment of a small rent to be agreed to with the Baladeyah.

All kerosene oil ad petrol sellers are hereby notified tAnfijL- that a store at Suwaifeyah has been cast e4 by the Municipality adjacent to the store of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for storing kerosene oil and petrol in it on payment of a fixed rent to be decided between the Municipality and the owner of the abov^mention# ed articles. Nobody is therefore allowed to kep more than what has been fixdd by the Municipality ie.,fc5 tins petrol and 50 tins kerosene oil in his places which are situated within the Municipality limits. Anybody having more than the above quantity, he shoul^tore them in th^unicpality store referred to above. After the promulgation of this Aalan,the Municipality will arrange for a perpetual inspection of the places in which the bbove two kinds are sold. If anybody is found in possession of more than the fixed quantity, the excess will immediately be confiscated by the Municipality arid a case will be filed against the owner. To be known.-7 w f 7- Translation of letter No.416/135^ dated 3rd Rama.clhan 1352 from the Secretary,Muharraq Municipality, to Lieut-Colone1 Gordon Loch.Political Agent ,Bahrain. After Compliments. I beg to inform you that it has been decided in the Muharraq Municipal Council which was held on 2&lt;±th Sha’aban 1352 that the foreign peddlers who sell piece-goods in the quarters and villages of Muharraq should obtain permission from the Government for doing so. That they should sell on cash as most of them sell to the families in the houses on credit. The buyer, on seeing that it is easy to get the cloth offered and on being highly impressed by the seller and also seeing that the price is to be paid later,he makes his purchases and in this way a heavy debt will be incurred by him with the incorrect account rendered by the seller. After all that,the purchaser will have to be asked to pay his debt and thus he will be put to inconvenience for payment of such accumulated debt. If, on the other hand, the sale is effected by ready cash,the purchaser takes precaution and does not purchase anything unless it is necessary for his requirements. It is also said that some of the Jewish sellers and others who come from Manamah to Muharraq conceal bottles of liquor in the bundles of the piece-goods for sale at Muharraq. By this,the Municipality requests that if the law permits,the Government will allow them to carry their resolution into effect.
