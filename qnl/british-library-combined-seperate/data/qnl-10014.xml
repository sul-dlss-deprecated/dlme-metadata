Subsequently, the correspondence in the file discusses a request made by Shaikh Ahmad in 1948 to purchase another saluting cannon of the same type, a thousand rifles (with a million rounds of ammunition) and two hundred pistols (folios 42-95).The correspondence is primarily between the Political Agency in Kuwait and the Political Residency in Bushire, but the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence with Shaikh Ahmad (in Arabic accompanied by English translations).On folio 8, the file contains a simple, hand-drawn diagram of the base of a three-pounder saluting gun.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Weapons</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military ceremonies, honours, and salutes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000e0#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000e0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
