Sheil argues that the istishad nameh is valueless and that Hajee Mahomed Jaffer's letter is far from conclusive. Sheil goes on to describe his reservations about Hajee Mahomed Jaffer's letter, concerning the origins of a gold watch that was recently sold by the Agent. Sheil argues that it is an impossibility that the gold watch that Hajee Mahomed Jaffer bought from Moolla Mehdee could have been sold by the Agent to Meerza Abdul Baukee, as the watch was recognised by Her Majesty's Consul in Tehran, when brought to him for sale, as being the very peculiar gold watch that was purchased by Mr Tasker. The letter is followed by two extracts, written in Persian and taken from two letters from the Agent, Meerza Mahmood, to Sheil, dated 29 August and 2 December 1848 respectively.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000041#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
