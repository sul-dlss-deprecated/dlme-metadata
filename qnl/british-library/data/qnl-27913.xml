I have the honour to state that a formal representation has been received from the 'Uscat Government on the subject of telegraphic arrangements between Muscat and Gwadur. They request that the Pakistan Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department should Inform Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless Limited, Karachi, promptly when the Gwadur line is broken or restored. They complain that sometimes expensive cables take as long as three weeks on the way and arrive after letters conveyed by slow mail, and have asked that arrangements may kindly be made for the telegraph line to be kept in a better state of repair. 2. The Political Agent reports that the land line between Karachi and Gwadur broke down on the 5th June and was only put right on the 12th august and that it broke down again on the 14th August. 3. I should be most grateful if action could kindly be taken to ensure that the Karachi-Gwadur line is kept in a proper state of repair and that f,essrs. Cable &amp; tireless Limited are promptly informed of all breaches and their restoration. I am, Sir, Your Obedient Servant, (3GD). W.R. HaY. Political Resident.

Our postage rates frcan the Gulf to the outside world are, however, specified in the British Oommonwealth and foreign Post Warrant 191*3, which does not provide for an exceptional rate of postage for correspondence to Gwadur. In order to regularise the position we should like to increase the postage rates in farce from the other agencies to Gwadur to the rates normally operative from the agencies to Pakistan. Before so doing, however, I should be glad to learn whether you or Harrison (C»R.G») to whom I am sending a copy of this letter, have any ctojeeticn, as the increase, though trifling, might have political repercussions, especially at Muscat.

Rogers of your Eastern Department is dealing with the Foreign Office end of the retrocession proposal. Our own view is thfif until the retrocession question is settled, no useful purpose will be served in pressing the Pakistan Government further on the proposed changes in the Postal and Telegraph arrangements.

The Political Resident in the Persian Culf was instructed, in the light of the Pakistan Government's views, to discuss this matter further with the Sultan of Muscat, and has now reported tnat the Sultan has expressed a strong hope that the postal and telegraph arrangements will be taken over by Cable and Wireless Limited. It is understood that the Sultan is not altogether satisfied with the efficiency of the arrangements at present in force. 3. The Secretary of State understands that there would al&amp;e be some local technical advantage if Cable and Wireless were permitted to establish a wireless station at Cwadur in direct contact with Muscat, the capital of the State, thus enabling the present telegraph land line through Mekran, which is understood to be in a very bad condition, to be dispensed with. If this were agreed, it would seem desirable on ground of economy that Cable and Wireless should take over the running of Cwadur postal and telegraph communications as a whole. t 4* The Pakistan Government will perhaps now give the matter their further consideration in«23S£5Ll&amp;&amp;ix Pol.Jixt.l742C/if8 8th i«overaber, 1948« would you please refer to your letter ft©* W* 6611/95^/801 of 3rd November about post and telegraph arrangements at Gvadur. ^ I enclose a draft letter which we ^ propose to send to the High Coiiii Is Si oner for Pakistan# I should be grateful if you would let me Know by telephone if you concur, or if you have any amendments to suggest# lours sincerely. p A.

We wrote to the Resident, telling him of the Government of Pakistan’s approach to you and asked him for suggestions for the form our reply should take in view of our having previously asked Pakistan to undertake these services and our being now hard put to produce cogent reasons for asking them to retire in favour of Cable and Wireless. We pointed out that the isoue was a political one and that it seemed doubtful if the Sultan of Muscat would wish the Govern-nent of Pakistan to gain a permanent foothold in Gwadur. The Resident replied that the Sultan himself appeared to have no strong views, though he was not much impressed with the efficiency of the Gwadur post Office. With regard to our reply to Pakistan, the Resident was of the opinion that, as we could not use the only cogent reason for the proposal, the political one, we must fall back on the domestic one, that as His Majesty’s Government had taken over all the other post-offices in the Gulf States on behalf of their rulers, the Sultan would also want Gwadur included in the scheme. The Resident anticipated that Pakistan might make life difficult for Gwadur if this occurred but he felt that, if we agreed, he should put the question up to the Sultan /again i P.A.K.

They point out that the place is entirely surrounded by Pakistan territory, with which it has many commercial ties, and includes a number of Pakistani inhabitants. (A copy of their letter is enclosed). 3. We recognise the force of your objections to the continued operation by Pakistan of these services, and we doubt whether the Sultan of Muscat would wish the Pakistan postal administration to gain a permanent foothold in Gwadur. Cable and Wireless (as you will see from the enclosed copy of their letter to Harrison of the Commonwealth Relations Office) are willing to take over the services if we still wish them to do so; the decision is therefore entirely 6 political one. 4.

In your reply please quote Department, Reference. hoy The High Commissioner for Pakistan presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, and has the honour to refer to his express letter Ext. 807/48 dated .larch 30th, 1948. In paragraph three of the letter, enquiries were made as to whether the Government of Pakistan would be agreeable to Messrs. Cable and Wireless Ltd. , establishing a small 7/lreless Station at Gwadur, and taking over from the Pakistan Government the Posts and Telegraphs business there. The Government of Pakistan have given their careful consideration to the question, and have stated as follows: 'A year ago, prior to Partition, it was agreed that the United Kingdom Government should take over the administration of the Persian Gulf, including the run ning of the Posts and Telegraphs, and with the concurrence of the Government of India that the Pakistan Government should continue to administer the Posts and Telegraphs until the United Kingdom Government were in a position to take them over. The Government of Pakistan agreed to this arrangement for jeasons of territorial affinity and other allied considerations. ’’The United Kingdom Government subsequently proposed, in SECRO Express Letter No. Ext. 2215/47 dated October 16 th, 1947&gt; that the administration of the Posts and Telegraphs services in Gwadur should remain in the hands of the Government of Pakistan. We are ourselves disposed to agree with that proposal in view of the administrative considerations involved, and we feel that as Gwadur is on its lanl frontiers, entirely surrounded by what is now Pakistan, with which it has close trade and commercial /connectionsconnections, and contains among its inhabitants a large number of Pakistanis, any step that would loosen the links between G-wadur and the adjoining Pakistan territory, such as the handing over to Messrs. Cable and Wireless Ltd., of the Posts and Telegraphs system in Gwadur, which the Postal authorities in what is now Pakistan have run successfully for so long, would be regrettable. We are actuated also by considerations of security. 'The Government of Pakistan would accordingly be glad, if, for these reasons, the Government of the United Kingdom would agree to their continuing to run the Post and Telegraph services in Gwadur. In view of the circumstances pointed out in the Secretary of State’s letter o f October 16th. quoted, and particularly the opening portion of paragraph three, the Government of Pakistan trust that the Government of the United Kingdom would agree.' 4 London, 23rd June, 1948,CONflPKHTlAL PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY 1 I l- 1948 I I wss very glad to see from Commonwealtbr^elatlons Office Express Letter No. Ext .807/48 dated the 30th March that Cable and Wireless are willing to establish a small wireless station at Gwadur and to operate the postal business there. I hope it may be possible to persuade them to take over the Gwadur post and telegraph office at a very early date and in any case before the 30th September next. During my recent visit to Gwadur I was informed that no repairs had been carried out to the post office building for 7 years and that it will soon collapse unless some thing is done. The building is quite a good one and used to belong to the Indi-European Telegraph Department and if Cable and Wireless want some suitable base from which to operate the sooner they take it over and repair it the better. Another point is that it seems likely that if the Pakistan Administration continue to run the post office after the 30th September next they will insist that only Pakistan currency should be used by it which is likely to lead to complications c.f. my letter No.1031-93/6 dated the 13th April, 1948 Sd/- W.R.

Telegrams are sent to Panjgur by a land-line which is frequently interrupted. Should there be any deterioration in the administration of Mekran, which is, I think, not improbable, both the mail and telegraph services might be suspended indefinitely. Fr©m the general political aspect, especially In view of the Khan of Kalat's claim to Gwadur, it is, in my opinion, undesirable tnat we should continue to depend upon the Pakistan Government and the Kalat State administration for the maintenance of post and telegraph services at Gwadur. I understand from Appelby that the Pakistan authorities themselves would be glad t© be relieved of their responsibility. I therefore strongly recommend that if possible Cable and Wireless should establish a small wireless station at Gwadur for communication with Muscat only and that as suggested by Appelby the manager of^the station should run a Post Office as a sub-office ci the Muscat Post Office. Mails should be carried by sea. In view of the fact that mail steamers call at Gwadur in both directions once every two or three weeks, the service should be alaost as frequent as the present one. 6* ^ The manager* of Cable and Wireless at Muscat informed me that it should be possible to run the proposed wireless station quite cheaply with one engineer who could be relieved every six months from Muscat. There is accommodation available for him either in the Post Office itself or in the Rest House which is presumably what is described as an inspection bungalow in paragraph IV of the enclosure to Low's letter No.F.15-BPG/47 dated the 7th June, 1947. 7_ If we do not take over the land-line the cost of the buildings etc. we shall have to acquire is not very large, c.f. the note referred to above, and I see no reason Why the combined wireless station and post office should not be run at a krefit. ^otewart has informed me that the value of the telegraph traffic for the last six months is Rs.54,017. v,, b V I _ should be grateful if the proposals contained in this letter could be given early consideration. It is desirable to let the Pakistan authorities know whether we wish them to administer the Gwadur Post and Telegraph Office indefinitely or if not when we shall be ready to take it over. E.P. Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., Coramonweilth Relations Office Downing Street, LONDON, S.W.l 'LB*4J The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. y G£ADUR 1 was net able to visit Gwadur on my return visit to Karachi as the boat did not stay long enough at the port, but I discussed the position iully when Major Stewart at Muscat and also with his agent at Gwadur (the latter ooarded th^ boat for about half an hour during her stay at the port). As a result, I formed the opinion that it would be mest undesirable to worsen the existing postal or telegraphic facilities. The port has very poor communication, ships rarely call, and mails are conveyed by camel once a fortnight to Delhi via Quetta, taking a minimum of 13 days in transmission. No air service a is available. The existing telegraph line, Gwadur Panjgur appears to be in bad condition, but it is very essential t® the native population (about 10 - 12,000) for trading purposes. They deal mainly in the export of fish, and I am advised that the cutting off of telegraph facilities would strangle trade and possibly result in the evacuation of the inhabitants tc Karachi, ihe inhabitants have been pressing for a long time past for better communication facilities and there is no tioubt that there would be a great uproar if the present poor facilities were worsened. Your suggestion that Cable and Vvireless should be approached with the view of setting up a small wireless station at Gwadur for communication with Muscat and/or India and at the same time run the Post Office as a sub office of Muscat, would give a solution to the problem, and 1 am representing the matter to my Headquarter* 'accordingly to see whether ti will be possible tc take any action tc this end. You will be advised of any developments as early as possible. •I have also since discussed the matter with Col.Spear, Director-General, Posta and Telegraphs, Pakistan, and he advises that the Pakistan Administration will be prepared to continue the present postal and telegraph arrangements at Gwadur until such time as a decision has been reached. He expressed the view, h©wev however, that so long as the Pakistan Administration runs the post. *nd telegraph services at Gwadur, no change should be made in the existing services, conditions and postage rates, etc., ie. Gv/adur should be regarded during this period as part of Pakistan for postal and telegraph purposes .A° Telephone: HEADQUARTERS 1234 Telegramsj^Postgen Cent London Your Rete. ^..ice Ext 1^1 2/fflDEXEQ P.O.

Political Agency, Muscat. 19th October 1947 Dear Sir Rupert, Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with Colonel Galloway*s telegram No.991 dated the 16th September 1947 on the subject of postal arrange ments at Gwadur. 2. In arriving at the conclusion that the Pakistan Government should be asked to continue the existing postal arrangements at Gwadur, primary considera tion appears to have been given to the financial aspect of the question. The political aspect is, hov/ever, of perhaps greater importance and while I imagine it must have been given greater consideration than appears from the correspondence which has been forwarded to me, in order to be sure that this side of the question has not been overlooked, I should be grateful if you would confirm that you do not desire me to take it up as a separate issue. s 3. Even from the financial aspect I am not altogether satisfied that we are correct in suggesting that to take over the Post and Telegraph Office at Gwadur would be a financial liability. It seems to me that Gwadur should definitely be regarded as a Sub Post Office of Muscat and as such, its figures of profit and loss should be read together with the profit and loss account of the Muscat Post Office. If this is done I think it can be readily assumed that the over-all profit would be sufficient^/ to give a very reasonable return on any capital expenditure to which the General Post Office may be put in establishing a small wireless installation at Gwadur which could communicate through Muscat with the outside world. Viewed purely from the point of view of communications and the convenience of the inhabitants, a small wireless station would certainly be preferable to the present unreliable land telegraph line which could then be dispensed with without any obligation on the part of the General Post Office to accept financial responsibility for Indian Posts and Telegraph Department*s assets other than perhaps the actual buildings.

As the postal traffic is so small I think practical objections, if aiy,arising out of the use of Pakistan practice, charges and stamps at Gwadur, and British at Muscat,could perhaps be resolved at discussions between Mr* Appleby and the local people* We/ F«A*K* Harrison Esq«- We are still of course awaiting word from you before proceeding to issue 'Muscat' stamps, which I understand will cover Muscat itself in any case and Gwadur also if we take over there.

Bated the 14th August 1947 Reference your Express Letter No. Ext. 47^ // dated 29th July 1947. FUTURE OF TELEGRAPH ARRANGEMENTS AT GW AD UR. 2. Gwadur is at present maintained by the Indian Post and Telegraphs Department as a combined post and telegraph office. Its monthly income and expenditure as shown in enclosure IV of Low’s letter No.F. 15-BPG/47, dated the 7th July 1947 to Donaldson is approximately Rs 1252 and Ss 392 respectively. This does not include the proportionate cost of the carriage of sea mail nor the cost of maintenance of the Gwadur-Panjgur line viz. fis 625 per month. Even taking these two items into account it is probable that the office at present pays its way. \ 3. To take over only the post office at Gwadur would be uneconomical. To take over the telegraph office as well would involve the payment of heavy charges for the Indian Post and Telegraphs Department’s assets, vide enclosure to Low’s letter quoted above. The installation of even a small wireless station communicating only with Muscat would cost an appreciable sum and the pay of an operator would be much more than that of a signaller of. the Post and Telegraphs Department. It would also involve the wasteful scrapping of the present land line to Panjgur. 4. From the political point of view it would be preferable if Gwadur could be brought under the same postal administration as that of Muscat. I do not consider, however, that there is sufficient justification for achiev ing this at the financial loss that would be likely to result. I recommend therefore that, subject to the consent of the Sultan of Muscat, the Government of Pakistan should be asked to continue the existing postal and telegraph arrangements at Gwadur. Sd. A.
