Anderson requests that Jones explain why he surrendered the two slaves, who had been imported from Zanzibar during the current season, adding that it is the opinion of his Lordship in Council that if British protection had been extended to the two slaves, they should not have been returned to slavery. The two enclosures are as follows:1.

                           Victoriato Bombay, with a description of their poor health; the incident in which two slaves at Bandar-e Lengeh requested British protection, but were deemed to have been seized illegally by the British Agent, and who have been handed back to the Bandar-e Lengeh authorities at the request of the Resident; the reaction of the female slave, having learnt that she was to be returned to the Persian authorities, instead of being sent to Bombay with the other slaves;2.
