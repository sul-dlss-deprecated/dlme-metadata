Maps and Illustrations. By Post 21s. 6d. net. T HIS book, written by one of the greatest living authorities on Arabia and the Arabs, tells the life story of a people who have left their deep impress on mankind. It is not a dry-as-dust history, but a live, lucid and authoritative biography full of the most varied interest. * After describing the life and teaching of the Prophet Mo hammed Mr. Thomas turns to unravel briefly the marvellous wars of expansion by which the Arabs swept the world in our Dark Ages and planted their faith and dominion from India to Spain. Then come foreign invaders—Crusaders from Europe, Mongols from Asia—to buffet the Arabs, bring them low, and make them an easy prey for the conquering Turk. And so Mr. Thomas brings us down the ages to the Great War, and concludes with an estimate of where and for what the Arabs stand to-day. Amidst this history a most interesting description is given of the social life of Arabia, of the Arts and the Sciences which made Arab civilisation the most eminent in the world. Thus, in this single volume, we have all the varied interests of religion, wars, arts, sciences, and politics of a people who have played no mean part in the history of the world. Mr. Bertram Thomas enjoys the distinction of being the only white man to have served as Prime Minister of an independent Arab State and the first white man to have crossed the great South Arabian desert— a journey which Lawrence described as the finest thing in Arabian exploration. He had the honour of being summoned to Buckingham Palace to recount his experiences to King George V, and invited to the House of Commons to address its members. Mr. Bertram Thomas has written a great book which will undoubtedly for long maintain its position as the classic of Arabian history.Published by Thornton Butterworth Ltd. 15 Bedford Street W.C. 2 THE ARABS by BERTRAM THOMAS Author of 'Arabia Felix' Large Demy &amp;vo.

L♦ Annual Report on the Working of the Mayo College, Ajmer, for 1936-37. «cOOOo» ■' ' 1. Management. —The General Council held two meetings during the year General Council, under rejxjrt viz. on 28th November 1936 and 20th April 1937. At the first meeting His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur and His Highness the Maharaja of Jaipur were unanimously re-elected President anl Vice-President respectively of the Council for the coming year with effect from August 26th, 1937. The meeting also decided to widen the membership of the Council, by increasing the number of Ruling Princes outside Rajputana who are eligible for ao-option under rule 1 (IV) from 4 to 6 and the representatives of the Old Boys’ Association from 3 to 4 . At the same meeting in accordance with the constitution His Highness the Maharaj Rana of Dholpur, His Highness the Maharaja of Jaipur, His Highness the Maharawat of Partabgarh, and His Highness the Maharawal of Duagarpur were elected members of the Working Committee for the next 3 years with effect from 26th August 1937. The Principal was re-appointed Secretary of the Council and of the Working Committee for 4 years with effect from August 26th 1937. The working Committee met twice, on 3rd October 1936 and on 20th Working Committee. If March 1937. At the latter meeting His Highness the Maharaj Rana of Dholpur was unanimously re-elected Chairman of the Committee for the next three years. On the recommendation of the Committee accepted by the General Council at their second meeting the membership of the Committee in future will consist I' W of one more Ruling Prince of Rajputana and one more representative of the Old V' Boys’ Association making a total membership of 8 , but the quorum necessary for meetings will remain at the former figure of 4. This new arrangement should make it easier to obtain a quorum for meetings and so obviate the inconvenience occasioned in recent years by the postponement or cancellation of meetings. In accordance with the above the Maharana of Danta was elected a member of the Committee for the next 3 years with effect from August 26th 1937, and Raj Chandra Sen of Kunadi and Rao Bahadur Thakur Onkar Singh of Bagsuri were elected to the Committee as representatives of the Old Bovs’ Association. J Extracts from the proceedings of the Council and Committee meetings, other than those mentioned in the main body of the report will be found in Appendix A.Renewal of Bikaner grant for Post Diploma classes. Jaipur House Exten sion. Staff and Old Boys Club. 2 2 . Finance.—Details of Receipts and Expenditure of the various funds are given in Appendix B. The following is a condensed statement:— Rs. R s . Total income 2,28,300 Deduct —Abnormal non-recurring receipts ... 35,787 Normal income ... ... ... 1,92,513 Add— Normal income not realized:— Cut in Government grant ... ... 4,950 ^ Arrears of fees for 1936-37 ... 4,000 8,950 Nett normal income Total expenditure Deduct —Abnormal non-recurring expenditure ••• * 2,01,463 ... 2,40,542 ... 54,055 Nett normal expenditure... ... 1,86,487 Surplus of nett normal income over nett normal expenditure. ... ... 14.976 In view of the fact that by affiliation to the Agra University the College had attained the status of a Degree College, the Bikaner Durbar were good enough to renew their annual grant cf Rs. 4,000/- to the College Post Diploma Section which had been discontinued from 1925 to 1936, and this errant will cover the additional expenditure required on the staff by the change in status of the Post Diploma section. 3. Buildings—The College Public Works Department is now respon sible for the maintenance not only of the buildings in the College belonging to the College but also of those belonging to the States and to Government. The last named, being part of the original Endowment Grant by the Government of India on the founding of the College, have been handed over to the College free of rent. In my previous report reference was made to the proposed extension to the Jaipur Boarding House, In the year under report a revised scheme for additions and alterations to be completed by instalments was approved by His Highness and the work will be carried out by the State Public Works Department. The scheme provides for the construction of a new wing facing the west wing Mj of the House and for remodelling the old portion of the House to provide a dining hall, common study room, a dormitory for junior boys, changing rooms, and Motamid’s quarters. The new wing is to be taken in hand first and it is hoped that it will be ready for occupation next term. It will afford a most welcome and badly needed relief to the present congestion in the House. At the beginning of the school year a Staff and Old Boys’ Club, which, at the instance of the members of the Staff, was named the Stow Club, was started. Premises were provided by the adaptation and extension of the for mer P. W. D. office and godown near the Main building. The accommodation in the Club comprises a sitting room, a card room, a billiards room, a changing room, an office, and a kitchen. The facilities for outdoor games include 2 tennis courts, a bowling green, and a badminton court. The membership of the club is open to all superior members of the College Staff and to Old BoysThe latter can join either as temporary or as life members. The institution of the Club was made possible by a number of initial donations from Ruling Princes including :—His Highness the Maharana of Udaipur, His Highness the Maha raja of Jodhpur, His Highness the Maharao Raja of Bundi, His High- jiess the Nawab of Tonk, His Highness the Maharaj Rana of Dholpur, His Highness the Maharawal of Dungarpur, and His Highness the Maharawat of Partabgarh. ^ The Ruling Chief of Khairgarh E. S. A. an Old Boy of the ( ollege, generously presented a Billiards Table and K. Kamakshya Narain Singh of Ramgarh, another Old Boy, gave a Wireless Set. The permanent membership of the club, which has made a most encourag ing start, is at present 60 apart from Patrons and Life members ; and the club forms a welcome bond of union and a common meeting place for all members of the Staff and many Old Boys. The scheme for providing houses in the College grounds for Indian members of the Staff, to which reference was made in my last report, was approved by the General Council at their meeting of November 1936 and construction is in course of progress. Eight houses are being built and four of them are expected to be ready early next term. In addition to the advantages both to the College and the blasters of a residential staff system the scheme will be a permanent form of investment for the College from the rentals payable. . With the institution of the Staff Club the Staff Common Room was removed from the former P. W. D. office to the adjoining godown part of which was extended and rebuilt for the purposes. The Carpentry and Motor Instruction rooms hitherto located in the P.W .D. godown were shifted to the godown adjoining the Bikaner Pavilion which was adapted for the purpose. * 4 . Roads and Grounds—During the year the hitherto remaining untarred portions of the main roads of the College including those passing the Main building were tarred. Additional grass was planted round the Main building and this together with the planting of shrubs and the laying down of gravel on ^he north front has appreciably improved the appearance of the building. During the rains a considerable amount of new hedge planting was done hut the growth of hedges has been handicapped by the scanty rainfall. The plot of land recently acquired on the south side of the College bound- arv was fenced in, while the land outside the regular boundary immediately surrounding the old Temple being no longer wanted was sold. During the Summer vacation a pavilion was constructed on the new second NI Cricket ground which had been made on the site of the former Ridino- ground and called the St, John ground after the first Principal of the College. This ground has been turfed. North of this two new Foot-ball grounds were made, and the College has now 6 Cricket grounds, 3 of which are grass, 4 grass Football grounds, and 4 Hockey grounds.

During the year a number of House gardens were re-designed and relaid, resulting in a general improvement. The Lady Willingdon Cup was won by Udaipur House, Jaipur House being second. 5. Special Donations.— It will be seen from the preceding paragraphs that the Collect has again been fortunate in gifts during the year. ^ 9 The College is also indebted for a number of other donations for special purposes. His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur continued his generosity to the College by presenting Rs. 4,000/- for an electric water installation for the College Polo ground. This gift will give the College a first-class grass ground which can be used throughout the year. His Highness also presented a Morris Car for instructional purposes in place of the Sunbeam car formerly presented by him and now worn out. His Highness the Maharaja of Jaipur made a donation of Rs. 1,000/- towards the equipment of the new Temple. This gift has enabled the hall of the Temple to be provided with screens in the arches to keep out wind and rain and with suitable durries. The Maharana of Danta made a donation for the College Section Library which has provided the Library with a number of badly wanted books of reference. His Highness the Maharaja of Panna, as a leaving gift in the name of his two sons who left the College in 1936, made a donation for converting the somewhat unsightly stand on the 1 st XI Hockey ground into a suitable pavilion. In addition to the above the Bundi, Bikaner, Alwar, and Tonk Durbars were good enough to make special donations for further improving the Boarding Houses. O The warm thanks of the College are due to the above for their generosity. 6 . Staff- Colleg-e Section.—The College section Staff now comprised 9 5 whole-time lecturers in addition to the Principal, which is the minimum necessary in view of the affiliation of the College Section classes to the Rajputana Intermediate Board and to the Agra University. The work of the regular staff received a valuable supplement from the assistance volunteered by Mr. Waddington. School Section.— In October Rai Sahib Pt. Shyam Sunder Sharma, Senior Indian Assistant, retired after a long and honourable connection with the College; and Mr. A. Wahid, Second Indian Assistant, was selected by the Working Committee to succeed him as Senior Assistant. The vacancy on the permanent staff occasioned by the retirement of R. S. Pt. Shyam Sunder Sharma was subsequently filled by the confirmation in a junior grade of Mr. A. Sharman m.a., who had been acting as temporary Assistant Master. In view of the increase in the College Roll and the need to form additional classes the Indian staff was temporarily increased by two additional blasters.Messrs. Bhatia and Kapur, who had been on deputation for training during the previous year, returned to the College from Lahore and England respectively having passed their examinations with credit. On their return the policy of sending junior members of tbe staff for training was continued by the deputation of Mr. Dan Mai to the Trainino- Colleo’e at Lahore. Thakur Shivnath Singh of Kanota, an Old Boy of Ihe College succeeded Thakur Sawai Singh as Motamid of the Jaipur House in November. w During the year Mr. C. W. Waddington, C.I.E., M.v.o., returned to the College as Guardian to the Maharai Kumars of Jodhpur and Major G. S. Jarman joined the College as Guardian to K. K. Hardayal Singh of Sikar. Ihe number of English Guardians is at present o and it is a^ain my pleasant duty to express my thanks to them for the assistance thev have been good enough to give in the various activities of the College. 7. The Colleg-e Roll.—During the year the College roll rose from 152 to 159. Admissions numbered 36 of whom 25 came from Rajputana and 11 outside Rajputana. Of tbe former 11 came from Jaipur state, and 4 from Jodhpur state, tbe rest being contributed by Bharatpur, Alwar, Kotah, Bikaner and Danta States and Ajmer-Merwara. The admissions from outside Rajputana comprised boys from tbe Punjab, Central India, The Eastern States Agency, The Western India States Agency, and Bengal. A distribution list of the College Roll as it stands at present will be found in Appendix E. 8 General Training—The practice of Holiday tours started in tbe previous year for students of tbe College section was continued by a successful tour during the Christmas holidays to Northern India. It was hoped to extend the practice to boys in the School section by arranging tours during the Summer vacation; but the response, largely owing to the season of the rear, was not sufficient to justify any tour being undertaken. I much hope to be able to arrange tours of boys of the School section in the next cold weather, which is a more suitable season. An interesting extension of the activities of the Colleo-e section was C? o the starting of Social service to the poor and a number of students paid visits 'to villages in the neighbourhood of Ajmer to assist the villagers in anv wav thev could. J J In the College Section Debates were included as a regular feature of the class time-table, while in the School section they were held outside the school periods. In the School section the reading habit, I am glad to say, has continued to grow and over 2,000 books were taken out of the School library during the year apart from books taken from Class libraries. Living as they do in a number of small scattered Boarding Houses, largely composed of boys from the same State, boys in the School section of the College tend to be split up into small self-centred local groups with little opportunity of meeting together apart from school and games. For this reason a few' years ago I started Social Intercourse periods on Sundays Deputation of Masters on trainingr- Boarding House Staff. English Guardians. Tours. Social Service. Debates. Libraries. Inter-House Hospitality.Careers Advisory Bureau. School Period. Examinations. Riding. and Holidays at which boys could meet together irrespective of their Houses and for this as well as for other reasons Evening entertainments. The idea has been carried further in the year under report by the encouragement of Inter- House hospitality, boys of one House with the approval of their House Master being allowed to ask boys from other Houses to dinner or to tea and to play games on Sundays and Holidays. The problem of finding suitable careers for such Mayo College boys as have to make their own way in the world or have no suitable appointment waiting for them in their homes is increasing in importance with new^ conditions in India, and arrangements have therefore been made to start a Careers Advisory Bureau which will assist boys to choose a career. 9 . Class Instruction.—College Section —In the College Section im provements were made in the Jhalawar House by extending the library and by equipping the lecture rooms according to subjects taught, also by providing all lecture rooms and tutorial rooms with wire-gauze doors. School Section. —In the School section the class rooms were re decorated with suitable pictures obtained from England and the facilities for instruction in Geography were increased by a special library in the Geography room and by extending the Open Air Map of India. The junior classes now contain a large number of young boys some of whom are almost at the kindergarten stage. I welcome boys joining at a young age because experience has convinced me that the younger a boy joins the better he does. But these boys require special methods of instruction, and I am inclined to think that it will be advisable to appoint a trained Lady teacher for the junior classes. The number of daily class periods for senior classes remains at 7 periods of 40 minutes each, but in the junior classes in the interests of boys’ health and to avoid over-strain they have been curtailed. Junior boys are required to rest for certain periods during the afternoon and most of the junior boys do not have afternoon school at all. 2 Candidates appeared in April for the Intermediate Examination of the Rajputana Board, 8 for the Higher Diploma Examination, and 15 for the Diploma Examination. Of the 8 candidates in the Higher Diploma, 4 passed in second class and 1 in third class while of the 15 candidates in the Diploma, 14 came out successful. Of the 14 successful candidates 8 passed in the second division and 6 in the third division while 10 candidates secured distinctions in^ Hindi, Science, Administration and Persian. The result of the Intermediate Examination has not yet been received. 10. Physical Training and Games.— The College Squadron has had a satisfactory year under the leadership of Maharaj Kumar Pramod Singh of Rajpipla, who has done very good -work, and his departure will leave a gap that will not be easy to fill. It is a great pity there are no riders from the Bikaner, Kotah, and Took Houses. During the Monsoon term when Col. Howson was on leave general arrangements were under the control of Major Hannay and the sincere thanks of the College are due to him and also to Captain Beatty and Major Jarman for their most ready assistance throughout the year. Col. Howson has been*in charge since his return from leave in October. oA special jumping course for the Junior Division has been constructed. This has done much to raise the standard of the Lower Division. Dafedar Bhanwar Singh, Jaipur Lancers has done good work through out the year as Instructor. The arrival of the Maharajkumars of Jodhpur with Maharaj Ilanumant Singh has compensated for the departure of Maharaj Kumar Narendra Singh and Maharaj Kumar Pushpendra Singh of Panna. There are now 15 boys playing regularly in station Polo and 6 others who practise with great enthusiasm on the College ground on Sundays and Holidays. Among these are several who show real promise. For the tirst time it has been possible to raise teams from the House Divisions to compete for the Dhonkal Cup. The result of the matches was— North defeated West by 8 goals to 1 . South defeated West by 4 goals to 2 North defeated South by 4 goals to 2. An innovation during the year was the institution of a triangular con test at all games between the Staff, the College section, and the School section. The Staff won both their matches at Cricket and Tennis, the Colleo;e section were similarly successful at Squash, the School section had an ensy victory in the Sports, and a close win in the Swimming, while the Football resulted in honours easy. The College Cricket XI again won the Colvin Shield for the third year in succession defeating the Tonk XI in the final after a close game. In the Inter-Provincial Championship for the Banji Trophy the College was well represented in the Rajputana team, which played against and was beaten by Central India after securing a substantial lead in the first innings, supplying 4 of the XL The Annual Tournament of the School section teams with the Daly College for the Kishangarh Shield was due this year to be played at Ajmer in February, but it had, 1 regret, first to be postponed and then cancelled owing to an outbreak of mumps at the College, which though limited to a few cases ^was persistent. The Annual Inter-House Athletic Sports held in March produced a crop of records. Kan war Hari Sen of Pisangan beat the previous record for the Long Jump with a jump of 20 ft. inches, and that of the 100 vards by returning a time of 10 seconds, and equalled the 120 yards Hurdles record of I5f seconds and his own record of the previous year of 5 ft. 0 inches for the High Jump, while Thakur Manohar Singh of Dhamli (Jodhpur) beat the Half Mile record with a time of 2 mts- 15 seconds. 11 11 . Important events—The Annual Prize-Giving and Old Boys’ Gathering, a full account of which appeared in the December issue of the Mayo College Magazine, took place on November 28th, 1936. The President of the General Council of the College, His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur, pre sided at the Prize-Giving which was attended by 4 other Ruling Princes and there was a satisfactorv attendance of other Old Boys.

I also wish to express the great indebtedness of the College and myself to the President and Vice-President of the General Council and the Chairman and ivembers of the Working Committee for the unfailing and generous support which they have extended to its interests.

INSPECTION REPORT 1937. We inspected this College on February 25th, 26th and 27th, which wasa half holiday. ^ We were concerned chiefly with the organization and teaching work done in the school section of the institution. We visited also, however, the Intermediate Classes which have been recently recognised by the Board of Hioh School and Intermediate Education for Rajputana, Central India and Gwalior. The College is also affiliated to the Agra University for the B.A. deoree. Lt. Col. G. L. Betham, C. I. E., M. C., in his capacity as political officer, was associated with the inspection. We would like to express our thanks to Mr. V. A. S. Stow, C. L E., the Principal and the staff for the willing help given to us during: our visit. It is a pleasure to go over the extensive grounds of the college which have been w T ell laid out and are beautifully kept. The class rooms are well furnished and suitable in size for present numbers. A pleasing feature we noted was the number of good pictures about the place. Throughout there is an atmosphere of good taste which must make a lasting impression on all the students. Enrolment and range of ages in the different classes :— C/ass. College Section : Enrolment.

In many of the best Indian High Schools it does not rise above 75%. The system of promotion on probation is, as a rule, unsatisfactory. It should be possible, after full consideration of the pupil’s work throughout the year, to come to a definte conclusion as to his fitness for a higher class. School Section: On whole school days the daily time table, the hours of which vary according to the season of the year, is as follow's : — A % Morning Parade Bath and Sandhya Morning preparation Breakfast Classes (40 Minutes periods) ...

The periods have also been changed as suggested from six at 45 minutes to seven at 40 minutes. It will be a good thing if masters in charge of subjects could arrange to exchange class with other masters taking the subjects throughout the school. They would thus be better able to co-ordinate what is being done in the various classes. As regards the actual teaching, it was on the whole of a very fair standard but we notice in some classes a tendency to lecture rather than to teach, and throughout the school^ too little use is being made of the blackboard. Ihe duller boys Should always be placed in front. An adequate Preparation Scheme has been drawn up, the maximum time allotted being 2 hours in the higher classes and hours in the low T er. There is some improvement in the coaching of English but the new syllabus requires still further amplitication and the way in which this can pro- titablv be done has been discussed with the various masters teaching the subject. The Principal, by means of the progress report books, will be able to see that the work is being properly carried out. What is particularly wanted is regular drill in such matters as common errors, conditional sentences and the like In some classes we w ere inclined to think that too much time has to be spent on boys who were not really fit for the class they were in. In the upper classes a phrase book, written by one of the staff, was being used but this should be done with the greatest care. Where there is so much ground to cover, it is doubtful whether the time s]&gt;ent on going straight through this book is worth while. At this stage what the pupils meet within their text books should be sufficient. We are not sure that it is necessary, especially in the higher classes, to spend so much time in dictation. The value of this exercise is not primarily a test of spelling but it is “ a test of the pupil’s progress in hearing the spoken language ”. Spelling is letter dealt w r ith by some form of drill, social care being taken to group together similar and contrasted words. Before giving a dictation exercise it is advisable to let the boys study the difficult words beforehand so as to o;et a clear imao;e of the words. We are o-lad to see that script writing has been introduced ; this should, in time, bring about a distinct improvement in neatness and hand-w’riting. Meanwhile care should be taken to see that smaller boys are not using unsuitable nibs, as many ar(^ at present. Spoken English is good but in reading many boys read in a some what unnatural and stilted w f ay. Special care should be taken to see that emphasis is rightly placed. In the lower classes during conversation answers should lx? in complete sentences and boys should be encouraged to question one another. Some good work has been done in the way of dramatization ; w r e should like to see this extended to some of the upper classes. • In the Diploma Class more precis and unseen work w'ould undoubtedly lead to a better comprehension of the written word. Composition in some classes was weak ; some of the exercises inspected were rather feeble in ideas. We think that not sufficient is being done in preparation for such written exercises. The drawing up of outlines by the co-operative efforts of the class should not be dropped too soon. Boys should make better preparation by searching in lxx)ks to be suggested by the teacher, if necessary, for information on the subject on which they have to write. Many teachers have found the followino; books useful:—29 should be seen not only by the librarian but also by the masters teaching English and Vernacular. Attention is being paid to getting a good supply of books in Vernacular. Tdiese as well as those on various kinds of sports seem to be particularly popular. More children’s books are also being added. # o d here is a considerable number of books in the library which are never taken out by anybody. One hesitates, however, to suggest that they should be eliminated, as many of them are standard works. ^ A good start has been made with the Masters’ library but no issue register is maintained. We were glad to learn that the Librarian had under gone a course of training. There are 25 members on the staff excluding the staff of the college staff, ~ a department but including 5 honorary members. The increase in enrolment has necessitated the addition of two extra masters. Three members of the staff have been trained and one is undergoing training. Most of those who have not been trained have, however, good academical qualifications and ex- perience. The school consists of eight classes, the lowest three being eacli divided Organisation, into two sections, which form for all practical purposes, separate classes. The bifurcation has been made so that these classes will not be too large and also to provide for the weaker boys. The B section is the lower of the two. A boy entering the school in the lowest class should ordinarily complete the course in eight or nine years. The work in the upper classes is in accordance with the requirements for the Diploma Examination. The subjects for which the boys are prepared for this examination are:— English, which includes a paper in General Knowledge, Arithmetic, History, Geography, Science or a Classical Language, Advanced Mathematics or Law Administration and a Vernacular. Drawing is included in the scheme of studies up to class V, while one period a week is provided in the time table for classes up to class III for Special Activities as follows:— Ill Class Miniature Range, Fretwork, Scientific Experi ments. IV Class ... Miniature Range, Carpentry, Motoring. V Class ... First Aid. VIA&amp;B ... Fretwork, Carpentry, Gardening, Cycle Repairs. VII A &amp; B ... Fretwork, Carpentry, Gardening, Cycle Repairs. VIII A &amp; B ... Fretwork, Gardening. another car has just been presented to the College, it might he possible to continue the study of motoring in Class III as well. We consider that very useful work is being done in these periods, but we feel that the value of the training would be enhanced if more guidance and incidental instruction could be given. The boys in the carpentry class should, for instance, know the names of the tools and the wood the\ u^e.28 Class VII A and B Class VIII A and B f 1-55—2-35 P. M. (on Mondays ^ only).

On Sundays and holidays, games are voluntary but boys must be out in the open air in the morning and evening; also on Thursday afternoon, games are voluntary hut boys have to be out in the open. On Sundays and holidays, there is a Temple service for 1 hour at 9-45 and Social Intercourse periods in the main building—Seniors | 1 hour Juniors \ each. There is no preparation on Saturday evenings and on evenings before holidays and entertainments are arranged on those eveninofs in the Colleo;e. Boys not detained for bad work or conduct are allowed to go to the Cinema in the City. The number of books taken out from the library (including those by the staff) was :— 1934-35 ... 932 1935- 36 ... 1,720 1936- 37 ... 1,438 (up to 15th of February 1937). The figure should be nearly 2,000 by the end of this school year. (The above figures do not include books issued from the various class libraries). It is gratifying to note that more books are being taken out. The boys, however, in the diploma class seem to read practically nothing excepting their text books. The librarian has introduced a form of notebook in which boys are sup}K)sed to write short analyses of the books they have read. This is an excellent idea but should be carried to its logical conclusion, i.e. these criticisms O 181 t * “ En g lish Composition ’ by A. Tiunbull (W. R. Chambers). “ Thought in English Prose by A. J. Cole (Heineman). Work in Geography requires little comment as the teaching was good thiou^hout. I he boys were interested in what they were doing and could answer intelligently most of the questions put to them. Map work was i le ju te and as a mle confined to essentials but there was a tendency in some classes to spend too much time on this. Sketch maps only are wanted. The open air map which has been again improved is an excellent feature and was well understood by the boys using it. We would suggest that the Memorandum on the Teaching Geography (George Philip &amp; Son) should be purchased for teachers’ use as it covers the whole ground in the most up-to-date way Instruction in Sanskrit was being carried out on somewhat old-fashioned lines but the boys had made good progress. More written composition work should be done and there should be regular drill in Grammar. The teaching in \ ernacular showed a distinct improvement. More interesting subjects, might in the higher classes, be chosen for essay work. Teaching in History was also on the right lines. In this subject constant revision is necessary ; it is also desirable for the boys to know the most impor tant dates. As we have remarked in connection with the Daly College, the English History course is far too long and there is nothing pedagogically unsound in beginning with Henry the VII or even later. As it is, there is far too much ground to be covered in the time available. If a new syllabus is to be prepared, it may be well to indicate in it in some detail those aspects of English History which will be subjects for examination. The possibility of giving more time for written exercises in History and Geography might be examined. Both subjects afford ample scope for narrative writing and logical reasoning. Their educational value is not fully utilised if these are neglected. Such exercises help to crystallise knowledge gained by oral instruction. It is also a help in training boys in written expression. The teachers of History and Geography will find the V. I. S. Filmslide Projector useful. Nature Study used to be taught but it has now been left out of the scheme of work. Science is taken as an optional subject, alternative to Sanskrit or Persian, for the Diploma Examination. This means that a boy may leave the college without any knowledge of Science whatsoever, a subject which is now regarded as an integral part of the general education of bovs. We suggest that the question of re-introducing N ature Study or rather a General Science course on broad humanistic lines should be considered. Such a course would also provide a foundation for the study of the specific sciences later. The boys had a fairly good grasp of the important points studied but their acquaintance with Science is too academic. We would like to see more attention being given to the study of the applications of scientific principles met with in every day life. The study of Chemistry is confined to the second and fourth years of the course. We think it would be an advantage if the study of both Physics and Chemistry could be taken up together in each year and the exercises in measurements of lengths and area etc., transferred to the Arithmetic lesson. The proposal to encourage boys to purchase scientific constructional outfits is an excellent one. Greater facilities might be provided for boys who obtain these outfits and others who wish to make models andthe beauties of nature around them. If possible, the best of the boys might be introduced to outdoor work. The teacher may find some useful suggestions in the following books:— “Teaching Creative Art in School” by R. &amp; A. Eccott (Evan Bros.). “Teachers Manual of Drawing” by Weston (Nelson.) “Studies in the Appreciation of Art” by Bolls &amp; Happenstail (Wheaton &amp; Co.,) Teachers of English will find this book interesting. o Diploma Examination.

Every ^tiling possible is done to stimulate healthy interests and the tone and discipline of the College are in consequence most satisfactoy. (Sd.) F. K. CLARK, Principal, Spence 7 raining College, Jubbulpore. (Sd.) W. G. P. WALL, Principal, Government Training College, Allahabad.34 Report by Lt.-Col. G. L Betbam, n).C., Resident in tDeinar and Political il^ent, Southern Rajputana States. I was associated with Mr. F. K. Clark and Mr. W. G. P. Wall in their inspection of Mayo College on February 25th) 26th, and 2/th, 1937. through out the inspection our ways lay mostly apart for whereas their’s was an inspection of the teaching and organisation mine was of a less technical nature. My work was much facilitated by my personal knowledge of the members of 0 s flie staff and of many of the boys during the last four years, and by statistical and other information given me by Mr. V. A. S. Stow, c.i.e., m.a., Principal. Before breakfast on February 25th I went round the grounds where I saw some of the boys occupied at nets, at tennis and running. I understand that this is varied with riding and foot drill which occupy most of the boys. Specially selected boys are given coaching at games in the morning. After breakfast I looked in at the library which is an attractive and nicely arranged room well equipped with reference books and educational as well as other literature. I then went over Ajmer House and the New Wing of: Jodhpur House which was in process of being built at the time of inspection in 1936 but has since been completed. It provides accommodation for 10 boys. I then visited Jaipur House where a progressive scheme of extension is about to be taken in hand beginning with a new wing for 10 boys in the immediate future. On my way back to lunch I saw the swimming bath. Thanks to a generous donation from His Highness the Maharaja of Rajpipla it has been possible to increase and, at the same time, improve the swimming bath. It is now delightful. The College has taken over some land, which was previously leased out in plots to farmers, and it is now being used for a riding school and for new playing fields. The space previously used for the riding school has now been converted into a grass cricket ground and two football grounds. Two hockey fields and a grass cricket ground, with a stand, have been added to the playing fields which existed this time last year. Mayo College is now the proud possessor of no less than three grass cricket grounds. Since the time of our inspection in 1936, when I was associated with Sir George Anderson the Educational Commissioner, a new Temple has been|^ completed and consecrated. It has cost Rs. 26,000/. and is both attractive and imposing. Situated, as it is, near the main building of Mayo College it fulfills a much required want as the old temple, which was outside the grounds, was in many ways unsuitable. Many Ruling Princes generously assisted with hand some donations towards the equipment and consecration of the Temple but I must make special mention of His Highness the Maharaja of Kishengarh, who apart from giving the images and contributing handsomely in other respects, has taken a close and personal interest in all arrangements connected w T ith the Temple. His Highness the Maharana of Udaipur is kindly presenting ornaments for the Divinity. His Highness the Maharaja of Panna put up money for the conversion of a stand, on the first hockey ground, into a pavilion.35 * § Aided by donations from Their Highnesses the Maharana of Udaipur, Maharaja of Jodhpur, the Maharaj Rana of Dholpur, Maharawal of Dungarpur, Mahaiawat of Partabgarh and the Nawab of Tonk and subscriptions from members of the Staff and Old Boys of Mayo College, an existing building has been converted into a Club for members of the Staff and for Old Boys. The membership is now nearly 70. Under-graduates in the College Section and School Monitors may be admitted on invitation. The Club has two tennis courts, a bowling green, a badminton court, a reading room, a card room, a kitchen and a changing room. It also has a billiard room, with a table kindly presented by the Ruling Chief of Khairagarh of the Eastern States Agency who recently left the College. This Club, which at the instance of the Staff is named after Mr. Stow the popular Principal of the College, forms an excellent meeting ground for members of Staff as well as for the many Old Boys who are constantly visiting Ajmer. On February 26th Lady Ogilvie and Major Hay inspected the gardens of the various houses of Mayo College. All were first class but the prize went to l Mai pur House whose garden was a blaze of glorious colour. The roads, hedges, trees and lawns of the grounds are magnificently maintained. I have noticed that a considerably increased area of the roads has been tarred. This not only adds to the tidy appearance of the grounds but helps to keep down dust which makes the place more healthy. The inadequacy of the Municipal water supply to the College is, I regret to say, as it was. Admittedly this year there has been general shortage of water over many parts of Rajputana and Ajmer is no exception. Nevertheless it is hoped that the Municipal Authorities will take up the question early. The College is doing what it can to keep the playing fields, and grounds generally green and have installed three electric pumps for one of which His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur has recently given a gift which will provide the College with a grass Polo ground; but nevertheless the supply remains inadequate. On the third day of our inspection, namely February 27th, yet another generous gift appeared from His Highness of Jodhpur in the shape of a Morris motor car. On this the boys will be taught motor mechanism and driving. I met and talked to, I should say, some seventy or eighty boys whom I met in the playing fields and various boarding houses. Their manners and appearance were excellent and they have the ease of manner and s&lt;wnir fairs essential to a gentleman. Many will never have to earn their li\ing but v ill have to manage their States and Estates. For such Mayo College gi\es facilities for administrative training in co-operation with the local cnil authorities. For the others who will have to earn their living an employment information bureau has been started and it is the endeavour of the authorities, through it, to interest boys early in life in various professions and then to give them specialised tuition fitting them for those professions. Only a very few appear to have any desire to go into the Indian Ci\il Sei\ ice. I vas not able to find that any boy wanted to become a doctor, veterinary sur geon, engineer or lawyer. Several appeared to me to want to join the Army and I cannot think of better material than the Mayo College boy for the Army, Indian Navy or Air Force. A few seemed to fancy the Railway but the majority are aiming for civil, military or police service in their own States.36 During the year under report the College Section has been affiliated with the Agra University. Mayo College is therefore the only Princes College at present from which a degree can be obtained. This is likely to attract sons of Ruling Princes and Nobles from outside Rajputana. In conclusion I would like to pay the same tribute as I paid last year to Mr. Stow and his staff for the magnificent condition of Mayo College and all that he ami they are doing for it G. L.

Excellency, We have the honour to inform you that our Centre will publish from the 1st January 1938, a Univer sal Collection of Laws and Decrees, containing the legis lation of all countries of the world, issued the preceding month. This monthly collection, of 500 to 600 pages, will be in French with English translations and summaries, rigorously revised, and will have its content ordered with progressive indexes in legal categories and therein ac cording to countries and dates. Thereby it will show day by day the entire legislation of each territory having the right to legislate, that of one given country on one parti cular subject and that for all countries of the world on a certain subject. This will constitute an unprecedented documentation service, of most considerable value for all those who have an interest in the legislation of their country, since it will be most precious to them to know the legislation of the other Parliaments and Governments, as well as their own. Since the legislation of all countries enjoying the right to legislate will be reproduced and classified in that publication, according not to their territorial importance but to their legal achievements, we shall need for that work to be in possession of all the official journals published in the world, - and, in the particular case, the Official Gazette of the country governed by Your Excellency.

It was immediately acclaimed the most important legal work ever published. The second edition, published in 1906, had a similar success. Now, thirty-two years later, comes the third edition, completely revised and largely re-written under the scholarly editorship of Master E. A. Jelf. LEGAL REFERENCE WORK LIMIT OF LIABILITY.—The Publishers undertake that this edition of THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA, including the Table of Cases and Index and the volume of legal biography, will not exceed sixteen volumes. Thus the total expense to the subscriber is k noi vn exactly at the time the contract is made and there is no uncertain dragging on of the series. NEW EDITION In the past thirty years, English Law has been, in many respects, revolu tionised. The number of specialist treatises and textbooks dealing with these changes has grown tremendously. The publishers were frequently asked by owners of previous editions when a new up-to-date edition of The ENCYCLOPEDIA would be issued. For the whole Profession has long recognised that this work embodies in the most lucid, easily ascertainable manner the law as it is and as it was on any subject. It is therefore of the utmost value to both specialists and Solicitors m general practice. EASY FOR REFERENCE No system of reference work can compare in usefulness with an alphabetically arranged encyclopedia. Generous cross references, sub-headings and tables of contents to all the main articles make it a matter of a few moments to turn up any point of law. Every branch of law is fully covered, and the subjects are reviewed as a whole, showing the relationship between case and statute law. Where further information on a subject is required, bibliographies and case references show quickly where it is to be found. !

Thus is the task of reference made easier still. Turning up a point or an authority in The Encyclopedia is a matter of a very few moments. In offices where time is money, this will be appreciated to the full. VOLUME OF LEGAL BIOGRAPHY For the first time, in a work of this kind, there will be a volume of critical legal biography, including a List of the English Judges from the Norman Con quest to 1937. This is a great adjunct to The Encyclopedia which we are sure will be appreciated by subscribers. CROSS REFERENCE TO “MEWS’ DIGEST” A further convenience, particularly to those who own or have access to the last edition of “ Mews’ Digest of English Case Law,” is that case references bear a reference to that work or to its supple ments. For the convenience of the legal profession in Scotland, references to Scots cases will also include a reference to “ The Scots Digest.” ALWAYS UP-TO-DATE The difficulty with a reference work of this nature is to see that the information it contains is always accurate and up-to-date. The publishers have met this point by arranging for cumulative supplements to be issued periodically, in which alterations in the^ law will be noted and explained and the references to the main body of the work clearly marked. SCHOLARLY AND AUTHORITATIVE This edition is under the direction of the Editor-in-Chief, Master E. A. Jelf, Senior Master of the Supreme Court. For contributors he has gathered about him eminent authorities on every aspect of the law. REGULAR PUBLICATION The publishers are aiming at issuing one volume regularly every two or three months. In this way the subscriber not only ka^ws when to expect the completion of his set, but payment for 1 HE Encyclopedia is spread evenly over a known period. PAPER AND BINDING The new edition of The Encyclopedia is available in thick or thin paper form at the same cost. The finest quality paper has been secured for both editions, which will be handsomely and strongly bound in buckram. Some Eminent Contributors to the Early Volumes E.

I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, r / f Principal, Mayo College. V ^ £: § u t iAnnual Report on the Working of the Mayo College, Ajmer. 1938 - 1939 . 1. Management. —As in the previous year, the offices of the President and Vice-President of the General Council of the College have been held during the year under report by flis Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur and His Highness the Maharaja of Jaipur respectively and that of the Chairman of the Working Committee by His Highness the Maharaj Rana of Dholpur. During the year the place of Lt.-Col. G. L. Betham, c.i.e., m.c., Resident in Mewar and Political Agent, Southern Rajputana States, as the Political Officer nominated to the two bodies was taken by Mr. C. L. Corfield, c.i.e. , i.c.s., Resident at Jaipur. The General Council met on 10th December 1938 and the Working Committee on December 10th, 1938 and on April 15th, 1939. 2. Finance. —The following is a condensed statement of the financial results of the year’s working:— Total income Deduct —Abnormal non-recurring receipts ... Normal income ... ••• Total expenditure Deduct —Abnormal non-recurring expenditure Less abnormal savings Nett normal expenditure ... Surplus of nett normal income over nett normal expenditure ... ... ... 10,600 3. Buildings and Grounds. —The scheme as sanctioned for the provision of houses for members of the Indian staff in the College grounds was completed early in the year by the addition of two more houses to those already built, bringing the total to ten. Gardens have been made in each house and the area has been planted with trees and now forms an attractive as well as useful addition to the College. The success of the scheme warrants the provision of further houses which I hope to undertake in the near future. Rs. Rs. 2,08,830 17,560 1,91,270 1 , 88,620 25,550 17,600 7,950 1,80,670The new Cricket ground near the Main Gate called after Lt.-Col. W. Loch, c.i.e., Principal of the College from 1877 to 1903, has been levelled and turfed and gives the College a second full-sized grass ground suitable for important matches. A tarred road-way has been made round the Main Building with the result that class-rooms are no longer invaded by dust from passing vehicles. In the Monsoon term a Primary School for the children of College servants was opened in the stables area, His Highness the Maharao of Kotah having very kindly authorised the use of part of the Kotah stables for the purpose. The school, which owes its inception largely to the initiative and generosit}' of Col. Howson and is supported by voluntary subscriptions and by gifts of material from members of the staff and boys, has proved of great benefit to those for whom it was intended and now contains 65 boys. 4. Supplies. —The Sub-Committee appointed to replace the existing Modi system by a College Store under contract completed its labours at the beginning of the school year. The Modis were awarded compensation on mutually agreed terms and a contractor was selected. It was intended to build a new College Store including a “Tuck shop” for boys but the failure of the Monsoon and the resultant water shortage caused the postponement of the work which it is intended to undertake after the next Rains. With the replacement of the Modi system a re-organized supply Committee was formed to supervise not only the Store but also all supplies for boys. The object of this change is to ensure supplies of all kinds of good quality at reasonable rates and to cut down unnecessary expenditure on the part of boys. The Committee is at present engaged in working out details for the effective supervision by the College of supplies of all kinds including clothing, and this may necessitate the extension of the store system in the College replacing outside suppliers. 5. Projected developments. —The failure of the Monsoon caused the postponement of two other developments mentioned in my last report, the building of a Gymnasium, for which a donation had been made by His Highness the Maharaja of Tehri-Garhwal to commemorate his sons’ association with the College, and the_ starting of a Dairy Farm. The former will be built at the earliest possible opportunity and it is hoped that the scheme for the latter will receive the sanction of the General Council' durino’ the . •* - O coming year. A little time back the Working Committee of the College passed a resolution favouring the replacement of the present system of a number of small State Boarding Houses by a few up to date Boarding Houses on Public School lines. As a substantial step towards the fulfilment of this aim plans are under preparation for the building of a large Junior Boarding House with modern equipment and sanitary arrangements, to be run on full Public School lines. It is proposed to build this House adjoining Jhalawar House, using the latter as class-rooms for the Junior section of the School and transferring the College Section lecture-rooms from that House to new lecture rooms to be built adjoining Colvin House. The advantages claimed for this3 t * proposal are that it will effect a desirable separation of senior and junior bo&gt; s by providing a Junior school and relieve the present congestion in the Main Building, which is at present overcrowded, and make rooms available for special purposes such as History and a Museum, and will also save College Section students the inconvenience and waste of time involved in going an appreciable distance to and from lectures. In the Junior House accommodation is contemplated for 40 boys and it is proposed to charge an inclusi\e Schooling and Boarding fee, which while being moderate will both cover expenses and yield some return on the capital outlay so that the scheme will be largely self-supporting. The scheme will be ready for submission to the General Council at the beginning of the next school year. I sincerely hope that it will be sanctioned as I feel that it will be a marked asset and a move in the right direction. There are at present 10 regular Boarding Houses in the College including the Colvin House for College Section students. In a residential educational institution of 160 boys this number is excessive and moreover, apart from the question of parochialism, most of the existing Houses are too small for vigorous corporate life. I should like to see one Boarding House for the College Section as at present, Colvin House being of adequate size unless the rise in numbers of the College Section is more than anticipated, and not more than five for the School Section. The latter aim will be difficult to accomplish particularly as the Boarding Houses m the School Section are not the property of the College but my experience during the past few years here of the difficulties of administration resulting from a number of small scattered Boarding Houses convinces me that every effort should be made to accomplish the aim. 6. Staff. I was on leave during the Monsoon term during, which Mr. W. H. Bradshaw officiated as Principal. Mr. M. A. McCanlis, m.a., (Oxon) joined his appointment as Vice- Principal in place of Col. Howson, in October. The latter returned to the College in July as Guardian to the Maharaj Kumar of Baria, and my thanks are due to him and to Major Hannay for the valuable help they have been good enough to give in the various activities of the College. Mr. H. K. Kefford, b.a , additional temporary English Assistant Master, left the College in October to take up a guardianship at the Rajkumar College, Raipur. At the beginning of the academic year the College Section staff was streno-thened by a number o£ new appointments o£ specially qualified lecturers, on improved rates of pay and the creation of an additional post £or the instruction of the Army Class. The new appointments were:— Mr. Rajendra Nath, m.a. Mr. S. C. Datta, m.a., l.t. Mr. R. R. Kasliwal, m.a. Mr. M. C. Dhawan, m.a., b.t. (Army class.)4 The Indian staff in the School Section was strengthened on the mathematical side by the appointment of another trained and qualified Mathematics master, Mr. Din Dayal, m.a., b.t. In accordance with the practice of recent years on the return of Mr. Sharman from his trainingcourse Mr. Raghubir Dayal m.a. was deputed to the Central Training cS^fEahore, for training. Of the members of the regular Indian teaching staff appointed to the School Section since 1931, all except one are now trained teachers with certificates of high class. The policy of devolving powers and responsibilities on members of the Staff has been adopted wherever feasible. The powers of control of House Masters have been considerably enlarged and powers of independent punishment have been given to all members of the Staff. 7. The College Roll.— At the beginning of the academic year the College roll stood at 155. Admissions during the year numbered 36 and withdrawals 31 and the roll at the end of the school consequently stands at 160, the highest figure for 25 years. Of the admissions 25 came from Rajputana and 11 from areas outside including the Gujarat Agency, the Western India States Agency, Hyderabad, Behar, the Bombay Presidency and the Central Provinces. Details of admissions will be found in Appendix C. Of the present roll of 160, 128 belong to Rajputana and 32 outside. Of the former, as in recent years, the Jodhpur, Jaipur and Kotah States are the most strongly represented with 31, 29 and 13 respectively and the Sirohi, Jaisalmer, Partabgarh, and Karauli states are at present unrepresented. In the College Section numbers have shown a welcome rise from 17 to 23 and I trust that this improvement which has been largely due to the attractions of the new Army Class will be maintained. 8. Instruction. —In the College Section the Army Class started in the previous year has been developed into a fully organized and separate unit preparing candidates both for the I.M.A. Entrance Examination and the Indian Army Special Certificate, and as previously stated an additional appointment has been made to the staff for the purpose. The class has this year attracted 6 students of whom one appeared for the I M.A. Entrance Examination and was successful and another has recently appeared for the Indian Army Special Certificate with results not yet known. In an institution like the Mayo College there is material specially well-qualified to make officers and a steady influx of such boys into the Army would both assist the Army to find officers of a suitable type and also help to solve the problem, which is steadily growing, of suitable employ ment for younger sons. Unfortunately, if such boys still have to depend for their commissions on competing in a literary examination with some of the cleverest boys in India, their entry must be very limited. If special facilities could be given to such boys or entry to the I.M.A. made to depend far more than at present on record and interview than on mere literary attainment, and even in some cases purely on selection, much of the problem would be solved.5 n€) Upto the present there has been no desire on the part o£ Mayo College boys to enter the Indian Navy but steps are in contemplation m consultation with the authorities that may change matters. In the LA. and B.A. classes the tutorial system has been adopted to supplement class instruction and has proved beneficial. In the School Section no major innoVations have been made in the syllabuses and curriculum both of which were revised in the previous year. An additional class called the Remove has been formed and the lower section of the 8th or bottom class has been made into an entirely separate class, the 9th. There are thus now ten classes in the school and of these the bth owino' to numbers has been sub-divided temporarily into two parallel sections. O 9 The appointment of a new Drawing and Arts Master has led to a most encouraging development in the art and expressional side. Supplementary to class instruction a Fine Arts Society has been formed on a voluntary basis and the Society which has a large membership held a very creditable exhibition at the time of the Prize-Giving. Formerly the teaching of Drawing and Painting was confined to the four lowest classes. It has now been extended to the next two classes and I hope to extend it up to the top class. Among other innovations may be mentioned the introduction of Mental Arithmetic cards to assist speed and accuracy in Mathematics, which subject is a decided stumbling block to the average Mayo College boy, and the institution of English debates in class to promote facility in English. Examination results.- In the College Section 4 candidates appeared in April 1938 in the Chief’s Colleges Higher Diploma Examination and all were successful, two candidates appeared in the Intermediate Examination of the Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Rajputana-, Central India and Gwalior and one was successful, the other failing by a small margin, and ’ll candidates appeared in the Chief’s Colleges Diploma Examination aU of whom were successful. The results of the Examinations of 1939 are not yet known. 10 Physical Trainia* and Games.-Riding.-The Squadron has done creditable work during the year and the thanks of the College are due to Col. Howson, who was good enough to continue in charge of Riding after his retirement from the service of the College, and to Major Hannay and Maharaj Hanuwant Singh who have rendered him valuable assistance. The strength of the Squadron at the end of the school year was 39 and the new comers included 4 boys below the age of ten. In an institution like the Mayo College with a roll of 160 I think that the Squadron should be lamer than it is and I hope to see in it next term a number of boys who can well afford to ride but do not do so at present. The all-round training in riding given by the Squadron is not only in keeping with the traditions of the class of boy for whom the Mayo College caters buUs also likely to prove a useful asset in after life._ 6 For the first time in its history, the College was repiesented in February at the Imperial Delhi Horse Show when a party of six junior riders competed in the children’s events and secured one first and two second prizes. Next year I should like to see senior riders competing also. With 20 regular players and others practising there has been a noticeable advance in the general standard of Polo. The College won the Rajputana and Central India Low Handicap Tournament and got into the semi-final of the Kotah Cup Tournament, while for the first time four teams took part in the Inter House Tournament for the Dhonkal Cup. The Squadron w r as inspected and the annual competitions in April were judged, as in the two previous years, by Capt. J. Paterson, Assistant Mililtary Adviser Rajputana States Forces, who commented on an all-round advance which was perhaps particularly noticeable in the general standard of jumping. Games.—The annual tournament with the Daly College w 7 as held at Indore in February and the Daly College by three events to tw 7 o regained the Kishengarh Shield which the Mayo College had held for the two previous years. The Mayo College won the Cricket and the Sports, the former by 253 for 9 wickets declared to 147 and the latter by 5 events to 0, but lost the Tennis by 2 matches to 1, the Squash by 4 matches to 1, and the Hockey by 2—0* The result of the last named event, which w r as expected to be the deciding factor in the tournament, was disappointing as the side which had proved itself capable of good form in previous matches failed to play up to expectations. I feel that the organization of this tournament needs revision. The preparation of teams for and their participation in five events at the same time involve an undue strain especially when, as not unfrequently happens, one boy has to take part in three or four of the five events, and also preclude, what I hold to be very desirable, the observance of regular seasons for games. If boys have to go on playing the same games during most of the school year their interest and form naturally suffer. I should like the Tournament to be conducted in two instalments each year, the Cricket and the Hockey being played at one College just before the X’mas holidays and the Sports, Tennis, and Squash taking place at the other College in March. At first sight this proposal may seem open to objection on the grounds of the extra expense involved, but I think that details could be so arranged that on the whole the change would lessen expenditure. I should also like to see Football included in the tournament as a substitute for Hockey in alternate years, as Football is I consider in several ways a better school game than Hockey, but the nature of the soil at Indore precludes lootball at the Daly College from attaining sufficient standing to be included in the Tournament. 10. Important Events. —The Prize-Giving and Old Boys Gathering which were attended by five Ruling Princes and nearly a hundred Old Boys took place on December 10th and 11th. As the President of the General Council, His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur, was unable to be present the Vice-President, His Highness the Maharaja of Jaipur presided at the former and the latter included as usual matches between Past and Presentat Cricket, Polo, Tennis, and Squash, the teams at Polo including a father and son in opposition. The College was inspected on behalf of the Crown Representative by Mr. J. Sargent, m.a., Educational Commissioner with the Government of India and by Lt. Col. G. V. B. Gillan, c.i.e,, Resident, Western Rajputana States, in February. A copy of the inspection report of the latter is given in Appendix E: the report of the former has not yet been received. Tours during the X’mas holidays were arranged as usual both for the College Section and the School Section, but the former had to be cancelled owing to an accident to Mr. Ede and a number of College Section students were consequently included in the School section tour. A party of twenty m all including the members of the staff in charge had a most successful tour by sea to Ceylon visiting Poona and Bombay en route. The success of the tour was reflected by a number of applications later for a tour to Austra 1 a during the Summer vacation but in view of the uncertainty of the Internationa situation the idea was dropped for this year. It is difficult to exaggerate the value of such tours which have now become a regular feature of life at the Mayo College and which I hope to see further extended. Apart from the broadening of outlook and adaptability which they promote, varied conditions of travel in which servants are useless encourage boys to be independent and self-reliant. U.

Sargent, Educational Commissioner with the Government ot‘ India in ids inspection of the Mayo College on the 2nd February 1939. , 2. I have nothing to add to the comments I made last year on the very high standard maintained- by the Mayo College in buildings, games fields and externals generally. It is a pleasure to go round the College. 3. I was chiedy concerned last year in endeavouring to ascertain whether the College was carrying'out two functions which appear to me of very great importance if this exclusive and expensive form of education is to be fully justified: — («) giving the young Ruler, Thakur or Landowner some practical teaching in agriculture, land revenue and estate management and rousing his inteie&amp;t in those subjects, (H) affording an opportunity for entering the Army or Police to the younger brothers of future Rulers, Thakurs and Landowners who are by birth and temperament particularly well fitted for the higher public services and for whom suitable employment is most difficult to find. In regard to (i), progress has been made with plans and estimates for a Model Dairy farm, land has been set aside for this farm and arrangements CD have been made for tuition to be given by a qualified instructor from Lyallpur. The serious prevailing water shortage, caused by three successive poor monsoons, prevents any further progress for the present. Land Revenue, Administration and practical Surveying form one of the subjects taught and are an alternative subject for the Diploma Examination. There is a proposal under consideration to replace the latter examination by the Cambridge School Certificate examination and there is much to be said in favour of substituting for what has become a private examination one which is so widely recognised. I had formed the impression that the change, if effected, might interfere with the teaching of Land Revenue, Administration and Surveying as a recognised subject, but the Educational Commissioner tells me that the Cambridge School Certificate Examination is an clastic one as regards the subjects to be offered and that there is no reason to suppose that this particular subject could not be included therein. In regard to (ii) the Army Class has been developed into a fully organised and separate unit of the Post Diploma or College Section and prepares candidates for the I. M. A. Entrance Examination and the Army Special Certificate. One candidate was sent up for the last I. M. A, Entrance Exami nation and passed 4th. Thcie aie now 6 students m the Army Classj this is a good bcc r mnin (r and it is hoped that the number will increase. ML4. The Working Committee have approved of a proposal to replace the existing large number of small Boarding Houses by a few larger Houses run on complete Public Schools lines. The proposal seems an excellent one; at present there are no fewer than 10 houses for the 160 boys in the College and each house must necessarily be much too small to give any of the advan tages of the House system as understood in a Public School. The suggestion is that one of the new houses should be an exclusively Junior house, and this is certainly to be commended. 5. It is proposed to eliminate Indian Guardians at the College and to allow Tutors only in a few very exceptional cases such tutors to be appointed by the Principal and to be well paid qualified teachers. I am much in favour of this proposal and trust it may be found possible, when the house system has been fully established, to eliminate all private servants. 6. The question is still being discussed whether the Mayo College should continue as it is or should open its doors to classes hitherto excluded. 7. I agree entirely with the Principal that there can be no middle course. Either the Colleo-e should continue to be a Chiefs’ College confined to the sons and relations of Ruling Princes, Chiefs and of the Landed nobility, or it should become a Public School open to any one who can afford to pay the exiienses. It is no use opening the College to a small number of boys drawn from excluded classes. 8. I do not myself see the necessity for making any change at present. The numbers are well sustained at about 160; without additional expense on building there is no room for much expansion; and if, as may be the case, other Chiefs’ Colleges prove unable to maintain their original role that is no reason why one such institution should not continue to do so; it might in fact ultimately gain by receiving pupils of its own particular class from other areas.
