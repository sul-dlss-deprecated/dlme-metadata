In any case I decided to send the Acting Oriental.

I directed Mr. Monypenny to say that l regarded such a note as the one I had received as deliberately provocative and as quite incompatible with the professions of the Persian Government of a desire for friendly relations with Hi® Majesty’s Government; to warn the Ministers that if I hod to tahe up this aaatter myself* I should not tail to make myself | extremely disagreeable: that they had better therefore put Ihe Most Honourable ^ ^ ^ v a flie Marquess Cur a on of He a less ton, etc. 9 eta.* etc* * Foreign Office.($ga.) ^isaot x*).;.au,;. an end to the question ran icily .md that the best my of doing 30 was to withdraw the note which had given me such offence.

I drew his Highness’s especial attention to the conciliatory spirit m which His Majesty s Government had dealt with the incident of 1904, but pointed out that the essence ; of the matter was one on which they could not possibly compromise; the She ™ t { Shargah was under their protection, and they would, if necessary, take action unhold his rights on the Island of Abu Musa. , w His Highness listened carefully to what I had to say, but did not offer any comment.

Thai was the present situation, and His Majesty’s Government would unhesitatingly reject any attempt on the part of Persia or any other country to claim the sovereignty of^Bahrein^ t j ie Persian Government would be careful to refrain from any action in that sense, which would be inadvisable at any time, but especia y so at a moment when his Highness, as he had told me several times aimed at a restoration of the old relations of friendly and mutual confidence between Great Britain and Persia. 0I , les 0 f this despatch to the Government of India, His Majesty™ High Commissioner at Bagdad, and to His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire. j have, &amp;c.

STRJCK &amp; COMPANY, LIMITED1 ■ « EXifaiACT FROM LETTER DATED 30TH APRIL, 1923 FROM ARDESH1RJI EDUUX,TEHERAN. i I have in the course of the last fortnight had occasions to meet Haji Moin-ut-Tojjar and discuss the natter at due length with him and my impression is that all his tali talk about proposals having emanated from American and (Jerman buyers is but a fiction and nothing short of a pure bluff. He often avers he prefers you to all others because of your being very well circumstanced and quite capable of working the business successfully, but at the same time assures me confi dentially (?) that the Persian government and the great majority of the members of the Mejliss insist on his prefering Americans and non-Britishers of other nationalities to British Firms and he therefore finds himself in a very awkward position and has therefore to handle the matter with due delicacy. Of course, there is a wild and utterly stupid sort of anti-British attitude prevailing in this country for certain reasons obvious enoughy. but 1 do not think Haji Moin-ut-Tojjar attaches any importance to them or is at all very particular about the interest of the Persian Government. As to the Persian Government being urged to claim Abu Musa as being within Persian jurisdiction, Haji Moin-ut-Tojjar has been mainly instrumental in that connection and though the Home and Foreign Offices here have been asked by the Mejliss to fully enquire into the matter and report there upon, no attempt has yet been made in the said direction so far as my private information secured through confidential sources as concerned. However, I have deemed it both urgent and advisable to report the matter to H-B-M’s Minister and the Commercial Secretary in the person of Mr Robert Hadow m time and I have been asked to submit my private and confidential information to them whenever available. Certainly the Persian Government and Haji Mo m-utr io j jar could hardly conceive their actual plight in conneel&amp;bi- 2 - w ith your 1(11116ly acquisilion of t-he Ai&gt;u Musa concession before this and it is our old friend Haji Moin-ut-Tojjar who is busy trying to force the Persian Government to order the suspension of all mining or other operations at Abu Musa, through the Mejliss. He believes, on grounds of his own, that the Persian Government will have anyhow to adopt strong and even drastic measures in this connection, but I am in no w r ay inclined to attach any importance to this bluff of his and w r hene\er any action on the part of the Persian Government in this connection seems certain I shall be in a position to report the same to H.B JI's Legation here in time. During my two hours conversation w 7 ith Haji Moin-ut— Tojjar this afternoon I could well discern his favorable attitude towards you because of a full appreciation of your actual position and I am,■therefore, inclined to believe he will ff.il not to come to terms with us. Permit me to record an important matter in connection with Map. Mo in-ub-Toj jar’s real object in coming to terms with us for your information here . Considering the notorious fact of the interests of Persian subjects not being well protected or safeguarded by the Persian Government, a certain degree of British support and protection could be secured by very many of those in his position through theireconnection with British Pirns and concerns of your type and Haji Moin-ut-Tojjar being too astute to realize this, it is quite natural that he may welcome all such means of strengthening his own position .Howso ever, influential a Persian subject of Haji Moin’s position be in Persia, he can never feel secure and safe unless some foreign and outside support or influence in some shape be his lot and Haji Moin and those in his position must needs have and welcome it.

Despite our interest in Abu Musa, however, we have continued to follow up matters relating to Ormuz, and our Teheran Agents, Messrs . Sorabjee Dorabjee &amp; Co., (whose Local Representative is Mr.Ardeshirji Edulji) have, from time to time, advised us as to the position. Under date of 7th April, we were advised by cable that Haji Moin-ut-Tojjar had obtained a fifteen years' concession, and we enclose for your perusal a copy of our Teheran Agent's letter on the subject, of 29th March, received to-day. We instructed our Agents to ascertain from Haji Moin-utr-Tojjar whether he was prepared to negotiate with us, and we do not think we can do better than send you copies of the telegrams exchanged on the subject. You will notice, that, in the last Teheran telegram received this morning, Haji Moin-ut-Tojjar asserts that there are American and German buyeis submitting offers, and to this message we are replying to-day as follow's:- ' REFERRING TO YOUR TELEGRAM OF 21st ABU MOB A HAVE CONCESSION 'SOME YEARS DIRECT FROM SHEIKH OF SHARGAH WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE 'AND APPROVAL BRITISH RESIDENT CONSEQUENTLY OUR POSITION ABSOLUTE 'STOP.

Gentlemen, My last communication to you was dated the 15th inst., and since then I have had your favour of the 6th ult., on the 25th inst., and have duly noted its contents. As I last wrote you the Mejliss has now duly approved an sanctioned Haji Moin-ut-Tojjar’s offer in an essentially modified form, hut because of the Persian New' Year holidays lasting till the 2nd prox., the details have not yet been determined and con cluded. Haji Moin-ut-Tojjar will work the Hormuz Oxide Mines at his own expense for a period of fifteen years beginning fiom the 21st inst., i.e. the Persian New Year and instead of paying the annual royalty of a hundred thousand tomans to the Government, w'ill pay 50/£ of the net profit to them. As I repeatedly wiote you in my previous letters, his only object in connection with the said royalty of a hundred thousand tomans was to realise his claim of hearly 400,000 tomans and since the Mejliss declined to at all recognise this claim of his, a compromise to the said effect was brought about and it is to be seen, when the details* are duly determined how the concessionnaire avails himself of the prize. Were it not for curruption being as rife as ever, Haji Moin-ut- Toiiar would never have succeeded in this adventure of his but considerable despite this success of his, he is sure to experience^difiiculties and in order to obviate the same, he will have to come to due terms with us.

The Commercial Secretary, A Red oxide concession for the Tehran island of Hormuz. 8th February Despatch (0.T.7)No. Overseas Trade 7. British Legation, Tehran. February 8th 1923. My Lord, A Red Oxide concession for the island of Hormuz, which formed the subject of Your Lordship’s despatch No. T.C. 494 of the 18th August last, has recently been before the Majlis. A prominent Bushira merchant, Haji Moin-ut-Tujjar, has submitted an offer to the Persian Government which amounts to the 100 , 000 .payment of one hundred thousand Tomans a year for the privilege of working the Oxide deposits of Hormuz for fifteen years. Ha offers to bear the expenses of extracting the Oxide and the Majlis have insisted on the insertion of a clause to the effect that the concession can in no way be turned over to a foreign subject. This clause together with the rest of the proposal has not yst been approved but it is apparently actuated merely by the Anglophobia of certain elements in the Majlis since they acimit having no objection to American participation. it is also suggested that at the expiration of the lease all Oxide on the island should belong to the Persian Government as well as machinery used by the concessionnaire for its extraction. The right of constructing a tramway for leading the Oxide on to ships is to be given and all machinery and implements used for extracting the ore are to be imported duty free. The Question of payment of these royalties is an inter esting and complicated one. Your Lordship will remember from the correspondenca which took place in 1910, with Messrs. Frank OfricK and Company and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Company that Haji Moin-ut- Tujjar claimed to have held until then a Firman entitling him to e 2 »t r ac t • • • • His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the Department of Overseas Trade.Ts.200,000 - Ts.250^00. $ 16. ^105,000. extract the iron Oxide from Hormuz island in perpetuity, fhe cancellation of these rights hy the Persian Government has since then formed the 'basis of a claim 'by Haji Ho in-ut-Pujjar for a sum approximating two hundred to two hundred and fi-i.ty thousand Tomans and it is an open secret that Moin-ut-Tuijar t m making his present offer, intended to offset this claim against the royalty payments for the first two or three years in the case of the present concession. At the end oi that time it is said he would allow the concession to lapse. Certain elements in the Majlis, hostile to Moin-ut-Tujjar are, however, deter mined not to pass the concession until a clause has been in serted to the effect that the previous debts of the Persian Government to the concessionnaire will in no wise be taken into account to offset the payment of royalties and that payment must be made regularly each year unless the Concessionnaire is prevented by force majeure from working the Oxide deposits. The late Prime Minister, His Highness Qawam es Saltaneh, was known to favour Haji Moin-ut-Pujjar’s proposals partly, it is said because of the political support which the latter was able,to afford him through the Southern Deputies in the Majlis. then, therefore, an offer by a supposed American syndicate of sixteen dollars per ton P.O.B. purchase price, or one hundred and five thousand dollars a year royalty, was cabled to the Persian Government by Hussein khan Alai, the Persian Minister in Washington, Qawam es Saltaneh did not give it his support. I have endeavoured, by all means in my power, to ascertain the name of the syndicate, hut although I have been shown,‘in confidence, copies of the telegrams sent from* Washington, I have failed entirely to obtain from any source whatever the mention of the syndicate's name and I am inclined to believe that Hussein Qian's optimism is responsible in part for the amount of the offer mentioned which may or may not have been made in earnest by a reputable American firm. The effectof it, however, was to cause a certain amount of opposition in the Majlis particularly on the part of deputies hostile to Qawam es Saltaneh and support is said to have been given to the American offer hy Mirza Reza Khan Afshar, Persian Assistant to the American Administrator General of Persian Finances who is in close touch with Hussein Khan Alai and received details of the American- offer from the latter for publication when the Prime Minister refused to give them adequate publicity in the Majlis. It appears from Your Lordship's despatch under reference that Messrs.Frank Strick and Company are not grealy concerned with the maintenance of their option to renew their present concession at Hormuz and the local agent for this firm, Mr. Ardeshir Edulgi, who has been in close contact with the Legation and the Majlis Deputies in this matter, is of the opinion that Messrs. Frank Strick and Company's interests would bast be served if Moin-ut-Tujjar obtains the concession since he is not in a position himself to export the Oxide and iMessrs, btrick have exceptional, if not unique facilities.for I |its shipment to America. In the present temper of the Majlis it is certain that any attempt to enforce Messrs. Stride's prior rights would merely lead to the grant of the concession to Haji Moin-ut- Tujjar and for these reasons His Majesty's Minister has refrain ed from pressing the Persian Government to renew Messrs, i’rank Strick's concession. As yet the Bill for the concession has only passed its first reading in the Majlis and the insertion of the clause nullifying Haji Moin's previous claims on the Persian Government has not been made. Most of the articles have, however, been referred to the Majlis Commission for amendment and it is confidently asserted that the insertion of this clause is sine qua ...•I ; p '' ^ I 1 0 5 8 qua non with the opposit ionr&lt;; It may ba doubted whether Haji Moin is in a position or intends to make the monetary payment of one hundred thousand Ts.lM.000. tomans a yjar to the Persian Government tut I am assured that his concession will be granted shortly. It therefore seems likely that he will extract what Oxide ha can, delay payment for as long as possibla, and finally, if he does not secure the acknowledgement of the Persian Government's debt to him in part payment of their claim for royalties, he will refuse to make payment of the latter and allow the concession to lapse. ; Meanwhile Messrs. Strick will doubtless be able to arrange with | him to purchase the Oxide at Hormuz on terms satisfactory to both parties should they he in need of Oxide for the American marks ts.

'Golshan' appears to be the telegraphic address of one Asghar Agha Yezdi, who is the Bandar Abbas agent of Agha Mahomed Husain of Yezd, a merchant who does business in Yezd, Kerman and India. He appears to be little known here, end his agent here is not an important merchant. The Director of Customs informs me that the Persian Government have informed Messrs P.Strick that they hold themselves free to dispose of the Hormuz oxide as they think fit, and that Messrs Strick have no lien upon any stocks. He added that the Persian Government appears to want a bigger price than Messrs Strick are prepared to give. At the same time the Customs contractor here refuses to work and ship the oxide, unless his contract rates are raised, and the Tehran Customs Administration has refused to sanction the higher rates. It does not therefore seem likely that any oxide will be mined, unless a Company undertakes the mining of it, and for that purpose a good local agent would be almost essential. I shall be glad to receive instructions as early as possible as to the nature of the reply I should give to Messrs Weir &amp; Co.Copy of a letter ^iated 21st September 1922, from Messrs Andrew Weir &amp; Co., Basra to H.B.M.Consul, Bandar Abbas.

You might add that the mines are controlled by the Persian Government and that there are no merchants who deal in the commodity. SdA A.P.Trevor, Lt. Col., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.COHPIDEWTIAI. Ho. 760- S of 1922. Eritisli Residency and Consulate—General, Bnshire, 19th September 1922. Sir, With reference to your despatch Overseas frade Ho.6 dated 18th-August 1922 regarding iron oxide mined on the island of Hormuz, X have the honour to inform you that I do not know how the negotiations between the Persian Government and Messrs. F.C.Strick and Co.(which are being conducted either in London or Tehran) are progressing, but doubtless such information as may be available will be obtained from the Foreign Office or H.M. Minister at Tehran. I have, however, heard that two merchants of Buahire, one a Persian and the other an Armenian, are trying to secure a concession from the Persian Government to mine and export Hormuz oxide with the avowed attention, should they be successful, of transferring the concession to Messrs the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, by which is pro bably meant Messrs. F.C. Strick and Co., the local Managing Agents of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company being Messrs.Striek Scott and Company. As regards paragraph 3 of your letter (a) I do not know amount of stocks at present held by ' Messrs Strick, but 7174 tons of oxide were delivered to them during 1921 and 636 tons to date during 1922. (b) As far as I am aware no stocks are held by merchants To The Comptroiler-G-eneral, Department of Overseas Trade, 35, Old Queen Street, London.M'S:-'merchants other than Messrs Strict, and no oxide has 'been delivered to any other merchant. (c) There is no oxide ready for shipment at present, and it would take 3 months at least after mining had been restarted before even 1,000 tons of oxide could be ready for export, and it would not be worth while to commence mining operations for a smaller amount than that. It must also be remembered that owing to climatic condi tions mining operations cannot be carried on during the hot test months of the hot weather i.e. about middle of May to middle of September. (d) in alternative source of supply exists on the Island of Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf. This island does not belong to Persia hut forms part of the territories of the Sheikh of Shargah, one of the Arab Sheikhs on the 'Trucial Coast” enjoy ing British protection. Messrs Strick have just intimated their desire to open negotiations immediately with the sheikh of Shargah with a view to securing an exclusive concession extending over a period of 5 yeans for working this oxide, and I am now awaiting the sanction of the Government of India to proceed with the negotiations. I have good reason^ to believe that the Sheikh will not be averse from granting such a concession, if he is guaranteed a minimum amount of royalty per annum. The quality of the Abu Musa oxide is, I understand, slight ly inferior in quality to that on Hormuz, but it is, I believe, of (jiite good quality and finds a ready sale. The mines used to be worked by the natives, but have lain idle since just before the war. In 1906 Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company secured a contract to take all the oxide from the island for 4 years from Hassan bin Samayeh a native of Lingah who as a partner with two other persons, had a concession from the Sheikh of shargah. Hassan bin Samayeh contracted with Messrs. Wonckhaus to supply them with 2,000-5,000 tons annually.The'mine 3 n at Abu Musa are merely surface diggings but even so, if a concession is secured for the working of this oxide, it will probably take sometime before any considerable ^ quantity is ready for shipment. A copy of this despatch is being transmitted to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and the Grpvernment of India* I have the honour to be.

The Department is aware that negotiations are taking place between the Persian Government and Messrs.F.C.Strick &amp; Company for a renewal of that firm's contract hut up to the present, no information has heen received regarding their result. Moreover, information is lacking the following practical points of some importance to British manufacturers using Persian oxide. (a) The smount of stocks at present held by Messrs. Strick. (b) Whether any stocks are held by merchants other than Messrs. Strick. (c) The present condition of the workings, and the length of time which it would take before operations would again be resumed, assuming t e contract was renewed.

Iron oxide pigments comprise Venetian, Indian, Persian Tuscan etc., reds. Venetian red is a variety of red haematite of a purer red than Indian red, hut the term is loosely applied to artificial products obtained by calcining copperas or the ochres. Indian (or Persian) red is strictly speaking a native haematite of a somewhat purplish shade obtained from the Persian Gulf. It is a coarse powder of a purplish-red shade. In the trade the term is loosely used to refer to an iron oxide pigment (artificial or natural) usually containing a high percentage of Fe 203. Tuscan red is a shade of Indian red. Tnrkey red is a name given to bright oxide of iron reds of excellent quality. Uaes. Iron oxide pigments are used extensively in the manufacture of paints for protecting iron and structural steel work from rust. Also for the manufacture of (a) antifouling and anticorrosive paints for ships’ bottoms, (b) cheap paints for vehicles etc., (c) for colouring wallpaper, rubber and linoleum. High grade oxide (rouge) is used as an abrasive particularly for polishing glass. Prices. According to a recent issue of the Imperial Institute Bulletin the v/holesale prices per ton in the United Kingdom of earth colours of good quality are approximately - Indian red £20. Venetian red £15* Turkey red £30. Purple red £12* Turning to the attached statistics it will be seen that in 1913 we imported 89,294,000 kg. of oxide of iron from Italy and that supplies from this source practically ceased in 1920. Supplies have also apparently ceased from Persia in recent years and have decreased from India. These figures will no doubt explain the desire of United Kingdom firms to renew importation from Persia*4940/T.C.

Moreover no oxide is ready for shipment at present and it would take three months at least after mining had heen restarted before even 1,000 tons of oxide could he ready for export, nor would it he worth while to commence mining operations for a smaller amount than that* It must also he remembered that owing to climatic conditions mining operations cannot he carried on during the hot weather i*e* from the middle of May to the middle of September• An alternative source of supply exists on the island of Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf.

We note what you write with regard to enquiries made at Bushire, on behalf of Messrs .Strick Scott &amp; Co .Ltd., with which Company, as you are probably aware, we are very closely associated. Such enquiries, however, were,w r e think, made by Messrs .Strick Scott &amp; Co. Ltd.'s Agent under a misapprehension and withou’&gt; ''structions from his London Directors. We note that, while you have no objection, in principle , to our opening negotiations with the Sheikh of Shargah, yet, you are in consultation by eabje with the Government of India on the subject, and we gather that you would prefer us to defer action until you are in a position to communicate with us again, with which, of course, we are fully in accord, as it would doubtless be very desirable that the initial steps should be taken through the mediation of the Political Resident. We have not fully considered the basis upon which we should be prepared to interest ourselves in Abu Musa, but mey say that we should probably request our Bunder Abbas Agent — Mr.Sorabjee Dorabjee — who is well acquainted with our requirements in regard to OXIDE business, to interview the Sheikh, either himself or through an accredited and reliable representative, for the purpose ofentering into a Contract for the supply of the Mineral for a period of years. We consider that it would he preferable for the Sheikh to carry out mining operations himself under the supervision of a Representative, appointed by Mr.borabjee, or otherwise, to ensure that OXIDE of suitable quality only was extracted and shipped.

Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department ifo.2409-S. dated 17th October to the Secretary of State regarding the Abu Musa Oxide question, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, aft translated extract from the Tehran Newspaper rt Mihan tt No.76 dated 8th September 1921 on the subject of the oxide at Hormuz. It seems evident that the Newspaper believed that an American Qompany is trying to get a concession for the Hormuz oxide; ifoftc does it will become more necessary for British firms to use the Abu Musa oxide, and it is evidently urgently necessary to close the l/onckhaus , case in regard to it. The extract also shows *hat ridiculous ideas regarding the quantity and value of the oxide are prevalent even among educated people at Tehran, and it shows also that the paper is in complete ignorance of the fact that large quantities of oxide exist at Abu Musa and other places besides Hormuz.I ara sending a copy of thia lottar,unofficially, to the India Office to save tirae* I have the honour to be, Sir, Horn* moat obedient servant, Sd/- A. P. Trevor, Lieut-Oolonel, political Resident,Persian Gulf*Extract from the Persian Paper No.75 of the 8th September 1921 printed and published in Tehran. Some time ago an American Company sent a telegram to i/akil-or-Koays of Harridan for the purchase of red ochre (oxide) in the Hormuz Island, which if3 almost the only red ochre mine in the whole world and which is an indispensible port of call According tp a report received by us the British came to know about this telegram, and bought from the Mbhh± Minister of Public Affairs, about 70,000 tons or lbs at the rat© of £.3 per ton payment to be made in cash before shipping ochre in quantities gradually. Having settled this affairs so far they sent the file relating to this business to the Ministry, tfakar-os-2altaneh was surprised at this irregular act on their part and at the back of the file “This affair has hot been given due consideration yet' and then sent it in to the Minister’s office. Later on, some enthusiasts, heard of this and hastened to visit the Head of Government’* i.e. Prime Minister whom they informed of all that had come to uass. He stated that he had no knowledge of this business. In accordance with information lately received by us the Prime Minister has issued written orders that concession for red ociire should not be given to the British firm STHICK , but thefe the American Concern who had originally communicated with the Wakil-or-Koays. Comments by the Papers- If you have no knowledge of the red ochre Mine, please make enquiries from those who know. If we had a proper Ministry of Public Affairs, the Government could obtain two million tomans from this one source every year. , LIn any further communication on this subject, please quote N °- E 12103/2874/91. and address, Foreign Office. not to any person by name, S.W.l. but to— '•■^November 11th, 1921* “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. Sir: With reference to your letter No.P.-*v-*v wx 2nd instant, I am directed by the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston to sta.te that he concurs in the view expressed by Mr,Secretary Montagu that Messrs.WSnckhaus have no standing in regard to any new concession for mining or for exporting oxide mined under a new concession on Abu Musa even though their pre-war claims remain unsettled, 2, Copies of this correspondence are being sent to the Board of Trade and Colonial Office.

It does not appear whether anything further occurred; in view of^ the leisurely manner in which the whole transaction had proceeded and the short interval before war with Germany ensued it seems improbable that anything further did happen; w ; tne foreign -ill be able to say. It is however not at all clear that the completion or non-completion of that affair is necessarily relevant to the question o. now inducing the Sheikh of Shargah to grant a British subject a concession for exploiting the oxide deposits in Abu Musa Island. It depends on the precise scope of the projected concession; Aether it is for mining the oxide and exporting it, or for exporting staff mined by a local concessionaire, or possibly for exporting Jie oxide'already mined by^the previous concessionaires. (-'.3. the word njX.-gjf 4 oxid^r° 'Without recapitulating at length the controversy Jj | which dragged on from 1907 to 1914 it may be pointed out that the British case against Messrs. Wbnckhaus always maintained tnat the cancellation by the Sheikh (in February 1907) of the original concession was perfectly regular and that Messrs, 'fonckhaus' claim to have any part in the minina concession was invalid,- based as it was on shares sold by one of the original concessionaries to Mr. T. Brown (Wonckhaus' employee) eight months after notice of cancellation had been given by the Sheikh,and on the very day uiiat warning of forciW.^)£ji eviction was given. To the second British memo: (6 December 1911) stating His Majesty’s Government's case,,the Germans made no reply and presumably they accepted it. The subsequent stages were devoted to negotiations with Messrs. Wonckhaus for compensation fo» lo&gt;-~&gt; mie the interruption (consequent on the cancellation of u/ie^conc^ssion) of their free-on-board contract for purchtsing,shipping/marxeoing +.Vip mnHft mined.

'Tien told that this was out of the question they agreed to be b/ought out for a lump sum in respect of loss of prospective profit on their f.o.b. contract and loss of property. It was on this basis that the sum of £2000 (to be raised to £3000 if necessary) to be offered by His Majesty’s Government was calculated. It may be inferred therefore that Messrs. Wonckhaus had admitted that they had no claim to concessionary rights in the island; and as'His Majesty’s Government have always held that the Sheikh was perfectly within his rights in cancelling the concession of 1898, it is presumably open to him now to grant a new minliig concession to anyone he chooses, subject to British concurrence and the observance of his treaty obligations, whether Messrs. Monckhaus 1 claims are settled or not. If it is a question of e xport only, it is not evident why a concession from the Sheikh is necessary at all. Export arrangements would be made with a shipping compahy by the parties mining the oxide. If it is a question of exmortinw only such oxide alxeadyhoen dun; under the orlmlaal concession and is still lying unshipped* it seems just possible that if the matter comes ‘to Messrs. Wonckhaus 1 ears they may consider they have a grievance if such operations are permitted before their claims for loss of prospective profit over the sale i of such oxide are settled) It is not unlikely that Messrs, 'onckhaus wold1 H the original concessionaires, who presumably con.ld argue ( at least^that oxide mined by them before their concession was cancelled remains their property. It appears desirable therefore to elicit fartner information from the Government of India as to what actually is in contemplation. Meanwhile we may ascertain from Foreign Office how far the T’onck- bans negotiations did progress and their views on the question now raised by the Government of India (whatever its precise form may prove to be) vis-st-vis of Messrs.

Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received June 11.) Board of Trade, June 10, 19]4. WITH reference to your letter of the 1st April, regarding the Abu Musa oxide question, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for Sir E. Grey’s information, that they have been in consultation with Mr. Strick on the subject generally, and particularly in regard to certain points (shown in the accompanying questionnaire*, which was submitted to Mr. Strick), the determination of which appeared to them necessary before any reasonable estimate could be framed of the sum to be offered as compensation to Messrs. Wdnckhaus. The enclosed memorandum, which has been prepared in this Department, contains an account of an interview with Mr. Strick, who was accompanied by Mr. Holmes, together with certain observations on the information supplied by those gentlemen. The last three paragraphs of the memorandum contain references to points on which it was not necessary to consult Mr. Strick, but which have been included for the sake of completeness. Sir E. Grey will observe that in the light of the further information now available, the Board are disposed to think that an offer of 3,000L would not be unreasonable as a complete settlement of Messrs. Wonckhaus’s claims. I am, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting Aba Musa Oxide. Mr. Strick, accompanied by Mr. Holmes, called at this office on the 20th May ; two letters on this subject, copies of which are appended to this memorandum, had previously been received from him. In the course of this interview Mr. Strick confirmed the information contained in his letters, and further elucidated certain points. 1. Mr. Strick and Mr. Holmes again laid stress on the fact that oxide does not deteriorate by being left unprotected for long periods. Indeed, its quality is even said to improve as a result of the evaporation in such circumstances of the moisture which is present after it has been mined ; and Mr. Holmes would be prepared, if desired, to adduce expert evidence in support of this contention. As regards the admixture of wand in the “ Louise ” shipment, Mr. Strick explained that such admixture is to be attributed solely to the primitive methods of mining carried on at Abu Musa, and is not to be accounted for by exposure on the sea shore. It appears that the “ mines” are in the nature of open workings, and the practice has been to excavate the vein of oxide without regard to the overlying strata, with the conse quence that there have been frequent falls of sand and stones from the “roof” of the vein—the debris being allowed to remain mixed with the oxide or only imperfectly removed. Incidentally it may be noted that the damage to the “ mines” indicated in item (3) of the claims set out in Messrs. Wonckhaus’s letter of the 10th March, 1913, to the German Foreign Office was evidently due to these primitive methods of working, and could not, therefore, properly form the ground of a claim against His Majesty’s Government, even if they were disposed (which they are not) to recognise Messrs. Wdnckhaus as partners in the Concessionnaire Company. Mr. Strick and Mr. Holmes were accordingly emphatic in their opinion that Messrs. Wdnckhaus’s claims as regards the deterioration of the “ Louise ” shipment are wholly unfounded. Indeed they regard that shipment as a fair sample of the quality of oxide ordinarily derivable from the Abu Musa mines. 2. As regards the quantity of oxide capable of being shipped from Abu Musa in a [ 2165 G-2] Not printed. t'Vn . \ COPY TO INDIA n.-EEj-isi- 1 *.year, Mr. Strict considers that this could not exceed 2 000 tons, or the m.mmum quantity stipulated for in Messrs. Wonckhaus’s contract of 1906. Mr Holmes explained that shipping arrangements at Abu Musa are more primitive if possible than the mmmg methods themselves. There is nothing but an open roadstead and the oxide has _ apparently to be shipped from boats pushed out from the shore by nat.ves a mode off^ procedure which renders it impossible to ship more than 10 tons a day at the outside. On account of the heat prevalent during a laige part of the year and variations m weather conditions, it is not possible to allow for more than 200 days during which shipping operations can be carried on. • i &lt;? xi • + + It is apparent, therefore, that during the unexpired period of their contract two years and eight months) Messrs. Wonckhaus could not have expected to ship more than 5,500 tons of oxide. . „ . . •■ur n+n 3. It has already been stated that the “Louise shipment is believed to have represented a fair sample of average Abu Musa oxide. It is true that Messrs. Wonckhaus stipulated in their contract that the oxide should be of the same quality as the 700 tons shipped by Mr. Robert Wonckhaus ” in March, 1906 (i.e., the trial, shipment by the steamship “ Stolzenfels ”), which it is claimed was sold at an average price of 65s per ton. Mr. Strict is, however, at a loss to understand how this oxide could have been sold for more than 55s. per ton, which would be a fair price for the very best quality of oxide producible in Abu Musa, which can only be procured in extremely limited quantities from one small working. He is positive that 60 s. a ton could not have been obtained for it, unless it was sold at infrequent intervals and in very small quantities as the exigencies of demand might permit. Indeed, 65s. is the price of Hormuz oxide, which, being the finest quality on the market, is considerably superior to the best quality of Abu Musa oxide referred to above. Had a large amount of inferior oxide from Abu Musa been brought into competition with the Hormuz supply the sale price of the latter would, in Mr. Striek’s opinion have been speedily reduced, with the result that Abu Musa oxide would have been displaced, and left on Messrs. Wonckhaus’s hands. The market, it is alleged, can only absorb from 6,000 to 7,000 tons of oxide a year from all quarters. A/r , 11 The selling price of Abu Musa oxide in Germany, according to Mr. btrick, would be about 40s. a ton. Even that price could, in his opinion, only be mamtame wit difficulty, having regard especially to the length of time (over two years) which elapsed before Messrs. Wdndkiiaus were able to sell the 1810 tons which they shipped by the “ Louise”—a delay in no wise to lie accounted for by inferiority of quality ol that particular shipment, but (as has already been indicated) by the limited character ot t e market for oxide and the competition of the Hormuz output. . In the light of these statements it appears to the Board that it would e unreasonable to frame an estimate of the compensation to be paid to Messrs Wonckhaus on any other basis than the average selling price in Germany of Abu Musa oxide 40s. a ton. To take as a basis the price of 65s. a ton (that claimed by Messrs. v\ onckhaus as the selling price of the trial shipment ) or even 55s. a ton (the highest price at whic , in Mr. Strick’s view, any Abu Musa oxide could be sold in Germany, when moreover only a very small quantity of oxide of this quality is to be found on the island at a ) would seem to be extravagant. In any event, if Messrs. Wdnckhaus have any claim at all (on the strength of their contract) in respect of a higher price than 40s. a ton, such claim would appear to lie against Hassan Samaiya who led them to believe a large deposits of good quality oxide existed on the island, and not against His Majes ys Government. 0x . , , , ^ 4. As regard’s freight charges from Abu Musa to Hamburg, Mr. Strick s denm assertion is that 17s. 6d. should be allowed for this item and not 15s. the amount quoted by Messrs. Wonckhaus in respect of the trial shipment of the “ btolzenle s which has already been referred to. The statement in which among others, this item is given, formed one of the enclosures in the Foreign Office’s letter of the 14th Octobei last. Mr. Strick is prepared to accept Messrs. Wbnckhaus’s figures for the other items as a basis on which the average cost ol Abu Musa oxide c.i.f. Hamburg may e 5. The question whether, and how far the price of oxide generally would have been depressed by the addition of an annual supply of 2,000 tons of the Abu Musa produce to the world’s supply is of course somewhat intangible. Mr. Strick, however, is confident that such an appreciable depression would have occurred, that he considers it is extremely doubtful whether Messrs. Wonckhaus could possibly have carried ou their contract at a profit had it been permitted to run. Had the_ firm shippe anything like 2,000 tons a year and attempted to sell this quantity m compe i ionwith the much superior produce of the Hormuz mines, the price it could have secured would have been so low as to render the venture almost unremunerative, and Messrs. Wonckhaus would probably have had large stocks left on their hands which they could only have unloaded very gradually even at the low price obtainable. In fdhese circumstances Mr. Stuck considers it inconceivable that Messrs. Wonckhaus wouM have availed themselves of the renewal clause of their contract; indeed, financially he thinks they may deem themselves fortunate to have had their contract terminated after one year and four months of its operation. If this is anything like an accurate statement of the facts, it would seem that Messrs. Wonckhaus cannot reasonably look for compensation in respect of the renewal clause of their contract. It is now possible to estimate the amount of compensation which may be allowed to Messrs. Wonckhaus on the basis of the foregoing. The c.i.f. price per ton of Abu Musa oxide at Hamburg may be calculated as follows :— Per Ton (of 20 cwt.) Cost price f.o.b. Abu Musa as per contract .. freight—17s. 6&lt;7.—less 5 per cenr. commission Marine insurance f per cent, of 40s. Discharging . Discount 1 per cent, on sale price, 40s. Total s. d. 15 0-0 16 7*5 0 3-6 0 9-0 0 4-8 33 6-9 The average sale price being 405., the net profit per ton on this basis would be 65 . 5ygr£, or a profit of 1,713L 65 . 8 d. on the total of 5,333^ tons. That this estimate is a fair one, is illustrated by the fact that Mr. Strick considers a profit of 20 per cent, on the selling price to be excellent and more than could ordinarily be expected. The compensation allowed to Messrs. Wonckhaus on the above basis is equivalent to a profit of over 15 per cent, on the cost price. The estimate moreover takes no account of the fact that Messrs. Wonckhaus have been allowed to remove large quantities of oxide since the termination of their contract. It appears from information supplied by the Foreign Office and the India Office that, excluding two shipments of 700 tons each by the tc Stolzenfels ” and the “ Muhamm ’’ which were made in March 1906 (i.e., before the commencement of the contract) and excluding also a shipment of 400 tons in May 1910, by the “ Nasiri ” apparently for Hassan s account, the shipments of oxide made by Messrs. Wonckhaus since the commencement of this contract were as follows :— Date. Vessel. Quantity. June 2, 1907.. “ Nasiri ” . . Tons. 300 July 16, 1907 “ Tentonia ” 500 (? 900) April, 1908 .. “ Louise ”. . 1,810 May, 1911 .. : (?) 300 November 14, 1912 (?) 300 Total .. 3,210 (? 3,610) At least 3,210 tons were, therefore, shipped by the firm since the commencement of their contract, of which no less than 2,410 tons were shipped after the termination of the contract in pursuance of His Majesty’s Government’s permission. Lastly, there remains the question of the amount which should reasonably be allowed to Messrs, Wonckhaus in settlement of their direct losses, viz.; in respect of advances to the mining company and of implements lost on the island (see paragraph 3 of the Board s letter of the 9th January). As regards advances to the mining company the Board note from the memorandum of Sir P. Cox, copy of which was enclosed with the Foreign Office’s letter of the 10 th February that, according to Hassan’s statements, these amounted to only 2,000 rupees. It appears further that the amount of compensation to be allowed for implements—comprising apparently some buckets and planks left on the island—is extremely small. According to a telegram from His Majesty’s residency at Bushire, copy of which was communicated to the Board by the India Office, the planks which were the property of the Hamburg-4 Amerika Line and left on the island by the steamship “ L°mse,” were valued at 41. each.* It would appear, therefore, that a round sum of loOl. should cover claims under both heads. . „ i* In view of all the considerations set out m the preceding paragraphs a sum of 1 863Z 6 s. 8 d. or in round figures 2,000Z.—might not uEreasonabiy be onered to- Messrs Wonckhaus in settlement of all their claims. Nevertheless, as an act of grace and to crive Messrs. Wonckhaus the most complete satisfaction, the Board are disposed to suggest that this sum might be raised to 3,0001. This would assume a selling price for Abu Musa oxide of little short of 45s. a ton—a price which according to the acts set out above, Abu Musa oxide, if sold in considerable quantities could nevei have realised; and it would assume an average net profit per ton of over 30 per cent, on the cost price, as compared with Mr. Strick’s outside estimate of 20 per cent.

Mr. Stride and Mr. Heines a min laid stress on the fact that oxide does not deteriorate by being left unpro tected for long periods. Indeed, its quality is even said to improve as a result of the evaporation in such circum stances of the moisture vMch is present after it has been S mined: and Mr. Holmes would h&gt; prepared, if desired, to adduce expert evidence in support of this contention.

Incidentally it may be noted that the damage to the 'mines* indicated in item (3) of the claims set out in Messrs. Wonckhaus 1 b letter9 latter of the lOtiu March, 1915, to the Gorman Foreif?! Office, Wfc,s evidently due to these priaitite methods of working, and could not, therefore, properly form the ground of a claim against His Majesty's Govermaent, even if they were disposed (chich they are not) to recognise Messrs. ToiiqMisa.s as partners in the Concessionaire Company. Mr. Striok and Mr. Holmes were accordingly anphatic in their opinion that Messrs. Wonckhaus's claims as regards the deterioration of the 'Louise” shipment are wholly un founded. Indeed they regard that shipment as a fair sample of the quality of o.dde ordinarily deriveable from the Abu Musa mines. ( 2 ). As regards the quantity of oxide capable of being shipped from Abu ;*usa in a year 1 , Mr. Stride considers th,at this could not exceed .,000 tens, or the minimum i quantity stipulated for in Messrs, fonckhaus's contract of 1906. Mr. Holmes explained that shipping arrangements at Abu Musa are more primitive, if possible, than the mining methods themselves. There is nothing but an open roadstead and the oxide n&amp;s apparently to bo shijjpod from boats pushed out from the shore by natives, a mode of pro cedure which renders it impossible to ship more than 10 tons a day at the outside. On account of the heat preval ent during a largo part of the year, and variations in weather conditions, It is not possible to allow for more than 200 days during which shipping operations can be carried on. It is apparent therefore that during the unexpired period of their contract (2 years and 8 months) Mesars.Uossra. ^onckhaus could not havu ox- octod to ship more than 5,500 tonn of oxida. (5), It has already bean stated that the •Louis©' shipment is bsliaved to hairo roprosentsd a fail' sample of airorage A'bu Musa oxide. It is iruo that tlassrs. Wonckiiaus stipulated in their contract that the oxide should bo of tha 'same Reality an the 700 tons shipped by Mr. Robert fbnekhaus* in March 1906 the trial shipment by tho S.S. 'Stolsanfelo'), idiich it is claimed was sold at an average price of 65/- per ton. Mr. Strick is, however, at a less to understand how this oxid could have been sold for mere than 55/- per ton, which weld bo a fair price for tho very beet quality of oxide producible in Abgr Musa which can only be procured in oxtremly limited quantities from one small working* He in positive that of)/- a ton could not have bean obtained for it, unlyoa it was sold at infrequent inter vals mC in ve- jsimll quantities as the exigencies of demand might permit. Indeed 65/- is the price of Ilcrmus oxide, w 1 icli bai/pg the finest quality on the market, is consider ally superior to tho best qual ity of Abu Musa oxide referred to above. Had a largo amount of inferior oxide fror Abu Musa been brought into competition with the Horans supply tho sale price of the latter would, in Mr* Strick’e opinion, have been speedily reduced, with the result that Abu Musa oxide would have boon displaced and left on *1*0 Bsr?,. WcncfchauB’s hands. The mark at,' it is alleged, can only absorb from 6,000 to 7,0007,000 tons of oxide a year from all quarters. Th-a selling price of 4bu Musa Oxide in Oemany, accord ing to Mr. Sirick, would be about 40/- a ton. Even that price could, in Ms opinion, only be maintained with diffic ulty, haying regard especially to the length of time (over two yrars) which elapsed before Messrs. Wenckh&amp;us were able to sell the 1810 tons which they shipped by the * Louise* - a delay in no wise to be accounted for by inferiority of quality of that particular shipment, but fas has already been indicated) by the limited character of the market for oxide and the competition of the Hormuz output. In the light of these statemontes it appears to the Board that it would be unreasonable to frame an estimate of the compensation to be paid to Messrs. Wonckhaus on any other basic than the average selling price in Germany of Abu Musa oxide - 40/- a ton. To take as a basis the price of 6f?/- a ton (that claimed by Messrs. ¥cnckhaus as the selling price of the trial shipment) or oven 55,/- a ton (the highest price at wiiich - in Mr. Shriek's vie^ - any Abu Musa oxide cor Id be noU in (Germany, when moreover only a very mvll quantity of oxide of this quality is to bo found on the island at all) would seam to be extravagant. In any event, if Messrs. Wcnokhaus have any claim at all (or the strength of their contract) in respect of a higher price than 40/- a ten, mob claim would appear to lie against Fens&amp;n Semedyn who led tb.or. to believe that large deposits of good quality oxide existed on the island, and not against His Majesty's OoVermont. (4). As regards freight charges from Abu Musa to HamburgKapbiirg, Lr* Btriok’e anaerticn is that 17s. 6d. should bo allowed lor tide item and not 15 b# the amount ^i-olou by Mesers# ?/onckhauB in re spool of the trial shipment ol the 'Stoleenfals* which has already boon referred to. The statement in which amor/: others, this .item ia given, formed one of the enclosures in the Foreign Office's letter of the 14th* October last (He.46,093)# Mr. Shriek is prepared lc accept Messrs-# Wonckhaus• s fibres for the other items as a lasis on which the ave 'ago cost of Abu Musa Oxide c#iJBj Hamburg may be calculated. (5). The onestion whether, snd how far the price of oxide generally would have boon deuraBsed by 'lie addition of an manual supply of £*000 tons of the Abu Musa produce to j world* S supply is of sour so ‘someAat intangible. Mr. Strict however, is ccnfidont that such an appreciable depression would hove occurred, that he corur.ders it is extremely doubtful Aether Messrs. Ffcnckliaua cot id possibly have carried out their contract at a profit had it been permitted to run. '.kd the fim ijhip;ed anything like 2,000 tons a year and attempted to sell this quantity in cos^ev&gt;it&gt;ion with uhe much superior produce of the Hormuz mines, the prxo-e it cot ;ld havowould irr/e been so low as to rondor the vontui'c^uiu'-araiuierativu, and Messrs. Wonokhans would probably have had large stocks left on their hands which they could only have unloaded very grad ually even at the Icr price ocuninuble. In these circim- ctmices fr* Strick considers it inconceivable that Messrs# Wonckh&amp;us would have availed themsolvos oi the renewal clause of their contract: indeed financially he thinks ' theythey may deem themselves fortunate to have had their cen tre .ct terminated after 1 year and 4 months of its operation* If this is anything like an accurate statement of the facts, it wo Id seem that Messrs* Wonckhaus cannot reasonably look for compensation in respect of the renewal clause of their contract. It is now possible to estimate the amount of compensat ion which may be allowed to Messrs. Wonckhaus on the basis of the foregoing* The C.I.F* price per ton of Abu Musa Oxide at Hamburg may be calculated as follows:- Cost price f.o.b. Abu Musa as er contract.«...•*•«...»«««*. a. 15. d. • 6 0. per ton (of 20 cwt) Freight - 17/6d- less ^ commission. * 16. 7'5. * 9 9 Marine Insurance $ of 40/» 3' 6 11 9 9 1 Discharging 9’0 • 9 it Discount X* on sale price, 40/- 4'8 ' 9 II 33. 6’9. * 9 9 The average sale price being 40/-, the net profit per ton on this basis would be 6s. 5 y d. - or a profit of £1,713. 6. 8. on a total of 5 # 333| tons. That this estimate is a fair one, is illustrated by the fact that Mr. Strick considers a profit of 2Q on the selling price to be excellent and more than could ordinarily v be expected. The compensation allowed to Messrs. Wonckhaus on the above basis is equivalent to a profit of over IfJ on the cost price. The estimate moreover takes no account of the fact thatthat LI©ears* Wonckliaus hav© ba©n allowud to removo lar^s quantities of oxide since the termination of their contract. It appears from information supplied by the Foreign Office and the India Office that, excluding two shipments of 700 tone each by the 'Stolzenfols* and the 'IMiamm' which were made in March 1906 (i,e*, before the commencement of the contract) and excluding also a shipment of 400 tons in May 1910, by tho 'Hasir! 11 apparently for Hasson's account, the shipments of oxide made by Messrs. Wonckhaus since the commencement of this contract v/ere as follows:- Bate. Yessel. Quantity. June 2, 1907. Hasiri. tons. 300. July 16, 1907. Tentonia. 500 (7900) April, 1908. Louise. 1,810. May, 1911. ? 300. Hov.14, 1912. 9 • 500. 3,210.(?3,610). At least 5,210 tons were, therefore, shipped by the firm since the cornnencement of their contract, of which no less then 2,410 tons were shipped after the termination of the contract in pursuance of His Majesty’s G-overnment’s permission. Lastly there remains the question of the amount v/hich should reasonably be allowed to Messrs. Wonckhaus in settlement of their direct losses, vis; in respect of advances to the Mining Company and of implements lost on thethe island (see Paragraph 3 of the Boards letter of the 9th* January -0*8636/13)* As regards advances to the mining company the Board note from the Memorandum of Sir P. Cox, copy of which was enclosed with the Foreign Office letter of the 10th. February (Nq* 5706) that, according to Hasaan's statements, these amounted to only 2,000 rupees* It appears further that the amount of compensation to be allowed for implements - comprising apparently some buckets and planks left on the island - is extremely small According to a telegram from His Majesty^ Residency at Bushire, copy of which was communicated to the Board by the India Office, the planks which were the property of the Hamburg-Amerika Bine and left on the island by the S.S. ,, Louis8 ,, , were valued at £4 each. It would appear, therefore, that a round sum of £150 should cover claims under both heads. In view of all the considerations set out in the preceding paragraphs a sum of £1,863. 6. 8. - or in round figures £2,000 - might not unreasonably be offered to Messrs* ^onckhaus in settlement of all their claims. Nevertheless, as an act of grace and to give Messrs. Wonckhaus the most complete satisfaction, the Board are disposed to suggest that this sum might be raised to £3,000. This would assume a selling price for Abu Musa Oxide of little short of 45/- a ton - a price which accord ing to the facts set out above, Abu Musa oxide, if sold in considerable quantities - could never have realised; and it would assume an average net profit per ton of overover 3Q ; on the cost price, as compared with Mr* Stride*s j^utside estimate of 2(|S.

I % * ROUGH DRAFT OF PROPOSED REPLIES TO THE BOARD OF TRADE QUERIES RE ABU MUSA. FIRST SERIES. 1. Our experience ia that Red Oxide does not deterior ate if left lying unprotected for six months close to the shore avraiting shipment. The Oxide at Ormuz ia often waiting for six months and longer under similar conditions without any apparent depreciation. 2. As to the probable output of the Abu Musa mines, it is somewhat difficult to give any reliable information, • but, judging from the report ?Mch we received from the Comnander of one of our ships who visited the island in June 1909, and vdio carefully examined all the workings there* we fire of opinion that, with the primitive methods then employed both in the mining and transport of the mineral, the average output of good Oxide per day was unlikely to exceed 10 tons, or say, on the basis of 200 possible work ing days per annum, 2&gt;000 tons. Further, owing to the unskilled mining methods employed, a fall had occurred sane time prior to June, 1909, in one part of the face of the mine, and there was a danger of a further fall in another part of the same mine. If this had happened, work might have been completely stopped at the mine from which the best quality was worked. 3. The quality of Abu Musa Oxide has hitherto varied considerably.considerably* In 1898 we imported a parcel of about 47( by our s.s* ' Irabistan' , the quality of v/hich mM very poor compared to Ormuz, and it took us about four years to sell it, the prices obtained averaging about IQs * per ton ex store. Towards the end, owing to the competition of Spanish Oxides, we had to sell about 146 tons at the equivalent of 25s. ex store. Another shipment, arranged by Messrs. J. C. P. Hots h Son, came forward by the ' Sigrid'. and was sold at a very low figure in London, we believe at less than 25s* C.I.F., from which we infer that the quality of that lot must have boon, if anything, inferior to our *Arabistan ,, mM parcel. Some time later, in 1906, Haji Husseinbin Ali Sum- aya sold about 700 tons to the do mans, which was shipped | to Hamburg, after transhipment at Karachi. This proved to be r?| of good quality, and, we believe, realised about 55s. per 1 )■ ton O.I.F. Hamburg, which, at that time, ms about 10s. below the price of Ormuz standard quality. In April, 1908, the p; Gemaas loaded a parcel of about 1,800 by the s.s. ' Louise* * which was much inferior to the 700 tons above mentioned, jJ but rather better than our ' Arabiatan' quality. This ship- f J | rnent did not find favour in Germany, and we know for certain i ; that, in February, 1910, Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co^s. Igants ware offaring it in lots of 300 tons at 48a . dalivar- | ed CJLF. !'?9TOaBtle-on»T-ma or South Walaa . To arrive at I i the price, in Hamburg, at least 5a. ahordd be deducted from - | i the C.I.F. quotation, bringing the ex store price at that ]' I port dovm to 43a., or say 12s. par ton lass than the C.I.F. j ^5 value of tha 700 tons first imported by the Germans. In mand sold at prices varying between 40s. and 30s. ex store, and as low as 26s. direct ex ship. It was vary difficult to sell, and it took us about U years to clear the parcel. Generally speaking, our anav/er to the question would bo tliao uhs quality of Abu Musa Oxide is decidedly irregular. Undoubtedly there is good mineral to be had from one of the mines, but the quality of shipments has varied considerably- principally owing to the unscientific way in which it is worked. SECOND SERIES 1* In replying to the (.question as to the annual cost per ton for freight, insurance t and commission , during the years 190?/l912, it is rather difficult to give exact figures, seeing that we only carried one parcel during that period, i*e« that per ' Gulistan* , on which we had a special rate of freight of 15s .» but, taking a line from the rates ruling from Ormus during these years, we estimate that Abu Musa freights would h:ve been as follows:- 1907 17/6 for the first nine months of year % then 15/6 to end of year. 1908 17/6 1909 17/6 1910 17/6 1911/12 20s. The cost of Insurance we should put at about #o, while, as to commission it is probable that Trauen, Sturken ?t Co., who acted as agents for tbnckhaua \ Co. would not have workedworked for loss tlmn 2% . 2. With regard to the a?erago price of Abu Musa Oxide in Germany during the above years, it ia extremely hard for us to speak with any degree of accuracy, but we have reason to believe that they commenced selling the ' Louise' shipment at about 50s. . and, as mentioned above, we know they come down to the equivalent of 45s. ex store, so wa should estimate that 45s. ex store would be about the average price obtained. After deducting 5s. for landing charges, interest, rent, etc., the price is brought down to the equivalent of 40s. G.I.F. Hamburg . 3, In reply to the question whether the addition of Abu Musa Oxide would have depressed prices on the World’s Oxide markets, and, if so, to what extent, the answer is that the appearance on the market of a new Bed Oxide v/o- Id undoubtedly affect prices adversely, but, as to what extent they would have been so affected, would have depended entirely upon the supplies of Aby Musa Oxide that were put on the market. Seeing that it took the Germans about two voars to sell the 1.800 tons par ' Louise' at prices which were continually on the decline, it may be reasonably inferred that, if the shipments of Abu Musa had been at the rate of 2 T 00Q tons per annum, or more, of the sane quality as the 'Louise', it would probably have resulted in a large accumulation of stocks, which could not have been sold, unless sacrificed at extremely low prices, fhe World’s demand for Red Oxide is very limited, and, whenever | the supply is increased from nevr sources, it go isrally meansmoans that, if the new Bed is good enough, and relatively cheap, it tdcao the place of some inferior quality* If the quality of Abu Musa could have boon maintained equal to the first parcel imported by the Crormans, it would probably have interfered with the demand for Ormus, but, if the quality were only about equal to that imported by the ' Louise* , ' Arab!stan *, and ' (k-JLlslan *, it would then have come into competition with the Spanish Oxides , and the Onidee mined in this country, and, to successfully compete with these, it would have to be sold at a, very low price,FRANK 0.

They are a most correct average of tbs rualities in the various mines, and have been obtained by self and Chief Engineer. IIIIIE !Io. 1. This mine is crescent shape, with concavity to southward. The entire face is vertical at an irregular height of 60 feet, and 300 feet from horn to horn. The drift dips at an angle of 50° towards the face and is irregular. The veins of Oxide are about 20 feet thick, and the best oxide seems to be on the West or right hand side of the Mine. The left side is dangerous by reason of over hanging Rook and earth, but there is plenty of oxide there. I should say this wtyld be the place w |!ere the fall had Op-v to £nd;a occurred, 24 JUL1914 foccurred, mentioned in Major Cox’s advices. The mine cert ainly wants clearing of drift end rubbish. There should also be made four good paths for transporting Oxide from the workings to minehead. A large quantity of top earth and rock will have to be removed before more oxide is worked out, otherwise there will be a loss of good oxide, and what is got will be mixed with stones. In my opinion, this is the best mine on the island, and has boon worked very badly for what is practically a surface mine or quarry. There is a stock of about lf)0 tone at minehead for trans porting to shipping place. TTihCPORT . This is very indifferent and v/ill have to be improved unless huge stocks of oxide are accumulated before steamers are sent here. There are two carts, supplied* I understand, by Major Cox. They are of fair sice and easily worked by one ox each cart. Four mere of the same size could do good work, about one ton each journey.

Translation of a Note by the Residency Agent at Lingeh. (Enclosure in denn-ojjicial tetter from Resident, Bushire, dated 10t/i May 1914:.) The Abu Musa Question. As to the fact that the exalted British Government refuse to recognise Wonckhaus as a member of the company of concessionnaires or to discuss any claims based on that pretention, this is most advisable, because Wonckhaus’ contract with Hassan bin Somaiyah was only for this purpose that when Wonckhaus sent any steamers for the shipment of oxide, Hassan bin Somaiyah should deliver the stuff f. o. b. by his own lighters ; and Wonckhaus has absolutely no right to interfere with the shore and the mines. As regards the intention (a) to pay direct losses ; ( 6 ) to pay a lump sum for the loss of work occasioned to them. In connection with (a), the remarks made by the Honourable Sir Percy Cox are correct. In addition to them, I deem it incumbent upon me to represent those facts of which I am well aware. Hassan bin Somaiyah’s allegation for the loss of certain articles on the island has been made at the instigation of the members of the firm of Wonckhaus, so that the latter may obtain the means of interfering with this question, and supporting the unfounded claim of Hassan bin Somaiyah. It is obvious that Wonckhaus had absolutely no right to interfere with the internal affairs of the island and the working of the oxide mines, so that he may possess any implements on the island. At the time when the exalted British Government gave permission for the shipment of oxide by the S.S. Louise, I was commissioned to the Abu Musa island to supervise all the matters connected with this affair. There were four iron measuring-buckets on the island, two of them being large and the others a little smaller ; and these were intended to be used in weighing oxide on board the Louise to ascertain the quantity shipped. When the shipment of oxide was finished, I desired to weigh (the contents of each of) those buckets on board the Louise, and Hassan bin Somaiyah agreed to this in the beginning, but when we were about to weigh them, he disagreed at the instigation of the manager of the firm of Wonckhaus and Mirza Husain the dragoman, who were on board the steamer, and replied that they would have them weighed at Lingeh. Two of the four buckets, one large and the other small, were brought by them to Lingeh by the Louise, but they again disagreed to have them weighed at Lingeh, and they (therefore) only estimated the weight of the oxide shipped by the Louise. The other two measuring buckets which remained on the island formed parts of the articles delivered by me to Hassan bin Somaiyah when the gears were brought to Lingeh from the island—for which I obtained a receipt dated the 12th Safar 1331 = 20th January 1913, from Hassan bin Somaiyah, the original of which exists in the Bushire Residency. In the course of the S. 243.l V .V k I b \ , ij; ' 1 If i- : f 1 1 ■ I l • ' shipment of oxide by the S.S. Louise, four planks of wood were used as landings to facilitate the shipment of oxide by the lighters, and when the articles were brought over to Lingeh from the island, 1 delivered three of the four planks to Hassan bin Somaiyah. and took a receipt dated 4th Rabi-ul- Awwal 1331 —11th February 1913 from him which is available in the Bushire Residency. The remaining one of the four planks was removed from the island by a certain Muhammad bin Fahad, by order and permission of llassan bin Somaiyah; and if the latter denies this, it would be possible to demand the same from Muhammad bin Fahad. The value of each plank may amount to Rs. 20 at the most. In the face of these facts, and of the existence of receipts, there is no necessity to make any reference to Hassan bin Somaiyah : s account books, which have been cooked by the members ot‘ the firm of Wonckhaus since the cancellation of the concession, and which continue to remain in the said firm up to now. Under these circumstances, how do the British Government agree to pa)* compensation for such articles which have been taken over by Hassan bin Somaiyah and for which he has passed receipts v With reference to the question of the deterioration of oxide, the facts are as stated by the Hon. Sir Percy Cox. The works on the oxide mines in this Gulf began with the Hormuz island and then with the island of Abu Musa, and the system of work is this : Any quantity of oxide excavated from the mines is collected in heaps without being stored in godowns or covered with anything. It remains under the sun, moisture, dew, rain, and air for years, and undergoes no change at all, because the margins of the heaps are so hardened by dew and moisture in the beginning that the air does not affect it at all, and it remains preserved. As regards the explanation given by the Honourable Sir Percy Cox regarding the original concessionnaires, it is the true position (of the case), and I beg to represent the information 1 possess in this connection. While negotiating the contract with Hassan bin Somaiyah, Wonckhaus proceeded to the island and approved of some oxide, but, in point of fact, the oxide excavated since the date of the contract (June 1906) which was made by Hassan bin Somaiyah with Wonckhaus up to the date when the Shaikh of Sharjah cancelled the concession, was not over 500 tons approximately ; and this was also shipped in the course of the shipments made by the S.S. Teutonia and Louise, because it was Hassan bin Somaiyah’s principal object anu desire to get rid of those heaps of oxide remaining on the island which had been excavated five lo six years before the contract of June 1906. As a matter of fact tne oxide remaining on the island is the remainder of the former heaps which had been mined within the aforesaid period before the contract of June 1906. Portions of these heaps were shipped by the steamers enumerated below and the remainder exists there. It is certain that there is no oxide on the Abu Musa island which had been especially mined for Wonckhaus. In regard to the doubtful points contained in paragraph 9, according to the records and copies of the Agency reports which had been submitted to the Residency at the time of shipments, the following shipments have been made:— On the -5tli March 1906, before Hassan bin Somaiyah’s contract with A\ onckhaus, the S.S. Muhammadi, of the Bombay and Persia SteamK:r: r sxs. shipped 700 toiis which were - 0 W? (I '!’' Ue l9&lt;)7 ’ NCUSeri ' ° f the ^bay-Persia Steam Navigation Company, shipped 6,000 bags = 300 tons of oxide which were transhipped at Bombay for Hamburg. On the 16th July 1907, the S.S. Teutonia, oi the Hamburg-Amerika Lme, shipped 900 tons for Hamburg. This ship was lost with the On the 9th-16th April 1908, the S.S. of the Hamburg-A.nerika Jjine, shipped 1,81() tons for Hamburg. It becomes clear from the shipment made by S.S. Uuhammadi that the oxi e available on the Abu Musa island had not been mined specially for oncthaus, and also that most of the oxide shipped by S.S. Teutonia and Louise was from the heaps mined before the contract of June 1906 concluded by Hassan with Wonckhaus. From the date of the contract made m June 1906 up to the date of the cancellation of the concession by e Shaikh of Sharjah, only the aforesaid quantity of about 500 tons had been mined and shipped in the course of the shipments made by b.fe. leutoma and Louise as 1 have represented above. In connection with (b) regarding the payment of a lump sum for the loss of work occasioned to them, I am unable to represent anything as I am not aware of the facts concerning the payment of compensation ; but leg to state the information 1 have obtained in regard to the arrange ment between Hassan bin Somaiyah and Wonckhaus. It was this Whenever Wonckhaus contemplated to ship oxide, Hassan bin Somaiyah used to take from him a sufficient sum for the expenses of the coolies and the lighters, and they used to settle the account of the value of oxide with out delay as soon as they finished shipment, and left no account to remain pending between them. In regard to the question dealt with in the Note, I beg to represent certain facts below, so that you may include the same if you deem it fit to do so. With regard to the original eoncessionnaires. As the original concession obtained by Hassan bin Somaiyah from the Shaikh of Sharjah in 1898 was not based on the laws of the Shar’a (legal) or the “ Urfi ” (civil) Courts, which are the basis for all commercial and other transactions in this Gulf, local difficulties arose for the Shaikh of Sharjah, and the latter cancelled the’ concession under these circumstances. In the same way that the aforesaid Courts considered the Shaikh, of Sharjah justified in this, it follows that the contract made by Hassan bin Somaiyah with Wonckhaus in June 1906 is of the same nature (as the original concession, and must be treated as such). At the time when the Shaikh of Sharjah gave the notice of cancellation to Hassan bin Somaiyah &amp; Co., the oxide remaining on the island was the right of the Shaikh of Sharjah and the concessionnaires had no title whatever therein. As the original concession was not in conformity with the current laws, it was null and void from the beginning. If the Shaikh of Sharjah’s cancellation of the concession held by Hassan bin Somaiyah &amp; Co. was without any justification, the concessionnaires would have had some wav to dispute it. It is understood from the Note that Wonckhaus claims that Hassan bin Somaiyah used specially to mine 2,000 tons oxide per annum and to prepareit for shipment, and that there was a good price for the stuff in market, and that Wonekhaus has incurred a loss owing to the prohibition. To answer Wonckhaus’ claim. From the date of the contract made m June 1900 by Hassan bin Somaiyah with Wonckhaus up to the 16th July 1907, has been a period of 13£ months, and there was no obstacle, in any way, during this period for Hassan bin Somaiyah and Wonckhaus. In the course of that time they shipped only two consignments-one of 300 tons by the S.S. Naseri on the 2nd June 1907, the whole of which was from the oxide mined 5—6 years before the contract of June 1906, and the other of 900 tons by the S.S. Teutonia on the 16th July 1907, most of which was from the oxide mined 5-6 years prior to the contract of June 1906 and some of which was from the oxide excavated in the course of the said contract as 1 have stated above, and nothing more was shipped. Had there been any truth in his claim, how could he be satisfied with these two consignments? It is clear that neither Hassau bin Somaiyah could have mined and prepared that quantity nor was the stuff in demand. When Wonckhaus shipped those two consignments, he had other objects and intentions. Further, it is certain that, both these two consignments were from out of the former heaps as has been stated above. Under these circumstances, how can it be admitted that Wonckhaus required 2,000 tons oxide per annum and that there was a good market for the stuff, and further that he could have been supplied and Hassan bin Somaiyah could have mined and prepared (that quantity) ?' Had this been the case, why did Wonckhaus not take 2,000 tons of oxide from Hassan bin Somaiyah during the 13J months when there was nothing to prevent both parties? This point fully explains the nature of the said claim. If the exalted British Government intend to settle the case by paying Wonckhaus a certain sum with a view to preventing the matter to drag on for a long time and putting a stop to Wonckhaus’ interference with this question, it woidd be good, if the sum is not great.rj 11 From Viceroy, 1st May 1914. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 9th February. Abu Musa. Following is translated extract from a letter addressed by Esa Bin Abdul Latif to Resident on 20th February 1908, and seems of some importance :— It is now ten years that this lease has been current, and during this period Haji Hassin Bin Ali Somaiyah has excavated much of the oxide from the mine on Abu Musa Island, and he is constantly accumulating the stuff there so that oxide may be ready for sale when a buyer is forthcoming. Hence I presume he has sold probably a quantity of 8,000’tons of oxide since the beginning up to now, and it is likely that there is on the island a quantity of 6,000 tons or more which has been excavated from the mine a long time ago, and a part of this consists of the quantity which, as 1 stated above, has been brought to the seashore for shipment in German steamer. I have continually demanded an account from, him, but have not received it.” See also Esa’s statement of the same date, forwarded with Secretary’s letter No. 12 M., dated 19th March 1908.

Statement made by Hassan Samaiyeh in answer to Residents enquiries made in the presence of the Residency Agent at Lingah and Khan Sahib Haji Abdur Rezak of the Bushire Residency. Lingali&gt; 27th August 1913. Hassan Samaiyeh states under examination :— I took an advance of Its. 2,000 from Messrs. Wonckhaus in the first ins tance. Ihe item was debited against me in my general running account with them. I do not remember informing my partners at Shargah of having taken this advance. I have shipped oxide for Messrs. Wonckhaus 3 or 4 times. Our account is not finally balanced up, but there is little or nothing outstanding on either side, there may possibly be something very inconsiderable due from me. I began excavating oxide the same year I got the concession and used to keep about 50 coolies working from time to time. I have shipped alto gether, I suppose, about 20,000 tons. I have not yet rendered anv account of this to Esa bin Abdul Latif. My custom was to have a small gang of coolies permanently working and collecting oxide so as to have it ready for shipment on receipt of an order. It has never been my custom to put anything over the oxide as a protec tion, for this reason that the first night’s dew is sufficient to form a hard crust over it which preserves the contents from all weather. I have kept it a year or more lying there without deterioration. My contract with Wonckhaus was merely to deliver oxide f. o. b. He had no concern with my preparations. I should be prepared to start regular excavation of oxide for shipment, as hitherto, in two months from time of warning. Hitherto I have never employed more than 60 or 70 men and the digging space is limited. If it were desired to employ more men the width of the excavated space must be increased. Before me.

The German Embassy v/ould he grateful to learn when a settlement of these matters may be expected.

( yu^L^s o F-&lt; V I beg to offer some comment based on local knowledge on details of the Board Of Trade letter of January 9th to the Foreign Office. His Majesty’s Government start with the premise that Gney refuse to recognise Messrs. Y/onckhaus as members of the Concessionnaire Company, or discuss any claim based on that pretence. The contract entered into by Wonckhaus with the Concessionnaires merely provided for his obtaining oxide ”f.o.b.' on ships sent by him to fetch it. This is the only position we need recognise. We contemplate (a) Refunding direct losses. (b) Paying a lump sum for loss of business resulting according to Hassan’s statements only amount to 2,000 rupees. (2) What was first interpreted as 'depos its” on the island, is now corrected to'objects', i.e. implements which are said to have disappeared from the I should like to offer some explanation on this point. Hassan Samaiyeh at the time of the cancellation of the concession by the Sheikh of ShargaXwas warned to remove his coolies and gear from the island at a certain date. He neglected to do so within the time specified, and was then warned that if he did not do so they would be removed for him. He refused to comply and everything was therefore put on lighters and transported to Lingah ■ where Kassan was told that he could take or leave the to them. Doard of Trade para, c) (1) As regards claim (a) (1) the advances island. stuffstuff as he pleased, and that no claim could be enter al tained in regard to it. He then took it. Subsequently when he was allowed by us to ship some of the accumulated oxide for Wonckhaus he took some gear otic^ aAain, and between shipments, the roof of his locker store/fell in, and the islanders were said to have removed a few things. Hassan Samaiyeh then at Wonckhaus’s instig ation put in an extravagant claim, which included things which he said he had lost when his gear was thrown out of the island under the circumstances above-mentioned. The German firm first claimed that the gear was partly owned by them as members of the concession, but this claim was not recognised. They were told that seeing that Wonckhaus contract was 'f.o.b.” and that he had himself stated publicly in a letter to the*press that ’’there never were any goods of ours on the island' 5^ Letter to London ’’Standard' dated 17th he could really have no December 1908, referred to in Bushire Residency Letter da,ted title to make such a claim, 12th January 1908 (?19G9) to Government of India. but as he stated that some landings, planks, and 3 or 4 iron buckets belonging to a Hamburg-Amerika ship had been left there, we contemplated paying them the value of these, if their presence there could be proved. My opinion therefore is that we should refuse to consider their right to identity themselves with Hassan Samaiyeh’s claim for the concessionnaire’s ordinary loading gear (bags, crow-bars, &amp;c.), but that we should refund him the small amount due for the few articles above mentioned without further question. It should be a very small amount. The l ist and value is o n record at Bushire, and I do not think it would be worth while bothering about the evidence. To prove it wouldwould mean the Resident proceeding to Abu Musa or Shargah to hold a further court and involve expenditure of coal amounting to more than the value of the things. Any investigation requiring the evidence of Hassan Samaiyeh’s account books would be very unsatisfactory, as no accounts have ever been shown by him to his partners and we know that he cooked his books under Mr. Brown’s directions after the cancellation of the concession and they have since been in German keeping. (Para. 4 of Board of Trade letter). The question of deterioration is a difficult one. From the history of the oxide trade I believe the claim on this account to be in a great measure mythical. In the Board of Trade letter the local conditions existing at the time of the execution of the Wonckhaus contract do not seem to be quite understood * I beg to offer some explanations. The original Concess- ionnaires obtained their concession in 1898 (?). They started regularly mining oxide a few months later, and their plan of operations was to keep about 50 coolies on the island extracting the oxide in a leisurely way and accumulating heaps of it with which to fulfil orders when received. At the time Wonckhaus was contemplating taking up the oxide trade (1906) and making a contract with Hassan Samaiyeh (in 1906, seven years after the work had been going on), the first thing he did was to visit the island and examine the several heaps of oxide lying ready for disposal (at least three different spots had been worked). After examining the heaps, which had probably been there for years, he entered intoneontract to buy the oxide f.o.b. (June 1906). It xvas in August 1906 that we heard of it, and in February 190? that the Sheikh of Shargah cancelled the concession. To the best@&gt; of my belief very little if any mining went on after August 1906, and none especially for Wonckhaus. Hassen simply continued to keep his footing there with a few diggers until he was expelled in October 1907. The G-ermans in their case Quoted 'The fact that the Company is not in a position to extract at the proper time the quantity which they must keep ready for deliveries due i n the c orni ng month s '. It is to be remembered that during the years 1899 to 1906 Eassan had been mining small quantities all the time but had sold very little, and that to India: at ana that/the time his concession was cancelled there was oxide on the island which w r e now know' fairly accur ately to have amoaneedl to 5000 tons odd. None of that was mined after the cancellation of the Concession. (Oct. 1907) and to the best of my belief, oa.sed on experience of the normal working of the concerm not more than 500 tons was mined between June 1906 and October 1907. With reference therefore to jiaxa. the doubtful points raised in para. 9, (1) to the best of my recollection no shipment was made for Wonckhaus before the 'Louise' shipment. This can be verified at once from the Bushire record if it is not on record here. (2) To the best of my belief hearly the whole, and in any case the major proportion, of the oxide lying on the island at the moment of the concession being .cancelled had been mined before the com menceraent of Wonckhaus ! s contract; and between the commencement of Wonchhaus ? s contract (June 1906) and the cancellation of the Concession, not more than 500 tons was mined. I v/ould lay stress on the fact that we allowed Wonckhaus to carry■ ► f^A carry a,way the mined oxide in spite of protests from the Sheikh of ohar^ah and the other concessionnaires, primaliljs beca.use His Majesty 1 s G-overnment seemed to have understood at the time that it had been mined for wonckhaus - which it had not-, but mainly for the speciiic object of discountii^ Wonckhaus’s claim for loss of business. As a favour we resigned the whole of the 5210 tons on the island to Wonckhaus, so that he might not have the pretext that he had been put to loss. In my opinion, having regard to the normal scale on which the mining was always carried on up to the time of Wonckhaus f s contract, &amp;nd which scale Wonckhaus showed no inclination to (get) modify, Hassan Samaiyeh could not have mined more than, and with great difficulty as much as, 2000 tons per year; Wonckhaus merely stated a maximum of 5000 tons in order to rake quite sufce that Hassan should have none to spare for anyone else. Let us presume that he could have taken 2000 tons per year - from June 1906 to June 1912 - 7 years. Then he would have taken 14,000 tons* In point of fact we have given him the opportunity of taking 5000 odd tons, so he may conceivably have lost the sale of 9,000 tons if there w as a mar ket , but it is very doubtful if there was one. This figure is much the same as that at which the Board of Trade arrive on different lines in para. 12. Bara. 15. I recommend that the information be obtained by tele gram from Bushire, and without reference to Messrs. Wonckhaus. When that is obtained I would suggest that before we do anything further the expert views of Hr. Strick be taken informally and confidentially as a preliminarymeasure, o ! ± one position s,s we now }i8,ve it. Ke would probably be able to make useful comment, and I could be used to get his views if (lovernment do not wish to communicate with him, (Signed) P. Z.

Sir, Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received January 10.) Board of Trade, January 9, 1914. I AM directed by tlie Board of Trade to refer to your letter of the olst October, and its enclosures, regarding Messrs. TVonckhaus and Co.’s claim to compensation in connection with the Abu Musa red oxide difficulty, and to offer the following observations thereon for Sir E. Grey’s consideration 1 The Board note that, while it is proposed to compensate Messrs. Wonckhaus in respect of their losses owing to the non-fulfilment of their contract of the 1st June, 1900, for the purchase of red oxide mined in Abu Musa, His Majesty’s Government refuse to recognise any claim on the part of the firm as shareholders in the company which held the concession for mining in that island, more especially as their share in that company was purchased at a date when they must have been aware that the concession had been cancelled. 2. As regards the claims now under consideration, the Board apprehend that these are as follows :— (a.) That the firm’s direct losses be refunded—the counts of the claim being set out under five sub-heads (see enclosure to Prince Lichnowsky’s note of the 5th April). (5.) That a lump sum be paid to the firm to compensate them for the profit which they might have been expected to make &gt; but did not make) had their contract with Hassan Samaiya been uninterrupted. It is understood that this proposal has been accepted by Messrs. Wonckhaus and the German Government, and that the sum paid is to be in final extinction of all rights which the firm may have acquired whether under the contract or otherwise. 3. As regards (a), the Board are disposed to think that Messrs. Wonckhaus’s claim under sub-head (1) might in principle be allowed in respect both of advances to the mining company and of implements lost on the island. It would, however, be incumbent on the firm to adduce satisfactory evidence as to the amount of such advances not repaid, and it would also be necessary for them to establish the precise nature and value of the implements destroyed or removed. 4. The Board understand, as a result of semi-official communication with your Department since the date of your letter under reply, that the shipment by the steam ship “ Louise ” (item 2), which consisted of 1,810 tons of oxide, was made in April 1908, in pursuance of the permission granted in Sir E. Grey’s note to the German Charge d’Affaires of the 10th January of that year. Thus three months were allowed to elapse between the date on which operations on Abu Musa ceased and the date on which permission to ship the oxide already on the beach was accorded, and about three months more elapsed before Messrs. Wonckhaus availed themselves of this privilege. The claim here is mainly one on account of deterioration of the oxide during this period of delay, but the Board note that, in Sir P. Cox’s opinion, no substantial deterioration can have occurred. If, however, the fact that deterioration did take place could be established, it would seem to have been due partly to the firm’s own inaction and partly to circumstances beyond their control. The extent to which these circumstances should be allowed for would largely depend upon the length of time the oxide in question had already been lying on the beach before the cessation of operations, and, for the purpose of any reference to arbitration, information on this point would have to be secured. 5. The Board concur in Sir E. Grey’s decision not to admit claims under item 5. Item No. 3, of course, disappears in view of the facts that the mines under present arrangements are not to be handed over to Messrs. Wonckhaus and that their claim as shareholders in the original mining concession is not to be recognised. The Board also note that Sir E. Grey is not prepared to make any allowance in respect of item 4. [2001 k—1]2 6 As regards the substantial part of Messrs. Wonckhaus’s claim comprised under’head (6), viz., that arising from the loss of anticipated profits under their contract with Hassan bamaiya, I am to state that 7 As the Board understand the matter, the quantity of red oxide to be shipped per annum under the contract was from 2,000 tons up to a maximum of o,000 tons, and the period of the contract four years, the firm having, however, the option ot renewal for a further period “at the same price and condition or at any rate at the price of other serious buyers.” The concession was terminated by f° r ce m October 1907 i.e. about one year and four months after the commencement of tfm contract on the 1st’June, 1906, and two years and eight months before the date on which it would in ordinary circumstances have elapsed if not renewed. It is assumed that the firm desire their claim to be considered as one to cover the whole period of then contract, subiect to a reduction on account of oxide actually shipped. . , r 8. It is understood that the quantities of oxide actually shipped by Messrs. Wonckhaus were as follows : in April 1908, by the steamship “ Louise, 1,810 tons ; in May 1911, 300 tons ; on the 14th November, 1912, 5,000 bags. The Board are not aware of the weight of a bag of oxide, but, having regard to the third paragraph of the contract of the 1st June, 1906, 5,000 bags would appear to amount to about 6 000 cwt. or 300 tons. In addition, it is understood that 400 tons were shipped by the steamship “Nasin,” in May 1910, on account of Hassan Samaiya, m fulfilment presumably of the third paragraph of Messrs. Wonckhaus’s contract with mm. _ 9 The Board also understand that at the time when operations on the isiand ceased there were lying on the beach the 1,810 tons shipped subsequently by the “Louise ” as well as 400 tons which that vessel did not remove, and that, m addition, 3 000 tons of oxide had been deposited near the mine. The Board are not, however, aware (1) whether anv shipment of oxide was made by Messrs. M onckhaiis under their contract before the “ Louise ” shipment; and (2) whether any of the oxide mined at the date when the concession was cancelled had been mined before the commence ment of the contract list June, 1906). If it should be possible to answer both these questions in the negative, and if the quantity above referred to (about 0,210 tons) represents the total output of the mine during the expired period of the contract (about one year and four months), it would appear that Messrs. Wonckhaus s claim m respect of that period can only relate to the difference between the 5,210 tons and the total amount shipped by them (2,410 tons—excluding the shipment of 400 tons on behalf of Hassan). In the contrary event, allowance would have to be made accordingly. As, however, Messrs. Wonckhaus were definitely granted permission on the 15th December, 1911, to remove all the oxide which had been mined and not already removed, provided they did so before the end of 1912, they cannot, so far as the Board are aware, properly blame anyone but themselves if they did not avail themselves of this privilege in its entirety. The Board are therefore of opinion that a claim to compensation should be admitted only in respect of the unexpired portion ol the contract (viz., two years and eight months). _ 10. On the other hand, the Board are disposed to think that some allowance (say for two years’ shipments) might be made to the firm in consideration of loss under the renewal clause of their contract. But it must be observed that the words at any rate at the price of other serious buyers ” appear to ^contemplate the possibility oi the contract, if renewed, being renewed on terms less advantageous to Messrs. Wonckhaus. . . , 1 . - , , M 11. I am, however, to point out in this connection that, whilst deposits ot red oenre are very widely distributed throughout the world, certain kinds derived from the islands 'of the Persian Gulf (principally Hormuz) are understood to have special qualities as regards shade. It is also understood that these varieties, for which there is much demand in the trade, cannot be replaced from other sources. The market for red oxide of this kind is, however, limited, and, with the Hormuz deposits working, it may be questioned whether the market could (without a considerable resultant depreciation in value) have absorbed more than the minimum (2,000 tons) of Abu Musa oxide allowed to be shipped by Messrs. Wonckhaus’s contract^ Nevertheless, it would seem that, if the 5,210 tons above referred to were actually mined during the expired period of the contract, the annual output during that period at least was considerably in excess of 2,000 tons. &gt; . . „ 4) 12. If, therefore, allowance be made for shipment at the minimum rate ol 2,oU tons per annum for the unexpired period of the contract plus 4,000 tons in considera tion of loss under the renewal clause, the total amount of oxide for which Messrs. Wonckhaus would receive compensation would be 9,333 tons, or roughly 10,000 tons. If, for Ite 1 heir loss c 16,01, t° head (a) 0 rW 13. ^ mi ight pro paragraph advance a immediate firm, do oxide on t would lav have been world’s su thecarria^ it would li as much a portion; i average s' 14.' referred t by compe boohs in As regan the Gen enclosure to a men Sir E.

Wonckhaus mig t properly be based on the general principles indicated in the foregoing paragraphs, they are not in a position to check Messrs. Wonckhans’s figures or to a vance any estimate other than the very rough calculation contained in the immediately preceding paragraph — of the amount of compensation to he paid to that nrm. n particular they have no information as to (1) the average market price of red oxide on the continent during the unexpired term of the contract, or what that price would have been had the contract been permitted to run— t.e., whether the prices would have been depressed by the addition of the produce of the Abu Musa mines to the world s supply, (2) what toe average cost of freight, insurance, and commission for the carriage of the oxide to Europe would have amounted to in the period ; (3) whether it would have been possible for the Abu Musa Companv to have mined more than, or as much as, the 2,0()() tons per annum stipulated in the contract during its unexpired portion , and (4) whether the quality of the oxide from the Abu Musa mines w r as up to average standard. 14. The foregoing points, together with the items 1 and 2 of head (a) above referred to, might, in the Board’s view, properly form the subject of an investigation by compeient arbitrators, to whom the evidence available from Messrs. AVonckhaus’s books in respect of the trial, shipment, and from other sources could be submitted. As regards the tribunal to which this enquiry should be entrusted, the Board note that the German Government in their Memorandum, copy of which formed one of the enclosures in your letter under reply, appear to contemplate the submission of the case to a mercantile expert in London, and they are accordingly disposed to suggest for Sir E. Grey’s consideration that, for the purposes of a commercial ascertainment of the facts, no better tribunal could be suggested than a court of arbitration appointed by the London Chamber of Commerce. 15. Information wdth regard to the two points referred to in the paragraph of this letter, numbered 9, may perhaps best be obtained from Messrs. AVonckhaus direct before any reference is made to arbitration. I am, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY. 4 I,1 ■MBS Sir, Put awe-'- vr*y No. Of 1913.

WITH reference to tbe previous correspondence regarding the claim of Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Co. to compensation in connection with the red oxide industry in the island of Abu Musa, of which copies have been communicated periodically to your Department, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Board of Trade, copies of further letters from the German Embassy and the India Office on the subject.^ It will be seen that Mr. Brown, the firm’s representative, has now supplied particulars which, it is considered, should be taken as a basis for estimating the compensation to be paid to Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. on account of the cancellation of their contract by the Sheikh of Sharga Sir E. Grey presumes that such com pensation might well amount to a sum less than that which the firm might have hoped to make if their contracts had been carried through in the most favourable conditions and without the slightest hitch, whereas Mr. Brown’s figures appear to be calculated on the latter assumption. He considers, therefore, that it will be necessary to refer the question of the amount of compensation actually due to some independent tribunal possessing the business experience necessary to fix it, I am accordingly to request that you will inform the Board of Trade that he would be grateful if they would cause the figures supplied by Messrs. Wonckhaus to be examined, and furnish him with their views as to the reasonableness of the claim. Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive at the same time any suggestions which the Board mav be good enough to offer as to the tribunal to which the fixation of the amount of compensation due should lie referred.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department telegram No. 316 S., dated 19th August, I have the honour to submit some further observations on Messrs. Wonckhaus’ objections and counter-proposals in connection with the settlement of the Abu Musa case. 2. I am generally familiar with the conditions existing on the island, but my present remarks are made after a special visit for the purpose and after discussion with the Residency Agent and Hassan Samaiyeh. The purport of the latter’s statement to the Residency Agent and myself is also attached. It^ will he seen that I have little more to say than has already been repre sented in my telegrams of 19th June, and I need only reiterate the view that the most satisfactory course will be to give Messrs. Wonckhaus a lump sum which will buy him out completely and leave him, if he wishes to go on trading in oxide, to buy in the market on the same footing as others. o o Messrs. Wonckhaus' observations. After our former experiences with Shaikh Seker, who claims the right of cancelling at any time, without indicating his reasons, concessions granted by him, we have no confi dence that a fresh concession from him would enable the mines to be worked steadily and on a technically sound basis. The parties concerned—the British Government, the Shaikh and our selves—are scarcely likely to be able to reach an agreement as to the persons to be considered “ suitable ”. We ourselves have the first claim to consideration in any concession. But who is to be the competent person to settle such differences arising in future ? And who is responsible for the damage incurred by (reason of) the person working the mines, for failure to carry out the contracts of delivery ? Resident's comment. If we and the Shaikh are in accord as to the individuals to whom the fresh concession is to be given, Messrs. Wonckhaus may be confident that the mines would be worked satisfactorily. I gather that we should merely con template eliminating Abdulla bin Hassan from the syndicate on personal grounds and substituting a suitable British or British Indian merchant or firm on whom we could rely to work the concern properly. The assurance through the German Government con templated by the Foreign Office should fully meet the case. The parties concerned are the British Government and the Shaikh. All Messrs. Wonckhaus are properly con cerned about is to get the oxide that they want, f.o.b., on reasonably favour able terms. They are also, no doubt, anxious to see that the interests of their friend, Hassan Samaiyeh, do not go to the wall; but if the latter is admitted into the new concession they will have no cause for anxiety on this score. This is begging the question. We consider that Messrs. Wonckhaus have no claim except to be in a position to buy oxide. The Shaikh of Shargah under our advice. The concessionaires who would be British subjects and personally amen able to British jurisdiction.:zz 2 (2) As regards the further pro posal that we should he reinstated in our contract rights for a period equal to that during which the contract was interrupted, i.e., for about two years and eight months, it must he observed that such a proposal does not take sufficient account of the present state of the oxide industry. The preparations extending over several years for carrying on this industry must be regarded as entirely lost and the work will for the most part have to he undertaken entirely anew. Two or three years will elapse before we reach approximately the point at which we were at the time of our forcible ejection from the island of Abu Musa. The further period allowed us would expire before we could bring large shipments on to the market. It should further he borne in mind that if we accept the present com promise we should not be in a posi tion to guarantee the regular delivery of the oxide to our customers. I submit that His Majesty’s Foreign Office are mistaken in thinking that there is any justice in this second objec tion. The paragraph is entirely misleading and inaccurate. Messrs. Wonckhaus’ contract with the concessionaires was on an f. o. b. basis and they had nothing whatever to do with any “ preparations extend ing over several years”. The work had been going on and mined oxide slowly accumulated for seven years before Messrs. Wonckhaus came on the scene, and it is to be noted that no oxide has ever been mined for Wonckhaus. W^hat he has shipped has been what was already mined before his contract. Hassan Samaiyeh says he would be able to start mining oxide for ship ment in two months, and we could, if necessary, do it considerably quicker. There is no question of the work having to be undertaken entirely anew, unless it be desired to break fresh ground and start a new mine alto gether. As regards the existing mine: at the time the last digging went on some non-oxide debris broke away from above the spot where the men were digging, and after personal inspection of the mine with expert companions, I can say that 50 coolies for one week at the outside would be required to clear the debris and put the mine in the state it was in before. There is nothing to prevent the new concessionaires from undertaking to supply so many tons per annum sup posing that geological examination indicates that the stuff is there. Hitherto the mine has been worked on a very small scale, and has never turned out or needed to turn out anything like 5,000 tons per annum. In the present cutting there is only room for about 70 men to work, and if a greater output were required the cutting would have to be enlarged in order to accommodate more workers. This appears to be altogether too fanciful to require comment. Hassan Samaiyeh states that he took Es. 2,000 (£ 133) as an advance from We, therefore, beg leave to submit the following counter-proposal:— Shaikh Seker to grant us, &amp;c. The direct losses which we have sustained through the interruption of the work on Abu Musa are as fol lows • (1) Our advances to the mining company, and value of the deposits3 on the island which have either been destroyed or remoyed—13,106 marks (£ 655). (2) The damage sustained through the “ Louise * * It is well known that the quality of the “Louise” shipment suffered from the oxide having been left lying unprotected for a period of fully six months after the interruption of work, close to the shore to which it was taken for shipment. (3) A lump sum to cover the cost of putting the mines again into a state of repair. We estimate that a sum of 30,000 marks will be necessary for this. (4) A suitable compensation for the employes of the firm (two Europeans and ten natives) for the serious danger to which they were exposed by the firing on Abu Musa. (5) Suitable compensation should also be paid in respect of the general damage sustained by our firm through the interruption of mining opera tions. Messrs. Wonckhaus in the first instance, and the sum went into his general oxide account with Wonckhaus. He says the account is not actually closed, but it is practically squared and there is nothing to speak of on one side or the other. Possibly he may be very slightly on the wrong side. Wonckhaus’ contract being f. o. b., he can have no claim for any oxide on the island. The answer to this claim is clearly that indicated in Foreign Office letter of 21st May to India Office. But even supposing that they were entitled to make any claim, the grounds on which they now base it will not bear the least scrutiny. Both at Hormuz and at Abu Musa it has been the custom for the respective conces sionaires always to keep a few coolies at the mining work, amassing stuff for subsequent export, when orders are received. The mineral often lies for months and even a year awaiting ship ment, but the fact is that the action of dew and ordinary atmospheric moisture is to form the surface of the oxide heap into a hard crust which preserves the contents from sun and weather. It is quite safe as long as it is left like this. It is in the actual handling on the sea shore, in shipping, that in windy weather you get an admixture of sand, just as you do in coal. Such a thing as covering the mineral with planks or protecting it in any way is unknown. To put the mine in the same state as it was before and at the time that Wonckhaus made his contract, will consist merely of clearing a little debris wffiich has crumbled away and fallen from above. We can do it for 500 rupees. Messrs. Wonckhaus’ claim is lidiculous. Moreover, the mine does ( not concern him, but the oxide f. o. b. | It would appear that “Haji Ali Germani,” Brown’s companion on the occasion in question, is classed as a European. Claim can only be regarded as entirely inadmissible for the reasons stated in Foreign Office letter dated 21st May. If Messrs. Wonckhaus have any \ justifiable claim at all, it must, I think, I be regarded as falling under this head.Statement made by Hassan Samaiyeh in answer to Residents enquiries made in the presence of the Residency Agent at Lingah and Khan Sahib Haji Abdur Rezak of the Bushire Residency. Lingah, 27th August 1913. Hassan Samaiyeh states under examination : I took an advance of Rs. 2,000 from Messrs. Wonckhaus m the first ins tance. The item was debited against me in my general running account with them. I do not remember informing my partners at Shargah of having taken this advance. I have shipped oxide for Messrs. Wonckhaus 3 or 4 times. Our account is not finally balanced up, hut there is little or nothing outstanding on either side, there may possibly be something very inconsiderable due from me. X began excavating oxide the same year X got the concession and used to keep about 50 coolies working from time to time. I have shipped alto gether, I suppose, about 20,000 tons. I have not yet rendered any account of this to Esa bin Abdul Latif. My custom was to have a small gang of coolies permanently working and collecting oxide so as to have it ready for shipment on receipt of an order. It has never been my custom to put anything over the oxide as a protec tion, for this reason that the first night’s dew is sufficient to form a hard crust over it which preserves the contents from all weather. I have kept it a year or more lying there without deterioration. My contract with Wonckhaus was merely to deliver oxide f. o. b. He had no concern with my preparations. I should be prepared to start regular excavation of oxide for shipment, as hitherto, in two months from time of warning. Hitherto I have never employed more than 60 or 70 men and the digging space is limited. If it were desired to employ more men the width of the excavated space must be increased. Before me.

Foreign Office With reference to the letter from this Office of the Zty * instant relative to the question of red oxide on the island of Abu Musa, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith translation of a communication from the German Embassy, enclosing particulars, supplied by Mr. Brown, which, it is suggested, should be taken as a basis for estimating the compensation to be paid to the firm of Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus end Company on account of the cancellation of their contract. While it is, in Sir E. Grey's opinion, desirable that the Board of Trade should be asked to check, so far as possible, the accuracy of the figures quoted in this paper, he thinks it inadvisable for His Majesty's Government to endeavour to settle on this basis, direct with the German Government, the amount of The Under Secretary of State, . India Office.(43137/13)• of compensation to te paid to the firm. The proposal at present under discussion is that a sum should he paid to the firm as compensation for the loss suffered by them through the interruption of their business in consequence of the cancellation of their contract by the Sheikh of Sharga and Sir E. Grey presumes that such compensation would amount to a sum less than the firm might have hoped to make if their contracts had been carried through in the most favourable conditions and without the slightest hitch. It is however on this assumption that the firm, in the present communication, would appear to base their claim and it is therefore, as it seems to Sir E. Grey, necessary eventually to refer the question of the amount of compensation actually due to some independent tribunal possessing the business experience necessary to fix it. I am accordingly to state that, subject to any observations which the Marquess of Orewe may wish to offer(43137/13). olfer, Sir E. Grey is disposed to submit the figures supplied by the firm to the examination of the Board of Trade and to ask them at the same time for their advice as to the tribunal to v/hich the fixation of the amount of compensation due should be referred.

A ton, therefore, cost the firm 31s. 9d. landed at Hamburg. The firm calculated the average sale price as G5s., the average net profit thus working out at 33s. 3d. per ton. The price of 15s. 6d. is fixed by the agreement of the firm of Wonckhaus with the mining company, and a copy of 'this agreement is presumably in the possession of the Foreign Office. The firm can produce vouchers showing the freight rates actually paid. Insurance and discharging are not supported by special vouchers, but the charges are in conformity with the usual rates. As to the prices actually realised for the oxide shipped on the steamship “ Stolzenfels,” particulars are given in the annexed extract from the books of the firm.* As may be seen from these figures, the calculation of an average sale price of 65s. is a low estimate, for the prices realised relate to a trial shipment of 700 tons; if the continuance of the operations had allowed contracts extending over a long period to be entered into, the firm would, they declare, have realised still better prices than in the case of the first shipment. The Imperial Embassy would be glad to be informed up till what date the representative of the firm of Wonckhaus is to submit his documentary evidence to a mercantile expert here in London, and what further points, outside the submission of this evidence, still require to be explained and proved by the firm. ’ German Embassy, London, September 18, 1913. * Not printed.

Foreign Office September 24111, 1913. %J %j / ; Sir:- \ c With reference to your letter of July 8th(P.2567) ) relative to the question of red oxide at Abu Musa, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that the German Charge d*Affaires recently telephoned privately to this Office to say that Mr. Brown., a re presentative of Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Company, was in London and to suggest that advantage might be taken of this gentleman's presence to discuss the mat ter informally in the hope of arriving at a speedier settlement than could be reached by further official correspondence. 1. This suggestion having been accepted, Herr von Kuhlmann and Mr. Brown called forthwith and were re- °Py to India 26 SEP 1913 ceived by Mr. Norman and Mr. Malkin. S. The various items of Messrs. Wonckhaus' claim for ompensation on account of losses suffered through the interruption of their business were first summarily examined The Under Secretary of State, India Office.his telegram of June 28th (copy of which was enclosed in your letoer of June 30th) to certain of them were pointed out. 4--It will he within the Marquess of Crewe's recol lection that this claim was formulated hy the firm in accordance with point 1 of the proposal of His Majes ty's Government for a compromise put forward in Sir E. Grey's note to the German Ambassador of December 6th 1911. ^ In the course of this examination it was ascer- tained that the text of the memorandum hy Messrs. Wonckhaus enclosed in the note of Prince Lichnowsky , | of April 5th (copy of which was enclosed in the letter from this Office of May 21st) contained an error which had led to some misunderstanding:- b.The 15th paragraph of the memorandum runs, in the English translation as follows:- '(l) Our advances to the lining Company and the value of the deposits on the island, &amp;c( 42511 / 13 ) 7- ^ this passage the word objects should he sub stituted for the word deposits and the reference is to the implements respecting the disappearance of which complaint has already been made by the firm. The error arose through the substitution in the original German text communicated to this Office by Prince Lichnowsky of the word Orundschichten for the word Oegenstande . Herr von Kuhlmann eventually observed that so long as the main question at issue (dealt with under red to) was satisfactorily settled, the claim for and might well be largely reduced and met by the pay ment of a lump sum without further enquiry as to the justice of its various component items. lo, As regards the main question, to which the dis cussion then passed, Mr. Brown at first contended that Messrs. Wonckhaus could not carry on the business satisfactorily unless they themselves were the actual point 2 of the proposal for a compromise above refer compensation under point 1 was relatively unimportant concessionnaires(42511/13) concessiomoires, as they could not trust the natives of those regions to choose for shipment oxide of the quality required, to clear the mineral before shipment 01 to guarantee punctual delivery. He admitted how- ever that Nassau Samaiya was satisfactory from this point of view, an admission which shows, it may he ob served incidentally, that this individual is entirely controlled by the German firm. //.Herr von Ktihlmanr and Mr. Brown were informed that there were, in the view of His Majesty*s Govern ment, serious objections to the grant of the concession to Messrs. Wdnckhaus and Mr. Brown thereupon somewhat abruptly declared that in that case the firm would be glad to dissociate themselves from the whole business for a reasonable consideration. 12. Mr. Brown then put forward orally the proposal em bodied in the enclosed memorandum and was told that it would be discussed with your Department before another meeting, at which a representative of that Department would be asked to be present, took place. U I' , ir( 42511 / 13 ) -ifrs proposal was accordingly discussed unofficially r. Shuckdurgh and it was decided that the sug gested grant of a concession to Messrs. Wonckhaus and its sale hy them would introduce an unnecessary com plication into the negotiations and that it would ac cordingly oe preferable to pay to the firm a lump sum on the basis of point2of the British proposal for a compromise, which the firm should accept in full dis charge of their claim under that head, and in final extinction of any rights v/hich they may have acquired in respect of Abu TT usa oxide either under their con tract with Hassan Samaiya or by any other transaction whatsoever. /A It was thought that a considerable part at least of the sum required might be derived from the proceeds of the sale of a new concession to a British firm. IS', At a second meeting held at this Office on the 12th instant at which, in addition to the four persons who attended the first, Mr. Shuckburgh was present, this proposal was submitted to the Germans and at once accepted(42511/13) accepted by them. /d They were then informed that the figures presented hy Messrs. Wonckhaus in connexion with their claim would probably have to be submitted to some impartial tribunal, to which Mr. Brown raised no objection. 7. Mr. Brown undertook to furnish the necessary de tails within a week or two and I am to state that,when these are received. Sir E. drey would propose, subject to Lord Crewe's concurrence, to submit them in the first instance to the Board of Trade. /?. The question of the tribunal to which the deci sion of the amount to be paid is to be referred, should that course prove necessary, would appear to be one which can conveniently be considered later. I am. Your most obedient.Statement made by Mr. Brown. We propose to settle the case as follows:- (1) That our direct losses be refunded to us. These have been stated in our last Memorandum. Where v'e have not mentioned the sum, we suggest to appoint Arbitrators, both parties agreeing to abide by their decision. ( 2 ) That the Phe j kh will grant us a new concession for a period of 6 years on the terms of the original on^.

When the Sheikh withdrew the concession, he gave as the principal reason that we were getting the Oxide too cheap.

Slr:- /• With reference to your letter of the 21st. ultimo and previous correspondence relative to the question of red oxide on Abu Musa Island, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith a translation of a note from the German Ambassador at this Court forwarding a translation of a letter from Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company stating their objections to the proposals for a compromise contained in the note addressed to Count Metternlch on December 6th, 1911. 1. Prince Lichnowsky alpo enquires when the direct negotiations between His Majesty*s Government and the firm, the suggestion for which was made on January 9th. by the Councillor of the Embassy in a conversation with Sir L. Mallet and accepted by the latter on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in his note of January 17th. should begin. vGriV As The Under Secretary of State, India Office. 22 i,lAVI 313 } 23 MAY 1913 • Pjcr ,v £3 nc 211 (17815/15) ^ An regards Messrs. Wonckhaus* first objection, I am to state that Sir E. Grey is disposed to admit that the considerations advanced are not without force and th&amp;t, while he would he unwilling, for political reasons, to see a concession for the working of the mines granted, to the firm themselves, he would consent to give to them, through the German Government, an assurance that, in the event of the grant of such a concession to a person or persons agreeable to His Majesty's Government, the latter will use their in fluence with the Sheikh of Sharga to ensure that he shall abstain from vexatious interference with the rights and operations of the concessionnaires. / Sir E. Grey is further disposed to recognise a certain justice in the second objection in view of the fact that some time must necessarily elapse before the mines can again be profitably worked, and he would accordingly be willing to consent to some extension of the two years and eight months originally suggested. £ While admitting to the above extent the validity of the considerations advanced by Messrs. Wonckhaus, SirB.d 15.6 (17815/13) Sir E. Grey muBt neverthelesB regard th eir counter- propoBal eb wholly Inacceptahle. b-If nothing had occurred to interrupt the regular fulfilment of their contract, the firm would have had. the right to huy a maximum of Five thousand tons of oxide a year for four years at Fifteen shillings and sixpence a ton, whereas they now demand for themselves in consideration of a nominal rent the entire profit on all the mines on the island for six years with the practical certainty of receiving it for six more. It is clear that, were this demand entertained they would find themselves in a position infinitely more advan tageous than that which they would have occupied under the original arrangement, and one to which the Sheikh of Sharga would without doubt strongly object. j. Sir E. Grey regards as equally Inadmissible the claims for damages put forward in the statement which follows in Messrs. Wdnckhaus' letter. The item numbered (l) deals in reality with two separate claims. The first of these on account of advances to the mining company, could be made the subject of enquiries on the spot though it is hard to believe(17815/13) believe that the Bums advanced can have been very con- siderable. As for the second, the destruction of deposits referred to is presumably destruction by exposure to the weather, but Sir E. Grey does not know by whom any oxide has been removed except by Messrs. Wonckhaus themselves. Further information would there fore have to be supplied by the firm with reference to this item. y. Item 2 of the claim appears to Sir E. Grey to be entirely unjustified. The oxide shipped by the 'Louise' was allowed to leave by His Majesty's Govern ment as an act of grace in order to render easier the position of Messrs. Wonckhaus. Any profit whatever made from this shipment must therefore be regarded as pure gain for the firm and His Majesty's Government cannot admit any claim based on the fact - if it be a fact - that the quality of the mineral is inferior to that of previous consignments or that there has been a difficulty of disposing of it. 10. It appears to Sir E. Grey that if the claim under (3) is valid at all it concerns a question which should be settled between the Sheikh and the mining company.(17815/13) and that the claim that MesBrs. Wonckhaus and Company should not only receive the concession for v/orking the mines hut also he paid the amount necessary to put the mines in order is a preposterous one. li Items (4) and ( 5 ) appear entirely inadmissible. As regards the former, the employes of the firm were not injured and, when fired on, were in a place where they had no business to he. They have therefore no right to complain of any fright or inconvenience which they may have suffered in consequence of an act done at their own risk. The latter claim appears to Sir E. Grey to he completely unsubstantial and to belong to a category which His Majesty^ Government have been un willing to consider in the past. 12. Sir E. Grey is disposed to think, in view of the last sentence of Messrs. Wonckhaus' letter, that the best solution of the whole question would be the pay ment of a lump sum to the firm which should take no account of separate and detailed claims. iy Before however making any proposal of this nature to the German Government, Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn(17815/13) learn the views of the Marquees of Crewe on the subject. /^I an accordingly to propose that Prince Lichnowsky* note Bhould he referred to the consideration of His Majesty's Consul General at Bush ire through, the Govern ment of India and that, in the meanwhile. His Excellency • V ( should he informed that while Messrs. Wonckhaus* communication will he carefully examined.

It is precisely the existence of these conditions in the oxide industry which cause us to adopt the prolongation clause in our contract with the mining company, rom the above it will be seen what difficulties we should encounter were we to accep the British proposals. We therefore beg leave to submit the following counter proposal:— ^ &amp; Sheikh Seker to grant us, under the guarantee of the British and German oyernments, a concession for all the oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa for a peno ot six years, and on the conditions laid down in the original concession of the mining company.

Should there be any other applicant, we are to be entitled to tender with him. ; i e &gt; , British Government have expressed the wish to be furnished with a complete an detailed statement of our claims for damages. The direct losses which we have sus amed through the interruption of the work on Abu Musa are as follows :— . , ^ UI&gt; ac ^ vanc es to the mining company, and the value of the deposits on the is and which have been either destroyed or removed, 13,106 M. [ 618 ] I !&lt;? i u&gt;2 *1 r (2.) The damage sustained through the “Louise.” r lhe value of this shipment can be proved, by comparison with the “ Stolzenfels” shipment, to have been, at the lowest estimate, 20 M. per 1,000 kilog. Of this we still have about 469 tons lying unused; we only very rarely succeed in selling small quantities of this, since the oxide has been rendered useless for nearly all industries by the presence of salt deposit and fine sand. In addition we should be compensated for storage expenses, the interest thereon, and insurance expenses. It is well known that- the quality of the “ Louise shipment suffered from the oxide having been left lying unprotected for a period of fully six months after the interruption of work, close to the shore to which it was being taken for shipment. Sandstorms and spray and exposure' to the weather must greatly affect the quality of oxide, because, firstly, the colour- became darker ; and, secondly, the colouring properties of the oxide had considerably diminished owing to the action of salt, sand, and weather. The damage under this head can be proved to amount to 78,506 M. 31 pf. We endeavoured at the time to induce the sheikh to allow at least a few of our people to remain on the island in order to protect the oxide from deterioration by covering over with planks the quantity which had been carried to the shore for shipment; our request was, however, not granted. (3.) A lump sum to cover the cost of putting the mines again into a state of repair. We estimate that a sum of 30,000 M. will be necessary for this. We cannot furnish documentary evidence in regard to this amount. On our making enquiries ol our local representative in regard to the amount necessary for the repair of the mines, the above sum was indicated to us as being absolutely necessary. (4.)

' Eespecting Abu Musa. t . t v , / ^ ^ Hamburg, March 10, 1013. vVlt beg leave to point out the following objections to the compromise suggested by the British Government for the settlement of the Abu Musa case:— 1. After our former experiences with Sheikh Seker, who claims the right of cancelling, at any time and without indicating his reasons, concessions granted by him, we have no confidence that a fresh concession from him would enable the mines to be w r orked^ steadily and on a technically sound basis. As regards the transfer of the concession to ‘ c suitable persons,” the parties concerned—the British Government, the sheikh, and ourselves—are scarcely likely to be able to reach an agreement as to the persons to be considered as “ suitable.” On the other hand, the fact should be taken into account that, in view of the circumstances of the case, we ourselves have the first claim to consideration in any concession which is granted, since it is we who would have the greatest interest in the mines being worked in a rational way, and since we are in every way competent to carry on the work. Moreover, the position created by the granting of the concession to a third person would be uncertain from this point of view also : that there wmuld always be the possibility, if not the probability, of conflicts in the future. But who is to be the competent person to settle such differences of view arising in the future, and who is responsible for the damage incurred by the person working the mines for failure to carry out the coutracts of delivery ? 2. As regards the further proposal that we should be reinstated in our contract rights for a period equal to that during which the contract was interrupted, i.e., for about two years and eight months, it must be observed that such a proposal does not take sufficient account of the present situation of the oxide industry. The preparations extending over several years for carrying on this industry must be regarded as entirely lost, and the work will, for the most part, have to be undertaken anew. Two to three •years will elapse before we reach approximately the point at which we were at the time of our forcible ejection from the island of Abu Musa. The further period to be allowed to us would therefore have expired before we could bring large shipments on to the market. It should further be borne in mind that, if we accept the present compromise, we should not be in a position to guarantee the regular delivery of the oxide to our customers. Every purchaser of oxide would insert in any fresh contract a condition that we should guarantee the regular delivery of the oxide over a considerable period of years. It is precisely the existence of these conditions in the oxide industry which caused us to adopt the prolongation clause in our contract with the mining company. From the above it will be seen what difficulties we should encounter were we t accept the British proposals. We therefore beg leave to submit the following counter proposal:— Sheikh Seker to grant us, under the guarantee of the British and German Governments, a concession for all the oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa for a period of six years, and on the conditions laid down in the original concession of the mining company. We ourselves to work the mines and to make use of them as we think fit. During this period the concession can on no account be withdrawn. Sheikh Seker shall further be obliged, after the expiration of the first six years of the concession, to renew it for a further period of six years on the same conditions, if no other applicant is forthcoming. Should there be any other applicant, we are to be entitled to tender with him. The British Government have expressed the wish to be furnished with a complete and detailed statement of our claims for damages. The direct losses which we have sustained through the interruption of the work on Abu Musa are as follows :— (I.) Our advances to the mining company, and the value of the deposits on the ^ u island which have been either destroyed or removed, 13,106 M. &gt; [ 618 ] y \(2.)

Section 1. [ 2531 ] No. 1. Sit Tj. Mallet to Couiicillov of German Embassy. SIR LOUIS MALLET presents his compliments to the Councillor of the German Embassy and, with reference to the conversation which took place on the 9th instant relative to the question of the red oxide mines in the island of Abu Musa, has the honour to state that, if Herr Y onckhaus will be good enough to adopt the proposal that he should visit this country m order to set forth his objections to certain of the suggestions for a settlement in the last British note, representatives of His Majesty’s Government will be very happy to receive him. J Sir L. Mallet ventures at the same time to suggest that it might assist discussion and facilitate an early settlement if His Majesty’s Government were furnished, previous to Herr Wonckhauss arrival, with spine written indication of the nature of the objections which he desires to raise to the British proposals. Foreign Office, January 17, 1913.foreign office February 5+.h, 1913 I Wlth referenc e to your letter of January 30+h about Abu Mu pa oxide, we told the German Babaesy on January 17th. that we welcomed the idea of Wonckhaue coming over here to negotiate and Fince then have not heard from them on the pubject fo we do not know the date of hip arrival. WonckhauB* proposal to come here seemB to show that he ip in good dispositions and anxious to settle the question in a friendly spirit end in the circumstances it appears to us undesirable to risk spoiling the prospects of an amicable settlement ofworrying hira over the oxide remaining in the island after the expiration of the time limit s . It seemp to ub to he preferable to hold our power to refuse an extension of the time allowed as a weapon m reserve to he used if Wonckhaus proves recalcitrant in the course of the negotiationp.

No further shipment was made up to 31st December, and from agent’s report dated 17th January, it appears that Hasan’s gear has now been removed from the island.

The quantity placed in bags up to now comes up to 9000 (nine thousand) bags; and the &amp;&amp; rest remains loose and they, the labourers, are awaiting more empty bags which Hassan bin Someiyah has promised to send at an early date. According to the information given to me by Hassan bin Someiyah, he has arranged to shir fiar© thousand bags oxide to Bombay by the sailing vessel 'Shah Jahun' and proposes that the vessel should call at the island in the beginning of November to ship the five thousand bags. Ho i &lt;3 also negotiating to arrange for a steamer of the Bombay and Persia Company to ship the remainder of the oxide.Copy) T E L I S RA M. - P.
