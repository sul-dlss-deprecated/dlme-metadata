We asked a British official of Misr Airwork here if there was anything in the rumour that the company were negotiating for a service between Bagdad and Kov/eit and he replied that he thought that this rumour might have arisen from a recent Misr scheme for a service between Bagdad and Basra. This had, however, subsequently been dropped and there were at present no negotiations in progress, or in prospect,for any such service. We are sending a copy of this letter to Foreign Office.

Section 3. [E 7924/27/93] No. 1. Sir F. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 27.) (No. 772.) Sir, Bagdad, December 9, 1933. 0 ^ WITH reference to my despatch No. 240 of the 12th April last, regarding the opening of the new air port at BagdaHTTTiave the honour to report that the Iraqi Government continue to extend the facilities afforded in this country to civil aviation. 2. The additional night flying equipment at the Bagdad air port, mentioned in paragraph 5 of that despatch, is now in course of erection. At this time of the year the Imperial Airways mail aeroplane from India lands there weekly after dark. 3. During the summer, a Marconi Adcock wireless direction-finder was installed at Rutbah Wells, and the aerodrome there will shortly be provided with a flood light. The new direction-finder is an up-to-date apparatus. It overcomes the night error to which other forms of direction-finder are susceptible. I under stand that, although its installation has cost the Iraqi Government about £1,500, no charge will be made to those who make use of it. It will be of considerable assistance to Messrs. Imperial Airways if, as proposed, they institute a night flying service across the desert next spring. 4. I have sent a copy of this despatch to Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. F. H.

U IPth pril, 19B5 Sip I have the honour to inform you that the nee * Iraqi Government Air-port at Bagdad eas officinlly opened by Hla Majeety King Paiaal on the 6th April. The Minister of Iconomlce and Communications invited to the ceremony about four hundred guests, including all members of the Corps Diplomatique. According to the programme, Hie Majesty wae to have arrived In his ovn Puss Moth aeroplane, accompanied by an eecort of six machines of the Royal ’Iraqi ir Force. Unfortunately a dust-cntom made flying impossible and he w as unable to do so. After a ape oh by His ’ xeellency Rustem Beg Haidar, giving s short history of the development of aviation in *Iraq, His Majesty ooened the main door of the air-port offices with a golden key *&gt;nd made a thorough insoeetion of the building. 2. The new air-port is conveniently situated on the western edge of the City, near the BngdadrBasrah Railway station, and in the angle formed by the main roads to Damascus and Mosul. It is about five minutes journey by oar from the hotels and the business centre. The aerodrome ie of ample dimensions, roughly a mile square, and may be approached from the air without feirr of obstruction of any kind. It is flat and stoneless, and thlly protected by dykes from flood. It Is not likely to be rendered unfit for use by wet weather, except in the unusual event of very heavy and continuous rain. In this respect it is considered better than the *B gdad Pest v aerodrome which it replaces. *. ght Honourable :ir John -.imon, G.C.2.1., K.G.V.O. , etc., etc., etc.i 1933 5. The aiivport offloeg arm housed in a spaoIoub building at the entrance to the aerr&gt;drone 9 designed by the Go Ye raaent Arohitect (Vr. son) in collaboration with t iu Pirector of Civil Aviation (Mr. J). W.Ounbley). tlie booking offices of the aviation comnnnles operating in ‘Iraq are grouped round n Inrge central reception hall. In one wing of the ground-floor there is a restaurant, and hotel accommodation for use of passengers as well as the crews of aeroplanes. The other wing of the ground-floor contains Government offices for the passport, customs, and health services. Postal and telegraphic facilities are also provided. The offices of the air-port management are on the first floor, and Include a wireless station, an t a lighting control for night traffic. There la an up to date wind recording apparatus. 4. The iosts ond Telegraphs have centralised their wireless receiving apparatus in the air-port, leaving the transmitters in their main offices In the City. By separating the transmitting from the receiving plant in this manner, they are able to wort in both directions at the same time and staff is economised. The receivers In the air-port are controlled from the main telegraph office for purposes of ordinary commercial traffic, and from the air-port for purposes of traffic with aircraft. The ^ ireless installation is all of United Kingdom manufacture, being supplied for the most part by Messrs.!! reoni, limited, and Is of the latest design. It Includes a wireless direction finder for the use of aircraft. 5. The aerodrome is well adapted for night flying; and the Neon location beacon light on the roof of the aiivport offices will be visible on a clear night from a distance of about sixty miles. A *’8had w-Bar w landing flood light, ^nd illuminated landing and boundary lights, are to he Installed within the next six months. 6.COPY (S 46B7/4/93) 78^6^/30.

My dear Air Commodore, ye are sending yon under separate cover (No.C.0.44^ dated tne 11th oX Jane,1^60), a copy oi correspondence wnich shows tnat His Majesty’s Government have now agreed to the establishment ol a regular Netnerlands commercial air service to India. The establisnment ox this service is lively to raise the question ox the Basrah aerodrome in the near iuture. The position is, as you are no doubt aware, tnat wnereas His Majesty's Government have represented to the Iraq Government the need ior a civil aerodrome at Basrah (vide our memorandum No.G.0.615 dated the 7tn oi August,IGEiO the Iraq Government have post poned consideration ox the question until they accede to the international Air Convention. Actually the construction ox an all weather aerodrome in the immediate neighbourhood of Basrah is going to cost a lot ox money (I believe the estimate is well over a lakh) which the Iraq Government cannot aixord at present. Tney Know however that the Air Ministry are obliged by their agreement with imperial Airways to provide the latter with an aerodrome near ^asrah and that when other foreign companies come along and usk/ Air Commodore 0.5.Burnett, C.B.,C.B.3.,D.3.0.as.£ for the sane facilities, the Air Ministry will have to do something about it. This is precisely what happened in the case oi Baghdad Jest aerodrome, but in the case of 3-haibah the position will be much more complicated, as the Air Ministry are not prepared to release Shaibah aerodrome lor civil aviation. What ihen is to happen when tne K.L.M. asi the Iraq government for the same lacilities for landing as are enjoyed by Imperial Airways? H the K.L.M. can be staved off, witnout violence to Article aI of the Anglo-lraq Treaty, by the argument that Iraq has not yet adnered to the international Air convention, tnis will only be a temporary expedient as Iraq proposes to accede to the Convention when parliament meets in November; and what is more tnis is a step which we have been, at the instance oi tne Air Ministry, urging them to taxe? I talxed this over at some length with Oliver last year and no doubt you or the Air Ministry have considered the problem, and possibly discovered a solution. I thought it advisable however to draw attention to it in case of accidents. Yours sincerely, ( 3 d.) x.3.i.Sturges.COi J Y ( E 4667/4/y^3 ) . FOxiEiill OFFICE, S.W.l. sept ember, 1^60 . Dear Hall, I an sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter Ko.76366/60 oi August £7th to ionteagle about the hasra aerodrome. 7e agree that tne legal position has not changed since 1626, and that, in the circumstances, there is no objection to your referring the Acting High Commissioner to Mr.Amery's Confidential despatch of December 14th, 1626, on the subject of the grant of special privileges to Imperial Airways in Royal Air Force service aerodromes. 7e are anxious to make it clear, however, that our concurrence on this point of xaot does not affect our views on the policy which should oe pursued as regards foreign flying in Iraq in general and in hasra in particular, un this point our official view is tnat it is imperative, on grounds of imperial policy, that some means or other should be found to grant full facilities to foreign aircraft to use an aerodrome at pasra. I understand that we have just authorised the Dutch, on a basis of reciprocal concession, to initiate a regular air service via Iraq and India to hatavia, and that we are negotiating with them to eztend this service to Australia. We are about to negotiate a similar arrangement with the French. A refusal to grant either J.H.Hall, 2sq., D. 3.0 ., !.C to/to Dutoh or French aircraft landing facilities at Basra would stultify boti agreenents, would certainly be interpreted as an act 01 bad faith on our part, and would involve as in all Kinds of difficulties. .Ve may aoreover still find it useful to obtain Dutcn cooperation in any representations we may have to maKe at Tehran about the extension of the time limit for our south Bersian service, and to antagonize then now over the use of an aerodrome at Basra would maXe such eventual cooperation impossible, and merely react to our own ultimate disadvantage. I do not want to raise this question on the present minor issue of tae information to be furnished to Bagdad in regard to the strictly legal position; but i have been asxed to make it clear tnat we must reserve our right to raise the whole question of policy separately at some future but probably not distant date. I am sending a copy of tnis letter to Courtney. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)
