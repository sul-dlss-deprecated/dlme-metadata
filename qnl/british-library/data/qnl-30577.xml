Officers when leaving Muscat. No. 24, dated Bushire, the 31st March 1894 (Confidential). From—C olonel F. A. Wilson, Officiating Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward copies of letters from the Political Agent, No. 39 , dated 16 th February 1894. Muscat, with copies of tlieir enclosures as » 44 &gt;» 28th *&gt; » marginally noted, on the subject of the discontinuance by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat of certain salutes to the representatives of Government which have always been customary, and of His Highness’s attitude in the matter. 2. Little comment on my part seems called for upon Major Sadler’s refer ences which very fully detail the facts, and the considerations bearing on the subject. The course adopted by the Sultan in this matter appears to me an exceedingly unfortunate one, and it is, I think, very much to be regretted that His Highness should have thought fit, without even condescending to give any explanation of the reasons for his action, as evidenced in his first letter, to sum marily curtail the mark of respect which, according to very long-established custom, has been shewn to the representatives of Government at Muscat and in the Persian Gulf. In his second letter the Sultan supports his action by the argument that it has not Ijeen the practice to fire salutes on departure, but in face of the facts cited by Major Sadler, this assertion, which His High ness would seem to have hesitated to make in the first instance, is so palpably opposed to the actual position, that it is difficult to understand how His High ness could have brought himself to put it forward. 3. There can be no doubt that salutes to the officers of Government have a distinct value and significance on these coasts, and I -cannot but think that the discontinuance of such a public mark of consideration, which has had the sanction of long-continued usage, would, in attracting very general notice, have an adverse influence upon the position and prestige of British Represent atives not only at Muscat, but at other places also where Government has political relations in these seas. No. 39, dated Muscat, the 16th February J.S94 (Confidential). From— Major J. Hayes Sadler, Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward copies with translated purport of the corre spondence which has passed between the Sultan and myself regarding the omission of the usual salute on the occasion of my departure in' December last to take charge of the office of Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf. 2. Although this correspondence refers solely to the question of salutes to * the Political Agent, I have some reason to believe that it is intended to apply as w r ell to the departure of the Resident after paying his periodical visit to Muscat. I have examined the files in my office, and I find that, as a rule, a record of the salutes has not been kept, but here and there an entry appears in the diaries that the Resident or Political Agent either arrived at, or departed from, Muscat under X\\g usual salute, the probable reason being that up to quite latelythe salute was such an established fact that it was not thought necessary to record it, and Dr. Jayakar; who has been here over twenty-one years, has never known an instance, prior to the occasion to which I shall now refer, of the Resident or Political Agent being allowed to leave Muscat without this public mark of recognition. 3. The new departure seems to have commenced with Colonel Talbot’s visit in June last. Colonet Talbot had handed over charge of his office as S E—28-35—June. • 1\ Jf A y f y\ Diseontinaance of the practice of saluting Poltl. OfiScers when leaving Muscat. Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bhushire and was on leave when he arrived at Muscat; a salute was fired on his arrival, but not on his departure. I pointed out to Colonel Talbot that this was contrary to former custom, and he told me that he was on leave and was not entitled to a salute. Again in the following August I proceeded on privilege leave, no salute was fired; I took my departure either at sunset or a little later which I took to he the reason why the salute was not fired. During my absence Mr. Crawford stayed a few hours in Muscat, a salute was given on his arrival, none on his eparture.

I have the honour to observe that this is a departure from established custom and prece dence, and I feel sure that I have only to point 'this out to ensure that Your Highness will accord to the Political Agent both on his arrival and departure those marks of consideration and esteem which the Sultans of Muscat have always shown to the representative of the British Government at their court. I was the more surprised at the omission in the present instance, as, on the morning of the day of my departure, I paid Your Highness an official visit, and, if I remember right, Your Highness was particular in asking me at what hour I should take my departure. * / V ■*.*1 \ J » Is Jk • .Translated purport of a letter from His Highnkss Skyyid Fkysal bin Tubki, Sultan of Muscat, to Major J.

After compliments. —We have received your esteemed letter of the 21st Bajab and have understood its contents regarding what you have brought to our notice in connection with the firing of a salute on your departure from the town (Muscat) in addition to a salute on your arrival. May you know that the rules of official procedure and etiquette are obli gatory and fixed, and that they cannot be changed or added to, and that it is not proper either to add to or to detract therefrom. If your request had only reference to yourself personally, it would not be difficult for us to accede to it and to act accordingly, hut you know that others will require the same and this would be inconvenient. We hope from your universal favours and assistance what we hope for from your kindness, for your position with us is exalted and God forbid that we should lessen it; you are wise and know what is right, and we are very well disposed towards you. No. 5, dated the 13th February 1894=6th Shahban 1311. From — Major J. Hayes Sadler, Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, To—His Highness Seyyid Feysal bin Turki, Sultan of Muscat. After compliments —I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness’s esteem*ed letter of the 2nd Shahban 1311=9th February 1894, and to reciprocate the friendly sentiments you have been good enough to express to- wards myself. 1 regret, however, that the representation I made in my letter of the 29th January has not met with Your Highness’s acceptance. Your High ness is aware that up to August last the arrival of the Political Agent at, and his departure from, Muscat have always been recognised by a salute, and it was be cause I considered that a departure from this old-established ci stom might give rise to misunderstanding, and not because I had any desire that the procedure customary on those occasions should be added to, that I did myself the honour of pointing out to Your Highness in a friendly way that a new departure had been made, trusting that Your Highness would, on my friendly representation, con tinue, not merely to myself personally, but to others who succeed me, the custom which was always followed by your predecessors, and until quite lately, by Your Highness yourself. 3Discontinuance of the practice of saluting Poltl.

This letter is in reply to my letter to His Highness’s address of the 13th instant, and if, will be observed that His Highness now writes that he has never hied a salute on the departure of ihe Political A.geut, and that he suggests that the question he referred to Government and expresses his willingness to abide by their.decision, at the same time he trusts that Government will not decide contrary to what the custom is. 3. With regard to the Sultan’s statement that the custom of firing a salute on the departure of the Political Agent has never been observed by lum, I can only say that it is difficult to reconcile such a statement with the fact, that this custom has been followed by His Highness twice within the last year in my own case, and before my time, also by the present Sultan, in the case of Major Yate, and Captain S|tratton, in accordance with old-established precedent as I have already pointed out. 4. I do not propose to address the Sultan again on this subject until I receive your instructions. r\ L r r\ Translated purport of a letter from His Highness Setyid Feysal, the Sultan of Muscat, to Major J. Hay.es Sadler, Political Agent and Consul, Muscat. After compliments —Your esteemed letter dated the 13th February has been received and its contents are understood. You again represent to us and request us to fire a salute on your arrival as is done on your arrival, that it is customary to do so, and that its omission is liable to misunderstanding. We will not be the cause of any misunderstanding, but with regard to your ^ request we have never followed this custom on departure; the custom between us is to salute in honour of the Consul on his arrival. We all of us abide by this, and Government is aware of it. Your honour is wise and all-knowing. You are aware that it is difficult for us to alter this rule. Ey all means your position is greater and your dignity is higher than that of any other. We hope that, God willing, there will be no misunderstanding. By the strength of the Almighty there will always he love and continued friendship between Her Majesty’s Government and ourselves as before : we will always adhere to that ^ friendship. Refer this question to Government, and if they rule that we should do this (tire salutes on departure) we will consent. God forbid that Govern ment should decide what is contrary to custom.

As the Sultan has expressed a wish that the point should be referred to the Government of India and has promised to abide by its decision, I am to request that the Political Agent may furnish His Highness with information as to the practice which has hitherto prevailed and may explain that any diminution of marks of ceremonial distinction which have been customary between two Governments is regarded as a discourteous act. Should the Sultan not keep his promise to abide by our decision, the Political Agent may, if he considers it advisable, add a hint that, should His Highness fail to be guided by advice, the Government of India might find themselves constrained to consider whether any alteration should be made in the honours at present paid to His Highness.
