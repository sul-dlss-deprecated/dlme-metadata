Territories within the Sterling area as defined by Defence Finance Regulations include w any British Protectorate or protected state. H Definition therefore ? covers all Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms but not Muscat, If Muscat is to be included it should strictly speaking be specified in regulations. 2. We understand that Reserve Bank of India which exercises sterling exchange control in Gulf has always treated Muscat on basis as Shaikhdoms, Can you confirm this ? Principal obligations of membership of Sterling area are that it has to surrender to Sterling exchange control earnings of hard currency in apply(ing) to control for any hard currencies needed for ex penditure. In the case of Muscat control would be exercised by Reserve Bank of India acting presumably through yourself. I imagine that nearly all Muscat's currency earnings must be rupees. 3. There seems to be no reason ? why Muscat should not fur the present at least continue to be treated administrat ively as in Sterling area but we are doubtful whether it is possible or desirable to include it officially by amendment of Regulation. I should however be glad to have your views. RETAXANDUM— jmmm S 2( O.T.P.)

Foreign, New Delhi S. -L Ilici J. J. $ To ' ; Hetaxandum, London. Repeated Repgu, Bahrain and Political Bahrain. No•D.2350-BPG/47• Dated the 9th May, 1947. ^ c '' Reference the Political Resident, Persian Gulf’s express letter No.187-79/^82-I dated the 27th January 1947, addressed to Foreign and repeated to Retaxandum, London, in which he assumed that Dubai was part of the sterling area. 2. There appears at present an unfortunate lack of uniformity as regards Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms in this respect 5 and the anomalous position has arisen whereby Bahrain and Kuwait appear to be generally accepted as within the sterling area, whereas the Trucial Shaikhdcms, and in a recent instance also Muscat, whose relations with His Majesty’s Government differ in no fundamental respect from those of Bahrain or Kuwait, are treated as being outside the sterling area. It is understood that membership of the sterling area is defined for present purposes in the United Kingdom Exchange Control Act, 1947, and it is assumed that Bahrain and Kuwait are at present considered to fall within the sterling area by virtue of item 4 of the definition, viz. 'any British protectorate or British protected State”. This definition does not of course strictly apply to any of the Arab principalities in the Persian Gulf and it may be considered desirable to insert a separate item in the definition, referring to them specifically. In any case, it is suggested that action, on whatever lines may be considered appropriate, should be taken to ensure that all the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf and Muscat are alike accepted as members of the sterling area. The issue of the above has been authorised. Sd/- S.J.L. Olver, Under Secretary to the Government of India.INDIA OFFICE EXTERNAL DEPARTMENT EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL) From Secretary of State for India. To Government of India, External Affairs Department. Repealed to political Resident, Persian Gulf (with 1 spare copy) Dated 9th June, 1947. No.Ext.1097/47. Reference your Express Letter No.D.2350-BPG/47 of 9th May. Inclusion of Persian Gulf States in sterling area. 2. I am somewhat at a loss to understand Statement that Trucial Shaikhdoms and, in a recent instance, Muscat are treated as outside Sterling area, which does not accord with such information as is available here, nor is it supported by Government of India, External Affairs Department Express Letter NO.D.1916-BPG/47 of 22nd April, 1947. I am .advised that in international law Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar and Trucial States under British protection and are automatically included in the sterling area by definition 1 (d) in S.R.&amp; 0. 1946 No.1284. It is not thought necessary to insert a special item in the definition referring to these Shaikhdoms specially. Muscat, being a wholly independent State, is in a different position. It is understood however that the Reserve Bank of India has always treated Muscat on the same basis as the Shaikhdoms and it is proposed that Muscat should continue to be treated administratively as in the Sterling area. Strictly speaking Muscat should perhaps be specified in the Defence Finance Regulations, but on practical grounds it is not considered necessary or desirable to do this. 3. The Exchange Control act has not yet been brought into operation, and Exchange Control in the U.K. continue to be administered under the Defence Finance Regulations.
