Internal affairs, I.—Local Governors and Foreign Office Agents, Famines, etc., 1854—70, A connected account of the internal affairs of Persia from 1854 to 1870, it is not easy to gather from our records. We find only casual references to local Governors and their acts, mainly directed against the British, which does not help us to link together the series of local Governors and their internal administrative acts. The ancient hereditary Chiefs or Sheikhs of Bushire, who played an important part in Bushire politics, for nearly a century* from 1750 * See the Selections from the State Papers regard- ^ ^^5*^ disappear from the SCCHe during thlS ing Persia and the Persian Guif, 1600-1800, and period. Their place was taken by Persian the Precis of Persian Gulf affairs. 1801-1853. r* 1 1 m 1 • 1 • .1 Governors, who while seeking during the short tenure of their office mainly personal aggrandizement, placed every obstruction possible in the progress of British and other foreign enterprise and influence on the coast. In addition to the local Governors, there arises into prominence now at Bushire and Bandar Abbas a Persian officer c&amp;Wed Kargusar, the Foreign Office Agent, whose principal functions were to collect customs on foreign trade, to settle questions arising between Persian subjects and foreigners, to help or rather checkmate foreign trade by every means in his power ; in fact to protect Persian interests against foreign influence. It was to this Foreign Office Agent that the Persian Government insisted on the Resident at Bushire communicating on local questions in which the British were concerned, t Referred to in the correspondence of 1868, and in a letter'}' addressed on 3^ January Proceedings Political a., July 1868, Nos. 168-170. 1 860 by Sir Henry Rawllnsou to Captain Political A., November 1868, Nos. 115-117. 17 i; 4 l j.j. j- ^ 1 _ .belix Jones, the latter was directed to adopt this course. These instructions were, as we shall see below, rescinded in 1868 (paragraph 560 post), as productive of great inconvenience and delay. 2. One striking feature of the internal history of the Persian coast Is the frequency with which seasons of drought occur, followed by famines on a small or jarge scale, and resulting In prohibition of exportation of grain. These prohi bitions were pressed with great vigour against foreigners, while the Persians allowed much laxity In their enforcement to the benefit of Persian dealers and to the detriment of foreign grain merchants. We find complaints made by British merchants on these grounds In the years 1863, 1866 and 1868. The great famine of 1870-72 brought matters to a climax (see section Iv, §§ 5-14 below). 11.—Local Governors : places on the Persian littoral, 1872—74. 3, The following statement, taken from the Persian Gulf Administration Report for 1875-76 with a few additions from those for 1873-74 and 1874-75, contains a list of places on the Persian Coast from Mashur to Bandar Abbas, and shows the Chiefs and Governments under which they are placed.

In June 1870 Sir C. Alison r . , , informed the Foreign Office of the imnenH- mg famme on account of the scarcity of rain. He apprehended serious trouble and riots of the hungry mobs. The Persian Government was not prepared to meet the emergency even to a small extent. ^ 6. On 18th June 1870 Mirza Said Khan addressed a letter to Mr. Alison Political A., August 1870, Nos. 217.319. siating that information had reached the harbours of Pars that no rain having falle^theTcardty^f h^d'was^so great laHn' 1 Th ' Qt ln ^ ab ^ ants of those districts had scattered from fear of star- Ihn K f J t S G , 0 . ve . rn a ment therefore requested that the British Resident exporting grab ^ ' ' e ' Ce t0preVent the English g rain merchants from 7.

For the past two months Bushire lias been crowded with mendicants form all parts and since the outbreak of the cholera in the middle of February^ many of the absolutely poor have succumbed to starvation. The local authorities have attempted to induce the poor to leave the place by bestowal of money and dates, but without success. The destitute have either returned or others have taken their place. Cholera and small pox prevail at Bushire ; the maximum of deaths reported in one day is forty-five and the average number daily about fourteen or fifteen.' 10. In July 1871 Sir C. Alison reported continued prevalence of famine and Political A., July 187., Nos. 463-64. accepted pecuniary assistance from a Charitable Committee m India. 11. In January 1872 the Shah formed a Relief Committee. In the mean- General b ., F.bruar, .s?., No S . 88-90. '''I 6 donations were received from London and India and a famine Relief Fund was started. A committee of European gentlemen with the Resident in the Persian Gulf as chairman took over the administration. 12. Between July 1871 and February 1872 the receipts amounted to 148,507 General E., April .872, Nos. .JS-So. kranS i the expenditure tO 33,775 kranS. On 15th August 1872 the Famine Relief practically closed. The committee submitted a statement of accounts showing a balance of 9,713 krans exclusive of a Reserve Fund for orphans amounting to Rs. 3,000 or 7,260 krans (and ^'1,000 eliminated as unavailable). 13. The following brief account In the Gulf Residency Administration Report Volume m of 1873. 0 ^871-72, especially in connection with the work done by the Relief Committee, is interesting :— ' Every endeavour has been made to counteract the effect of the famine which has raged with such dreadful effect for the last two years. Bushire seemed to be the place where the poor from all parts of the country flocked, and all our endeavours to relieve the distress were futile. In fact the condition of affairs seemed irremediable. The people who arrived here were footsore and in a most emaciated state, some having just sufficient strength to reach the precincts of the Residency and there drop dead. After having failed in distributing food in cooked form, the plan of distributing copper coin was resorted to, but this was also found to be impracticable, and had to be abe ndoned on account of the vast assemblages, the confusion and the consequent abuse of the charity. The Relief Committee in Bushire eventually discovered that employment of labour in making roads in the country, scavenging in the town, and the establishment of an orphanage and infirmaries for the aged and helpless men and women were the best means of meeting the evil, and this course has been attended by every satisfactory results. Bread is daily given to the poor in Subzabad, where the women and children from most of the villages congregate. Relief in cash has also been afforded to many persons of respectability, whom the famine had reduced to poverty. Ispahan, Shiraz, and Kazeroon have also been aided by the funds of the Relief Committee at Bushire. The rainfall has been good, and the prospects of a plentiful harvest are entertained, although the breadth of land brought under the plough is comparatively limited. The funds at the disposal of the Relief Committee will, it is believed, enable them to meet satisfactorily the wants of the poor for the next five months. But fears are enter tained that even after the lapse of this period it will be difficult to throw over those who have hitherto been provided for, and in this view the attention of the Relief Committee in London, Calcutta and Bombay has been drawn to the fact that more funds may still be needed. Khoja Abdul Ghanny Meah, C.S.I., and his son Assad Oollah of Decca, have merited the thanks of the Relief Committee at Bushire and the gratitude of the poor in this place for being the first to extend charity to the unfortunate famine-striken of these regions. Mr. Vurjeevundass Madhoudass and three others have also contributed liberally.IS 8 The Relief Committee in London, Calcutta and Bombay have been very liberal, and there is every hope that their efforts will result in thoroughly meeting the famine in and around this port.' 14. There arose in connection with the wheat, which the British merchants w r ere forced to give away, the question as to the indemnity they were entitled to. They had purchased the stock in April 1870 or before that month, when no notice of prohibition had been given. They had a treaty right to purchase grain Mr. Thompson's Despatch No. i, dated 25th and a special arrangement had been entered M^rehiSe 3 Bubmiucd to Bcmhay oQvernmcnt into between the Mission and the Persian with Colonel Peily s No. 02, dated l.^th April , . 1863, quoted in Foiitica! a., January 18) 1, Nos. Government under which— 280-300 (No. 287). ' Any prohibition in the exportation of Persian produce ought to be determined upon by the Persian Government itself and communicated, through the toreign Ministers at Tehran, to the subjects of their respective Governments.' They were therefore entitled to compensation for the losses suffered on this Political a .. January 1871. Nos. 280-300 (No. occasion. The Persian Government were 299). prepared to pay the British merchants (Messrs. Malcolm and Co. and Haji Musa Meymeni) at the rate of 12 krans per maund, while the latter demanded more. Ultimately a compromise was effected by the Persian Government paying a little more. The British merchants were not quite satisfied with the arrangement and complained, but the Government of India declined to interfere (Foreign Department letter No. 10-P., dated 5th January 1871, to the Bombay Government). V.—Events in 1874-76. 15. In February 1874 the Baharloo Arabs plundered the district of Bandar . T r Abbas to within four farsakhs of the town. Political A., March 1874,^8. 240-247. rp,, • • . i. 1 i 1 1 1 heir intention was to attack and plunder Bandar Abbas. Ahmed Shah, the Governor, was at Minab, and would not move to protect the town. The merchants thereupon armed themselves. Luckily the Arabs did not carry out their intention. 16. Towards the close of 1874 serious apprehensions were entertained, Gulf Administration Report for 1874.75. owing to the unusual drought, that famine Political a ., February 1875, Nos. iSj-gs- might again make its appearance, and the Persian authorities at once imposed an interdict on the exportation of grain. Fortunately the calamity was averted by a fall of rain at last. 17. In January 1875 Assad-ullah Mirza proceeded into the district on his usual annual tour to collect revenue, and experienced some difficulty in obtaining payment from the local chiefs, from whom nothing could be extracted unless a show of force was made. 18. Two popular measures were adopted by the Shah's Government in 1874- 75:- (1) At Bushlre, as well as'at other large towns, a ' box of justice' for the reception of petitions from all classes of people was established, the petitions thrown Into It being forwarded direct to the Shah. (2) The octroi duty hitherto levied at Bushlre on fruit and vegetables was abolished. 19. The Saad-ul-Mulk, lately Governor of Bushlre, left for Shlraz on the nth May 1876, since which date the state of the town and environs were very unsatisfactory. From the 11th May the Aubdhar Bashee of His Highness the Farman Farma carried on the duties of Governor, but was summoned to Shiraz on the 27th June. I9A. From 30th June the Government of the place was entrusted to Agha Mahomed All, the Malek-ut-Tujjar of Bushlre, but, owing to his incapa city from Illness, the work had to be carried on by one of his slaves, who being inexperienced and guided by designing people, could not exercise proper control, and in consequence the subordinate authorities were allowed to act very much as they pleased, and there was no check whatever on their irregularities. In fact, it was only owing to many being unaware as to the actual extent of the Malek's Illness and incapacity that further disorders were not committed.2o. A few of the incidents which occurred within a few weeks at Bush ire might serve to show the disorders referred to. (1) On the night of the 29th May one of the night guards was wounded by a Sirbaz (foot soldier), who was prowling about the streets intent on robbery. (2) On the night of 8th June thieves were said to be going about with crow bars, intending to plunder by force, and their attempts were only frustrated by all parties being warned to be watchful and protect their property. (3) On the night of the 22nd June an Arab, who was passing peaceably to his home, was wounded by a Sirbaz with a sword while in a state of drunkenness. (4) On the night of 25th June a woman was wounded by a Toopchee (artilleryman) while in a state of drunkenness. (5) On the 26th June the Sirbaz seized all the water-melons brought into the market for sale, and compelled all purchasers to pay any price they demand ed. The Yawur in command was unable to control them. (6) On the 27th June the Sirbaz took advantage of the Aubdhar Bashee being recalled to seize all the water-melons brought to the town for sale, giving the owners any price they liked or nothing at all, and selling to the townspeople at high rates. (7) On the 28th June the Sirbaz seized all the water-melons brought to the town and levied a tax of J kran on each load, their Commanding Officer having no control over them. (8) On 30th June the Malek-ut-Tujjar was entrusted with the government of Bushire, and he appointed Kerblai Iwazas Deputy Governor. (9) On 17th July the Sirbaz again attempted to interfere with the water melons brought to Bushire for sale. The Yawur commanding ordered them to desist, and on his proceeding with other Sirbaz to enforce his authority, a melee ensued in which many Sirbaz were wounded. The unruly Sirbaz had eventually to be sent away from Bushire to Behbehan, and the Yawur and Adjutant were directed to proceed to Shiraz. The latter were however eventually allowed to remain. (10) On the 28th July the Sirbaz surrounded the Malek-ut-Tujjar's house, and clamoured for pay and rations, threatening to besiege the place till they were satisfied. Eventually they were pacified by a money payment and written assurances. (11) On the night of 28th July a gang of robbers from Tengistoon made a raid on a melon garden within two miles of Bushire belonging to a connection of Mr. Edwards' servant. They stripped his wife of ornaments and clothes valued at 150 krans, and threatened to kill her unless she disclosed where the money collected by the sale of the melons was deposited. She pointed out the place, and they dug the money out of the ground amounting to 273 krans. While getting away they tried to take away a bullock also, when the gardener sprung up and seized one of the robbers who being unable to free himself called out for aid. The companions of the robber shot the gardener dead and decamped with their booty. In the morning a representation was made to the Malek-ut-Tujjar who telegraphed to Shiraz to the Ihtesham-ed-Dowleh. His Highness sent orders for the better protection of the place, but no attempt was made to seize the culprits, compensate the sufferers, or provide for the widow and children of the murdered man. (12) On the 1 oth August the Sirbaz were again clamorous for pay and rations, and the Yawur resorted to corporal punishment, and was said to have so severely chastised one man that he nearly died. The others sought refuge under the flagstaff of the Turkish Consul. (13) Many robberies in the town were traced to the Sirbaz, but they seemed to be driven to it, as owing to there being no Governor in Bushire, they did not know whom to apply to for pay and rations, and without the latter they could not exist. 8640?DIO VI.—Events in 1877-83. 21.

During his stay, Hyder Khan, the Chief of Dashti, who had not visited Bushire for many years, considered it advisable to put in an appearance, as the force which accom panied the Ihtesham was formidable and His Royal Highness had shown a determination to bring under subjection any tribe which might show an inclination to be rebellious. 22. His Royal Highness Prince Ferhad Mirza succeeded in maintaining Gulf Administration Report for 1877-78 and the security of the routes in a perfectly &gt;878-79. unprecedented manner.

The weekly Persian post, which had been established between Bushire Political a., February 1880, Nos. 167 -69. and the North worked excellently. A census was ordered to be taken throughout Pars In 1874. 25. Haji Ismail Khan, the Deputy Governor of Bushire, was relieved by Political a ., February 1880, Nos. 234.38. Agha Mahomed Bakir Khan. The ' Ihtesham-ed-Dowleh, ' who had a general supervision of all the Southern Districts, visited Bushire in February 1878, and proceeded to Shiraz by way of Dashti and Lar. 26. Mirza Mahomed Khan, for many years Foreign Office Agent at Bushire, was removed, at the instance of the British representative, for mis conduct, and the duties of the office were then conducted by Mirza Abdul Kerim, as a temporary measure. 27. In 1874 died at Bushire the principal Persian merchant, Agha Mahomed Ali, sty|ed u Malek-ut-Tujjar, ' who was reported to be the richest private person In Persia. He died childless, and his property devolved on his elder brother, Haji Baba, naturalized British Indian subject residing at Bushire. 28. In 1875 a grain riot occurred, said to have been at the instigation of certain Mujtahids, or priests, and some wheat belonging to a British Indian subject was plundered. The Acting Resident took prompt and judicious measures, and the ringleaders were arrested, punished, forced to pay the full value of the grain stolen. At bushire, as at other ports of the Persian coast, there was a prohibition on the export of grain, which was very largely evaded. 29. Hyder Khan, Chief of Dashti, who had frequently been a source of annoyance to the authorities, declined to come In to the camp of the Ihtesham- ed-Dowleh at Bushire, but decided to proceed to Shiraz under assurances of pardon for past shortcomings. His brother, Mahomed Khan, presented him self before the Ihtesham-ed-Dowleh, and proposed to supersede Hyder Khan. The latter died at Shiraz, an event which gave rise to what may be considered unfounded, though not unusual, suspicions, 30. Coast fTOin Bushive to —The Shaikh of Kongoon, Mazkoor Khan, was taken to Shiraz as prisoner, and his districts made over to one Mahomed Hassan Khan j but the latter was detected in suspicious practices, and after administration of the usual course of sticks or bastinado, was sent to Shiraz as prisoner, encourager les autres.11 31. Shaikh Mazkoor was reinstated as Governor of Kongoon on payment of 100,000 krans. He paid up a long standing claim for indemnity due to some Indian subjects who were wrecked on his coast. 32. In May 1878 Shaikh Mazkoor, in pursuance with a feud against Abdulla-bin-Mahomed, Chief of Beni Hamad of Kalat, and joined by Shaikh Mahomed Hassan, Chief of Charek, and Hamad-bin-Ismail, Chief of the Abeydil of Cheeroo, attacked and plundered the village of Marbakh, killing seventeen men. The Kowwan-ul-Mulk, Governor of Lar, despatched a force of 200 Sirbaz and 700 irregulars under Aga Fath-Ali Khan of Gerras with one gun against Shaikh Mazkoor in July, but the force was surprised and defeated by Shaikh Mazkoor and his followers. After a desultory warfare Shaikh Mazkoor was seized by the Persian forces in December 1879 and was afterwards executed in March 1883. The Shaikh Hassan-bin-Mazkoor, his son, fled to Bahrain. In April 1883 he landed at Tahri and caused considerable Gun Administration Report for .883-84. d i s t ur bance8 in the Gillahdar and adjacent districts, and Fath-Ali Khan Gerrasbee, Governor of Lar, was ordered to act against him. Some Persian infantry and a body of Baharloo Irregular Cavalry accordingly proceeded to those districts. Hassan bin Mazkoor, however, fled and escaped. Subsequently, further disturbances occurred in Gillahdar and Gaobandee from the people refusing to receive a new Governor, named Naib Ibrahim Khan, one Ahmed-bin-Saif being the ringleader. 33. Naib Ibrahim having proceeded to Jam with a force of sowars and infantry to suppress a revolt there, serious resistance was made by the people of Jam, and in the affray several of the Baharloo sowars were killed. On this the Persian infantry and the sowars plundered Jam. Subsequently some thirty or forty men of Jam were seized as being guilty of the blood of the Baharloos, and made over bound to the Baharloo, by whom they were cut to pieces. A large number of camels, sheep, ami donkeys, etc., were taken from the people of Jam. 34. A severe earthquake occurred on 16th October 1883 on the Persian coast which was felt at Bushire, Kongoon, Asloo, Tahri, etc. Much damage was done at Kongoon and other coast villages, where shocks continued to be felt until October 24th. 35. The wealthy Persian merchant of Bushire, Haji Baba, above mentioned, died in May 1883, and his grandson and heir received the titles of Malek-ut Taj jar and Rais-ut-Tujjar. VII.—Administration of Lingah and Bandar Abbas, 1882-83. 36. In 1882 His Majesty's Minister at Tehran was informed by the Shah's „ %T Government that the Government of Pars Political a., August 1 83, os. igi-igy- was en t rU sted to His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan. As a matter of fact it was found that all the fiscal and administra tive arrangements which existed then had been taken over by Saad-ul-Mulk, who was an agent for the Amin-es-Sultan who resided at Tehran. At Bandar Abbas the only recognized representative of the executive authority was one Nasrullah Khan, who was a representative of Saad-ul-Mulk. 37. In May 1882 the Native Agent at Lingah forwarded to the Resident a copy of the rules promule^aled by Saad-ul- Pohtical A., June 1882, os. 104-113. Mulk, which among other innovations provided for the appointment of a permanent committee of merchants to decide all mercantile cases at that port. The arrangement, the Resident thought, would entail serious and objectionable alteration of the status of British defendants. On representations being made at Tehran, Saad-ul-Mulk was ordered to abstain from the action complained of. 38. In April 1883 Mahomed Hassan Khan was appointed Governor of _ ^ Bandar Abbas and Lingah. He was a a., Political Junai 3, os.-4-2 . brother of Saad-ul-Mulk, a nominee of Amin-es-Sultan, who had again farmed revenues and customs of Bandar Abbas and Lingah directly from the Shah.12 VIII.—Events in 1885—1892. Scarcity in 1886-88. Important proclamation, 1888. 39. Although the rainfall of 1885 was abundant, the crops were again Page 8 of Administration Report of the Gulf attacked by rust and the harvest was Residency for 1886-87. consequently scanty. Great distress pre vailed in Shiraz culminating in a severe bread riot in July 1885. On this occa sion the Persian Telegraph Office was entered by the mob and wrecked, and the persons of the telegraph officers were for a time in considerable danger. Throughout the districts of Shiraz much disorder prevailed and robberies and outrages were very frequent. The Kashkai and other lis were completely out of hand, and plundered without fear, and with impunity. This state of things was intensified by quarrels between the El -Ilkani, Sultan Mahomed Khan, and the Eel-Begi, Darab Khan, neither of whom collected or paid the State revenues. 40. Private dissensions also existed between the Salid Diwan and his nephew the Kawwam-ul-Mulk, which, doubtless contributed much to keep up disorder in the town and districts. The strife between the relatives led to the downfall of the Kawwam-ul-Mulk, who was taken to Ispahan and put in chains. The Il-Begi, Darab Khan, also encountered similar fate, and the affairs of the Koshkai lis were entrusted to the Il-khani. 41. Owing to the previous year's scarcity of harvest prices rose at Bushire Administration Report tat 1887-88. V? n . earl &gt;' fami . ne P ltch and the Outlying districts were m an unprosperous and con sequently unsettled conditions. This was aggravated by intrigues conducted from Shiraz, in view to compassing the dismissal of Nasir-ul-Mulk from the Governorship of Bushire. 42. Exportation of grain from Persian ports was prohibited from gth December 1888 by notification from Tehran. 43. A royal proclamation was issued in 1888 by the Shah promising respect Gulf Administration Report, 1888-89. ^ 0r ^5 !^ ert * e f an ^ 'ghts of his people and permitting the formation of companies, etc., for the improvement of roads, commerce, etc. The Resident in his Administration Report for 1888-89 observes : ' The effects of this measure are not yet palpable, but owing chiefly to increased intercourse wirh Europeans and inter change of ideas with them, there is a gradual amelioration of the condition of the people in progress, and the Royal proclamation is a sign of the times at all events, and may yet bear fruit.' 44. It was the intention of the Shah to visit Pars at the end of 1891, but Gulf Administration Report for 1891-92. owing to the prevailing scarcity, which the presence of a large following would have increased, the idea was abandoned, when prices began to fall. 45. In spite of an excellent harvest in the plains country the export of grain ibid. was prohibited in June 1891, but all 'con- , tracts entered into before the passing of the orders were allowed to be carried out. IX. Events in 1896-97. Disturbances at Bandar Abbas, 1893. 46. His Royal Highness the Rukn-ud-Dowleh, Governor-General of Fars de ( alt f ? rely u With the Kawwan-ul-Mulk 1 0, * , , referred to above, a powerful hnf »n^ pu ar Shiraz noble, who was the chief landed proprietor in the province and r''fl ^ t t 6 1 . Arab L tribeS - The Kawwan-ul-Mulk shortFy afterwards proceeded to Tehran, whence he was directed to retire to Meshed. 4 u /u 6 revenue colle ctions were largely in arrears, while the state of the dis- tricts had been most unsettled; robberies and murders by the Arab nomad bemg frequent: one of these tribes, the Baharloo, aggrLed at tLir ^t- ment by the Governor of Darab, went into outlawry in October 1802 Tronn«! were sent agamst them from Shiraz under the Il-khani, and they moved wkh13 their families towards Bandar Abbas, closing the trade routes, plundering cara vans, and spreading the greatest alarm by their depredations almost up to Bandar Abbas. 48. His Majesty's Ship Cossack was ordered from Bombay for the pro tection of British subjects at Bandar Abbas, where she remained until all danger of an attack was over. Persian troops were sent from Bushire and other coast ports in the S. S. Persepolis, and the Prince Governor of Kerman was ordered to intercept the rebels from the north. The Arabs retreated and no fighting took place. The troops then returned and traffic on the caravan route was resumed. Pardon was offered to the Baharloos by the new Governor-General on condition of their future good behaviour, and probably the return of their patron, the Kowwan-ul^ Mulk, from Meshed contributed to their pacification. The Governor of Darab was arrested. 49. The epidemic of cholera, which raged virulently in the northern parts of Persia, did not penetrate further south than Shiraz. It first showed itself at Iklid, six stages from Miiraz, having followed the caravan road from Meshed, thence it spread gradually to Fasa and Niris. Comparatively few cases occur red at Shiraz itself, but it was not until December that the disease finally died out. The mortality at and round about Fasa was about one thousand five hundred ; at Istabanat and Shiraz two hundred each. 50. Disturbances occurred in 1892 in the Bushire district owing to feuds between Khan AH Khan of Bandar Rig and Muhammad Khan of Rudhilla, and to the discontent of both with the Governor, whose policy it was to play off one against the other. Muhammad Khan of Angali, however, was murdered in a blood feud, and his rival appears to have made his peace with the Government, 51. In December 1892 Jafar Khan, the Zabit of Dilam, was said to be evading payment of revenue, and thirty soldiers were sent by the Deputy Gover nor of Bushire to arrest him. The townspeople rose in his favour and a fight ensued in which'the soldiers were worsted. Jafar Khan was afterwards replaced by the Zabit of Reshire. 52. In July 1892 a Bahrein boat lying off Kasr Konar was plundered by _ ttA , .. t D q eleven armed men at Bandar Tibbin, and Gulf Aamimstration Report for 189-293. . . , 1 1 t-. cash and goods, valued at Rs. 880, were stolen. Application for redress was made to the Prince Governor of Fars, but without result. 53. In August 1892 a determined attack was made on Kasr Konar by the A1 Bu Fakhara, who formerly farmed it, but were supplanted by another tribe and immigrated to El-Katr, where they have resided for the last eighteen years. According to the accounts received seven of the inhabitants of Kasr Konar were killed and property valued at 70,000 krans was carried off. In retaliation the Kasr Konar people shortly afterwards seized three boats belong ing to El-Katr. A complaint of this was made by Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani, but he was informed that unless he prevented such outrages by people within his jurisdiction, he must expect reprisals, 54. An embargo on the export of wheat was published in May 1893 and ^ 1C AJ . . , r&gt; o continued nominally in force till the follow- Gulf Administration Report for 1803-94. • t i • i r™ mg January, when it was removed, ' The measure,' observes the Resident in the Gulf Administration Report for 1893-94, ' which is of periodical recurrence, though injuriously affecting the regular operations of the more important merchants, who are Europeans, is very generally recognized, as being practically ineffectual. Any real restraint on export from the rich corn producing sea-board tracts from Bushire towards the mouth of the Euphrates, would be most difficult; and even if seriously intended or attempted, would be hardly practicable, in view of the fact that scarcely any other means than by sea are available for disposing of the produce. A thinly veiled and ^wa:«-surreptitious export is understood to be carried on at Bushire itself during these embargoes.' S640FD14 The districts near Bushire were again subject to some trouble and disorder in 1893. Khan Ali Khan of Bandar-Rig Gulf Administranon Report for 1893-94- having farmed Angali and other villages in Dashtistan, was resisted by the inhabitants, and Angali holding out after the submission of the others, was attacked in 1893 t ^ e support of a gun from Bushire. In Tangistan there was a still more serious conflict, and Hyder Khan though assisted by a detachment of Persian soldiers and a gun, failed against the Tangseri tribe, who, armed with Martini-Henri rifles, compelled the soldiers to retreat under their steady fire. X.—Events in 1894-97. 55. The beginning of the year 1894 saw a revival of the vexatious and useless embargo on the export of wheat. gulf administration report for 1894-9s* rr^i .. . i ji 1 The action taken was sudden; it was unexpected also in view of the fact that the previously existing embargo had only been removed three months before; indeed, everything connected with this mischievous measure was irregular, capricious, and uncertain. Difficulties at once arose in regard to stocks for export already purchased or contracted for, and were not arranged without much trouble. British merchants protested and v the newly-appointed Governor, immediately on his arrival, sought our support in representations at Tehran against the measure on the ground of its uselessness as regards its ostensible object—the relief of scarcity at Shiraz,—which the miserable state of the road and the cost of transport practically barred, and the injury to the producers in view of the abundant harvest in the coast districts. A certain remedy for the situation after Persian methods was soon found in an extensive evasion of the edict, considerable shipments being made with very transparent secrecy, with the result that export to the value of over ^ 1 ,000 was effected during a year over three-fourths of which the embargo rested. So good a harvest would, however, doubtless have produced a heavier export under normal conditions, as the uncertainty and vexatious demands to which the trade was liable could not but operate to materially restrict it. 56. In 1895 Bushire and the Gulf ports were placed under the adminis- 0 ^ trative control of His Excellency Kowwan- gulf administration report for 1895-96. i n/r n l , ^ i .1 1 c ,1 ul-Mulk, but towards the end of the year a very determined cabal was forced against his authority. The ostensible cause seized upon to bring matters to an issue was an imprudent attempt to construe as an order for peremptory deportation, and to carry out with some indignity, instructions from the capital suggesting the desirability of the temporary absence from the country of the titular head of the mercantile community, the Malek- ut-Tujjar who thereupon at once took refuge in a neighbouring shrine known as the Imam Zedeb. This aroused the greatest excitement and a very general and vigorous popular demonstration was easily got up. Bazaars, shops, and offices were closed, and business came completely to a standstill and the people besieged the Persian Telegraph Office day and night in large crowds, after the manner of the populace in Persia whose first resort in times of public disturbance or panic is to the telegraph. No haste was shown by the Central Government to take measures to allay the excited popular feeling by the issue of clear orders, but it gradually became apparent that the cause of the malcontents gained ground. First, the Hamal Bashi, who had been allowed to draw in his own hand altogether too many functions and too much power, and who had become the object of very general resentment, suddenly fled, and this was followed early in March by the resignation by the Kowwan-ul-Mulk of the Governorship a fort night before the vernal equinox from which all changes and new appointments in Persia date. Temporary and imperfect arrangements for the divided control of public affairs were somewhat tardily made, but these nevertheless, owing to the fact that the popular party was in the ascendant, sufficed to maintain order. 57. In 1895 an attempt to transfer the sole charge of a tract in Dashtis- Gulf Administration Report tor 1893-06. ^ t0 , 0f tlle C !' iefS . Who had Hitherto shared it, was resisted by the other, Ahmed Khan, who shot his rival dead, A punitive expedition was then organised under instructions from the capital, a detachment with a, small naval gun being /15 sent out. Ahmed Khan being joined by some of the people of Tangistan and Shabankara was able to maintain his resistance, till a small reinforcement was despatched, and at the same time, orders to effect an amicable settlement. He was then induced to present himself at Bushire with a strong armed following and received a firman from the Governor investing him with the authority in dispute. At Tahiri on the coast Shaikh Ibrahim resisted by force the transfer to another of the post he had held, and maintained his position in the fort, neces sitating the despatch of a considerable force for his expulsion. At Lingah some alarm was caused by the violence of one Syed Yusuf who, having killed a man, evaded the attempt made to arrest him, and brought a party to the attack of the fort. A more vigorous attempt at his arrest under the direction of the Kowwan-ul-Mulk also failed, as did an effort to induce him to return to Lingah. In the early part of the year there was much uneasiness in Bushire in conse quence of the frequent acts of robbery and violence in the immediate neighbour hood. 58. Grain export again lay under a nominal embargo throughout the year. „ , „ , It was freely evaded for most of the Gulf Administration Report tor 1805-90. • i • 1 1 r i * t. 13 period; indeed one ot its objects would appear to be the opportunity afforded by it for the levy of an illegitimate cess for connivance at its evasion without an open violation of the treaty rights governing the duties in foreign trade. 59. His Highness Hissam-es-Sultaneh, who, on the fall of the Kowwan-ul- , . . . „ , o * Mulk at the close of the year 189=5-96, Gulf Administration Report for 1896-97. • . i . . i ^ ,• r was appointed to the Governorship 01 Bushire and the Gulf ports, proceeded in a very leisurely manner to the seat of his authority, not arriving at Bushire till the middle of June. His earliest difficulty arose in connection with the transfers of certain of the coast districts and villages from the authority of Khan Ali Khan to that of Hyder Khan, a step which was strenuously resisted by the former, whose death however a few weeks later tended to smooth matters. 60. In autumn Hyder Khan was afforded the aid of troops, with guns from the Persian gunboat Persepolis to coerce his people and recover revenues, and later, further reinforcements followed. There was a collision between the opposing forces, and a deputation of the people then came in, and a compromise with some authorities was effected. Hyder Khan being himself pressed for a payment under this compromise, a month later, presented his pistol at the dele gate, who thereupon returned, followed by the troops and guns to Bushire. 6t. The Hissam-es-Sultaneh's rule was marked by an utter neglect of ali the duties and obligations oi his office. The arrangement in its financial aspect, as regards the payment of the revenue, with which alone in this as in similar cases the Central Government concerned itself, having been taken up by the mercantile coalition which had ousted the Kowwan-ul-Mulk, the only incentive to the Governor to burden himself with public affairs, largely disappeared. Power w 7 as accordingly wielded by others, with all the abuses and disadvantages which attach to authority covertly exercised. Nor was this the only evil, for His Highness Hissam-es-Sultaneh's tenure of office was itself constantly in jeopardy, the result of financial difficulties, with the Government, and in December he officially notified his resignation to the Residency, and declined to transact business. The difficulty not only of con ducting official business, but of securing redress in cases urgently demanding it, was perhaps never more acutely felt than during this regime; irresponsible secretly exercised influence aggravated the malpractice and abuse ordinarily existing, and the ill results were exhibited in many directions. 62. Luristan was the scene of much disorder. Shaikh Ibrahim, aforetime Governor of Tahiri, attacked the palace with his followers, but lost heavily and was repulsed. The Baharloos and nomad Arab tribes also attacked Jam and spread violence and rapine throughout the district. An attack on Lingah was threatened, and some fears appear to have been felt even at Bandar Abbas.i6 63. Kishm Island was visited by a terrible calamity. On the night of the nth January an earthquake laid the town in refuse, only two musjids and three or four other buildings being left standing. Sixteen hundred bodies were reported to have been recovered from the ruins, besides those of strangers which were not identified. Shocks were felt as far as Lingah to the west, and on the neighbouring island of Larak where some loss of life was also reported. 64. The harvest in 1896-97 was a failure, only 7*98 inches of rain having Gulf Aa m !n islr aiion Report fo, .897-98. been registered at Bushire during that period, so that there was not sufficient grain to meet local requirements, and the country had to depend upon heavy exports of rice, especially from Burma. Prices yet stood very high. ' It is a proof,' writes the Resident on the Gulf Administration for 1897-98, 'of the increase in property of Bushire during the past 25 years that in spite' of these high rates there has not been actual famine and it has not been necessary to provide, public relief.' 64 A. In view of the prospect of a famine, the Resident applied for and External A., December 1897, Nos. 54-58. obtained the sanction of Government for . . _ . r. .. . t ^ e unexpended surplus of Rs. 14,000 of the Famine Relief Fund referred to in Section IV above being spent for the relief of those in distress (No. 1783-E.A., dated 23rd November 1897). . There was however a timely fall of rain in March 189R, though the winter rains had held off, with the result that a severe and extensive famine was averted. XL—Events in 1897—1902.

Another source of danger to Bushire is the neighbourhood of the Tangistanis, a tribe inhabiting the hilly broken country which lies between the lofty tableland of Iram and the fiat strip of sandy shore between the foot of the hills and the sea. Tanoistan as its name_ implies, consists of a succession of ' Tangs ' or defiles and m an almost impossible country fcr regular troops to enter. Sir James Outram forbore to pursue the defeated enemy when they had retreated into this region after the victory of Khushab, and the thorough conquest of the tribes who occupy it would be a difficult undertaking, especially now that they are generally armed with breech-loading rifies. The Tangistanis played an important part in the defence of Reshire Fort in the campaign of 1856-57, and they have f °[ m ?'y ,y ear 5, k 66 ' employed as irregular troops by the Persian authorities. The Malek-ut-l ujjar had several in his'pay, and it has been the practice among the Persians to play off one tribe against another, and to employ one leader to coerce another. Accordingly, towards the close of 1897, Hyder Khan a Tangistam leader was deputed to punish Ali Khan, another who had not paid his revenue. ^ Hyder Khan being successful, his opponent came to Bushire and took Bust or sanctuary at the Imamzada, a shrine near Reshire. He had a large number of followers with him, and it is said that they committed many of the numerous violent crimes that took place in the early part of 1808 As there were reasons to apprehend that an attack would be made on the teleeranh station, and on Europeans^ generally, a small party of Blue-jackets was landed in March, and were retained till an addition to the Resident's escort of ss sepoys arrived from Bombay. The position of affairs at Bushire at that time gave rise to some anxiety, as the small garrison had been reduced by the despatch of some ISO regulars to the Mekran coast, and the Governor -General was directed by the Persian Government to send a force from Shiraz to coerce the Tangistanis. After considerable delay some 800 men were sent under thp command of the Said-us-Sultan, an officer on the staff of the Farman Farma.»7 66. It is not necessary to enter into a detailed account of his proceedings, ^ ^ . L ,. q n and it is sufficient to state that little was Gulf Administration Report for xogB-QC). , , i i • . i i. J done beyond harrying the country and levying revenue. A few men were executed, but the popular opinion was that they were not the real criminals, and ransoms were taken from wealthy persons who fell into the hands of the ' Army.' The expedition was believed to have been financially a success, but it is doubtful if it had much lasting effect on the Tangastanis, or if any punishment reached those really to blame for the troubles which occurred in the early part of 1898, The Said-us-Sultan came to Bushire on the 20th May, and took up the post of Governor. He was recalled, however, immediately afterwards by the Governor-General, and returned to Shiraz with the greater part of his troops. It will be remembered that the Tangastani leader, AH Khan, was believed to be the instigator of the attacks on the Bushire Residency, and on Mahmond, the jemadar of the Telegraph Department, whose relatives were killed and whose house was looted in March 1898. Immediately after these crimes, Ali Khan fled from the Imamzada where he had been in ' Bust,' and returned to Tangistan, His enemy, Hyder Khan, joined Said-us- Sultan, and having made a valuable present to him was confirmed in his posi tion of Tangistani Governor. Ali Khan hearing of this fled to a port higher up the coast, with the intention of going by sea to Basra. No attempts being made, however, to seze him, he returned to Tangistan, from where he com menced writing to Mahmond and to the Residency declaring his innocence and threatening that, if the efforts which were being made against him were not relaxed, he would come in and take ' Bust ' with Mahmond. It should here be explained that this custom of taking Bust ' is carried in Persia to such a length that an accused person can enter the house of his accuser, who is bound to receive him, and unable to take any steps against him, while he is in ' Bust.' Ali Khan did not eventually go to Mahmond's house, but applied to the Residency authorities, stating that he would come in and surrender himself, provided he received a fair trial, and that a promise was given him that he would not be handed over to the Persians. The Resident, Colonel Meade, was at that time away from Bushire at Shiraz, and Mr. Prideaux, Assistant Resi dent, agreed to Ali Khan's proposal. He came in accordingly, and an investi gation, which was held, pointed strongly to his connection with the crimes which occurred while he and his followers were staying at the Imamzada. Claims therefore of 4,000 tomans were put forward by the Residency as compensa tion to those who had suffered. Ali Khan would probably have paid the amount, but he wished to be assured that he would not be molested afterwards by the Persian Government. This assurance the Residency were unable to obtain, and Ali Khan was told that as he had come in on the safe-conduct of a British officer, he was free to leave the Residency, where he had been living for six months, whenever he pleased, but that as he bad not paid the compensation demanded, an endeavour was made to recover it through the Persian Government, to whom he was subject. A formal demand was made by the Minister at Tehran. Ali Khan owned considerable landed property on the Bushire Island, and the out rage on Mahmond originated in a dispute over a waterway. It had not a politi cal object, and Mahmond was attacked not because he was a British protege, but for personal reasons. 67. On the 22nd August 1902 it was reported that Saiyid Yusuf Mehrkani, a partizan of Shaikh Muhammad Joasmi, Gmf Administration Repon for 190203. who had seized Lingah a few years pre- viously but was soon expelled by the Persians, had arrived from Arab coast at Dooan on the Persian side. A few days later it was reported that he had seized and burnt 40 packages of dates which belonged to the Persian Government and were being brought to Lingah from the interior. The Deputy Governor of Lingah took steps to defend the place and the latest news received about Saiyid Yusuf was that he had left Persia and crossed over to Katar. His Excellency the Salar-i-Moazzim arrived in Lingah on 17th October in the Fersepolts and landed with some troops from Bushire and a ship's gun. He is said to have recovered a fine of 6,000 dollars from Shaikh Yusuf bin Ahmed of the Bu Smeit tribe and his brother whom he had arrested on the charge of having favoured the cause of the rebel Saiyid Yusuf and to have then released them, taking from them a paper in which they declared their allegiance to the Persian Government.

In 1853 we find his son, Khalifa bin Khathib, as Shaikh at Lingah. He was succeeded by his son, Said bin Khalifa. When Said died, his son Khalifa was very young, and Khalid bin Sultan of Shar gah appears to have managed the affairs of the place, until he became of age. Sheikh Khalifa having died in October 1874 was succeeded by his young son, Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa. 69. The youthful Shaikh of Lingah did not find himself on a bed of roses, as the Persian Government was disposed now to interfere more directly than of yore in the affairs of the district and wanted to have more revenue. 70. In November 1878 Ali bin Khalifa was murdered by one Yusuf Khan,who Political A., February .879, N. s . 358-369. had been appointed by Khalifa guardian or his son, but was dismissed by the latter. Yusuf Khan's proceedings were not disapproved by the Persian author ities and he was left in charge of the Government as Deputy Governor. 71.

Sheikh Yusuf fled to Bassidore, and thence to Kishm. Lingah continued in a very unsettled state until September, when Shaikh Khatib applied to the Joasmi chiefs of Oman for armed assistance. The Residency agent at Shargah, however, warned the chiefs of Shargah and Ras-ul- Khyma against interference in matters relating to the Persian coast, and nothing resulted from Sheikh Khatib's action. 72. Shortly after the Governor of Bandar Abbas, 'Shazada Mahomed Hus- sain Mirza, arrived at Lingah and confirmed Shaikh Khatib as Governor, fixing the yearly revenue at 190,000 krans. 73. The population of Lingah were in favour of the Arab Governor Shaikh Gulf Aministration Report for 1887 * 88. Khatib, but his tenure of office was very External d a,, November 1887, Nos. 36-38. precarious : the Persian authorities in pur- k«:™a a i t o f a [ ec r. adop i ed p olic y had resolved on the abolition of the system of Arab Governors at Lingah and the abasement of the ruling Arab family. Haji Ahmed Khan was entrusted with the task of capturing Shaikh Khatib, and on 16th September succeeded in surpising the Shaikh and effecting his object with very slight joss of life. Shaikh Khatib was carried to Bushire and the property of the family was virtually confiscated. A Persian official was then placed in charge of the administration at Lingah. 74. Barracks were erected at Lingah and a body of 200 Persian regular infantry placed there much to the disgust of the inhabitants, some of whom prepared to leave the place and settle in other parts of the Gulf. A considerable number of families actually migrated to the adjacent coast and islands. 75* ^ was at this time that the island of Sirri was annexed by the Persian Government (see Section XXVII). 76. Since this time. Lingah has been under the government of a Persian Governor appointed under orders from Tehran or Shiraz. 77. In 1897 Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, a descendant of the former Gulf Administration Report for 1898-99. Arab Sheikhs, attacked Lingah, and easily c j , , . S ot possession of it. No damage to speak of occurred to the subjects in consequence of this revolution, and it seemed likely at one time that the Sheikh would establish himself finally in place of his ancestors, and that the Persian Government would accept the situation and acquiesce in the restored Arab rule. Such was not, however, the case, as the ersians appear throughout to have been resolved to reassert their authority, ccordingly m February 1899 the Persepolis went to Lingah conveying the Dana Begi and a small force, The Shaikh was led to believe that his object was19 to recover arrears of revenue, and when he had paid up the amount demanded, he believed himself safe and dismissed the greater portion of his followers. An attack was then suddenly made and Lingah retaken by the Persians. 78. When the bombardment of Lingah was going on, H. M. S. Secret E., June .899, No S . 357-66. Sphi was at Bassidore, and on hearing the noise of the firing, it proceeded on the 2nd March 1899 to Lingah and landed an armed party under Lieutenant Robinson for the purpose of guarding the British Agency and protecting the British subjects. As, however, the Darya Begi informed him that he held him self responsible for the protection of British subjects and their property, and the town on the west of the fort was quiet, and no Banias having come to claim protection, the guard was withdrawn and they returned on board. Only Lieuten ant Robinson and a signalman remained on shore. On the morning of the 3rd the Arabs evacuated the fort and the Sheikh fled the country. 79. On 14th October 1899 the British Minister at Tehran was informed Secret r., November 1899, Nos. v-?. by the Sadr Azam that Sheikh Algmed* •Probably two of the followers of Mahomed. and SaiyId Yusuf,* who Were alleged tO have been responsible for the recent rising at Lingah, had escaped to the Arabian coast, that the Shah feared that they might return with a new following and hoped that the Indian Government would take such steps as could prevent their collecting men with a view to making a descent on Lingah. 80. The Government of India in this telegram, dated 21st October 1899 instructed the Resident to warn the trucial chiefs not to assist any schemes for an attack on Lingah, and to communicate to the Legation any information he might receive respecting such designs. 81. Again in January 1900 the Persian Government complained that Shaikh Secret e., March 1900, noc. 176-85. Mahomed had taken refuge at Ras-ul- Secret e ., May ,900, No . ,3-59. Khyma and harboured by its chiet, and the latter intended to make an hostile demonstration against Lingah in aid of Shaikh Mahomed. The Persian Government intended to take measures to chastise the Arab chief, but before doing so asked the British Government to intervene, 82. The Resident, who was asked to report, stated that the trucial chiefs had been warned in October 1899 against assisting in any schemes for renewed attacks of Lingah, that the warning was repeated when Colonel Meade visited the Arab coast in December. Sheikh Humeid of Ras-ul-Khyma stated that Shaikh Mahomed's attack on Lingah was made against their wishes, and that they had lost in consequence properties which belonged to the tribe generally. Sheikh Humeid promised to conform to the Resident's advice and said that he would submit later on detailed claims for the property of Joasmi Arabs taken by the Persians in Lingah. The Resident now sent the Melpomene with a fresh warning to Sheikh Humeid to give up all idea he might have of making a descent on Lingah. The commander of the man-of-war was also instructed to prevent any such attempt. On the other hand the Darya Begi, the Resident thought, had not the means to attack Ras-ul-Khyma effectively : any attempt to do so might result in the loss of the Persepolis (Resident's telegram, dated 28th January 1900, to the British Minister at Tehran). 83* The Commander of the Melpomene conveyed the necessary warning to Sheikh Humeid and was informed that there was no foundation in the rumour about the intended descent on Lingah. Shaikh Mahomed was found at the time at Ras-ul-Khyma. 83A. Shaikh Mahomed bin Khalifah bin Said, ex Chief of Lingah, came to AdminWratio,. Report for .90304. Lingah in 1903 and made an attempt to settle in the country, but having failed to get a sufficient guarantee for his safety, he left for Katar towards the end of November 1903.

Claims of the Imam of Maskat to the islands of Kishm and Ormuz, and Bandar Abbas and its dependencies. British position and jurisdiction at Bassidore. XIII —Early history. 84. The most exhaustive account we have got in our records of the origin of the title of the Imam of Maskat to the islands of Kishm and Ormuz, and to Bandar Abbas and its dependencies is contained in a letter of Dr. Jukes, dated Q4th August 1821, then Political Agent at Kishm. ( 2 The Bini Maainee tribe originally resided at Koong on the Persian coast, and it is now about 70 or 80 years since Shaik Abdulla Maainee took the island of Kishm from Mulla Aly Shah, who was then chief of the island, on behalf of the Persian Government | and Shaikh Abdulla, afterwards farmed Bunder Abbasee and its dependencies from Nadir Shah. 3. The Bini Maainee tribe remained in possession of the island for many years, and after Nadir Shah's death, continued to pay tribute to the present reiguing family ol Persia for Bunder Abbasee and its dependencies which they still retained. 4. About 26 or 27 years ago the inhabitants of Kishm, being dissatisfied with the tyrannical system adopted towards them by Mulla Hussein Maainee, their chisf and Governor, solicited His Highness Saiyid Sultan, the Imam of Mnskat, to take the islands under his Government and control ; the Imam proceeded accordingly with an Army, and by force of arms took possession of the islands of Kishm, Bunder Abbasee and Ormuz, from Mulla Hussein, and it has ever since remained under the general control of the Imam of Maskat. 5. Saiyid Sultan, notwithstanding he had taken these places by force of arms from Mulla Hussein Maainee, continued to farm Bunder Abbasee and its dependencies from the Persian Government, as the Bini Maainee tribe had done before him, and his son Saiyid Saeed, the present Imam of Maskat, continues to do the same ; he pays four thousand Furmauns annually for the town and dependencies of Bunder Abbasee, including Meena Humeel and Khumeer. Syfe bin Mubhaun, an Arab chieftain, is at present Governor of Bunder Abbasee on the part of His Highness the Imam, and his younger brother is the Governor of Ormuz. Shaikh Abdul Rahman Maainee, the Governor of Kishm is related to His Highness by marriage, so that the Government of all the principal places farmed by the Imam of Maskat is entirely in the hands- of the Arabs at present, and I do not know whether the Persian Government would venture to risk the attempt of taking these places forcibly from them under any circumstances, but as the Imam has several ships and could command the sources of a great number of buggalas and boats belonging to the different Arab tribes in the Gulf, it is almost certain, I think, that the Imam would be able to retain the islands of Kishm, Ormuz and Larak, in spite of every exertion of the Persian Government, 6. The whole of the Persian shore of the Gulf is in the possession of different Arab tribes, and though they may have little differences and quarrels among themselves, they would cordially unite to repel any attack the Persians might make to accept or subdue any one of them. 7. It is quite impossible that the Arab tribes and the Persians can ever cordially blend their interests and act in concert together. The habits of the people are very different the independence of an Arab Shaikh submits reluctantly to the Persian yoke, and the difference of religious feeling effectually prevents anything like a cordial co-operation between them. 8. I regret extremely that neither at Maskat, nor at Kishm have I been able to obtain a sight of one of the old Persian Farmauns by which His Highness the Imam farms Bunder Abbasee from the sovereign of Persia, in order to ascertain what places are particularly specified as constituting its dependencies. I think it unlikely that such an important document as the grant, or Farmaun of the King of Persia, by which His High ness the Imam farms so large a portion of territory and for which he pays 4,000 tumans annually should not be in existence; it is possible it might have been mislaid at the time I was at Maskat, or it might have been intentionally withheld, but I was expressly in formed by Saiyid Abdul Kahir, His Highness's confidential Secretary that neither Kishmji Ormuz, nor Larak, are specified on the receipts annually granted by the Persian Gov ernment, for the stipulated sum paid to them ; and in reply to a series of questions which I wrote out to be answered at Maskat, and which I know were carried by Saiyid Abdul Kahir to His Highness the Imam himself, it was expressly declared that the islands of Kishm, Ormuz and Larak belonged exclusively to the Imam. 9. It appears to be extreme presumption in the Persian Government to declare that even Maskat itself is a dependency of Persia, and the information I have obtained satis fies me that Maskat never was tributory to that State ; perhaps the pretentions of Persia may be grounded on the following circumstances, which I obtained in detail from what must be considered the highest authority, the Imam himself. S640FD42 10. About 78 years ago Sultan bin Syfe Gaarubi was Imam of Maskat and the Province of Omaun ; he made himself very unpopular by his tyranny, and was removed from the Government by the general voice of the people, he went and sought the aid of Nadir Shah, then sovereign of Persia, to reinstate him in his Government; Nadir Shah complied with his request, and sent an army back with him to restore him to influence and to power. This army landed at Ras-sul-Khyma, and after much hard fighting they succeeded in marching through the country as far as Maskat which place alone seems then to have been retained by the adherents of Sultan bin Syfe, while all the Province of Omaun remained unsubdued. The independent Arabs now advanced and surrounded Maskat, and the Persian Army was reduced to considerable difficulties. About this time intelligence of the death of Nadir Shah reached them ; the Persians made certain proposals to the Arabs, which were finally agreed to, and the Persian Army returned back to Bunder Abbasee without effect ing the object of their coming. 11. In this state of affairs Ahmed bin Saed the grandfather of the present Imam of Maskat, and then a chieftain commanding at Sohar, assumed the Government of Omaun and was proclaimed Imam. 12. The claims of Persia therefore to the islands of Kishm, Ormuz, etc., seem to rest entirely upon their being considered as dependencies of Bunder Abbasee. This point I have not yet been able to ascertain, but it is quite evident that the Imam is not disposed to acknowledge the right of Persia to the islands in question, and it is, I believe, the universal law of nations to claim as a right that which they have obtained by the sword. Persia with equal presumption claims the island of Bahrein because it was once tributary to it, though it has thrown off the yoke, and paid no tribute for these 30 years. Persia may with equal justice lay claim to Dehli at the present day because Nadir Shah once conquered and plundered it. 13. In my discussions therefore with the Persian Ministers I think I shall be able, in point of right, to support all the measures the British Government have adopted in occupy ing the island of Kishm. When I consider, however, the very heavy expense of supporting the establishment, the impossibility of employing the troops on any active sservice in the Gulf for four months in the year on account of the excessive heat, the sickness that has prevailed there ever since the hot weather commenced, and the inefficiency of the force arising from that cause alone, I confess I feel more doubts than I have heretofore done, as to the expediency and utility of the measure ; but as I am aware that different sentiments have been and probably still are entertained by those who are far more competent to decide than I am, I beg to offer such a hint with extreme diffidence and with the most perfect conviction of the fallibility of my own judgment.' 85. It appears from our contemporary records that the island of Khism was occupied by the Bini Maainee Arabs under their leader Sheikh Abdullah during the reign of Nadir Shah, while the famous Mulla Ali Shaw was the admiral of the Persian fleet with his head-quarters at Gombroon. We have got no contemporary account to show whether it was seized by force by these Arabs from Mulla AH Shaw But it is improbable that they could have held it independently of the central authority during the reign of Nadir Shah, whose conquests extended as far as even as Maskat. 86. From the Selection oj State Papers regarding the Persian Gulf, 1600-1800 (Nos. CI I, CV, CXI, CXXI), it appears that the Bini Maainee Arabs always acted in opposition to Mulla Ali Shaw, while the latter called in aid against them the julfar (Joasmi) Arabs. Nasir Khan, the chieftain of Fars, once the rival of Karim Khan and latterly almost an independent Governor nominally acknowledging the Vakil's authority, befriended the Bini Maainee Arabs. 87. During Karim Khan's reign Sheikh Abdulla, the chief of the Bini Maainee Arabs, made himself quite independent, in their possessions the islands of Kishm and Ormuz, of the Persian authorities on the coast, however friendly he was with Nasir Khan, Governor of Fars, or with Sheikh Nasir. Governor of Bushire. He was believed to have shared the property plundered by certain Arabs ffom the ship Islamabad, and to punish him for this crime and to make him disgorge this plunder, an expedition was despatched by the Resident of Basrah (Henry Moore), which ended disastrously in the explosion of one of the British ships off the Kishm island. What is important to note in this connection is that the expedition was undertaken with the avowed purpose of bringing Sheikh Abdullah under the authority of Karim Khan {Selections from State Papers regarding the Persian Gulf, 1600-1800, Nos. CLXX and CLXXI). 88. 1 he Maainee Arabs farmed Bandar Abbas and its dependencies from the Persian Government. It is not clear whether these dependencies included the islands of Ormuz and Kishm, nor does it appear from our contemporary records ^hen the farm was taken. If as Dr. Juke's account goes to show that it was23 Nadir Shah that gave the lease, then their subsequent tenure of Bandar . S bbas must have been very precarious, as Mulla AH Shaw was practically supreme at Gombroon until he was seized by Nasir Khan in 1852 (No Laii in my Selections, 1600-1800). We find him at liberty soon after, and his power at Gombroon was so great that he could have left little room to his enemies the Bini Maainee Arabs. 8q. Sheikh Abdullah Maainee exercised however at the same time supreme power in Kishm island at least for a time. In 1753 Abdul Sheikh, Governor of Kishm, as he is called by the Resident, proposed to sell a Persian ship to the Siddee at Maskat. this Nasir Khan was anxious to prevent by all means, which he however was powerless to do, and it was^ only the despatch o wo British ships by the Resident at the urgent solicitations of Nasir Khan that saved the vessel from being taken to Maskat {Selections, No. LX ). qo. It is very improbable that Sheikh Abdullah could have got ^ a farm of Bandar Abbas and its dependencies before the removel of the British factory from Gombroon in 1763, since if this was a fact, it would have been referred to in the Gombroon diaries of the time. For many years after this Sheikh Abdullah as we have seen, adopted such an independent and hostile attitude against Karim Khan that it was unlikely that until the latter's death in 1779 any inhu e was paid by Sheikh Abdullah to the Persian authorities. After Karim I ban s death there reigned so much confusion in Persia until Aga Mahomed final y established his power over the ruins of the Zand dynasty in 17^5, tha the Bini Maainee Arabs increased their hold in the islands of Kishm an Ormuz. Their fleet of ships was at a time a terror to the 111 ( e I&lt;r • ' It was probably during the period of confusion that followed the death of Karim Khan that the Bini Maainee Arabs, obtained possession of Bandar Abbas and the ports close to it, for which they must have later on begun to pay a rent to the central authority in Persia, as it became consolidated. qi. In 1708 the islands of Kishm and Ormuz and Bandar Abbas and the towns near it were taken by Saiyid Sultan, Imam of ^ Maskat. The following account is given in the ' Imams and Saiyids of Oman edited by Badger ' Sultan went next to es-Sweaik, which was then in the hands of his brother, Said bin el Imam and captured it, and from him he also took el-Masnah His next conquest was Shakhar (Chahar) of Mekran, after which he attacked el-Kasum (Kishm) and reduced r Then after a reconciliation was affected betwixt him and Bin, Maainee, the people of el-Kasum, he attacked it again ; he also attacked Harmuz, the port of winch island belong- ed to Mulla Hasan el-Mainy and took both places.' ^ , 02. No mention is made in this account of the Kishm Arabs having invited Saiyid Sultan. Reference is made to his reconciliation with them and a sec-n aftarck-of the island. , . ■ , o. Soon after this Saiyid Sultan farmed Bandar Abbas and its dependen cies but from all accounts it is clear that Kishm and Ormuz were not specih- c allv mentioned^ the grants. The presumption would be that a large island like Kishm would have been specifically mentioned, had Ae grant included it in addition to Bandar Abbas and its ' dependencies,' which included the coast near that town and perhaps the islands close by under the control of its Governor, ■which was not the case in regard to the island Oi Kisfim. 04. Soon after Saiyid Sultan had acquired these territories a treaty was concluded with him by the British (istli October 1798), in which Bandar Abbas is referred to as a port ' of this Sirkar,' that is the Imam of Maskat ; and there occurs the following article; r ,. u u n i-. /t ' In the port ot Bandar Abbas (Gombroon), whenever the English shall be disposed tn establish a factorv, making it as a fort, 1 have no objection to their fort.fymg the same r „, nt; n c, ™ns thereon Is many as they list and to forty or fifty English gentlemen and monntin „ ^ ■ 1]t hundre d English sepoys ; and for the rest the rate of dnUe's on goods, on buying and selling, will be on the same footing as at Basrah an CK On the death of Saiyid Sultan in .804, and during the troubles result- ino from the succession being doubtful for a time, the Bin.

After the capture of Ras-ul-Khyma in 1820, it was resolved* to remove the British detachment to the island of Kishm. This was done with the express written permission of Saiyid Sultan. Various places were occupied on the island for the purpose, namely Kishm town, Deristan, Salak and finally Bassidore. The Persian Government protested very strongly. His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran pointed out that after the punishment of the Joasmis, it was necessary to keep some British troops in the Persian Gulf, and the Imam of Maskat was willing to allow of a British Settlement on the islands of Kishm or Henjam. To this it was answered by the Persian Government that Maskat was a dependency of Persia and as the Imam had not the power of permitting the residence of British troops at Maskat, he could much less grant such a permis sion at Kishm as Henjam which were the dependencies of Bandar Abbas. As pointed out by Sir Monstuart Elphinstonef ' the King of Persia's claim to Kishm does not. appear to be strengthened by his present arguments, but on the contrary to be weakened by His Majesty's Minister making in part depend on his sovereignty over Maskat, a pretension which seems to be entirely untenable.' 97. As the Persian remonstrances against our settlement on the Kishm island became very persistent and threatened to bring about a rupture of friendly relations, it was decided to remove the detachment from Bassidore. This was done in 1822. But as no other station in the Gulf could be found more convenient for a ' naval depot and rendezvous for our cruisers' Bassidare station was again occupied in 1823. No protests were apparently raised against this second occupation, which has continued since undisturbed. (As regards the subsequent history of our station at Bassidore see sections XX and XXXV.) XV.—Resumption in 1854 of the lease of Bandar Abbas, etc., to Maskat and regrant in 1856. 98. About the close of the year 1854 the Persian Governor of Shiraz despatched a force to Bandar Abbas, which expelled Saiyid Sultan's Gover nor of the place Seif bin Nebhan and his officials and garrisons from the fortified posts on the coast held by them, occupied them by force and committed great outrages upon the inhabitants. Saiyid Sultan greatly enraged at this aggressive act of the Persians despatched an expedition under the command of Saiyid Thoweni, who succeeded in recapturing the posts. 99. The Persians, however, on receiving reinforcements marched again to the coast. The Beni Yas Arabs were appealed to by Saiyid Sultan and pre pared an expedition to aid the Saiyid forces. This was however prevented by the British Commodore from proceeding to Bandar Abbas in pursuance of certain general instructions that had been issued by Colonel Kemball. This proceeding was approved by the Resident on the ground that the whole Gulf would be involved in a maritime war if one of the tribes had been allowed to aid Saiyid Sultan, as the Joasmi Arabs being hostile to him would have in j Truciai chiefs Precis, Chapter . ^ likelihood proceeded to assist the t See Aitchinson'.

TreatieSi called for an authentic Copy of the agreement. Revd. Mr. Badger, the well-known Arabic scholar, who was then engaged on the Maskat-Zanzibar Commission, obtained— ' a copy of the treaty referred to on the original Persian, together with an English translation of the same from an Arabic version, furnished by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat.' 101. In Revd. Mr. Badger's translation, article 12 restricted the grant ' to the person of Saiyid Said, who is now living, and to his children' (ouLad) In article 4 the privilege of selection of a Governor is vested in the ' Imam and his sons.' In 1864 Colonel Pelly submitted translation of the agreement made from the Persian original, which was inserted by Mr. Aitchin- son in his Treaties. It differs slightly from Badger's translations, but both agree on limiting the terms of the farm to Saiyid Said and his sons.

J -u , , „ , o&lt; Felly at first reported, on the authority No 47, dated 21st March 1867, 1,1, rr-i of two independent but unomcial sources, 'that the Persian Government had consented to farm Bandar Abbas and the adjacent districts to the present Sultan of Muskat, as they did to his late father.' 103. A fortnight later he reported that the Persian Governor of Fars had , ^ 0 , communicated to him the wish of the No. 5*1 datad 5th Apni p ers i an Government that Saiyid Turki, the younger brother of the deceased Sultan, should be nominated Governor of Bandar Abbas, in which case the lease would be continued, though at an increased rent. The Prince Governor in this communication brought forward the argument that Saiyid Salim, as grandson of Saiyid Said, could not continue to hold under a lease granted only to Saiyid Said and his sons. 104. This argument was reiterated by the Prince Governor at an interview See Colonel Felly's letter No. 106, dated 5th which Colonel Pelly had with him in the September 1867. course of the next few months. The Prince informed him that the lease of Bandar Abbas had been renewed at an enhanced rate of 20,000 instead of 16,000 tomans in favour of its former Arab Governor, Sheikh Said, a relation of the Maskat family, but as a direct dependent of Persia, and not in his capacity as representative of Maskat. 105. The neighbouring port, Lingah, which had been included in the original lease, was about the same time made over in name to Hajee Ahmed, late Vizier of Maskat, but in reality remained in the hands of its former Arab Governor. The Hajee Ahmed thus mentioned had now again been received into favour by Saiyid Salim. 106. Matters remained in this state till the spring of the year 1868. Throughout the winter Saiyid Salim was too much occupied in the difficult task of securing himself in the Government of Maskat to be able to devote attention to the former dependencies of his family on the Persian side of the Gulf. 107. The Persian Government, however, found that they had a by no means submissive lessee in Sheikh Said. Their demands for the balance of tribute were rejected by him, and, accordingly, the Prince Governor of Fars set out for Bandar Abbas with the view of coercing him. 108. The Shah was much alarmed by the aggressive attitude of the Maskat Arabs, and requested the good offices of the Government of India for the pro tection of Persian territory and commerce. 109. In reply Mr. Alison was informed that the Sultan of Maskat had too much difficulty in maintaining his position to be of any cause of just apprehen sion to Persia. S640FD26 i IO. The Persian Government being however informed of Saiyjd Sallra's determination to blockade Bandar Abbas in consequence of their a refusal to renew the lease of that port, claimed the mediation of the Government of India. Thereupon Sir S. Fitzgerald, Governor of Bombay, proposed, and the Gov ernment of India agreed, to instruct Colonel Pelly to the effect that his good offices should be used to procure a renewal of the lease, and that meantime hostilities must be suspended. Mr. Alison had urged^ the despatch of a ship- of-war to the scene of the threatened collision, but with this reqest Sir Seymour Fitzgerald was unable to comply, as there was no vessel then available at Bombay. 111. Letters subsequently received from Colonel Pelly confirmed the in telligence of the intention on the part of Saiyid Salim to make a naval demonstra tion along the Bandar Abbas coast, and the desire on the pan of the Persian Government to assume the direct management, a nephew of the Prince Governor of Fars being made Governor of Bandar Abbas. 112. The Report from Colonel Pelly, No. 56, dated 9th May 1868, showed that he was, according to his instructions, endeavouring to mediate between the two parties, and was about to meet the Prince Governor for the purpose of arranging matters. The Persian Government had expressed a desire to keep Bandar Abbas in their own hands, but at the same time an apprehension that they could only do so with success if the British authorities intervened to prevent the Sultan from attacking the port. The Shah quite contemplated the possibility of his being compelled to renew the lease in case the British Gov ernment declined to intervene for the protection of his authority at Bandar Abbas. 113. We might quote the following paragraphs from Colonel Pelly's report, n , , a t o&lt;q vr in which he expresses his views upon Pohtical A., June 1868, Nos. I47-49* •. . • j r i u the situation and the policy we should follow:— 8. The position the Sultan would now take up seems to be thus -That the Convention under which the late Imam consented to farm Bandar Abbas in 1856 was forced on him under emergent circumstances, and that the late Imam would not have given in, had it not been for the then Resident in the Persian Gulf preventing some of the Imam's Arab allies from assisting him. and. —That if the Persian Government be willing to renew the Convention, he, the present Sultan, would be willing to come to reasonable terms; and this, although a question of fact, the Sultan denies that the term of the original lease is expired. jrd —That if the Persian Government refuse to come to terms concerning the lease, the question of Bandar A'obas, as between Maskat and Persia, reverts to the position in which it was prior to the Convention of 1856; in other words, that the Sultan would in such case assert the Bandar Abbas districts to be Maskat territory, and appeal to force in support of his claim.. 9. It appears to me very desirable, in the general interests of peace and trade, that the matter should be amicably arranged, as proposed by His Excellency the Governor. But if this cannot be done, I do not see my way of advising Government to interfere to the prejudice of the Sultan of Maskat. 10. I beg respectfully to express my entire concurrence in the view taken by His Excellency the Governor, that it is for our interests, and, indeed, I would add, for the interests of trade in general, that the Bandar Abbas districts should be administered from Maskat rather than by the Persian Government. u. His Excellency in Council will observe from the book of Treaties that on a Vide 'Thomas' Book of Treaties' published in former occasion we have admitted Bandar 1851, page 314. Abbas to belong to the Imam of Maskat. 12. I think we should be careful how we allow Persia under any new arrangement to imply or assert claims to questionable territory, especially insular territory^ and most especially the islet of Angaum, which last Maskat asserts to have always belonged to her. and which even the Convention of 1856 does not include among the territories specified as being leased from Persia. 13, I think further we should object to Persia entering in any fresh lease a clause excludmg strangers. The territory must either be Maskat or Persian, and even if it be the latter, our subjects have still a treaty right to reside there, to trade there, and to purchase household property. . I t' t i 1S in Counci1 Wlll &gt; moreover, bear in mind that it is the arrangements made by the British Government at heavy cost which alone render trade in the Persian P osslble : Persia has ^ a war stick afloat. Were it not for us, the Arabs wouldplunder her coast and not allow a Persian boat to put to sea. It seems strange that a kingdom so circumstanced along her sole and only ocean sea-board should venture to exclude strangers, or lay claim to sovereignty over islands. The islands, it is true, may in point of distance be nearer to the Persian than to the .viaskat coast; but channel islands are usually found to belong to a naval and not to a purely military power. 114. The Government of India's instructions and observations on this are _ ..... 1 » 7 Q &lt;o m contained in their letter No. 6^4, dated Political A., June 1868, No. 150. , T ^ OT , 19th June 1800, to the Government of Bombay :— In reply to your letter No. 132, dated 9th June, and with reference to previous correspondence, I am directed to communicate to you the views of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General in Council regarding the lease of Bandar Abbas. 2. Having regard to the terms of the 4th and 12th Articles of the Agreement concluded in 1855 between the Persian and Maskat Governments as contained in the copy of the original Persian Agreement forwarded with your letter No. 124, dated 31st December 1864, His Excellency in Council is inclined to the opinion that the lease of Bandar Abbas, etc., for 20 years was not limited to Saiyid Said and his sons, as stated in Colonel Felly's translation^ but included any Ruler directly descended from the loins of the then Imam who might be on the throne of Maskat within the period of 20 years for which the lease was given, 3. At the same time, with reference to the attitude now assumed towards each other by His Majesty the Shah and the Sultan of Maskafc, His Excellency in Council is of opinion that the present dispute should be adjusted with reference rather to what is equitable and right, than to the rnert terms arranged in 185$. His Excellency in Council considers it highly desirable, both in the interests of the trade of the Pursian Gulf and on other grounds, that the lease to Maskat should be renewed, and that the Resident in the Persian Gulf should mediate between the contending parties on the terms that the Sultan of Maskat should hold Bandar Ahbas on a reasonable payment. 4. Under no circumstances can His Excellency in Council countenance a resort to hostilities by either party } and should the Sultan of Maskat commit aggressions on any of the Persian ports, the Resident should insist on the cessation of hostilities, pending a settlement of the dispute by mediation, for which the British Government have already tendered their good orfices. Meanwhile His Excellency in Council will await with interest the report of Colonel Pelly's interview with the representatives of the Persian and Maskat Governments. 5. With reference to the views expressed b}- Colonel Pelly in paragraphs 11 to 13 of his letter of gth May, His Excellency in Council cannot consider the stipulations in our Treaty with Maskat of 1798 for the exclusion of the French and Dutch from Gombroon and the establishment of an English factory there as affecting in any way the rights of Persia \ nor can His Excellency in Council approve of intervention on con ditions which do not recognize the Sovereign rights of Persia over the territories embraced in the engagement of 1855. It is, therefore, immaterial whether in the new lease the clause excluding strangers be maintained, as that clause would in no way effect British subjects who have Treaty rights throughout the whole of the Persian dominions, 115. In the meanwhile the Government of Bombay had instructed Colonel . _ , n , 0 K Pelly not to object to the blockade of Political A., October 1868, Nos.34-35- Bandar Abbas by the Sultan of Maskat, but to inform His Highness that, after the offer of mediation by the British Government, such action could not but be regarded as unfriendly. The Gov ernment of India when apprized of this telegraphed to the Bombay Govern ment to issue more emphatic instructions to that officer to leave nothing undone to prevent the threatened blockade, and to give the Sultan to understand that the British Government would withdraw all countenance whatsoever from him if he refused the proffered mediation. 116. On the 2nd August 1868, Colonel Pelly telegraphed to say that Maskat had placed the negotiations entirely in his hands, and that an explicit telegram had at length been received from the Shah, giving a general consent to an amicable arrangement of the matter. He himself was moving up with the Maskat Agent to meet the Persian Prince Governor of Fars at Shiraz, and matters, he thought, would probably be satisfactorily arranged if the Persians were reasonable in their demands. 117. From Colonel Pelly's letter of a previous date, viz., 23rd May, No. 63, it appeared that the Sultan was willing to come to reasonable terms, though he denied that the terms of the lease of 1856 had lost their force, and28 was not indisposed to appeal to force In support of his claim, declaring that nothing had prevented his ancestor from asserting the sovereign rights of Maskat over the disputed territory, but the action of the British Government in prohibiting the Arab alies of Maskat from rendering assistance Upon this the Government of India replied that subsequent to the date of Colonel Pelly s communication our views had been made known by letter and telegraph, and that that officer would no doubt shape his course accordingly. 118. A later letter of Colonel Felly's, dated 8th ultimo, No. 70, conveyed the information that the Shah had apparently estimated the Bandar Abbas revenue at 60,000 tomans, and that the Sultan would consent to an increased payment from 16,000 tomans to 25,000 tomans, inclusive of all demands, such as douceurs and irregular payments to Persian officials. In this communication it was mentioned that the Sultan would accept a renewal of the lease as regards those territories only which were specified in the former lease to the exclusion of the islands of AngauM uud Lufruck, which, His Highness asserted, were not included therein. 119. On the 18th August a telegram was received from Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran asking for the precise views of the Government of India with reference to the mission of Colonel Pelly, who, with the Maskat Agent, had arrived at Shiraz. The Persian Government it was stated, were not dis posed to admit of British Interference on the one hand, and on the other the Maskat Agent, while making no definite propositions, used threatening language. Matters besides were complicated by the introduction of the question of sovereignty over the island of Angaum in such a manner as to arouse the suspicions of Persia regarding our own good faith in the matter. 120. Mr. Alison was informed in reply that we desired the renewal of the lease of Bandar Abbas and its dependencies to Maskat on equitable terms, the rights of Persia over the whole territory, including Angaum, being at the same time clearly recognized. Persia, we observed, had in the first instance invited our interposition in her behalf, and could not therefore now decline our mediation. And we added that, if Colonel Pelly's presence at Shiraz was con sidered objectionable, he would be withdrawn, but in that case it would be necessary to depute to him a high Persian official empowered to conclude terms. 121. The Bombay Government were at the same time apprized of the Government of India's views, and attention was drawn to the case of the island of Angaum, which throughout the correspondence about the removal there from Mussendom of the Telegraph Station was regarded as a portion of Persian 1 territory. 122. On the 25th August a telegram was received from Colonel Pelly through the Government of Bombay, to the effect that the Persian Government had openly declined our mediation, that the Maskat Agent would endeavour to open negotiations direct, but that there appeared small chance of success. In the event of failure, Colonel Pelly urged that no further restriction should be placed on the action of the Sultan of Maskat, unless we were prepared to guarantee that Persia on her part should not reinforce the coast districts or receive naval assistance from abroad. A naval demonstration would, Colonel Pelly thought, at once bring Persia to terms. As regards Angaum, he feared lest the Sultan might take exception to the separate arrangement of which it had been the subject between Persia and ourselves. 123. The Bombay Government expressed their concurence with Colonel Pelly's view that Maskat should no longer be prevented from enforcing her claim by 'blockade, and added that there would be the less objection to this course, inasmuch as efficient British vessels of war would be soon present in the Gulf. ^ 124. But as we were indisposed to countenance in anyway a disturbance of that peace of which the British Government had assumed the guardianship, we under date 26th August telegraphed our opinion that, if the question were confined simply to the conditions of the renewal of the lease of Bandar Abbas and its dependencies, the Persian Government would probabty come to terms.29 We desired therefore that negotiations on this basis should be attempted through Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran ; and we declared explicitly that in no case could the Sultan be allowed to undertake hostile operations against Persia. 125. On the 20th July 1868 Colonel Pelly despatched a telegram to d i-&gt;- t a rw 1. oao xt announce the renewal of the lease. The Political A., October 1868, Nos. 212-13. . ...... rr i circumstances in which this was enected are detailed in the following letter of Colonel Felly, dated 10th August 1868, No. 96 I have the honour to continue and conclude the subject of the lease of the Bandar Vide my letter No. 94, dated S 6th July ,868. Abbas districs to Maskat 2. On the evening of the 27th July, the Prince Governor General of Fars opened conversation with me regarding the lease. I replied that since the Shah's Government had declined British intervention, I could not discuss the subject officially, but that, since the Sultan of Maskat had entrusted the guidance of the negotiation entirely to my hands, I should be happy to communicate to His Royal Highness my thoughts on the matter in an unofficial manner. 3. The Prince then said that the Shah had confided the disposal of the affair to him and we agreed that a rental of 25,000 tomans a year for the lease of seven years, on the otherwise terms of the old lease, would be fair. The Prince added that, if the Maskat Minister should concur in this view, he would be glad for the Minister to call on him the following morning. 4. Accordingly the Minister went the next morning to the Prince's Wuzeer, and, accompanied by him, waited on the Prince, taking with him a written document confirm ing my terms of the previous evening ; and these terms were then agreed to : the Prince, however, stipulating for a sum of three thousand tomans per annum on his own behalf, and of one thousand tomans per annum on behalf of his Wuzeer, these additional demands being, he considered, just in return for the great trouble and outlay he and his Wuzeer had incurred in regard to the Bandar Abbas difficulty. The Prince further requested the Maskat Minister to inform me of the arrangement thus made, and to beg me to submit ' Your message of twenty-eighth very satisfac- Viceroy that the question was thus dis- tory, and the Viceroy thanks you for your success- posed of. On this assurance, confirmed by the ful exertions.' Prince's Wuzeer, I forwarded my telegram of the 28th July, and received from the Foreign Secretary a reply as per margin. 5. On the evening of the day following (29th), the Maskat Minister had another inter view with the Persian Wuzeer, and documents were drawn out in the above terms, the one for the Shah's lease of 25,000 tomans, the second for the 4,000 tomans per annum to be given to the Prince and his Minister. It was furth'er arranged that, on the following morning, the Maskat Minister should again wait on the Prince, when the articles of lease would be sealed and exchanged. 6. The Maskat Minister went to the Prince accordingly, but it appeared that during the previous night the latter had received an unexpected telegram from the Persian Gov ernment at Tehran, enjoining him to demand 30,000 tomans per annum for the Shah. To this fresh demand the Maskat Minister declined to assent, and the negotiation was for the moment in abeyance. 7. On the evening of the 31st July, the Prince Governor invited me to a garden, where he again resumed the subject of the Bandar Abbas lease, explaining to me the unexpected character of the fresh orders from Tehran, and assuring me that, under any circumstances, I might rest confident he would support the message which he had request ed me to forward to the Viceroy, 8. While sitting with His Royal Highness, I received from Mr. Alison a telegram, stating that the Persian Government wished me to persuade the Maskat Minister to consent to the demand for 30,000. And I then suggested to His Royal Highness that if he and his Minister should deem well to forego their local demands, I doubted not I should be able to induce the Maskat Minister to consent to the full demand from Tehran ; and it was arranged that I should communicate with the Maskat Minister, and inform His Royal Highness of the result. 9. On the following morning (rst August), accordingly, I received from the Maskat Minister, and transmitted to the Prince's Wuzeer, a document consenting to pay the full 30,000 on condition that no other demand were made on him, whether at Shiraz or else- S640FDJ s* 30 tvhere. I telegraphed the Maskat Minister's consent to Mr. Alison ; and transmitted also to His Excellency a telegram from the Minister to the address of the Home Minister for Persia, confirming his consent, and begging that orders might be issued to the Prince Governor to conclude the transaction. 10. On the 3rd August I received from Mr. Alison a telegram assuring me His Excellency would do his utmost to support the intended arrangement. 11. On the same evening also I received from the Prince Governor a letter informing me that he had instructions from the Foreign and Home Ministers to conclude the Bandar Abbas lease, and that the Maskat Minister should attend the next morning for the pur pose of signing the articles of agreement. 12. Accordingly on the morning of Tuesday, the 4th August, the Maskat Minister waited on the Prince's Minister, and thence proceeded with him to the Prince's residence, where the deeds of lease were sealed and exchanged. The Prince further caused telegra phic orders to be sent to the Persian Governor of Bandar Abbas to make over charge and vacate, and ordered the despatch of a special messenger to Bandar Abbas with •'Your telegram of fourth. Viceroy considers written instructions. My telegram of the 4th the settlement of the Bandar Abbas lease question embodied these proceedings, and I had the honour satisfa-tory.' j-g receive from the Foreign Secretary a reply as per margin. 13. On the evening of the same day I received from Mr, Alison a telegram informing me that the Home Minister had stated that orders had been issued to the Prince Gover nor to conclude. 14. On the evening of the day following (5th), I took my leave of the Prince, accom panied by the Maskat Minister and by the English gentlemen resident at Shiraz. Prince then renewed his assurances of his satisfaction at the prompt and satisfactory termination of the Bandar Abbas difficulty, and requested me to inform the Sultan of Maskat by telegram. He added that he considered the terms in all respects fair, and that it was on all accounts desirable that the lease should have laDsed. 15. No allusion was made throughout the discussions to the subject of Angaum. 16. As regards the proposed creation by Persia of a flotilla in the Persian Gulf, the Prince said he entirely concurred with me in thinking it would prove an unnecessary expense and a costly failure. He said Persia entrusted the peace of the Gulf entirely to the British Resident, and that he would be prepared to issue any orders I might draft in view to my securing full support and prompt communication from the local Governors along the Persian coast line. 17. On taking leave of the Prince he begged me to accept an ornamented kalian (pipe) headpiece made after a device of his own, adding that he was causing a mouthpiece to be made for me of the same pattern. He said that he trusted I would keep and use these as mementos of our pleasant intercourse during my visits to Shiraz. His Royal Highness was pleased to pay some other personal compliments, with which it seems un necessary to trouble Government. I replied that, under the rules of the India Office it would be necessary for me to intimate the gift to the Government of India, and that it they should permit, it would afford me gratification to keep and use a kalian presented to me in so flattering a manner by the Hissam-us-Sultaneh. 126. The territory, which is the subject of the bargain, comprises 'the Gov- ernment of Bandar Abbas, the islands of Kishm and Hormuz, the districts of Yureen, Tazian, Shumal, Minab, and Birjaban. and the port of Khumeer and all their dependencies:' Such is the wording in the Agreement on the part of Saiyid Salim. In the document which intimates the release on the part of the Shah the territory made over is less clearly defined ; thus ' Bandar Abbas with ' its islands the districts of Yureen, Tazian, Shumal, Minab, and Birjaban and the port of Khumeer.' Nothing is said in either paper about Angaum. ^ 127. Colonel Pelly it will be seen announced that Persia had no longer a desire for a flotilla in the Gulf. The Shah was content to leave the maintenance of the maritime peace to the British Resident, as in this way there is less expense and less chance of failure. ^ XVII. Lapse of the lease on the Azan bin Ghias turning out Saiyid Salim 128. In the lease of 1868. the grant of Bandar Abbas. Kishm and other Political A., June 1869, Nos. 410M21. places, was made only in favour of w nu- . A o • •, ~ Saiyid Salim and his heirs. When Aran bin Ghias turned out Saiyid Salim, the lease ceased, as he was only a collateral relation of the ex-Sultan. The Persian Government taking advantage of this3i fact, appointed Haji Ahmed, once a Minister of Saiyld Salim, to the charge of Bandar Abbas and its dependencies with the view of forwarding its own enterests. The Indian Government on hearing of this, instructed the Resident not to take any steps in the matter till it should be clear who should eventually be ruler of Maskat, as the reasons still existed which had induced it to desire that Bandar Abbas should be attached to that principality. The Secretary of State in his despatch No. 7, dated 30th July 1869, whilst admitting that Azan bin Ghias had no claim whatever to a continuance of the lease, did not desire that the Govern ment of India should trouble itself with the matter. XVIII.—Proposed renewal of the lease during the reign of Saiyid Turki, 1871-72. 129. When Saiyid Turki came to power, he applied for Colonel Felly's assistance in arranging for the lease of the Bandar Abbas districts. Colonel Pelly asked the instructions of Government. In a despatch No. 30 of 23rd May 1871, to the Secretary of State, the Government of India wrote:— ' As regards the lease of Bandar Abbas, we have to remind Your Grace that in our Secret despatch No. 31, dated 27th May 1870, we solicited the instructions of Her Majesty's Government on the question whether we should hold out to Azan any hopes of the exercise of our friendly offices with Persia for the purpose of obtaining the restoration of the lease of Bandar Abbas. To that despatch no answer has arrived. The present claimant, Saiyid Turki, is not a descendant of Saiyid Salim, and,ftherefore, he cannot claim under the lease of 1868; and although he is a son of Sultan Said, with whom the engagement of 1855 was contracted, yet the agreement of 1868 having been made with facto Government of the day at Maskat, may not unreasonably be considered to have superseded that of 1855. an( l&gt; in virtue of the termination of the engagement of 1868, Persia has already entered into possession of Bandar Abbas. For these reasons we consider that we should be justified in declining to interfere in behalf of Saiyid Turki any more than in that of Azan bin Ghias. At the same time the British Government might, in our opinion, advantageously and without committing itself to interference, make an endeavour to sound the Persian Government as to the likelihood of a restoration, as a matter of favour, of the lease to Saiyid Turki, who has always been supposed to be a favourite with His Majesty the Shah.' 130. With reference to the despatch No. 27 of 23rd May 1871, to the Secretary of State, the India Office addressed the Foreign Office :— 'The Viceroy enquires whether Her Majesty's Government are prepared to exercise their good offices with the Government of His Majesty the Shah of Persia to obtain the restoration of the lease of Bandar Abbas to Saiyid Turki. With reference to this question, I am to state that the Duke of Argyll was prepared to recommend the renewal of the lease in favour of Saiyid Azan bin Ghias, had he remained supreme at Maskat. And His Grace is of opinion that there are still stronger reasons for using our friendly offices on behalf of a member of the family of Saiyid Said. He would, therefore, suggest that Lord Granville, if he should see no reason to the contrary, should place himself in communication with Mr. Alison, with a view to his obtaining from the Persian Government the restoration to the present Ruler of Maskat of the privilege in question.' 131. The Foreign Office, accordingly, issued in July or August 1871, a despatch to Mr. Alison, Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. ' The Governor-General of India has called the attention of Her Majesty's Govern ment to an application which has been made by the present Ruler of Maskat to be recognized as such by the British Government, and that they should use their influence with the Persian Government to obtain for him a renewal of lease of Bandar Abbas.' ^ Various changes have taken place in the Government of Maskat since the lease was renewed in 1868 to the then existing Ruler, the Persian Government appear to have con sidered that agreementas terminated by those changes, and to have again entered into possession of Bandar Abbas. It will, however, be known to the Persian Government that, whereas some objection was raised at the time to renewal of the lease to Saiyid Salim on the score that he had obtained sovereignty of Maskat by usurpation and violence, no such objection can be urgid against the present Ruler, who is a son of Sultan Said with whom the Persian Government entered into an engagement in 1855, that he should farm the port of Bandar Abbas under certain conditions at an annual rent of 12,000 tomans. ' Under these circumstances I have to instruct you to use your good offices with the view of obtaining from the Persian Government the restoration to the present Ruler of Maskat of the privilege granted to his father in 1855,' 132. On 23rd September Mr. Alison reported that the Shah would not consent to release Bandar Abbas to the Imam of Maskat and that Haji Ahmed Khan had been received lately at Shiraz with honour and reconfirmed.3 2 1 133. The Government of India wrote to Mr. Alison (No. 2848-P., dated 7th October 1871) 'With reference to your telegram of 23rd September reporting that His Majesty the Shah will not consent to release Bandar Abbas to the Sultan of Maskat, the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council desires me to express a hope that you will be able to fnduce the Persian Government at all events to allow the quest.on to remain an open one, and to abstain from giving any final decision at present. From the papers which I have the honour to enclose* Your Excelleny will perceive r r that since his accession to the Government of • From Colon Felly to Bombay Government, ]vi as i {a t, Saiyid Turki has on three occasions Nos. 305 -65, dated 25th March and No. 465-» i S- i solicited the good o^ces of the British Govern- dated 6th May 1871. w ith a view to obtain for him a release of Bandar Abbas. Considering the length of time during which the Maskat Government have been entrusted with the administration of this seaport, the friendly relations which it is desirable to see established between all the Governments possessing authority on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and the assistance which would be given to Saiyid Turki in consolidating his authority in Maskat if His Majesty the Shah were to entrust his confidence in the present Ruler by releasing Bandar Abbas on reasonable terras, considenng also how very desirable it is that the British Government should be enabled to strengthen its influence at Maskat by the successful exercise of its good offices in the matter, His Excellency in Council desires me to express the hope that you will continue your endea vours, as opportunity may offer, to bring about so desirable a result, or, at all events, to prevent the question being finally closed by a decision adverse to Saiyid Turki's hopes. His Excellency in Council is induced to urge this more strongly by the consideration that, on receipt of your telegram of 10th September, a communication was made through the Bombay Government enquiring whether Saiyid Turki would be prepared to send an Agent to Tehran to negotiate and conclude the lease, and to that communication a favourable answer has been received. Your Excellency will easily understand what embarrassments will arise if, after communications have been made which gave rise to a reasonable explanation of a favourable issue to the negotiation. His Excellency in Council is under the necessity of informing Saiyid Turki that the Persian Government decline to renew the lease.' 134. On 13th October 1871 Colonel Pelly (in No. 5778, from Bombay Government, 30th November) submitted in detail the views of His Highness the Sultan on the question of a release of the Bandar Abbas districts. He said:— ' The gist of His Highness' arguments seems to be that he would be very desirous of re-cessing the Bandar Abbas districts, provided he could do so on the terms accorded to the ex-Sultan Saiyid Salim ; provided, further, that the negotiation for the lease could be carried through without extravagant outlay at the Court of Persia ; and provided lastly, that, if practicable, the negotiation should be entirely in the hands of Colonel Pelly, or ''officer of similar rank, the Maskat Envoy being merely present for form's sake.' 135. Mr. Alison charged Mr. Dickson with a message to Sadr Azam, the Shah's Prime Minister, with the view of renewing the subject of the lease of Bandar Abbas, and reported (15th December 1871) that the Sadr Azam 's language was unfavourable, but (as requested in the despatch of the Govern ment of India, No. 2148-P. of 7th October 1871) he would not omit any good opportunity of bringing this matter before the Shah's Government. 136. To Mr. Dickson Sadr Azam said the he did not believe that the Shah meant strictly what his reply did literally convey. He entered into the early history of the question, recounting how previously an Agent of one of the Imams imprisoned a Persian Governor of Bandar Abbas for whose release Her Majesty's Government refused to intercede, and which was only obtained by a renewal of the lease. He said it would be humiliating to the Persian Government, who can perfectly maintain their country, to have to rent a posses sion to a family, who, after having professed their allegiance to Persia, cast upon it the grossest indignity. Persia, he added, would always value' EncrJand 's friendly advice and do her best to meet the wishes of Her Majesty's Govern ment and would protect British traders: any Agent of the Imam would not be officially recognized, though he would be treated with proper respect. cu ,A 113 ? 11 re Po rt ed on 18th December 1871 the appointment of Ahmed Shah of Mmab, to the Government of Bandar Abbas, in the room of Haii Ahmed Khan who had been dismissed.33 137- native agent at Lingah reported (enclosure in Bombay Govern ment letter No. 1084, dated 20th February 1872) of the intention to sell the landed property of Haji Ahmed Khan (his houses having been sold already), who was still in confinement and under a guard. XIV.—Saiyid Turki's desires ' V I) to place a Maskat Agent at Bandar Abbas and (11) to lease that port and its dependencies from Persia, 158. On the 30th January 1878 Colonel Miles reported ' The Wazir Saiyid Said, during a recent conversation with me, mentioned that From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of His Highness Saiyid Turki was anXlOUS to India, No. 82, dated 23td February 1879. have an agent residing at Bandar Abbas, and Political A., June 1879, Nos. 31-36. solicited my views and opinion on the subject.' ' Saiyid Said that the position of His Highness's subjects at Bandar Abbas, of whom there was a considerable number, engaged in trade and other occupations, was not alto gether satisfactory, as the treatment received by them at the hands of the Persian author ities and the protection afforded them in their dealings with others were not such as His Highness considered they ought to be, and it was thought the establishing an agent at that port would be beneficial to the interest of all Oman subjects in Southern Persia. I said that, if the Sultan desired it, I should be happy to communicate his wishes in the matter to you for the favour of your advice, and the Minister replied that His Highness would be much obliged by my doing so.' 139. Colonel Ross addressed Government on the subject as follows :— ' I understand that His Highness contemplates his proposed agent should have re cognized official status, as regards the Persian and other Governments, and it appears to'me this is not without difficulties and objections. There is nothing in Sayyid Turki's relations with British or any other Government to actually debar from direct diplomatic dealings with Persia, but, as a matter of fact, the rulers of Maskat have of late chosen to entrust their interests in Persia to the British Government. As a State in intimate friendly relations with our Government, and unrepresented in Persia, it has been the practice for the Resident in the Persian Galf to give good offices to Maskat subjects on the Persian coast. It appears to me that, as the Sultan would not be represented at the Court of Persia, his proposed Agent at Bandar Abbas would necessarily have to rely on the support of the British local representative, and His Highness would not be in any better ©position to protect the interests of his subjects than now. I am of opinion that any subjects of Maskat, who may reside or call at Bandar Abbas, are not exposed to any remarkable inconveniences, and are in fact as favourably treated as Brisish subjects. I think that Saiyid Turki's idea should be discouraged, but I would solicit the orders of His Excellency in Council before replying decidedly. It appears from a letter addressed by His Highness Saiyid Turki to the Residency Confidential News Agent that His Highness desires and hopes to obtain a lease of Bandar Abbas, but in my opinion there are insuperable obstacles in the way of that arrangement.' 140. On the 27th February Colonel Miles further reported :— 'His Highness Saiyid Turki has sent a telegram through his Wazir Saiyid Said _ to the Shah's Government at Tehran, soliciting From Resident Person Gul to Government h , ( Bandar Abbas on the same terms as of India, No. 101, dated 7th March i»/9. 1 1 j t-i 4. 1 the present lessee holds it. i he telegram was Political A., June 1879, Nos. 31-36. sen t to the Foreign Minister, and promised ' pushkesh ' if the request were acceded to.' 141. The views of Government were conveyed to the Resident by the follow ing letter — u i am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter Nos. 82 and 101, dated From Government of India, to Resident, Persian respectively 23rd February and 7th March 1879, Gulf, No. 1423 -E. t'., dated 19th May 1879. regarding — Political A., July 1879, Nos. 31-36. (1) the proposal of the Sultan of Maskat to establish an agency at Bandar Abbas ; {2) His Highness' desire to obtain a renewal of the lease by Persia to Maskat of the port of Bandar Abbas and its dependencies. ' With reference to the first point I am to say that Saiyid Turki may be informed that there is no objection on the part of the British Government to his sending an agent to Bandar Abbas in view to the protection of the interests of Maskat subjects at that port- The Governor-General in Council observes, however, that when His Majesty's legation in S640FD34 . r. u t Q„, to arrange for the lease of Bandar Abbas to Persia was endeavouring m Decern ^ 7 j o{ Maskat chose to send an agent to that Maskat, the Sadr Azam stated that it the he would no t be officially recognized* ( WT Dickson, Esq., to Her This declaration necessarily precludes the Gov- Maies^y's'Minister, Tehran, dated 15th December ernm ent of India from encouraging H ls Hlgh- 1871 ness' project of deputing an agent, ^d indeed j • tKp. &lt;;iihiect' and I am to desire that His makes it difficult to offer any . ad ' ce , U P 0 ' ' th at it may be explained to him Sfrssars ... u - - G0V The matter of the Snltan's wish to obtain renewal the Ieas=,of Bandar Abbas does Tot caH for any remarks at present from the Government of Indra. 142.

The following extract from a demi-official ,etter ./ 1 ® t ^ : ! 2nd ,864 in connection with the proposed telegraph treaty with Maskat puts e case clearly as to our title by prescription and acquiescence on the part of Persia. * — «... « Our title to a station on the Kwhm island is na v a \ and general station of old standing based on a •written permission given by the Imam » - . ii j Bassidore. 0i MX1-.ee G«i/paragraphs under our own flag.

In writing about the TelegraphH 1 Aitchinson's Treaties, Vol. xi. Treaty Colonel Pelly states : 11 Government will observe that Article VI relates to our station at Bassidore. Our title to that station has, of course, for many years been a bond, fide one. But on tele graphic and general considerations, the present seemed a convenient opportunity tor giving to our title the sanction of a written confirmatory deed.' 146. In 1863 a claim was made by the Persian authorites for the surrender of a slave, who was alleged to have escaped to Bassidore from her master, an inhabitant of Lingah with certain valuables belonging to the latter. The following opinion was expressed by Sir Arthur Lewis, the Advocate General, Bombay, on the question in his letter dated 10th March 1863. 'The right of one State to demand of another the delivery up of its own subjects, when guilty of crimes, is generally regulated by special treaty or compact, and is not a right^recognized by the law of nations. It is stated by jurists to be a right of imperfect See Wheaton on International Law, page 167, obligation. No special treaty or compact sixth edition, for the extradition of criminals exists between the British and Persian Government that I am aware of, and considering that the offence imputed to the slave is not a grave or serious crime, and one resting on mere assertion without any proof, I think that Political Resident determined rightly, and for the reasons stated by him, in refusing compliance in this case also with the demand for the slave s surrender. How far in other cases, where no treaty for extradition exists, and heinous crimes, such as murder, forgery, robbery, etc., may be alleged to have been committed by a fugitive slave, it would be expedient or proper to comply with a request for the35 delivery or sitrren der of the slave, must depend on the bona, fides of the demand, and on the proof in support of the charge which may accompany the demand for the slave s delivery or surrender- and on the other specialities of each such case. ^ In the two cases now submitted for my consideration, 1 entirely concur in the decision the Political Resident came to, in declining to interfere to effect the restoration of the slaves to their owners. 147. A demand for the surrender of certain slaves who had escaped to Bassidore was made in 1868 by the Persian authorities. The question was then fully discussed by Mr. Bayley, Advocate General, Bombay (letter dated 30th April 1868), about the British position at Bassidore, who wrote:— I am of opinion that the demand of the local Persian authorities for the surrender of the slaves mentioned in accompanying correspondence should not be complied with. 2. It may be interesting in an historical point of view, but is not perhaps absolutely essential for the purpose of^ answering the present reference, to consider the precise time, tr the mode in which, or from what power, the British obtained possession of Bassidore. 3. In the extracts from brief notes containing historical and other information connected with the island of Kishm and other islands and places in the Persian Gulf, prepared in 1818 by Captain Taylor, Assistant Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, printed in Vol. XXIV, new series, of the Bombay Government records, it is stated (pa^e 33) that ' the whole island of Kishm as well as a large portion of the opposite coast, in which are mines of brimstone, is farmed from Persia by the Imam of Maskat; and at page 37 it is stated « within the north-west of Kishm are the ruins of Bassidore, once a flourishing town under the Portuguese.' In a memoir published in the same volume, descriptive of the navigation of the Gulf of Persia, with brief notices of the commerce and resources of the people inhabit ing its shores and islands, prepared by the late Captain Brucks, Indian Navy, m 1835, it is stated (pacre 602) that ' Bassidore was once a flourishing Portuguese settlement, and the ruins ot the town are still in existence. In 1821 the force stationed in the Gulf for keeping down the pirate tribes was removed to this place from Sallack, and was withdrawn in 1823, since when it has been the head-quarters of the Indian naval squadron in the Gulf. They have a tolerable hospital and store-houses, and some houses occupied occasionally by the commanders of the vessels stationed there. There is a small bazaar and middling supplies. The place is the most healthy on the Island of Kishm, but far from being a desirable station;' and at page 605 of the same memoir, where the Island of Kishm is described, it is stated that, ' before the pirates became so powerful, it (the Island of Kishm) had about seventy small towns and villages, and a population of about twenty thousand inhabitants. A very great part of these were weavers, others cultivated the soil, and others were fishermen. Most of these were destroyed or obliged to seek shelter elsewhere during the time the pirates were in power; many are now return ing, but the island will never be what it is said to have been again. It belongs to the Imam of Maskat.'^ 4. In Aitchison's Collection of Treaties, Vol. VII (published in 1865), page 203, it is stated, &lt;( about the same time (z.£., 1845) he (His Highness Syad Saeed, Imam of Muscat) got into trouble with Persia regarding his possessions on the Mekran Coast Besides his possessions on the Arabian and African Coast, the Imam holds the islands of Hormuz and Kishm in the Persian Gulf, and is acknowledged as feudal lord by the Arabs on the Mekran Coast between ]ask and Passim. He holds Bunder Abbas and its dependencies on rent from Persia. In 1853 the Shah of Persia resumed possession of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, but he restored them to the Imam in 1856 on much less advantageous terms than formerly. The rent was raised from 6,000 to 16,000 tomans a year, and the islands of Hormuz and Kishm, the Imam's hereditary possessions, were ceded to Persia.'^ 5. From these extracts, the facts stated in which are, I presume, more or less correct, it would appear doubtful whether the British took possession of Bassidore whilst the Island of Kishm was subject to Persia, or whilst it belonged to the Imam of Maskat, and it is not impossible that Bassidore might have remained unoccupied after the once flourishing Portuguese settlement ceased to exist until the British took possession, 6. It does not, however, appear to me necessary, for the purposes of the present case, to consider which of these alternatives is the most probable, or whether any 10-mal instrument of gift or cession of Bassidore to the British was executed by the power to which the Island of Kishm then belonged. 7. This, I think, is borne out by the language of Dr. Lushington in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council on the 5th August 1863, in the important case of Papaganni versus the Russian Steam Navigation and trading Co., 2, Moore s Privy Ccuncil cases, new series, 181, an appeal from Her Majesty's Supreme Consular Court at Constanti nople—'* It must always be borne in mind that in almost all transactions, whether political36 or mercantile, a wide difference subsists in the dealings between an Oriental and a Christian State and tlie intercourse between two Christan nations. It is true beyond a 1 doubt that as a matter of right no State can claim jurisdiction of any kind within he territorial limits of another independent State. It is also true that between two Christian States all claims for iurisdiction of any kind, or exemption from jurisdiction, must be founded on treaty or engagements of similar validity. Such, indeed, were factory establish ments for the benefit of trade. ' But though according to the laws and usages of European nations a cession of jurisdiction to the subjects of one State within the territory of another would require gen erally at least the sanction of a treaty, it may by no means follow that the same strict forms, # the same provision of Treaty obligation, would be required or found in intercourse with the Ottoman Porte. ' It is true, as we have saidi that if you enquire into the existence of any particular privileges conceded to one State in the dominions of another, you would,^ amongst European nations, look to the subsisting treaties, but this mode of incurring obligation or of investigating what has been conceded is matter of custom and not of natural justice. ' Any mode of proof by which it is shown that a privilege is conceded is, according to the principle? of natural justice, sufficient for the purpose. The formality of a treaty is the best proof of the consent and acquiescence of parties, but it is not the only proof, nor does it exclude other proof, and more especially in transactions with Oriental States. ' Consent may be expressed in various ways, by constant usage permitted and acquiesced in by the authorities of the State, active assent or silent acquiescence where there must be full knowledge. ' This case is provided for by the Statute 6 and 7, Vict., c. 94. The first section of that Act recites that by treaty capitulations, grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means. Her Majesty hath power and jurisdiction within divers countries and places out of Her Majesty's dominions, and that doubts have arisen how far the exercise of such power and jurisdiction is controlled by, and depended upon, the laws of this realm, and enacts that Her Majesty may exercise any power or jurisdiction, which Her Majesty now hath or must at any time hereafter have within any country out of Her Majesty's do minions in the same, and as ample a manner as if Her Majesty had acquired such power or jurisdiction by the cession or conquest of territory. 8. I have ascertained by enquiring at the Political Department of the Secretariat, that we are at the present time in military occupation of Bassidore, and have been un interruptedly so for nearly half a country; and likewise that there is no extradition treaty with Persia. No trace of any such treaty is to be found in the collection of treaties and engagements above referred to, compiled for official use by Mr. Aitchison, B. C. S., when Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. g. It is now settled, as I have recently had occasion to point out in my opinion, No. 17, dated the 20th March 1868, respecting a question of extradition between the Governor of Damaun and this Government that the right of one State to demand of another the delivery up of its own subjects when guilty of crimes is generally regulated by special treaty or compact, and is not a right recognized by the law of nations, and is stated by jurists to be one of imperfect obligation.' 148. In 1868 a murder was committed in the naval station of Bassidore Political A., September 1868, Nos. 160-62. ^7 a man P a ^ ie&lt; ^ Said Sidi, and the ques tion was raised as to which Court should try the accused. The following opinion was expressed by the Advocate General, Bombay :— No, 1031, dated 29th June 1868. From — R. V. H earn, Esq., Solicitor to Government, Bombay, To—C. GONNE, Esq., Secretary to Government, Bombay. T have the honor to enclose a copy of the Opinion No. 35 of the Hon'ble the Advocate General upon the question submitted in the Government Reso lution No. 1566 of the 13th instant. 3. The enclosures of your above resolution herewith returned. No. 35, dated 27th Jane 1868. OPINION. It is stated by Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly that no official at Bassidore or in the Persian Gulf has authority to try a case of murder. Assuming that to be the case, and as I consider that the High Court of Bombay has no jurisdiction to try the accused Saeed, it appears to me that the best course to be adopted by Government will be to deport the accused from bassielore.37 2 That the High Court at Bombay lias no jurisdiction is, I think, clear from the statutes and letters patent, and from the decision of the Privy Council in 1357 in the case of Uga Hoongthe Queen, Vll, Moore's Indian Appeals, 72, which was an appeal from a judgment on a conviction of tht Supreme Court at Calcutta by a majority of the Judges (Sir Charles Jackson dissentiente) in a case of murder committed within the limits of the Charter of the East India Conipanyon an island called Wah Gyoon in the Bay of Bengal. 3. It was held by the Privy Council that the Supreme Court at Calcutta had no juris diction under the 9, Geo. IV., c, 74, s. 56, to try an indictment for murder committed and wholly completed at a place within the trading limits of the East India Company's Charter by native subjects of Burma under the Government of the East India Company representing the Crown, who would not, under former statutes regulating the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, have been amenable to its criminal jurisdiction. The Privy Council therefore decided that the judgment could not be supported, and tiiat the conviction was wrong, and expressed a clear opinion that statutes giving criminal jurisdiction were to be construed strictly. 4. The accused Saeed, not being a British subject, could not, in my opinion, have been tried in the late Supreme Court at Bombay for a crime committed by him on land beyond the local jurisdiction of that Court, nor can he be tried for such an offence in the High Court. In the case of Rex versus Francisco Jose, Morton ) s Rep.^ 218, the Supreme Court at Calcutta held that a foreigner who had committed an offence beyond the province of Bengal was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under the statute 26, Geo. HI., c. 57, sec. 29, although, if the offence had been committed by a native subject in the town of Calcutta, the Court would have had jurisdiction—Jannokee Doss versus the King I,, Moore's Indian Appeals, 67. 5. As it might, perhaps, be contended that the case came within the Foreign Jurisdic tion Act, 1843 (5 and 7 Vic., c. 94), I requested that a search might be instituted at the Secretariat whether any order had been made by the Queen in Council under that Act, or under the Foreign Jurisdictional Amendment Act of 1866 (29 and 30 Vic., c. 87), appointing Bombay or any other place as the place to which persons committing crimes or offences at Bassidore were to be sent for trial ; but the search which has been made has been unsuccessful. 6. A search has likewise been instituted at the Secretariat with the view of seeing if a native has ever been sent from Bassidore to Bombay for trial for an offence committed at Bassidore, but such search has also proved unsuccessful. 7. I have also enquired at the office of the Clerk of the Crown with the like object, but have been informed by the Head Clerk, who speaks from a personal knowledge of the last 22 vears, that no such case has occurred during his time, nor, so far as he has ever heard, in that of any of his predecessors. 8. The present case does not appear to me to come within the provisions of Act I of 1849, an Act to provide more effectually for the punishment of offences committed in Foreign States, as section 2 of that Act does not include such a person as the accused ' Saeed,' g. Under the circumstances, therefore, of the present case, there being no tribunal before which the accused can be brought for trial, and as it is contrary to the spirit of the English Criminal Jurisprudence to incarcerate a person for an indefinite period without bringing him to trial, 1 see no other course open, but to remove him from Bassidore to such other place as may be most convenient (the mainland would probably be preferable to anywhere on the island), and there give him his liberty. (Sd.) LYTTLETON H. BAYLEY, Advocate General. 149. The Bombay Government therefore observed as follows in their Reso lution No. 1857, d at:e ^ July 1868 :— RESOLUTION.—It is not satisfactory that there should be no means of bringing to justice a man who,, by his own confession has committed a murder in a place which for the last half century has been virtually, if not actually, British territory. The Advocate General seems to intimate that, if the accused were a British subject, he could be proceeded against in any competent Court within the Bombay Presidency under Act I of 1849. It is not clear why the Advocate General has assumed that he is not a British subject. He is spoken of in the evidence as having lately come from Bombay. Further enquiry should be made on this point, the Advocate General being first asked to state whether, in the event of the accused proving to be a British subject, he would recommend his being sent to Bombay to be proceeded against under Act I of 1849. This case suggests the necessity of steps being at once taken to create the jurisdic tions necessary for the cognizance of offences committed at the British station, Bassidore. Colonel Pelly writes ' No official in these regions has authority to try a case of murder.' S640FD38 He should be asked whether any jurisdictions have been seated for ^'wfth? He minor offiences, and if not, how has the crime committed at Bassidore been dealt with ? He should also be asked to state the size of the population residing witUn the limits of the station. The Advocate General should, on this information being received, be requested to advise on the general question. Thereupon the Advocate General expressd the following opinion No. 39, dated 22nd July 1868. OPINION. 1. Assumed that the accused was not a British subject, (i) because it nowhere appeared in the proceedings that he was one ; and (2) because the evidence shovyed that the . accused and the deceased both came to Bassidore together from Minnow about three years ago (see deposition of Jaffer Seedce), a statement which was endorsed by Captain Way, 1st Assistant Political Resident, who says, in his letter to C olonel Pelly, that Saeed (the accused) and the deceased came together to Bassidore about three years ago. A innow is a town on the Persian mainland, some 15 miles from the sea. 2. In the event of the accused proving to be a British subject, I would not recommend his being sent to Bomhay to be proceeded against under Act I of 1849. I never intended to intimate (though my language might certainly be considered to bear that construction) that if he were a British subject, he could be prosecuted in any Court in this Presidency. 3. Act I of 1849 provides for the punishment of offiences committed in Foreign States, and section 2 enacts that the persons therein specified shall be amenable to the law for all offences committed by them within the territory of any foreign Prince or State. 4. Bearing in mind the fact already point out in paragraph 3 0 f m y foimer Opinion that, in the judgment of the Privy Council, statutes giving criminal jurisdiction must be construed strictly, and that Great Britain has been xn uninterrupted possession of Bassidore for a considerable number of years, I think that no Magistrate in Bombay ought to commit such a case as the present for trial, and that no Judge presiding at the Criminal Sessions would tell the Jury that an offence committed at Bassidore was one which could really be said to be committed within the territory of any foreign Prince or State, Indeed I think I should feel bound, in opening such a case to the Jury, to tell them that I could not hope for a conviction, and that I must consent to a verdict of not guilty, on the ground that the High Court had no jurisdiction to try such a case. • (Sd.) L. H. Bayley, Advocate General. 1^0. The point was referred to the Government of India, and on the opinion expressed by Lord Lytton and Sir Henery Maine, they replied to the Bombay Government in letter No. 998, dated 8th September 1868 No. 998,dated Sih September 1868. From— W. S. Seton-Karr, Esq., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To—C. G onne, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 9th ultimo, No. 177, forwarding a copy of certain papers relative to the commission of a murder at the station of Bassidore on the island of Kishm in the Persian Gulf, and enquiring whether the Government of India consider Bassidore to be British territory, 2. In reply I am directed to convey to you the opinion of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General in Council that the station in question cannot properly he considered as British territory. It is perfectly true that we have occupied Bassidore either as a naval or coaling station tor nearly half a century. But the island has been always treated^ by us as a dependency of Bunder Abbas, and Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, including this island of Kishm, and, consequently, Bassidore, have been leased to the Sultan of Muscat by the Shah of Persia under circumstances with which the Government of Bombay is perfectly familiar. It is unnecessary to say more on this head than to refer to the renewal of the lease which has just been negotiated by Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly and to Aitehison s Treaties, Vol. VII, page 204. 3. It follows in such circumstances that the lessee can have no greater rights, nor be in a better position than his lessor, and as the British Government holds possession of the town of Bassidore by permission of the Sultan of Muscat, while that potentate derives his lease of Kishm, which includes Bassidore, from the Shah of Persia, it follows necessarily that Kishm must still be considered as Persian territory. There may be some obscurity as to the exact nature of our derivative title to the town of Bassidore, and it may have been thought that our rights over the town existed by continued usage, or that we had obtained a prescriptive title; hut in looking closely into the question, it becomes evident that our rights are subordinate to those 0/ Muscat, which again are admittedly, entirely subordi nate to those of Persia, and have been always so treated up to this very hour.39 4. This being the real position of a ffairs in the opinion of the Government of India, it is now necessary to see what course ought to be followed in the case of murder which has given rise to this reference, and in simillar cases of heinous crimes in future. 5. Looking to the opinion of the learned Advocate General of Bombay, His Excellency in Council thinks it hopeless to expect that the ends of justice would be attained by any attempt to send the accused for trial to the High Court of that Presidency. His Excellency in Council concurs in the opinion that the criminal in this instance is not amenable to the local jurisdiction of that tribunal, and though he does not hold, as the learned Advocate appears to do, that Bassidore must, on any criminal trial, practically be treated as British and not as foreign territory, the difficulties in the way of obtaining a convention are so clearly pointed out in Mr. Bayley's opinion, that under no circumstances ought any person accused, in this or simdar cases, to be referred for a regular trial by that High Court. 6. But the Government of India cannot consent to the alternative proposed, namely, that the accused should be deported to the mainland and there set at liberty. 7. The course which ought to be pursued in this and other similar cases is, in the opinion of His Excellency in Council, as follows :—The crime should be trated as one com mitted in a foreign territory, in which the British Government has a representative for political purposes, and where there is no proper tribunal to take cognizance of such cases and to bring offenders to justice. It is said by Colonel Pelly that there is no official in these regions who has authority to try a case of murder, and it is not even clear from the correspondence, especially from the Resolution of the Bombay Government dated the 17th of July last, No 1857, whether any one has jurisdiction ^ e co g n i zance minor offences. 8. If this be the case, some official at Bassidore should be at once empowered to hear and decide petty criminal cases, as well as to hold sessions for the trial of persons accused of the heinous crimes of murder, robbery, and the like, and to refer the proceedings on such trials, for confirmation, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The official holding the trial at Bassiaore would, in the eye of the law, be thus merely using the delegated authority of Persia and Maskat. The Political Resident should be empowered to pass sentences in all referred trials within the limits assigned to Sessions Judges in the Bombay territory, and in all cases in which a capital sentence is deemed necessary, the proceed ings should be referred by the Resident, for confirmation or otherwise, to the Government of Bombay. 9. This is the system which has been adopted on this side of India in the cases of crimes committed in Rajputana, Indore, and other Native States, where a high official resides and exercises political and judicial authority. Such cases are there tried by the representative of the British Government, using the delegated authority of the Native ruler, and the sentences are referred eventually for confirmation to the Government of India, in the Foreign Department. Copies of proceedings in two trials so held are forward ed for the information of the Government of Bombay. 10. His Excellency in Council is aware of no reason why this form of procedure should not be successfully followed in the case of Bassidore : and, subject to any opinion of suggestion which the Bombay Government may wish to offer on the matter, he thinks measures should be immediately taken to provide for the administration of justice and the punishment of crime in this case and all others in the mode above indicated, and thus to put an end to a state of things so obviously derogatory to the credit of the British Government. 151. The following letter of Colonel Ross at Bassidore contain an interesting review of our position at Bassidore:— In your office No. 2282-P., dated 2nd October 1877, a report is called for showing the grounds for the opinion expressed by Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux in his letter No. 183, dated igth July 1877, that the station of Bassidore has always been regarded in the Persian Gulf as a British dependency, I have now the honour to comply to the best of my power with this instruction. 2. 1 presume it is desired that the report should include all available information to enable Government to judge, not only as to the light in which Bassidore has been habi tually regarded as concerns our tenure of it by the Political Officers and others in the Persian Gulf but also as to the validity or otherwise of the grounds for the position so assumed. 3. In this view it might be convenient to consider the following three points separately ;— (1) Our actual position at Bassidore adhering to the simple facts of the case apart from questions of jurisdiction or rights of possession, &amp;c. (2) The nature of'the tenure as habitually regarded by British authorities, and others, as shown by correspondence on record, and by the exercise of certain assumed rights and prerogatives. (3) The nature and validity or otherwise of the title under which we occupy Bassidore, and whether under the circumstances a right of possession has been established.4° 4. As regards the first point, it will be seen that in the Administration Reports of the Persian Gulf for the past four years Bassidore (or Basiduh) is described as a British station, and in the occupation of the British Government, and is reported on distinctly from Persian and Arab ports or territories. B or some time purely a naval station, at the present time a guard uf a native regiment is quartered at Bassidore,.as much perhaps for the sake of marking our position as for protective purposes. We are thus, or so far, in military occupation of the place. _ We have buildings the property of ^e British Gov ernment; likewise a good stone pier, water tanks, and a coal depot. The Bn ish flag, i.e., the plain Union Jack, is constantly flown, not, as at bushire and Maskat, to maik the presence of a Political representative of the British Government, but distinctly as a sign of our occupation of the place. These are, I think, the facts necessary to denote our position at Bassidore as patent and open to any passer-by to mark. ■v As regards the second head noted for consideration, to enable Government to judge fully as to the position hitherto assumed A.—Extract from a letter from the Governor of , British authority regarding Bassidore, I Bombay, to Pnnce Regent of Fars, dated 30th ^ J ii„ October 1822. hnd it necessary to quote the marginally noted , ■ cr * 1 1 *£ * „ correspondence extending over a number of B.-Extract from a demi-official letter from 1 , . , ? ^ r . f Colonel Pelly, to His Excellency Mr. Alison, years, and I append copies to iacihtate refer- dated 2Jind October 1864. ence. 6. I thinka perusal of these papers will Kovembei 1864. suffice to show that the Political omcers ot from Government of Bomb,y. to Government habitually considered Bassidore as Colonel Pelly, No. 957, dated 27th March 1863, British soil, and acted, as occasion required, on and accompaniment. that assumption with the approval of Govern- E.-Resolution of Bombay Government.

It is certain also that our Arab 1868, paragraphs s, 6, and 7. Persian neighbours have habitually looked G.—Letter from Government of India, to Gov- on Bassidore as a British possession. I sub- ^^^F^gn KOtem ' then that Colonel Prideaux was warranted in the statement he madej to the effect that Bassidore has always been regarded in the Persian Gulf as a British dependency. 7. Presuming that it is sufficiently shown that British authorities have assumed Bassidore to be British soil, and habitually acted on that assumption, we come to the third head of enquiry, namely, our title to possession. It appears that our occupation of Bassidore dates from the year 1820, when the then Sultan of Maskat verbally made the port over to the British. This cession was confirmed in 1864 by the Sultanas son and successor, as will be seen by reference to the Convention No. XL1I, Articled, at pages 105 and sob of Vol. VII of Aitchison^s Treaties (Edition of 1876). These grants, and such prescriptive right as our undisturbed occupation of nearly sixty years may be held to confer, constitute our title to possession. 8. On the other hand possibly the Persian Government might, if the question were raised, dispute the right of a Sultan of Maskat to dispose of Bassidore, on the score that his tenure of the island of Kishm at the time did not convey to him sovereign rights. From enclosure A I infer that in 1822 Persian authorities did prefer some claim. I think in this connection it might be fairly urged that the Persian Government have been fully aware all those years of our assumption of the prerogatives of possession at Bassidore and have by silence acquiesced. g. There is the further question of the expediency or convenience of the occupation of Bassidore, on which I may be permitted to remark. 10. As matters now stand and with no Residency steamer in the Persian Gulf, Bassidore is little use to us, and I think it would be mainly on the ground of its being a place under our flag that its continued maintenance should be supported. 11. Other places* could be found equally, indeed more, convenient for coaling stations, and if it were a question to abandon ♦ For instance, Kenjam Island, where we have our c l a i ms to possession of Bassidore, it would a telegraph station. . . r 1 • • n . be in my respectful opinion equally a question as to whether we should not abandon the station altogether. Indeed, if we were in future to consider and deal with it as Persian territory, it would be perhaps the only mode of procedure open. 12. Holding the opinion that we have acquired sufficient right to treat Bassidore as British territory, I naturally consider that we should hold it as such, unless or until we could acquire an equivalent more suitable to our requirements under our flag.4i XXI.—Telegraph station at Angaum (Henjam).* 1*2.

Both Colonel Goldsmid and Colonel Felly agreed in the desirability of transferring the telegraph station from Cape Musandim to Angaum. The only obstacles to the immediate occupation of Angaum were political, ansin out of the rival claims of Persia and Maskat to the island as a dependency ot Kishm (Bassidore) which is included in the farm of Bandar Abbas. 1*4 Colonel Goldsmid abstained from discussing the political aspect of the 54 ' u Q P u p Question (which Colonel Pelly regarded as ...tog' 4 ' 0 ' &lt;1UOted m ^ favouring the claims of M askat), but stated that in a general proposal which he was about to submit for future telegraphic arrangements with Persia, the territory of Bandar Abbas, including Kishm and its dependencies, would be treated, as actually found, viz.. under the flag of that 1 ec The proposal was then recommended to the Government of Indiat 55- r an( j Ma esty s Secretary of State, t L p'g' 2 N 6 0 5 'Hot'D e h pt t T^»t P E'el Tel.P,o- it being observed with respect to the ceedings. political aspect of the question that there appeared to be no doubt that Persia was the only Power which could object to the transfer of the Musandim station to Angaum ; but that there seemed t no reason to suppose that Persia would refuse consent to the transfer if it be properly proposed to the Persian Government.

In their letter No. 1 133 of the 16th November 1867, the Government of . „ , vt o India enquired of the Bombay Government Proceedings, Political A, November 1867, No. 28. whetheI . by the terms of the conven tio n concluded between Maskat and Persia in 1856 and by the interpretation which, according to Colonel Pelly's reports, had been practically given to those terms, the former power retained any sufficient interest in the island, or in the occupation of it as to render it expedient to make to the Sultan of Maskat the reference suggested by the Secretary of State in his Despatch No. 17, dated the 14th September 1867, to the Bombay Government. The Government of India also pointed out that in their opinion the former rights of Maskat in Bandar Abbas and the territories dependent on that port having been merged in Persia, any application to Maskat for permission to settle in Angaum might possibly be understood by the Sultan as a constructive recognition from the British Govern ment of rights claimed by him which apparently had ceased to exist. They further asked to be informed of the result of the negotiations authorized by the Government of India to be instituted by the Bombay Government with the Shah's Government through the mediation of Mr. Alison for securing Angaum. 164. In reply the Bombay Government said in their letter No. 283 of the 31st 0 .. D 1A , qao m December 1867, that the Island of Anoraum Proceedings, Political A, January 1868, No. 134. , . . &lt;• , • , • as forming part of the territory attaching to Bandar Abbas could not be regarded otherwise than as a Persian possession. The lease from the Persian Government through which the administration of this territory remained for some time in the hands of the Sultan of Maskat expired on the death of the late Sultan Thovveyni. The Persian Government had declined to renew the lease with the new Sultan, whose only present connec tion with Bandar Abbas consisted in the fact that the person in whose favour the lease had been renewed was Sheikh Said, who was the Governor of Bandar Abbas, under the late Sultan and who till then owned allegiance to Maskat. The letter concluded with the remark that in the opinion of His Excellency in Council the Sheikh, and not the Sultan, was the person to whom the application for permission to settle in Angaum should be made. 165.

Your Excellency disapproves of our opening the question with Persia, and Colonel Pelly says that no cession can be made by the present lessee of Bandar Abbas.

I am awaiting further instructions before communicating with the Sheikh.' 169. With their memorandum No. 241-B., dated the 10th March 1868, the Government of India forwarded a copy of their letter No. 241-A. of the same date to the British Minister in Persia. Extracts from the letter are as follows:— ' It has, the Governor-General in Council observes, been explained to the Shah's Govern ment that the proposed arrangement consists merely in the transfer of a telegraphic station from one point to another in the jurisdiction of the Imam of Maskat with his consent. Your Excellency is persuaded that on the nature of the change being made clear to the Shah, His Majesty's consent will be readily given. 1.?.. the information given in Bombay Govern- p rom marginally noted information sub- ment letter No. 283, dated the 31st December I807. , ,1^1 .r r- mitted by the Bombay Government the Gov ernor-General in Council is however inclined to apprehend that the Persian Government may ere this have taken exception to the description of the Island of Angaum as a point within the jurisdiction of the Imam of Maskat. But the Governor-General in Council sees grounds for hoping that the present opportunity may be successfully taken for pressing upon the attention of the Persian Government the proposal in the form which it originally, took, namely, the concentration at the Island of Angaum of all our establishments at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. This measure would involve the removal to that place of the telegraphic station now fixed at Musandim and of the naval station at Bassidore in which the territorial rights of the Persian Government would appear to be exactly similar to those in Angaum. It might be easy to arrange with Persia, so that the prescriptive right by which a partial tenure is enjoyed at Bassidore should be transferred to Angaum. I am to request that His Majesty the Shah may be moved to give the requisite permission.' 170. By his letter, dated the 30th March 1868, Sir C.

Full papers will be sent by mail if they have not already been forwarded.' 175. On the 29th July 1868 the following telegram was sent by the Bombay Proceedings No. 32 in Political A., August 1868, Government to the Government of India ' Nos. 23 .36. ' His Excellency has received the following telegram from Colonel Pelly :— 1 Prince Gov ernor has requested me to postpone my departure from Shiraz in view to completing Settle ment of Bandar Abbas question.

The Imam does not claim sovereignty, but that the territory (Bandar Abbas) should be're-leased to him, inasmuch as he claims that the former lease was wrongfully pat an end to. As regards Angaum, the case is different, as Colonel Pelly says that, upon investigation, it has always been Maskat territory, and is included neither in the lease of 1855 nor in the map thereto annexed and now exhibited by the Persians themselves. His Excel lency is unaware what the terms of the convention negotiated by Mr. Alison are, or the grounds on which His Excellency the Viceroy still considers Angaum a dependency of Bunder Abbass, and therefore requests that he may be enabled to give the instructions required by Colonel Pelly.

The following telegram was re- Proceedings No. 105 in Political A., October 1868, • 1 / n • 1 • 1 ir Nos. 104-109. ceived trom the Resident in the Gulf on the 6th August 1868 :— ' My opinion is that from the first Angaum, like Larack and other islands in the south of the Gulf, had no connection with the Bandar Abbas Local Government. It formed one of four islands, the property of the Maskat Sultan, and when Persia forced the Sultan ^ x to accept Bandar Abbas in case she specified two islands, viz.^ Ormuz and Kishm, as being included in such lease. But Larack and Angaum were not named and have not, to my knowledge, been called in question. Larack people acknowledge Maskat Sultan ; and on Angaum have long resided some of the Sultan's Arab tribe of Soudan. There is no Persian on the island. The Maskat Minister and others declare that Angaum has belonged to Maskat ever since the foundation of the present ruling dynasty. The Minister having heard some rumours of Persian interference in relation to our telegraphic works, immediate ly ordered reinforcements there. They were stayed only at my request. Maskat will never give up Angaum or Larack to Persia unless under order of compulsion from British India. She considers it essential to their (? her) stakes at the south of the Gulf that these islands should continue hers or become ours. I have studied the Angaum question since 1 first brought it under the notice of Government nearly six years ago, and my respectful final opinion is that Angaum belongs to Maskat, that it was not alluded to in the Bandar45 Abbas lease, that it is not alluded to in the lease now signed the day before yesterday, and that the events of the next ten or niteen Copy was forwarded to the Government of India . jj } h t cons ideration of trade with letter No. 199, dated 17th September 186a. w ui ouw , .. .. • . , ^ Proceedings No 104 in Political A., October intercommunication and policy all point to our 1868, Nos. 104-109. upholding Maskat in her possession, not only of Angaum, but of Gwadur and her other territories on the Mekran Coast.' 177. In their letter No. 790, dated 21st July 1868, to the Bombay Govern ment, the Government of India made the following observations : ' In my letter No. 634, dated 19th June, you were informed that His Excellency in Council could not approve of intervention on Proceedings No. 24 in Political A„ August conditions which do not recognize the sovereign 1868, Nos. 22-36. rights of Persia over the territories embraced in the engagement of 1855. These territories include not only Bandar Abbas. Kishm, Hormuz, etc., but also all their dependencies. In your letter No. 283, dated the 31st December 1867, the Bombay Government reported that the Island of Angaum as forming part of the territory attaching to Bandar Abbas cannot be regarded otherwise than as a Persian possession. Indeed, throughout the whole correspondence the sovereign rights of Persia over Angaum have never been questioned, and the course of our negotiations has culminated in our asking for and obtaining the consent of the Shah to the establishment of a telegraph station there. 'Under these circumstances, and presuming that Colonel Pelly was in possession of the instructions of 19th June previous to his arrival at Shiraz, His Excellency in Council fails to understand how Colonel Pelly could reconcile it with his duty to permit the rights of Persia over Angaum to be questioned.' • Proceedings No. 33 in Political A., Augest I 78. The following telegram* Was deS- 1868, Nos. 32-36. patched to the Bombay Government by the Government of India on the 30th July 1868:— 'The Governor-General assumes that the convention between Persia and Maskat re ported by Colonel Pelly disposes of the whole question regarding Bandar Abbas, including Angaum. If not, the Governor-General can say nothing further until any doubts in respect to Angaum be cleared up, and with this object the Governor -General is ready to hear all which can be urged in favour of Maskat claims. The Governor-General has no wish to consider that the island belongs to Persia, unless it has hitherto^ been treated as Persian territory, but, so far as the records in this office afford information, such would seem to be the case, and it was distinctly stated to be a Persian possession in_ the Bombay letter of qist December last, replying to questions of Government of India. The Government of India cannot empower Colonel Pelly to treat in favour of Maskat with Persia until this point is settled, if further intervention is necessary or if anything has arisen to place the claims of Maskat in a new light.' No. 104 in Political A., October 1868, Nos. 104- 1 19' In ^Uer No. 199 of the I 7th 109. September 1868 the Government of Bombay observed as follows :— 'The Government of India do not seem to be justified in assuming that^ the conven tion recently reported by Colonel Pell) 1 ' to have been concluded between Persia and Maskat disposes of the whole question regarding Bandar Abbas, including Angaum It disposes of the lease of Bandar Abbas, but makes no mention of Angaum. The ^oubt still remains whether the island is included in the lease, in like manner as a similar doubt has been expiessed in regard to the convention of 1855. ' It no doubt was stated in the letter of this Government, No. 283 of the 31st Decem ber last, that the island of Angaum, as forming part of Bandar Abbas, cannot be con sidered otherwise than as a Persian possession. But at an earlier date, in their letter of 16th November 1867, No. 1133, to which the above letter of the Bombay Government was a reply, the Government of India had assumed, as a matter beyond dispute, that Angaum was a dependency of Bandar Abbas. Indeed, this Government had proposed on the suggestion of Mr. Alison to treat with Maskat in reference to Angaum until the receipt of the despatch from the Government of India of the 16th November 1867. 14 It mav be conceded that the geographical position of Angaum would appear to iustify the opinion that it is a dependency of Bandar Abbas ; its size as compared with the island it adjoins would appear to lead to the inference that it would be included without special mention in the lease under the title of Bandar Abbas, Kishm and their e- pendencies. ' But since the date when these view were expressed by the Government of Bombay and the Government of India, Colonel Pelly has reported that in the course of the pro- ceedines relative to the Bandar Abbas lease it had been made apparent to him that the title of Persia to Angaum was not and never had been admitted by the Government of Maskat. The island is certainly not included by name in the lease ot 1855, and 15 not m the map of Bandar Abbas territories. S640F D46 'The Government of India has further expressed Its inability to understand how Colonel Pellv could consider it consistent with his duty to permit the sovereign rights ot Persia to be questioned, but considering that the instructions given to him were evidently framed in ignorance that the island was claimed by Maskat, and that the sovereign rights of Persia were not admitted by that State, it occurs to the Governor in Council that it was impossible for Colonel Pelly to avoid bringing that fact to the notice of this Government with the view to its being communicated to the Government of India. Had he failed to do so, and the right of Maskat had been afterwards asserted, the Government of India would justly have visited Colonel Pelly with its displeasure for withholding from them a fact in ignorance of which they had been a party to depriving one State of its lawful territory and handing it over to another. ' The information furnished by Colonel Pelly on the subject is mentioned in his telegram dated the 6th August 1868 (copy attached). 'His Excellency in Council requests that the Government of India will be good enough to communicate to him the information referred to as existing in the Foreign Office, that Angaum has always hithereto been treated as Persian territory. He would be glad to be favoured with a copy of the convention with Persia, if it has been received, regarding Angaum, as steps are now being taken by this Government for the erection of buildings on the &amp; island, and His Excellency in Council is not aware what restrictions or limitations, if any, may exist in this respect.' 180. Reference is then invited to letter from the Resident in the Gulf, No. 103, dated the 31st August 1868, the concluding portion of which is as follows :— ' Mr. Alison appears to consider that the tone of Maskat on the present occasion has been ' lofty'. But perhaps it was scarcely to be expected that an independent State like that of Maskat could see her dependency of Bandar Abbas suddenly surprised by a Persian force and her Governor unceremoniously expelled, without some feelings of irritation; and I entertain myself no doubt whatever that had it not been for British intervention there would have been a formidable descent of Arabs on the Persian coast, I believe Lingah and the islands were the first points destined for attack. ' As matters have turned out, the Bandar Abbas lease has been amicably settled, the question of Angaum was not introduced into the discussion, and the Persian Coast has been preserved from insult.' {N.B. —The rest of this letter is a repetition of his telegram of the 6th August 1868— vide paragraph 176 supra.) 181.

In reply, the Government of India said, in their letter No. 1294, dated d ' m the 3rd November 1868, that the Gover- Proceedmgs No. 86, ibid. £ . . „ m i i if nor-General in Council had approved of the directions given by the Bombay Government in regard to the occupation of Angaum, and remarked as follows ' It is strictly correct that Angaum is not mentioned in Mr. Alison's letter of 2nd April 1868, nor, by name, in the convention to which the despatch gave cover. But it is, on the other hand, perfectly certain that the despatch of the Secretary of State to the Governor of Bombay in Council of the 7th May last, which gave cover to a memorandum of Lieuten ant-Colonel Goldsmid, and to a copy of the same convention as was forwarded by Mr. Alison, expressly mentioned Angaum as a place of which Persia had permitted the occupa tion, while throughout all that correspondence it is evident that Angaum is alluded to as the subject of discussion between the two Governments, and as the place to which it was desirable to shift the cable as soon as permission could be obtained from Persia. The telegram from Lord Stanley to Sir Stafford Northcote of 19th August 1867, and other telegrams quoted in the same despatch from the India House, specially mention Angaum ; and the Secretary of State in his telegram of the 20th February last to Mr. Alison desired that ' Coasts and places * specified in the convention should be understood to comprise dependencies or islands, so that there may be no difficulty regarding Angaum if required as a telegraph station. Similarly in his despatch of the 2nd April 1868, Mr. Alison distinct'y terms the document forwarded by him a convention signed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the convention is described as concluded between Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the King of all the Kingdoms of Persia. On referring to the letter of Mr. Alison, dated the 31st March, which is to the address of Lord Stanley, His Excellency in Council finds that Mr Alison distinctly terms the communication one from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, conveying the Shah's sanction for the erection according to the enclosed rough sketch and return of employes furnished by Major Champain, of a telegraph station on the Island of® Angaum. His Excel lency in Council mu^t consequently presume that His Majesty's Minister at Tehran had good reason for concluding that the Persian Minister was authorised to use the name and to give the sanction of the Shah to the project/' * See page 49 of Volume 6 of 1868.48 ,SS.

Anglo-Persian War of 1856-57. The British Expedition into the Persian Gulf, 1856-57. XXII.—Causes of the Anglo-Persian War, 1856-57. 186. In the Precis on Persian Gulf Affairs (1800-1853) we dealt with our relations with the Persian Shahs of Bajaur dynasty; Fath Ali Shah (1798-1834) and his grandson Mahomed Shah (1834-1848). During the first years of Fath Ali Shah's reign we flattered the vanity of the Persian monarch by magnificient embassies and costly presents, with a view to keep Persia under our influence and to prevent its falling under the influence of the French. When the French scare passed away, Persia almost entirely disappeared from the British Imperial diplomacy, and the diplomatic relationship with that country was relegated to the control of the Government of India, the result of which was that Russia got gradually an upperhand in the Councils of Persia, which it still retains. On the death of Fath Ali Shah in 1834 and the accession of his grand son Mahomed Shah, the Home Government resumed the control of our diploma tic relations with Persia, but to find that the British ministers had a difficult game to play with a Prince having ambitious projects for conquests especially in the east, much under Russian influence and actuated by a strong anti-British spirit. We have seen how Mahomed Shah's ambition displayed itself in his invasion of Afghanistan and siege of Herat held by Prince Kamranand his power ful minister, Yar Mahomed. The siege of Herat was raised on the British occu pation of the Karrak island, and the Anglo-Persian difficulties having been amicably settled, the British force was withdrawn from Karrak in March 1842. 187. Mahomed Shah died in 1848 and was succeded by his son Nasir-ud-din, who had inherited his ambitious dream of conquering Afghanistan. Yar Mahomed had killed his chief Karman and made himself the lord of the Herat kingdom, maintaining his position by acknowledging himself a vassal of the Persian king. On his death in 1851, his son, Seyyid Mahomed Khan, succeeded him. His power was threatened by Dost xVlahomed. Amir of Kabul, and his brother Kohandil, chief of Kandahar, while the Herat Chieftains made his position insecure at home by constant opposition and intrigue. The Persian court saw now its opportunity, and readily availed itself of beyyid Mahomed's appeal for help, to send an expedition under the command of Murad Mirza, Governor of Khorasan, nominally to repel an advance of the chief of Kandahar, but in the course of the operations, Herat was occupied by Persian troops. Upon this Colonel Sheil remonstrated with such powerful eftect that the Persian Government thought Aitchison 's Treaties, Volume x, Peisia, No. it fit to enter into an engagement with the XVIIL British Government (25th January 1853) not to send troops into Herat territory unless it should be attacked by a foreign force and even in such a case not to occupy the fort,of Herat and not to interfere in Herat affairs more than had been done during the lifetime of Yar Mahomed.

In 1855 the power of Seyyld Mahomed Khan was overthrown by a Sadoze Prince, Mahomed Yusuf, whose usurpation was acquiesced in by the Persian Government. In autumn 1855 Mahomed Yusuf applied to them for aid against Dost Mahomed, who had annexed Kandahar to his dominions on the death of his brother Kohandil Khan, and who was now reported to have threatened Herat. Prince Murad Mirza was thereupon despatched with a large force to Herat. The place was captured in October 1856 after a siege of six months. 188A. Meanwhile the position of the British Envoy had been made intoler able by systematic insults and annoyances, in the art of which the Persians are adepts. And as for a gross instance of malicious insult to our Envoy, no redress could be obtained. Mr. Murray found it necessary to break off diplomatic relations and retire to Baghdad in December 1855. XXIII.—The Expedition to the Gulf and the Karun River, 1856-57. 189. While matters were progressing so unfavourably in Persia, the British Government decided to repeat the tactics of 1838-40 by sending an expedition into the Persian Gulf, only on a large scale with a view even to proceed up the Karun and also capture Ispahan and Shiraz. The British operations which are detailed in Major Bell's* Account of British wars in Persia^ are breiefly sum marized below:— 26th October 1856. —Herat surrendered to the Persians. 6th November. —This fact was publicly notified at Tehran. 1st November. —The Governor-General of India issued a proclamation declar ing war against Persia. nth November, —Several ships sailed with troops from Bombay to the Per sian Gulf. 12th November, —Sir H.

A few important points have to be noted in connection with the British operations in the Persian Gulf. {A) The status of the Resident in the Gulf during the operation.— On this point the orders of the Government of India were (Foreign) Depart ment letter No. 19, dated 1st November 1856):— The functions of Commander Jones as Resident will have ceased and he will have withdrawn from Bushire on the first declaration of hostilities ; but that officer's experience of the country and knowledge of the people will be of great value to the General-in-Com- mand and his services should be retained at head-quarters, to which he should be attached in the character of Political Agent subject to the General in Command/'52 (B) Question of selecting Bandar Abhas as the rendezvous of the British Forces. 192. In his telegram, dated 24th October 1856, Lord Elphinstone informed Governor-General that the rendevzous of Volume 11—31 of 1856. the force proceeding to the Persian Gulf would be Bandar Abbas. The Government of India, however, feared that the Imam of Maskat who held that port on a lease from Persia might object to the course proposed lest Persia should construe the admission of a hostile force in the port as a violation of neutrality on his part. The Government of India therefore suggested should any such objection be raised that the British vessels might assemble at Bassidore (Government of India letter No. 78, dated 31st October 1856). 193. The Bombay Government pointed out that the objection against Bandar Abbas being made the rendezvous of our troops applies equally to Bassidore, since the Imam held the island of Kishm (on which Bassidore is situated) on terms similar to those on which he held Bandar Abbas. It was not probable that the Imam would raise any objection to the arrange ment adopted, and Persia could not fairly make it a ground of complaint against the Imam as he had received no previous intimation thereof, and he was not in a position to oppose it, even had he the inclination to do so. A considerable number of steamers and transports had already left for Bandar Abbas and it was unpracticable to alter the rendezvous (Bombay Government to the Govern ment of India No. 180, dated nth Novembr 1856). {C) Question of neutralization of the coast Sheikhs and the enlistment of the coast tribes in our service.

No. 49, dated 20th March 1857, from General Outram, to Lord Clarendon (on board the ' Ferooz ' near Hartep, 4 miles below Muhammarah). Intimates that Rashid Pasha, Governor of Bassorah, declared Mahammarah to be disputed territory and objected to any attack there by the British, in virtue of the claims put fourth by the Porte. A further difficulty arose with the Turkish authorities namely, the removal of an Ottoman ship-of-war stationed in the channel before Muhammarah. Captain Kemball was despatched to settle these points, the first of which fell through in consequence of an unprovoked attack by the Persians on the ' Comet ' despatch boat, and in the case of the 2nd, Rashid Pasha consented to order the removal of the war ship. This the General looks upon as a sign of the friendliness of the Turkish authorities. Captain Kemball was further directed to secure, if possible, the neutrality of the Arab tribes and overtures were made to the undermentioned* chiefs to abstain from assisting the Persians and to withdraw their followers, in order to avoid collision with the British Army.53 No guarantee was held out to them, but they were promised an ample reward if found deserving. The success of these negotiations was displayed as the Ferooz steamed up to its present anchorage. At several of the villages the Arabs, male and female, approached the river unarmed, waving their flags and when the vessel anchored, several came on board volunteering to give any information in their power, as to the numbers and disposition of the enemy.

' Sir J. Outram points out in the 24th and following paragraphs certain political restrictions which he fears will so hamper his proceedings as to render nugatory his pro posed advance to Shustar, referring to that part of the instructions which debars him from seeking the aid of any but Independent' tribes. Her Majesty's Government adverting to this point have declared that they do not seek to subvert the dynasty of the Shah or to encourage insurrections on the part of his subjects ; that they have no wish to weaken the hold which he may have to the allegiance of his people, or to enlist the subjects of Persia in the ranks of the British Army, but that they would not hesitate to avail them themselves of any assistance which may be obtained from independent native tribes. Sir J. Outram observes that there are no such independent tribes ; that all are either Persian or Turkish subjects; but that as regards the former, they will become virtually our subjects when once our army is in possession of their territory, and that the objection to enlistment will then lose its force, I feel it necessary to say thst I do not think that in acting upon this view the spirit of the policy laid down by Her Majesty's Government would be carried out. So far indeed as regards our right as belligerents, and the practice of war, examples may be found of arms placed in the hands of native population, and of recruits drawn from it by an invading army. But in such cases the subversion of the dynasty and the weaken ing of the government of the country invaded have been objects sought, not shunned, S640FD54 In the present instance, seeing how decidedly, and I belike wisely, Her Majesty s Government deprecate any dismemberment of Persia, seeing how mischievous an example would be given to Russia in dealing with the subjects of Persia, and having regard to the future embarrassment which we should lay up for ourselves, I am of opinion that the enlist ment should not take place, I fear it is impossible to contend confidently that although we should effect a dismem berment for the moment, we should be able, upon the re -establishment of peace, to restore to the Persian empire its integrity. This, when we have once fanned the name of rebellioji, may be beyond our power, unless indeed we should be prepared hereafter to coerce into re-subjection to the Shah, the tribes of whose aid in the field we wish to avail ourselves : and such a course is not to be thought of. It must be remembered that enlistment into our ranks, and submission to the discipline and command of our officers, implies a service in a great degree voluntary, and of a nature far more offensive to the Persian Government than those smaller services which, as a matter of necessity, and for the sake of subsistence and self-defence, an invading army is compelled to exact. Such a service as enlistment into the British army is not, I apprehend, contemplated in Article VII of the draft of the proposed treaty between Her Majesty and the Shah, lately received from the Secret Committee of the H. C., which stipulates for an amnesty in favor of those who, from fear of damage to themselves and samilies, have afforded ' supplies and different kinds of service to the invading forces, whom they were unable to resist. The inhabitant of an invaded country may plead with truth that he is compelled by fear to surrender his stock, and his substance, and even to give information and some degree of aid to the enemy ; and the offence is one for which amnesty may reasonably be required from the Government when peace is made. But I do not see how this plea could be put forward by large bodies of warlike men, well able to escape from serving us, even if they could not resist us. Nor do I see that we could support the plea if they adduced it. It is also to be observed that in this war with Persia we have no interest in common with the Persian tribes. There is no common cause of quarrel, no sympathy except in hostility to the Persian Government. When the Shah shall concede our demands, the Bakhtian and the K'Ab tribes will reap no benefit from our success. They will have received our pay (if we enlist them) but nothing more; we have no thoughts of exacting from the Persian Government any concessions to them, if indeed we know what they desire. They may be supposed to seek the permanent weakening of the Shah's authority in a portion at least of his own dominions, and so far our object is opposed to theirs, not in unison with it. There is certainly no political bond between us. They would be our mercenaries, not our allies, in a cause, and I think there are grave objections to taking our mercenaries from the Shah's own subjects. As to the future, the fierce denunciations which the Persian authorities have issued against all who allow the invaders to obtain the smallest article of supply, might lead to the conclusion that we should not compromise the future safety of the Shah's subjects to any greater extent by taking them into active military service, than by trafficing with them. But it is scarcely possible that this should be so. There is, notwithstanding the big i threats of the Persian Commander, a real and wide difference between the two kinds of aid ; and if the opportunity and power of punishing a tribe for taking up arms in the British ranks should present themselves to the Shah's Government, it is not to be supposed that the vengeance would not be sharper and more determined than if the offence should have been the mere sale of provisions or camels. Possibly the Bakhtian and K'Ab tribes may be strong enough to defend themselves unaided against the ultimate consequences of their junction with the British force, but it is not to be expected that this will lead them to forego their claim to protection from us. If we meet that claim by requiring that they shall be included in the amnesty, we must watch the observance of that amnesty in regard to them with more than usual care, and we must be prepared to enforce it. Our obligations to the men who had stood in the ranks with our own soldiers would not be light. We should owe something more to them than to the peasants who had supplied our camp, and our debt would be greater from the fact that they would have gained nothing by the success to which they would have contributed. Upon the whole the enlistment of tribes from within the Shah's dominions, and whom we must acknowledge to be under his rightful authority, appears to me to lead directly to the future protectorate of a portion of his subjects. An embarrassing condition of things at best, and one which in this instance would be of the worst example to Persia's neigh bours. It is impossible not to foresee with Sir James Outram that an important means of success will be lost by abstaining from using the aid in arms, of those subjects of Persia who are hostile to its Government. But probably it is not necessary that their assistance should be entirely foregone because we refuse to take them into military service, or that unless enlisted into our ranks they should be actively opposed to us.55 Their aid in furnishing supplies and carriage, their forbearance from molestation of our convoys and sources of information, and from any marauding upon ground from which our supplies are drawn, might, 1 should hope, be secured by money and by friendly aud judicious treatment. As regards the Shah's troops I see no reason why the tribes should not be left to take their own course. I would not attempt to enforce their neutrality. If the Shah has misgoverned and alienated them, he must take the consequence. All that is necessary for us to do is to make it well understood by the tribes that we do not seek to put them in collision with the Shah's forces ; that it is not for this purpose, but for the purposes above mentioned, that we pay them and seek friendly relations with them. That for such services as we ask, an amnesty will be required of the Persian Government, but that beyond this we have no intention to interfere between the Shah and his subjects. It requires more information than the Government of India has at present at command, to judge whether any impediment to this course will be found in the character of the tribes in their relations to their Government and to each other, or in our position towards them. So far as my knowledge goes I see no reason to think that such a course will be impracticable. These are the views which present themselves to me upon a consideration of this important subject as set forth in Sir James Outram's despatch. If they meet with the concurrence of my Honourable colleagues, I propose that they be communicated to Sir James Outram, not as instructions, because these will come from Her Majesty's Govern ment who can alone explain, or if thought necessary, modify the instructions which they have already given; and therefore Sir James Outram has most properly addressed Her Majesty's Government upon the subject, but because in a question of much difficulty arising in such circumstances as the present, it is not right that the opinion of the Governor General in Council should be withhold from him.' Minute by the Honourable J. A. Dorin, dated 21st March 1857. I assent entirely to the line of policy recommended by the Right Hon'ble the Governor General. It is indeed the only one that can be adopted with prudence under the views thus far entertained and communicated to us by Her Majesty's Government in respect to the war with Persia. It must be remembered that so far as we are informed there is no intention of retain ing permanently any portion of Persian territory. That when the objects of the war are accomplished all acquisitions on the mainland of Persia will be abandoned, and knowing this to be the case it will only be a source of embarrassment if engagements are contracted with subjects of Persia which cannot be relinquished as easily as we shall withdraw our own forces from Persian soil. Her Majesty's Government have distinctly declared that ' they have no wish to weaken the hold which the Shah may have on the allegiance of his people or to enlist the subjects of Persia in the ranks of the British Army,' and it seems necessarily to follow, now that Sir James Outram has found that the tribes with whom he is likely to come in contact are not independent, as he had been led to believe, but are Persian subjects, that it would be contrary to the spirit in which the war is undertaken if any attempt is made to enlist them to serve as soldiers under British command against the Government of Persia. The neutrality or even countenance of these tribes over whom the Shah possesses little real authority may probably be rendered willingly, or may be acquired by good manage ment or by purchase or by other methods of self-interest, but beyond this it can scarcely be advisable to enter into engagements with men to whom the British Government can extend no effective protection and with whom they will have no link of affinity when once the ends of the war with Persia are accomplished. Minute by the Honourable J. P.Grant, dated 22nd March 1857. On the important question regarding the policy of enlisting Persian subjects into our ranks, to make war against their own sovereign, I have only to express my entire con currence in the view taken by the Right Hon'ble the Governor General, for all the reasons stated in His Lordship's minute. We have no quarrel with Persia excepting in the matter of her external relations, and we have no intention of taking the subjects in question under permanent British protection. Sir James Outram's argument that a temporary military occupation of a country warrants an inhabitant in throwing off his allegiance, and taking arms against his sovereign, because it warrants him in a temporary submission in matters civil to an irresistible power, is untenable. I think the proposed course would be unjustifiable, would be inexpedient, in the highest degree. On the question of communicating to Sir James Outram the opinion of the Governor General upon this point, on which that officer has received instructions immediately from Her Majesty s Government, I observe that this opinion is consonant with those instructions ; wherefore the communication in the manner proposed seems to me very proper. The expedition which Sir James Outram commands is an Indian expedition. The utmost56 effect of such a communication will be to confirm the General in acting upon his present instructions, so long as they shall remain unrecalled and unmodified by the high authority from whom they issue.

Measures were accordingly to place a detachment of troops at the Bassidore, (xxv) The Treaty of 1857. 195.

Various attempts made to establish Persian influence in the Persian Gulf, 1807-1905. XXVI.— Persian activity in the Persian Gulf, 1887-1888. 196. The year 1887-88 was remarkable for attempts made by the Persian Government to pursue an agressive policy in the Persian Gulf, and assert Persian supremacy to the detriment of the British preponderance therein. The leaders of the movement were Amin-es-Sultan, who held the reins of Government at Tehran, Sartip Haji Ahmed Khan, for sometime a Deputy Governor of Bushire and Malek-ut-Tujar, a wealthy Persian merchant at Bushire and an fortune -hunter who had held the customs and Government of Persian ports for some time. 197. In the month of August, whilst engaged in dealing with troublesome _ 000 M disorders in the vicinity of Bahrein, the External A., Tune 1888, Nos. //~&lt;i in \ 'J'X External a.. July 1888, Nos. 214-218. Resident (Colonel Ross) received mtorm- Guif Administration Report (or 1887-88. ation that the Persian Sartip (General) Haji Ahmed Khan was about to visit Abu Thabi and other places on the Pirate coast in the Bombay and Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company's steamer Calder. Considering the expense entailed by this trip, and the season of the year at which it was undertaken, the Resident suspected that the object in view was not, as given out merely to pay a friendly visit to old friends, but must be of a more serious and important nature. The Residency stezmzx Lawrence was despatched with the First Assistant Resident to Abu Thabi to observe the movements of the Sartip, and to endeavour to ascertain his purpose. It appeared that Haji Ahmed Khan landed at Abu Thabi in full uniform and remained with the Chief a few days, after which he went to Debai, whence he again returned to Abu Thabi and finally sailed in a native vessel to Lingah. 198. The precise nature of Haji Ahmed's communication to the Oman Chiefs was not ascertained at the time, the Haji having obtained promises that they would not divulge them to the British authorities. The Chief of Debai, however, whilst adhering to his promise literally, considered himself free to inform the Sultan of Maskat of Haji Ahmed's proposals, which were framed with a view to the establishment of close political relations between the inde pendent Chiefs of Oman and the Persian Government, to the exclusion of^ the present predominance of British influence. In whatever quarter the idea originat ed it is certain that those who were at the time entrusted with the reins of power and practically directed the policy of the Persian Government, had nourished an ambitious dream of replacing British by Persian supremacy oyer the shores of islands round the Persian Gulf. The action of certain local Persian authorities, including Haji Ahmed, was calculated to arouse suspicion of some such scheme being afloat, and attention once drawn to these proceedings observ ation served to establish the correctness of the surmise, after which the pro ceedings of the Persian agents at first puzzling, became intelligible, and acquired a meaning and*an interest. In the circumstances the Resident deemed it prudent and advisable in order to safeguard our position in relation to the Trucial Arab Chiefs of Oman, as well as to impress on their minds their own obligations to the British Government, to obtain from those chiefs written assurances of their intention of maintaining the existing status, which it was^ the obiect of Persian intrigue to disturb. Accordingly all the six Trucial Chiefs, addressed the Resident letters containing assurances to the British Government that they would neither correspond with, nor form engagements with any other Foreign Governments, and would not, without assent of the British Government, consent to admit to reside in their territories agents of any Government but the British. iqq In January 1888, Sartip Haji Ahmed Khan, having supplied himself External A, Feb ra a,y .888, Nos. 47-48. with a number of Persian Government flags External A, August 1888, Nos. 447-482. left Bushire on a special mission. Un this As regards Persian pretensions to Bahrein, before 1887 see Bahrein Pr6cis, 1854-1904' We ha ve already seen how Persia succeeded in overthrowing the Maskat power at Kishm, Ormuz and Bunder Aooas. S640FD58 occasion the Sartlp proceeded In a native vessel to a place on the promontory called Ras-el-Bibal, or Cape Musandim and desired to land, but was warned off by the Arab inhabitants. Subsequently, accompanied by the Sheikh of Kishm and some armed men, he visited Umm-ul-Kowain causing much excitement amongst the Arabs of that coast. Haji Ahmed gave out that his object in visiting Oman again was of a personal nature, but his real purpose was no secret. He was utterly unsuccessful and returned in disappointment to Bandar Abbas. The Persian Minister under whose orders the Sartip was acting on being questioned by Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, promptly and positively disavowed all knowledge of the Sartip's proceedings, and volunteered to reprimand him for his action. The Arabs of the Pirate Coast, being considerably fluttered by Haji Ahmed's appearance and conduct, were informed by the Commander of Her Majesty's Ship Osprey, which vessel was despatched for the purpose to the coast, that the Persian Government had disavowed and disapproved Haji Ahmed's proceedings. The presence of the Osprey and the disclaimer of the Persian Government had a re-assuring effect on the minds of the Arabs of the Pirate Coast. It may be mentioned that Sartip Haji was subsequently presented with a sword of honour by order of the Persian Minister. 200. The Persian agents were active also elsewhere in the Gulf—in Bahrein (see Bahrein Precis, 1854-1904, Chapter XXVIII), at Lingah (see Section XII above), and in the ,SVm'island see Section XXVII below. 201. Malek-ut-Tujar, whose enterprises were extended to these places, was soon discarded by Aminres-Sultan and deprived of the customs and Government of Persian ports. He then offered the Resident to make important disclosures about the intrigues of Amin-es-Sultan, but his offers did not receive much encourgement from the Residency. XXVII.—The Persian Pretensions to Sovereignty over the Island of Sirri, Tamb and Abu Musa, 1887-1888. 202. It seems that about 150 years ago, a portion of the Joasmi Arab tribe crossed over from Arabia, and took possession of Lingah, the head of the SecretE.JulyiSSg.Nos. 368-369, (No. 369). ^ ^ Originally, like the Shaikhs of Bushire. the Sheikhs of Lingah were practically independent, but by degrees they gradually came under the power of the Persian Government, and finally acknowledged themselves Persian subjects, paying to the Governor-General of Pars such tribute as he could get out of them. 203. The position of the Shaiks appears to have been very similar to that Colonel Meade's demi-offieiai, dated 13th De- of the Arab Sheikhs on the other side of cember 1888. w | 10 usec j ^-q a nominal sub mission to the rulers of Nejd, which the Turks claim as the origin of their own See also Section above. authority since they have overcome the power of the Nejd Chiefs. For many years, therefore, the Arab Shaikhs were de facto rulers of Lingah, being Governors or Deputy Governors of the place, and paying revenue either to the Governor-General of Pars direct, or more often to the official who has been Governor of Bushire and the other gulf ports. In the latter case the Sheikh would be styled the Deputy Governor. 204. In 1878, the then Shaikh, Ali bin Khalifah, was murdered by a servant of his own tribe though belonging to an inferior section of it. This man, whose name was Yusaf-bin-Mahomed, then became Shaikh, and ruled the place till he also was murdered in 1885 by one Sheikh Katib, a cousin of the Sheikh Ali murdered in 1878. ' 205. Shaikh Katib seized the Government of Lingah, and held it till Sep tember 1887 when he was captured by Haji Ahmed Khan Sartip and taken to Tehran. The same month, that is in September 1887, and immediately after the deposition of Sheikh Katib, Haji Ahmed Khan Sartip sent the Governor of Kishm Island to take possession of Sirn, and it was then that the latter with qo men erected the Persian flag on the island.59 206. No attempt at exercising jurisdiction over Sirri island had been made * c * u ooo m o. until 1887 when Haii Ahmed Khan, a needy External A;, September 1888, Nos. 85-90. . ' . J , . ' . adventurer anxious to advertise himseli and carry out what he understood to be the Sadr Azam's policy at that time, went about the Gulf trying to assert Persian claims to control and jurisdiction over Bahrein and the Pirate Coast, and the islands between that coast and the coast of Pars. « 207. When the British Legation at Tehran asked the Persian Foreign Minister to state on what grounds the Persian Government had annexed the island, the answer was that the Governors of Lingah had always held posses sion of the place and exacted taxes from its people and exercised jurisdiction over it (see letter from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the British Legation, dated 10th March 1888). The British Legation pointed out in reply that it was quite true that the Deputy Governors of Lingah had exercised jurisdiction over the island of Sirri, but this was not in their capacity as Governors of Lingah, but as Joasmi Sheikhs, that they had traditional rights over the island of Sirri apart from the position as Governors of Lingah under the Persian Government, which had been never disputed, and that their Arab kinsmen on the Oman Coast shared in these rights, which the Persian domicile of the Lingah Joasmi Sheikhs could not take away from them. 208. The Amin-es-Sultan maintained that' for nine years previously the Sirri and Tamb Islands had paid taxes to the Persian Government and that documents in support of this could be produced at Bushire by Malek-ut-Tujjar. When the Resident made enquiries as to what documents he possessed, he declared he had none. As a matter of fact the statement as to payment of taxes was made only by one Yusuf Khan, dependent and servant, of the Joasmi Chief Shaikh, Ali bin Khalifa, whom he had murdered in order that he might himself become Governor and Chief of Lingah. 209. The discussion on the subject was continued till August 1888, when , A „ , oo0 „ it was postponed by the British Legation, External A, September 1888, Nos.85-90. . . r j f . ,1 1 • r .1. in order to faciiilate the conclusion or the Hastadan boundary negotiation, which was then in progress. The latter question was settled in 1892. XXVIII.— Question about Persian claim to sovereignty over Sirri discussed in 1894-99. 210. The question about the exercise of Persian jurisdiction over Sirri was „ raised again in 1894 by Colonel Wilson, xtema . arc i 95 os 55- 7- Certain Arab subjects of the chief of Debai after receiving advances for pearl fishing had fled to the island of Sirri, and the Debai Chief applied to the Political Resident for assistance in claiming in re covering the claims against the fugitives. The Political Resident thereupon asked the Government of India for instructions as to how he should deal with the matter. The point was referred to the British Legation by telegram with theo bservation :— ' Persian claim still more untenable hy removal of the Jaosmi Sheikhs from office at Lingah and I trust you will press for removal Persian flag.' 211. The British Minister Mr. C. Greene wrote to the Sadr Azam, refer ring to the previous correspondence and the note received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs dated 25th September 1888, and stated :— ' In the nole above referred to, His Excellency stated that the Persian Government considered that no further proof was necessary in support of this claim, but no refutation was put forward in it of the argument of Her Majesty's Government that although the Government of Lingah had exercised jurisdiction over Sirri, they had not done so in this capacity as Governors but as Joasmi Sheikhs. Her Majesty^s Government maintain the view that the custom of the Arabs is sound and that the Joasmi Sheikhs represented the family only and derived no right from their position towards the Persian Government. 211. The facts and arguments stated in the Viceroy's telegram were also repeated, and the Persian Government re- External A, March 1895, Nos. 55-67. ^ 1 , . 1 1 _ £ 00 quested to give the necessary orders tor the removal of the flag. The following translation of the Sadr Azam's reply dated 6th November 1894 is characteristic of the Persian External a, March 189?, No. 67. method of arguing and stating facts A /6o Translation of a letter from the sadr A zam to Mr, GreE. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note, dated I ith September 1804, regarding the island of Sirri. You have stated in your note that the Joasm, Sheikhs represented their family only and derived no right from their position towards the Persian Government.' In reply, I have the honour to inform you that if the F ers.an Gov ernment had exercised jurisdiction over this iFland only in the time of the Joasmi bheikhs, and the inhabitants of place were Joasmis only, then the statements made in your note could be considered. Even when the Joaasmi Sheikhs were not Governors of Lingah, the Persian Government had always exercised jurisdiction over Sirri island. For example, when Sad-ul-Mulk (who was recently recalled from the Government of the Persian Uult and who is now in Tehran) was Governor of Lingah, he exercised jurisdiction over the above-mentioned island. Besides this I must state that the population of Sim has never been confined to the Joasmis, but people of various nationalities have resided there, and have always been under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Lingah. I must further state that the submission of tribes to each other in time of need has nothing to do with the transaction of business ; for example, the former of a property may assist his cousin in time of need when application is made to him, but in paying the rent or exercising juris diction over the property he would not take into consideration the relationship existing between them, unless bis cousin had to do something with the property on behalf of the owner, Considering the above fact, if the Joasmis have ever given any assistance, it has been for the sake of the kinsmanship, but in paying the Government dues, such as 10 per cent, of the goods shipped to the island, which are considered as Government taxes in the ports, they have alwavs paid them to the Governors, whether Joasmi or not. It cannot be con ceived that they have endured these impositions simply because they were kinsmen. The Joasmis have always joined with people of other nationalities residing in the island in paying the Government does to the non-Joasmi Governors. The Arab Sheikhs have always farmed the Government revenues of the island from the Governors of Lingah. One of these Sheikhs is Sheikh Yusul who, a few years ago, farmed the revenues from the Sad-ul-Mulk, and with His Excellency's permission constructed certain works, such as a reservoir, etc., in the island. 1 feel sure that these arguments will meet with your approval, and will leave no doubt as to the rights of the Persian Government over this island. I need not point out to you that the Persian Government will never remove their flag from the island in question. 212. Colonel Wilson discusses the Sadr Azair^s arguments in an interesting memorandum of May 1895, which is quoted Secret E., Norember 1895, Nos. 79-85. below In a reply dated 7th Jamad I 1312 (6th November 1894) to the note by Her Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affairesof nth September 1894, the Persian Government has set forth certain arguments in support of its claim to the Island of Sirri. His Highness the Sadr Azam, basing the Persian claim to the island upon the constant exercise of jurisdiction even when Joasmi Sheikhs have not been Governors of Lingah, states ' for example when Sad-ul-Mulk * * * * abovementioned Island.' This must refer to the period when the administration of Lingah and Bunder Abbas having been separated from that of Fars-Sad-ul-Mulk (as Muhammad Hassan Khan) was appointed deputy for the administration under the Amin-es-Sultan. Sad-ul-Mulk held this charge from June 1883 to March 1884, or about 9 months, in which short period, proof of an alleged long established jurisdiction can hardly be found. And it was about the end of this period that Sheikh Yusuf, who was the actual Governor of Lingah from 1878 till his death in 1885, wrote on 1st Jamad II 1301 (29th March 1884) to the Chief of Ras-el-Khymah, fully admitting the possession of the Island of Tamb by the Joasmis. This possession was also admitted by Khalifah-bin-Sad and Ali-bin-Khalifah, the predecessors of Sheikh Yusuf, as Chiefs or Governors of Lingah. With regard to the allegation that Sheikh Yusuf farmed the revenues of Sirri from the Sad-ul-Mulk, I would observe that Sheikh Yusuf himself held the Governorship of Lingah for six or seven years, during which he would in natural course, according to the view of the British Government, be concerned with the administration of the Island on be half of the Joasmis. The necessity for farming the Island revenues from the Sad-ul-Mulk towards the close of his period of authority is difficult to understand. Again the circumstances attending the assertion of Persian authority over the island, and the mode in which it was effected in 1887, certainly do not point to a long established and well recognized possession, which had been effectively exercised by the lease of the revenues in years immediately preceding. In September of 1887 ah armed party with two small cannon was sent to erect a flagstaff and to hoist the Persian flag on Sirri, and this proceeding certainly has not the appearance of an ordinary incident in the course of a long maintained possession. /6i It has constantly been alleged on the part of the Persian Government that Persian possession has been quite independent of the Joasmis, who have held authority on the Persian coast; and that it has been exercised independently of them, but there has been no proof of these allegations. Thus the Amin-es-Sultan informed Her Majesty's Charg6 d' Affaires in December 1887 that Sirri and Tamb had paid taxes to the Persian Govern ment for nine years previously, and that documents in support of Persian claims were at Bushire. Yet the then Resident Colonel Ross was at once informed by the Malik-ul- Tujjar, who was Governor at Bushire at the time, that he had no such documents. The proofs of the former dependence of Sirri on Persian authority which were asked for by Her Majesty's Legation in March 1888, have also not been given. On the other hand, it is certain that the condition of the Joasmis on the Persian coast in past times was not that of ordinary subjects, nor were their Chiefs who held authority there, in the position of Governors such as are usually subordinate to a para mount power. Nearly 150 years ago they crossed over to aid Mulla Ali Shah, Governor of Ormuz and Bunder Abbas, against his sovereign, and took possession of Lingah and other places on the coast. In 18^9 a British naval and military expedition against the Joasmis, after dealing with Ras-al-Khymah, had to operate against them on the Persian coast, destroying their boats at Lingah and attacking Luft. Similar action was necessary again in 1819-20 when the co-operation of the Prince Governor of Shiraz was requested in the operations against Lingah, Mughu, Charak and Tawanah, which had completely identified themselves with the Joasmis. The military force was, after the expedition, stationed in Kishm, then a dependency of Muscat. The conclusion from these historical facts is certainly not that the Joasmis having obtained a footing on the Persian coast, thence derived an authority over outlying islands, but rather that they carried with them to their new settlement a possession in the islands which they already possessed ; and the fact that a section of these Arab intruders later acquired the status of Persian subjects, and held their authority on the coast in subordina tion to the Persian Government as local Chiefs or Governors, cannot affect any original rights the tribes may have held in common. F. A. Wilson, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, 313. In 1899 Sir Mortimer Durand called for a report from Colonel Meade, Secret E., jm, .8 99 , wh ° a A ter del - ailin | in 0 a ''deini-official, dated 13th December 1898 the events up to the year 1887, added:— From September 1887 up to the present year, that is for about ten years, Lingah has been governed by Deputies of the Governor of Bushire, and, as far as our records show, the only act of sovereignty (over Sirri?) exercised by those Deputy Governors has been to send an official each year to levy a tax of one bag of rice from each large boat engaged in the pearl fishery and half a bag from each small one. This tax is levied annually at the close of the season. Our Lingah Agent reports that there are 18 boats engaged in the fishery and that some 200 men, Arabs from Oman and Soudanese, live at Sirri. Some six or seven persons (presumably Joasmi Arabs) go there annually to cultivate onions and water melons. No Persian officials live there permanently. The arguments in support of the claim of Persia to the island were first seriously advanced in September 1894, and I think we may reply to them as follow :—The Joasmi Sheikhs have been! the de facto rulers of Lingah for over 100 years. The Sad-ul-Mulk governed Lingah along with Bunder Abbas and the other gulf ports on behalf of the Sadr Azam from June 1883 to March 1884, but never actually interfered in the affairs of the place, following the example of his predecessors in the Government of Fars and Bushire by leaving the Government of the port of Lingah to Sheikh Yusuf, who was then the recognised head of the Joasmi Arabs of the place. I do not quite understand the meaning of the penultimate paragraph of the Sadr Azam's letter of the 6th November 1894. Does he mean that the Arab Sheikhs of Sirri have always farmed the revenue of the island from the Governors of Lingah, and does he imply that Sheikh Yusuf was one of those Sheikhs? If so, it would seem that he intended to mislead the Legation, for Sheikh Yusuf, though of course he was by tribal usage the Chief of Sirri, was alfo the Sheikh of Lingah and had farmed the revenues of the latter place as Deputy Governor from the Sad-ul-Mulk, but had not farmed the revenues of Sirri, of which, as I have said, he appears to have been Sheikh hy tribal custom and not by the good will of the Persian authorities. It seems only reasonable that, as he was in the double capacity of Governor of Lingah and Sheikh of Sirri, he should not have separated the revenues which he collected in the latter capacity from those which he obtained as the Deputy Governorship of Lingah: but this fact does not, I think, establish any claim on the {iart of the Persians, who left out the revenues of Lingah, to the ffith sovereignty of Serri, which Sheikh Yusuf appears to have held on a totally different tenure. * This demi-official report was brought on to ' official ' records in June 1904. See notes on page 8 of the Proceedings Secret E., February 1905, Nos. 26^-29$, C640FD62 The two leading Chiefs of the Joasmi tribe are the Sheikhs of Ras-el-Khymah and Shargah. The former has written maintaining conclusively that the Island of Tamb belongs to the section of tribe of which he is the head. 1 he Persians threatened to annex Tamb at the same time that they took Sirri; but were dissuaded from doing so. 1 he Chief of Shargah has pointed out that the deceased Sheikh Khalifah of Lingah was his uncle, and that his own father Sheikh Khaled once governed Lingah as well as Shargahi during Khalifah's minority. This shows, I thinly that the two sections of the Joasmi tribe have always kept up an intimate connection. It is true that the Sheikhs of Lingah had come under the rule of Persia prior to the time of Sheikh Khalifah : but the islands continued to be the common property of the tribe and did not become Persian territory. Colonel Wilson has commented on the manner in which the Persians proceeded when they hoisted their flag on the island. They did not act as old established proprietors would have done ; but behaved as if they were taking possession of new territory. It appears then that it was not till 1887, when Sheikh Khadib was captured, that the Persians felt they were really masters of Lingah, and thought they could take possession of Sirri and Tamb at the same time. They did not apparently realise that, although we would not object to their proceedings on the mainland, it was different as regards the islands, and that we would be bound to interfere where the interests of the non-Persian section of the Joasmi tribe are concerned 1 think it is quite clear that Sirri really belongs to the Joasmi tribe, and that the Chiefs of that portion, who live on the Arab coast, and are under our protection, have a distinct claim to it, and deserve our support against the Persian Government, whose occupation is distinctly a case of usurpation. If you wish I will write officially on the lines of this letter. It will strengthen our position If we make Persia withdraw and lessen our prestige if we sit quiet, and allow the usurpation to go on. 213. With reference to this demi-official correspondence, it was decided by Lord Curzon that the first move, if any, should come from Tehran. XXIX.—Qnestion about Sovereignty over the islands of Sirri, Tamb and Abu Musa discussed in 1903-05. 214. In January 1903 Colonel Kemball reported of the desire of certain „ . , - T 0 merchants that the island of Abu Musa ecret ., Ju y 1903, os. 4 . should be substituted for Lingah as a port of call for the steamers of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company. [At this time Debai also was attracting to itself the trade of Lingah, and already steamers of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company and Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company had begun to call there]. The Political Resident suggested that the Chief of Shargah, whose possession the island of Abu Musa is, should fly his flag on it as a sign of ownership. The Govern ment of India desired that the Chief of Shargah should be advised to hoist his flag not only on the island of Abu Musa, but on the sister island Tamb (letter No. 1283-E., dated 15th June 1903). 215. In April 1904, the Customs authorities of the Persian Government Secret e ., June!904, n os. 300-388. (SeeNos. removed the Arab flag from the islands of 366 -367). l amb and Abu Musa hoisted the Persian flag in its place and left some Persian guards on both the islands. The Viceroy in his telegram dated 13th April 1904, to the Secretary of State proposed that a gunboat should be sent with a representative of the Sheikh of Shargah to haul down the Persian flag, replace the Arab colours and remove the Persian guards to the Persian territory. 216. Sir A. Hardinge, who was consulted by the Foreign Office, was how- ibid, No. 376. &lt;iVer 0 P inion ^at before taking action as proposed by the Viceroy, it would be advisable to afford the Persian Government an oppotunity of removing the fla^s. His Majesty's Government concurred in this opinion, and Sir A &amp; Hardinge accordingly spoke to Mons. Naus about the action of the Persian Customs Secret E., February 1505, Nos. 259-293. Department complained of. Mons. Naus stated that Mons. Dambrain (Director- General of Persian Customs in the gulf) had been instructed by him in pursuance of the desires expressed by Mushir-ed-Dowleh to establish the Persian authority over the islands of Tamb, Sirri and Abu Musa, and to ascertam the exact nature of the authority exercised by the British Government at Bassidore. Sir A. Hardinge had little doubt that the issue of these instructions was connected with the Viceroy's recent cruise in the gulf, and that the Persian authorities had6 3 been advised by the Russian Legation to anticipate, while there was yet time, any seizure as a possible result of it by us of the islands or other strategic points in those waters. • • t • 217. For a further he account of the conversation between Sir A. Hardinge and Mons. Naus, and the measures taken for the removal of the Persian flag, we shall quote the former's report to the Foreign Offro dated 24th May 1904:— Mons. Naus was good enough to show me in confidence Mons. Dambrain's reports to him about his visits to Sirri, Tamb, Abu Musa, and Bassidore. The account of the latter place which I visited myself with His Excellency Lord Curzon, and of the nature of our claims to it, was very accurate. Mons. Dambrain reported that proposals had from time to time been made by Lingah merchants to move over to Bassidore and convert it into a free pore or emporium, but that these suggestions had always been discouraged by the British Residency at Bushire, as impracticable, and not really advantageous to British trade with Oman and the Arab Coast generally. As regards Tamb and Abu Musa. Mons. Dambrain stated that he had found the Arab flag flying, and had removed it, notwithstanding the pro tests of a care-taker who professed to represent the Shaikh of Shargah, and had hoisted the Persian flag, not so far as my recollection goes, on tbe same flag-staff, but on an adjacent spot. At Sirri- he had found no flag-flying, and had hoisted the Persian one without remark. He reported in this connection tbat no claim was made to Sirri on behalf of any Arab Chief. I observed that in 1888 we had objected to the assertion of Persian sovereignty over Sirri, but that the question appeared to have been shelved. I had no orders from your Lordship to re-open it, but I must ask that immediate instructions should be sent to . Mons. Dambrain to remove the Persian flags from Tamb and Abu Musa, Mons. Naus said he would at once ask authority from the Persian Government to this effect. Mons. Dambrain had, he observed, no business to romove the Arab flag. He had not been told to do so by the Persian Government, which was ignorant of the Arab occupation of the islands, and he himself. (Mons. Naus) could only repudiate his action. What he should have done was to make further enquiries as to the circumstances under which the Jaosmi flag was hoisted on these islands, and to report to Tehran for further orders. His Excellency thanked me for my courtesy in giving the Persian officials an opportunity of themselves rectifying this hasty step. A few days later Mons. Naus informed me that he had spoken on this subject to the Prime Minister, who was a little inclined to be obstinate about the Shah's rights and he asked me to mention the matter to His Highness. I intended doing so at my interview on the 8th instant, reported in other despatches, but the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, whom I saw just before it, begged me to leave the matter in his own hands, and assured me that he would himself settle it with the Shah. I accordingly called to-day at the Foreign Office to be informed of His Majesty's decision. Mons. Naus was present at our interview, and showed me a telegram which he was just sending to Bushire informing Mons. Dambrain that the question of sovereignty over Tamb and Abu Musa was a disputed one, and ordering him, with the least possible delay, to remove the Persian flag from those islands. I he Mushir-ed-Dowleh observed in this connection that the Persian Government considered it had a claim to these two islands, and reserved its right to discuss that claim with me. I assented, and expressed my willingness to submit to your Lordship any representations which His Excellency might do me the honour to make to me. 218. On 24th May 1904, Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed^ to the Government of India that the Persian Government, while reserving its right to discuss with His Majesty^s Government our resfectu e claims as to Abu Musa and Tamb, had telegraphed orders to Bushire to remove Persian flags and guards from these islands. In pursuance of the orders issued from Tehran the Persian flags were removed from the islands on the 14th June /iii, Nos. 264-272 and 283. 1904. (Telegram dated 22nd June 1904, from Major Cox to Simla), and a few days afterwards Trucial flags were hoisted by the Chief of Shargah's men on both the islands and two of his men stationed on each, 219. In his telegram dated 31st May 1904, Major Cox suggested to the Government of India that the present ibid, No. 26g. opportunity might be embraced to take some action regarding the Sirri island, in connection with which the position seemed indentical with that of Tamb and Abu Musa islands, and in his letter dated nth June 1904, he suggested that we should press the matter again on the Persian Government on a request to be made by the Chief of Shargah. From : 1 \64 a report of Commander Kemp to the Naval Commander-in-Chief, dated 9th June 1904, it appears there were posted on the ibxdy o. 275. island hired Persian soldiers in charge of the flag staff, that the Persian flag was hoisted in his arrival there and on Fridays. The Naval Commander-in-Chief in forwarding (letter dated 28th June 1904) this report to the Government of India stated that Sirriis an important island to us as are the islands of Tamband Abu Musa and suggested that similar steps be taken with regard to it as were taken in connection with the two islands. 230. In repeating by telegram dated 15th July 1904 this view to the British Minister at Tehran the Government of /i,.. No. 377 , India stated # ' Owing to the delay which has occurred in urging Arab claims, our case is not strong, but if the Persians advance further right# to Abu Musa and Tamb, claim to Sirri might perhaps be revived and at any rate pledge secured that the island will 7iever m any way bt conveyed to any other power 22!. When Sir A. Hardinge explained to M. Naus that it would be difficult Ibed No 2g2 for us to recognize Persian claims to it, be said he would strike Sirri out of the list if customs posts enumerated in the table annexed to the Reglement Douanier. He hoped, however, that we should not press for the removal of the few Persian coast guards, stationed on the island, which as a fishing centre was also a smuggler's resort. Sir A. Hardinge said that he had no instructions from His Majesty's Government on that point, but that we would prefer that a regular customs station should not be established there while the question of ownership was still uncertain. He thought, however, that we might recognize Persia's sovereignty over Sirri in return for an abandonment by Persia of all claims to Tamb and Abu Musa and a pledge that it should never be ceded to any Foreign Power. M. Naus said that he was preparing fair copies of the Regle ment for the acceptance and signature of the Russian Charge'd Affaires (Sir A. Hardinge to the Foreign Office, London, dated 19th July 1904). 223. In his letter dated 22nd July 1904, to the Government of India, Sir A. Hardinge expressed the opinion that if any representation were to be made to the Persian Government as regard the Sirri island, that no previous reference need be made to the Chief of Shargah as it would raise hopes which might be falsified later on. 323. As regards Tamb and Abu Musa islands, the Ain-ed-'Dowlah sug- ibid, Nos. 284 and 285. gested to Sir A. Hardinge that pending the discussion and decision as to ownership the Arab flags should not be re-hoisted on the islands. Sir A. Hardinge pointed out that the Arabs had only replaced the flags which had been pulled down recently by the Persians, while in the case if Sirri, the Persians had been allowed to continue to hoist this flag pending the decision of its ownership. There was therefore no reason to complain against the Arabs proceedings. It was also limted that any controversy on the subject of the Tamb and Abu Musa islands, might re-open the question of the ownership of Sirri, whose occupation by the Persians had only been tacitly and never formally recognized by ourselves^ (Sir A. Hardinge to the Foreign Office, dated 19th June and 20th June 1904). 224. Our energetic action in the case of these islands earned for us the /iid. NO. 283 (enclosure). &lt;} ee P gfatitude and appreciation of the Arab tribes on Oman, who could not have been very much pleased by our practical acquiescence in the occupation by the Persians of the Sirri island, an island which is inhabited by about 200 people ibid, No. 271, anti occu pies more important position for purposes the Pearl Fisheries than Tamb and Abu Musa islands. From the recent reports it appears that the Tamb Secret e, July 1903, Nos. 4 and s. island was used till recently only for grazing purposes by a few temporary visitors from the Oman Coast (Colonel Kemball's report, dated 30th April 1903,) Secret e., July 1905, Nos. in and 117. 20th May 1905 Hardinge wired to Major Cox.65 ' The Governor of Bushire has reported that the Sheikh of Shargah is erecting buildings which are forts presumably on the island of Tamb, and that the Persian Govern ment in view of these protest against its occupation have asked that this shall be stopped until the question of ownership, which they are prepared to discuss with me, is settled. I have pointed that the revival of this claim to Tamb meant the revival if ours to Sirri, where they built a Custom House last year. What are the facts of the case ? ' 226. Major Cox replied on 1st June:— 'Your telegram No. 91 regarding Tamb reached me at Maskat and on return journey I landed at Tamb. I had also visited the island on 4th April, the report which the Governor have sent to Teheran has not the slightest foundation, and I trust Your Excellency will take exception to these troublesome vexations.' 227. The necessary explanation was then given by Sir A. Hardinge to the Persian Government. On 13th July 1905 Mr. Grant Duff telegraphed to Major Cox that the _ ^ ^ XT . „ Darya Be^i had informed the Persian Secret e, November 1905, Nos 39-43' r* ^ ^ 1. i Government that he had been to lamb and that the Chief of Shargah had built 30 houses on the island. Major Cox re ported that the 30 houses were merely mud and thatched huts at the original village, that the reopening of the question was believed to be due to Russian promptings, as one Russian Consular Agent, Bunder Abbas, had accompanied Darya Begi on his first trip. Major Cox suggested that we should refuse to discuss fictitious reports regarding Tamb, unless the Persian first removed their flag from Sirri. Major Cox in his letter No. 350, dated 23rd July 1905, refers to the Russian intrigues in regard to these islands. He attaches great importance to the island of Tamb from a strategical point of view and suggests that we should adopt a firm attitude in view of the Persian movements at Sirri and Henjam. 228. In February 1905 some of the inhabitants of the Sirri island murdered , kT _ a British Indian subject at sea, and the Secret E, June 1905, Nos. 170 and 177. , . 1 • . .1 ^ t 1 murderers were taken into the custody by the Persian Deputy Governor at Lingah. Major Cox in reporting these facts by telegram to the British Minister at Teheran and to the Government of India (telegram dated 7th February 1905), asked whether he should demand this punishment as Persian subjects from the Governor of Bushire. The following view was expressed by the Government of India in their telegram, dated 17th February, to Sir A. Hardinge :— ' Please refer to Major Cox's telegram of the 7th February. We think that he should address Governor pointing out that as the Governor is no doubt aware the question of ownership of Sirri has been under discussion between the British and Persian Govern ments ; that in the present case that a British subject has been murdered, and that as the criminals are on Persian soil and in Persian custody, it is assumed without prejudice to the larger issue, that the men will be promptly and adequately dealt with by the Persian Government.' This telegram was repeated to Major Cox. [^5 regards Persian intrigues on the Arab Coast in igoo-oi after the revolution at Lingah y vide the Trucial Chiefs' Precis&gt; 1854—/poj. S640FD6? CHAPTER V. Residency appointments, establishments, guards and buildings on the Persian Coast and Islands. XXX.—The Resident in the Persia Gulf and his salary. 339. The earlier records of Government show that the salary of the Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, then designated u Commercial Resident at Bushire,' as fixed in 1801, was Rs. 784 per mensem ; but that Officer received in addition half the net profit on the sale of the goods shipped by the East India Company from London. 330. In the year 1806 the salary of the Resident and his Office Establish ment appears to have been fixed at Rs. 2,700 per mensem, but the details of this item are not forthcoming on the records. The pay then appears to have fluctuated between Rs. 800 and Rs. 1,200 per mensem, till the latter end of the year 1823, when, on the appointment of Lieutenant-Colonel Stannus as Resident in the Gulf, in succession to Lieutenant Macleod, the salary of the Officer was fixed at Rs. 1,500 per mensem in addition to a table allowance of Rs. 600 per mensem; establishment and house rent including boat's crew Rs. 600 per mensem; contingencies, Rs. 150 per mensem ; besides a travelling allowance of Rs. 500 per mensem when absent from Bushire on duty. This table allowance was afterwards increased by Rs. 500 (the pay continuing the same). Thus the records show that prior to the year 1831 the Resident received— Rs. Pay ... ... ... ... ... 1,500 Table-money ... ... ... ... 1,000 House Establishment and house rent ... ... 600 Contingencies ... ... ... ... 150 Making a total ... 3,250 per mensem. with an Office Establishment besides at a cost of Rs. 900. 231. This scale continued in force down to the year 1831, when the salary and allowances of the Resident in the Persian Gulf were fixed as follows :— Rs. Personal allowances (to cover all expenses) ... ... 2,400 per mensem. Office Establishment... ... ... ... 300 „ Total ... 2,700 „ 232. In the statements of the General Expenditure of the Bombay Presi dency for the years 1839 to 1844 the pay of the Resident is entered at Rs. 2,278- 4, but no information connected with this reduction can be traced on the records of those years. 233. In 1845 the salary attached-to the Bushire Residency was again raised to Rs. 2,400 per mensem, and continued at this figure till the year 1862. 234. On the 9th December 1862 the Government of India was informed that Captain Felix Jones, I. N., Resident in the Persian Gulf, having left for Europe, on leave, the Bombay Government had had under consideration the subject of adjusting anew the salaries of the Political appointments at Aden, Bushire, Maskat and Zanzibar. After stating the salaries of the Political Officers as they then stood, the Government of India was informed as follows H It appears to His Excellency the Governor in Council that British interests on the Persian shores of the Gulf will be amply represented by the appointment of a Political68 Resident at Bushire with Consular Powers in lieu of a Resident and Assistant Resident. The reduction of the Indian Naval establishments in the Gulf will relieve the Political Officer stationed at Bushire of most part of his duties as a disbursing officer and the post of treasurer to the Residency (Rs. 120 per mensem) can be abolished, the accountant bein£f entrusted with reduced duties in addition to his own. &lt;{ As regards the Zanzibar Agency this Government is of opinion that the salary of the Political Agent and Consul should be increased. The position of the Zanzibar is now very different from what it was when the salary Was fixed, and it appears to the Governor in Council most desirable that Her Majesty 's Government should be able to secure the services of officers on whose experience and judgment they can rely to fill this important appointment and the same reasons apply in a minor degree to Maskat. ' I am accordingly desired to submit the following readjustment of these two appoint ments and also of the Bushire Residency Rs. Resident and Consul-General at Bushire ... 2 ,000 Political Agent and Consul, Zanzibar ••• ••• 1 ,400 Political Agent and Vice-Consul at Maskat ... ... 1 ,200 235. In their reply from the Government of India, dated the 31st December 1862, No. 13$2, the Bombay Government was informed that their proposals for revising the Political appointments at Aden, Bushire, Maskat and Zanzibar were sanctioned in their entirety by Governor-General in Council. 236. Colonel Felly after an experience of four years, however, found that the . , . ^ x, salary of Rs. 2,000 was inadequate for the rinancial A, December 1800, Nos. 13-14. r ,1 t-i • 1 , 1 A . 1 post of the Resident and the Gulf, the res ponsibilities of which had increased with the increase of our interests in the Gulf. He therefore urged for the increase of his salary to the scale of pay which had existed previous to the year 1862. The application was supported by the Bombay Government, and the Govern ment of India sanctioned revision to the scale of pay which had existed before i ts revision in 1862. 237. In 1870 the Government of India proposed to increase the pay of the Finance-A., June 1870, Nos. 4-8. Resident in the Gulf from Rs. 2,400 „ to Rs. 3,000 on acctttrnt of the in- Fmance- ., ugust i 70, os. 4-5. crease of responsibilities, and to meet the increased expenditure by a reduction in the cost of the Political Agency at Baghdad. 23S. The Bombay Government, who were consulted, were opposed to any reduction of the pay of the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, but pressed a desire to see that Colonel Pelly's services were fully recognized. They thought, however, that his pay should be fixed not very near that of the Minister at Teheran (£ 5) 000 a y ear ) to whom he would be more subordinate than he was then, in case the Tehran Mission was placed under the icontrol of the Indian Government as had been proposed. The Bombay Government in the circum stances proposed that Colonel Pelly's salary should be fixed at Rs. 2,500 per mensem (letter No. 265, dated 5th August 1870). 239. The Government of India decided to increase the pay to Rs^ 2,600, the increase of Rs. 200 being met from Rs. 200 spent for the Dromedary post in Turkish Arabia, which it was decided to abolish (Government of India Resolution No. 35I -F., dated 30th August 1870).a representation of the necessity of an assistant, the Bombay Government decided to retain the post for the time being (letter No. 3351, dated 5th October 1861). 242. Under the sanction of the Government of India (see G. R. No. 2166, dated 29th August 1864), the designation of Head Clerk and Accountant was changed to that *' Uncovenanted Assistant in charge of the Residency Treasury ' and his salary was raised from Rs. 175 to Rs. 250. 243. In 1865 the Arabic Munshi having died certain changes were made* in • s. R. No. 2703-4, dated 2nd November 1865. the establishment which are indicated in G. R.

Two alternative proposals were submitted by the Bombay Government, of which one was accepted by the Govern ment of India, namely, that for the appointment of two Assistants to the Political Staff in the Persian Gulf—one on Rs. 1,000 per mensem and the other on Rs. 700. 245. On the recommendation accordingly of the Government of India the Secretary of State accorded sanction to the appointment of two Assistants— one on Rs. 1 ,000 and the other on Rs. 700 a month (despatch No. 50 -Political dated 16th July 1866). 246. The Government of India appointed Captain A. A. Way as First Assist- Voiume 1 -84 of 1867. ant Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Assist- . . . .. . . , ant Surgeon Hojel to be Second Assistant, continuing to hold charge of the medical duties of the Residency. The Govern ment of India objected to the latter appointment and wished that a Militarv or Naval officer should be appointed to the place (No. 154, dated 14th February 1067).m 247. In 1879 in accordance with the A. G r»gu«f88o^ s /iH 2 - 1 27. s ' ' l4-,25l Po1 ' recommendations of the Financial Com- mittee the following reductions were made on the Bushire Residency (Foreign Department letter No. 1945-8.8., dated 8th October 1879):— (1) The post of Second Assistant Resident was abolished, as there was not sufficient work for want of the Residency steamer, which had been removed, and the pay of the First Assistant was reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 800. (2) Assistant Surgeon (Abdul Rahim) on Rs. 200 was ordered to be replaced by an Hospital Assistant on Rs. 60 on a suitable provi sion being made for the officer in charge. 248. In his letter No. 111, dated 8th June 1881, Colonel Ross submitted a proposal that the services of Assistant General A., May 1882, Nos. 114-125. c* alj nr.- u* u • Surgeon Abdur Rahim, on his being • c c wvxr u 1 relieved from the medical* charge of ' See Section XXXV below. „ . . 1111 • , 1 1 Bassidore, should be appointed to be Native Assistant to the Resident on consolidated salary of Rs. 350 a month. He had served at Bassidore for 13 years without increase of salary nominally in medical charge of the station, but really as Superintendent of the Station with exceptional ability, and had been employed on special duties, sometimes of a delicate and confidential nature. His knowledge of Arabic and Persian and his profession and religion gave peculiar advantages in intercourse with the natives of the country. And since the abolition of the post of Second Assistant Resident, the need of an Assistant like Abdur Rahman had been very much feit. * 249. The Secretary of State sanctioned the appointment proposed on the understanding that it should be considered as personal and not as a recognised addition to the staff of the Agency (despatch No. 26, dated 6th April 1882). 250. Assistant Surgeon Abdur Rahim Hakim was in 1889 appointed to „ 0 officiate as Attache in the Foreign Depart- General a., November i 889» Nos. 29-38, j v ^1 . a / t „ ment, and it was proposed to appoint Mr. J. P. Liqueira to officiate in his place. As, however, the appointment of this Extra Assistant was under the orders of the Secretary of State a personal one, sanction of Her Majesty's Government was necessary for continuing the appoint ment. The Resident was asked to report whether it was still necessary to maintain his staff at the strength specially sanctioned in 1882. He replied that the circumstances which necessitated the appointment of Abdur Rahim were not materially altered ; and as more work was likely to fall on the Residency year by year he expressed a hope that he might be allowed to _ retain permanently the then existing establishment of Assistants. In this opinion the Government of India concurred and sanction of the Secretary of State was asked to the creation of a permanent appointment of uncovenanted Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on a salary of Rs. 350 per mensem (despatch No. 343, dated 29th October 1889). 251. The proposed appointment was sanctioned by the Secretary of State (telegram, dated 5th December 1889). General A., May 1890, Nos. 16-20. Assistant Surgeon Abdur Rahim having been confirmed in the post of Native Attache, Mr. S. Lucas was appointed to be Extra Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and J. P. Liqueira to be the Uncovenanted Assistant and Treasury Officer to the Resident (Notification No. 410-S., dated 13th March 1890). 252. In his letter No. 16, dated 8th February 1892, Colonel Talbot proposed certain changes in his establishment as External a., September 1892, hos. i48-i68, shown in the statement below, which were sanctioned by the Government of India (telegram, dated 19th April 1892)73 The above arrangement left the following appointments untouched Rs.

In 1899 on account of the Increase of work, especially consular work, the Government of India sanctioned enter- Extemai a., May 1899, Nos. 90-105. tainment of a Treasury Accountant on a pay of Rs. 130 a month with house-rent allowance of Rs. 10 per mensem ; and the Home Government sanctioned ^120 a year, out of which the salary of a Con sular clerk would have to be provided, the fee allowance ^30 a year attached to the post being withdrawn. (xxxiii) Consular appointments in Persia: Maintenance of British influence in Persia, 1S99. 254. With a view to the maintenance of our influence and protection of our interests in Persia and Persian Gulf Sir Secret e, November 1899, Nos. 9 -11. Mortimer Durand in his Despatch No. 16, dated 12th February 1899, made the following proposals, inter alia :— (1) Appointment of British Consuls and Vice-Consuls on the following places among others— (a) Consul for the Karun and Arabistan. (^) Vice-Consul at Bandar Abbas. (^) Vice-Consul as Native Agent at Bampur. (2) Appointment of a British Agent at Bahrein. (3) That the Resident at Bushire should spend his summer at Shiraz. (4) That the Consulates should have a guard of Indian troopers. 255. Lord Curzon's Government in their well known Despatch No. 175- Secret—External, dated 21st September Secret e ., November 1899. Nos- io-'- 1899, expressed concurrence on all these proposals except as to providing guards for the consulates, which they considered not advisable ' for the present' in view of the excuse it would give to the Russian for movements, ' for which not even the necessities of a plague cordon could be pleaded in justification.'

For some years past Shiraz has been the summer head-quarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and he has been provided with a suitable house at that station by the Indian Government. Under the scheme for the reorganisation of the Consular service we have seen, it Was decided to replace the native agent at Shiraz by a Consul drawn irom the Levant Service. In reply to an enquiry made by Colonel Kemball he was told in the Foreign External A., January 1904, Nos. 7 -s. Department letter No. 2486, External A., . t c - , ^ dated 'P'h October 1903, that the pro- posed appointment o. a Consular officer at Shiraz would not affect the question 01 the Kesident visiting Shiraz annually during the summer. (xxxiii-A) Proposal to appoint a Second Assistant Resident, 1505. 257-A. In his letter No. 79, dated 12th February 1905, Major Cox urged on General B., June 1905, Nos. 351-363. Government the necessity of appointing a ( j enC y Second Assistant at the Bushire Resi- Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel was at this time in the Gulf, having been permitted to accompany Mr. J. G. Lonmer on Gazetteer work on the condition that he paid his own travelling charges. Mr. Lorimer had to leave the Gulf in ^ T m v m the r peri0d 0f Gabriel's deputation with him expired on 31st May, Major ^ox proposed to keep Lieutenant Gabriel at Bushire for Gazetteer work and personal assistance. This he was authorized to do while dated'^hVarcriS ASS1Stant ^ COnsideration ( T ^^m. ( ,i 25 rj^-V^ r i n® ISt of Lieutenant Gabriel was appointed a probationer for , the P ollt ' cal Department of the Government, and was placed temporarily under the orders ot the Resident in the Gulf with effect from the 26th May 1905. On the expiry of a year or whenever his services could best be spared he was to be sent to the Punjab to undergo the training prescribed for all pro bationers (Foreign Department letter to Major Cox, No. 11 so-G dated i^t June 1905). o &gt; iXxxiii-B) Status of officers attached to the Bushire Residency. Grant of Consular rank to the F t rst Assistant Resident and the Residency Surgeon 1905 257-C. In his letter No. 173, dated 18th June 1904, Major Cox raised the Secret E., September 1905, Nos. 151-164. question of the precise status of the Resi dency Surgeon at Bushire. The Gov-W*J 75 ernment of India proposed to invest him with a Consular rank. Major Cox then proposed that the First Assistant to the Resident should also be invested with Consular rank. Sir A. Hardinge, who was consulted, agreed to the proposals, and suggest ed in the alternative that the officers of the Residency might be given a dip lomatic status, which would have the advantage of raising the prestige of the Residency and of emphasising the fact that the functions of the Resident and his staff are, unlike those of their foreign colleagues of diplomatic rather than a Consular character, concerned, as they are not merely with the protection of British trade and interests in Bushire and Fars, but with the political affairs of the Arab States and indeed of the whole coasts of the Persian Gulf. 257-D. Lord Lansdowne was not prepared, as advised for the time being, to grant diplomatic status to the officers in question, but saw no objection to giving the First Assistant the rank of Consul and the remaining officers that of Vice-Consul on certain conditions (Despatch of the Secretary of State, No. 44, dated 19th May 1905). 257-E. The Government of India concurred in the proposal to give Consular rank to the officers in question, on the understanding that such rank was local, that no allowance was attached thereto, and that it would give no claim to further promotion or to future employment in the Consular service. The only two officers at the Residency who did not exercise Consular powers were Captain Trevors, First Assistant Resident, and Captain Condone, l.M.S. Residency Surgeon. The former of these could be given the rank of Consul and the latter that of \'ice-Consul. The Government of India sug gested that the jurisdiction of both the officers should extend to Bushire and the other parts of Southern Persia. They recognized that the proposal involved some reduplication of Consular jurisdiction, but they thought it desirable that there should be no room for questioning the status of either officer at any point on the coast, whither he might have occasion to proceed in connection with his political or sanitary duties (Despatch No. 125, dated 16th July 1905). (xxxiv) Consular appointment at Bandar Abbas. 258. The necessity of the appointment of a British Officer at Bandar Abbas was noted, as long ago as 1879, by Colonel Ross, at that time British Resident at Bushire. It was raised again in 1882, 1884, 1885, 1888 and 1892, and on the majority of these occasions was supported by petitions from the not insignificant Hindu and Khoja population engaged in trade at Bandar Abbas. In 1893, the Secret E., March 1893, Nos. 562-578. appointment as Vice-Consul of an English- Secret e., November 1893, Nos. 568-581. engaged in business at that port was agreed to by the Government of India and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State (Lord Kimberley), but was subsequently dropped upon the ground that the estimated cost of Rs. 50 a month or ^40 a year could not be saved out of the Bushire Residency funds. In 1896, the question was again discussed between the Government of India and the Resident (Colonel Wilson); and the former so far de- Secret E., July ,896, Nos. 19-28. parted from their previous attitude as to say that the proposal must be held over until Secret E.,j u „e .89,, Nos. .50-.S3. the normal condition of trade had been restored by the withdrawal of the Russian's Sanitary Cordon (letter No. 912-E.A., dated 1st June 1897, to the Resident).' 259. In 1899 the Government of Lord Curzon in writing to the Secretary Sectret E, November ^ Nos. .o-n. 0f Sta i e in th f lV Despatch No. I 75, dated 21 st September 1899, expressed the opi nion (paragraph 82) that these conditions the Government had since been fulfilled and were prepared to look with a more favourable eye upon a proposal, the intrinsic recommendations of which were not open to dispute. They were willing to accept the financial responsibility for the proposed appointment, although they thought that it might be possible to meet it without additional cost by the transfer to Bandar Abbas of the Political Assistant now stationed at Meshed. Sir M. Durand had suggested that the officer appointed to this post should pass the summer months at Yezd (Bandar Abbas being an impossible f76 place of residence during the hot season), taking the place there of the present unpaid Commercial Vice-Consul. Upon this point the Government of India proposed to consult Her Majesty's Consul at Kerman, which was m close connection with Bandar Abbas and the coast; and promised to submit to the Secretary of State at a later date their final views upon this subject. 260. Soon after this, the Government of India learnt that Major Sykes, the British Consul at Kerman, was about Secret e., October 1500, Nos. 137-169. to ^ trans f errec i to Tehran. The pro bability of this transfer and the facts which had recently been brought to light regarding traffic in arms between Maskat and Bandar Abbas rendered it, irT the opinion of the Government of India, additionally important that our interests should be suitably represented at the latter port. ^ Lieutenant V. DeV. Hunt was therefore deputed by the Government of India in February igoo to Bandar Abbas as Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Sir Mortimer Durand was asked to obtain recognition of Lieutenant Hunt as Vice- Consul. The appointment was sanctioned only for 6 months and was to receive the pay of his grade in the Political Department, with a deputation allowance of Rs. 200. The Secretary of State's sanction was asked to these arrangements and was also told that proposals for permanent arrangements would be sub mitted as soon as possible. 261. In accordance with the exequaturs issued by the Persian Government, d spatch No. 3i »Secret—External, dated ist Lieutenant Hunt s Vice-Consular juns- March 1900. diction extended to the districts of Bandar Abbas and Yezd, and was, it is understood, to be independent of Major Sykes' Consular appointments at Kerman (Colonel Kemball's letter No. 151, dated 4th June 1900). 262. In June 1901 we communicated to the Secretary of State the sugges- SecretE , August 1901, Nos. 131-170. tion _ of the Politica^ Resident in the Secret e ., June 1902, Nos. 250-253. Persian Gulf that the jurisdiction of the Vice-Consul at Bandar Abbas, which included Bandar Abbas and Yezd, should be extended to Lingah ; and we added a suggestion that it should include Luristan and that the Consular jurisdiction of the Political Resident himself should be extended to the provinces of Luristan and Yezd. In reply the Secretary of State sent us correspondence with the Foreign Office, which showed that His Majesty's Minister at Tehran saw no objection to placing Luristan and Yezd within the Consular jurisdiction of the Vice-Consul at Bandar Abbas, and that he agreed to Luristan being included in the Consular district of the Political Resident, but considered that Yezd should remain under the Consul- General of Ispahan. The Viceroy agreed to the modification proposed in regard to Yezd. With his despatch of the 13th December 1901, the Secretary of State forwarded a letter from the Foreign Office which stated that an amended com mission would be issued forthwith to the Consul-General at Bushire, attending his jurisdiction to the provinces of Luristan and Lingah, and that steps w T ould be taken to carry out the other proposed change as soon as a successor was ap pointed to Lieutenant Hunt. In view of the temporary nature of Captain Grey's appointment at Bandar Abbas, it was not considered necessary to move further in the matter when he took up the post. As Captain Grey was now likely to remain on there, it was considered advisable again to take up the question, and during his recent visit to Simla, it was suggested to him that he might address the Resident regarding the extension of his jurisdiction. 263. In his letter No. 218, dated 6th November 1903, Colonel Kemball c . -J-. . . « . m , „ suggested that the status of our officer at Sec,a. E., Au g «s. .904, Nos. . 72 ..o* ^ g SS ^ ^ ^ ^ of a Consul and that as such his jurisdiction should be extended to Shamilat, Lingah and the Shib Koh Ports, Minab and the coast of Persia as far as Gwettar and all the islands belonging to Persia in the eastern part of the Gulf, that as Assistant Political Resident his charge should include Ras Musandim and the important inlets which this promontory contains, the portion of the Batineh coast which belongs to the Joasmis and the islands of Abu Musa and Tamb which are dependencies of the same family; and that our station at Bassidore should be placed formally under his supervision. The Government of India recommended these77 I proposals for the sanction of^ His Majesty's Government (Despatch No. 24 Secret—fcjctemal, dated 4th February 1904). The Home Government approved o them, and the Secretary of State told us that the necessary steps would be taken when the name of the officer intended to fill the oost permanently would be reported (Despatch No. 27-Secret, dated 3rd June 1904). 264. In September 1904, Lieutenant William J. Shakespeare, a Political General a ., December 1904, Nos. u-ig. Assistant of the 3rd class, was appointed , •, Consul at Bandar Abbas and Assistant to the Political Resident on the Persian Gulf. While so employed Lieutenant Shakespeare was to draw the pay or salary of his grade in the Political Depart ment, for the time being, plus local allowance of Rs. 200, which is attached to the Consulate at Bandar Abbas (Despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 222- General, dated 8th December 1904). Sir A. Hardinge was asked by telegram, dated 29th September 1904 to obtain the necessary consular powers for Lieutenant Shakespeare. On the 24th October 1904, Foreign Office informed the India Office that the necessary Commission would be issued appointing Lieutenant Shakespeare to be His Majesty's Consul at Bandar Abbas. The Foreign Office informed Lieutenant Shakespeare by letter, dUed 27th October, that he had been appointed by His Majesty British Consul for Bandar Abbas with jurisdiction in Shamilat, Lingah and the Shipkah parts, Minab and the coast of Persia eastwards as far as Gwettar and in all the islands belonein^ to Persia m the eastern part of the Persian Gulf. xxxv; The British coal Depot, Detachment, Slave Agent and Store-keeper at Bassidore. 265. Up to the year 1833, * the purser of the Commodore's ship on the Volume I, No 127 of 1859. Persian Gulf had charge of the stores at / Bassidore, and received the allowance of Rs. 200 monthly for that duty. This allowance was abolished in October 18^ (Marine Department, Bombay Government, letter No. 1075, datetl 18th October 1833), and the stores were transferred to the charge of the Commodore of the station This arrangement remained in force till 1859 when the Commander- .m-Chief of the navy received a proposal for an establishment to be entertained to look after the stores and the slave station. Before action could be taken 0n ^ h L eS ? .P ro P osals Commodore Jenkins reported to the Naval Commander- m-Chief m his letter^ dated 20th May 1858, that he had divested himself of the charge of the stores and appointed Mr. Mignon, Purser of his ship (the CUve) to the post of Store-keeper and Receiver and Superintendent of liberated slaves. This arrangement was disapproved by the Commander-in-Chief as it would deprive the Clive of the services of the purser, whose absence would prob ably lead to neglect and confusion of the ship's pay, accounts, etc. 267. Both the Commander-in-Chief and the Resident recommended that Volume u, No. 104 of i860. ^ :ie a PP 0 i nt: rnent of an European Store , , . . Agent and Store-keeper at Bassidore be abolished and that a native Agent be appointed on a pay of Rs. 30 per mensem 1 he new appointment was sanctioned by the Government of India (No dated 7th September i860). * 268. In 1863 the Government of Bombay decided that it was not necesssry Volume 1, No 103 of 1863, page 73. to maintain the detachment of the Marine 1 A , _ Battalion at Bassidore for the sake of a coal depot there. Before however withdrawing the detachment, colonel Pelly's opinion was asked whether there were reasons for its detention. xxxfl ^XxSTl^ G ' If P ' 5ds ' 1801-1853, Sections xxvii S640FD,8 , , , ^ ^ 260. Colonel Felly's observations are Letter No. 121, dated 14th October 1863, . . , . j . 1 ? interesting and quoted extenso below :— It seems to me there are under present circumstances but two points in the Gulf where you could conveniently stow your coal :— 1st, Bushire, 2nd, Bassidore. As far as the requirements of the Residency steamer are concerned it would in many respects be preferable to have a depot at Bushire. Because the steamer's headquarters would be here. And, secondly, because both coal and establishment would then be more compact and immediately under the Resident's eye. But, on the other hand, Bushire roads present serious difficulties for the shipment of coal. 2ndly &gt; the steamers would have to be four miles from the shore, hence boat-hire and homallage would be expensive. 3rdly, communication by boats is sometimes absolutely cut off, and is often hindered by bad weather. 4thly, Bushire being apart directly under the Persian Government, more or less vexation or at least jealousy might always be expected. It is probable little objection might be made to an unarmed Residency steamer coaling here. But I am by no means so sure that coaling by His Majesty's steam frigates would be entirely approved of. Again, suppose you have another expedition to the Gulf, it would be inconvenient to have your coal depot established in the enemy's port. As regads Bassidore the pros and cons seem to me briefly as follows - Firstly,—Bassidore has the disadvantage of being a detached point; hence supervision is imperfect; and this objection may apply with increased force now that there will be only one steamer in the Gulf. Secondly,—but, on the other hand, you must have a coal depot somewhere, and Bassi dore is ready to hand; much money has been laid out on it, and it has shedscover for your establishment arrangements, for recovered slaves, and also a Bundore. Vessels, again, can be within ^ of a mile of the shore I believe; and coal can be warped off; thus the coaling should be (though it seems not to have been) comparatively cheap. Thirdly,—Bassidore is perhaps conveniently situated for any of His Majesty's or other steamers that may chance to run short of coal. Fourthly,—Government are about to introduce telegraph communication in the Gulf. Their entrance station will be at Cassab and it may be well to have at a point so near as Bassidore the means of protecting any material held in store for that department. Fifthly—and on general considerations, a station at Bassidore is a point of obser vation and influence in that quater of the Gulf. Sixthly,—though it is easy to abandon a station in the Perisan Gulf, it may not be so easy to obtain one. If you abandon Bassidore, the treaty of 1856 between His Highness the Imam of Maskat and the Persian Government would come into force in regard to that point; and you might then find it difficult to re-establish yourself there, if future occasion should require. On the whole,—and though I do not altogether approve of Bassidore as a station,—I am not prepared to recommend its abandonment; at all events until I can see my way clearly to meet our immediate, and possible future requirements, by arrangements which may on economical and other considerations, appear preferable. Neither am I prepared to recom mend that a coal depot with the debris of our old establishment should be left at Bassidore without any protection. 270. The following resolution (No. 3773, dated 24th November 1863) was recorded by the Bombay Government:— Resolution. —Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly adduces strong grounds for the maintenance of Bassidore for the Government stores deposited as a coal depot ; while so maintained it is very necessary that some protection should exist on the island. It is also desirable on account of Bassidore probably becoming a depot for telegraph stores, and under the circumstances the detachment of marines should be retained pending further orders. 271. In 1865 we find the Assistant Resident in writing to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, expressing the opinion that the detachment for Bassidore consisting of 1 naik and 6 privates should continue to be sent to that station for the protection of the Government coal. The last detachment had arrived at Bassidore on May 1864. • A detachment was placed at Bassidore in 1857 during the war, but as to whether there was one before that year, records do not show.79 37 2 » In Government of Bombay Resolution (Marine Department, No. 271, Volume II, No. 13a of 1872. dated 1 3th March 1 872) it was decided to . transfer the coal station from Bassidore to Henjam ; the latter, now with a telegraph station, would be found more convenient than the former. Government was however then confronted with the question of the sovereignty over the island of Henjam (see Colonel Felly's letter No* 'Wo') dated 19th September 1872), and the matter was allowed to drop. Soon after Assistant Surgeon Abdur Rahman Hakim was appointed to the charge of the station. 273. In the Gulf Administration Report for 1873-74 the Resident reports:— The British station at Bassidorp has during the past year been under supervision of Assistant Surgeon Abdur Rahman, a guard of His Majesty's 21st Infantry is quartered here. The health of the guard has been good and everything has gone on satisfactorily. The pier having fallen into bad repair, it is proposed to repair it. The Chief of Kishm at a time caused some petty annoyance in regard to supplies, but these complaints have been removed.' The old establishment at Bassidore consisted of a slave agent and coal General b ., January 1875. Nos.26-33. agent on Rs. 30 each. In 1 860-69 the appointments at Bassidore of a munshi on Rs. 25 and a clerk on Rs. 100 was sanctioned. In 1874 the appointments of Bassidore munshi and slave agent were converted into the post of Arabic munshi at Bushire, and that of Bassidore clerk into the post of third clerk at Bushire (Foreign Department No. 2560-G., dated 22nd December 1874). 374. In December 1878 the company of the 21st Infantry stationed at military b ., October 1879, Nos. 15025 and 21 -25. Bassidore was ordered to be relieved and Gulf Adminstration Report for 187^-79, reduced to the strength of a havildar's guard owing to the unhealthiness of the station. One native officer, 3 havildars, 4 naiks and 62* privates then proceeded to Jask under orders of Government. This was in 1879. 2 75- I S8o the Government of India had under consideration the question Political a., August 1880, Nos. 124-27. of ^ transf er of the coal depot from Bassidore to Henjam, but it was dropped as it was decided to abandon the telegraph station on the island of Henjam. 276. In 1883 the havlldar's guard was removed from Bassidore to Bushire b , Military e., June 1883, Nos. 6 8. and since then no detachment has been sent Gulf Administration Report for 1883-84. t o that Station. The Services of medical subordinate were in consequence dispensed with, and the station was placed in charge of a coal agent. (xxxvi) Consular guard at Bushire. 277. The guard attached to the Residency at Bushire is an ancient institution, probably coeval with the Residency itself. We find references to reliefs of the guard frequently in old records. In 1856 it consisted of— Subadar Havildars Naicks Drummer Fifer ... Privates . Costing Rs. 545 ' per mensem. l 30. Commander Jones, Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, applied (letter dated Volume II.

Commander Jones supported his recommendation for the same reasons as those which were assigned by Colonel 'S.tTmkUkA,Ma Precis ,10,■„&lt;&gt;$. Cka, U r VI. the late p 0 l it i cal Agent in Turkish Arabia in his letter No. 8, dated 23rd March 1844. The advantages of a mounted escort consisted especially in the planner with which despatches and messages could be carried, and the facility with which information could be collected and conveyed. As moreover the escort was to be recruited locally, there would be no necessity for frequent reliefs. 278. The Bombay Government sanctioned the arrangement proposed (letter No. 4170, dated 30th August 1856). 279. The scheme however fell in abeyance in consequence of the war in Persia. In 1863 Colonel Pelly, Acting Resident, submitted proposals for reviving the measure with the following modifications:—(1) that the new escort be from India, (2) that it be maintained on the silladar system and that it replace the whole of th6 then existing detachment of native infantry, the acting Resident being of opinion that cavalry could keep guard equally as well as infantry. 280. The Commander-in-Chief, to whom the matter was referred, stated that the easiest mode of effecting the change required would be to call for vloun- teers from one of the irregular cavalry regiments, then undergoing reduction in the Bombay Presidency, and to offer the highest rates of pay allowed to silladar cavalry ; as the service for which they were required was a foreign one. His Excellency recommended that the escort should be composed as follows:— Volume II, No. 104 of 1863. 1 Duffadar at 2 Naicks at Rs. 33 each 18 Sowars at Rs. 30 each Total Rs. 58 66 54o 644 I Volume I, No. 74 of 1865. or an excess of Rs. 27-13-0 per mensem over the then cost of the infantry detachment at Bushire. 281. The proposed arrangements were approved by the Bombay Govern ment and sanctioned by the Government of India (No. 423, dated 15th July 1883). 282. It took nearly two years to carry out the new arrangements completely. In June 1865 the Resident informed the Bombay Government (letter No. 30, dated 16th June 1865), that the last detachment from Her Majesty's 21st Regiment, Native Infantry, serving at Bushire as Resident's escort returned to head quarters per H. M. S. Coroviandel in September 1864, and that the proposed mounted escort for the Residency being now completely organised, there was no further necessity for a detachment from that regiment being sent for service to Bushire. 283. From the correspondence of 1878 (printed in Proceedings, Political A., August 1880, Nos, 106—123), it appears that there was a detachment of 16 men of Native Infantry (Marine Battalion) at Bushire. When this detachment was sent there we have no records to show. In 1878 the Bombay Government wished to send a second company in addition to the one then distributed over Bushire, Baghdad, Bassidore and Gwadur, so that several guards might be more frequently relieved and looked after than it was actually the case. The Resident was asked8^ Government bearing the cost of purchasing horses and saddlery for the escort, as also the expenses on account of the feed of the horses. The members of the escort were however required to pay Rs. 2 each per mensem towards a chanda fund to be maintained for the purpose of keeping up uniforms and providing the cost of passages when the men return on leave to India. These arrangements were carried out successfully as reported by Colonel Wilson in his letter dated 27th February 1894. (xxxvii). Consular escort at Bushire and Bandar AbbaSj i 899-I9 0 S« 288. Though in their despatch No. 175 -Sec. External, dated 21st Septem ber 1899, referred to in paragraph 254 Secret E., November 1899, Nos. lo-n. above, the Government of India stated that it was not desirable then to increase the number of Consular guards we had at the time (at Meshed and Bushire), yet Secret E, August 1901, N0S.47-S3. ^ ^ Hardinge in his despatch, dated 2nd April 1901, to the Foreign Office, strongly urged the necessity of providing: every one of our Consulates with escorts. 1 he Russians had provided their Consulates in the north with Cossack guards and there were rumours that Consulates and Vice-Consulates were to be established at Shiraz, Mohammerah and Bandar Abbas each with its detachment of Cossacks. The impression created on the Persian minds of Russian power by these escorts could only be counteracted by similar move for our side. 289. Schemes were then prepared (1) of a cavalry contingent and (2) of an infantry contingent for services as Consular guards in Persia. The cavalry contingent (150 men with 2 British officers) was to be of selected volunteers of the Silladar Cavalry of the Punjab, Bengal and Bombay Commands and of the Hyderabad Contingents. Owing to the small number of Shiahs serving on the native army and to its being undesirable to mix them with Sunnis, the contingent was to compose wholly of the latter or Sikhs and Hindus. The infantry was to compose of 145 native Musalmans (Sunni) officers and men and 2 British officers to be drawn from various commands. 290. For Bandar Abbas our proposal was that one guard should consist of Secret e ., October 1904. No S . 498-624 (No. 4 non-commissioned officers and 12 men 609). infantry, and one non-commissioned officer and three sowars to be lent from the Bushire escort, for the Consul's tour, the Bushire guard being increased by the latter number. The Political Resident, however, drew our attention to the fact that Secret e , June 1905, Nos. 339—349- escort consisted of ex-soldiers espe cially engaged : it was in fact a civil escort, its members serving on a civil con tract and not subject to military discipline. The engagements of seven of them expire in October 1906 and of two others in September 1907. The Government of India desired that their status should be changed, by replacing the men by soldiers seconded from their regiments for a limited period as soon as the men at present employed completed the term of service for which they have been engaged. Thus the Bushire escort would be placed on conditions of service similar to those which apply to escorts serving at other British Consulates (Foreign Department letter No. 3043 -E. A., dated 20th October 1904). 291. The Government of India at the same time thought that the adoption Foreign Department letter No. 1868 -E. a., dated at present of the original scheme for in- 17th May 1905. creasing the Bushire Corps by the addition of four sowars in order to provide a travelling guard for the Consul at Bandar Abbas would result in the undesirable arrangement of locating a mixed detachment at Bushire composed partly of soldiers of the Indian army and partly ,of civil sowars serving on a contract engagement. In these circumstances it was proposed for the present at any rate to abandon the idea of providing a travelling escort for the Consul at Bandar Abbas from the detachment at Bushire and instead to send for this service direct from India to Bandar Abbas a separate unit consisting of one non-commissioned officer and three sowars who would serve on terms similar to those of the escorts recently posted to Ahwaz, Khar- mansha and other places. The Bushire corps was thus to be left at its existing83 sping gxisiir's strength until October 1906. when its place could be taken by a detachment of regular cavalry. The two men of the Bushire corps whose contract do not expire till 1907 and who are liable for service in any part of the Gulf could probably, on the detachment intended for Bushire arriving at that post, be employed usefully at some other place under the Resident's charge. (xxxvii-A). Medical arrangements at Bandar Abbas. 291 A. Arrangements were made to depute an hospital assistant, Ali Husein, by name to Bandar Abbas, at the com- External a.. April 1901, Nos. 17-22. y r ., o ~ * J mencement ot the year 1900. He evinced the greatest willingness to remain at Bandar Abbas and was ordered back in February 1901. 291B. As regards permanent medical arrangements at Bandar Abbas Lieutenant Hunt made a proposal for opening a charitable dispensary at the place for the time being under the supervision of the Assistant burgeon in charge of the quarantine arrangements. He could also attend on the Vice- Consul and his establishment.. 291C. The British Minister was asked by the Resident to ascertain whether the Persian Government would external a., June 1902, Nos. 23-24. view with favour the proposal to establish a charitable dispensary at Bandar Abbas under the supervision of the Assistant Surgeon, an officer lent to them for quarantine purposes. No reply was received by the Resident until he wrote to the Government of India on 21st April 1902. 291D. Meanwhile the Government of India directed (No. 1160-E. A., dated 7th June 1902) that the Assitant Surgeon in question should be called into attend the Vice-Consul and his establishment when necessary. The Persian Government would not apparently take exception to this arrangement. The additional duties thrown on the Assistant Surgeon being light, he was expected to undertake them without, extra remuneration. (xxxviii). Residency buildings at Bushire. 292. The history of the Residency buildings at Bushire is involved in great obscurity. The following meagre details Volume iv, 87 of 1867, page 91. have been gathered from an account written by Colonel Pelly in 1867 {vide his letter to the Bombay Government No. 94, dated 13th August 1867) and casual references are made in our records. Originally a residency or factory was held by us outside the town, but that building was afterwards given up, and the Residency located in the centre of Bushire. The Resident finding probably a position in the heart of the town inconvenient, another spot was selected within the town walls but close to the shore line. This last removal occurred some 90 years ago. At that time Bushire was governed by a (/w^z-independent Arab Shaik and arrangements were entered into with him, whereby the ground now contained within the Resi dency limits together with some native huts then standing on it was made over to the English Government at a monthly rental of 100 rupees. On the site thus secured, a portion of the present Residency was constructed and the native huts were repaired and converted into servants' houses and store-rooms. In course of time the Shaikhs of Bushire disappeared, the town fell under the direct Govern ment of Persian authority, and the Residency ground which (as before stated) had, in the first instance, belonged to the Shaik alone, was purchased in piece meal by various private individuals ; and from that time the total of the rental, viz., 100 rupees per mensem was paid in fractions to the several purchasers. Subsequent additions were made to the Resitiency buildings down to the period of the Persian war in 1856-57. 293. After the revolution* of 1827 it was proposed that a defensible •s«e Section lv of Persian guf Precis, iSo.- Residency should be built at Bushire, but 1853- the Resident (Captain Wilson) pointed out that any move in this direction would rouse Persian suspicions. He, however, secured material strength to the Residency by erecting lines for the guard adjoin ing that building. f H ' h v \ v i ■ :84 ■. I ! ' : SSlfi *3' 1 ? iilii 294* For many years past each of the members of this Residency had, Captain Jones's letter, dated 31st January 1862, through the consideration of the Persian Volume 11,80 of I 862. Government, been permitted to build sum mer quarters for themselves on the desert plains about 16 miles distant from Bushire. During the Persian war these dwellings were for the most part destroy ed and in 1858 on Captain Jones's application a new site was conceded for erec tion of new premises. But in the course of erection gross representations were made to Tehran respecting the Resident's own quarters. A plan of these was then called for and submitted, and the building was completed without in terruption.* 295. In i860 a petty bungalow was commenced to be built by the Resident for the Civil Surgeon. No objection to its erection was offered at the time, but presently the Resident found that the Persian Ministers were prepared to retaliate a want of subserviency to their views in respect to Bahrein by reagitating the question of the summer residences on the plausible ground of the bounds of Persian conces sion having been transgressed by erection of the Civil Surgeon's house and other little additions not in the plan. A pretext was wanted, and when found had been reserved for re-agitation at a convenient season. Exaggerated reports of the Resident's opposition to Persian supremacy at Bahrein led to re-agitation of the question of the summer dwelling in the neighbourhood of Bushire. 1 he Resident offered in the winter of i860 to place all the premises at the disposal of the Persian Government. 296. In the month of October 1861 after a discussion unfavourable to Persia respecting Bahrein had been made by Her Majesty's Government, the Persian Government ordered the demolition of the Civil Surgeon's summer abode. Dr. Wood's abode was razed to the ground on the night of the 25tn January 1861, and a portion of the Residency premises also threatened : vindictiveness towards strangers and guests in a foreign land had never before been so marked. 297. In April 1869 Colonel Pelly addressed a despatch to Mr. Alison enclos- S-H. 1870, Ncs. 34-35. ing medical reports on the unhealthiness of ' . 1 10 ' ll3 ' 116 the town of Bushire owing to the absence of sanitary arrangements and the practice of intra-mural interment and request ing his good offices in ascertaining whether the Persian Government would concede or permit the Indian Government to purchase a sufficient area outside the town where a Residency and buildings required by the staff and dependents might be constructed. 298. But Mr. R. Thomson, Her Majesty's Charge, d'Affaires reported that the Shah was unwilling to grant his consent to the measure. His Majesty stated that the position of the Residency within the town was a very good one, close to the sea and that no wish haying been expressed, during the number'of years that the Residency had been inside the town, for making any change, no necessity was shown for the proposed measure (Mr. Thomson to Colonel Pelly dated 27th September 1869). In these circumstances the Government of India thought that there was no necessity for taking any further steps in the matter for the^ time being (Govern ment of India to the Secretary of State, No. 12, dated 15th February 1870).

S640FD \; i ■■ F: '11S7 CHAPTER VI. British extra-territorial jurisdiction on the Persian Coast and Islands. (xxxix) The early difficulties of our Agents in exercising jurisdiction. 299. The history of the British extra-territorial jurisdiction on the Persian Coast and Island is a long and complicated one. No serious attempt was made until recently to place our jurisdiction in the Gulf on a clear footing : the British commercial interests in Persia were after the flutter of about a decade at the commencement of the 19th century relegated to an obscure corner in our foreign policy until the treaty of 1857 secured to us the most favoured nation's treatment. Even then it took some 15 years before the Resident on the Gulf was invested with consular powers, and it was only in 1889 that a Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council was passed, which authorized him and his assistants to exercise certain judicial powers. Until that year a good deal of correspondence was carried on with a view to clear our jurisdictional position on Persia. We had to resort to many a makeshift for exercise of judicial powers by our officers. In this precis an attempt will be made to unravel the tangled skein of the endless corres pondence and discussion on the subject. 300. Under article 2 of the Commercial Treaty of 1841, it was agreed that the British Government could maintain two commercial agents in Persia, one at Tabriz, who alone would be honored with the privileges of a Consul-General, and the other the Resident at Bushire. There is no provision in the treaty for appointing the Resident at Bushire to be a Consul, 301. In 1844 Major Hennell having applied to be vested with consular powers, the proposal was referred to the Court of Directors and it was held by them that the grant of consular powers would be inconsistent with the Com mercial Treaty referred to above (despatch of the Court dated 12th March 1845). 002. In 18^5 Captain Felix Jones referring to the Act 18 and 19 Vic. Chapter XL11 and Her Majesty's order in council dated 1st May 1855 suggested that the Resident at Bushire, without being named a Consul-General should be granted the full powers and privileges of that office, with a view to legalize the awards decisions or sentences that might be pronounced by him on matters com ing before him, more particularly in respect to those bearing upon seamen and mercantile shipping interests abroad. It was pointed out by the Bombay Gov ernment to Commander Jones that, in making this suggestion, he seemed to have lost si^ht of the despatch of the Court of Directors of 1845, cited above, which it appeared to the Government to militate against the adoption of the arrange ment he had proposed. Copy of Commander Jones's letter was sent to the Court vi of Directors, who approved of the reply Voiumft fn of 1856. given by the Bombay Government to Com mander Jones (despatch No. 25 of 21st May 1856). «oo. In 18^6 Pachabhoy Tejsee, a merchant of Bombay, solicited the aid of . ^ u o m Government to enable him to recover a sum Political A., December 1871, Nos. 37 6 -383 r .. , , , , . 1 • , .1 (No. 380). . of money alleged to be due to him by the Chief of Lingah, and the matter having been referred to the Political Resident that officer despatched an Indian navy vessel to Lingah with the object of procuring payment of the claim (Krans 1,500). 'The obiect o( the dive's visit (instructions for commander) is to impress upon the Shaikh ot Lingah the necessity of complying with demands which had been long evaded under some pretext or other. For this purpose a firm tone should be adopted by her commander without committing us to any direct course of action, dependent, as that is, on the policy Which Her Majestv's Minister in Persia may deem fit to adopt for the recovery of claims upon parties now living under Persian protection on the shores of this Gulf. But vou may authorise him to decline receiving either letter or excuse in reply to my demand, but that on expiration of the period named, it the money is not received, he may quit the port on his return here, intimating to the Shaikh that he may now expect to be dealt with in another form/' 001. This proceeding was approved by Government, with the exception of the threat held out at the close of the instructions. The Honourable the late88 Court of Directors, however, in their despatch with reference to this matter (dated 7th July, No. 19 of 1858) stated 'We wish it to be explained on what ground it is considered part of the duty of the British representative to recover sums lent by the natives of India 10 Arab Chiefs, such a proceeding being totally opposed to the general principles which regulate our relations with Native States.' 302. In reply to these remarks Captain Jones stated :— ''The recovery of sums lent by our subjects to Arab Chiefs does in reality form no part of the duty oi the British representative in these parts, though in his intercourse with the Chiefs and people he has always endeavoured by friendly remonstrances to advance their claims by recommending them to the Chiefs, so that they may receive attention m regions where, without the occasional countenance of protecting authority, their mercantile transactions and British Indian trade in general would be precarious if not altogether stagnant. ' With respect to the case cited in the paragraph in question, it was a gross one partaking of the nature of a fraud in which the British Agent at Lingah was in some way involved and through him likely to prove detrinmental to the appellant, Pachahbhoy Tejsee. It seemed to me one, therefore, requiring more than ordinary interference, and while con demning the conduct of the Agent, I deemed it also incumbent on me to exert myself in the recovery of the sum, which was at last effected, in the manner reported. 'At the same time I am fully impressed with the correction iViX the adjustment of ordinary transactions between British Native traders and the Chiefs and the people of these regions should not come under the consideration of the British Resident, conducted as such transactions are, in a complicated and usurious manner, peculiar to a needy popula tion on the one hand, and a highly speculative and exacting class like the banians on the other. Indeed were interference the rule instead of the exception, it would necessitate Courts of Appeal and British Consular authorities in every petty locality of the Gulf. Moreover, owing to the insecurity attending trade in all Arab localities, I have more than once promulgated to those engaged in trade warning that they are pursuing it at their own risk. The profits are, however, so great that they are heedless of temporary losses and continue in the prosecution of gain, content with the assurances of our general protection against open insult or oppression.' 303. The Bombay Government, thereupon, decided that— ' The Resident should, as a general rule, abstain from all interference with the claims of merchants against Chiefs and others on the shores of the Persian Gulf'' And the Secretary of State, with reference thereto, observed— ' Her Majesty's Government are extremely desirous to avoid all useless interference with the pecuniary and commercial transactions of these Arab Chiefs and tribes, and cordially approve the orders issued by you on the subject. ,, (xl) The reading together of the Treaty of Paris, 1857, and the Treaty of the Tur- komanchai 1828 Commercial Contract. 304. Article 9 of the treaty of Paris («) 1857 concluded* between Persia and Aitchison's Treaties, Volume X, Persia, No, England a,t the dose of the War between XVI111 the two countries in 1856-57 provides as follows :— ''That on the establishment and recognition of Consuls-General, Consuls, Vice-Consuls and Consular Agents, each shall be placed in the dominions of the other on the footing of the most favoured nation ; and that the treatment of their respective subjects and their trade shall also, in every respect, be placed on the footing of the treatment of the subjects and commerce of the most favoured nation.' 305. Up to the year 1858 and for many years afterwards the most favour able treatment in this respect was secured to foreigners in the clauses quoted below in the special Separate Compact added to the Treaty of Turkomanchai between Russia and Persia, 1828, Aitchinson's Treaties, Volume X, Appendix 6, Persia :—■ Article 7, &lt;c All lawsuits and litigation between Russian subjects shall be submitted exclusively to the investigation and decision of the Mission or of the Consuls of Russia in confor mity with the laws and customs of the Russian Empire.

Whenever any disputes or lawsuits shall arise between • Note.

If 89 Russian and Persian subjects, the said lawsuits or disputes shall be brought before the Hakim or Governor, and shall not be investigated and decided except in the presence of the Dragoman of the Mission or of the Consulate. One judicially disposed of such suits shall not be allowed to be instituted a second time. If, however, circumstances should be of such a nature as to render a second trial necessary, it shall not take place without previous intimation being given to the Minister, or the Charge d'Affaires, or the Consul of Russia, and in that case the action shall be brought and decided only in the Dufter, that is to say, in Supreme Court of the Shah at Tabriz or at Tehran, likwise in the presence of a Dragoman of the Mission or of the Russian Consulate. Article 8, In case of murder or any other crime committed among Russian subjects, the inves tigation and decision of the case shall be within the exclusive province of the Minister, or Charge d'Affaires, or Consul of Russia in virtue of the jurisdiction delegated to them over their own countrymen. If a Russian subject should happen to be implicated with indivi duals of another nation in a criminal suit, he shall not be prosecuted nor molested in any way without proofs of his participation in the crime; and even in that case, as in the one in which a Russian subject should be charged with direct culpability, the tribunals of the country shall not be competent to proceed with the trial and judgment of the crime except in the presence of a delegate of the Mission or of the Russian Consulate, and if there should be none on the spot in which the crime has been committed, the local author ities shall take steps, to send the delinquent to a place to where there is a Consul or a consti tuted Russian Agent. The evidence both for and against the accused shall be faithfully taken by the Hakim and by the Judge of the place, and attested by their signature : trans mitted in this form to the place where the offence is to be tried ; this evidence shall con stitute a record or authentic summary of the proceedings, unless the accused should clearly demonstrate the falsity of the same. When the accused shall have been duly convicted and the sentence passed, he shall be handed over to the Minister, or Charge d'Affaires, or Consul of His Imperial Majesty, who shall send him back to Russia, there to receive the punishment awarded by the law. (xli) The Resident's power to solemnize marriages, 1864. 306. In a letter, dated the 9th November 1863, Lieutenant-Colonel L. Pelly, TT _ t 0 . Acting Political Resident at Bushire, asked Volume II, 83 of 1864. i o d -j i the question whether as Resident he is empowered to solemnize marriages within his jurisdiction under 12 and 13 Vic., cap. 68.' 307. This question was referred for the opinion of the Advocate General and the Government Solicitor submitted the Advocate General's opinion as follows :— ' The Persian Gulf, so far as it forms part of Persian territory, is a foreign place or country within the meaning of Act 12 and 13 Vict., cap. 68, and if there be a British Consul duly appointed and authorized under section 19 of the above Act to act there, marriages may be solemnized by such Consul, or allowed by him to be solemnized by any other person in his presence at the British Consulate and in the presence of two or more witnesses. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf is not, qua Resident, empowered by the above act to solemnize any marriages. He may be allowed to do so by the Council, if there be a duly appointed and authorized Consul, but without such permission he cannot of his own authority perform any such marriage.' ' I K f (xlii) Extension of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to Persia and the Persian Gulf. 308. On the 19th of April 1866, Lord Clarendon, then Her Majesty's See k . w. Proceedings, Political 1866, Sept* Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, ember, No. 22. wrote to the Consul-General at Constanti nople, instructing him to prepare a draft of an order to apply the provisions of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act (6 and 7 Vic., cap. 84) to Persia. Lord Clarendon observed that, as regards the Resident at Bushire, it seemed doubtful whether a Consular commission could be issued to him, although he might be empowered by the Queen in his proper capacity to exercise such jurisdiction as may be required over British subjects at Bushire and in its neighbourhood. Another point to be borne in mind was the manner of dealing with Indian subjects of Her Majesty in civil and criminal cases. Lord Clarendon directed that when the draft order was framed at Constantinople, it was to be sent home and submitted to the India Office and law officers of the Crown. S64.0FD90 309. In forwarding these papers to the Bombay Government, the Secretary of State ordered that the Resident at Bushire should communicate his views to the Consul-Gereral at Constantinople, and furnish him with any advice or See Proceedings, Political A., February 1870, Suggestions. Th.sCoIonel Pelly did On No. 204. 3rd October i860. His suggestion was that, as respects the Gulf, there should be a Central Consular Court at Bushire, and that the Agents at Maskat and Gwadur should have local Courts ; that the Consul-General should have power to give his Assistant at Bushire Vice-Consular authority ; and that the Act should provide for all cases happening at sea within the Gulfs of Oman and Persia. 310. As it did not appear that anything further had been done to apply the Foreigners 5 Act to Persia and the territories on the Gulf, the Government of India M on the 1 st of February 1870 asked the Sec- No. 26 of that date. 11 /1 1 • 1 (See Proceedings, Political A., February 1870, retary of State what had been done in the No - 2o s)- matter, and requested that nothing might be finally decided as regards jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf without first allowing the Government of India an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon the proposals. 311. On the 7th of April 1869, Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran called See Proceedings, Political A., February 1870, upon Colonel Pelly, Political Resident Kos. 271.73. i n the Persian Gulf, to furnish him with a list of the British subjects residing within his districts, with the view of a possible granting of judicial powers to British authorities in Persia. 312.

His Grace promised to keep the subject in view. At the same time he asked if the Resident at Bushire had, in 1866, communicated his views on the subject to the Consul- General at Constantinople. 315. The Government of India replied that he had, and forwarded a copy No. .47, dated 2c,ti, July ,8 7 o, of Colonel Felly's letter of 3rd October 1866, Proceedings, Political a , July 1870 (No. 370. conveying his recommendations in the ^C/poiiMoauJj'iy'?^; No. 36,. ™ atter - ^Iso informed the Bombay Government that they had nothing more on record concerning the conferment of judicial powers on British officials in Persia than that Government possessed. 316.

The Secretary of State now forwarded a copy of a further correspondence with Despatch No. 67. dated 31st May 1871. the Foreign Office on the subject. On the Political a„ August 1871, Nos, S3*S4+ 3o'h December last, Sir Philip Francis asked directions from the Foreign Office upon one or two points which had arisen in regard to the preparation of the draft order. In the first place it seemed to him that there was no one in the Political or Consular Service on whom the duty of drawing up the rules of practice could be well imposed. These, he thought, should be based upon the Code of Rules in use in the Courts of the Ottoman Empire, which had, he said, on the whole been found to be a well-constructed system. He raised the question whether the Constantinople Court should be charged with the duty of drawing up the rules and modifying them from time to time, or whether the Persian Courts should be independent of the Supreme Consular Court of Constantinople. He submitted that there was no advantage in giving appeal from Courts constituted as the Persian Consular Courts must be to other courts,— such as that of the Minister of Tehran, who necessarily has no such special experience or aptitude in legal procedure as would offer any advantage in the administration of justice for him to decide, or revise cases in appeal. 317. He thought that it would be advantageous to constitute the Supreme Consular Court of Constantinople as a Court of appeal from Persia, as it was from Turkish and Egyptian Courts. He was in favor of giving to the Resident at Bushire and the Assistant Resident within his jurisdiction such commission as would empower them to hold Court as Consular Officers, and to have direct relation with the Supreme Consular Court as a Court of appeal, or, better still, with Bombay. 318. Earl Granville asked the Duke of Argyll whether he concurred with him in thinking that Sir P. Francis should be entrusted with the preparation of the rules for the proposed Consular Courts in Persia, and that the Persian Court should be independent of the Supreme Consular Court at Constantinople, except in cases of appeal, whilst the Court of appeal from Bushire should be at Bombay. The Secretary of State for India adhered to his former opinion that the rules should be drawn up by Sir P. Francis in communication with the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf. His Grace stated that Colonel Pelly was fully empower ed to represent Indian interests in the matter, and that, unless in the event of a diversity of opinion between Sir P. Francis and him, there did not appear to be any necessity for any reference to the India Office on the subject of the applica tion of the Act to Persia. 319. Earl Granville in reply intimated that Sir P. Francis would be instructed to place himself in communication with Colonel Pelly, with a view to a definite settlement of the question. It appeared to His Lordship to be necessary, in the first instance, to determine what orders in Council were required to confer jurisdic tion in territories on the Persian Gulf not belonging to Turkey or Maskat; and he suggested that Colonel Pelly's attention should be called to this point so far as relate to the Chiefs of islands or places not subject to Turkey, Persia, or Maskat, and that he should be directed to take steps, if necessary, to procure the requisite assent from the rulers of these territories. 320. In forwarding the papers here, the Duke of Argyll requested that D^atch NO. 67, dated 3.* Ma, ,87.. CoI 1 onel P 6 ''? ™g ht ^ instructed accord- mgly, and that he might be made acquainted with the purport of the correspondence. noreoo 321. The following were the instructions issued by the Foreign Office Persia to Sir P. Francis : •' The first point to be settled is the preparation of the orders in Council under which J the jurisdiction is to be exercised, and then the rules should be framed on the model of those for the Consular Courts in the Levant; but as these are now under revision, it will be far better to proceed, in the first instance, with the question of the orders in Council.'Lord Granville thinks it advisable that yon should render such assistance as may he in y ou ^with regard to the P^-.on of the^orders angles, ^olone, Pelly^dl we^that'ymiThouId 0 com'niun^cate with Sir H. Elliot with regard to the position taken by Her Majesty 's Government as to the sovereignty place claimed by the Porte and .t s only necessary for me to add t/iai appeals pom Courts m the I trstan Gulf should be to Bombay. ..••••* ' In framing any order on this subject, you will not fad to bear in mind the recital in the oreamble of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, in virtue of which any such order can alone belssued, viz.,—' Whereas by treaty, capitulat,on, grants, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means. Her Majesty hath power olaees out of Her Majesty's dominions; —and be satisfied that by one or other of such means Her Majesty hath power and jurisdiction in the country to wh.ch the order applies.' 123 On the Sth of June 1871 Colonel Pelly forwarded demi-officially an extract from a demi-official letter from Sir P. Francis to him on the above subject. Sir Phillip urged the advisability of Colonel Pelly proceeding in person to Constantinople to discuss the draft order. ' We can do more, he said, [014 days' personal communication than by three years' writing. He was of opinion that the matter should be devised and worked by Indian officers, and also that affairs in the Gulf should be under the Government of India, and not the Foreign Office. Q23. In a previous demi-official, dated 2nd May, Colonel Pelly alluded to the above letter of Sir Phillips. He pointed out how advisable It would be to have Gulf affairs under one authority. He said : ' Going on with undefined and mingled authority only leads to confusion, jealousies, and general injury.' He thought that the Government of India should be the controlling authority; but, in which ever way it was decided, he strongly urged the principle of unity of authority. Colonel Pelly's wishes in this matter had already been met by the decision of Her Majesty's Government that appeals from the Courts sitting under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman should lie to the Bombay High Court. 324. The Bombay Government were told to suspend any orders that might have been Issued on Secretary of State's No. ,808 -p, dated asth Augu.t ,871. despatch No. 67, dated 31st May 1871. The Bombay Government were also asked to inform the Government of India, before any further steps were taken in the matter of Consular jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf, (1) what was the actual practice at the time prevailing in the Gulf as regards jurisdiction in cases where British subjects were concerned; and (2) whether that practice had been found to be attended with any actual ill results. The letter of the Government of India proceeded to say :— ' His Excellency in Council also desires to be favoured with the opinion of the Hon'ble the Governor in Council and the Political authorities in the Gulf on the point, to what classes of Britsh subjects the jurisdiction of the Courts to be established under the scheme indicated in the Secretary of State's despatch should apply. It seems to His Excellency in Council that there are obvious reasons for refraining from seeking to try the crimes com mitted by, or adjudicate on the civil claims preferred by or against all, without exception, of that heterogenous body of men, who, from their parentage or residence in one or other of the many British possessions scattered over the world, can claim the rights of British subjects under circumstances which may render it extremely difficult to ascertain how far the claim is well founded. Unless, therefore, good ground be shown for doing otherwise, it would seem to the Governor-General in Council that if, on receipt of the report now called for, it be decided to push this matter further, the jurisdiction of the Courts to be es tablished should be confined to persons born of wholly British parentage.' 325. With their letter No 6137, dated 26th October 1872, the Bombay Gov ernment submitted Colonel Pelley's views on the general question of the settle ment of disputes between British subjects and proteges on the one hand, and Persian subjects. Colonel Pelly confessed that the time seemed fully arrived when, owing to the development of our commerce in those regions, and to the conse quent complication of interests, the Residency should acknowledge that, having no jurisdiction, it could not adjudicate; and that the safest and necessary course93 was to adhere strictly to the provisions of the Commercial Treaty with Persia. Along the Arabian littoral he thought it might still be possible to dispose of civil disputes amicably by personal influence, as provided for by the last instruc tions of the Government of India. As to the Persian littoral, where the requirements of British merchants had to be met, and where our official actions were liable to the supervision of the Persian Central Government, Colonel Pelly thought that we could no longer venture beyond the limits of treaty stipulation without incurring incon venient responsibility, and without perhaps in the long run impeding where it was hoped to advance the interests of commerce. Colonel Pelly remarked that British commercial interests in Persia were pro tected on the basis of the Commercial Treaty of Turkomanchai between Persia and Russia, the 7th Article of which provided for the investigation and settle ment of claims and disputes between Russians and Persian subjects; and that as all disputes between Russian and Persians were to be referred to the Courts of Religious Law or Equity, the only intervention allowed on the part of the Russian representative being that cases should be heard and decided in the presence of the Russian representative's interpreter, so all disputes between British and Persian subjects should be referred to the same Courts. To carry out the treaty stipulations and the wishes of the Government, and to relieve the Residency of an anxious and irregular responsibility, Colonel Pellv proposed for the future ' to be guided by the stipulations of the Commercial Treaty, thus abandoning the old and irregular practice of investigating at the Residency cases werein a Britisli subject or protege may be defendant, and of sending to the Courts Residency officials watch and note the proceedings of cases wherein British subjects or proteges may be parties to a suit. An interpreter would attend, but his functions would be simply those of an interpreter.' ^ He hoped thereby to be able to avoid further complications and irregu larities which under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act would be introduced, and Gov ernment could succeed in effecting a change in the Commercial Treaty. 326. In a further letter No. 6161, dated 28th October 1871, the Bombay Government submitted answers to the questions put by the Government of India in their letter No. 1808, dated 25th August 1871, and also a correspondence bet ween Colonel Pelly and Sir P. Francis on the question of Consular jurisdiction in Persia. The proposals of Sir P. Francis are contained in the following extract from his letter of 27th December 1870 to Colonel Pelly ' That Consular officers in Persia shall be invested with the power of hearing certain civil and criminal matters in which British and protected subjects are interested.' That the Resident (or by his appointment the Assistant Resident) at Bushire shall likewise hold a Court for the administration of justice, including maritime cases. 4 That the other Assistant Residents (and consular officers if any) should possess like authorities. r ' That there should be appeal in certain cases from the Assistant Resident (and con sular officers if any) in the district under your jurisdiction to the Resident. ' That in those cases the Court of final appeal should be Bombay. ' That the Consuls, Vice-Consuls not included in the above paragraph, viz., Tabrez and Reshd, should likewise have the same judicial powers and hold Courts of first instance. ,f That at Tehran a Court should be held either by the Minister (or by his deputation the Secretary of Legation, or Vice-Consul). ' That from the Courts of Tabrez, Reshd, and that held by the Minister's Deputy at Tehran, the appeal should lie to the Minister at Tehran or to the Supreme Consular Court at Constantinople, or to the Secretary of State (and I should be glad to have your opinion as to which would be the best of these suggested Courts of appeal). ' That assessors may occassionally (especially in cases when protected subjects are involved in the suit) be drawn from foreigners. ' That the place for prolonged imprisonment should be either at Malta or Bombay. But that Her Majesty's Government should send hereafter general directions on this head and in respect of the particular cases, special orders as to the carrying out sentences of long imprisonment.'' S640FD327. Colonel Pelly replied* concurring generally in the views of Sir P. Francis so far as they concerned his own jurisdiction * No. 240-.4S. dated..th March 187,. ^ ^ of his assistants on the p ers i an Coast. ' But,' he added, '* if the orders in Council limit its provisions to Persian territory, it would, in so far as the jurisdiction of this Residency is concerned, provide for only one littoral of the Persian Gulf, Whereas a large number and indeed the majority of cases arise along the Arab littoral. If possible, it would, I think, be very desirable that the order in Council should include all such regions as may be inciuded within the Resident's jurisdiction. ***«•***» ' Our interests in these regions being mainly British IifcPan, and bulk of British subjects here trading or residing being British Indian or connected with India, I am of opinion that the officials of this Residence should remain wholly subordinate to the Indian Government. ' Constituting this jurisdiction in part in subordination to the Foreign Office and in part insubordination to the Indian authorities would, I apprehend, irtad to confusion and delays, and occasionally even to conflict in instructions.' 328. Again in his letter to the Bombay Government of 14th December 1871 and the postscript thereto, Colonel Pelly remarks:— ' —That my charge is not wholly or principally in Persia ; and that what is required in respect to this residency is authority to treat civil and criminal matters which may have place at any point, whether Arabian or Persian, or Turkish, round the shore line of the Gulfs of Persia and and whether these matters may happen as between British subjects, or, as they far more frequently do happen, between a British subject as native.

This, however, is a subject on which I had particu larly desired to communicate orally with higher authority in India.' 329. With reference to the classes of persons who should be brought within the consular jurisdiction, which was one of the principal questions raised by the Government of India in their letter No. 1808, dated 25th August, the following are Colonel Felly's views (his letter No. 1438-384, dated 4th September 1872) ' I would respectfully submit that the letter No. 1808 almost seems to answer its own question, as it concludes with the following words, that unless good ground be shown for doing otherwise * * * * * , the jurisdiction of the Courts to be estab- lished should be confined to persons born wholly of British parentage. ' However, I would now venture to submit that the jurisdiction of the Courts should, in my opinion, exclude all matters, whether civil or criminal, in which persons born of foreign parentage are concerned as defendants: in other words, the mere accident of a person of foreign parentage having been born within British India or other British territory, or the fact of a person of foreign parentage having received letters of Consular protection should not eiiiitle that person to the jurisdiction of the Court. But person born wholly of British parentage (strictly so understood), and also person bond fide born of British Indian parentage should, I think, be included in the jurisdiction of the Court. 1 think also that on grounds of policy and equity, those persons who, although foreigners by parentage, received British protection prior to our Treaty with Persia of 1857, should also' be included in the jurisdiction of the Court. This class is not numerous and is insusceptible of being added to under our present Treaty relations. ' But it appears to me that whatever may be enacted on this matter, it would be ' Vide page 16 of the Preface to 2nd Edition advisable to avail ourselves of past experience. tfLTLTJ^Z% C :'- en ' a ' eS °'' a&gt;er - Clauses which clear and equitable, some- 'The immiscible characters of Christian and times lai1 ^ the working.

What in Persia i, rgued that this Subject IS Itrelcvent to is far more urgently required than a Consular one un der discussion.

Practice indeed t referred b y British against Persian sub- in some instances shows the two questions to be curiously and perplexingly intermixed. ( Jurisdiction of the character contemplated in the Government Resolution is doubtless desirable, with time must become increasingly so. But some arrangement under which British subjects cwd proteges^ maybe enabled with confidence to prosecute their claims against Persian subjects is, in my opinion, essential to the developement of trade and to the interests of our subjects. ' Understand that m Turkey this necessity is provided for by a sort of mixed Mer cantile Board, and I think that if I or any other officer be ordered to Constantinople, this subject should form a part of the discussions to be carried on between Sir Philip Francis and myself or the officer deputed/' r ! 330. Lastly, as regards the authority for the application of the Foreign Juris diction Act to the territories of the Chiefs and tribes on the Arab Coast, whom we hold to be independent both of Persia and Turkey, Colonel Pelly reported Rasool Khymah. Ejman. ' As at present informed, I beg most res- Oniuf Gowain.

The Bombay Government in sending up these papers replied to the three questions put by the Government of India:— Question, —What is the actual practice To No. i. Answer. —When British subjects at present prevailing in the Gulf as regards are concerned as defendants the following is jurisdiction in cases where British subjects the course of proceedings:— are concerned ? ' In Maskat they are dealt with under the Consular jurisdiction enjoyed by the Politi cal Agent under the High Court of Bombay, Those in Turkish territory come under the jurisdiction of the Vice-Consul at Busreh. ' Those in Arab Coast States have not required the exercis^ of criminal jurisdiction. ' Those in the Persian ports have been dealt with by the Political Resident and his Assistants, both in criminal and civil cases, in the exercise of an irregular jurisdiction, for which there is no proper authority, and which might at any time be called' ih question by the parties affected.''9 6 Question —Whether that practice has To No. II. Answer.—No actual ill results been found to be attended with any ill up to this time ; but looking to the changing r ^ su j t p conditions of society in those regions, it would not be prudent to delay placing matters on a sounder basis. Question.—To what classes of British To No. III. Answer.—The Bombay Gov- subjects tha jurisdiction of the Courts to be eminent question the expediency of limiting established should apply ? the jurisdiction ' to persons born of wholly British parentage. ' They say:— 'Such a restriction might easily deprive a bond fide British subject of the protection to which he had a fair claim. It may fairly be urged that the very fact of the existence of what is termed the ' heterogenous body of men' spread over the globe as British subjects, affords strong ground for rendering the contemplated order in Council truly comprehensive and efficient. We have now in Australia, Canada, the Cape, and New Zealand, great and increasing communities of undeniable British subjects, Germans and other foreigners are establishing themselves there and in India in large numbers, and will undoubtedly inter marry with the resident population. It is hard to discover any sound reason for depriving the son of a British father and Foreign mother of the protection of the Court, and His Excellency is inclined to believe that the extension of the jurisdiction of the Court to all British subjects would not in practice be found to be so inconvenient as seems to be apprehended. The Court might be invested with power to determine the status, for its own purposes, of any one claiming to be a British subject. It might be a rule that whenever a question on that point was raised, it should be determined before entering upon the suit, and that the determination should be final. The number of British subjects of importance taking up their residence in Persian and Arabian towns must be limited. Their arrival would generally be known to the British authorities, and it would not be difficult for the Court by rule to fix and declare the nature of the proofs, documentary and others, of British origin, which they would require in support of a claim to the protection of the Court.' With reference to the Secretary of State's despatch (in which the Secretary ^ , w „ of State desired that Colonel Pelly should o. 7, ate 31st ay 1 71. } ns t ruc ted to take steps, if necessary, to procure the requisite assent from the rulers of territories in the Persian Gulf not subject to Turkey, Persia, or Maskat), the Bombay Governraent stated that it would not be necessary to obtain the assent of these rulers, as by usage and sufferance the British Government had long exercised and did exercise jurisdic tion over British subjects in contemplation. The Bombay Government thought the time had arrived for Colonel Pelly to proceed to Constantinople and discuss with Sir P. Francis the best mode of dealing with cases in which British subjects might be plaintiffs, and Persian defendants, a matter to which he attaches much importance. Political A.

In the discussion of this question, care must be taken to distingnish between the legal position of the British Government in relation to Foreign Powers and its position in respect to its own subjects: points which though quite distinct are nevertheless easily confounded. 3. It would seem scarcely necessary for us to observe that the Foreign Jurisdiction Act cannot confer any jurisdiction as against the Government of a foreign country. It is intended solely ts bind those over whom the Foreign Government allows British jurisdic- exerc i se( ^• The Act assumes that the jurisdiction has been granted, and is addressed to remove^doubts as to how far such jurisdiction is controlled by English law. This is done by sections i and 2. By the four next sections the Act confers some useful97 evidence and ca ^ in ^ accused P er -ns and convicts from one place to another; but hese are exceptional and comparatively unimportant operations affecting Foreign Go^Zl^ ^ 33 We ' ' th0Se W ' thi '' the junsaiction^onfer/edlr the .nH a 4 ' •f r0b ^V W0 i firStS J eCti0nS0f the A ct are only declaratory of the law as it was and as it would have been decided had it come before a British Court of Justice R,,f fuS h „ at T t ay be ' that Act takes effert whenever the Crown Acquires ] sdiction. It gives the Crown absolute power to the extent of the iurisdiction so acquired, and directs all British authorities to conform themselves accordingly. 5- Over and above the direct operation of the Act, the Crown may, by virtue of the ct, appoint persons to exercise the powers conferred bv sections 3 to 6 ; it may by virtue of its general prerogative erect Courts for the exercise of the permitted jurisdiction and may, by virtue of its prerogative as expressly recognised in the Act, declare the law which is to be administered by its own Courts. ' aeciare the law 6. The position of affairs between the British and Persian Governments anDears to be as follovvs ;—^or a considerable number of years, apparentlv extending baek to the time when the Arab Chiefs were Governors of Bushire the British Resident at that place has exercised civil and criminal juHs , ' le ? a f. extcnt °f the criminal jurisdiction does not appear to be -very clearly defined itd I ]' r ' sdtct&gt;on seems to embrace (a) all cases between British subjects and protected persons {who may be called Brit (b) same classes of persons are defendants ; (c) all cases between those classes and others [no) being Persian subjects) provided the parties consent ; and (d) if a Persian subject is defendant, and a British subject plaintiff, the case is tried m the Persian Courts but a Residency official may be deputed to watch the proceedings. ' ., 7 ' that the jurisdiction thus exercised is wider than what is authorized by the Treaty of Pans, aud that so much of it as is not covered by the Treaty s that^T ft Tp ' dtS . C A ont T ed ' The argUmenfc u P on which this view is based is that the Treaty of Pans provides that on the establishment and recognition of Consuls- General, Vice-Consuls, and Consular Agents, and in the treatment of their respective subjects and their trade, each contracting party shall be placed on the footing of the most favoured nation ; that Russia is the most favoured nation, and that the Rusians have no general power of entertaining civil suits in which Russian subjects are the defendants But this view appears to us to be erroneous. The fact that the British Government haB exercised larger powers of jurisdiction than the Russians only proves that not Russia but Great Britain is the most lavoured nation in this respect. There is nothing in the Treaty of Pans which says that the British shall not be the most favoured nation. If the privileges enjoyed by England were less than those accorded to Russia by the Treaty of Turcoman- cha.!, the T. reaty of Pans would enlarge them. But if they were already greater that Treaty does not contract them. We are, therefore, of opinion that what Colonel Pelly /W th yJ d and / rre Z ul '\Pr act * ce 'which has been carried on for many years with the knowledge and consent of the Persian Government is perfectly legal, and ought to be continued till altered by Order in Council, 8. As regards Muscat the Treaty of July 1840 says nothing about crimimal jurisdic- tion except m one isolated case dealt with by Article IV. We assume, however, that the Order in Cound 1 * of the^th November 1867 is in accordance with criminal jurisdiction conferred by usage or sufferance. This Order assumes that the Crown possesses complete criminal jurisdiction over British subjects, and it gives power to the Consul and the High Court of Bombay to exercise that jurisdiction, each in his allotted province. As regards civil jurisdiction none is mentioned in the Order except in suits between British subjects, whereas the Treaty of_i84o distinctly provides for nearly the same amount of civil jurisdic tion as exists in Persia. The jurisdiction in Muscat is somewhat larger in one resnect nnHon / f J f &gt; Britl t h is , P laintiff ' and the subject of another Christian nation defendant, the suit may be tried by the British authorities, without any consent of othe^Than^Muscat again ^ ^ COntraCted in res P ect of the subjects of Muhamaden powers c relations oi the Br » t ish Government with the various independent potentates ot the Gulf are of the same character as those .with Persia ; at all events the British Oovernment does not exercise a less amount of jurisdiction in their dominions than in those of Persia. 10. There remains only to be considered the question of jurisdiction in the Turkish possessions bordering on the Gulf, There exists already throughout Turkey an establish ed system of Consular jurisdiction under the control of Her Majesty's Ambasador at Constantinople, with which it may not perhaps be possible to interfere. If the existing arrangements regarding Turkey do not admit of modification, then Colonel Pelly's advice to establish a single jurisdiction for the whole water and littoral of the Persian and Oman Gulfs must, so far as regards Turkey, be negatived. Otherwise the advice seems to us very sound, and of considerable importance to the working of the system, S640FD98 11. On this state of facts then we think Colonel Pelly may be advised, that the draft Order to be framed by himself and by Sir P. Francis should be carefully expressed so as no to assume more jurisdiction than is now permitted by the various Foreign Powers ; that it should go to the full undoubted extent of that jurisdiction; that the order in Council for Muscat maybe taken as a general guide for the new order; that as regards criminal cases it may be closely followed to the extent to which our position admits : that as regards civil cases the jurisdiction assumed in that order is narrower than is the jurisdiction in Persia and other places, and the new order must be modified accordingly as to those places ; and that the new order should also expressly modify the Muscat Order in the same way. On the local extent of the order we consider Colonel Pelly right in trying to embarace into one system the territory he mentions, with exception of the Turkish territory, for the reason already given ; and it would, in our opinion, be advis able to include Muscat and to modify the Muscat Order accordingly. In fact the better plan would be to repeal the Muscat Order entirely. 12. With respect to the important question of the law to be administered, we are of opinion that the same reasons which led to the choice of the Bombay High Court as a Court of Appeal, and now the additional face that such a choice has been made, point to the law of British India as that which should govern all civil cases. The Vuscat Order is silent as to the civil law, so it must be taken that English law prevails there ^ and the Order will have to be modified again in this respect if Muscat is brought into the arrangement. In speaking of civil' law we do not mean to include procedure which should be regulated by the principal Judge. 13. It is, however, possible that the introduction of Indian CriminaJ Law would be unsuitable to the circumstances of the community among whom the law is to work. The Muscat Order gives to the Consul a general power of making regulations for the peace, order, and good government of Her Majesty's subjects ; of enforcing them by fine, imprison ment,'and banishment ; and as to other offences not covered by any regulations it gives similar powers. He also has power to commit to Bombay for trial. But as to offences not covered by regulations nothing is to be deemed an offence which would not be so deemed by ' a Court of Justice having criminal jurisdiction in Her Majesty's dominions, ' which we think must be taken to mean an English Court of Justice. We are, therefore, of opinion, as at present advised, that the better plan would be to follow the Muscat order in giving the principal Judge (who would probably be the Resident or Consul- General of Bushire) power to make regulations and to provide that, except so far as it may be displaced by Regulation, the Indian Penal Code shall prevail. But the subject is one that must be carefully considered, and on which Colonel Pelly's own opinion will be most important. 14. The third point for consideration is with regard to the extent of personal juris diction to be exercised under the new arrangements, that is to say, whether the jurisdic tion of the Court to be established shall be confined to persons bom of wholly British parentage, or shall be extended to British subjects generally. If this question were now under consideration for the fust time we should be disposed to confine the jurisdic tion to certain classes, such as all persons of European extraction, all domiciled in the United Kingdom, and all who are entitled to British protection, such as ^ persons in the service of Government or serving on board British ships. But considering that the jurisdiction has hitherto extended to all British subjects, and that the Muscat Order, now five vears old, so deals with it, and that no practical mischief has yet been found, we think that there is hardly any case for restricting the personal jurisdiction, even though it is likely henceforth to affect much larger numbers. But we think that the Judges should have a discretion to remit cases to the Courts of the country, when they consider the justice can so be better done. 15. Connected with this point is one which will require attention. Besides British subjects, our jurisdiction has extended to a number of persons whom we have here called British clients, persons recognized as entitled to our protection^ and who appear, in Bushire at least, to be known and registered as such. By the Treaty of Paris (Article XII) we renounce the right of protecting hereafter any Persian subject, not actually in the employment of certain specified officers, provided that no such right is accorded to or exercised by any Foreign Powers : but we are to have as much privilege as the most favoured nation. In defining the classes over which jurisdiction is to be exercised care must be taken not to infringe upon this stipulation. 16. As regards the nature of the Courts to be constituted, we are of opinion that much discretion must be left to Colonel Pelly to determine this in cornmunication with Sir P. Francis. But we would guggest that the arrangement regarding the Persian shores be kept quite distinct from those for the interior of Persia. The latter must be under the Minister at Tehran and the English Foreign Office. The former should be under Colonel Pelly and the Government of India. It will, we think, be safer and less likely to give rise to misunderstanding to give Colonel Pelly the designation of Consul-General or Consul, and his subordinates the designation of Consuls or Vice-Consuls, in addition to the titles of Resident, or Assistant Resident, or Political Agent, as the case may beAppeals from subordinates in the Gulf should be first to the Resident or Consul-General and then to Bombay. Appeals from Gwadur should, as in th« case of Muscat, be to Bombay direct. Ihe general executive control should be with the Government of India, and in this respect we consider that the Muscat Order should be modified. Should a Consul-General be appointed as a Court of Appeal, it is a question for consideration whet er tie limits placed by the Muscat Order on the power of fine and imprisonment may not be properly enlarged. 17. In paragraph 2 of Your Graces despatch No. 67-C., dated May 1871, we were instructed to take steps if necessary for procuring from the Rulers of those islands or places in the Persian Gulf, not subject to Turkey, Persia, or Muscat, their assent to the exercise of jurisdiction within their territories. We have not, however, considered it necessary to take any definite action in this matter. Your Grace is aware that the pre tensions of Turkey on the Coast of the Persian Gulf are of the most indefinite kind, and that to all the territory which she claims Persia puts forward equal pretensions. The Muscat boundary is indefinite, and has generally contracted or expanded with the strength or weakness ol the VVahabee power at Riadh. IVe consider it most undesirable to raise any question as to what belongs to Turkey, what to Persia, ichat to Maskat, and what to none of these Powers, nor in our opinion is any such definition of the territory which is Independent Turkey, Persia, and Maskat at all requisite for the purpose of our jurisdiction, which) as a matter of fact) is and has long been exercised within the terri tories of the minor Chiefs, whether claimed by the three greater Powers or not. As our jurisdiction already exists and is justified by long usage and sufferance, it appears to us unnecessary to obtain any formal consent from the Chiefs, and inexpedient to cast any doubt upon the validity of our jurisdiction by applying for such consent. 18. As intimately connected with the subject of Consular jurisdiction in Persia and the Persian Gulf, we would invite Your Grace's attention to our despatch No. 7, dated 10th instant, relating to the proposed modification of the Commercial Treaty with Persia, We also solicit consideration of our despatch No. 20 of this date, regarding a proposal put forward by Colonal Pelly for the establishment of a tribunal for the adjudication of cases in which British subjects are plaintiffs and Persian subjects defendants.* 333* There was then a protracted correspondence on the several points noted above. The question of concluding a Commercial Treaty with Persia would, it was apprehended, take too long a time to make it convenient to wait before passing an Order in Council. Accordingly a draft order was prepared by Mr. Reilly applying the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to the Persian Coast and Islands and was forwarded by the Secretary of State to the Government of India. The Bombay High Court and the Political Resident in the Gulf were consulted on the subject. Upon consideration of their replies the Government of India were inclined to propose considerable changes on the draft order which seemed to them in some respects unnecessarily elaborate, having regard to the judicial work devolv ing on British Courts on the Gulf. In the meanwhile the Government of India were informed that their recommendations on the draft Order in Council for Zanzi bar were urgently required. The accordingly submitted a revised draft order with certain observations in their despatch No. 2, dated 28th August 1882. They thought that in the case of Zanzibar Order in Council it would be sufficient to commence by extending only those enactments which were obviously necessary for the administration of the simplest system of civil and criminal justice. In regard to the Persian Gulf, it was thought advisable to await an expression of views of His Majesty's Government on the despatch referred to above before applying the same considerations to places where our position was much less definable. 334. The Zanzibar order was passed in December 1884, and shortly after wards the Government of India were informed by the Secretary of State that Her Majesty's Government left it to our discretion to proceed in the matter of the draft order for the Persian Coast and Islands in the Persian Gulf. A draft order was then prepared by the Government of India more or less on the lines of * The practice at this time ts explained in the following paragraph in the Gulf Administration Report for&lt;i873- 74. 'The local civil suits and complaints of various sorts which are brought to the British Residency at Bushire are numerous. When possible these are disposed of on Lhe spot, but when that is not practicable, and when Persian officials hold different views from the Resident, appeal has to be made to the capital and, when necessary, the support of Her Majesty's Mi nister is solicited. A case of some importance with regard to shipping interests occurred at Eushire during the year under review. A British steamer was found to be on fire on the roads and had to discharge her cargo&gt; most of which was for Basra. The Governor of Bushire preferred a claim first for one- third of the « hole cargo as salvage. Secondly, for customs duty on all the cargo landed temporary for safety and subsequently re-shipped.

The application of the Order, as drafted, would be strictly limited to the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf which belong to Persia, The coast belonging to Turkey and Maskat have been regulated by separate orders; and the coast belonging to Arab Chiefs, with the Island of Bahrein, can, if necesary, be dealt with when the present draft has been settled, (xliii) Consular Powers for the Resident in Persian Gulf, 1878. 335.

Thompson sent to Colonel Ross the Queen's Commission appointing him to be Her Majesty's Consul-General for the Pro vince of Fars and the coasts and Islands of the Persian Gulf within the dominions of Persia together with Exalquator issued by the Shah to enable him to act in that capacity, and a firman to the Prince Governor of Fars, translation of which is given below Translated purport of a firman jrom His Majesty the Shah to H. R. H. the Prince Moetemid-ud-Dowleh, Cover nor-General of FarSj Shir as ) dated Rubee-ul-awal, I2g6. As the British Mission have officially informed me through the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Charles Ross has been appointed by the British Government Consul-General in Fars in the Coasts and Islands of the Persian Gulf which are a part of the dominions of Persia. For the perfect friendship existing between the two exalted Governments, we issue this nrman, and order that our uncle, His Royal Highness the Prince Forhad Mirza Moetemid-ul-Dowleh, Firman Firma of the Province of Fars, should recognize the above mentioned high place as Consul-General, and your Royal Highness should show him distinction like unto the representatives of other perfectly friendly powers, and in giving and receiving rights and you should act according to the Treaty existing between the two friendly powers, and keep in the most friendly terms. Let this be well understood by your Royal Highness. 336. The following is the notification dated 28th November 1878:— 'The Queen has been graciously pleased to appoint Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Charles Ross to be Her Majesty's Consul-General for the Province of Fars and the coast and islands of the Persian Gulf being within the dominions of Persia.' (xlvi) Judicial powers conferred on the Political Officers in the Gulf, 1873-1881. 337. By Government of India Notification No. 1275-P., dated 13th June Secret, June 1873, Nos 318-347. ^ /3; the undermentioned officers were . appointed Justices of the Peace under the Foreign Jurisdiction Extradition Act of 1872 for the territories opposite their designation:— (1) The Commissioner in Sind—for the territories of the Khan of Kalat and possessions of the Sultan of Maskat in Baluchistan. (2) The Political Agent, Kalat—for the territories of the Khan of Kalat. (3) The Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur—for the territories of the Sultan of Maskat in Baluchistan. (4) The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf—for the coast line from Gwadur westward of the Persian Gulf, all the shores of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, with the Islands in these Gulfs and the territories of the Sultan of Maskat in Arabia.IOI The same notification mentioned the Bombay High Court as the Court to which the Justice of the Peace could commit for trial. (( 338- We may mention that under section 6 of the Extradition Act, i872&gt; every such Justice of the Peace shall have powers conferred on magistrates o^ the first class, who are justices of the peace and European British subjects, by any law for the time being in force in British India relating to criminal procedure. 339. By notification No. 452 -P., dated 1st March 1877, the Government Political a., March 1877, Nos. 1 -12. of India appointed the officer for the time D .. . . r being holding the office of Assistant Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, being a European British subject, to be a Justice of the Peace and to exercise also the powers of a magistrate of the 1st class, within the whole coast and islands of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, with the exception of those portions which are under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Maskat and the Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur. 340. We have seen that Foreign Department Notification No. 1275-?.,* Political A., September 1877, Nos. 285-286. dated 13th June ' ^73&gt; appointed the ♦Secret Proceedings. June 1873, No. 336 (Nos.

And the same notification named the Bombay High Court as the Court to which he should commit for trial. 341. Subsequently the Resident was informed by Foreign Department No. » Political A., October, 1873, N s. 389-392. 2508 -P.,* dated 20th October 1873, that the notification above cited did not authorize him to exercise jurisdiction over Ei^opcdn British subject) because the Government of India had no power to legislate for such persons residing in the territories included in the Persian Gulf Residency. The Resident's jurisdiction could only rest upon usage or upon express authority given by an* Order in Council under the English Foreign Jurisdiction Act. 342. Again, in March 1877, the Resident was told (Foreign Department No. 673 -P., dated 26th March 1877) that the latter part of Section 6, Act XI of 1872, did not authorize him to commit Native British subjects to the Bombay High Court for trial. 343- Erom these two rulings Colonel Prideaux argues In his letter No. 166, dated 28th June 1877, ^at the notification of June 1873 has no bearing at all upon the legal position of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, for it does not empower him to deal with Europeans in any w r ay or to commit natives for trial. 344. To remove all doubts the following notification was published :— No. 2161-P., dated Simla, 7tli September 1877. NOTIFICATION —By Government of India, Foreign Department. Whereas by Treaty, Capitulation, Agreement, Grant, Usage, Sufferance, and other lawful means, the Governor-General of India in Council has, in the countries or places hereinafter in that behalf mentioned, power and jurisdiction to administer justice among and over Indian British subjects, and for that purpose to make the appointments herein after appearing:— In exercise of the powers conferred by sections 4 and 5 of the Foreign Jurisdiction and Extradiction Act, 1872 (Act XI of 1872), the Governor-General of India in Council hereby delegates to the officer holding, for the time being, the office of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf the powers and jurisdiction of a Magistrate of the 1st class as des cribed in the Code of Criminal Procedure (Acts X of 1872 and XI of 1874), to be exercised over Native Indian subjects of Her Majesty according to the procedure prescribed by the said Code, within the undermentioned territories beyond the limits of British India in which the said officer is accredited as the representative of the British Government: that is to say, the coast line from Gwadur westward to the Persian Gulf, all the shores of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, with the islands situated in these Gulfs, and the territories of the Sultan of Muscat in Arabia. In exercise of the aforesaid powers, the Governor-General in Council is further pleased to delegate to the said Political Resident in the Persian Gulf the powers and jurisdiction of S640FD102 a Sessions Judge, as described in the abovementioned Code of Criminal Procedure, to be exercised over Native Indian subjects of Her Majestyj within the aforesaid terntonesj according to the procedure prescribed by the said Code. 345- Political A., June 188 By notificatton No. 1927.C. P., dated 7th May 1880, Mr. B. Ffinch, Deputy Director of Telegraphs in the Persian Gulf, was made a Justice of the Peace under Act XXI of 1879 for the coast of the Mekran. The Governor- General in Council at the same time directed that the High Court of Bombay should be the Court to which the justice of the Peace should commit cases for trial. 346. Difficulties also arose in connection with the exercise of powers under the notification of 1877 (paragraph 344 Political a., October 1881, Noi. 274-87. above), A native Indian committed the offence of selling a slave on Shargaand afterwards went to Bombay. The Resi dent wanted to try him at Bushire as a senior Judge. But the point \\as raised whether he could try a case in that capacity, which had not been committed to him bv a first class Magistrate. To remove doubts on this point notification No. 2402-E. P., dated 6th October i88/,was published concering the powers of a magistrate'of the first class on the Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf and^of a Sessions Judge on the Resident in respect of offences committed by Native Indian subjects on any part of the coast line within the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Under this notification the Governor-General in Council was placed in the position of a High Court in regard to orders and sentences passed by the Resident. (xlv). The case of Marwareed, the converted Muhammadan at Kerman. Question of the authority of the Resident in the Persian Gulf to sentence him to im prisonment in the Bombay Jail, 1876. 347. The leading features of this case which was the cause of a somewhat lengthy correspondence are as follows In the spring of 1873 the Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Ross) reported to Her Majesty's Minister Political A., June 1877, No. 109-71. at Tehran (Mr Thomson) that a British Hindu merchant, named Moolchund, residing at Bandar Abbas in the Persian Gulf, had complained that his partner, another British Indian trader, named Marwareed, residing at Kerman, had turned Muhammadan with the intention of defrauding him by appropriating a large Moolchund. sum o £ money, being the value of goods which had been entrusted to him* for sale by a British Hindu merchant at Shikarpur. 348. Mr. Thomson brought the matter to the notice of the Persian Govern ment, on which the Governor of Kerman was ordered to investigate and settle , . 1. the claims agjaint Marwareed,f who, how- + He wa, by this time l™™ as • Ah Akber. ^ ^ by ^ officials&gt; and exciting the sympathies of his new co-religionists, managed to evade the attempts made to bring him to justice. 349. Fresh applications were made by the injured parties to Mr. Thomson, renewed representations were made by him to the Persian Government, further instructions were sent to the Governor of Kerman, but no satisfactory result was obtained. 350. A mixed meeting of Muhammadan and Hindu merchants was subse quently held at Kerman, when a decision signed by Muhammadans only was given to the effect that Marwareed was liable for a small portion of the claim against him. About the month of August 1875 one of Moolchund'sJ partners presented himself in person before Mr. Thomson, { The man defrauded by Marwareed. ^ begged ^ ^ ^ defaulter to be sent to Bandar Abbas in view to the accounts of the firm being personally examined and settled. On this Mr. Thomson again addressed the __ \103 Persian Government, the result being that the Governor of Kerman was directed to send Marwareed to Bandar Abbas to undergo an examination of his accounts at a meeting to be held by Hindu residents and others with the knowledge of the Persian Agent for Foreign Affairs, the case to be then brought to a final settlement and reported to the Persian Government. * Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign 35 2 ' At this Stage the Case Was report- Affalrs ■ ed by Mr. Thomson to Earl Derby* with t See Political a ., April 1876, No. 95. the following remarksf:— ' If Marwareed was a Persian subject, this mode of procedure would seem to be per fectly regular. But he is a British subject accused of defrauding other British subjects. According to the yth Article of the Commercial Treaty of Turkomanchai between Russia and Persia and to the Treaty of Paris between England and Persia, which latter confers on us the privileges of the most favoured nation, the investigation and settlement of a case of this nature would be entirely confined to the Representative or Consul of Her Majesty the Queen and decided according to British law. u But Her Majesty's Minister and Consuls in Persia are not invested with judicial power; and if the exercise of such power by Persian authorities over British subjects were once recognized, it might later be cited as a precedent, if not interpreted, as a surrender by us of an important Treaty right. 'It struck me that the Resident at Bushire might possibly be invested with judicial powers by the Government of India, in which case I should have called upon the Persian Government to send Marwareed to Bandar Abbas to be there tried by the Resident or his representative. I accordingly asked Colonel Ross by telegraph whether he possessed the requisite legal authority: but he sent me the reply, ' I have not legally jurisdiction/ ' I now feel convinced that any further investigation of this case by the local author ities of Kerman would be unadvisable, and that my best course would be to suspend further action in the matter pending the receipt of Vour Lordship's instructions. I shall, therefore, inform the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that it is my intention to withhold his letter to the Governor of Kerman until I receive Your Lordship's instructions.' 353. The declaration by Mr. Thomson and Colonel Ross of their want of jurisdiction in the matter led, as will be seen by the notes in the case, to an im portant discussion in the Foreign Department, the result of which was embodied in the following letters to the Mr. Thomson and Colonel Ross :— I No. 538-? , dated 23rd February 1876. To the former it Was Said{ ' The Government of India dissents from the statement telegraphed to you by the „ . , . . Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that he o itica pn 1 7 , 0,100. no ^ 1 egally jurisdiction' to adjudicate upon cases between British subjects on the seaboard of the Persian Gulf. The Governor- General in Council maintains, on the contrary, that the Political Resident has such juris diction, based on usage and prescription. If therefore Your Excellency considers it expe dient to adopt the course indicated in your letter to the Earl of Derby, namely, to call upon ' the Persian Government to send Marwareed to Bandar Abbas to be there tried by the Resident or his representative, His Excellency in Council is not aware of any reason w r hy this should not be done; and in the event of your adopting this course. Colonel Ross has been instructed to proceed himself, or to depute one of his Assistants to Bandar Abbas for the purpose of trying the case in question. ' In the opinion of His Excellency in Council it is of importance that the Persian Government should not be led by silence on our part, to suppose that we could entertain their proposal that a case between British subject should be investigated by Persian author ities within the limits of a jurisdiction claimed by the Government of India.' § No, S37 -P, toed 23 rd February .876.

Mr. Taylor Thomson has been informed that if he considers it expedient to adopt the course indicated in that letter, namely, to call ' upon the Persian Government to send Marwareed to Bandar Abbas to be there tried by the Resident or his representative/ there is no reaon why this should not be done. Should this course be adopted by Mr. Thomson, you will either proceed yourself, or depute one of your Assistants, to Bander Abbass to try the case in question.' \.104 * No. 46, datef' ajth February 1876, Political The papers were also reported to the A., April 1876, No. ioi . Secretary of State.* 354. Before acting on the orders of the Government of India, Mr. Thomson referred the case to Her Majesty's Government for instructions. In a letter to His Excellency the Viceroy, dated the 6th of June 1876, he explained that he had deemed it prudent to take this course, because a doubt had arisen in his mind as to the legal competency of the British Government to adjudicate in such cases, not with reference to the right of jurisdiction enjoyed by it under the 7th Article of the Treaty of Turkomanchai, but as regarded the respon sibility which would be incurred by a British official in giving a decision, the legality of which might be disputed in an English Court of Law. 355- The Earl of Derby referred the points raised by Mr. Thomson to the Marquis of Salisbury, who, in reply, expressed a hope that Lord Derby would ' agree with him in thinking that there is nothing in the circumstances of this particular case which renders it necessary to discuss at present the perfectly general ques tion raised by Mr. Thomson as to the responsibility which would be incurred bv a British official in Persia, in the event of his adjudicating in a case between British subjects and the validity of his award being disputed in the English Court of Law by the party to whom the decision was adverse. *! As Lord Derb y 58 aware, arrangements for placing on a sound basis the jurisdiction of British officers in Persia are under consideration ; but some time is still likely to elapse before they will be completed, and Lord Salisbury thinks it undesirable that, so far at any rate as the Resident at Bushire is concerned any change should in the meantime be made m the procedure which has been followed for many years with the assent of the Persian Government, and without objection on the part of persons interested' Accordingly Mr. Thomson was instructed by Earl Derby to make arrange- t Telegram, dated ssth July 1876,^001 Earl ments for sending the case to Bandar Derby to Mr. Thomson Enclosure 3 of despatch AKKac fr.r u r&gt; i-.- 1 to Secretary of State, No. 4, dated 19th January . . adj UGlcatlOn by the Political ,8 77* Resident in accordance with usage.f . 356.

On the Gholam representing his mabihty and insisting that it should be settled at Kerman, both the M uiteh d and the Governor stated that the sympathy felt by the Muhammadan communify at Kerman for the defaulter would cause another disturbance if any attempt at re moving him was made. The failure of the Governor to deal promptly with the 'very different ca'u^e 00 xif t0 Band J ar l , A bbas was attributed b P y J Hindus to tS k f u They asserted that he had received money from Marwareed which he was loath to part with, and that whilst he was assuming an anxiety to carry out the orders sent him from Tehran, he was in reality sidhig with th Mujtehid. Seeing that nothmg could be done, Mr. Edwards returned to Bushir!105 having warned Marwareed's partners to be ready to proceed to Bushire with their books, witnessess, etc., etc., should they be sent for. Colonel Prideaux for his part reported the occurrences to Mr. Thomson, who demanded the immediate des patch of the defaulter for trial and the adoption of measures to assure the safety of the Hindoo at Kerman. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs thereupon wrote an order to the Governor of Kerman, which is well worthy of attention as • Enclosure No. 3 of Mr. Thomson's letter to ^ distinctly allows the Resident's right to Earl Derby, No. 162, dated 3rd November 1876. deal with the case. The Minister* said: ' The British Legation has a distinct right to force and urge upon its subjects to do t Marwareed's. justice. Under such circumstances why should hisf removal to Bandar Abbass be every day put off and the affair become difficult, and in the end give rise to serious trouble ? ' Ali Beg, an employe of this Department, has been despatched to take Mirza All t Marwareed. Akbar| without any further delay or excuse to Bandar Abbas, in order to settle his affairs with his creditors through the officer appointed by the British Resident' 359. In communicating the foregoing particulars to Earl Derby, Mr. Thom son made the following remarks which are also deserving of notice ' It was arranged that a special Agent or Mohussil with another Mission Gholam should be despatched to Kerman to see that the previous orders were enforced ; but I found that great delay took place here in giving effect to this arrangement in consequence not of any attempt to question our distinct right in the matter, but^ as I believe, because the Shah and his Minister are anxious to favor Marwareed as much as possible on account of his being a convert to Muhammadanism, and in order to give by such delay an opportunity for a compromise oj the disputed claims being effected at Kerman, the Mujtehid having opened a subscription there with a view to raise funds for Marwareed with this object. In my official communications with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, verbal and written, urging upon him immediate action in the matter, I informed the Persian Government that no settlement of the case could take place at Kerman, and that the parties must be sent to Bandar Abbas in order that the case should be adjudicated by the Resident either there or at Bushire.' 360. The order of the Minister for Foreign Affairs quoted above proved successful. On the 20th of November the Governor of Kerman started Mar- j Mr-Thomson to Etri Derby, No. 174, dated wareed on his journey to Bandar Abbas.§ a8th November 1875. ^ On the 6th of January Colonel Prideaux reported that the defaulter with three Hindu witnesses had arrived at Bushire, and that an investigation into the claims against him would be opened immedi ately. In his telegram of the 20th instant Colonel Prideaux asked :— 'Has the Resident at Bushire legal power to pass a sentence of imprisonment to be carried out in the Bombay Jail. ' There is no precedent, and I ask with reference to the case of Marwareed, the Hindu convert, should it be necessary to try him on a criminal charge.' 361. Our letter No. 673-^ dated 26th March, Lieutenant-Colonel Political A., August 1877, Nos. 42-45. Prideaux was desired to try Marwareed himself at Bushire, and to carry out at that place the sentence passed on him in such manner as might appear to him (Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux) to be most advisable. Accordingly the prisoner was tried by him on the 25th of June under I Criminal breach of trust. s 6 ^, 0 ' .4 0 9ll of the Indian Penal Code and having pleaded guilty was sentenced to undergo six months' rigorous imprisonment. In case the punishment should appear disproportionate to the gravity of the man's offence. Colonel Prideaux explained that he thought it right to take into consideration the fact that he had already suffered six months' detention at Bushire, as well as the difficulties attendant on carrying out the execution of the sentence in a place where there was no regularly organized jail. 362. Under these circumstances Colonel Prideaux's proceedings were approved. S640FDio6 363. The chief feature of interest in the case is the acknowledgment by the Persian Government of the Resident's jurisdiction in such cases, and the enforce ment of that jurisdiction by the trial, sentence, and puhishment of the offender.

This authority is subject however to certain provisoes. • We left the previous correspondence on the subject in paragrapn 334.t07 (xlvii). Amendments of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council in 1895. 366. By an order of Her Majesty in Council dated 3rd October 1895, the External a., January 1896, Nos. 66-68. Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1 1 . t . , 1889, was amended by repealing article ^ an j u ^,9 . not ^ ein g subject of a Muhammadan Power ' in article ^4, ar ^ c ^ e should be read and construed as if the words rersian subject or had been inserted before the word ' foreigner ' wherever that word occurs. 367. This amendment was made as a difficulty was experienced in carrying out into effect article 33» clause (1) of the order which is explained in the External A., November 1894, Nos. 119-122. following Despatch of the Government of , ^ , India to the Secretary of State, No» 202, dated 24th October 1894:— ' It will be seen, however, from the papers cited in the annexed list that some difficulty has been experienced at Bushire in carrying into effect article 33, clause (1) of which requires that every civil suit in which a British subject is a defendant, and a Persian subject is a plaintiff, shall be heard by a Court established under the order. To this procedure the Persian Agent for Foreign Affairs at Bushire has strongly objected on the ground that he had no official cognisance by any Order in Council, and that the procedure laid down in article 33 would be an innovation in which he had no authority to acquiesce. We addiessed Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, on the question of British jurisdiction in respect of civil claims brought by Persians against British subjects at Bushire and as to the procedure by which that jurisdiction should be exercised, enquiring also whether any formal notice had been given to the Persian Government regarding the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1889. Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires has replied that, in view of the existing provisions of the Treaty of Turkomanchai, which is the fundamental basis on which all judicial procedure where Persians and foreigners are concerned is grounded, it would not be possible, if the local authorities object, to order the attendance of Persian subjects in a foreign Court in Persia. He adds that as British subjects alone are amenable to the provisions of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, no formal notice of its existence has been given to the Persian Government. Clause 1 of article 33 of the Order has been copied from the Zanzibar Order in • Articles, Treaty of Comm.,ce.. 839. ST 0 '' bU !: c0rres P 0ndi ,'g clau ^ Urder was based on a special agreement* with the Sultan of Maskat which completely excludes the jurisdiction of the Sultan in all disputes between his subjects and British subjects, when the former are complainants. There is thus no anology between jurisdiction in the case of Zanzibar subjects and Persian subjects, and we are of opinion that section 33 of the latter order is faulty in that it assumes an exclusive jurisdiction in suits in which Persians have claimed against British subjects which the British Government did not apparently possess prior to the date of the Order in Council. This assertion of exclusive jurisdiction in the case of Persian plaintiffs is the more remark able. because in section 34 of the Order jurisdiction can only be exercised in the case of foreigners, i .e., other than Persians—with the consent of the proper authority of the plaintiff's nation so that the Order would have been to place Persian subjects in their own country in a worse position relatively to their own Courts than other foreigners. We are not aware what authority there can be for this. A further difficulty arises from the fact that in the case of suits governed by the Order in Council, article 6 precludes the continuance of any informal system of disposal, such as prevailed before the Order came into force, by requiring that all British jurisdiction shall be exercised, as far as may be, under, and according to, the provisions of the order. In these circumstances we would suggest for the consideration of Her Majesty's Government thai the Order in Council should be amended, or that the formal sanction of the Persian Government to our exercise of the jurisdiction should be obtained.' 368. It was then pointed out that the Persia Order, iSSg, and the Persian , A ,, D x , 0 Coast order, differed inter alia in this that External A., May 1895, N ob. 79-87, ^ the head ' Foreign ' in the former includ- ed, and in the latter excluded, Persian subjects. But for this difference, articles 60 -63 of the Persia order were in almost identical terms wdth article 34 of the coast order. If therefore article 33 of the latter order was repealed, and article 34 made to correspond with articles 60-63 the former, Persian subjects would be on the same footing under both orders. The Persian coast order could be harmonized either by altering the interpretation of ' Foreigner ' in article 3, so as to make it include Persian subjects, or by making article 34 apply to Persian subjects, as it does to foreigners.

This question was raised by Colonel Pelly in 1872, and the actino- Advocate-General, Bombay, Mr. C. J. Mayhew, expressed as his opinion that a natural born subject of Her Majesty, who is also entitled to the privileges of a Persian subject, is in Persia entitled to British protection, although he may not have ceased to be a Persian subject in accordance with Persian law and usage. This opinion was, Mr, Mayhew thought, in consonance with Article 4 of 33 Vict., C. 14 (1870):— 'Any person who, by reason of his having been born within the dominions of Her Majesty, is a natuial born subject, but who also at the time of his birth became, under the law of any foreign state, a subject of such state, and is still such subject, may, if of full age, and not under any disability, make a declaration of alienage in manner aforesaid and from and after the making of such declaration of alienage, such person shall cease to be a British subject' 388. The Advocate-General's opinion was sent by the Government of Bombay to Colonel Pelly for intormation and guidance (G. R. No. 5446, dated 14th December 1872). 389. The same question arose in 1874 before the Government of India, Secret, January 1871, N09,7-21. ^ nd Mr - Paul, the officiating Advocate- Political a ., September 1874, Nos. 54-70. General, held that a person born in British pri ' ted Secre '' Sep - f erritor y °f Persian parents and residing in Persia, is not entitled to British pro tection unless such right of protection is exercised by other powers. The reasons given by him are interesting and quoted below It may be stated, as a general rule, that a person of Persian origin born in British territory is a British subject In M. Stephens Blackstone's Commentaries, sixth edition, vol. ii, p. 433, the law is thus stated|:—As to natural born subjects :—And first, all persons born within the United Kingdom or in the Colonies fall within this description ; and this extends even to those born of aliens residing in th?s country, provided their parents were not at the time in enmity with our Sovereign (see also ' Phillimore's International Law,' P- 345)- But the above proposition does not of itself, in my opinion, carry with it the consequence that a British subject of Persian origin is entitled to British protection in Persia, The question whether a British subject of Persian origin is or is not so entitled to protection in Persia will depend upon a variety of considerations which I will presently notice. By the common law of England, a person born of English parents in a country not parcel of the British dominions was an alien. This rule was subject to some exceptions not necessary to be stated. The restriction of the common law was subsequently relaxed by several statutes, and the present law of England on the subject of children born of English parents may be generally stated as follows. That persons born abroad, whose fathers or grandfathers by the father's side were natural born subjects, are deemed to be natural born subjects (2 Stephens'' Commentaries,' sixth edition, pp. 433 and 424). By the Ci Code Napoleon,' Book 1, Article 10, it is provided that every child of a Frenchman in a foreign country is French. Vattle, in his ' Law of Nationa,' Book I, Chapter XIX, writes as follows: [ say that in order to be of a country it is necessary that a person be born of a father who is a citizen, for if he is born of a foreigner it will be only the place of his birth and not of the country. Further on, in the same chapter, the following observations occur:— It is asked whether the children born of citizens in a foreign country are citizens? The laws have decided this question in several countries, and these regulations must be followed. By the law of nature alone children follow the condition of their father, and enter into all their rights, the place of birth produces no change in this particular, and cannot of itself furnish any reason for taking away from a child what nature has given him ; I say of itself, for civil or political laws may for particular reasons ordain otherwise. But I suppose the father has not entirely quitted his country in order to settle elsewhere. If he has fixed his abode in a foreign country, he has become a member of another society, at least as a perpetual inhabitant, and his children will be members also. These authorities show that it is a matter of difficulty and nicety to determine whether in any given case a person of foreign origin born in a country other than that of his father S640FD114 is to be considered a subject of the country of origin. It appears to me that in the present case, having regard to the Treaty with Persia hereafter to be noticed, it is absolutely necessary to determine whether by the laws of Persia, a person of Persian origin born in British India is or is not a Persian subject. Owing to my possessing no knowledge of the laws of Persia, not having the means of obtaining such knowledge, i am wholly unable to solve the above question and to determine whether such a person as above described is a Persian subject. Article IX of the Treaty with Persia is as follows The High Contracting Parties engage that in the establishment and recognition of Consols-General, Consuls. Vice-Consuls, and Consular Agents, each shall be placed in the dominion-s of the other on the footing of the most favoured nation, and that the treatment of their respective subjects and their trade shall also in every respect be placed on the footing of the treatment of the subjects and com merce of the most favoured nation,' Article XII of the same Treaty is as follows:—Saving the provisions in the latter part of the preceding Article the British Government will renounce the right of protecting hereafter any Persian subject not actually in the employment of the British Mission, or of British Consuls General, Consuls, Vice-Consuls, or Consular Agents, provided that no such right is accorded or exercised by any other foreign power ; but in this, as in all other respects, the British Government requires, and the Persian Government engages that the same privileges and immunities shall in Persia be conferred upon and shall be enjoyed by the British Government, its servants and its subjects and that the same consideration shall be shown for them and shall be enjoyed by them as are conferred upon and enjoyed by and shown to the most favoured foreign Government, its servants and subjects*' If a person of Persian origin born in British India is a Persian subject, I think that such a person would not, according to the proper construction of the provisions of the Treaty above quoted, be entitled to British protection, unless such right of protection under similar circumstances is exercised by any other foreign power. It will be noted that an exception is made in respect of Persian subjects in the service of the British Government. It may, however, be contended that although such a person as above described may be a Persian subject, he is also a British subject, and that therefore he is entitled to the immunities and privileges conferred by the latter portion of Article 12. To this the correct answer would be that the British Government has renounced the right of protecting Persian subjects with certain exceptions, which do not cover the ordinary case of a Persian subject who may also be a British subiect, and that the en^aee- ment of the Persian Government, to the effect that privileges and immunities shall be enjoyed by British subjects, must of necessity only apply to cases of persons who are British subjects, and not Persian subjects. A different rule of construction would be opposed to the history of British or other European protection in the East. . O ne of the fading principles of international law laid down in I. Phillimore's interna tional law, page 355, is as follows :— ' The right of jurisdiction, civil and criminal, over all persons and things within the terntoiial limits, which is incident to a state relatively to its own subjects, and their own property, extends also, as a general rule, to foreigners commovant in the land.' As to the exceptions to tha territorial right of jurisdiction. Sir R. Bhillimore in oa^e 301 of the above volume, writes as follows:— ' ^ 5 ( fiT T1 l e firSt Cl j SS 0 i f exce P tlone t0 tllls ruIe is founded upon local usages and the reason f .v!! 2 ' fu P rincl P a,, y , tothe status o( Christians in infidel countries. So early as the sixth century a derogation from the rule of European International Law began to develop itself. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Code of the Visicroths not the least remarkable monument of the middle a S es. conceded to foreign merchants the'prlvileire of being tried by judges selected from among their own countrymen. But after the Ottoman power became established m Europe, Christian nations trading with the tferri- ones subiect to that power, obtained from it, at different periods, a concession of exclusive authonty over then own subjects, nearly identical with that which the Christian ' Jus Commune had conceded to foreign ships of war m their ports. The vital and ineradicable differences which must a ways separate the Christian from the Mahomedan or infidel the immiscible character wh.ch their religion impresses upon their social habits, moral sent' ments, and poht.cal institutions necessitated a departure from the strict rule of territorial orTnfidlrdimintons' 36 Commercial establishments in Ottoman The same subject is stated by Lord Stowell, in the case of the Indian Chief Rob Adm. Reports, pages 23 and 24, as follows ' 0 u But taking it that such a permanent sovereignty on the part of the Moaul nrinces rTeM y there SO sti fit 1^10 b ad that ^ ritain 1 Cann0t be deemed t0 P ossess ^ sovereign p g.t there, still it is to be remembered that wherever even a more factory is founded inii5 the eastern parts of the world, European persons trading under the shelter and protection of those establishments are conceived to take their national character from that association under which they live and carry on their commerce.' It is a rule of the law of nations applying particularly to those countries, and is different from what prevails ordinarily in Europe and the western parts of the world, in which men take their national character from the general character of the country in which they are resident, and this distinction arises from the nature and habit of the countries. In the western parts of the world alien merchants mix in the society of the natives; access and intermixture are permitted, and they become incorporated to almost the full extent. But in the east, from the oldest times, an immiscible character has been kept up. Foreigners are not admitted into the general body and mass of the society of the nation; they continue strangers and sojourners as all their fathers were. ' Dorsi amara suam non intermiscit tendam.' Not requiring any national character under the general sovereignty of the country, and not trading under any recognized authority of their own original country, they have been held to derive their present character from that of the association or factory under whose protection they live and carry on their trade. These authorities establish the position that, in the absence of Treaty, local usage in Mahomedan countries m the east, has engrafted an exception to the general territorial jurisdiction in favour of Christians, by giving them the ■protection of their own factories and Consuls ; but that this exception would not extend to Mahomedans, who might be living, for the time beina, in Mahomedan countries. This being the state of the law and usage in the absence of Treaty, it seems most unlikely that the Persian Government intended to allow Persians, who may be Persian subjects as also British subjects to be exempted from the operation of their territorial law. 390. The Government of India in endorsing this opinion desired that the Resident's interposition on behalf of such persons should be restricted to affording his good offices as in the case of ordinary Persian subjects (Mr. Aitchison's letter, dated 5th September 1874). 391. In 1876 Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran reported to the Foreign , „ ^ „ Office that the Persian Government had ecret, eptem er i 7 , os. 90 9. v granted a Persian subject Agha Mehedi, born in India of Persian parents, the right of trading on payment of the 5 per cent, duty established by treaty for British merchants, but that they had given notice that they would in future consider and treat such persons as Persian subjects within Persian territory. The Foreign Office (Lord Derby) after consulting the Law Officers held (Foreign Office to Mr. Taylour Thompson), No. 49, dated 24th July 1876) :— Assuming the law of Persia applicable to the cases which you expect may arise, to he correctly staled by the Persian Minister, Her Majesty's Government consider that a man born of Persian parents in Her Majesty's dominions cannot in Persia claim or be entitled to the privileges of a British subject, but is in Persia subject to all the obliga tions which the law of Persia imposes upon its own subjects. 392. The British Minister at Tehran accordingly gave the Persian Govern ment to understand that such persons would Political A., October 1877, N03. 121-129. ^ , , j d V i . i •, not be taken under Dntish protection while residing in Persia. 393. It was not intended that this view would affect persons like Mahomed Agha Mehedi whose position as British proteges had long been recognized. Bat the Persian Government declined to treat them as such and when Mahomed Agha Mehedi was charged the rates levied in Persian subjects and the British Minister mad erepresentations, the Persian Government contended that while only 5 per cent, was to be levied from him, the British Legation ought not to interfere in his favour even if charges in excess of 5 p. c. were exacted from him and that he should address his representation direct to the Persian authorities. 394. In 1883 one Abbas Agha Hassan, who was born in Mauritius, complained to tne Governor there that, on applying to E*ternal A., September .884, No,. 2.3-2.9. the Resident on the p ersian Gulf, he had been refused a pass and permission to trade as a British subject in Persia. This led to Sir John Pope Hennessy to represent the matter to Colonel Ross, who in reply pointed out that, although born in Mauritius, Abbas Agha Hassan was of Persian parentage and the fact of birth in a British dominion did116 not entitle such persons to British protection and privileges in Persia, but that only good offices could be extended to them by the Residency. The Resident quoted Lord Derby's ruling of July 1876 (Colonel Ross to the Governor of Mauritius, No. 93, dated 29th February 1884). The reply of Colonel Ross was approved by Earl Granville (Ronald Thompson to Colonel Ross, No. 24, dated 18th July 1884). (liv) Status in Persia of Persians born and domiciled in India and British born Persians : Case of Haji Mohamed Kermani, 1884. 395. In 1884 the Persian Consul-General raised in a letter to the Bombay . „ , 00 xt Government two questions ;— External A., September 1884, Nos, 220 23a. (1) whether Government could grant certificates of naturalization to Persian born subjects domiciled in British India and (2) whether children bom in British India of Persian parents could be considered natural born British subjects. The Persian Consul-General conten- ed that the British Government, according to the convention of 1857 (article 12), agreed not to accept any application from the Shah's subjects for naturalization and could not grant certificates of naturalization to the class under (1) and could not regard the latter class (2) as British subjects. There was at this time also an application from Haji Mahomed Kerman ) a Persian, who had settled in Bombay in 1859, and had several children born in Bombay, whom he sent to Yezd in Persia. He claimed a certificate declaring them British subjects, so that they might reside in Persia as such. 396. The Government of India expressed the opinion that certificates of naturalization could be granted to class No. 1 under Act XXX of 1852, and that the treaty of 1857 did not preclude such a course of action, but that having regard to section 8, such persons could not claim in Persia as against the Persian Government the rights and privileges of a British subject. On the 2nd point reference was invited to Lord Derby's Despatch of 24th July 1876. (Ivj Status of a British naturalized subject of Persian origin ; Case of Abdul Hussain Shirazi of Bombay : Lord Salisbury's ruling, 1889. 397. Abdul Hussain, whose father had obtained a certificate of naturalization _ t , a ^ u 00 m c ' ln ^58 and with whom as a minor External A., March 1889, Nos. 8-18. i i i 7 i . , he had been then living, was travel ling in Egypt with passport from the Government of Bombay describing him and his children as British subjects. The question arose whether he was amenable to the jurisdiction of the Persian Consul-General in Egypt. Lord Salisbury in writing to Sir E. Baring (No. 16, dated nth January 1889) stated— It is to be borne in mind that on the consideration of the question that British Indian naturalization has no legal effect beyond the limits of British India and although Abdul Hussain's passport is sufficient to entitle him to British diplomatic and consular protection in foreign country; it would not necessarily be sufficient in strict law to withdraw him from Persian jurisdiction in Persia nor from the jurisdiction of the Persian Consular Court in the Ottoman dominions, when those courts have ex-territorial jurisdiction. But as from enquiries made it had been found that Persian subjects, who had received Persian naturalization had been treated as Russian subjects in Persia, Lord Salisbury decided that Abdul Hussain Shirazi should be considered and treated in Egypt as a British protected subject and as outside the Persian Consul-General's juirisdiction. 398. In a reference made in February 1892 by the Resident, Sir Francis external a, may .892, nos. b. o -.30-.33.

In March 1893 Colonel Talbot, with a view to prepare correct lists of External A., June 1892, Nos. uS-np. registered British subjects, enquired whether n/T_T_ 1 &lt;. j 1 they should include names of many Mahomedan traders whose ancestors left Sind or Cutch and settled in Persia ong ago, without returning to the country of their origin. He drew attention to the law as laid down by Lord Stanley in his despatch, dated 12th November Political a., February 1868, n03.345.246. *^67, that the grandsons of British subjects ... n . „ . . who have acquired a Persian domicile (of origin) are Persian, not British subjects, and as such are not entitled to protection. 401. In reply he was told (letter No. 924^., dated 19th May 1892) Action 59 of the order only requires the Consul-General to send to the Governor- General of India in Council, for transmission to Her Majesty's Secretary of State a renort containing (amongst other matter) ' an abstract of the list of registered British' subjects ' c* th 6 persons who have already been registered as British subjects. Section 38, Sub-section (1), of the Order recognises registration effected prior to the date of the order, as it specially accepts from the necessity of registration under that section persons - already repstered ''. Thus under Section 59 of the Order you are merely required to s nd an dbstract of the list of persons whose names have been registered as British subjects, whether be.ore or after the commencement of the order ; and you are not only bound, but have no authority to revise this list, and exclude from it persons whom you may consider (perhaps correctly) to have been improperly registered. 402. The purport of this order was explained in 1892 in connection with the case of Malek-ut-J ujjar (see paras. 405-406 below). (Iviii) Dispute between Malek-ut-Tujjar and Moin-ut-Tujjar about certain immoveable property at Bushire and the claim of the former to British Consular protection, 1892. 403. The facts of the case are as follows. There were three brothers named External a .., September 1892, nos. 832.358. Mahomed, Haji Baba and Agha . t Mahomed Ali, all natives of Kazran in a rs. The second Haji Baba—grandfather of the Malek-ut-Tujjar—-emigrated [So^FDj 43■ i if f ' m 1 118 about the year 1830 to Calcutta, where he settled as a trader, and took out letters of naturalization as a British subject. Haji Baba had, with other issue, a son, named Mahomed Hussain, born in Calcutta, and Mahomed Hussain had a son, who is the Malek-ut-Tujjar in question, also born in Calcutta. Subsequently Mahomed Hussain died while on pilgrimage to Kerbella, and the grandfather, Haji Baba, in 1870 removed to Bushire with the grandson, the Malek, and settled there. 404. From 1870 continuously up to 1888 the Malek-ut-Tujjar resided at Bushire, and, while there, held offices under the Persian Government, including that of Governor of Bushire. During this period he succeeded to the property of his grandfather and his two great-uncles and thus became involved in disputes with a nephew of the wife of Haji Abdul Mahomed, who is known as the Muin- ut-Tujjar. Finally, on the 19th April 1888, the Malek registered himself as a British Indian subject at the British Consulate. In the latter part of that year he removed with his family to Bombay, where he had since lived, leaving agents in Persia to look after his interests there. In 1892 an application was made by the Moin-ut-Tujjar to the Persian Government for permission to take possession of immoveable property at Bushire belonging to the Malek, on the strength of certain documents of transfer said to have been executed by the latter. 405. The Resident's original view of the matter, in which Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran expressed his concurrence, was that the case was governed by the ruling conveyed by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs • Paraerauh TO1 above in his despatch* No. 49, dated 24th July 1876, to Her Majesty s Ministerat Tehran, that a man born of Persian parents in Her Majesty's dominions cannot in Persia claim or be entitled to the privileges of a British subject, but is in Persia subject to all the obligations which the law of Persia imposes upon its own subjects.' According to this view the Malek could not claim in Persia the status of a British Indian subject. The Resident, however, modified . D . . this view in consequence of the receipt t Pafagraph 401 above. r i • ta i . *,t or the foreign Department letterf No. 924-E., dated the 19th May, which he understood to contain the ruling that registration as British subject, such as that affected by the Malek-ut-Tujjar at the Consulate, is binding unless invalidated by subject non-residence, and that a person so registered can claim protection against Persian Government. 406. The Government of India pointed out that Resident had misapprehended Foreign Department letter of the 19th May. The question, with reference to which that letter was written, was merely whether he had the power to revise the list of persons registerad as British and protected subjects, and the question was decided in the negative, on the grounds that the fact of registration of person's name was merely evidence that a claim to be considered a British subject had been advanced, and was not so preposterous as to be summarily rejected, but that registration does not bind even the Consul to treat a person so registered as British subject j if not so in fact, and certainly does not operate as conclusive proof that such a person possesses the status claimed. 407. As regards the particular case referred to them, the Government of India were of opinion that, although the Malek-ut-Tujjar was, reason of his birth within British dominions, of a father who was then a British subject—a natural born British subject, his long and continuous residence at Bushire, combined with the fact of his entry into Persian service, warranted the conclusion that he had afterwards adopted a Persian domicile; and it was at least questionable whether his somewhat recent removal to Bombay had taken place under circum stances sufficient to revive his domicile of origin. This being the position, and in the absence of any treaty stipulations to the contrary, the Malek's rights to both immoveable and moveable property at Bushire should be determined by the Persian Courts. The question of domicile would in any case only affect the claim to'|moveable property, and that, even if the case were one for the intervention of the Consul, the right of the Malek to immoveable property would be governed by the Persian law (No, I65-E., dated 8th September 1892).ng (Hx) Cases of Seth Apcar and his son Vagharshak Apcar, 1892-93. 407-A. Seth Apcar was born in Calcutta of Persian Armenian parents and External A., December .89., No,. S-S?- ^ I P^P 0 ' Certifying that he Was a British subject by birth. He was, however, up to the year 1892 treated as a Persian subject while in Persia, but in conse quence of Lord Salisbury's ruling* in his despatch to Sir E. Baring, dated 1 ith Janu ary 1889, the Resident received instructions from the Government of India that persons in the position of Messrs. Apcar should be regarded as British subjects in Persia. 407-B. Lord Salisbury's ruling of 1889, however, had been modified by Lord Rosebury's ruling in 1893. The question was then whether he could in view of this ruling be regarded as a British subject. Mr. Seth Apcar's father died in 1847 in India, where he had emigrated at the commencement of the 19th century. There was no evi dence, however, whether he had naturalized himself as a British subject. The Persian Naturalization Law (Act of 1894) would require that the Shah's per mission should be obtained to change nationality of a Persian subject. 407-C. Such being the difficulties in regard to Seth Apcar's nationality, „ t ^ . x , there arose in 1903 the question regarding External A., December 1903,1^03.20-27. ,, . ,. - 7 ( y i . ^ ita tt the nationality of his son V. Apcar. He was born in Persia but was in the service of Messrs. Apcar of Calcutta. He went to Persia in 1903 with a passport describing him as a British sub ject, hy birth ) which was a mistake committed in the Foreign Office at Calcutta. The Karguzar, in respecting the passports, declared it to be invalid and insisted on Mr. Apcar paying 60 Krans for a Persian passport plus a fine of 250 Krans, He further impounded the passport. The question of V. Apcar's nationality depended on the view taken of the status of his father. 407-D. Colonel Kemball in writing to Sir A. Hardinge pointed out these difficulties, but urged that the Karguzar had no right to impound the passport or to fine Mr. Apcar and was entitled only to the usual visa fee. On representa tions being made at Tehran instructions were issed to the Karguzar to return the passport and remit the fine, if it was not in accordance with the passport regulations. (ix) Question of grant of certificates of naturalization to persons of Persian origin residing in India, 1892. 408. In this letter No. 4932, dated 1st August 1892, to the Government of „ India, the Bombay Government enquired External a., December 1892, os. 47-50. ^ the views held by the Government of India regarding the grant of certificates of naturalization to different classes of persons and among others to merchants carrying on trade from Bombay with Persia. The practice of the Bombay Government was to refuse certificate of naturalization to a Persian subject unless the applicant established beyond dis pute his intention to take up a permanent settlement in India. The Government of India entirely approved of the course followed by the Bombay Government (letter No. 2112-E., dated 16th November 1892). (Ixi) Question as to the grant of passport to one Abdullah bin Hussain bin Ali Soom- aya of Lingah, born in Bombay of a Bahreinese naturalized British subject, 1900. 409. The above person applied to the Bombay Government for a passport. He was born in Bombay in 1865, his father being a native ^ of Bahrein and ^ 10 years after the applicant's birth, his father was granted certificate of naturaliza tion as a British Indian subject. In these circumstances he was a British subject * See paragraph 397 above.I 20 by birth and unless he had changed his nationality he was entitled to a passport as such. The father, however, had taken up his residence at Lingah in the ser vice of a British Company. On reference to the Government of India, they held that this circumstance by itself did not deprive him of his status as a naturalized British subject. Bahrein was not a Persian possession, but the present status of the applicant's father would not affect the applicant ; there appeared in the cir cumstances stated no valid reason for refusing the passport applied for (No. 915- E., dated 28th April 1900). (Ixii) Status of Messrs. Malcolm of Bushire, 1872. 410. Messrs. Malcolm of Bushire had for many years been treated as British proteges, though Persian subjects, but this Political A., June 1872, Nos. 271-302. •*! j-UD' J privilege was contested by the Persian authorities in 1871. The history of the family Is told in Colonel Pelly's letter No. 55—19, dated 13th January 1872, to the Bombay Government:— /st. —A period of more than half a century has elapsed since the grandfather of the present proteges was introduced to British protection ; and, on more than one occasion, he was in charge of this Residency during the absence of the Resident. the 10th December 1830 (that is to say, more than forty years ago), the Me enclosure No. 2890 o! .S30. f ? ther of ^ the protection of this Residency by His Excel lency the then Governor of Bombay on the ground of the claims of his family on the Bri tish Government. jrd. —On the 13th August 1845, Her Majesty's then Minister at Tehran instructed Vide enclosure to Sir Justin Shell's despatch of 3rd this Residency that the Earl of Aberdeen had August 1845. given his sanction that British protection should be extended to Mr, Malcolm and his brothers'* 4^.—-In 1849 the question of Messrs.

Messrs. Malcolm elected to pay the five per cent, duty, and have, I believe, continued to pay it down to this day. jth. —When the war with Persia broke out in 1846-57, the Malcolm family were con sidered and treated as British subjects, were removed accordingly on boardship, and suffer ed in their trade and general interests, in common with other British subjects. 6th. —The present proteges, whose right to protection is now called in question by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, were included among the families enjoying British protection, as above set forth before the war, Fzfik Mr, Alison's letter of 8th September quoted in yth.—At the conclusion of the War^ it was my letter to Mr. s.

Mr AHson^—- folIoWing WaS the 0 P inion expressed by the Foreign Office to No. t6, dated Foreign Office, 18th March 1872. From E arl G r.kv.lle, K G., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, To— C. A lison, Esq., C.B.. Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. 1 have been in communication with the Indk Office and the proper Law Officer of the crown on yoiir despatch 157 ot the 3rd November last respecting the levy by Mohamed Khan, late Governor of Yezd of 559 Krans on some sngar belonging to Messrs. Malcdm Pers.an subjects under Br.t.sh protecfon at Bushire, and I have been advised that Messrs' Malcolm are ent.tled to rece.ve the support of Her Majesty's Government in resisting the imposition of the tax in question, and that the Persian authorities cannot now with any reason mamtam that Messrs. Malcolm are not entitled to the protection ot Her MaLtv's Government, seeing that they have bee,, treated as British subjects by those authoritTes Custom HcmseCertificates. Per ^ 0n their *°° ds uf the usual I understand from your despatch above referred to that British subjects pay once for all import duty of 5 per cent wh.'e natives pay comparatively a very small import duty but are liable to pay transit duties from which British subjects are exempt. Upon the general question as to the proper interpretation to be given to the Treaty of Pans, I am of opinion that this Treaty was not being continued to persons who had prior to the Treaty engaged it, 4 I 3- ^ *877 the question was raised whether Messrs. Malcolm were entitled Political A., January 1878, Ncs. x 19-120. ^ own British vessels and fly the British 414. The opinion of the Advocate-General (Mr. G. C. Paul) was taken by the Government of India in which they agreed (their letter No. 180 -P., dated loth January 1878), and is quoted below:— Se p h0 . n l \? fthe Mercha ' t Shi PP»ng Act, 1854. it is provided that no ship shall be deemed a British ship unless she belongs wholly to owners of the following description : (1) Natural born British subjects. (2) Persons made denizens by denization or naturalized by or pursuant to any Act the Im P e ' a } Legislature or by or pursuant to any Act or Ordinance of the prope; legislative authority in any British possession. (3) Bodies corporate as described in such Section. Messrs. Malcolm and Co. of Bushire, although Persian subjects, have, as regards their trade under the circumstances detailed in the papers submitted with this case, been allowed British protection, and the question is whether the extension of such protection enables Messrs, Malcolm and Co. to own British ships. Having regard to the terms or bection 18 above quoted, I am of opinion that the firm of Messrs. Malcolm and Co. are not entitled to ovvn British ships. They do not come within the descriptions contained in sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 18. The right to fly the British flag appertains to a British ship, and the improper assumption of the British character by flyincr the British flag is made punishable by Section 103 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854. The same [S640FD]122 Act also provides for the forfeiture to Her Majesty of any interest acquired in a British ship by an unqualified person (see Section 103) except in certain cases of interests trans mitted by reason of death or marriage (see Section 32) when applications for sale to the Civil Courts are allowed. (Ixiii) Demand made by the Persian Government for the surrender of one Hassan Ahmed, a Persian subject, employed as a Pilot on board the Indian Govern ment Steamer ' Amberwitch.' 415. On the 8th January 1877 the Resident at Bushire asked Lieutenant Stiffe. Commanding Indian Government Political A , September 1877, Nos. 257-265. Steamer to surrender his pilot, Hassan Ahmed, a Persian subject, in accordance with request of the Persian Government who had claims against him. Lieutenant Stiffe replied that Hassan Ahmed was no longer employed on board the Amherwitch ) and that he did not know where he was. He at the same time addressed the following questions to the Government of Bombay :— ' (1) Whether should such an order for the extradition of a Persian or Arab pilot employed on Government duty on board the vessel under my command be complied with, ' (a) Whether in the event of the man refusing to proceed on shore, I am authorised to seize him by force, and deliver him to the Persian authorities on shore, or whether the latter should send officers on board to capture him. ' (3) Whether such extradition should be carried out in the case of a person repre senting himself as a refugee from oppression as was the case of this man.' 416. The Bombay Government submitted the case to the Foreign Depart- „ j . j J* m o ^tnent for orders, and observed that the Bombay No. .972-P., dated 3rd April 1877. did not appear to have made any enquiry into the facts of the case. Foreign Department No. 1140-?., dated 19th The Foreign Department sent the papers Ma y i8 77* to the Resident for opinion and report on the facts. 417. In reply to this call, Colonel Prideaux submitted two letters from Resident, Persian Gulf, Nos. 147 and 148, dated 15th June 1877. In the first he showed that it was the practice of the Persian authorities at Bushire to exact from pilots a large portion of their earnings; in one case 530 krans were deducted out of 600 krans, and that this was their method of taxing pilots. The latter naturally look every possible means to evade payment; sometimes they stopped on board the vessels in which they were employed as long as they remained at Bushire Harbour; sometimes they landed at other ports where the authorities were less strict. The light in which Colonel Prideaux regarded these pilots was that of defaulting tax-payers, and he held that the Persian authorities acted within their right in demanding the surrender of their own subjects in their own waters, although on board an Indian Government vessel. With regard to the remark of the Bombay Government that he had not made any enquiry into the facts, Colonel Prideaux observed:— 'The local authorities having fulfilled every requirement of international courtesy by demanding the surrender of the pilot through the Residency, it would have been beyond my province to have enquired into the merits of a dispute between the Persian Government and one of its own subjects. The Amberwitch was lying within Persian territorial waters and the right of the Persian Government, as represented by the locsl authorities, to demand the pilot's surrender was not dependent on the question whether the claim against him was a just one or not.' 418. The Government of India on their letter No. 1984-P., dated 14th August 1877, st;ates •— in reply, I am to observe that if the steamer Amherwitch is not in the position of a public f hip of the Indian Government, the Persian authorities are entitled to execute process on board the vessel, for the surrender of the pilot, in accordance with Persian law. And even if the Amherwitch is a public ship, the Governor-General in Council considers that the Persian Government can exercise the same jurisdiction in this particular case. There may be a difference of opinion as to the precise extent to the immunity ot a public123 ship from the jurisdiction of the State within whose territorial waters it may be found, but that immunity does not extend so far as to exempt subjects of that State from process under the law of the State to which they are subject, nor can it be presumed, unless the circum stances are very exceptional, that any such State will concede to foreign ships a right to withdraw its subjects from the jurisdiction to which they are liable by their allegiance, by landing them elsewhere than on Persian soil. The Commanders of the Indian Government vessels may therefore either ply with requisitions of the nature under notice, or may allow the Persian authorities to take the pilots away themselves. (Ixiv) Status of persons born of Indians in Persia. Case of Mahomed bin Abdulla of Minab, 419. In October 1879 Colonel Ross referred the application of a person _ ... . A vox,. named Mahomed bin Abdulla, residing: Political A., December 1879, Nos. 6-9. ... , r-. i a i i • at Minab, near Bandar Abbas, in Persian territory, to be enrolled as a British Indian subject, and to be protected as such. The father of this man was in his youth a Hindu by religion and an inhabitant of Multan, whence he emigrated to Persia about 1871 and soon after became a convert to Muhammadanism and married a Persian woman of Minab. The applicant was the issue of the marriage, born in Persia, a land-owner and domiciled permanently, as was the father, in that country. 419-A. It was not alleged that the applicant (or any of the family) had ever been formally enrolled as a British subject, but he maintained that they have ever considered themselves entitled to that status. The Persian officials, on the other hand, averred that the applicant has pre viously asserted himself a subject of Persia and claimed him as such. In 1862 it was ruled that the Khojah or Lootiyah emigrants from Sind, who Government of India letter No. 313, dated sth settled at Maskat previous to the British March 1862, to Goremment of Bombay, etc. conquest of Sind, and acquiring a Maskat domicile, had never returned to their native country after its conquest, are not entitled to be considered British subjects. The same ruling would, the Resident presumed, apply to similar settlers in Persia, and in the present instance the fact of the original emigrant becoming a Muhammadan, strengthens the presumption that he had completely abandoned his native country as well as religion. 419-B. It would appear therefore that the father was never in reality a British subject, though doubtless it would have been open to him at any time during his life after the British annexation to become so, whilst the son, the applicant, had a Persian domicile of origin coupled with permanent residence in Persia. 41Q-C. After consulting the Advocate General (G. C. Paul), the Govern ment of India held that the man in question was not entitled to be enrolled as a British subject: he was a Persian subject and it appeared from the Resident's report that the Persian authorities claimed him as such (No. 2629^., dated 8th December 1879), (Ixv) Claim of theBombay and Persian (Steam Navigation Company for Consular protection on the Persian Gulf, 1881. 420. In 1880 the Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company in a „ , petition to the Government of Bombay Secret, September 1880, Nos. 131- 134. 4 1 ,1 , .1 • 1 • • . j represented that their ships were registered as British ships and carried the British flag. They therefore prayed that their agents might receive the assistance of British Consuls and Political Officers in the Persian Gulf in matters connected with the company's views and the cargo carried and offered for carriage in those views. 421. Colonel Ross reported that the company was composed of Persian and British Indian shareholders, amongst the Political a ., March 1881, Nos. 68-69. Persians many being residents of Bushire,124 Miraz, Ispahan, Tehran, Yezd and Bombay, some of them being naturalized British subjects. The steamships owned by the Company were registered as British ships and carried British colours. The Local Agents and in the Persian Gulf ports were Persian subjects, but in the Resident's opinion, they were entitled to assistance from British representatives in all matters concerning British ships and cargo. 432. The following opinion was expressed by Mr. Latham, Acting Advocate Secret, Oo.ob.c .880, No.. .3,-.37. Gen , era1, (N0 - 8 5' dated 2nd Se P- tember 1080) :— he Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company' appears to be registered in Bombay, and to^ have its registered office here. The Company is therefore a ' body corporate established subject to the laws of and having its principal place of business in a British possession,' and as such is within the 3rd clause of the 18th Section of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, and qualified to be the owner of a British ship, whatever may be the nationalities of the shareholders in the Company. The Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, is clear on the point, and no change has been introduced by the Naturalization Act' 1870 (33 and 34 Vict., C. 15). In the case of 'The Queen versus Arnand,' 92-B.—806, the law was laid down to the same effect on the more stringent words of 8 and 9 V. C 8g, Section 12 ; the principle being that the corporation is the owner of the ship; and that the shareholders are not owners thereof, albeit they have an interest in the property of the corporation. v r j 4p3^ Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed bv the Government of India to grant to the Company the assistance required on the understanding that their Agents at Bushire and other Gulf parts, being Persian subjects, are not personally entitled to British protection or to assistance in matters unconnected with the Company's vessels and trade.'

M. J. Lucas, a telegraph clerk in the Persian Gulf, 1872. 425. Mr. Lucas, an Armenian Christian, born in Persia, was a son of an Arme- judiciai a., June 189,, Nos. 19-20. nian priest, who had resided at Calcutta for Political A., June 1879, Nos 25-30. about 15 years and had served about 13 r\ . , ti - , . , . years in the Indo-European TelepraDh Department at Karachi and in various places in the Gulf. He wished to. obtain a certificate of naturalization as a British subject. The Government rnrnnl*'^rl that there was no objection to the request of Mr. Lucas bein ? complied with, and that the best course for him would be to apply to the ora^n , ua, con ormmg as nearly as possible the instructions marked A and k T SecreUr y of State .

(Ixviii) Lists of British subjects and proteges applied for by Persian authorities, 1877. 428. In June 1877, Moetemid-ud-Dowlah, Governor-General of Fars, demanded Political A., August .877, Nos. 343.348. f ™ m Colonel Prideaux, Officiating Resident, that a nominal roll of the servants and dependants of the British Residency should be furnished to the local authorities at Bushire for transmission to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. 429. In reply the Officiating Resident stated (letter, dated 17th July 1877) that ' to comply with your Royal Highness's request would be equivalent to admitting the claims of the Persian authorities to interfere with my right to employ such servants in this Residency as I may think fit and as such a pretension would be wholly inadmissible, I deeply regret that I am unable to accede to your Royal Highness's demands.' 430. The Government of India approved of Colonel Prideaux's action in declining to accede to the request of the Governor-General of Fars (No. 2053-P., dated 21st August 1877). 431. The request was repeated by the Prince of Fars to Colonel Ross, n 1 a c 4 k _ q — q xr o „ when the latter returned to Bushire, but Political A., September 1878, Nos. 80 go. . i- i • i r i ' was again not complied with for the reasons given in Colonel Ross's reply, dated nth March 1878 : (1) In the first place, owing to the number and diversity of British clients in these parts, many of whom were frequently coming and going and passing through these ports, it would be impossible to frame a complete list, as before it was com plete many alterations would have occurred. Daily it happened that persons em ployed under the British Government or by private persons are discharged or leave their employment and others replace them. To attempt to keep the authorities always informed on such matter would not only be helpless, but it would be worse than useless, and in our opinion would lead to frequent discussions which now scarcely occurred. (2) Whenever there was any doubt as to a person's right to the Resident's protection, and the local authorities wished to have it cleared, they could in a few minutes ascertain and all requisite information is at once furnished to them. (3) Whenever persons in British employment being Persian subjects were accused of any misconduct or breach of the laws, every attention and facility was invariably afforded to the Persian Government authorities, and where crime was proved such persons were never afforded further employment. It was the practice of the Residency to confine to the rights the British enjoy in Persia by Treaty and usage, and not to exceed those bounds. The result was that disputes scarcely ever arose except when persons of evil disposition excited them for their own bad ends. This had happily not been the case of late times in those parts. 432. In commenting upon this correspondence the Secretary of State however stated (despatch No. 44, dated Secret E, January .879, Nos. I3-.7. ^ 0ctober jgjg) that , he Governor- General's application appeared to have been regarded by Colonel Ross as a revival of attempts to interfere with the menial establishment of the Residency at Bushire, which had been uniformly resisted by Her Majesty's Government, and, so viewing it, his reply was a proper one. Her Majesty's Government would not permit any sucTi interference, or allow the recognition by the local authorities of the status of individuals at Bushire as British subjects, or under British protection, to be conditional on the assent of the Government at Teh ran. They were however at the same time of opinion that a list of such persons, if again asked for, might be given as an act of courtesy. [b64©FD]126 4 (Ixix) Zil-es-Sultan's complaint about the Resident not taking a guard when residing outside the town and not furnishing a list of his attendants and follow ers, 1883. aw . In May 1883 His Highness Zil-es Sultan received a complaint from Sahib Dewan that the Resident moved secret e ., August 1883, Nos. 242-246. ^jg residency at Bushire outside the town of Bushire without a guard, and that the Persian authorities were kept ignorant of the number and men who composed his followers and attendants. As to the second complaint Mr. Ronald Thomson informed His Highness that if it referred to a list of British subjects and proteges, no such information had hitherto been given to the Persian authorities and it would not be convenient to do so. [It might be noted that this refusal was contrary to the orders of the Home Govern ment referred to above.] 433-A. As regards the guard the Resident pointed out that Zil-es-Sultan must have been mis-informed, as an ample guard of mounted men and native infantry was always stationed at Sabzabad when the Resident lived there (Resi dent's letter dated 30th ]une 1883). (Ixx) Complaint of the Persian Government against the alleged grant by the Bombay Government of passports to Persians from Lingah after a short residence in India, 1899. 434. In November 1899 the Persian Government complained to Sir Mortimer Durand against grant of pass- Extemai a ., March iqoq , Nos. 4S-59. p 0rts ^ Bombay authorities to certain Persians from Lingah after a month's residence, namely— (1) Abdulla Haji Mahammad Kasim. (2) Mahammad Abdulla Abbas. (3) Ibrahim Mahammad Abdulla. 434-A. The Bombay Government, who were asked to report, forwarded to the Government of India collections of papers detailing the circumstances under which certificates of naturalization and in two cases passports were granted to the following residents of Lingah, whose names resembled those mentioned by the Persian Government— (1) Abdulla bin Mahammad Kasim. ( 2 ) Haji Mahammad Abdulla Abbas, Bastakee. (3) Haji Ibrahim bin Haji Mahammad Abdul Vahid. It appears from the papers that the first of these was granted a certificate of naturalization in 1892 after it was reported that he had been residing in Bombay on and off for a period of 24 years. He was subsequently granted a passport in May 1894 as a naturalized British subject. The 2nd individual was naturalized after a continuous residence of 12 years in Bombay. He was granted a passport as a naturalized British subject in May 1899. The 3rd individual was granted a certificate of naturalization in 1892 on a report from the Commis sioner of Police to the effect that they had been residing in Bombay off and on for a period of years.127 CHAPTER VIII. Claims of British subjects and proteges against the Persian Govern ment and officials and Persian subjects. . 435* shall give in this section a few typical cases of claims of British subjects and proteges against the Persian Government and officials and Persian subjects. (Ixxi) Forcible appropriation of a house belonging to Hajee Nubbee Khan. 436. Hajee Nubbee Khan was a Residency News Agent on the Arab coast Political A., ] m e .875, No,. i 7 8. I9 ,. 0 i the f 61 . 3 '™ Gulf. On the 23rd March 1870 one Agha Muhammad Hassan Bazar- murghee, son-in-law and partner of Hajee Muhammad Baker, bought from Hajee Nubbee Khan indigo to the value of 3,466 tomans, promising to pay for the same in 23 months. Before the expiration of this period Agha Muhammad Hassan became bankrupt. As ther« was then no Governor at Bushire, the creditors laid their claims before Mirza Muhammad Khan, the Foreign Agent, who thereupon imprisoned the bankrupt. 437. The Resident on hearing of this proceeding wrote to the Foreign Agent to say that if this had been done in the interests of the creditors generally, he had no wish to interfere, but if in those of British subjects in particular, he had no desire that a Persian merchant should be put under restraint. The Foreign Agent replied that he had treated the bankrupt with every consideration; and that security had been accepted for the settlement of his debts. On the receipt of a communication from Hajee Nubbee Khan that the assets were not being distributed fairly, and that preference was being shown to certain wealthy merchants, the Resident again wrote to the Foreign Agent mentioning these facts and stating his belief that justice would be done and a reference to Tehran on his part be thus rendered unnecessary. 438. The Foreign Agent replied to the effect that though the bankrupt had several times expressed a wish to settle with Hajee Nubbee Khan, he had apparently changed his mind. 439. In the meantime Hajee Muhammad Baker had a conversation with the Resident (memorandum of which is given by Mr. Edwards) in which he appeared anxious that the Resident should induce Hajee Nubbee Khan to take in mortgage for two years certain landed property, viz., two houses and a ' Tlmcha ' belong ing to him (Muhammad Baker) on account of the claims : the mortgagees would, he added, have a lien on the property during this period, and if the debts were not liquidated at the end of it, would be entitled to appropriate it according to Muhammadan law. 440. The Resident informed the Foreign Agent of this visit, and added that he hoped the matter would be amicably settled, but did not wish any oppres sion to be exercised towards the bankrupt on account of the claims of British subjects. 441. No further communications passed on this point, and the reason for the interference of the Resident appears to have been the representation of Hajee Nubbee Khan that he received consignments from many British and British Indian subjects whose interests would be prejudiced if fraudulent distributions of assets could be made by Persian traders amongst whom these goods were circulated. 442. On 8th June 1871 the Foreign Agent reported that Hajee Nubbee Khan had applied to the Prince Governor of Fars, who had issued orders for the recovery of the claim. 443. On 14th July 1871 Hajee Nubbee Khan presented at the Residency a bond bearing the seal of the Foreign Agency and purporting to be the sale to him of certain landed property belonging to Hajee Muhammad Baker with a right of repurchase within two years. This document was registered in the Residency.128 444- Hajee Nubbee Khan stated that Hajee Muhammad Baker ' of his own accord wrote the title deed of the property,' and ' as the validity of such documents depends upon their having the seal of ' Lion and Sun, Hajee Muhammad Baker himself took the document to the Foreign Agent's office and had it signed with the glorious signature,' after it had been signed by the law officers and principal merchants. 445. On 23rd August 1873 Hajee Nubbee Khan represented that the term of grace had expired without the payment of the debt, and solicited the good offices of the Resident in procuring the transfer of the property to him. Some objec tions were raised by the Prince Governor and the Foreign _ Agent to the right of Hajee Nubbee Khan to British protection : these were satisfactorily answered, but nothing was settled on the plea that Hajee Muhammad Baker wished to go to law again. In May 1874 another petition from Hajee Nubbee Khan was forwarded to the Foreign Agent, who replied that he hoped to arrange the matter without referring the parties to law, and in June following the property was duly transferred to Hajee Nubbee Khan. 446. It remained in his hands till the 5th January 1875, when it was forcibly taken from him and given to Hajee Muhammad Baker. The circumstances under which this occurred are, that on 20th December 1874 Hajee Nubbee Khan sent a message to the Residency to the effect that the Foreign Agent had sent his servants to assist the relatives of Hajee Muhammad in taking forcible possession of his house, but that he, Hajee Nubbee Khan, had received a promise of support from the Prince Governor of Bushire. The Resident therefore did not think it necessary to move in the matter. Subsequently the Prince Governor ascertained that the Foreign Agent had misrepresented the case at Tehran ; he therefore telegraphed to the Sipah Salar in hopes of explaining the case. 447. On 4th January rumours reached the Residency that the Foreign Agent had again made preparations to seize Hajee Nubbee Khan's house. The Resident asked the Prince Governor to prevent anything being done without his knowledge; he was informed in reply that the Prince Governor had received no answer to his telegram, but wished the Resident to make the necessary representa tions. 448. In reply to a message from the Resident warning him against interfer ing in an arrangement effected by the authorities with the knowledge of the Residency, the Foreign Agent stated that he had acted under the orders of the Prince Governor of Fars and was now acting under orders from the Capital. The house was occupied directly after the messenger left. A formal protest was addressed by the Resident to the Foreign Agent, who replied giving an account of the circumstances of the case and stating that 'the imprisonment of Hajee Muhammad Hassan and the realization of Abdool Nubbee's claim were not settled through the Residency, but according to the orders of the Zil-us-Sultan. 449. With regard to the bill of sale he wrote— ' Muhammad Baker however tcld several Moollahs and merchants of this place before witnesses that he was forced (or obliged) to act in this matter as he had.' He added that certain evil-minded persons had persuaded the son of the Persian Governor of Bushire, then acting for his father, to confine Muhammad Baker and throw him and his family out of doors, the latter had therefore complained to the authorities at Tehran, and they had directed reparation to be made to him. 450. The Resident telegraphed to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran suggesting that the house should remain in the possession of its legal owner, Hajee Nubbee Khan, pending a full enquiry. Mr. Thomson replied enquiring what appointment Hajee Nubbee Khan held, and whether the local authorities were aware of his holding it, and whether, as stated, the Prince Governor had accepted a bribe from Hajee Nubbee Khan. 451. Mr. Thomson was informed by telegram, in reply, that Hajee Nubbee Khan was confidential agent for the Arab coast and had been so since January129 1872, and that the local authorities were informed of this appointment in September j873» that nothing beyond the ordinary commission fees had been paid to the Prince Governor and his subordinates. 452. On the 22nd January 1875 Colonel Ross addressed a letter on the whole case to Mr. Thomson, stating, with regard to the pressure put upon Muhammad Baker to sign the bill of sale, that whatever coercion had been used, must heve been employed by the Foreign Agent himself, but the latter in a letter to the Resident, dated 3rd June 1871, had distinctly denied that any oppression had been exercised towards Agha Muhammad Hassan, whose treatment seemed to be the ground for the statement that Muhammad Baker had signed the bill of sale under coercion. 453* This was further disproved by the evidence of the Assistant Resident and by a document obtained by Abboo Nubbee from the principal persons who were witnesses to the execution of the bond, to the effect that no compulsion had been used. 454* With regard to the charge of bribery, Colonel Ross explained that, though he could speak with confidence on such a subject, he believed that fees of some sort were given, but this ' is the invariable custom in this part of Persia when such transactions take place, and would scarcely be cited except for party purposes.' It may be noticed that Hajee Nubbee Khan stated that these fees amounted only to 10 or 12 tomans, while he gave the Foreign Agent himself 200 tomans. 455* Colonel Ross was of opinion that the injury to Hajee Nubbee Khan had been planned by the Foreign Agent deliberately ; he was well aware of the position the former held, and if he succeeded in his object, ' it is to be expected that parties in our employ will be made to suffer in property and position.' 456. The correspondence between the Resident in the Persian G l J and Political a., August 1876, Nos.35-41. ^ Majesty's Minister at Tehran on the subject resulted in the issue of an order, dated 24th March 1875, from the latter to the Persian Foreign Office Agent at Bushire, directing him to make over the house to its ' former owner.' The Foreign Office Agent however declined to act at once on this order pretend- ing ignorance as to whether the words ' former owner' applied to Hajee Muhammad Baker or to Hajee Abdool Nubbee. He therefore telegraphed to Tehran for precise orders on the point, and was of course informed in reply, dated 19th April, that the house was to be given to Hajee Abdool Nubbee. A correspondence on the subject then ensued between the Foregin Office Agent and the Assistant Resident, and it was not till the 21st of April that the claimant was placed in undisputed possession of his property ; and when he did proceed to take it over it was found that the delay caused by the Foreign Office Agent's reference to Tehran as to the meening of the words 'former owner' had been utilized to throw the house into a ruinous condition. The wooden fixtures such as doors and screens had been removed ; the verandahs had been demolished; and altogether damage to the extent of 730 krans worth had been committed. Further, the Foreign Office Agent when informing Hajee Abdool Nubbee of the order from Tehran gratuitously insulted him by hinting that his son associated with disreputable persons. He moreover encouraged the original owner, Hajee Muhammad Baker, and his family to make the house untenable by giving annoyance to any party when Hajee Abdool Nubbee might place therein. 457. Colonel Ross in reporting the above occurrences to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran remarked that the whole proceedings of the Foreign Agent had apparently been prompted by personal animosity towards Hajee Abdool Nubbee, and not by any wish to be offensive to the local British authorities. He how ever added that it was extremely desirable that the Foreign Office Agent should be given to understand that he must be more careful in his actions towards per sons under the protection of the British Government. Finally, Colonel Ross stated that it appeared to him appropriate that Mirza Muhammad Khan should be made to pay the value of the damage done to Hajee Abdool Nubbee's house by his instigation or with his connivance. S640FD13° (Ixxiij Ill-treatment of the wife of a British subject, native of India, by the Bushire Police, 1878. 458. In July 1878 the Resident forwarded copies of some correspondence which passed between him and the Gover- Poiiticai a., November 1878, Nos. 132-148. ^ Bushire relative to the ill-treatment of the wife of one of the Residency sowars bv the Bushire Police, and a letter which he addressed to Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran on the subject. 459. It appears that in the beginning of the month of July this woman was found alone outside the precincts of the Residency by some subordinates of the Police Darogha, arrested by them for some reason or other and carried off first to the Darogha's house and then to the house of one Dehbashee Kasim. On the way she was very roughly treated and two bracelets, which she valued at 270 krans, taken from her. Information was then conveyed to the Residency by one of the Darogha's men that a woman, who said that she was the wife of one of the Residency sowars, was in custody, and the Residency Ferrashbashee went to the Dehbashee's house and had her released. 460. The woman stated that she had gone to pray at the tomb of a friend of hers, and that the Darogha's men had there met her, and wished to extort money from her, and when she refused to give them anything, they beat her, took away her bracelets, and carried her to the Darogha's house. 461. The Residency Munshi was accordingly sent to the Governor of Bushire to procure the restoration of the bracelets and the punishment of the Darogha and his men. The bracelets were restored, but the Governor suggested that it would be better not to press the question of punishment. 462. The Residency Apothecary was then examined, and he deposed that the woman had received some severe bruises on her hand and side, and the evidence of two witnesses, who said that they had seen the woman arrested near the Jewish grave-yard beaten and dragged to the town, was also recorded. 463. After taking this evidence the Resident wrote to the Governor pointing out that the woman was a Saiyid of respectable family, and that the outrage was of a peculiarly brutal nature, and he added that the Darogha on several previous occasions had interfered with British subjects. He therefore demanded that the men who had actually committed the assault should be punished, and the Darogha dismissed, and requested that the Governor would report the case to the Moh- tamid-ul-Mulk if he did not feel able to settle the matter in this way. 464. To this the Governor replied that the woman had been arrested with a stranger in a suspicious place, and that she was released and her bracelets returned as soon as it was ascertained that she was connected with the Residency. He had moreover made enquiries from the witnesses of the occurrence, and it appeared from their statements that the Darogha and his men were not in fault. With regard to the statement, ' that the Darogha was constantly interfering with British subjects,' the Governor remarked that it was impossible to know who were British subjects, as no detailed list had ever been supplied him, and that no complaints of misconduct had ever been made against the Darogha by any of the Residency servants, but if the Resident thought that the town could do with out a Darogha he would dismiss him. 465. The Resident then wrote that the application for a list of British sub jects had been refused for good reasons, which were approved by the Shah's Ministers, and that in any case the woman's name would not have been specifi cally entered in the list as she was a purda nishin. The woman's statements had been substantiated by evidence, and if the Governor approved of the conduct of the Darogha and his subordinates there was nothing more to be said. If, on the other hand, he thought they were to blame, but objected to the punishment pro posed, the Resident would like to know what punishment he would suggest. 466. To this the Governor replied that in deference to the Resident's wishes he had dismissed the Darogha's man who was concerned in the matter.'3i 4^7* The Resident then proposed that the Darogha should pay the woman Ks. 50 compensation, and said that if this was done he would consider the matter settled. 4 468 j T0 this the Governor replied that though the result of the enquiry he had made completely exonerated the Darogha and his men from blame, he was willing, if the Resident would agree, to allow some third person to decide the case after an examination of the parties and the witnesses who were present, but that he would not punish the Darogha till some offence was proved against him. 469. This proposal was rejected by the Resident and the correspondence ended ; but a subsequent enquiry made by the Residency Munshi showed that none of the men concerned in the outrage had been dismissed, but that the man, who first reported the fact that the Ionian was in custody, had left of his own free will and gone to Kerbelah. 470. The Resident accordingly wrote to Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran recommending that the Governor should be removed from Bushire, and the Darogha and his subordinates punished, on the ground that even if the woman had laid herself open to suspicion there was no excuse for her detention after the Darogha had been informed who she was, and that as the Governor had accepted the conduct of his subordinates, and had made untrue statements about the punishment of the offenders, he should be held responsible, 471. The Resident was informed by the Government of India (No. 2092-P., dated 26th September 1878). His Excellency the Governor-General in Council was not sure, from the papers, whether the facts of the case, or the proceedings of the Governor^ made it necessary that he should have put so much pressure on the local authorities, or that the affair should have been discussed in so uncom promising a tone. And by assuming that the Charge d'Affaires at Tehran would see in this case an additional necessity for the Governor's removal, he appeared to be attaching to it somewhat excessive importance. Nor was it altogether plain why the offer made by the Governor to allow some third person to hear and dispose of the case was not accepted by the Resident. 472. As a result, however, of representations made at Tehran, satisfaction was given by inflicting chastisement on the policeman who maltreated. 473. In his letter, dated 15th April 1879, reporting the infliction of the chastisement, the Resident wrote to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires: — # 'The support you have accorded to me in this and other cases, and for which I tender my respectful thanks, has had a beneficial effect on the provincial and local authorities, who appear at present sincerely anxious to meet all reasonable demands.' The Government of India also expressed satisfaction at this state of things and expressed hopes that the Resident on his part would do all that was possible to reciprocate this favourable disposition (letter to the Resident, dated 16th May 1879). (Ixxiii) Outstanding claims of British merchants against Persian subjects, 1881-83. Political A., June 1879, Nos. 48-81. A., Political E., May 1883, N03.1-5. 474. The favourable disposition shown by the local authorities to satisfy British claims in 1879 does not appear to have been long maintained. In 1881, Colonel Ross represented to Government and the British Legation the general insecurity Political a ., July 1882, Nos. 5?-63. of trade in Persia on account of the a , Political E., December 1882, Nos. 243-25?. difficulty of getting the legitimate claims of British and British Indian merchants satisfied. The following cases are typical of the rest and are detailed in full below (Residency report, dated 4th August 1882). 474-A. In May 1879, Messrs, Gray, Paul and Co. brought a claim against Abdul Nabi for a large sum. The exact amount could not be given at the time, as there were outstanding accounts, goods not yet sold, etc., but the sum due eventually proved to be Krans 356,117, roughly ^I3,5 00 * This claim was at once brought to the notice of the Persian local authorities, and prompt action132 uro-ed, as Abdul Nabi was accused of fraud and a desire to make away with his property. The case was slightly complicated by Abdul Nabi being in part nership with a Turkish subject, Jassim -bin-Zaeed, but it was quickly shown that Abdul Nabi had cheated his partner and had possessed himself of almost all the goods and monies of the firm, and was, therefore, responsible for all but a small portion of the claim. A G othtusy cidl Court was assembled, and, influenced by the Governor of Bushire, effected a large compromise in favor of the debtor. The amount decreed by the Court was Krans 215)000, about ^8,000 j Abdui Nabi to pay half and as much of the other half as he owed Jassim. Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co. agreed to this award on the understanding with the Governor that the amount would be speedily forthcoming. 474-B. It was clearly the duty of the executive authority—in this case the Bushire Governor—to force Abdul N'abi to pay and to take steps to secure his property, and this course was unceasingly urged by the Resident, but the obstructive tactics, usual in Persia, were put in full force. Procrastination, ex cuses, and profitless discussions ensued. Abdul Nabi was occasionally imprisoned, and then set free again, presumably when he had satisfied temporarily the Governor private demands, but no attempt was ever made to niake him pay his just debt, and every opportunity was allowed him to surreptitiously make away with his property. In May 1880, one year having elapsed, the Governor's informed the Resident that he could not bring pressure upon Abdul Nabi as the Naib-es-Sultanah, the Shah's third and favorite son, had tele graphed to him not to do so, but to release Abul Nabi, who happened just then to be again under restraint. The Resident applied to the Prince Governor at Shiraz, under whom the Bushire Governor served, but he declined to inter fere on the plea that the Shahs' son was in question, and the Resident was obliged to appeal to Her Majestys' Minister at Tehran. After some difficulty Abdul Nabi's imprisonment was again obtained, but nothing further was done to make him pay, and in September the Governor informed the Resident he had requested the Ministers of State to relieve him from any further connection with the case, and he refued to have anything more to do with the matter. The only sums recovered during all this time was in the first six months, when Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co. -were permitted, with Abdul Nabi's consent, to sell certain European merchandise of his in Bushire and Shuster and keep the pro ceeds towards payment of their claim. 1 he amount thus realised was Krans 63,820. Shortly after this, notwithstanding the Resident's protest, Abdul Nabi was sent to Shiraz. It was alleged by orders from Tehran, and the case remained in abeyance for three months, 474-C. At the end of this time an officer was deputed by the Persian Foreign Office to proceed to Bushire to have the case quickly and satisfactorily settled. This officer, Mirza Musa Khan, arrived in Bushire in January 1881. It quickly appeared that, although deputed by the Foreign Office, he was a creature of the Naib-es-Sultanah's, whose object was not to cause a. just settlement of British claims, but to be an advocate for Abdul Nabi and assist him in evading payment. His first endeavour was to set aside the decision o{ the Commercial Court and summon a new packed Court. Her Majesty's Minister, however, obtained more stringent orders to him to have the case speedily settled on the basis of the former award. Musa Khan promised compliance and said he would settle the claim immediately. This promise he repeated several times, but did not fulfil, and about three months after arrival he declared Abdul Nabi could not now pay the claim in full unless time were granted. He admitted Abdul Nabi was originally quite able to pay, but alleged that the Bushire Governor had extorted so much in bribes from him and allowed him to dissi pate his property in other ways that he was now unable to pay in full. The amount taken by the Governor in bribes Musa Khan asserted to be Krans 32,000, and he held out hopes of having this sum recovered for the creditors. This hope was of course not fulfilled. Musa Khan remained about 15 months in Bushire and then returned to Tehran, having previously allowed Abdul Nabi to leave the country without any notice to the Resident, who would have protested against such a course. 474*0. The only practical result of Musa Khan's action all this time was that certain wool and cotton, which Abdul Nabi had shipped from Basrah1 33 S e m d a.rpS„d •«' &lt;■..[•' E..,i, „ d .rf.rf, be bif, k handed over at a valuation to Messrs. Grav Paul and Cn unrl i\t c and Co K V.Qr. h^A ( ra ' 1 'f ncl ^ 0 - and Messrs. Sassoon ana i^o.

He gave it as his opinion that unless this were done, and the case pressed to a strict settlement, British trade here would suffer, and others equally unscrupulous would adopt the same tactics. r Subsec l uent events would seem to show that this opinion was well founded, for not many months had elapsed when a Persian Armenian, named *ooktas Ess at, came to Bushire and immediately commenced an even more daring course of swindling the victims being another English firm, Messrs, Muir and Co. ^ This person had been the London Agent and accomplice of Abdul Nabi and was in constant correspondence with the latter. Unless encouraaed by the course of Abdul Nabi's case, and assured of protection, it is hi^hlv improbable he would have ventured to Bushire, for it had been repeatedlv pointed out to the authorities that a portion of Abdul Nabi's funds, about £ 1,000 or ;£ 1 ,200, was in this man's hands, and his arrival in Bushire was dulv i d J 0 / hem , With a su gg estlon that he sho uld be made clear accounts with Abdul Nabi and any sum due to the latter recovered for the creditors. No notice was taken of these suggestions. 474'H. In May 1881, Messrs. Muir and Co, lodged a complaint against this man, Sookias Caspar Essai, who was in their employ, of having swindled them of large amounts. The Resident, from experience of the Abdul Nabi case thought he would have more command of this case by bringing a criminal charge against Essai, and he immediately telegraphed to Her Majesty's Minister to have an order sent for his arrest, pending investigation. This was done and arrangements made for assembling a Court. This Court, consistino- of merchants nominated by the Resident and the Persian Foreign Office A?ent who was then Acting Governor, was assembled, and the case gone into. ^The hearing was not finished in one sitting, and finding the case was going against Essai, the Foreign Office Agent induced the merchants nominated by him to refuse to sit again. The same influences in the capital were brought to bear as in the Abdul Nabi case, and delay followed delay. The Court never met again, but the new Governor, who arrived in the meantime, stated he was satisfied of Essai's guilt. Auditors were then appointed by the Resident and Governor to examine the accounts. Large sums of cash were found to be S640FD134 deficient as well as other swindles. (The eventual money claim against Essai turned out to be ^4,'3-&gt;2-7-) Es s ai wa f s kfP 1 ln confinement, and the Governor was ur^ed to make him account for the sums embezzled. In th.s case however, except a horse which was added to the Governor s stud, there were no visible assets, and though it was impossible Essai could have spent, in such a short time, the actual cash extracted, yet not a penny was recovered for Messrs. Muir and Co. In May 1882, Essai was allowed to escape, and his whereabouts is unknown. 474-I.

The great defect of their constitution was that they lacked the power to enforce their decisions, which often remained a dead-letter by reason of irregular appeals made by aggrieved defendants to influential persons at the capital. To obviate these miscarriages of justice, Mr. Ronald Thomson proposed$ m l 35 to the Persian Government that in case of claims arising from British subjects against Persians, a Mixed Court of Merchants&gt; partly chosen by the local authori- ties and partly by the Resident, should be convened, that the Local Government should assist in enforcing the Court's decisions, that appeals from them should be allowed to the Court at Tehran only if the Local Governor saw that the application was well founded when Mr. Ronald Thomson to His Excellency Mirza Saeed Khan, dated 22nd September 1881.) 474-K. Orders were issued by the Persian Government to Zil-es-Sultan /Wei, Nos.63. a /view to 11 forming such tribunals for the immediate settlement and carrying: out such matters. * 475- # Again^ we find in^ 1883 the Resident (Colonel Ross) complaining of outstanding claims in three important cases and dilatory and evasive methods pursued by the Persian authorities (Resident's No. 11, dated 22nd January 1S83, to Mr. R. Thomson). 475'A. In the first case, Messrs. Muir and Co. versus Muhammad Riza Waris. It seemed clear that the Shiraz authorities, so far from endeavouring to obtain an equitable settlement of the claim, were only desirous of assisting the debtor to evade, as much as possible, the payment of his just debt. 476. In the second case, Messrs. D. Sassoon &amp; Co. versus estate of late Hajee Saiyid Muhammad Baker Jenab, it will be seen that six months elapsed while the case was bandied about between Shiraz and Ispahan without any result. 477. The third claim, that of Banamull versus Saiyid Muhammad Baker, was for a lesser amount. In it the British Agent was put off with promises of an arrangement for six months, and was then informed that the debtor is a pauper and has escaped. Memorandum of the above three cases* 1.—Messrs. Muir &amp; Co. versus Muhammad Reza Waris. _ 478. A claim for Krans 20,146-10 was preferred in August 1881 by Messrs. Muir and Co. versus Muhammad Reza Waris, the Bushire Agent of Haji Muhammad Mohsin. Of this claim, Krans 7,913-50 were recovered by the late Governor of Bushire, who then allowed the debtor to leave Bushire and go up to Ispahan to recover certain claims he had against his principal Haji Muhammad Mohsin. The late Governor declared he had communicated details of the claim to His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, so that when the settlement between Haji Muhammad Mohsin and Muhammad Reza Waris took place, Messrs. Muir and Co.'s claim could also be arranged for. 479. As no result ensued, the Resident forwarded, in June 1882, a copy of the correspondence on the subject of the claim to Her Majesty's Minister in Tehran, with a suggestion that a representation of the matter to the Ispahan authorities might succeed in recovering the balance due. 480. Her Majesty's Minister replied, July 29th, that His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan had informed him that the debtor had left Ispahan, but that he had sent an order to the Sahib Dewan to have the claim settled in Shiraz. Her Majesty's Minister further stated that he had sent full instructions to the British Agent, Shiraz, together with a copy of His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan's order. 480-A. To this the British Agent, Shiraz, replied, 18th August 1882, that the Sahib Dewan had summoned Muhammad Reza Waris, who declared he had paid Tomans 1,000 to Messrs. Muir and Co., and Tomans 500 to the late Governor of Bushire, Mustowfi Nizam. The Sahib Dewan therefore said that as Tomans 500 had been paid to the Bushire Governor, the matter was difficult and thei3 6 debtor should either return to Ispahan to settle the matter with Messrs. Muir and Co.'s Agent, or his principal Haji Muhammad Mohsin should settle it there. 481. Further communication with Her Majesty's Minister elicited stricter order from His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan to the Sahib Dewan to have the claim recovered. These orders were sent to the Shiraz Agent by the Resi dent, 27th November 1882, and report of result called for. 482. The Shiraz Agent reported to Her Majesty's Minister, 19th December, that the Sahib Dewan had decided that Muhammad Reza Waris should return to Bushire and there settle his claim. He also forwarded copy of a letter from the Sahib Dewan, dated 7th Janu ary 1883, saying that Muhammad Reza Waris had no property, but that if Messrs. Muir and Co. would forego 75 per cent, of their claim, something might possibly be obtained from his relatives. At the same time this letter acknow ledged that Muhammad Reza Waris received Tomans 1,750 from Haji Muham mad Mohsin, a sum more than sufficient to pay Messrs. Muir and Co.'s claim in full. The Sahib Dewan further desired the Shiraz Agent to inform the Resident confidentially that Muhammad Reza Waris had no property, but that out of regard for the Resident he would endeavour to obtain 4 or 500 tomans from his relatives, if Messrs. Muir and Co. would grant a receipt in full for the whole claim. On a reference being made to Messrs. Muir and Co., it appears that the debtor had himself offered Tomans 700 in return for an acquaintance in full, and that Messrs. Muir and Co.'s Shiraz Agent was of opinion he might agree to pay Tomans 800. 2.—Messrs. David Sassoon versus late Haji Saiyid Muhammad Jenab. 483. On 12th June 1882 Messrs. David Sassoon and Co.'s Bushire Agents wrote to the Resident that their principals had a claim against the late Saiyid Muhammad Baker Janab for Rs. 6,600, being an advance on eight chests of opium which were found to be unsaleable, and requested that this amount might be recovered from the deceased's effects in Shiraz (among which were the silver bars, value Rs. 6,600, actually sent by David Sassoon and Co.), and they would hand over the opium to any agents appointed for the purpose. 484. The Shiraz Agent was at once instructed to represent the matter to the Shiraz authorities with a view of having the claim settled. The Shiraz authorities replied, on 26th of June, that Haji Mirza Kerrim, in whose charge Saiyid Jenab's effects were, was ill, but that when he recovered a reply would be given. 485. On 3rd July, Haji Mirza Kerrim replied that he had no authority in the matter, and that the effects were sealed up in a godown. The Shiraz Agent was again instructed, 21st July, to press the Shiraz authorities for a settlement. As no reply was sent, these instructions were again repeated on the 7th September and an early report requested. On the Tsth September the Shiraz Agent reported that the Sahib Dewan declined to issue orders on the matter on the ground that the proper executor of the deceased was in Ispahan and thus out of his jurisdiction. A copy of the correspondence on the case was then sent to the British Agent in Ispahan, with a request to afford his good offices in having the claim settled there by the authorities. 486. The Ispahan Agent replied, 23rd October, that he had written to the Prince Governor asking him to take the necessary steps towards settling the claim, and that His Royal Highness had replied that he had sent telegraphic orders to Shiraz to settle the claim as it appeared that the money belonging to the deceased was still there. Copy of this letter was sent to the Shiraz Agent with directions to report result of this order. 487. The Shiraz Agent forwarded copy of a letter from the Sahib Dewan, dated 7th January 1883, in which he states that the deceased's property was in Haji Mirza Kerrim s hands in sequestration, under orders from His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, and that orders for payment of Messrs. Sassoon and Co. s claim must be issued by the deceased's heirs in Ispahan before the claim can be settled. The claim was therefore pending receipt of such orders.*37 3.—Banamull versus Saiyid Muhammad Baker. 0 , n . the i 2 ^ th .J urie l882 .

Eanamull aeain petitioned the Resident, 26th September, on the su ject, but stated his claim was^ only for 200 tomans, as 200 tomans of the original bond had been pre^ously paid. Copy of this petition was sent to the British Agent, bhiraz, in reference, with instructions to press for an early settle- ment and to report the result. The Shiraz Agent replied on the 23rd October that Saivid Muhammad had been tor some time a prisoner in the house of the Begler'Begee. and arrange- ments were being made for payment of his debts, but that he had lately escaped and taken sanctuary in the Musjid-i-Now, and that the authorities declared nothing could be done towards a settlement of his claims until he came out of sanctuary. The Shiraz Agent was instructed, 30th October, to continue to press the case. r 490. On 20th November Shiraz Agent replied that the Sahib Dewan stated that Saiyid Muhammad was also indebted to Persian subjects, and that a little patience was necessary; that after the.!3th Moharram (25th November) the debtor would be induced to leave the sanctuary when arrangements would be made for the recovery of the Persian claims, when Banamull's claim would also be duly recovered. 491. The Shiraz Agent now forwarded copy of a letter from the Sahib Dewan, dated 7th January 1883, in which he stated that the debtor has escaped, and that he had not a ' Dinar's ' worth of property. (ixxiv) Conversion to Islam of a Hindu Fakir at Bandar Abbas, 1885. 492. In February 1885 a Hindu dervish named Motiram absconded from the External a., May 1885,Nos. 107-122. Hindu quarters at Bandar Abbas and it was alleged that he had stolen several artiV cles of jewelry and some cash. A complaint was made by the Baniahs to the Foreign Office Agent at Bandar Abbas, who referred the matter to Mirza Nasrullah, who was apparently acting for the Deputy Governor Mirza Muhammad Hasan Khan. The Baniahs insisted on the latter to have a search made for the missing man and to produce him. But there was much delay, and when the man made his appearance it was found that he had been circumcised and declared himself a Muhammadan. 493. There was considerable excitement among the Hindus, who closed their shops to show their indignation and made loud complaints against the pro- ceedings of Mirza Nasrullah Khan. 494. The Resident caused the convert to be brought to Bushire to be tried. The Hindus accused the man of having stolen money and valuables from their temple with the connivance of the locum tenens of the Deputy Governor and the Daragha named Cumbar. There was no sufficient proof of the alleged crime to convict the accused according to British law, but there were, in the opinion of the Resident, strong grounds for suspicion. 495. As regards the act of conversion the Resident thought that the local authorities had acted with indecent haste and improper secrecy. The convert, however, alleged that he was moved by religious zeal only. 496. The Deputy Governor Mirza Muhammad Khan promised to remove his man Nasrullah and deposed the Darogha and concurred with the Resident that the convert should not be allowed to return to Bandar Abbas. 497. Soon after Muhammad Hassan Khan resigned his posts of Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas and Lingah and Customs Commissioner and was succeeded by Muhammad Hussain Mirza. S640FD138 (Ixxv) Complaints preferred by British Indian subjects and people belonging to Bahrein and Ras-el-Khyma against Persian authorities cf Luristan and Bandar Abbas, 1892-94. 498. We shall give below some instances of claims of British subjects and subjects of Bahrein and Trucial Chiefs External a., February 1894, Nos. i -8. against the Persian Government, showing the procedure adopted by the British officials and the tactics of delay and obstructiveuess pursued by the Persian officials. Complaint against the B kni M alik tribe on the coast under the administration of F ath A li K han, Begler Begi of Lar is tan. Case of E sa bin H amada, a subject of the Chief of Bahrein. 499. On the night of the 22nd June 1892, Esa bin Hamada of Bahrein, nakhoda of a boat belonging to Ibrahim bin Hassan of Bahrein, was at anchor in the boat in the roadstead of Tibbin,* • On the coast somewhere near Naband. ^ a dependency of KaS r Kunar, in the district of Gaobandi, under Fath Ali Khan, Begler Begi of Laristan. The boat was attacked at night by 11 robbers, reported to have been of the Beni Malik tribe, who seized and bound Esa bin Hamada, stabbed a passenger on board, afid carried off R 800 in cash with other property valued at R 80. 500. The nakhoda and owner of the boat made a formal complaint before the Kazi and the Chief of Bahrein. The Chief forwarded it to the Resident, who on the 5th August 1892 informed the British Agent at Shlraz, and requested him to move the Governor of Fars to obtain redress. His Royal Highness the Rukn-ud-Daula (then Governor-General of Fars) sent an order on the 13th August 189a to Fath Ali Khan of Laristan, directing him to trace the robbers and recover the stolen property. 501. In October 1892 the Resident reminded the Government of Fars through the British Agent at Shiraz, and in reply was informed that a special messenger would be sent on the subject to the Begler Begi of Lar. 502. Nothing further was heard or done till the beginning of July 1893, „ , .. „ „ when a somewhat f similar outrage, com- t Case of Ah bin Darwish. Note E. j i &gt;1 t -&gt; • i \/r r 1 * 'u mitted by the Bern Malik tribe upon another Bahrein boat wrecked off Blsatin on the Laristan coast, was brought to notice. The Officiating Resident (Major Sadler) wrote about that case and also the Tibbin case, to the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Fars. The latter replied on the 23rd July 1893, saying that., although both the cases referred to had occurred in the time of His Royal Highness the Rukn-ud-Daula, he had ordered Fath Ali Khan of Lar to punish the offenders and obtain compensation. 503. On the 4th September 1893 the Officiating Resident (Mr. Crawford) telegraphed to the British Agent at Shiraz to find out how these cases stood. Thereupon (9th September) the INizam-es-Sultaneh informed the British Agent, and wrote to the Resident, that he had sent Fath Ali Khan to Laristan with strict orders to enquire into the cases on the spot and settle them. Complaint against the B eni M alik tribe on the coast under the administration of F ath A li K han, Begler Begi of Laristan, Case of M a G hu- BIN -M uja, Hindu trader, a British Indian subject, living at Bahrein. 504. In September 1892 Maghu Banya went from Bahrein to the Persian 1 Lat. 27° n. • Lone. 32' e. coast for P ur P oses of t rad e- He Stopped ' at Naband,} on the coast of Laristan, in the house of Esa bin Saad, intending to take a boat from there to Bahrein. On the night of the 18th September, Esa bin Saad being absent, 15 men broke into the house, dragged Maghu out, beat and wounded him, and carried off his property, which consisted largely of pearls, and was valued at 26,479 krans (=Rio,592). 505. Maghu applied in vain for redress to Rustam Khan, son of Fath Ali Khan, Begler Begi of Laristan, who is his father's Deputy at Gaobandi, and also the Shaikh Ahmed Khan, Chief of Asalu, who replied that he knew the robbers, but had no power to recover the property from them. Maghu had- ■ V krans *39 cvcntu^Iy to leave in fear of his life and go to Lingah, where he comlained to the Residency Agent. r i 50 d * P, esi 4 enc y A g en t made enquiries and reported that the robbers were j auju 1 , a 1 5 T tr ^ e ' an ^ tliat the Naders were Abdulla bin Muhammad Rajab and Abdulla bin Haji Juma, the local Chiefs or Governors of Izbar and Asfieh respectively, subordinate directly to Rustam Khan and ultimately to Fath Ali Khan. Maghu also mentioned Shaikh Sagar of Thamini and Shaikh Ahmed Khan or Asalu as amongst the leaders. 5°7- 18th October 1892 the Resident (Colonel Talbot) telegraphed about this case to Her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, and suggested that a competent official should be sent from Shiraz to proceed to Naband in the Persian man-of-war Persepolis and obtain redress. Detailed accounts of the outrage were forwarded to Her Britannic Majesty's Minister with Colonel 1 albot s letters of the 21st and 29th October 1892. On the 27th October Her Bntanmc Majesty's Minister telegraphed to the Resident that the case had been referred by^ telegraph to the Government of Fars ' for a report with a view to further action' The Governor-General of Fars (His Royal Highness the Kukn-ud-Daula) replied that he had sent his ' Pishkhidmat' to ^aristan to the case and recover the property, and that he would again urge the Pishkhidmat' to recover the property from Rustam Khan, son of Fath Ali Khan. ^On the aist January 1893 Colonel Talbot forwarded to Her Britannic Majesty s Minister another petition for redress from Maghu, and brought to notice that delay of more than three months had occurred in the settlement of the case. On the 13th February 1893 Her Britannic Majesty's Minister telegraphed that telegraphic orders had been sent to the Governor-General of Fars to 'restore at once the property of Maghu.'' The British Agent at Shiraz reported that such orders were received by His Royal Highness the Rukn-ud-Daula, who there upon issued strict orders to his ' Pishkhidmat ' and to Fath All Khan of Laristan, directing that either the property or compensation should be at once produced. Soon afterwards Colonel Talbot had occasion to address Her Britannic Majesty's Minister about the case of another British Indian subject named Kishindass Marwarid, whose goods had been plundered by the Baharlus near Bandar Abbas, and suggested that, in order to avoid further delay, the Government of Fars should pay compensation at once and proceed to recover it afterwards from the guilty parties. His Excellency the Minister replied on the 25th March 1893 that he had been in communication with the present Governor-General of Fars, the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, about the cases of Kishendass Marwarid and Maghu, and had been assured that they should be settled as soon as the Nizam-es- Sultaneh arrived at Shiraz. 508. On the 17th May and 13th July 1893 ^ British Agent at Shiraz was directed by telegram to report what had been done in these cases. He replied on the 16th July that Fath Ali Khan, Begler Begi of Laristan, was then in Shiraz and would soon go to Lar, and that he had been instructed to recover the pro perty or pay compensation. 509. On the 9th September the British Agent forwarded a note from the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, saying that Fath Ali Khan had received strict orders in the matter, but that it would necessarily take him some time to get down to the sea coast and deal with the case of Maghu. Complaint against B aharlus and A rabs in the neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas. Case of K ishendass M arwarid. 510. At the end of November 1892 the Resident received complaints from British subjects at Bandar Abbas to the effect that a number of Arabs, under the leadership of Hussain Khan Baharlu and Reza Khan, had come to within 35 miles of Bandar Abbas and put a stop to all traffic. One British Indian subject, named Kishendass Marwarid, complained that the Baharlus and Arabs had robbed a caravan of his at Tang-i-Zindan on the way to Kerman, and carried off six loads of sugar and 2^ loads of candles. I M i ^ i f \140 511. The Resident telegraphed on the subject to Her Britannic Majesty's Minister on the 12th December and wrote on the 17th. On the 14th January the Minister replied that the Amin-es-Sultan had telegraphed to the Governor-General of Fars ' that the necessary steps should be taken for the capture of the perpetrators and the restoration of the stolen articles.' 512. On the 4th February however the British Agent at Shiraz reported that the Governor-General denied having received such orders, but promised to write about the case to the headmen of the Arabs and Baharlus. The British Agent anticipated that this would do no good, and that it would be difficult to recover the property. Under these circumstances the Resident on the 18th February 1893 suggested to Her Britannic Majesty's Minister that the value of the goods should be paid at once by the Government of Fars, and that the ques tion of its ultimate recovery should stand over for future settlement. To this His Excellency the Minister replied on the 25th March 1893 ^at he had been in communication with the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, the new Governor-General of Fars, and had been assured that it would be promptly settled. 513. In July and September the Resident enquired by telegram through the British Agent at Shiraz how this case stood. The Nizam-es-Sultaneh replied that Fath Ali Khan, Governor of Laristan, had received special orders to settle the case, but would necessarily need time to get to the sea coast. The Nizam-es-Sultaneh also observed that further information should be obtained through the Resident as to which Arabs were concerned in the robbery, when and where it occurred, and so on. Kishendass Marwarid has therefore been asked to furnish such details ; but it has never been doubted hitherto that the robbers were Arabs, who were plundering the country generally, and that the robbery occurred at Tang-i-Zindan (rather to the North of Minau near Bandar Abbas) in November 1892. Complaint against M uhammad H ussain B eg,/^ Governor of Bandar Abbas. Case of A li bin H ussain, a subject of the Trucial Chief of Ras-el-Khayma. 514. On the 27th February 1893 t ^ e Residency Agent at Shargah forwarded to the Resident a complaint from the Trucial Chief of Ras-el-Khayma to the following effect. 515. Ali bin Hussain, a native of the island of Zaab and a subject of the Chief of Ras-el-Khayma was the owner of a vessel. In January last at Rams on the Arab coast he took on board a man called Hussainoo and his servant as passengers for Bandar Abbas, When the ship arrived at Khor Khawair, Hussainoo complained that two hundred rupees had been taken from his box and that his servant was missing. Search was made for the money, but no trace of it was found, nor was there any suspicion of the servant having been made away with. The obvious inference was that the servant had stolen the money and disappeared. Hussainoo evidently thought so ; for it is on record that he went to Rams and Sham on the Arab coast in search of his servant, and at Rams informed his host, Abdul Azeez, that, while on a voyage to Bandar Abbas, his servant had robbed him of his money and disappeared at Khor Khawair, and that he (Hussainoo) was then hunting for the servant. 516. The vessel proceeded on the journey from Khor Khawair to Bandar Abbas, but was driven into Khasab (on the Arab coast) by stress of weather: here Hussainoo made a statement, which was recorded before the Chief of Khasab, exonerating Ali bin Hussain and his crew, and renouncing all claim against them in respect of the loss. When the weather cleared the ship put out again and reached Bandar Abbas. 517. At Bandar Abbas, Hussainoo, who appears to be a friend of the Muj- tahid there, lodged a complaint before the then Deputy Governor, Muhammad Hussain Beg, against Ali bin Hussain. The Deputy Governor thereupon beat Ali bin Hussain, imprisoned him for 15 days, sold the cargo of fish in his ship^ and conuscated the proceeds besides Rs. 200 in cash, which were made over toI4 1 the Mujtahid. On his release Ali bin Hussaln set sail for home, but was over taken by a boat at a short distance out. By order of the Deputy Governor he was taken back to Bandar Abbas, was detained there five days more, and was at last released through the good offices of one Kassim Allaf and upon payment of Rs. 16. 518. On the 3rd April 1893 above complaint was forwarded by the Resi dent (Colonel Talbot) to the Persian Foreign Office Agent at Bushire (Haji Mirza Abdulla Khan), who was asked to obtain redress for Ali bin Hussain, the subject of a frucial Chief under British protection, in the same way as the * This chief was fined by Colonel Talbot for Resident had lately obtained redress for a released^* a Persian which wa8 summaril y Persian subject from the Trucial Chief* of 1 , Um-el-Kawain. On the 15th May the Karguzar replied that he had ordered an enquiry ; and he enclosed an explana tion which he had received from the Deputy Governor, Muhammad Hussain Beg. This explanation was most unsatisfactory. The Deputy Governor first asserted that All bin Hussain was a Persian subject, and then in effect admitted the correctness of the complaints made by Ali bin Hussain, mz.— («) that he was detained at Bandar Abbas ; (^) that his money was seized ; and (^) that his cargo of fish was also seized and confiscated. The Deputy Governor justified his action on the ground that Hussainoo had laid information charging Hussain bin Ali with murder of the missing servant and the theft of Hussainoo's money. The explanation was forwarded to the Chief of Ras el-Khayma, who in reply refuted the Deputy Governor's claim to Ali bin Hussain as a Persian subject and showed that the cargo of fish in his ship was jointly owned by Ali bin Hussain and other inhabitants of the island of Zaab. 519. On the 19th September 1893, the Officiating Resident (Mr. Crawford) wrote fully to the Persian Foreign Office Agent about the case, and pointed out in particular— {a) that the Deputy Governor had practically admitted the truth of the complaint; {b) that the charge made by Hussainoo was manifestly opposed to avail able evidence and ordinary probabilities; (^) that, even if apparently true, the charge made by Hussainoo would not have justified the Deputy Governor in dealing directly, as he had done, with the subject of a Trucial Chief under British protection ; {d) that the money taken from Ali bin Hussain and the sale proceeds of his cargo should at least be restored to him and that he was also entitled to compensation; that the British Residency is prompt to obtain reparation for Persian subjects who are injured on the Arab coast, and is entitled to look for like protection to be afforded by the Persian Government to subjects of Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs, who moreover are in a position to retaliate for unredressed wrongs. 520. The Officiating Resident further observed that this same Deputy Gov ernor, Muhammad Hussain Beg, had acted in a similar violent manner before, vzz , in 1888, when he had seized Rs. 150 from a boat belonging to a subject of Ras-el- Khayma, which sum he had been compelled to restore through the Resident's intervention. The only reply received was that Muhammad Hussain Beg, who was a Shiraz, still denied the charges, and that the Saad-ul-Mulk was letting the cases stand over till the Karguzar of Bushire (Haji Mirza Abdulla Khan) visited Shiraz on leave. S640FD142 Complaint against the BENI M alik tribe on the coast under the administration of P ath A li K han, Begler Begi of Laristan. Case of A li bin D arwish, a subject of the Chief of Bahrein. £21• In April ^^93 Ah bin Dsrwish, a Bahrein subject, went in his ship from Bahrein to Tibbin on the Laristan coast, and, after taking a considerable cargo there, started to return to Bahrein in the middle of May. But he was caught in a storm, forced to put back to shore, and eventually his vessel was stranded off the village of Bisatin. Here it was plundered by the Bini Malik tribe, who carried off cargo and gear to the value of nearly 5,000 krans (=R. 2,000). Bisatin is said to be a village of the district of Gaobandi under Shaik Hasan bin Shaikh Mazkur, and subordinate to Path Ali Khan, Begler Begi of Laristan. The complaint of Ali bin Darwish was forwarded to the Residency by the Chief of Bahrein. 521. On the 13th July 1893 the Officiating Resident (Major Sadler) repre sented the case to the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Pars, and requested that prompt measures might be taken to punish the robbers, recover the property plundered, and compensate the owners. In the same letter mention was made of the earlier Tibbin case of Esa bin Hamada against the Beni Malik. So far as correspondence between the Resi dent and the Nizam-es-Sultaneh is concerned, the further history of this case will be found in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the note on the Tibbin case. 522. On the 12th July 1893 the Officiating Resident also telegraphed as follows to Her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran with special reference to the case of Ali bin Darwish :— Another case occurred. Bahrein boat attacked after stranding in jurisdiction of Governor of Lar by Beni Malik. Property stolen valued nearly 5,000 krans. I request that Governor-General of Pars may be directed to take prompt measures in matter. He has been addressed by me. In consequence, it would seem, of this telegram, and the representations of Her Britannic Majesty's Minister, the Sadr Azam telegraphed to the Saad-ul-Mulk, Governor of Fars and of the ports on the coasts, directing him to act in conjunction with the Resident for the restoration of the goods plundered by the Bani Malik from a wrecked British India vessel.' 523. On the 17th July 1892 the Saad-ul-Mulk replied to the Sadr Azam in a telegram of which the translation is as follows:— ' I have received Your Excellency's telegram regarding the wreck of a British beat about which a representation was made to Your Excellency. As however the particular port where the accident took place was not mentioned, I telegraphed the original telegram to Haji Mirza Abdulla Khan, Karguzar of Bushire, and in conformity with Your Excellency's orders urged upon him the necessity of having the goods plundered from the boat restored with the cognizance of the Residency if they belong to British subjects. I have also asked him to report the circumstances of the case for Your Excellency's information.' Complaint against K halfan B in A hmed K uxn , a subordinate of the Chief of Asalu {near Cape Naband) on the coast of Laristan. Cass of S ultan bin K asim al H owli of Bahrein. 524. Early In September last a vessel belonging to Sultan bin Kasim al Howli went from Bahrein to the Persian coast for trading purposes. Owing to bad weather the vessel had to put into the port of Bistano. While the vessel was at anchor there on the 7th September 1893, it was boarded and captured by one Khalfan bin Ahmed Khalfan, a dependent of the Chief of Asalu (near Naband), who is a subordinate and deputy of Path Ali Khan, Begler Begi of Laristan. The robbers carried off the boat, which is valued at 3,000 krans, to Asalu, and also property in it valued at Rs. 850. 525. The owner of the boat at once complained to the Chief of Bahrein, who forwarded the complaint to the Resident. On the 21st October the British Agent at Shiraz was requested to bring the case to the notice of the Governor- General of Pars with a view to obtaining redress; and the British Agent*43 reports that the Deputy uovernor of Lar has been ordered to investigate and report on the matter. ^ On the 3rd November a telegram about the case was despatched by the Resident to Her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran as follows :— On 7th September last Khalfan bin Ahmed Khalfan, with 5° men, attacked and •This was the value of the vessel. The property Car ; ied off Bahrei n boat and anchored at Bistano is shown above was worth Rs. 850 more. on L&lt;a.ristan coast and property valued at 3,000 krans.* Khalfan is dependent of Shaikh of Asalu, subordinate to Governor of Lar. I have directed British Agent (at) Shiraz to represent (the) matter to (the) Nizam-es-Sultaneh. This makes fourth serious case oa Laristan coast/' 526. The owner of the boat belongs to the A1 Fakrah tribe, and used to live near A1 Bidda on the Katr coast, but subsequently settled at Bahrein under the protection of the Chief Esa bin All. 527. In the case of Maghu Bania, it was given out in January 1894 that the Secret a., June 1897. Nos. 45.65. P e ^ rls stolen were 'found, and they were delivered to him. But Maghu Bania con tended that the pearls had all been changed and pearls of inferior quality had been substituted for the original. He therefore submitted a claim for Rs. 14,681-12-0, after deducting the value of the pearls made over to him. ^ 528. The Persian officials in this and other cases employed as usual the tactics of delay and obstruction, resorted to the argument of their responsibility inter se, apd ' the extraordinary but at the same time the customary position of a repudiation of liability by those actually in authority in respect of the acts of their predecessors in office'.

But we entertain no doubt, on the facts as stated in the present correspondence, that the Persian officials have in a great number of cases been indefinite r '' S ' lg matters 4° a settlement, and we cannot regard with eqnanimity the reasonable demands? ' Which in 311 P robabilit y represent jnst and Your Lordship's Political despatch No. 133, dated the 23rd November 1899, intimated that the claim agamst the Persian Goyernmcnt for compensation to Mr. Graves would not be abandoned, though Her Majesty's Government were not then prepared to press the demand m view cf the depressed condition of the Persian finances. The recent ussuan loan has presumably placed the Persian Government in a better position to meet their liabilities, and there may now be no objection to the exercise of diplomatic pressure, with a view to the satisfaction of this and all other demands which are proved after proper investigation to be justly recoverable. We ; therefore, invite Her Maiestv's Government to consider the propriety of taking action to bring home to the Persian authorises as sense of their obligations, and of requiring from them a complete and speedy settlement ot the claims of which we now forward the particulars. 531. Two of the more pressing claims, (those of Messrs. Sassoon and Messrs. Lynch) were paid by the Persian Government, ^1,152-19-5 for Messrs. Sassoon and £ 1 14-5-9 f or Messrs, Lynch. The sum paid on account of the former was less than that claimed by them, as the Persian Government never pays interests on deferred payments. The British Legation did not like to press the claim further, as Messrs. Sassoon had made themselves liable to heavy fine under the Persian Law for importing ammunition. 53 2 * claims arising out of the Lingah bombardment and Graves' murder, it Secret E., April icjor, Nos. 11-13. was ^ci^ed to make subjects of separate negotiation. For settling the rest of the claims a Special Commissioner was deputed by the Shah's Government. 533. This Special Commissioner arrived at Bushire in April 1904, but it was Secret E., May 1902, Nos. 64-66. 50011 evident that he had neither the authority nor the power to enforce the settlement of the claims. 534. The cases of this failure were further explained by Colonel Kemball in Secret E., August 1902, Nos. 87-90. ^ter No. 9 -S. A., dated 18th June 1902, to His Majesty s Charge d'Affaires:— In Sir A. Hardinge's despatch to Lord Lansdowne, No. 84, dated nth May, which has recently passed through my hands, His Excellency refers to our long-standing claims in Bushire and to the fact that the mission of the Special Commissioner had proved, by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh's own admission, a failure, partly on account of the frequent changes in the Local Government, and partly because of the incapacity of the Commissioner himself who had been recalled two months ago to Tehran. S640FD146 I consider it advisable, therefore, to explain that in my opinion the failure of the mission above referred to had nothing whatever to do with the causes mentioned. I am confident that no other Commissioner, whatever his capacity might be, could have, under the circumstances and considering the nature of his instructions, done anything more than the Special Commissioner whose mission proved a failure. Neither can this failure be attributed to the frequent changes in the Local Government. Bushire, it is true, was after the departure of the Darya Begi left without a regular Governor for sometime, but His Excellency the Salar-i-Moazzem, the present Governor, has now been in Bushire for some months, and he could have been directed to assist the Special Commissioner if a real desire to bring about a settlement of our long-standing claims had existed. I have thought it as well to make the above observations, as I consider that the explanation given of the failure of the Special Commissioner's mission should not be allowed to pass un noticed. With regard to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh's statement that he had directed the new Karguzar to take up the cases in earnest, I am entirely sceptical as to the prospects of a speedy settlement by this means. As I have pointed out in a separate despatch, the new Karguzar, however capable an official he may be—and the Mohtisham-el-Vezareh is certainly a capable official—has not the authority requisite to bring about a settlement of even recent claims, and until his position with regard to the Governor is defined, it will be useless for us to refer any of cur long-standing claims to him. Many of these claims, as I have already pointed out, are in reality against the Persian Government itself, and it is clear that it will be useless to refer claims, such, for instance, as those which have arisen on account of goods stolen from the Customs years ago, to the present Karguzar or Governor for settlement. If the Persian Government merely wishes to satisfy itself by a fresh inquiry that the claims are just, then I see no objection to the present Karguzar conducting such an inquiry, but it should be clearly understood beforehand that the Persian Government accepts the responsibility for the payment of those claims which are proved to be just, taking its own measures subsequently to recover the amounts paid from the persons held to be responsible. (Ixxvii) Claim of Messrs. A. and T. Malcolm of Bushire, owing to withdrawal of concession granted to them by the Persian Government for working the oxide of iron (red ochre) mines in Ormuz, 1899. S3 8 - Messrs. A. and T. Malcolm, merchants at Bushire, obtained a con cession for the working of the oxide of iron (red ochre) mines in the island of Ormuz in the year 1897, and received, as is usual in such cases, a firman from the Persian Government, countersigned by His Majesty the Shah Mozaffer- ed-Din. Shortly after the acquisition of this firman the concessionaires took possession of their mining properties in the island, and commenced work on what appeared to be a very valuable monopoly. 539. Previous to the arrival of Messrs. Malcolm on the scene, the mines had been worked by the Moin-ut-Tujjar, a merchant well known in Southern Persia as a rwal of Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co. on the Karun river, where he has for years carried on business under the name of the Nasiri Company. It may be mentioned in this connection that the greater part of the opposition we have hitherto experienced on the Karun can be traced to the Nasiri Company, and indirectly therefore to the Moin-ut-Tujjar. This gentleman contested the rights of Messrs. Malcolm &amp; Co., obtained under a concession granted by Mozaf er-ed-Din Shah, and produced a document issued in the time of Nazr-ed-Din Shah, purporting to give him the monoploy of all mining rights for a long term of years. The Persian Government, without waiting to discuss the relative merits of the firmans and documents held by the two parties, and without reference to this Legation, seized the properties and transferred them to the Moin-ut-Tujjar. Messrs. Malcolm &amp; Co. at once protested and appealed to Her Majesty's Legation to protect them. 54°- The question at issue between the two parties was one of Persian law and custom, and turned on the right of the Persian Government to issue and cancel at their own will and pleasure, firmans granted to private individuals. 541. As both parties were willing to allow the question to be decided by the highest authority in the country, that is, by the Sadr-i-Azam, Mr. Hardinge, Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, agreed to transfer the case to his decision and to abide by his arbitration ; but insisted on the retransfer of the mines to Messrs.H7 Malcolm &amp; Co. before trial. The Sadr-i-Azam made no objection to this provi so , and the Moin-ut-rujjar withdrew from Ormuz on the arrival of the agents of Messrs. Malcolm in the island. 54 2 - The hearing of the case took place in Tehran, and the Amin-ed-Dowleh gave his decision on 22nd January 1898, in favour of the Moin-ut-Tuiiar, and ordered the withdrawal of Messrs. Malcolm from the island. He further gave orders by which all the expenses incurred by Messrs. Malcolm in Ormuz should be reimbursed, whilst all payments made to Persian officials and others in Tehran should be made good to them. 543. Within twenty-four hours of the receipt of this decision Mr. Hardin^e ordered the mines to be handed over to the Moin-ul-Tujjar, and submitted a list of payments made by Messrs. Malcolm to the officials in Tehran. 544* Messrs. Malcolm fortunately paid all monies by cheques, which bore the seals of the payees, so that there could be no question raised in regard to the actuality of the disbursements. 545-. Three hundred tomans were paid to the Mouavin-ed-Dowleh, the Bank Commissionaire, and nine thousand five hundred tomans to the ikbal-ud-Mulk for distribution to others, and it was this sum of 9,800 tomans which Mr. Hardinge called upon the Persian Government to transfer to him in accordance with the terms of the award. Constant references in regard to this refund were made to the Government, but with no response. 546. Having therefore entirely failed to obtain the execution of the award, Sir M. Durand asked Lord Salisbury to authorise him to inform the Persian Government that if the sum of 9,800 tomans (^1,960) was not paid within a month, the mines must be restored to Messrs. Malcolm, and compensation paid to them for losses incurred.149 CHAPTER IX. Certain miscellaneous affairs with regard to British relations with Persia. (Ixxviii) Disturbances on the Persian Littoral: Question of British interference, i860. 547* ^stter dated 4th January i860 to Sir H. Rawlinson (British Min« Volume iii-io8of i860. ister at Tehran), Captain Felix Jones report ed that strifes and disturbances had been rife along the coast of Pars, and threatened to spread further, carrying anarchy and confusion everywhere to the detriment of trade and peace. Captain Jones addressed a letter to Sultan Murad Mirza Ihsam-es-Sultaneh, Prince Governor of Fars, offering the co-operation of the British squadron to coerce the refractory tribes. 548. The Persian Government, however, evinced no disposition to accept the offer made by Captain Jones, having before them the trick played by the Russians in occupying the inland of Ashoor ; ^nd in carrying out their undertaking to repress the Turcoman disorders on the coast of the Caspian Sea : the Persian Government could not be expected to fall in with the Resident's suggestion. The best chance, therefore, Sir H. Rawlinson thought, of its realization would be in the conviction which would be forced on the mind of the Prince Governor of Fars during his intended tour through the Maritime districts, that without our co-operation peace and order could not be maintained, and in the recommenda tion in favour of that co-operation which he might thus be expected to send to Tehran. In the meantime Sir H. Rawlinson did not think it prudent to ex hibit any great urgency or interest in the matter (despatch to the Resident, dated 7th April i860). 549. The following Resolution was recorded by the Bombay Government on the proceeding (15th June i860):—* The Resident should be informed that his proceedings are approved, His Excellency Sir H. Rawlinson's letter of the 7th April clearly explains the views which at present actuate the Persian Government. These views are under all the circum stances natural, and it appears to this Government that the proper course for the Resident to pursue is to maintain his present vigilance to be always ready to afford aid for the pre servation of tranquillity among the littoral tribes, but not to press the policy which he ad vocates too keenly on the Persian authorities. The distrust of the Persian Government should be gradually allayed and the Hon'ble Governor in Council doubts not that a healthier feeling will eventually be engendered. (Ixxix) Desecration of the English burial ground at Bushire, 1862. 550. In May 1862, Captain Disbrowe, Assistant Political Resident at c Bushire, submitted to the Bombay Govern- oume -1030 i 3- ment copies of a letter addressed by him to Her Majesty's Minister at the Court of Persia and the Persian Agent for Foreign Affairs at Bu^hire, relative to the desecretion of the English burial ground at that place. In this correspondence Captain Disbrowe stated that although every reason able precaution had been adopted to prevent entry into the burial ground by the erection of walls around it, steps had been cut into the walls and broken glass arranged along them removed, the enclosure made use of for cultivation and the graves desecrated—the nature of the desecration however was not stated. 551. In reply Captain Disbrowe was informed that it would have been more satisfactory had he placed before Government a plain account of what he had to complain of; he was at the same time requested to state whether the employment of a paid watchman at the burial ground would prevent a repetition of the course of complaint. 552. On the 4th July 1867, Captain Disbrowe submitted transcript of a despatch recently received by him from Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, from S640FD15° which it was gathered that the Persian Government had sent instruction for the punishment of the perpetrators of the outrage. In a further letter^ dated the 8th October, Captain Disbrowe stated that notwithstanding the reluctance displayed by the local authorities at Bushire to afford satisfaction, he had been at last en abled through the support he received from Mr. Alison, to obtain the punishment of one of the individuals concerned in the outrage on the English burial ground, and that the punishment inflicted upon the party consisted in a fine of 33 Mahomed Shah Krans—a sum equivalent to the repair of the burial ground after the occur rence of the desecration. Captain Disbrowe further stated that although he had pressed the local authorities for punishment beyond the infliction of a simple fine, as the party alluded to had been an offender only in a minor degree, and as Mr. Alison deemed the reparation afforded to be sufficient, he had desisted from press ing the Bushire authorities further on the subject. Captain Disbrowe concluded however by stating that a fresh outrage had been committed, and that he possess ed no resource but to submit fresh complaints and fresh appeals. 553. On the 13th October, Captain Disbrowe in reply to the communication from the Bombay Government alluded to in paragraph 551, and stated that a watchman had been duly appointed to protect the burial ground, but that a fresh outrage had been committed, that the presence of a watchman could scarcely therefore be looked upon as a security against the repetition of insult, but that he trusted the representations he had addressed to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran would eventually produce the desired effect and cause respect to be shown to the graves of our officers and soldiers. Captain Disbrowe concluded by stating that the entertainment of a watchman over the graveyard involved for the present no extra charge to Her Majesty's Government, as his monthly salary was defrayed from ' Burial funds held in deposits in the Residency Treasury ; that these funds were collected from voluntary contributors immediately after the war ; and that the remaining ba lance amounted to 1 ,451 Mohamed Shah Krans, or a sum bordering upon 100 Bombay rupees. The proceedings reported in these two letters (8th and 13th October) were approved on the 2nd December 1862 and Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly, the Acting Resident, informed that Government felt assured that Mr. Alison would employ his best efforts to exact due reparation for the fresh outrage, and to secure the cemetery from similar insult in future. 554. Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly then addressed two communications to Gov ernment renewing the circumstances connected with the subject. The first dated the 13th January covered copy of a letter addressed by Captain Disbrowe in August 1862 to Mr. Alison at Tehran, reporting the fine inflicted on Aghayee, the trespasser in the cemetery, as also transcript of the reply of Her Majesty's Minister, intimating that under the circumstances stated by Captain Disbrowe and the assurance he (Mr. Alison) had received from the Persian Foreign Office there was no necessity for seeking further reparation. The second letter then submitted was a review of the whole proceedings in the case, and Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly thus stated the original causes of offence— (1) That the grave had been desecrated by defilement. (2) That the enclosure had been made use of for cultivation. 555- The Acting Resident (Colonel Pelly) stated that the Persian Agent for Foreign Affairs pleaded to Captan Disbrowe that 'the defilement was not human ' and this charge. Colonel Pelly observed, faded from the correspondence. With regard to the cultivation, the Persian Agent pleaded that the cultivator, Aghayee, was owner of a portion of the ground enclosed for the graveyard and had to pay rent for it to the Persian Government, and that in consequence he cultivated it. Under these circumstances the Acting President submitted that the proper course to have been followed was— (1) To obtain from the Persian Government sunnud for the occupation of the ground. (2) Compensation to the owner Aghayee.— *SI (3) ^ watch over the ground and a wall sufficiently hiVh to prevent in - trusion. _A watchman had already employed ; the wall was also high enough in the opinion of Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly and the sunnud and compensation, he sub mitted, were alone required to place the safety of the graveyard at Bushire on a satisfactory footing, 556. Representations were duly made to the Persian Government, with the result that the Foreign Minister issued orders to the Governor of Bushire, Mirza Mehdi Khan, to prevent any damage being done by planting trees on the spot in question. (Ixxx) Cases of infractions of treaty rights by Persian authorities. Restrictions on the Resident communicating with the Local Governors, 1868. 557. In 1867-68 Colonel Pelly (letters to the Bombay Government, No. Political A.,July 1868, Nos. 168-70. '33 j dated 4th November 1867, and No. 47. dated 23rd April 1868) submitted to the Bombay Government several complaints about infractions of treaty rights at Bushire, namely :— (i) The Bushire authorities had placed difficulties in the way of export ing mules to Abyssinia, notwithstanding Persian promise to afford every facilities for this purpose. (ii) More than 5 per cent, export duty had been demanded of a British subject exporting some horses, which were his property. (iii) An embargo had been placed on the exportation of grain. This in juriously affected British subjects, but it was relaxed in favour of Persians. (iv) A variety of very irritating vexations and two very serious outrages had been committed by the Bushire officials on British Residents, official and non-official. (v) The prohibition of British subjects from purchasing as building This subject is treated below, houses. Colonel Pelly also pointed out the difficulty he experienced in getting quick and easy redress of grievances inasmuch as there had been an order* of the Minis- „ T .. q - o r • .oc ter at Tehran to the effect that the Resi- ■ This was passed bj bir Kawlinson m 1800. , i ii • dent should communicate not with the Persian Local Governors, but with the Local Foreign Office agents at Bushire, No man had been appointed to the last post for four or five years. 558. The Government of India in writing to the British Minister at Tehran requested that he should insist on the adoption, by the Persian Government, of such measures as would secure our subjects in the unmolested engagement of all rights conferred on them by treaty and would prevent the local and provincial Governors from evading or ignoring the orders of the Central Government, The Government of India also thought that one of the main causes of the unsatisfac tory state of things was the restriction placed upon free communication between the Resident and the local provincial Governors, and suggested the expediency of removing restriction, if possible (Government of India letter No. 780, dated 20th July 1868). 559. Strong representations were then made to the Persian Government 0 IA . 0£ .. , Q with the result that the then Foreign 0.1 ica ,, jannary i 9, os. 17 i . Office Agent at Bushire was withdrawn and another (Mirza Mohamed Khan sent in his place), who gave assurances to Sir C. Alison that nothing would be left undone in his power to promote a better understanding than that which had for some time existed between Colonel Pelly and the Foreign Department Political A., July 1868, No. 172. il152 560. The Foreign Office in London also ordered that the restriction on the Resident communicating with the local Poimcai a., November 1 , 03.11511. Governors should be removed (Secretary of State's despatch to the Government of India dated 23rd October 1868), (Ixxxi) Right of British subjects to purchase and build houses in Persia. (?) Discussion of the question in 1866-68, 561. This question should be discussed in the light of Article 5 of the sepa rate compact (relative to commerce, etc.) referred to in Article X of the Treaty of Turkomanchai under the most favoured nation clause of the treaty of 1857 between Great Britain and Persia— A rticle 5. Seeing that, according to the existing usages in Persia, it is difficult for foreign sub jects to find houses, ware-rooms or proper places for the storage of their merchandize to let, it is permitted to Russian subjects in Persia not only to rent, but also to acquire, by every right of ownership, houses to dwell in, as well as ware-rooms and places in which to deposit their merchandize. The servants of the Persian Government shall not be allowed to enter by force the said houses, ware-rooms or places without having recourse, in case of necessity, to the authority of the Minister, or of the Charge d'Affaires, or of the Consul of Russia who shall depute an officer or dragoman to be present at the inspection of the house or of the merchandize. 562. Writing to Sir Charles Alison, Colonel Pelly in his letter, dated 16th _ . p, , 0 ,, ^ October 1866, stated that the Persian Political A., December i860, Nos. 65-66. .i • • 111 1 • • * t-. • • , authorities had been objecting to British merchants purchasing houses from the Persians, though he thought that the right was clearly accorded by the article quoted above. 563. When Sir Charles Alison represented the matter to the Shah's Gov- D , *• 1 A T m ne ™ ernment, the Persian Minister for Foreign Political A., Januaay 1867, Nos. 75-77- \ a • o • j m \ , &amp; Affairs (Mirza Said Khan) replied on nth November 1866:-— 4&lt; I have communicated to His Majesty Your Excellency's letter of 1st instant, and am instructed to reply as follows With regard to a house for dwelling in and ambars for placing bond fide mer cantile goods, which, in accordance with the treaty, was granted by this Government to the subjects of friendly powers, that agreement remains in force. But it is necessary that Your Excellency should inform the British Resident at Bushire and all British subjects that, so long as it is in their power to obtain a house or ambar in the way of hire, they are to hire them and in case difficulties occur, then they may obtain them as property, but only to the extent which shall suffice for dwelling in and for storing this mercantile goods, not beyond that amount. 564. The British Envoy forwarded this reply to the Resident observing that the right to build houses is not specified in the treaty, but that there was no doubt that Europeans had purchased grounds and built houses thereon. He thought that it was desirable that British subjects should endeavour in the first place to hire accommodation and if that be not possible to purchase a house (letter dated 12th November 1866). Politic! a., June .S67, No S . 1 25-.26. 5 6 5- The following opinion was expressed by Lord Stanley to Sir C. Alison (des patch No. 18, dated 4th April 1867) on the point :— I have had under my consideration, and have consulted the Law Adviser of the Crown upon the subject of the right of foreigners to purchase houses and stores in Persia, as referred to in your despatch No. 14 of the 4th of February last; and I have to state to you that, in the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, you will be clearly justified in insisting on the absolute and unqualified right of Her Majesty's subjects to purchase dwelling-houses, warehouses, and places of deposit for their merchandize in Persia. The Persian meaning of the word emplacements in the French translation of the 5th Article of the Commercial Treaty of Turkomanchai may probably extend to such premises as are known in this country as wharfs and yards, which you can easily ascertain.153 W l in ' s e r, 0r Fo f ei gn Affairs, in his note to you of the 2^ of December resne'^'nf tV' 6 ^ e .

In July 1867, hsweVer, the Persian Foreign Minister issued orders Political A., October 1867, No. 243. t ^ at n . 0 . ^H ^ed^ property should be Sold to . . the British subjects or subjects of other nations. This was explained by the Persian Foreign Office Agent at Bushire to mean that no houses, habitations or plain ground could be sold to British subjects or dependants or Persian subjects in British employ (Foreign Office Agent's letter to the Residency Munshi, dated 2nd August 1867). 567. The Bombay Government told the Resident to inform the Foreign Office Agent that the Persian orders were in violation of the terms of the treaty and could not accept them. Political a ., March 1868, Nos, 25 -26. ^ January 1868, the roreign Agent sent to the Resident the order passed by the Governor of Bushire :— The following is a list of British subjects and dependants for whom and in whose name the Law Court authorities should not, according to orders issued from Tejiran, seal or register the*' Seeghah ' for any deed of sale of land property, whether house, permanent dwelling, or plain ground, in the town or in the country :— The Resident.

It did not amount to an acknowledg ment of an undoubted Treaty right. [s64oi i, D]154 {it) Discussion of the question in 1874-77. 570. Towards the close of 1874 the firm of British merchants, Messrs. Political a ., September 1875, Nos. 166-195. Gray, Paul&amp; Co., purchased some land at Bushire on which to construct ware houses. The Foreign Office (Persian) Agent at Bushire, however, declined to recognize the validity of the transfer, or to register the deed of sale until the receipt of orders from the Persian Foreign Minister at head-quarters. Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. referred the matter to Colonel Ross, who in his turn pressed Mr. Thomson for the issue of the necessary instructions from the Persian Minister. 57!. Accordingly on the 18th May 1875 the necessary instructions were issued by the Persian Minister but the extent of the land purchased by the firm was rigidly defined and stringent orders w r ere issued that the limits should not be exceeded : and that, should the firm build over and above the dimensions thus specified, the local authorities at Bushire should prevent such buildin^ ore if necessary, pull down whatever might be built in excess. 572. So ended the matter as far as Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. were con- cerned. But on the 22nd May 1875 Mr. Thomson addressed the Foreign Minister with reference to a form of expression made use of in the issue of the above instructions, mz, } that they were issued _ 'by the Persian Ministers out of respect for the British Legation, and with a view to inendly co-operation which they deem necessary as far as possible.' Mr. Thomson, writing to the Minister on the 22nd May, drew his attention to the fact (which he had stated in a previous letter) that the right of construct ing the warehouses was based on Treaty stipulations, and that Her Majesty's Government had on a previous occasion instructed his predecessor, Mr. Alison to insist on the principle of the undoubted Treaty right of British subjects to acquire land for the purpose of building warehouses whenever any occasion might again arise for so doing. . . 573^ In reply to this letter the Foreign Minister urged that in no Treaty had the right of constructing buildings been guaranteed to the subjects of anv of the most favored nations, but # ' merely that as in former times it was difficult to rent warehouses in Persia, provision was made in the treaty regarding permission to purchase a site for warehouses.' He contended tha f the subjects of any friendly power have no right to purchase any other land beyond a site for habitation and warehouses when they are unable to secure the same by hire. 574. In reply, Mr. Thomson drew the Foreign Minister's attention to Articel V of the Ireaty of Turkomanchai with Russia and to the 12th Article of the Treaty of Pans (most favored nation clause) as showing that British subjects have the undoubted right of acquiring house and warehouse property in Persia, and he insisted on this principle—referring to the numerous cases in several parts of Persia where lands have been acquired and buiit upon bv foreicrn- ers, and expressing a hope that measures might be adopted such as would prevent hereafter a repetition of the '' vexatious discussion of this principle '. Here the correspondence ended. 575. In 1876, the Persian authorities at Bushire having declined without Political a.;iScT^N^^^It 205 - ^ rders from head-quarters to permit Messrs. ir 1 ■ /. » F aul and Co, to build a dwellino' house for accommodation of members of their firm outside a Bushire on a plot purchased by them for the purpose, Colonel Ross requested the intervention of the British Minister at Tehran on behalf of the fij The required Concession was granted after some demur. 4 ^uucession 576.

P He considered it inexpedient to raise point (3) noted above, but with reference to point (6) suggested than Mr. Thomson should be instructed ' to abstain from entering into any controversy with the Persian Minister for Foreign * Political September 1876, No. 43. Affairs on the subject of the conditions attached f cr 1 , , m Ins note * of the 6th June 1876, to the erection of the new office, and that he should neither admit nor contest the validity of those con- iticns. but confine himself to such steps as may be necessary to secure that the buildino- which is required for the comfort and health of the Telegraph staff, and which hal been a subject of correspondence tor more than three years, shall be erected and rendered nt for occupation with the least possible delay.' 580. Before the step suggested was taken Mr. Thomson informed the Home Government that he had addressed the Persian Government in the manner suggested by the Government of India. In reply Mr. Thomson was placed in possession of the views of the Home Government on the general points discussed and was at the same time informed that ' provided the new Telegraph Office at Bushire be leased to the Indian Government on reasonable terms that Government can have no object in desiring to acquire in perpetuity a building for which in I cse than 20 years they may have no further use.'156 581. In forwarding the correspondence to the Government of India, Lord Salisbury stated that it was at least doubtful whether the right to build houses could be claimed, that it was undesirable that the point should be made an occasion of controversy, and that it was satisfactory that the note suggested to Mr. Taylour Thomson by us should have been couched in such general terms that it might not elicit a rejoinder from the Persian Government. {Hi) Discussion of the question in 1882-8^. 582. The following important correspondence took place on the subject in Secret, April 1882, Nos. 334-336. 1883 and should be read Secret E., October 1882, No, 93. No, 334. No. 39, dated Tehran, 9th March 1882. From— Ronald F. Thomson, Esq., Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To - Earl Granville, K .G., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I have the honor to enclose translation of a circular note which has been addressed 2 th , nuar to the Foreign representatives by the Persian 1st MiTrch! 1 ^' Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the right of foreigners to hold real property in Persia, as well as a copy of my reply. Your Lordship will observe that Mirza Saeed Khan contests the right of foreigners to hold land, but I have replied that as for many years, subjects of foreign powers, especially Russians, have owned land in Azerbaijan and elsewhere without objection being raised by the Persian Government. British subjects, under the most favoured nation clause of the Treaty of 1857, could claim equal privileges, and that I theretore could not accept the conclusions arrived at by His Excellency, No. 335. Translation of a note from the Persian Ministe dated 8th Rabi-ul-Aroal I2gg-=z2gth January 1882. A faithful adherence to treaty stipulations between the high States is a duty incum bent upon both parties; it is clear that the Persian Government has been and is ready to carry out its own obligations to their fullest extent, and there is no doubt that, animated with a similar policy, the exalted Government which Your Excellency represents will also not permit the slightest oversight in the due observance of treaty rights. Owing, however, to a certain amount of carelessness which formerly took place on the part of ill-informed subjects of both States, the purport of the 5th Article of the Com&gt; mercial Ireaty of Furkomanchai, upon which are based the other treaties with friendly powers, and in which the rights of foreign subjects as regards holding landed property in Persia are fully defined, has been overstepped, thereby causing an infraction of the sover- eign rights of this country and of the rules of its internal organization. The Persian Foreign Department therefore having due regard to treaty rights, and v ith a view to the necessary removal of abuses, considers itself bound most respectfully to invite \our Excellency urgently to impress upon British subjects the necessity of confin ing themselves to the defined rights and limits which have been assigned to them, as in conformity with the above statement, the Persian Government will by treaty be fully entitled to treat any wrongful act which may have been committed in this respect, without its special sanction, as contrary to treaty rights. I hope that, consistently with the feelings of perfect nnanimity (existing between us),. Your nxcellency will kindly afford the necessary support in this matter, and that you will give me the pleasure of informing me that you have done so. No. 336. Dated Tehran, 1st March 1882. From— R onald T homson, Esq., Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran^ To— His Excellency Mirza Saeed Khan, Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's note of the 29th of January last (8th Rabi-ul-Awal), in which you inform me that foreign subjects have in- kinged the 5th Article of the Treaty of Turkomanchai which lays down the rules and157 limitations under which they can hold real property in this country. Your Excellency further invites me to call upon British subjects to confine themselves to the defined rights and limits which have been assigned to them, and adds that the Persian Government will be entitled to treat any irregularity which may have been committed in this respect, with out its special sanction, as contrary to treaty rights. Your Excellency will permit me to point out that for many years past foreign subjects have acquired and held landed property in many provinces of Persia, but notably in that of Azerbaijan. Now in the 12th Article of the Treaty of Paris of 1857, it is stated ' that the British Government requires, and the Persian Government engages that the same privileges and immunities shall in Persia be conferred upon, and shall be enjoyed by, the British Government, its servants and its subjects, and that the same respect and consi deration shall be shown for them and shall be enjoyed by them as are conferred upon and enjoyed by and shown to the most favored Foreign Government, its servants and its subject,' and in Article 9 it is stated that fi the treatment of their (the high contracting parties) respective subjects and their trade shall also in every respect be placed on the footing of the treatment of the subjects and commerce of the most favored nation.' From these two articles it is sufficiently clear that if the subjects of any foreign power have been allowed without interference or objections on the part of the Persian Govern ment to acquire landed property in Persia, a similar privilege cannot be withheld from British subjects. With regard to that part of Your Excellency's note in which you mention the 'special sanction ' without which the acqqisition of landed property by foreigners is illegal, I would beg to point out that the position taken up is untenable. Whatever the treaty rights of foreigners are, they are sacred, and the Persian Government cannot, at will, sanc tion an infringement of them. Taking my stand therefore on the treaty rights of Her Majesty's subjects, I cannot accept the conclusions drawn in Your Excellency's note now under reply. I avail, &amp;c , &amp;c. No, 150, dated Tehran, 24th|August 1882. From— R onald F. T homsok, Esq., Her Majesty's Minister at TeViran, To— E arl G ranville, K.G., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. With reference to the memorandum enclosed in Your Lordship's despatch No. 50 of the 10th May last, on the subject of the tenure of real property by foreigners in Persia, I have the honor to state that the treaty or agreement therein mentioned, to which the Persian Government have on various occasions appealed when endeavouring to limit the rights of the Europeans in this country in respect to the acquisition of house and landed property, was transmitted in translation to the Foreign Office by Sir Justin Sheil in his despatch No. 99 of the 1st of December 1843. Although not drawn up in the form of a treaty, this document contains 18 Articles or Regulations which were negotiated between the Persian Minister of that day and Count Medem, then Russian Representative at this Court, with the object of defining the measures to be adopted for the prevention of fraudulent bankruptcies in cases in which Russian sub jects were concerned. These were embodied in a firman which was then issued by the late Mahommed Shah, and Sir Justin Sheil reported his despatch No. 68 of the 22nd of . Sec AUchlWs Treaties, VoUune X, Pern., June . 844, that his demand 6rmans » s.m,lar No. XII, page 61. • to that granted to the Russian Minister, had been issued on behalf of British subjects. In Article s of this agreement it is stipulated as follows Whoever wishes to mort gage or sell real property must give over the title deeds to the buyer, and if he does not redeem his property at the appointed time he will forfeit it. The Divan Khaneh also, previous to authenticating a document of sale or purchase of this nature, must ascertain that the title deeds have been given over to the purchaser, and that the property has not previously been mortgaged or sold to some other person. The concluding paragraph of the supplementary article of this agreement ex P lai n s that villages are comprised in the real property to which the above article refers, and the right to hold property of this nature having thus been conceded to foreigners, undr Royal firman issued by the late Shah, the Persian Government can no ^nger be justified in attempting to limit that tenure to the acquisition, by purchase, of dwelling houses and warehouses, as stipulated in the 5th Article of the Treaty of Commerce of Turkomanchai. This concession completely disposes of the statement made by the Minister for For, ign Affairs in his letter to me of the .5th of March last that the Pers.an Government had never authorized the acquisition by foreigners of property of the nature of vdlaees or estates. There still remains, however, the question of the three condit.ons upon which it is alleged that the right of foreigners to acquire landed property depends. In the supplementary clause of the above agreement of 1843, it is stated that threi, parties have a S64OFD■58 right in landed property in Persia, namely, the crown, the proprietor and the cultivators of the soil, and that in case the proprietor should wish to mortgage his village in order to avoid dispute, he must previously obtain permission from the Royal Divan and the cultiva tors of the soil. This rule would appear to have been inserted more with a view to prevent dispute?, than with the object of making the legal transfer of landed property depend upon the fulfilment of the conditions named. The statement contained in this clause is, however, altogether erroneous. No such conditions have ever been observed in the transfer of property amongst natives, the law being that the owner of house or landed property is free to dispose, as he thinks fit, of all that legally belongs to him, without the permission of the sovereign being asked, or the villagers being consulted in the matter. The only formality required to establish the legality of the transaction is that the title deeds, or deed of transfer or mortgage, should be countersigned by one of the Moojteheds, or chief priests. These fraudulent bankruptcy regulations have now been in force since 1843, an d the conditions specified in the supplementary clause of that agreement in respect to the acquisition of real proj erty by foreigners have never been observed. In Azerbaijan, as well as in other parts of Persia, Russian subjects, mostly natives of Georgia and the Russian provinces on the Caspian, have acquired possession of villages and estates, without any question havino-been raised as to the fulfilment of these conditions; and British Indian subjects have also been allowed in like manner to own lands and villages, the lega'ity of their titles never having been called in question by the Persian authorities. The Persian Government do not apparently, therefore, propose that the application of the condition in question should be made retrospective ; and with regard to the future, it is extremely doubtful if the Russian Government would now permit any arrangement made by tkeir subjects with the owners of real property to be set aside, because it had not been autho rized by the Shah or by the cultivators of the soil. The Russian Charge d'Affaires has informed me that no reply was sent from his Legation to the circular addressed on this subject by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Foreign Representatives here, copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 39 of the 9th of March, it having been considered preferable to deal with individual cases which might require official intervention as they occurred. 584. In 1885, the Foreign Office Agent at Shiraz informed the British Agent Sect F.. Ma, .885, No.. 553-999. that orders had been issued by the Prime Minister that in accordance with the holy treaty, the subjects and dependents of friendly powers should not be owners of landed property, in the Persian territories, except under the permission and sanction of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, (Ixxxii) Alleged misconduct of certain inhabitants of the island of Kish or Kais. The claims of the Al-ali Arabs of Um-el-Kowein to certain interests in the island, 1880. 585. The island of Kais had been until the year 1879 under the Arab Sheikhs of Charak. About the year 1849, oppressive rule of Sheikh Mahomed bin Political a., January 1880, Nos. 231-237. Khalifa, then C hief of Bahrein, led to the emigration of several merchants of good standing from Bahrein, most of whom settled for a time at Lingah. Among others one Mashari bin Mahomed-el-Mashari, with others of his family, came toljngah and later on settled in El Kais, which island they gradually developed by collecting divers and importing goods direct from India for sale to the increased population. Since the murder of the late Sheikh of Lingah by Sheikh Yusuf (see Section XII), the whole of the coast districts to the north of Lingah had been the scene of complicated intrigue and confusion, and the island of Kais had first attracted the attention and then the cupidity of certain officials. The representative of the Mashari family, Mashari bin Abdul Latif, was probably chiefly aimed at by the Persian officials (see Colonel Ross's letter No. qq dated 20th December 1879). ' 586. In April 1879, the Persian Government complained to the Minister Political a ., March 1880, Nos. 12 a6. that certain British subjects, living in the island of Kish, harboured Persian refugees. Colonel Ross, however, showed that the only British subjects in the island were four Hindu banyas and khojahs, and their servants, that these men did not harbour any Persian refugees, and that they had been carefully warned against interfering in any political matters.iS9 587. Further, Colonel Ross, in a letter to Her Majesty's Minister, dated Political A., January 1880, Nos. 231-237, 20th December showed pretty clearly Persian Government to the Minister were by no means^orrect^burthat in 7 flct the complaint arose from a desire of the Persian officials to enhance the revenue ami'* 6 l, r 1 ' S a , n , . Colonel Ross was of opinion that the growing trade and cultivation would he inevitably checked, and that the island would fn a few years relapse into its former poor and unproductive condition^ tu- • 5 * 88 'f H p Ma i est 7' s . Mi n»ster then sent us a communication from the Persian Mmister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that certain of the Arab inhabitants of the island having misbehaved the Persian Government wished to punish them. They therefore begged that the British subjects residing there might be caused to remove to some other place for a few days, lest in the attack on the Arabs any accidental damage should be done to them. ^ 589. When the Sheikh of Um-el-Kewein heard of the Persian Government's desire to enhance the revenue of the island, he wrote to the British Agent at Shargah asking for permission to send across troops for the protection of the vested interests that belonged to the Al-ali tribe of Um-el-Kowein iointly with their brethren in Pars. The request was refused by the Resident. We might read the correspondence on the subject: Translation of a letter from Shaikh Ahmed bin Abdullah, Chief of UMin-el- Kawain, to British Agent, Arab Coast, dated i8th Mohurrum 1207—ist January 1880.

After some pre- monitory menaces, which, as usual, were utterly disregarded by the local authority, a mob consisting of several hundreds, of whom many were armed with guns, assembled close to the buildings, and' sending an ultimatum threatening death to all who resisted, rushed to the des truction of the bench marks of the recently completed longitude operations, closei6o to the main building. Resistance was out of the question, and the mob, after effecting the wreck of these marks, proceeded to the tidal observatory by the sear where they similarly destroyed the tidal level record. 1 he outrage which was instigated by the Saiyids was in pursuance of a vulgar superstition that these record marks had been the cause of the deficient rainfall. A certain number of ignorant villagers were caught and punished, but the ringleader Saiyids were permitted to evade all punishment, and the Governor showed no disposition to afford adequate redress for the gross outrage, affront, and danger which had been wantonly caused. It was only after his departure and the close of the year that the mutilated scientific records were formally replaced. ' (Ixxxiv) Outrage on the British Residency at Bushire (Sabzabad), August 1900. sol. On the 31st August 1900 a serious outrage was committed at the ^ ' British Residency at Sabzabad. In the Gulf Administration Report for 1900-01. m iddle of the night a party of men Secret E., January 1901. Nos. 30-38. surrounded the Residency and commenced a fusillade. The firing lasted only a few minutes, and fortunately occasioned no loss of life, although there must undoubtedly have been some narrow escapes, as the Residency and the servants' quarters were struck by bullets. One ot the horses belonging to the Resident's escort was killed. Strong protests were at once made, and the Darya Begi, who had reported to his Government that the outrage was committed by certain members of the Tangistam tribe,^ instigated by a merchant of Bushire, known as the Nazem -ut-Tujjar and a notorious intriguer, was ordered to lead an expedition against the Tangistanis. &lt;02, The expedition appears to have been conducted in accordance with the usual Persian methods. Having collected a large force from among the warlike tribes in the vicinity of Bushire, the Darya Begi set out against Tangistani. 1 he greater portion of the tribe appears to have submitted to him without delay, but he experienced a certain amount of opposition from some of the sections ot the tribe who were notorious for their bad conduct. This opposition was overcome without much difficulty, and having pillaged and laid waste the col J' tr y&gt; ^ Excellency returned to Bushire. Two or three of the Tangistanis were killed but most of those who were 'wanted' on account of their complicity in the attack on the Residency and other crimes managed to effect their escape into the neighbour ing hills, where a secure refuge may always be had. There is no doubt that the tribe had received a severe lesson, in proof of which might be noted the fact that the road through the Tan^istan district, which had been closed to caravans tor some time past owing to the lawlessness of the tribe, now became safe. (Ixxxv) Persian Passport Regulations, 1900-01. 593. On 1 st March 1900 the Persian External A., September 1900, Nos. 1-6.

As to foreigners Section 7 provides :— ' If foreign subjects who enter Persia have their passports duly 4 visaed ' by a Persian Consul or a Chancellor, the passport officials or the frontier officials are not to demand any navment from them, but if the passports of such travellers have not been visaed, it the traveller is a Turkish subject, a double fee shall be taken by the rule of reciprocity ; but it he be a subject of any other friendly power, a single fee (12 krans, but krans in case 0 labourers and artizans) from him and the passport visad. &lt;94. This regulation, it was pointed out by Captain Kemball, would cause much inconvenience to fakirs and others who came from India without passports and were unable to pay the tax. It was also pointed out that in case of Persian subjects, of whom a large number was taken as coolies to Basrah by Shipping Companies, the fee of two tomans each for each passport was too high, negotiations were therefore begun with the Persian Government for reducing the fee.i6i 595* New passport regulations were issued by the Persian Government in External a., August 1902, Nos.8-9. March 1901. Sir A. Hardinge objected to section 4, which provides that a foreign subject entering Persian territory without being provided with a passport by his Government would not be recognised as belonging to any of the friendly powers. 596. No reduction was made in the fee for passports for labourers in these passport regulations. S640FD'63 CHAPTER X.

(This was secured by the treaty of Turkomanchai.) (ii) That a refund of 1 per cent, be allowed when goods are not forwarded to the interior, but sold at the port of importation. (iii) That a duty of 3 per cent, be levied at the port of exportation on all Persian produce shipped by British merchants, if purchased at the port of exportation, the usual 5 per cent, being charged how ever if purchased in the interior. (iv) That in the event of the export of specie being interdicted such interdict should not affect specie, being the proceeds of goods already sold, or being the value of goods bona fide imported prior to date of interdict, and that in all ordinary cases a month's clear notice be allowed before enforcing such an interdict. (v) That a drawback of -f-ths be allowed on all goods re-exported from Persian ports. (vi) That no duties should be levied on goods transhipped in Persian harbours. (vii) That British subjects should be on an equal footing with those of Persia in regard to bankruptcy cases. (viii) That in the event of the Persian Government deeming it necessary to interdict the export of produce, the following provisions should be made :— lstly,—Ox\£ month's notice (as in Turkey) should be given to all concerned. 2ndly. —All produce the bond fide property of British merchants, and actually held by them at the seaport or inland at the time of the notification being received to be exempt from the prohibi tion. yrdly.—The British traders be permitted to carry out their engagements with vessels ordered to be chartered prior to receipt of noti fication. Or alternately two months' clear notice be adopted if practical difficulties should be anticipated on account of the difficulty of identifying the goods to be included under the exemption. (ix) That the agents and servants bond fide employed by^ British traders in their commercial pursuits should receive British protection. [This could be claimed under articles 9 and 12 of the treaty of Turkomanchai]. (x) That decision of Persian authorities in mercantile disputes between British and Persian subjects should not be carried into effect without the knowledge and consent of the British authorities. [This also could be claimed under article 10 of the treaty men tioned above and clause VII of the Separate Compact.] 604. In their despatch No. 79, dated^ 2nd June 1873, the Government of India suggested to the Secretary of State PoiitiCBi A., June 1873, Nos. 77 -58. ^at negotiations for modifying the com mercial treaty with Persia might be opened during the Shah's visit to London and that concerted action might be taken with the Russian Government. 605. Apparently no action was taken by the Home Government on these proposals in the direction suggested by Political A., February 1877. Nos. 50-56. . ^ Government 0 f ln dia. In I 876 a fresh agitation was started by the British merchants at Bushire and Messrs. Malcolm and Co. addressed a letter to the Resident with a view to a revision of the com mercial treaty with Persia, especially on the following points :— (i) That the duties be equalized all round and be fixed at 5 P 61 ' cen ^ once for all, as applicable to British merchants, and that a stop be put to the undue advantage allowed to Persian merchants.^5 (li) That a tariff of equitable valuation be framed for levy of ^ per cent, duty. (iii) That a provision be made for drawbacks. 606. The Government of India again addressed the Secretary of State on the subject. But Lord Salisbury was of opinion that it would be better to aim at the fulfilment of existing treaty conditions than at a revision, which would give no adequate security for the due execution of the new terms, at any rate until the question of consular jurisdiction was settled. His Lordship was at the same time sensible of maintaining on every occasion the rights conceded by the existing treaty._ Mr. Taylour Thomson had recently vigorously remonstrated against the imposition of the radhari tax on goods which had paid the 5 per cent, import duty, and the India Office had suggested the institution of a fixed tariff of valuation, a system of drawbacks and also of an official stamp, with the view of freeing from further taxation articles already subjected to 5 per cent, import duty (despatch from the Secretary of State, No. 104, dated 19th October 1876). 607. In regard to these proposals, Mr. Taylour Thomson anticipated many „ 1A .. Mrtc difficulties in inducing the Persian Govern- ju y , • • ment to adopt them. The radhari tax was, it was contended by Persian Ministers, a tax not on merchandise, but on beasts of burden carrying it, leviable from the muleteers. The Persians were labouring under the idea that the treaty of Turkomanchai, while favourable to foreign trade and merchants, had proved fatal to the manu facturing industry of the country, and in this opinion they were supported by Dr. Tholozan, the Shah's chief physician. The famine of 1871-72 and the failure for several successive years of the silk crops in Ghilan had impoverished the country, and the time was unpropitious for obtaining any concessions from the Shah. 608. In 1876 complaints were received about the levy of gate duties at 0 VT , Bushire on imported British merchandise Political A., March 1877, Not. which had already paid s per cent, duty, Radhari duty was still levied and strong remonstrances were made by the British Minister to the Persian Government, with the result that orders were given for the refund of the gate dues illegally levied. 609. In February 1877 a remittance of 118 krans was received by the Resident from the British Minister in part Political A., May 1877, Nos. 305-0 • liquidation of the gate duties illegally levied. The Resident in reporting this fact to the Government of India added that the exaction of these dues still continued, as well as rahdari duties on the road between Bushire and Shiraz. (Ixxxix) Evasion of Customs duties in Persia. Right of Persians to act as Agents for foreigners, 1876. 610. In October 1874 Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., merchants of Bushire, brought to the notice of the Resident— 41 The large increase of merchandise imported here by Persian subjects, who succeed in passino- the same under foreign treaty stipulations, on the plea that the said merchan dise ostensibly belongs to Indian subjects in Bombay, thus evading the higher customs ... on particular articles from them as subjects of the Shah. As a remedy for this state of things they suggested that none but British subjects, residing in the dominions of the Shah, should be considered entitled to the benefit of treaty stipulations as regards customs dues, 611. Colonel Ross, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, forwarded Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co.'s letter to the Political A., December 1874, No. 163. Government of India, and enquired whether Government would sanction his declining, as a rule, to recognise Persians as agents for British subjects at Bushire. 612. The Government of India answered Political A., December 1874, No. 165. ^e Resident's query in the negative. a The Governor -General in Council,' it was said, 'observes that our commercial relations with Persia are defined by the Treaty of 1857, in which no distinction is made between the goods of resident or non -resident British merchants. If the goods are bona jide S640FD166 British goods, they are entitled to the benefit of the treaty. If such goods are imported or exported through a Persian firm, it will rest with that firm to show that the goods are British. If the goods are shown to be British, and the benefits of the treaty are refused, you have the power to interfere on complaint being made, but you should not interfere unless you are satisfied that the goods are bond fide Lritish goods. 613. It was added that Government could not recommend that British merchants should be restricted as to the choice of the agency whom they may wish to employ ; and that it is not the province of the Government of India to devise means for protecting the Persian Custom House from frauds committed by subjects of the Shah. 614. Mr. Taylour Thomson then forwarded, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a despatch to the Earl of Derby forwarding a correspondence which he had with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the evasion of customs dues. The Minister stated in his letter that an order had been issued warning Persian merchants not to accept agencies from foreign merchants at the Persian ports and not to interfere with their goods or customs duty. The Minister asked Mr. Thomson to issue distinct instructions to British subjects. Mr. Thomson replied that specific charges and not general allegations were required to deal with cases of the nature alleged, and he promised that if any such cases were laid before the British consular officers on the spot, they would receive full and impartial consideration. Mr. Thomson went on to say that he could not admit the position assumed by the Persian Minister that British merchants might be interfered with m the selection of their Persian agents, and he suggested the expediency of not issuing the order containing the prohibition against Persian subjects acting as the agents of foreign merchants. 615. On the 28th April 1876 Captain Prideaux informed Mr. Taylour Thomson that under instructions from Political a., June 1876, Nos. i2i -37' Tehran, the Governor of Bushire had taken bonds from several Persian subjects not to act in future as agents to foreign merchants. Mr. Thomson having made representations to the Court at Tehran, orders were issued to the Governor of Bushire not to take such bonds and to return those which had been taken. The orders were duly complied with. (Ixc) Seizure by the Governor of Bushire of the wheat-cleaning machine of Messrs. Paul, Grey &amp; Co., 1878. 616. It appears from the correspondence of 1878 that the British India „ _ Steam Navigation Company was anxious Political A., 1878, Nos. 35-72. f • &amp; r 11 r \.u * l of arranging for a call of their steamers at Bandar Rig. But the Persian Government objected on the ground that the trade and revenues of Bushire would decrease thereby. The Persian Govern ment were in fact jealous of the rising importance of Bandar Rig and other ports to the north of Bushire and did their best in various ways to prevent the deve lopment of their trade, which they feared would be at the expense of that of Bushire. They levied, for instance, an extra duty at Bushire on their exports. In June 1878 the Governor of Bushire seized several wheat-cleaning machines which Messrs. Grey, Paul &amp; Co. had placed into boats for conveyance from Bushire to Bandar Rig. In seizing and carrying them ashore one of the machines was broken. 616A. Strong remonstrances were made at Tehran against these pro- „ , . . _ _. , ceedings, with the result that the machines Pohtical A., June 1879, Nos. i-S and 10-ai. &amp; ^ , were restored to their owners with 50 tomans as damages. (Ixci) Embargoes on export of corn. Excess duty on exports from Bandar Rig. Embargo in 1874. 617. We have seen above the great inconvenience and loss caused by the sudden embargo laid on export of corn by the Persian Government in 1871 {vide167 section V above). We shall give now a few of the instances in which embargoes were laid to the great detriment of the British interests and which evoked vehe- ment protests from British merchants and the British Minister at Tehran. 618. On 23rd December 1874 Colonel Ross telegraphed to Mr. Taylour Political A., May .875, N= s . .46.^.. Thomson that owing to failure of rains^ in bushire and the surrounding countries, the question of re-imposition of embargo on the export of grain was being mooted at Bushire. On the 23rd December a Sayyid proceeded on behalf of one of the Mujtahids of Bushire to certain British proteges and threatened them with riots should they export the grain they had brought several months previously, and for which they had chartered vessels. Notwithstanding the British Minister's protests and demand that at least the usual one month's notice should be given before enforcing the proposed embargo, an interdict was placed by the Persian Government on foreign exportation of grain from Bushire with only 15 days' notice. The British Minister, however, hoped to obtain favourable terms for Messrs. Malcolm and Co. who had a large quantity of grain on hand for exportation before the intentions of the Persian Government were known. Embargo on export of grain, iSyj. 619. The closing of the northern routes, consequent on the war in Europe Political a., August 1877, Nos. 319-52. in 1 877, had a noticeable effect in increas- Poiiticai a., October 1877, Nos. 497-517- ing the exports from Southern Persia by the Persian Gulf. The price of grain rose consequently and the mujtahids started a movement for stopping the export of grain. An order was actually issued by the Prince Governor of Fars early in the year 1877 prohibiting the export of grain. This order was soon afterwards rescinded, with the result however of exciting the Bushire mob into riotous proceeding, which were encouraged by a mullah and Agha Sayyed Suleiman. A boat loaded by Haji Mahomed Jaafer was plundered by a mob led by a Sayved, a brother of Sayyed Suleiman, and wheat to the value of 1,800 krans stolen or destroyed. Steps were taken to get the culprits punished. 61 9A. Soon afterwards the Prince Governor of Fars ordered another prohibition of export of grain with effect from 12th of June 1877. But as the British merchants would suffer if the prohibition came into force before the .5th August, Mr. T. Thomson obtained an order from the Shah's Government to defer the prohibition until that date. Export of grain illegally stopped at Bandar Abbas, 187 620. In March 1877 a British subject at Bandar Abbas, who had shipped a consignment of grain for exportation, was Political A., May 1877, os. 307 10. made to reland it by the Persian Governor under threat of a fine of 500 tomans. As no interdict against export of grain was in force at the time, Her Majesty's Minister brought to the notice of the Persian Minister this illegal proceeding, and demanded that the losses suffered by the British subjects should be made good to him. The Persian Minister thereupon wrote to the Governor— ' if possible you must try and satisfy the owners of the grain yourself, or else send me the details of the matter immediately by telegraph.' 621. What the result of this vague message was our records are silent on the point. Further restrictions on export of grain, 1878. 622 In Tune 1878 the Resident at Bushire at the instigation of some Political A., January .8 79 , No,. .05-70. British merchants addressed Her Majesty's Political A. Apni 1879, Nos. 104-19. Charge d Affaires at lenran to obtain the removal of the embargo imposed in 1877 and he added that the embargo merely enabled Persian officials to extort money from British subjects, and the exporta-168 tion of grain was unchecked. Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires accordingly induced the Persian Government to withdraw the embargo on the following con ditions :— (1) That the amount of grain exported monthly was to be reported to the Persian authorities and registered by them. (2) That 40 days' notice was to be given when it was intended again to prohibit the export. (3) That export was only to be allowed from Bushire, Bandar Abbas and Bandar Rig, and that no export would be allowed under any circumstances after the 40 days in the event of an embargo being again laid on the export. 623. The Governor of Bushire, however, supplemented these orders of the Shah's Government by a prohibition of his own that no more than 7 or 8,000 bags of corn were to be exported monthly. 624. When these restrictions were brought to the notice of Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Mr. R. Thomson, the latter wrote to the Moatemid-ul-Mulk, who replied that the Provincial Governor was better able to judge of the resources of his Province than anybody else and that the amount of grain (8,000 bags) which was permitted to be exported was not small. 625. The Charge d'Affaires then wrote saying that there were the following grounds of complaint against the Fars authorities:— (1) That they had illegally seized and detained Messrs. Paul, Gray and Company's wheat-cleaning machines. (2) That they had interfered with foreign trade without the sanction of the Supreme Government. (3) That they had illegally attempted to regulate the amount of grain to be exported. (4) That they had closed the port of Bandar Rig to British merchants. 626. On receipt _ of this letter, Moatemid-ul-Mulk issued orders to the Governor of Fars forbidding him to restrict the amount of grain exported and to prevent British merchants purchasing grain at Bandar Rig, provided they exported it via Bushire. 627. From further correspondence it was found that the export duty of 5 per cent, at Bandar Rig was a local import, which went into the pockets of the local chief ; that formerly this payment exempted the exporters from fresh pay ment of duty at Bushire in case the grain w^as brought there for export; that the new arrangement involved payment at Bushire of the duty formerly paid at Bandar Rig with the result that the farmer would benefit thereby, and the Shaik of Bandar Rig would try to make up for the loss by some other impost, which would practically put a stop to the export of grain from that place. 628. Further the Governor of Bushire, ignoring the orders from Tehran, again intimated to the Resident his intention of restricting the amount of grain exported by British merchants to 4,000 mans a month on the ground that there was scarcity in Bushire. Prohibition of export oj grain in j88g. 629. On the 22nd April 1889 the British Minister telegraphed to the Resi- Extemai a., j.me 1889, Nos. 52-61. d r ent ^ on account of scarcity the export of grain was prohibited from the south. The British merchants at Bushire protested against this prohibition without notice, stating that grain was plentiful and that they held considerable quantities. On the representation of the British Minister, Amin-uI-Mulk directed the Gov ernor of Bushire not to interfere with the export of grain purchased before the prohibitory order was issued.^o| 169 Local embargo on a consignment of sheep by a British, firm at Bushire. igof. 629 A. In August 1905 difficulties were placed by the local authorities at Secret E.,October 1905, No. 80. Bushire in the way of shipment to South r r • t , Afiicaby Messrs.

Representations having been made to Tehran an order Foreig^Office— 6 ^ ^ embar S c&gt; - Sir A - Har di'ge suggested to the _ ■'I believe the only way of putting a stop to the system bv which the local authorities in this country put an embargo for the purposes of blackmail would be to enact that no such embargo shall be allowed to be operative until it has been approved as necessary by the Ministry of Customs. rr j j 629B. Lord Lansdowne having approved this proposal, Mr. Grant Duff Secret E. ; December 1905, No. 348. addressed the Mushir-ed-Dowleh on the . . . ^subject on 21st September 1905, and was promised that the proposal would be placed before the Shah for orders (8th -October 1905). v (xcii) Levy of excess export duties, 1882-87. 630. On 2nd May 1882 the Resident telegraphed to the British Minister Political a„ June 1883, Nos. 101-103. t ^ e ^ ustom House official at Bushire insisted on exacting an additional 5 per cent, export duty on British goods which had already paid the full 5 per cent. at Bandar Mashur and Bandar Rig. * ^ Mr. Rdnald Thomson telegraphed back on 12th May that the Persian Gov ernment had given orders for immediate repayment of the export duty illegally exacted at Bushire and to prevent recurrence of such demands. ' I 631. On 31st May 18S2 the Resident wired to the British Minister to say Political a., July 1882, Nos. 144-50. ^ Goyeriw of Dilam stated that he had received orders not to grant receipts for duty levied on British goods; that at the same time he insisted on levying the 5 per cent, duty on exports, the result being that British merchants were subjected to an additional duty of 5 per cent, at Bushire. 632. In 1884 we find again complaints made about an attempt of the Persian I authorities to levy dues on goods exported A- ^ olH ' e ' by British merchants in excess of the 5 [Ses Piecis in the latter collection.] per cent, customs duty stipulated by treaty! 633. Colonel Ross telegraphed on 8th April 1884 to Her Majesty's No. io„datedsth April 1884. Minister at Tehran, complaining that orders had been issued by the Khans of the minor grain-exporting ports in the Persian Gulf to levy export dutv ^ on grain under some other name, and to discontinue granting the receipts which had hitherto been accepted in lieu of duty at Bushire. The gate-keeper at \ Bushire had received similar orders, and had already acted upon them. The \ orders came direct from Tehran, and were to the effect that the extra dues were to be levied on the carriers of the goods and not on the merchants themselves. Of course the buyers of the grain were bound in self-defence to reimburse the carriers, who would otherwise have refused to convey their goods in- future. Messrs. Muir &amp; Co., British grain merchants, had presented receipts for duty paid at the minor ports of Rig and Dilam, the recognition of which had been refused by the Bushire customs authorities. 634. Mr. Thomson informed Colonel Ross by telegraph that the matter . . o had been referred to the Persian Foreign nth pni i 84. Office for settlement. 635. Mr. Thomson wrote to Colonel Ross explaining that the attempt to oo exact double duties arose from the lately- No. 8, dated 19th Apni 1 4. adopted system of farming the whole cus toms of Persia to one person, who claimed that all customs hitherto paid at the minor ports of Rig and Dilam to the local chiefs should be paid to him. This S640FD170 claim had been recognized by the Persian Government, who had instructed the Superintendent of Customs at Fars to appoint agents at the minor ports to receive the regular 5 per cent, duty and issue permits to be accepted in lieu of duty by the customs officials at Bushire. Mr. Thomson added that he was pressing the Persian Government to issue orders prohibiting the levy of the double duty in the indirect form referred to by Colonel Ross. 636. On the 25th of April a despatch was received from Colonel Ross From Colonel Ross, No. 34, dated 14th April giving the details of the illegal exactions ,884 ' referred to in his telegrams of the 8th and 10th April, These exactions took place in the following modes :— /$/.-—By the refusal of the Bushire authorities to recognize the receipts given at the minor ports for duty paid there, which, in the case of Messrs. Muir &amp; Co., amounted to the re-imposition of a sum of about £ 70. 2nd. —By the levy of duty at the minor ports and at the gates of Bushire for which all receipts were refused. 3rd. —By the levy of duty in an indirect form on the carriers of goods belong ing to British merchants. 637. Mr. Thomson telegraphed to Colonel Ross that he had succeeded in To Colonel Ross, telegram No. 9, dated aist obtaining the despatch of telegraphic orders Apni 1884. t0 e ff ec t no g ate or 0 thcr dues beyond the legal 5 per cent, were to be levied from foreign merchants, and, in a To Colonel Ross, No. 15, dated a.si May ,884. des P at &lt;* of the same date, he forwarded a copy of the aforesaid telegraphic orders, and told Lieutenant-Colonel Ross that he was endeavouring to obtain orders for the repayment of the sums illegally levied on British merchants and for the acceptance in lieu of customs duty of the receipts they held, 638. In reply to a telegram from Mr. Thomson, stating that Persian Govern ment had promised discontinuance of boat and gate dues and would repay amount illegally levied, Lieutenant-Colonel Ross reported by telegraph that the amount of duty levied at the minor ports was about £ 120, besides a small sum levied for octroi at Bushire. Colonel Ross telegraphed that the Shah's promise had not been given effect to, and that a second payment of duty had been exacted on 75 bales of wool exported. 5^9. Mr. Thomson sent Colonel Ross copies of correspondence showing Mr Thomson's No. 20 (to Colonel Ross), dated that the Persian Government had promised 14th June 1884. to send stringent orders to the Bushire authorities to refrain from levying either directly or indirectly any duty upon British merchants beyond the regular 5 per cent. On the same day Colonel Ross was informed that the duty illegally levied as In No 21 from Colonel Ross, dated 14th aforesaid upon 75 bales of wool was to be June 1884. refunded. 640.

Notwithstanding the above-mentioned orders from Tehran, we find Eztern »i A., April 1887, Nos. 41-43. excess duties levied on exports from Ban- dar Mashur, Sultan, who had obtained control of the customs in of these duties as legal on the following grounds Rig and Dilam.

As regards the first and second propositions, Colonel Miles (Officiating Residrnt) could find nothing in the treaty respecting the restriction of trade to particular parts, or anything to sanction the additional duties demanded. As regards the third statement the remedy lay in the hands of the Persian author ities themselves, Bandars, Dilam and Rig were important channels for the export of grain from certain parts of Persia and British merchants could not be prevented from purchasing merchandise at those places if it suited them to do so (Colonel Miles to Mr, Nicolson, dated 27th August 1886). 647. In April 1887 Amin-es-Sultan informed Mr. Nicolson that ' bond has been piven that no customs duties on ex- Extemai a ., May 1887, Nos. 87 88. would be levied at those places, so he hopes former difficulties as to Jawazes will be avoided.' Arrangements for bring ing the customs to north of Bushire under Amin-es-Sultan had fallen through and the previous status was to continue. (xciii) Encroachments of the Governor of Bushire on British rights and privi leges; 1888. 648. In 1888 a new Governor by name Mahomed Hassan Khan was appointed for Bushire.

In August 1888 the customs master refused to recognize the usual passes granted by the Residency to clear goods at foreign rate customs in case of a consignment of the firm of Charles Sassoon of Manchester. In this action he was supported by the new Governor. 650. Further the Governor went so far as to announce to the Resident his Intention of opening at the custom-house all packages for Her Majesty's Legation and examine their contents, a proceeding heretofore unknown and which was contrary to the British Treaty rights as well as to diplomatic usages in Persia. 651. These extraordinary proceedings evoked a strong remonstrance from Sir Drummond Wolff to the Persian Government. The British Minister was of opinion that unless the Resident was strongly supported, our influence would wane in the Gulf; this was the object of Amin-es-Sultan who had farmed the whole customs duties. Lord Salisbury instructed Sir Drummond Wolff to state that Her Majesty's Government would hold Persian Government strictly res ponsible for any act of discourtesy to the British Consul-General or for damage to British subjects by arbitrary acts of Persian officials. 652. The result of the strong line of action taken by the British Minister was that orders were issued stopping the proceedings of the Governor of Bushire. The Amin-es-Sultan even offered to send telegrams instructing the Governor to apologize to the Resident for his conduct and dismissing the customs master. These orders it was considered unnecessary to insist on being issued as sub stantial justice had been done. t (xciv) Proposed Establishment of a bonded warehouse at Bushire^ 1882-1885. 653. The Government of India telegraphed on 22nd November 1882 to . oe ^ Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran that o itica iu . us 1 3, os. 33 35. they proposed to abolish transhipment duty on Persian opium and enquired whether this proposal might not be used as a lever to obtain concession regarding Karun or trade generally. The reply was that the Shah was still unyielding in his opposition to the Karun scheme, but that the Persian Government might possibly agree to establish bonded ware houses or allow drawback on re-exportation of goods from Persian ports in consideration of abolition of transhipment duty on opium (telegram, dated 25th November 1882).'73 654- In a despatch No. 5, dated 25th May 1883, to the Foreign Office, the A., General e ., April 1883, Nos. 4.7. at Tehran called attention to the A., General E., August 1883, Nos, ig-ai. advantage of establishing bonded ware- ^ 1 . . 1, , houses at Bushire. The Persian Govern, ment agreed to establish such a warehouse at that port for goods on payment re-exported ^ that ^ich^ere subs^ent?y ? £ other Persian ports or were sent into the interior from Bushire should then pay the balance of the import duty, namely, 4 per cent. The use of these warehouses was to be optional, as the Persian Government made it clear. Since the proposal was made, a treaty of commerce between the Netherlands A., Pol. E., February 1884, Nos. 402-^05. a Persia (Aitchison's Treaties Vol. X, i j i , f Appendix 44^ Persia) was signed, under which goods could be re-exported from Bushire upon payment of a duty of 1 per cent, m addition to some charge for storage. All other Powers enjoying^he iJst- favoured-nation treaty clause would of course be entitled to the same privilege. r r The C! ' eStl0n J 0f i the ex P edien cy of taking further steps to put this c :~ 0 praC ;V ce ' and t ^ us obtaining the establishment of bonded warehouses at Bushire was then brought under the consideration of the Government of India, and opinions of the Chambers of Commerce, Bombay and Karachi, were invited through the oombay Government on the proposed measure, 656. These Chamber^ of Commerce anticipated advantages from the establish- A., Pol. E., June 1SS4, Nos. 223.33. ment a bonde ^ warehouse at Bushire. . , j , » , ^ On the other hand, the opinion of the best mtormed merchants in the Gulf was not favourable to their institution. When the Gulr traffic was carried on by buggalows and other sailing ships, the need of an entrepot was much felt. At that time Lingah and Bandar Abbas formed entrepots for the adjacent Persian and Arab coasts, while Bushire transhipped to Koweit, Mohammerah, Shuster, Basrah, Bahrein, etc. But since the establish ment of steam communication in the Gulf, Bushire has lost its importance, has an entrepot and in 1884 there was scarcely any re-export trade at that port. ^57* The Government of India in submitting the correspondence to the Secretary of State observed in this despatch No. 72, dated 13th June 1884 : — Mf the assurances given by the Persian Government, that the use of the bonded warshouse will be optional and will not involve an additional charge of one per cent, duty, can be relied upon, we should be inclined to accept the arrangements advocated by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. But it seems improbable that they will be of much real benefit to trade in the Persian Gulf. ' 658. When the British Minister read this correspondence, he expressed his External A., March 1885, Nos. 40-43. surprise that the opinions of the Bushire authorities had undergone a change from what it was once before, when annoyance was felt at the want of drawback, and at the expense of re-shipping goods, etc. The existing indifference of the British merchants was in variance with the opinion of the French Government and indeed of all Foreign Governments concerned, who complained that by the non-ratification of the Perso-Dutch treaty foreign traders were deprived of the privilege of re-exporting their goods on payment of I per cent, instead of 5 per cent., and that they were all desirous of securing this concession (Mr. Ronald Thomson to the Government of India, dated 28th September 1884). 659- Colonel Ross, on being consulted, confined his observations to two points— (1) The system of bonded warehouses as applicable to Bushife only. (2) Its extension to other ports, such as Bandar Abbas and Lingah. In regard to (1), Colonel Ross drew attention to his previous reports, which showed how Bushire had ceased to be a port for re-export trade and that there was no likelihood of this trade reviving at Bushife. He thought that the provision of these warehouses was a step in the right di^ctiort and might be accepted by the British Government, although their establishment was not likely to affect British trade to any material extent, S640FD174 In respect to (2) he considered it inadvisable to introduce the system at these places. British merchants paid at the time 2| (3^?) per cent, on imports and nothing on re-exportation. On the establishment of ^ bonded ware houses, a re-exportation duty of 1 per cent, would be levied conditionally on their storage in the Persian warehouses and the probability was that the full 5 per cent, would be imposed on all other merchandise (No. 227, dated 1 ith December 1884). 660. Here the correspondence on the subject ceases. (xcv) Customs duty at Bandar Abbas, 1889-92. 661. It had been the practice previous to the year 1889 to charge 3^ per cent, ad •valorem on goods reaching External A., August 1889, os. 3 0 40. Bandar Abbas and to grant no pass for conveying them further. The absence of a pass subjected the consignee to further payments in the shape of road tolls, etc. At Bushire the practice was different, importers having to pay once for all 5 per cent, and receiving passes to cover the conveyance of their goods to destination free of further dues. 662. In 1889 a British Indian merchant of Meshed could not get his goods passed at Bandar Abbas on paying 5 per cent, duty and demanding a pass, which would exempt him from further exactions on the way. 663. Under our treaty rights British merchants were entitled to demand , . __ 00 .. the enforcement of the practice obtaining at External A., November 1889, Nos. 200-203. r, i • o i. ^.i- i. j • ^ i *11 Bushire. But there was nothing to be gained by insisting on the levy of 5 per cent, on all goods reaching Bandar Abbas, as it was an advantage in case of goods imported for local use at that port. At the same time it seemed desirable to endeavour to secure for traders a right to be supplied with an internal pass if they required one upon payment of the 5 per cent, duty (Foreign Department letter No. 2241 -E., dated 6th November 1889). 664. The difficulty was to induce the Persian Government to allow this External a ., November 1890, Nos. 136-41. diffeiential treatment. It was obvious that ,, December 1890, Nos. 94-96. there could not be two systems adopted, one August 1891, Nos. 193-200. j or j.j ie ] :)ene ^ t 0 { British merchants at Bandar Abbas, and the other for those in the interior. The correct system, therefore, thought Mr. R. T. Kennedy, His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, was the one which would provide for the levying of the 5 per cent, ad valorem duty at the port of entry, which the Persian Government was prepared to introduce (Mr. Kennedy to Major Talbot, dated 16th June 1891). The Government of India agreed in this view (No. 1691-E., dated 20th August 1891). it. 1 a p u, tQnn m 665. On 25th December 1802 the External A., February 1893, Nos. 269-71. . . j o u • t i i t-) • • i ht • Amin-es-Sultan informed the British Mms- ter that— 'British subjects will pay on the export of their goods from Bandar Abbas or Arze Akdas the full 5 per cent, duty to the customs officers, and shall receive a Government jowaz. On presenting this pass at the customs houses or toll stations on the road, no further duty shall be levied on the goods on any account.' (xcvi) Introduction by the Persian Government of new Jawazes or Internal Transit Passes, 1897. 666. On the 1st of Mohurrum 131 5 (1S97) the Karguzar of Bushire informed External a., November 1897, Nos. 119-24. the Resident that the Governor of the External b ., August 1898, No. 19. Persian Gulf ports had introduced a new form of jowaz or internal transit pass, embodying new clauses, namely :— (0 Each jowaz was to cover 50 packages or 25 loads. (») The number of the jowaz and a mark especially devised was to be put on the packages. (m) The foreign merchants should designate whether goods to be des patched were for disposal at Shiraz, Ispahan or Tehran.i7S (iv) A jowaz which was given for Shiraz would not be current at the custom-houses of Ispahan and Tehran. fv) A Jowaz would hold good only for six months. 667. The first and last clauses were especially objected to by the British merchants as innovations not warranted by the treaty. The Consul-General at Bushire represented their grievances to the British Legation, with what effect it is not traceable in the records. (xcvii) Transfer of Bushire Customs to the Imperial Bank of Persia, 1898. 668. In April 1898 orders issued by the Persian Government for the trans- Secret e ., September 1898, no?. i44'2ia. ^ Bushire customs to the Imperial Secret e., November 1858, Nos. 158.59.

This gave rise to much excitement amongst certain interested parties, as it was declared that an uniform rate of 5 P^r cent, would be levied in future and the Persian merchants feared that they would suffer by the increase of the duty at Bushire without at the same time exempting them from payment of the additional duties elsewhere, as were foreigners. It was also understood that food-stuffs would be taxed and strenuous efforts were made to oppose the bank, the mullahs being induced to declare that the arrangement was contrary to their religion. To prevent any outbreak at the custom-house, the Residency steam-launch with a crew of blue-jackets from H. M. S. Sphinx was anchored off the custom-house, in case it became necessary to protect the property of British firms collected there. The presence of this party probably prevented a serious riot from occur ring and the bank gradually took up the functions of managing the customs. The Persian Government withdrew its order insisting on the 5 per cent, duty being levied on goods of native merchants. This concession having been made the bank proceeded with the management of the customs. Their rule was popular and would have been more so as time went on. Unfortunately the loan had been given for a few months and when the period expired in August the money was forthcoming, having been supplied by Russia, who was not pleased to see a British institution, like the bank, obtaining the prestige, which the control of the customs gave.577 CHAPTER XI.

We have seen above how the customs management of Bushire was _ . £ . , . . , f . D . ( „ transferred to the Imperial Bank of Persia Gulf Administration Report for 1899-1900, page 3. • a m o o i • i i in April 1098 and withdrawn in August the same year. The customs were then farmed by the Darya Begi, who sublet the Hamal-Bashiship or control of lighters and porters to various individuals, whose sole object was to make as much as they could out of their concession. The result was that complaints of thefts and pilfering were incessant, but it was found impossible to obtain any satisfaction from the Governor, whose creatures the Hamal-Bashis were. 670. On the 21st March 1900 the control of the customs was taken under . „ . the direct mana^ament of the Persian Administration Report tor 1900 01. ^ iv /r o • • r i /-« Government. M. bimais, tormerly Commer cial Attache of the Belgian Legation at Tehran, arrived in Bushire and took up his appointment as ' Director-General of the Customs of Fars,' acting under the orders of M'. Naus, the Belgian Minister of Customs at Tehran. Other Belgian officials arrived, and the administration of the customs at Bushire, Lingah and Bandar Abbas was formally assumed. As was only to be expected, the new administration, which interfered with so many vested interests, experienced at the outset considerable opposition. At first it was intended to impose a uniform import duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem on all goods imported into Persia by the native merchants instead of the hitherto prevailing specific rates. This proposal, however, was stoutly opposed, and the native merchants of Bushire and Shiraz refused to clear their goods from the customs house. For a month or more business was entirely suspended, and goods imported remained uncleared. Both in Bushire and Shiraz the excitement was considerable, and it was feared that serious disturbances would occur. The Persian Government, therefore, decided to introduce a new tariff on a sliding scale, which would be more favourable to the native merchants than the proposed 5 per. cent. rate. This tariff was also opposed, but the Persian Government remained firm, and by the first week in August the new tariff came into force. Since then matters progressed smoothly, and*the customs administration succeeded in bringing into force the 5 per cent, rate for all native owned goods. Native merchants and foreigners were now, therefore, on the same footing as regards the payment of duty. 671. So far as the interests of European merchants were concerned, the establishment of the Belgian Customs Administration at the Gulf ports was entirely beneficial, and various improvements were effected. 672. From the point of view of the Persian Government, the new system of customs management resulted in a large increase of revenue. From a return, which the Director-General was good enough to give the Resident, his administration in the Gulf succeeded in bringing in an income of 3, 947,000 krans, a considerable increase over the sum of krans 2 ,400,000 for which the customs were formerly farmed. 673 In 1 go 1 the customs of Charbar and Gwettur, which had hitherto been l6 ' r. c farmed bv British Indian subjects, were Gulf Administration Report fori 901-02.

The Resident at Bushire reported to Sir A. Hardinge in June 1901 Secret E, October .cot, No. .66. tliat 'J 16 Customs authorities at that port were charging fees, which he estimated in one case at 2^ per cent, ad valorem on the transhipment of goods from one British vessel to another and contended that this was an infringement of the provision by which no import duty in excess of 5 per cent, ad valorem could be levied on our merchandise. He admitted, however, that in accordance with the practice prevailing in Indian ports a small fee might reasonably be charged for the time and labour of the customs officials in supervising the transhipment of cargo. 679. Sir A. Hardinge discussed the question with M. Naus, who at first strove to argue that as under the treaty of 1 urkomanchai there was no freedom of transit in Persia, the Persian authorities might, if they pleased, levy the full 5 per cent.^ on goods brought in transhipment or transit into any Persian port. Sir A. Hardinge pointed out that the usage of the past 60 years, not to speak of instruc tions to the contrary issued on several occasions by the Persian Government, was fatal to this contention, and M. Naus did not attempt seriously to defend. Sir A. Hardinge ultimately agreed as a provisional arrangement to a fee of 2| shahis (half the amount hitherto claimed) per package for the services of the customs officials on the understanding that it would be levied in the case of the vessels of all^ nations. M, Naus proposed eventually to introduce a regular scale based on weight (Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne, dated the 19th Julv 1901). 680. The Government of India, on being consulted by the Secretary of State, Secret e ., February 1902, Nos. 195.98. forwarded a statement ot transhipment . . fees levied in Indian ports,, and expressed the opinion that the rate provisionally agreed to was moderate though they considered that it might be of advantage to fix a maximum fee of the equivalent of 40 rupees, as in the Burma ports [Government of India (Revenue Department) to Lord G. Hamilton, dated 24th October 1901]. 681. The Board of Trade, in connection with certain suggestions made by Colonel Kemball, thought that, though they could not make it a condition that the proposed transhipment charges should be devoted to harbour inaprove- ments, it would be desirable that the question of harbour improvements should be borne in mind and urged on the Persian Government at the first favour-1 79 able opportunity, and that it should be clearly stipulated that the charges now imposed should not be increased without the consent of the British Government, and that within a. reasonable time they should be replaced by a new scale after consultation with the British Government. 682. Copies of the above correspondence were forwarded to Sir A. Hardin^e for iniormation and guidance on 2nd December 1901. But there is nothing to show in the records what further action was taken. ^ (c) Introduction of new Customs Tariff, 1903. 6S3. Ever since 1828 the trade relations of Persia with foreign countries except i urkey, had been practically governed by the treaty of Turkomanchai! which provided for a 5 per cent, ad valorem duty on Russian imports, and every Western country, including England, had been content from that time to stipu late for the insertion in its treaties with Persia of a most-favoured-nation clause, under which it could claim the same commercial treatment which had been granted to Russia. The hold over Persia, which the conditions of the loan of 1900 had conferred upon Russia, now gave the latter an opportunity for obtain ing an absolute contiol of the fiscal policy of Persia with regard to foreign trade, and when the recklessness of the i^hah compelled him in 1901 to seek further financial assistance from Kussia, he was only too willing to consent to a revision of the customs tariff, which, it was promised, would double his customs reve nue. Accordingly, a Mons. Goluboff, of the Russian Department of Finance r was sent to Tehran to arrange for the revision of article 3 of the Separate Compact referred to in the treaty of Turkomanchai, in accordance with an arrangement arrived at the previous summer with M. de Witte. The importance of not permitting the changes in the tariff to be arranged between Russia and Persia alone was recognised by Lord Curzon, who in his telegram of 1st October 1901 mcluded among the conditions on which India would advance a loan, one requiring the contemplated changes in the Persian tariff to be submitted for the assent of the Government of India, and this condition was substantially embo died in the offer made to Persia in November by His Majesty's Government. For other reasons, as already explained, the English loan was declined, but this condition alone would have been sufficient to prevent the negotiations taking form in that shape when the circumstance, not known till more than a year later, is stated that the new Commercial Convention was actually signed at Tehran by the Persian and Russian plenipotentiaries as early as November 9th, 1901, in spite of the fact that on numerous occasions since July 1900 His Majesty's Government had expressed through the British Minister their strong objections to the proposed increase of duty on tea, and had intimated to the Shah that they expected, in view of our great commercial interests in Persia, that the Russian Government would not finally decide on the new tariff without therrt. The secret was well kept, and the Persian Government allowed the British Minister to remain under the belief that the matter was still unconcluded. 684. The deception was also maintained after the Shah had left Tehran in April 1902 for a tour in Europe, which was to include a visit to England, and in* August of that year the Marquis of Lansdowne had a conversation with the Atabeg-i-Azam in London in which the latter went so far as to say that he would not definitely conclude the tariff without first enabling His Majesty's Govern ment to call attention to any provisions which might be calculated to inflict special injury upon British trade, and with this object would afford them unofficially the means of forming a judgment on the question, although in a written version of the conversation, he afterwards limited his promise to engaging to give us the means of forming a judgment about the equal incidence of the tariff upon all countries alike. Similarly, His Majesty the Shah (when stress was laid by Lord Lansdowne upon the importance of not coming to any settlement before the British Government had had an opportunity of stating their case) himself expressed the hope that Lord Lansdowne would explain to the Persian Government the objections which were entertained to the new scale of duties. • This account is taken from Mr. Persian Summary,i8o 685. While the Shah and his Minister were thus deluding the British Govern ment in London with promises which it was already out of their power to fulfil, M. Naus was engaged in getting removed the last obstacle to the introduction of the new Tariff, which remained in the shape of the Turko- Persian treaties of 1823 and 1848, the benefit of which other nations could claim under the most-favoured-nation clause, and during a visit to Constan tinople in August 1903 he persuaded the Porte to make an agreement in lieu of all former treaties, by which Turkey and Persia consented to grant each other the most-favoured-nation treatment in customs matters. 686. In the belief that the tariff was still open to modification, Lord Lans- downe proposed to the Persian Government to send an expert to lehran, but in December 1902 Sir A. Hardinge learnt that the Commercial Convention with Russia was already signed, and that the tariff was shortly to come into operation. As a matter of fact, the ratifications of the Russo-Persian Con vention of November 9th, 1901, were duly exchanged on December 27th, 1902, and a protocol was signed appointing February 14th, 1903, as the date at which the new tariffs were to come into force. 687. The danger of this tariff to Great Britain and to India lay not so much in the increase of duties, injurious to our SecretiE., March 1903, Kos. 261-328. interests, which it established, as in the possibility which it afforded for almost indefinite taxation of our products in the future by an impecunious Government living mainly on its revenue from customs, and looking to the increase of its customs revenues as the only security for the further borrowings from Russia, which, under the \&gt;xQstv\t regime, seem inevitable. Any fresh agreement with the Russian Government would, therefore, lead to the imposition of higher duties on goods in which Russian merchants are not interest ed, and place English and Indian trade at the mercy of a power whose avowed policy is to hamper it to the point of extinction. Recognising that the Persian Government was no longer a free agent and w r ould merely be able in future, as now, to plead vis major in answer to our objections, Sir A. Hardinge proposed, as the only method of protecting British commerce from still more injurious treatment hereafter, to recognise the Russo-Persian Convention as a fait accompli, and to induce Persia to conclude with us a special Convention exactly similar to that signed with Russia, which would at least protect our Persian trade against any further increase of duties without our consent. On this proposal the opinion of His Excellency the Viceroy was that if His Majesty's Government were prepared to hold the Persian Government to the spirit of the Grand Vizier's undertaking to Lord Lansdowne of 21st August 1902 that the new tariff would not be concluded without giving the British Government an opportunity of calling attention to any provisions calculated to inflict special injury upon British trade, and to demand reparation for violation of this undertaking, then it would be worth while to hold out for better terms from the Persians. But if His Majesty's Government were not prepared to fight the matter, then it was strongly recom mended that the Convention proposed by Sir A. Hardinge should be accepted. 688. M. Naus opposed the surrender by Persia of her present right to raise „ „ her duties on our imports with the permis- Secret E., August 1903, Nos. 280-312. . , ^ . 1 ,1 jxr- J sion 01 Russia, but the Grand Vizier, under promise of secrecy, adhered to the proposal, and a Convention was signed at Tehran on February 9th, 1903, four days before the Russo-Persian tariff came into effect. 688 A. Any detailed account of the new Tariff would be out of place here. It is sufficient to say that instead of the single duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem which was imposed upon imports and exports under article 3 of the Separate Compact relative to commerce, which was appended to the Treaty of Turkomanchai of 1828, the new Russo-Persian agreement substitutes a complicated system of specific duties, under which the chief imports and exports in which Russia is n ainly interested are treated with relative leniency, while those which chiefly affect Great Britain and India are severely penalised. Thus, to give a few examples affecting India; amongst imports, with regard to the Russian article petroleum, it has been estimated that the new rates effect a reduction of 3^ per cent, on the present tariff, while on tea, practically all of which comes from1 o 1 India, the tax is raised to 100 per cent. As to piece-goods, the change from an ad 'valorem to a weight tariff is greatly to the advantage of Russian goods, as cottons of Indian origin are comparatively much heavier than those coming from Russia, and will now lose the benefit derived from better methods of pro duction which they enjoyed so long as Russian goods, which are more expen sive, had to pay an ad 'valorem duty at the port of entry. As regards exports, the rates on grains of various descriptions which go to British possessions have been increased by percentages varying from 3^ to 20 per cent, while correspond ing articles of export to Russia on the Caucasian frontier, such as dried fruits, raisins, almonds, etc., are exempted altogether from duty. Cotton, which is only taken by Russia, is to be exported free, while opium, practically all of which is exported to British possessions, will have an increase of 8 per cent, on the present tariff. 689. The agreement finally stipulates that it shall never be modified without the consent of the Russian representative at Tehran, and that Russian subjects shall be privileged to pay the duties in Russian Bank-notes. 690. In accordance with article of the Anglo-Persian declaration of 9th Secret, February Igcs, Nos. 180232 (No. 225). February 1903, a draft Reglement Doua- Administration Report for 1904-05. n i er was prepared, and after considerable discussion and revision, it was signed by the Russian Minister, and afterwards by the British Minister, Sir A. Hardinge, on 29th August 1904. It came into force with effect from 1st September 1904. (ci) Proposed measures by the Persian Government to check contraband trade in the Persian Gulf, 1902. 691. In July 1901 the British Legation at Tehran informed Colonel Kemball that it was the intention of the Persian External A., January 1902, Nos. 19-22. ^ . 1 ^ Government, as soon as the new tantt then being negotiated with Russia came into operation, to publish a list of ports in the Persian Gulf at which goods might be imported and to prohibit their importation through all others, with a view to check contraband. And for the purpose of compliance with a request made by the Persian Government, the British Legation obtained from the Resident at Bushirea list of ports in which British trade is interested between Gwettar and the Shat-el-Arab, excluding the ports under the Sheikh of Mohammerah, as follows :— Gvvettar Charbar Jask. Minaub Kishm Bundar Abbas Kung Lingah Charak Bushire Dilam Island of Keis. Bundar Kelat. ,, Makam. ,, Shiru. „ Asalu. ,, Tallin. ,, Kangun. ,, Daiyer. „ Rohilla. » R'g Ganawa. Brace Piu-m Tank Gal lag or Rapch }-The Customs Administration had already establish ments at these places. Ports along the Mekran Coast, which are convenient ... ! at times for landing telegraph line material, ... I though British trade is not concerned in their .. J being kept open. S640FD182 692. Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball was of opinion that the closing of the smaller ports, which was apparently contemplated by the Persian Government, was likely to injure the coasting trade in the Gulf, and owing to the absence of internal communications, would probably react on foreign trade by impeding the collec tion of produce for export from the smaller ports as well as the distribution of imported supplies (Colonel Kemball to Sir A. Hardinge, dated 22nd September 1901). 693. The Government of India agreed in this view, but suggested that the difficulty might partly be met if the Persian Government were willing to adopt the principle of section 12 of the Indian Sea Customs Act (VIII of 1878) and to declare that certain of the smaller ports ' to be ports for the carrying on of coasting trade with customs ports or with any specified customs port and for no other purpose.' This step would, of course, require some form of customs control at these ports, but a preventive service would be needed even if all trade at these ports was prohibited (Foreign Department letter No. 2057 -E.A., dated 14th December 1901). (cii) Purchase of the Belgian Yacht Selika, re-named Mozafferi, for the use of the Customs Administration, 1903. 693. In January 1903 the Resident reported that the Belgian Yacht Selika, Secret E., May . 9 o 3 . Nos. 39-4.. ?; h , os . e move me n ts are noticed in the Precis on the International Rivalry and British Policy in the Persian (paragraphs 28 and 49), had been purchased by the Persian Government for the use of the customs administration and named Mozafferi. it was armed with two guns mounted on her bridge. She was manned with Belgian officers and Persian crew. She had not the status of a man-of-war. (ciii) Persian customs ports in Arabistan and the Persian Gulf, 1903-05. 694. The following are the places in the Persian Gulf and Arabistan, at Secret EFebruary .905, Nos. .80-332 (No. 2.9). f USt0mS T 18 ^ l ' een established. They are taken from the axtzchediio ihe Reglement Douajiier, which was forwarded by Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne with his despatch, dated 30th August 1904:— Arabistan. — ' Principaux,' ' Accessoires.' 1 Mohammerah 2 Ahwaz. 3 Dizful. 4 Shuster. 5 Busi. 6 Mashur. 7 Hindian, 8 Gadar-Baloutak,184 605. Since the above list was received customs ports have been established at the following places in the Persian Gulf:— )-In the Bundar Abbas Customs Circle. Secret E., February 1905. No?. IS46 I5SS' Secret E., June 190=, Ncs. 3-'8-33 0 - Secret E., September iqo5 i Nos. 54-67. Secret E . October 1905, Nos. 170-171. fcecret E., November 1905, Nos. 110-111. Ormuz Island Henjam Island Pulkhana Bostana Dishkoon, near Bassidore ... ... ... In the Lingah Customs Circle. Kharak Island ... ... ... ... In the Bushire Customs Circle. Laz ... ... ... ... In the Sheikh Shuaib Island. 696. In connection with the list of customs stations drawn up in pursuance ^ ^ of Article V of the Anglo-Persian Aeree- Secret E , September 1905, Nos. S4'67 (No. 56). . • . 11 1 ' j J t-u \ ment, it was pointedly laid down that no modification of that list would be made without the previous notification to the British Legation, but subsequent experience of the procedure of the Customs Administration has shown that in practice this provision has been ignored. Major Cox urged that it was of importance that we should insist on strict adher ence to the provision in question (Major Cox to Sir A. Hardinge, dated agth April 1905). 697. When the Customs Administration was reported to be contemplating a „ „ „. „ . customs port on Kharak Island, the Gov- ecret ., e ruary 1905, os. 154 i55S- ernment of India telegraphed to Mr. Grant Duff on 21st November 1904 :— ' We think establishment of customs port on Kharak likely to lead to harassment of Indian and Arab trade, and we trust you may be able to prevent it,' 698. The British Legation was not, however, able to prevent the measure ; a customs port was established on the Island in January 1905 in pursuance of an order of the Shah, dated 14th December 1504. (civ) Jolly boat incident off Lingah, 1904. 699. In June 1904, a jolly boat belonging to a subject of Debai landed some passengers with goods opposite Haji Abdul Rahman's house at Lingah. The nakhoda of the boat was thereupon arrested by the Customs Guards and after being detained for some days was released. The Director of Customs, however, detained the jolly boats pending payment of a fine of 1 .140 krans, being five times the duty leviable on goods landed presumably by the passengers. 700. From the correspondence between Captain Trevor and Mons, Waffa- laert, Director-General of the Customs of the South, it appears that the latter— (1) admitted Captain Trevor's right to interfere in cases of Arab sub jects of the Chief of Debai by asking him to recover the fine due from the nakhoda ; (2) in spite of this, did not admit that the nakhoda, an Arab subject, was entitled to proper enquiry by the Director and a representative of the British Government under article 15 of the additional obser vations to the Anglo-Persian Convention of 1903 or article 106 of new Reglement Legal (which had not come into force at the time) ; (3) contended that article 97 {b) of the Reglement was applicable to all , persons, Persian and Foreign alike; (4) declared that he had 'no knowledge whatever' of the Anglo- Persian Convention.&gt;85 Captain Trevor suggested to Her Majesty's Charge d'Affalres that Mons. Waffalaert's lamentable ignorance of conventions and regulations should be brought to the notice of Mons. Naus. 701. M. Waffalaert proceeded to Lingah and made some sort of enquiry, but refused to listen to the arguments of the Residency Agent and to alter his decision. The fine was ultimately paid by the nakhoda. (cv) Levy of customs on goods imported into Bushire on Government service or for the Resident's personal use, 1903. '702. In 1902 Colonel Kemball raised the question, which he expected would probably arise at an early date, as to secret E., June 1903, Nos. 223-225. whether the Persian Government would be entitled to impose duties on goods imported into Persia for the use of his estab lishment and of Government, apart from his personal use. A similar question had come up before the Government of India in May 1902 in connection with Toshakhana pre- Frontier A., November 1902, Nos. .-2. received at the Consulate-General at Meshed. The British Minister instructed the Consul-General that they were for his personal use, as otherwise the Persian Government were likely to demur to granting exemption of duty. The Government of India, however, informed the Consul-General that a general exemption from Customs duties had long been enjoyed by the Persian Consul-General at Bombay, and that the Tehran Legation might be asked to claim for the Resident a similar privilege which would cover Toshakhana articles. The Government of India did not approve of the sugges tion to describe these articles as for the Consul-General s personal use (telegram dated 2nd June 1902). 703. In the case of Bushire, the Government of India likewise informed th6 Resident that the Persian Consul-General Secret e., June ^os, &gt; os. 223-225. ^ i ori g enjoyed a general exemption from Customs duties on articles imported whether officially or for his personal use. Accordingly, in the event of the Persian authorities pressing the claim referred to, he was told to ask the British Minister to claim for him a similar exemption (No. 569-E., dated 23rd March 1903). (cvi) Levy of customs duties on provisions of His Majesty's ships at Bushire, 1501-05. 704. In December 1901 the Customs authorities at Bushire began to levy export duty at the rate of 5 P® 1 ' cent, on all goods despatched from the shore to British men-of-war in harbour. This had never been the practice before. Most of these goods had already been subjected to an import duty of 5 per cent, on entry into Persia. After vainly endeavouring to settle the matter with the local Director of Customs, Colonel Kemball, in his letter No. i75&gt; dated the 27th December 1901, made a reference to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. 705. In reply Mr. Alban Young, on the 8th February 1902, forwarded a copy of a despatch on the subject addressed by Sir Arthur Hardinge to His Majesty's Secretary of State. 706. In his No. 50, dated 21st March 1902, Colonel Kemball reported to His Majesty 's Minister that having received a complaint from our Naval Con tractor, Mr, Goolzad, to the effect that he had been made to pay export duty at 10 per cent, on certain provisions sent by him to the Lawrence on which he had already paid 5 per cent, import duty, thus making a total of 15 per cent, ad he had made enquiries from the Director-General of Customs, who in confirming the charge, said that he had made a certain arrangement with the Naval Contractor. This arrangement, said Colonel Kemball, must prove extremely inconvenient and is moreover unnecessarily exacting. S &amp;40FDi86 707. Writing on the 7th November 1902, to His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, Colonel Kemball referred to Foreign Office despatch No. 65, dated 5th July 1902, and pointed out that the Customs authorities continued to charge an export duty of to per cent, ad valorem, not only upon livestock and cereals, the export of which had been prohibited, but also upon rice, ghee and potatoes, even though these articles may have already paid an import duty of 5 per cent, and one of 20 per cent, ad valorem upon livestock sent on board Bri tish ships. 708 In reply His Majesty's Minister in his No. 6, dated the 20th March 1903, forwarded a copy of a despatch which he had addressed to the Foreign Office on the question, in which it was mentioned that Monsieur Naus now stated that the levy was not export duty but ' payment for exemption.' His Excellency finally directed that in accordance with M. Naus' wishes a formal re presentation should be made to the Chief of Customs, Bushire. A reference was forthwith made to the local Customs and they were asked to refund the duty hitherto*paid in excess of 5 per cent., but in spite of the fact that the suggestion to address the local Customs emanated from M. Naus, the Director-General referred the Residency back to his Chief and said he could do nothing without his instructions. 709. From April 1903 onwards further fruitless correspondence ensued and the local Customs would give no other answer than that they had referred the matter to M. Naus, and in spite of repeated reminders, they merely intimated that M. Naus had not yet issued orders. 710. This unsatisfactory state of affairs continued until the 30th June 1904 when His Majesty's Minister was again addressed in this office No. 90, and asked to press the Central Customs authorities for a definite settlement. A further reminder was sent on the 28th February 1905. 711. On the 19th April the Director-General communicated the decision of the Central Administration, Tehran, which states that the ' taxe de dispense ' on the exportation of cattle and cereals was fixed at a uniform rate of 10 per cent., and that the Bushire Customs were therefore right in demanding this rate of duty.. No mention whatever was made regarding the refund of duty levied in excess of 5 per cent, upon other article than livestock and cereals for which we have continually pressed. This last communication is dated Tehran, 28th March 1905, and is not signed by Monsieur Naus but by Monsieur Lavers. 712-13. Major Cox again asked the British Minister on 8th July 1905 to secret E., October 1905, No. 168. press for the refund of the excess duty paid. (evil) Purchase by the Persian Government of five steam launches Lr Customs Service in the Persian Gulf, 1903-05. 714. The Persian Government in September 1903 expressed a desire to have Secret E., A„go S t .904, Nos. 94-0.. three small steam cutters at about .£3,000 each tor Customs Service in the Persian Gulf. They had offers from Europe, bu^ preferred to purchase them in Bombay. In November 1903, the Persian Minister of Customs informed Mr. Grant Duff that a grant had been sanctioned to provide five steamers in successive delivery. 715. The Government of India ascertained from the Director of the Royal Indian Marine that the steam launches required could be constructed in the Bombay Dockyard at an estimated cost of a little in excess of ^3,000 (Foreign Department letter to Sir A. Hardinge, dated 20th January 1904). 716. The Persian Government accepted the tender of the Royal Indian Secret e.. February 1905, Nos, 1539-1549. Marine for the construction of the steam launches for about £^000 each. They were willing to pay the price mentioned by the Government of India, but M. Naus requested that, if possible, the extra 25 per cent, charged by the Royal Indian Marine on orders executed for Foreign Government should in this caseiSy be reduced. Sir A. Hardinge recommended that should the Government of India be able to give some elasticity to this Regulation, they should grant a relaxation of it in this case to the Persian Government, as to a neighbouring state, who might by some such means be encouraged to place in the same quarter any further orders that she might have in the future and thus to look to us primarily for assistance in connection with the development of its resources in the Persian Gulf (Sir A. Hardinge to the Government of India, dated 3rd September 1904). 717. The Government of India informed Sir A. Hardinge on 25th December 1904 that it was hoped that the five launches would be ready about October and December 1905, and January, March and April 1906, respectively. 718. The question about the proposed remission of 25 per cent, was left unanswered (see notes in Secret E., February 1905, Nos. 1539-1545). (cviii) Discontinuance of the Rahdari and other illegal taxes, 1905. 719. Various petty taxes used to be levied under various names— Rahdari, Secret e ., June .905, Nos. 4-14. Ddlali (brokerage), Kapandari (weighing secret e , October 1905, Nos. 506-507. fees), etc., on foreign caravan goods at Secret E.. December .905, Nos. 42-43. Daliki on the Bushire-ShiraZ road, at Godar Balutak on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road, and elsewhere, which were in violation of the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1903 and the Reglement Douanier. His Highness Prince Shoa-es-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Fars, was mainly instru mental in maintaining these taxes. 720. Representations were made at Tehran by the British and Russian Ministers, and ultimately, it was reported, the Rahdari tax was discontinued with effect from the afternoon of the Sth October 1905. • (cix) Belgian Customs officials in the Persian Gulf. 721. The following Belgian gentlemen have held the post of Director- Generals of Southern Customs :— Mons. Simais. Mons. Dambrain—proceeded on furlough in May 1904. Mons. E. Waffalaert—transferred from Mohammerahin May 1904. He was transferred to Kermanshah in February 1905. Mons. Heynssens, February 1905—transferred from the Caspian Division. 722. The Belgian Directors wield immense power in the Persian Gulf and „ VT are treated with great respect by the Secret E., September 1904, No. 55. -n • v t? • i i Persian authorities. Tor instance, when Mons. Dambrain arrived at Lingah in April 1904, a salute of seven guns was fired from the Government House, and he was accorded other honors due to a Persian Governor. 723. Even a good Governor like the Darya Begi appears to be completely _ _ , VT under the control of the Belgian Director ecret ., ju y 1905,. os. 392 393- o £ Customs, who under recent orders disburses his pay. 724. Mons. Waffalaert, an aggressive enthusiast, was reported in November _ _ _ . xt o 1 9 0 5i t 0 have received a Russian decora- Secret E., December 1905, No. 458. j j. r j r xs i 1 tion, and transferred from Kermanshah to Mohammerah as Director of Customs for Arabistan in place of Mons. Dambrain, who was a friendly and easy going official, and worried into retirement. ..... „ 725. It appears that M. Heynssens is ecret pn 1905, o. 124. believed to be a troublesome official. 726. It may be mentioned that Mons. Lavers, Secretary General of the Ibid Customs Department, who acted during Mons. Nans' absence, was reportied in February 1904 to have received the Russian decoration of St. Stanislaus.189 CHAPTER XU. Persian Customs interference with the British Postal arrange- ments. (cx) Interference with the parcel system. 727. British post offices were opened in the following ports of Persia, the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman in the years mentioned against each :— Bushire ... ... ... ... 1864. Lingah ... ... ... ... 1867. Bundar Abbas... ... ... ,,, 1867. J ask ... ... ... «.. ... 1880. Mohammerah... ... ... ... 1892. 728. For a detailed history of these post offices we must refer to the Memo randum en the British Indian Post Offices in the Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia, compiled in the Post Master General's Office. Here we shall relate recent facts connected with the Persian Customs interference with certain old postal rights and privileges. 729. These British post offices on the Persian coast were established and c &lt;■ 1? t? u „ „ „ have existed with the tacit approval of the Secret E., February 1905, Nos. 477-502. ^ . , , 1 r 1 Persian Government, though no formal agreement appears to have ever been made for their creation or maintenance. For more than forty years letter and parcels have been carried for British and Persian subjects to the benefit of the latter when no Persian post office was maintained. No portion of the subsidy paid for the mail steamer has ever been paid by the Persian Government. 730. When the Belgian Customs Administration was first started, the Sect E., February .903, Nos. 477-30=. (No. q ues t io n 0 f P^cels was raised and in June 479, enclosures). igoo an agreement was arrived at between the Resident and Director-General of Cus toms, which is quoted on pages 31 and 32 of the Post Office Memorandum above referred to, and in the Proceedings noted in the margin. Article 8 of the Agreement provides that parcels for the Resident, his See Captain Toot's telegram, dated joth Oeto- assistants, the Residency Surgeon and the ber 1904. Residency establishment (omcers of the ^Secret e., February 1905, Nos. 477-502 (No. Superior Service), also that belonging to Her Majesty's and Royal Indian Marine Ships, should be omitted from the list and delivered direct to the addressees. This article had been questioned several times by the Customs officials. Mons. Waffalaert wanted to stop the privilege. But Major Cox pointed out that the concession was much prized, as it obviated unnecessary delays and formalities in the Custom House, and that the return forwarded by the post office was an efficient check, and that if Foreign Consulates objected, as was alleged, our occupation in the Gulf for the last 150 years should entitle us to enjoy small concession of this sort. M. Waffalaert expressed himself entirely satisfied. 731. In October 1904, the Ministry of Customs made a formal complaint .... N to the British Legation against the British Post Office at Bushire, stating as their grievance that it refused to submit to examination by Customs authorities parcels addressed to the Residency and British Post Office officials. The action of the British Post Office was contended to be illegal under Articles 27 and 51 of the R^glement Douanier. The Secretary General wished that in future post bags that were addressed to British officers at the southern ports must be taken direct to the Customs House and there opened by British Post Office officials in the pre sence of Customs officers, who would retain parcels or letters liable to duty and give receipt for the same; addressees would then be asked to come and claim S640FDigo them. The same facilities would be observed in the case of the outgoing mail bags. Diplomatic and Consular immunities would be respected, but the British Post Office officials and quarantine doctors had, it was contended, no right to exemption from payment of duties. There were further complaints that merchants took parcels direct from the British Post Office. 732. Mr. Grant Duff referred the matter for the opinions of the Resident and the Government of India, and asked the Customs authorities that the exist ing system should be allowed to stand pending instructions. 733. In telegraphing the above facts to the Government of India, Mr. Grant Jbid No 477. observe d (telegram dated 21st Octo- ber 1904):— ' An attempt to interfere with our post offices will probably be followed on Monsieur Naus' return by an attack on our quarantine. The policy of the ptesent Grand Vazier is to suppress all Foreign influence in Persia, and he daily becomes more obstructive^ I think the Persian Government is afraid. We intend to bully them now that we see Rus sia is engaged in the Far East with Japan.' 734. Captain Trevor telegraphed to Mr. Grant Duff on 30th October 1904, /hid No. 478. g ivTin £ a brief history of the parcel system in force in the Bashire British Post Office. As regards the allegation about merchants receiving parcels from the Post Office, he stated that there was no evidence whatever to prove it. Post Office officials are regarded as Residency officials, because the Post Office was managed by Residency clerks for years, until the work increased, and it became necessary for departmental details to be dealt with by the officials of the Postal Depart ment. Even now the Post Master is under the Resident and cannot communi cate with local officials, and questions of pay, local allowances, etc., are dealt with by the Postal Department through the Residency. The Quarantine Doctor is an Assistant to the Residency Surgeon and does quarantine work in addition to his ordinary duties. Captain Trevor added— ' The amount of revenue involved is insignificant. I deprecate any alteration in exist ing practices, or any reduction of the small privileges now enjoyed by us as a result of our long^ and useful work in the Gulf. The Resident has placed on record that he is of the same opinion '. 735. On the 24th November Mr. Grant Duff telegraphed to the Government ibid, No. 481. that the Customs Department had again complained that parcels for Consular officers which arrived by the British Post Office were not declared and had furnished him with a list of the persons who received such parcels during the month of October. Many persons shown on the list appeared to Mr. Grant Duff to have had no right to exemption., and he wished to know how we could defend such action as we had accepted the Reglement. He had been informed privately that at the meeting of the proposed forthcoming International Postal Conference at Rome, the question of British Post Offices would be raised. 736. On the 23rd November 1904 Captain Trevor telegraphed to the Gov- ihid, N01.482.483. ernment of India that he had been request ed to inaugurate a new arrangement for parcel post beginning with the mails arriving on the 24th November. On the 26th he telegraphed to say that the old arrangement would continue for the week running. On the 1st of December in compliance with orders received from Mr. Lavers acting for M. Naus, M. Waffalaert took possession of the pgstal bags received that day by force (Captain Trevor's telegram dated 2nd December 1^04). 737* ^ r * Grant Duff on learning by telegram of the unwarranted conduct ihid, No. 484. the Customs authorities at Bushire strongly protested against the proceedings and was assured by the Grand Vazier that the post would be returned at once to the Residency, He also informed the Mushir-ed-Dowleh that he had instructed the Residency to resist by force any further tampering with the British mails until the question vas properly settled between the Persian Government and the British Legation,191 .u l 3S ' i 0i ^ 5th Dumber 1904 Mr. Grant Duff was present at a meeting of the Grand Vazier, Mushir-ed-Dowleh, and the Director of Customs. The com plaint ot the Persian Government was that parcels arriving by post at Bushire were not declared at the Custom House, which was contrary to the Re^lement Douamer and consequently paid no duty. As we had agreed to the RMement, Mr Grant Duff thought that it was difficult to defend the above practice and pending rewpi of instructions he arranged that parcels received at the British fost Office should he opened in the presence of a Customs Officer who was to take a list of addresses and levy duty on goods of persons not exempted by the Re j lenient (telegram dated 5th December igo4). 739. The Government of India in their telegram to Mr. Grant Duff dated ibid, No. 490. 1 4 th December 1904— (a) proposed that the arrangement agreed to in 1900 should be adhered to, supplemented by a provision that all parcels be accompanied by cusl O itis declarations, which with invoice of parcels prepared by the Indian Office of Exchange should be enclosed in a separate envelope addressed to the Persian Customs House, and imme diately on landing of the parcel bags delivered to the Customs House, a similar arrangement has been long in force in Constanti nople and was in 1891 adopted at Baghdad and Basrah ; {b) strongly objected to examination by the Customs House in the case of the letter mail. No such examination occurs at Baghdad or Basrah, and there seemed no reason to suspect evasion of customs dues by means of the letter post; (&lt;?) stated with reference to Mr. Grant Duff's telegram of 24th November they were prepared to repress rigorously unauthorized immunity from customs dues. The Government of India telegraphed to Captain Trevor to report on this point ; {d) stated as their opinion that the high-handed action reported in Captain Trevor's telegram dated 2nd December furnished ground for demand for prompt recognition of our special position in postal matters, if under articles 27 and 51 of the R5glement further attempt was likely to be made to undermine it. 740. In compliance with a request made by the Government of India, ibid, No. 498. Major Cox submitted with his letter No„ 428, dated 24th December 1904, three Statements :— Statement A—List of officers on the Residency establishment who had hitherto been exempted from payment of duty on postal parcels, which includes in fact all members of the Residency establishment and the post office, except the menials. Statement B, —List of officers exempted by the R^glement Douanier, Article 27 (3) as enjoying Diplomatic and Consular privileges, that is. Resident, Residency Surgeon, the First Assistant Resident and the Extra Assistant Resident, Consuls and Vice-Consuls at Bushire, Bandar Abbas, Mohammerah and Ahwaz, and the Residency Agent at Lingah. Statement C. —List of officers proposed to be exempted as Dragomans to Consulates under Article 27 (3) of the Reglement, namely, one Consular clerk each at Mohammerah, Ahwaz, Bandar Abbas, Kerman, Shiraz, and Ispahan, and the Superintendent and Head Clerk in the Residency Office, and the Consular Clerk of the Vice- Consul at Bushire. Secret E., November .905, Nos. .3-38 (No. 14). 74'• Oil l6th February 1905, Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed to the Government of India :— ' It has already lien claimed in an official note addressed to the Minister of Customs by me that the Rtglement Legal has nothing to do with the British Post Offices in the192 Persian Gulf, and as their establishment and funds are independent of any commercial convention between Persia and ourselves, they are altogether outside the scope of its jurisdiction. We are in a position to maintain this view if we please by forcible meanSy hut I have added that I should be quite willing to discuss and submit to Government of India any special arrangements relating to the payment of duty on parcels which Persian Government may wish to embody in a new agreement ad hoc. 742. On the 24th February 1905 Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed to say that the Persian Government put forward the ibid, No. 16. following proposals—(1) to separate letter bags from parcel bags, the latter being liable to be examined by the Customs authorities in accordance with Article 27 of the Reglement; (2) to conclude with them a special agreement regulating the exchange of postal correspondence between India and Persia. They pointed out that Persia had now a parcel postal service of her own, and that it could never have been intend ed that parcels containing dutiable articles should, without payment of duty, enter the country through our post offices. 74 / ?. The Government of India teleeraph- /M, No, 17, j • 1 &lt;r-u a/t u - ed in reply on 16th March 1905— 'The Persian Government claim apparently that parcels should be separately bagged in order that they may be delivered direct at Customs Houses at Persian Gulf ports and are not prepared to accept the arrangement outlined in my telegram dated 14th December 1904. Further information is desirable as to the full meaning of the Persian Government before an opinion can be offered on proposed agreement. Secondly, we would ask for a clearer indication as to what the basis will be before accepting the principle of a formal agreement.' 744. On 8th June 1905, the Secretary of State telegraphed that Sir A. Har- Ibid No i dinge was being authorized to conclude, in consultation with the Government of India, an arrangement with the Persian Government on the lines of the procedure which is observed at Constantinople in regard to parcel mails from the United Kingdom. No . 34 . But in his despatch of 19th May 1905 Sir A. Hardinge stated that Mons. Naus desired to conclude a Postal Convention with the Government of India and would like a representative of the Indian Post Office to be sent to negotiate or assist in the negotiation of it. 745. The Government of India in their letterto Sir A. Hardinge, No. 29561- E.A., dated 19th September 1905, laid ihid. No.38. stress upon the privileged position which the British Post Offices in the Persian Gulf occupy and the desirability of not abandoning it by recourse to a Postal Convention. It would, in the circumstances, be more consistent with Indian interests to limit the negotiation to the conclusion of an agreement with the Persian Government in regard to parcel mails only. This might be done without the assistance of an Indian official deputed to Tehran. If, however, Sir A. Hardinge thought it necessary to conclude a general postal arrangement, there would be some difficulty of sparing an Indian Postal Officer with the required qualifications. His views were therefore asked on the following alternative proposals :— {a) Matters might stand over until after the International Postal Congress, at which an informal discussion might be started and the views of M. Naus ascertained, so as to enable the British Government to find a basis for negotiation. (£) If, however, it was necessary to enter into negotiations at once, would it not suffice if an Indian Political Officer were deputed to Tehran, after mastering postal details ? Considering the political interests involved, a Political Officer would be preferable to a purely Postal Officer. 746. On the 9th April 1905, Mons. Heynssens, the new Director-General Secret e., September 1905, Nos. 218-221. of Customs, informed Major Cox that he had been instructed to levy customs duty from the Residency Surgeon and the Extra Assistant Resident, and from August194 stepping stone to a further demand that the letter mail should also be examined by the Customs authorities on the plea that some letters might contain articles which are liable to duty and considered that there were reasons for resisting the proposal (Foreign Department letter No. ii 82- E,A ., dated the 20th March •90S)- (cxii) Use of Indian stamps for local letters for foreign countries at ports in Persia where there are Indian Post Offices. 751. The Indian Post Offices in Persian ports accept no local letters for other Secret E., November 1905, Nos .3-38 (No. 23). f Per ? ian . P 0rtS and . rec ? ive Up -COuntry mails tor toreign countries in sealed bags from the Persian Post Office, and /oca/ letters for foreign countries franked with Indian stamp. There appears to have been a tacit understanding that the Persian Post Offices at Gulf ports should not accept local letters for foreign countries. This appears to be only fair, as the letters are carried entirely at the cost of the Indian Post Office. 752. The Director-General of Posts of Arabistan, however, informed the British Consul at Mohammerah in March 1905 that according to instructions received from the Ministry of Customs and Posts, he could no longer permit letters from the inhabitants of Mohammerah for foreign countries be franked by Indian stamps. He desired that such letters should be franked by Persian stamps and be sent by the Persian Post Office in a closed bag to the Anglo- Indian Post Office. 753* The British Consul refused to comply with the request pending instruc tions from the authorities in India (Mr. McDouall to Sir A. Hardinge, No. 10, dated the 18th March 1905). G.G. Press, Simla,—No. S640 P.
