Elliot, No. 34 ; June 11, 1874, THERE is no clause in any of our Treaties with Turkey either permitting or prohibiting the passage of British ships of war up the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, but, although the right of navigating the rivers and canals of the Ottoman Empire under the British flag is not secured to British subjects by Treaty, the Porte would not appear to have ever officially announced that British ships of war were prohibited from visiting the internal waters of the Empire. The following is a short account of what has passed upon this subject:— In 1834 the Porte sanctioned, by a Firman, the employment by the British Government of two vessels in the River Euphrates for commercial pur poses, and, as the water in the river was too shallow to admit of vessels being sent up the river from the sea, the vessels intended for this service were conveyed by Colonel Chesney in pieces to Scanderoon, via Aleppo, to Bir, on the Euphrates, where they were put together. In 1840 other vessels were sent out, which were also shipped in pieces, and put together at Bus- SOFclh ^ In 1874 Her Majesty's ship 'Philomel' paid a visit to Koorna, which is situated upon a part of the River Tigris close to the point where the Tigris and Euphrates join, and form the Shatt-el-Arah, • On the 13th September, 184'2, 2nd April, 1846, and l^th January, 1861, Vizirial Letters were issued by the Torte 'ative to the navigation of the Tigris and Enphrates b, Brittsh vessels (copies of which are annexed). [721]whereupon the Governor of Bagdad protested against the act in a letter to the British Consu - General at Bagdad, in which he said 'The marine authorities write that the Bntis corvette Philomel,' which had arrived at Bussorah, has this day, at 1 o'clock early morning, proceeded up to Koorna. Owing to the improper conduct on the part of the French corvette in proceeding to the same place some time ago, the French Embassy at Constantinople as well as the Foreign Office of that Government being in communication with, and there being no permission for war vessels to pro ceed thither, I have herewith the honour to protest against the impropriety of the advance in that manner of the said corvette 4 Philomel' without giving notice to Government, and to state that telegraphic orders may immediately be dispatched with a view to return back, and I may be soon informed with the aflair. To which the Consul-General leplied :— 'Tt has always been supposed that the Shatt- el-A ib is a free river, and practically it certainly is so, and can scarcely be otherwise, Koorna being a chief dep6t for the exportation of dates; sea going craft under foreign flags are in the habit ot there taking in their cargoes; a French corvette visited that place in 1864, and last year Her Britannic Majesty's ship 'Vulture' did the same, no objection having been raised in either case so far as I know. I request your Excellency will be so good as to inform me under what Begulation this new objection is raised, and what evil consequences are apprehended from vessels proceeding thither. 'When fully informed of the ground of your Excellency's action I shall be happy to refer the question, on which I refrain from offering any decided opinion, to superior authority.' To this the Governor of Bagdad replied:— ' It needs no comment that the part from Bus sorah to Koorna is not a free river, but the Turkish side with its dependencies, to the point below Bussorah on the Shatt-el-Arab, and specially both banks above Bussorah, being the real possession of the Ottoman Government, the entry of foreign merchant-vessels, and specially vessels of war, into rivers such as this, of which the fountain-head and outlet are situated within the dominion of theI Ottoman Government, unless it be with the consent and acquiescence of the Government, is according to rules inadmissible. f 1 he official telegraphic communication lately held, with respect to the visit to Koorna, the other day, of the French corvette being publicly known, and the advance of the said corvette 4 Philomel' further up than Bussorah to Koorna, amounting to an act of aggression, bearing similarity to an act of military invasion of boundary, it is this act of passing beyond rights and privileges upon which the protest and objection is based. 'Touching the statement as regards the visit last year or still before of certain corvettes, there is no record or information forthcoming with Government. ' If such occurrence has taken place, it must also be termed to have been an act beyond rights, through neglect of the rights of the Ottoman Government, as in the present instance, it is evident that there is no necessity that an irregular and unrulj act should have a duration, or be taken as a precedent, and a pause being offered to expression on the question made with respect to the evil consequences thereof, I state that in consideration of the friend ship and amity existing between the two Govern ments the advance of the said corvette, at her own wish, in the manner stated, to a point which is not open to vessels of war, being tending to bring about derangements of the rights of the Government, I accordingly herewith repeat the sense of my former communication.' Upon this the Consul-General stated that he had 'directed Her Majestys Vice-Consul at ^Bussoiah to take measures to prevent any armed British vessel from again visiting Koorna, pending a final reply to the reference of the question to Constan tinople;' and in his despatch to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople the Consul-General said:— ' As pointed out in my first letter to the Goveinoi- General, it has always been supposed that the Shatt- el-Arab is a free river. Foreign vessels of war have on former occasions visited Koorna without any objection being raised. ' Sea-going craft under foreign flags are in the habit of there taking in their cargoes of dates, andmm 7 it would be an inconvenience to trade to interfere with them in so doing.' On receipt of this correspondence, Sir H. Elliot addressed an official despatch to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which he said :— ' As hitherto, and even so recently as last year, Her Majesty's ships of war have been in the habit of visiting Koorna, and as no notification has ever been made by the Sublime Porte 'ot a dcsite that the practice might be discontinued, it is not with out surprise that I have seen the Governoi-General of Bagdad take upon himself to designate as im proper the prcceedings of the Commander of the 'Philomel' for doing what had been dons before without protest or objection on the part of either the Sublime Porte or local authorities, with whom, till the administration of the important Province of Bagdad was directed by his Excellency Redif Pasha, the Consular and other officers of Her Majest&gt; Government have always maintained the ' cofuitH 1 fi ondly relations which it is the wish of Her Majesty's Government to see cultivated. ' Judging from his Excellency's correspondence, it would ippear as though he regarded the appear ance of the 4 Philomel' in that part of the river as implyin a doubt of the sovereignty of the Sultan ever it, aild a more uncalled-for interpretation of such a simple act could not well be conceived. ' j have the Uoaour, therefore, to request that, if at any time the Sublime Porte should wish to propose new Regulations, or to alter a practice that has prevailed in reference to the presence of ships of w T ar in any part of the Sultan's dominions, due notice of it may be given to Her Majesty's Government, who will not fail to give such in structions as will insure from the Commanders of British ships of war every respect for the rights of the Sublime Porte. ' In the meantime, however, I would beg that orders may be sent to the Governor-General of Bagdad not to interfere with the existing Regula tions or practice without the previous sanction of the Porte, and to maintain, in his communication with Her Majesty's Cousul-General, that courtesy which we are entitled to expect.' In forwarding home the correspondence, Sir H. Elliot observed:— *•••&lt;•• .-rv-..-, . ■ .UT 1 Wm- iw ; '-w si -4. -Admiralty; August 4, 1874. The tone adopted by the Governor-General, in protesting for the first time against a proceeding never before objected to, appears altogether un warranted, and I have consequently brought the case before the Porte by the note herewith inclosed in Copy. ' Of the right of the Porte to exclude ships of war from the waters of these rivers, there cannot, 1 imagine, be a doubt; and I have not supported the view taken by Colonel Herbert, who alludes to the fact of sea-going merchant-vessels taking in their cargoes at Koorna ; but I have insisted that if changes are to be made in the regulations or prac tice with regard to ships of war in Turkish waters they ought to be made known to Her Majesty's Government, who would give the necessary in structions to the Commanders. ' Colonel Herbert appears to have done all that could be required, by assuring the Governor that no ship of war should ascend the river till the question was decided at Constantinople. ' The Commander of the French corvette alluded to in this correspondence does not seem to have shown an equal amount of discretion, for, as 1 learn from Count de Vogiie, he had already received the intimation of the Governor, that he objected to her going up the river before the ship left Bussorah, and he went in defiance of it.' The Commander of Her Majesty's ship 'Phi- lomel ' informed the Admiralty that no remon strance was made by the Turkish authorities to his going to Koorna, but, on the contiary, that when he arrived at Bussorah (in the Shatt-el-Arab) he saluted the Turkish flag, which was returned by a Turkish corvette, and that shortly after anchoring he received a visit from the Turkish captain, who informed him that he had been sent by the Admiralty to thank him tor the salute, and to express his pleasure at seeing an English man -of-war at Bussorab. The Commander added that the English Vice-Admiral had informed him that by Treaty the river was free for all nations up to Koorna, and that Her Majesty's ship 'Vulture' had the year previously visited that Sir H .Elliot; September 5, lo/*. 1 But on the 5th September following Sir H. Elliot [721] CG was informed that Great Britain had no Treaty stipulations with Turkey giving right of navigating the internal waters of Mesopotamia. In February 1875, the Porte threatened to with draw the privilege which had been granted to the 'Comet' to navigate the Tigris, on the ground that she was in excess of the number authonzed, and that she had been so metamorphosed as to have the appearance of a man-of-war; and Sii H. Elliot remarked, in his despatch reporting the fact, that during the whole of the conversation which he had had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, lie 'was careful not to claim for Her Majesty's Government a right to station a man-of-war in in land waters, but at the same time to let it be understood that a privilege which had been freely aranled for so many years co^Ui not be suddenly withdrawn v.'ithout giving cause to Her Majesty's I Government to inquire whether the Porte was animated by the same friendly feelings as formerly iu -vaid- Great Britain.' After this the objections about the ' Comet J were withdrawn. E. HERTSLET.
