The balance in hand at the beginning of the year is only &amp;&gt;. 60,000, and it is hoped that the actual receipts will not fall short of the estimates, particularly the receipts from customs dues. There is reasonable ground to expect increased returns under this head from the outlying ports in view of the closer supervision rendered possible by the purchase of the newly acquired State Patrol Vessel H A1 Saeed', in which Mr. Thomas has already visited Sur and other ports, but there is a tendency to optimism in the budget as pointed out by the Political Agent. 3. I shall shortly be visiting Muscat and will go into the general question with Major Murphy ai?d Mr. Thomas. I am doubtful of the advisability of the State licensing liquor shops on payment owing to its possible efie~ +/- ^ Arab opinion, 4, It will be seen from Mr, Thomas 1 explanatory note that Bs, 93,500 have been ear-marked towards the repayment of the loan from the Government of India, I have etc•, Sd, L.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information and approval of the Hon’ble the Political Resident, the Muscat State ftxggwl Budget for the year 1927. There are no very salient features in the budget but it is an optimistic one. It allows for a general improvement in trade on a moderate scale and it is to be hoped that this will be realized. The Sohar treasury has for the first time been incorporated in Muscat accounts and it is to be hoped that the closer supervision this affords will have a beneficial effect. It is also hoped that the 'Al Saeed M will enable asmall pox, 11. r a larger amount to be realized from places like Sur where at present only a proportion of the legitimate revenue is realized. The finances of the State are on the whole in a satisfactory condition though they still require the closest supervision and scrutiny on the part of the Finance Minister. I have etc., Sd. G. A.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith Budget Estimates of the Muscat State for 1927. I. Your attention is invited to the precarious way in which the Budget balances and the necessity of resisting all measures involving'fresh expenditure, if financial stability is considered of paramount importance.

It is necessary to point out therefore that (a) December Routine Expenditure of approximately Es. 55000 has not been taken cognisance of: it is brought to account in January Accounts.The balance figure requires reducing by this- (b) Dollars in hand at Muscat Treasury are assigned a value in excess of their actual current value by Bs. 10000 approximately. This arises from the fallen price of silver. Thus At the beginning of 1926 100 Dollars - 150 Bs. at the end M « 100 ' * 129 Bs. The former parity was used for the State accounting throughout the year. Consideration of factors (a) and (b) will turn the illusory book balance of Bs. 125534 into the true balance of about Bs. 60000. Ill, In view of (l) the Stated obligation to have in hand on 1st June a balance of Bs. 46740 for repayment to Government of India, and (IT) St&amp;te Expenditure invariably exceeding State Revenue during the first half of the financial year, the balance in hand of Es. 60000 is no more than adequate to ensure the State paying its way during the lean days ahead. ° I have etc•, Sd.

The slump in the price of dates has been very serious for Muscat, as the margin of revenue over expenditure is always so slender. It is fortunate therefore that a recovery in the date market this summer has been observed, and it is hoped that it will be maintained. 3 .

Sir, I have the honour to forward for the information of the Political Resident a report received from the Finance Minister of the Muscat State covering the first 6 months of 1926. 2. It will he noted that Mr. Thomas refers in para 3 to the recent recovery in the date market, which it is hoped will continue. As the revenues of Muscat State depend directly or indirectly to such a large extent on the price of dates this recovery is most satisfactory* 3 . *t will be seen that Mr. Thomas hopes to be able to recover the whole of the amount for which he budgetted as Zakat revenue, which is practically a tax on the date crop, before the end of the year. 4. The protracted tour in the Batinah made during April,May and June by His Highness accompanied by Mr. Thomas appears to have had excellent results. Mr. Thomas informs me that His Highness*s advice and assistance in revenue natters were invaluable. It is a pleasure to find His Highness again taking an interest in affair s. 5 . The registration of dhows which it is hoped to enforce te on the lines of that instituted in the Bahrain islands. 6 . The Steam Launch 'General Elies' is expected to arrive at Muscat in September or October. In order to make her of real value in the collection of Customs revenue it will be necessary that she, just as the former yach^ts belonging to the State, should be armed with a gult I shall meke a separate communication to you in this matter.V 7. The final paragraph of Mr. Thomas* report shows that such matters as the Paris pearl market and the exchange value of the franc exert a ccnsiderabUe influence on the fortunes of a small agricultural state, far removed from the main arteries of world commerce, such as is Muscat. 8 . The finances of the Muscat State have been passing through a time of depression, and it is due to the unceasing vigilance of Mr. Thomas that expenditure has not exceeded revenue to a much larger extent tha/n has been the case.

To The Political Agent and H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat. Financial Report of Muscat State for six months ending 50th June 1926. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith in duplicete a six iron the Statement of Actual Revenues and Expenditure of the Muscat State for the period ending 30th June 1926, and Antici pated Revenues and Expenditure for the remaining half of the current year* 1. Before commenting in detail on the individual chapters of the Statistical Statements, I would remind you of the system. here obtaining of bringing State Expenditure to account a month in arrear which system gives an exaggeratedly substantial appearance to our balance; hence in the summary given at the foot of the Receipts Statement, it should be borne in mind that wherever Balances are stated, it is necessary in each case to deduct a round sum of Rs.55,000 (monthly normal routine expenditureexpenditure) in order to arrive at the true financial position* 2. The State has experienced in the first half of this year an acute trade depression which local opinion says it is necessary to go back ten years to find a parallel for, and which affords an unfortunate contrast with the abnormal prosperity of the year 1925. The immediate cause for this is to be found in the universal slump in the price of dates and also the inability to market the whole of last years Shumailiyah hayvest which customarily is bought up by Dibai almost in its entirety • s As the pur chewing power of the State is determined by the market value of its date harvest the Treasury losses sustained not only in date revenue at the time but Customs import Revenue thereafter, require no elaborate explanation. Money has been very scarce, cultivators have in cases mortgaged this yea^s crop and Zakat farmers have inevitably fallen into arrear with payments due to Government under contracts made in the prosperous times of a year ago. Added to this the Mekran fiscal measure directed against the port of Gwadur and operating since February threatens our revenues there with a loss of 50000 rupees over the whole year. In order to meet these combined denudations I have been obliged to exercise a close financial control, resist all proposals involving new expendi ture, and make drastic economies from tine to time e.g. Public Works, State pensions and contingencies. 3. Revenues. See Statistical Statement. Cahp .1 Chap. 11 No comment. The Actuals for the first six months of this year are Re.282332 as against Rs.367892 for the corresponding half year 1925 i.e. a decrease of Rs. 85560. This serious falling off already referred to is illuminated by a comparison of average local market prices of dates prevailing in the respective years, thus Batinah dry dates Batinah wet dates Shukailiyah wet dates 1925 per bahar Rs.290 ' 85 ' 110 1926 per bahar Rs .250 « 60 ' 70 ItIt will be noticed that I estimate this head to yield Rs.390000 in the ensuing year: this as against Rs.410508 Actuals for the second half of 1925. If this estimate is suspected of an optimism not warranted by the first six months receipts it may be observed that cognisance has been taken of the following new factors. (a) There has been a recent recovery in the date market which merchants are generally of opinion will be sustained. (t)) I have recently established three new Customs posts in the Shumailiyah which should produce annually not less than Rs.12000. (c) The prospective* Dhow Registration Tax should if sanctioned, produce Rs.5000 in a normal ye ar • Chap.Ill The slight falling off in landing charges follows natural -ly from shrinkage in trade. This is not an important revenue item, as the sums so received are handed over to the landing contractor less only 5% deducted for manage ment expenses. See note Chapter V expenditure which follows. Cahp.IV. Zakat revenue being almost exclusively a date revenue has been primarily affected by the acute situation. The figure of Rs.870 shown in the Statement as against Rs.76000 budgetted for the year is however illusory. The Actuals so far it is not convenient to show for the following reason. Some 70^ of Zakat revenues are collected in the Shumailiyah province the headquarters of which is Sahar. On account of the remoteness of the district from Muscat Sahar maintains its own Treasury . Local Zakat revenues are paid into this and from it all current administration expenses of the four wilaiyate of Sahar, Saham, Liwa and Shinas are met. At the end of the year adjustment can be made by bringing Shumail 13 -ah revenue srevenues and expenditure to account under their proper heads in the Muscat Treasury Accounts. There has been considerable leakage in Sahar revenues in the past and the Shumailiyah reorganisation I recently carried out has for its object the remedying of this. Chaps. 7,71,711 ind 7111 Sahp.IX. No comment. The falling off under this head is due to the drying up of the Government garden felej at Wataiyah. The decay of this felej is an instance of the fate overtaking most felejes of interior Oman. Desiccation - the people bemoan 1 the dwindling rainfall year by year an accelerating process | 8 aid to date from 1915 - is driving the date palm of the upland wadis out of cultivation and the cultivators from their ancient habitations. There has been a steady exodus of tribesmen to the -Batinah and to Zanzibar* The jli inevitable dimlshing wealth and purchasing power of the thirsting interior is a factor to heed in any future computation of the State’s taxable capacity. yvo _ * IT n V T X fTVU A ~ mi ei earHno* unlepB read in conjunction with unimportant.

See note under Revenue Statement Chapter XII. 5. Reference to the summary of the general financial position given at the foot of the Revenue Statement will show an antici pated slump in our reserve for the whole year of Rs.50000. Against this we shall hold 36000 rupees in capital value as represented by the _ . , iT . 330 OO Bps. Patrol Ship 33000 Bps. State Barge 3000 InIn view of the lean year through which we are passing this position, if realised, may he regarded as a satisfactory one. I have on a previous occasion pointed out that the unprece dented financial obligations imposed on the State by the concurrent (a) Maintenance of Muscat Infantry (■b) M M patrol vessel (c) Refunding of the Government of India loan make the balancing of the Budget even in a normal year a precarious matter. It would appear from the financial crises which have overtaken the State since 1920 that the Scale of Ruling Family and Military Expenditure (the two Chief major heads) decided upon at that time in the light of an artificial prosperity following the raising of a loan of six lakhs, is slightly in advance of the capacity of the State to bear in a normal year. This scale of expenditure has now come to be regarded as irreducible, though in a lean year it is relatively excessvie. The alternative is to increase revenue; and to this end the two measures introduced during the past six months, namely (1) reorganisation of Shumailiyah Sakat (2) establishment of three new customs posts should be supplemented in the second half of the year by (1) a Dhow Registration tax (2) an attempt to take a proper share of customs duties from Sur (this manifestly a thorny problem). Notwithstanding these additional sources of revenue the State should continue I opine to eschew all proposals involving new expenditure. The economic factors making for a good revenue year are (I) good date crop in the Batinah and Shumailiyah, (II) heavy rains in the interior, (III) failure of date crop of rival Basrah, (IV) high world market prices of dates, (V) Prosperity of Dihai (a considerable secondary ' V) market) which arises from a good pearl harvest there, and this in turn depends upon the Parpearl market - a consideration not unconnected with the exchange value of the franc. ’Shen as in the past year there is a combination of circumstances in the reverse sense, Miiscat revenues must inevitably suffer and steps be taken anticipatorily to ensure rigid economy.

In particular this officer will function as Finance Minister, but he will also have a full share in the Govern meat of the State. His Highness 1 brother, Caiyid Nadir, will continue to be President of the Council. 2. As, from Muscat Diary Entries, I have noticed that the State indulges a good deal in the according of salutes to Members of the State Council, Maiis and relatives of the Sultan, I asked the Political Agent to inform me what Q \ 32 %he Pules of the State are in this connection. He has replied that salutes from the Sultan’s battery are given to Ministers whenever they return to Headquarters from pA x State duty and to Walis visiting Muscat if they areare brothers of His Highness. It may be added, that the heir-apparent also gets a salute, o. As regards salutes from a British Government vessel, if his Highness is in residence, no salute is given to the State Council or to individual ministers. In the Sultan*s absence, the President of the Council, or two or more Ministers collectively,would, at the conclusion of an official visit on board, receive a Salute. The possibility of a single Haslr representing the State on official business is very remote. That Mr. Thomas should not be the minister in question can be definitely safeguarded against. 4.

Mr. Bower also strongly advocated the same course. The presence of a steamer is calculated to enhance me State’s prestige everywhere, buu particularly at sur, where Government authority is as feeeble as in years past, and vnere experuiiture still exceeds revenue. Information said to be credible, puts customs leakage at sur at over SO % ana given efficient, collections increased revenue there nay reasonably be expected to cover largely the costs of running the patrol vessel. At all events it is certain that without some such craft local Government's prestige ana finances are not susceptible of any considerable improvement, in framing the Estimates 1 have refrained from putting Sur’s revenue possibilities, vis -a-vis the prospective patrol vessel, too high. An extra Rs.20,000/- from Customs there may be regarded as not an extravagant anticipation, mis and a small increase of Rs. bp 00 /- anticipated from a reorganisation of Shamaliyah Customs are the only serious departures from tnis year’s revenue actuals. As regards expenditure, me allotment of Be.60,000/- under Marine is a new ana serious commitment, it is however calculated to prove Productive Expenditure and nono less than Hs. 27,00c/- of it represents Capioal and Non-Hecurrent expenditure* ±hat it is wnoily u) be met from current 1926 revenues without resulting in a Budget deficit at the end of the year, my be regarded as a justification for the measure. me proposed extensive Public works program also calls for comment. For many years past Government forts up and down thfc cost-at one time handsome and imposing buildings and dating from the Portuguese occupation - have had no money spent on them, and are fast falling to pieces, those at Buwaiq and ms ana' ah 1 found U) be as dilapidated as Jalali Fort in Muscat; but the provincial forts being small they can be repaired at moderate cost. The fort at Khabura had been so much neglected as to have become irreparable, and nas been abandoned. As these forts are head-quarters of District Government i-e., are used as residences and offices by the various .alls io would, apart from the question of prestige, be uneconomi cal to p rmit their decay and later as a result be committed to heavy expenditure on new Government buildings. Comparison of estimated Receipts and Kstimated expenditure may be deemed to show a margin too narrow to accommodate possible 'Unforeseen Expenditure', in that case curtailment could be made umer one or more of the following heads at the time the necessity arises, (1) Chapter ill Cutting down the steamer's pabrois to reduce coal consumption. ^2) ' vin deducing the Public works Program. ^ 3 j » n Kconomising unaer Military Expenditure.

The opening balance therefore did not show the true financial condition of th State at the end of the year.

Before referring to th* statistical Statements in d*tail OAacL there are two outstanding s*rious features to which attention should be called. (ij The illusory and misleading nature of the balance of iis. 124438/- brought forward from 1924. (2) The Excess of Expenditure over neceipts of ms. 19666/- for the six months ending 3uth Jure 1925* 1. 3alsnc*s at the foot of Revenue Statement ar* as follows Balancefcs.1,24,438 1,04,772 1,50,322 Balanco brought forward from 1924. Balance on 30th June 1925, Anticipated Balance on 31st DAcsmb^r 1925. ! These balances are apparent and not real. This is due to the practice which obtained h*re, end which I have continued to ooserve, of Printing certain iajor Expenditure e.g., Oivi 1 List, Lilitary, Adninistrative otaff etc., to account a month in arrear Thus ? t was that December 1924 pay und^r these heads was met ani accounted ior not in December 1924 but in January 1925. The oalaice of ns. 1,24,438/- was in fact the book balance on 31st Uecemoer last of neceipts over Expenditure brought to account: between 1st January 1924 and 31st December 1924. This balance must not be identified with financial conoition of the otate at th« °nb of the year. In reality it represents Dtate revenue received to the eid of December less State liabilities (at least under major heads) to the o^d of November only. To arrive at the actual financial position of the State at the end of last year therefore cognisance must be taken of th«se 'carried forward* December charges amounting in all to Rs. 69,237/- The true surplus will then be seen to have b*en ris.55,20l/- only and not Rs. 1,24,438/-. The same anplies to the balance on 30th June 1925. June pay u her the heads in question amounting to ns^Sya^w- has not been taken into consideration as i t was met on 1st July and will be brou^t to account in July accounts. The true balance is there fore not .1,04,772/- but Rs.40,249/- only. The systan whereby such expeiaiture is carried forward from the month to which it pertains to the month following, while not opm to objection from an accounting point of view, inevitably gives rise to swollen and unreal paper balances which in turn lead to a false sense of stability and loose so ending. To remedy this it would b* necessary to bring seven months expenditure to account ^n the remaining six months of the year.

Sir, 1 have the honour to submit the half yearly state ments of the Muscat State finances showing the financial position of the State at the close of the year 1924. 2. The year opened with a balance of Rs.49,527 and closed with a balance of Rs.1,24,438. The revenue for the year under report was Rs.10,85,610 as against a total of Rs.9,30.811 collected in 1924. The increase this year appears chiefly due to better administrative control over the Customs and also in part to the fact that the Wall of Sohar has been made to render accounts instead of appropriating all the Customs revenue of that pert. 3. The port of Sur is the only one which shows a notable decrease in the amount of duty collected. This was Rs.50,726 in 1923, while during the year under report the collections totalled Rs.37,459 only, a decrease of Rs.13,267. This state of affairs is due entirely to the loss of power of control by the Muscat Government and it seems wonderful that any revenue at all is recovered from that place. 4. Trade in general appears to have been normal during 1924 and there are no special points needing particular mention. Iskander Effendi, the Director General of Customs, and Liakat Ali, Treasurer, have worked extremely well, and it is to them that credit is due for the vastly improved condition of Muscat finances. 1 have,etc., 3d/- C.G.Crosthwaite, Lieut.Colonel, Political Agent and H.B.M 1 s Consul, Muscat.The Consulate, Muscat r 1)6 Oman, L.

I have the honour to forward, herewith, the customary half-yearly statements of the Muscat State Finances showing the actual revenue and expenditure under the Budget heads for the first six months of the year and the estimated expenditure for the remainder of the year. 2. On the face of them the statements appear to be satisfactory—more satis factory than for several years back—but I am not certain that the Finance Depart ment of H. H.’s Government has not on the crest of a wave of optimism estimated the revenue for the latter half of the year at rather a high figure. However if the figures are a fair estimate Muscat stands to have a surplus of revenue over expenditure for the whole year of something approaching three quarters of a lakh of rupees. 3. I will now proceed to comment on the various items on the revenue side. Actual revenue from the Customs set ms to have worked out fairly accurately to the estimate but it should be remembered that of the four big consignments of rice from India which arrive yearly three have already come and we only expect one more. To balance this we have had one oil ship in this month and expect another shortly. I should say the receipts for Muscat are slightly below what they ought to be and those for Matrah about correct. Gwadur has produced its quota but there is no doubt we are losing heavily on the outlying customs. This however is a } olitical matter and is being taken up separately. The landing revenue has increased considerably and this of course argues an increase of trade but the item itself does not improve the position as all but a very small percentage is paid out again to the Contractor. Zakat revenue is all payable in the second half of the year the amount already received representing arrears from last year. Quarantine shows a considerable decrease but here again the latter half of the year should be more profitable as many people return to Muscat in August and September. The Miscellaneous item includes rents from Government gardens, hire of the stone quarry, municipal taxes in Matrah, Beit al Mai, passport and court fees ard other minor sources of revenue. It is a difficult one to estimate and on going into the figures it appears to me we have been unduly optimistic to the extent of some Rs. 5,000. This revenue is collected practically entirely in the latter half of the year and I shall have an opportunity of commenting on and explaining it then. The dollar still keeps up and a small increase has been registered on this account. Sahar Revenue is a new item. It was included under Sahar Customs before and represents the income from the Government lands in the vicinity of that place. As it is the first year it has been made a separate item. I presume we must excuse the Finance Minister for being so much out in his estimate which shows a probable loss of nearly Rs. 9,000. 4. There are not many comments to make on the expenditure side. The deaths of one or two of the Ruling Family will result in a slight saving on that item. Sayud Saeed has not spent quite as much up till now as usual and the adrainistir- ti\e cnarges show a decrease of over Rs. 1,000 due mainly to Sahar being differently accounted for as explained above. Customs con ingencies are down at present by a considerable sum due mainly to repairs to buildings not having been carried out; Military expenditure shows a saving of Rs. 8,000 in part due to the saving on the Commandant’s pav during the period between Captain Alban’s departure and the arrival of Captain Eccles and partly to less capital expenditure during the first half of the year on eouipment, etc., for the Muscat Infantry. There is also a small saving on the pav of the personnel as numbers have been cut down to nearly two hundred. Miscellaneous and Sahar both show up badly. The remarks on these items as appeared on the revenue side apply here also. /akat claims have been extinguished and this item will not appear in future. present 6 P ° llCe Sclieme tas fallen tllr0ll g h and will not be proceeded with for the MC6S0FD5 . The position under the prevailing conditions is not too unsatisfactory but as the statements show we are living entirely from hand to mouth and the effect of abolishing the post of Financial Adviser has not yet been felt. The Minister of Finance, Sayed Mahomed bin Hamad is completely illiterate and any accurate arithmetical statement is entirely beyond him but I have had considerable assistance from Iskander Effendi, the Egyptian Director of Customs and also from Syed Liaqat Ali, the Treasury Officer. The former has been a tower of strength since he became Director and it is safe to say that without his energy and probity of character the entire customs fabric, and with it the main revenue of the State, would collapse. 6 . In conclusion I may say that provided the price of dates keeps up and nothing untoward happens Muscat should be able to carry on (but with no margin for emergencies) until the proposed new arrangements for administration come into force.

It is very unfortunate tE4t circumstances beyond 5 our control have prevented us till row from finding a suitable Financial Adviser for the State. We would have been delighted to have Mr. Bower 6 last January, but he could not postpone his leave to England. The Sultan asked in torch for a Mr.Murray of Iraq; we were told in April that this officer was medical ly unfit. We were then offered by Sir H.Dobbs a Mr. Monk, Director of Customs at Basrah,who however could only join in November. Then Sir A.T.Wilson recommended to us a Mr. B.S.Thomas, O.B.E. ,now Assistant British Representa tive in Trans-Jordania,who could reach Muscat for duty about September next. This gentleman has taken short leave from Amman and has intefviewed me. He is now in India where he will see the Sultan and Major Hinde. He was formerly a District Revenue Officer in Iraq and has a very good reputation as an all round capable man. he Unfortunately xtfxhas done no Customs work . 7 . I was expediting to be in a position in a few days time to submit to you Mir. Thomas* name as the most suit able candidate for Muscat we can find. InIn the meantime,however, I have received your teleg ram No.749-X dated the nth July 1924, offering Mr.Bowers services from 1st December. 1 am discussing this proposal with the Political Agent ana will telegraph my views very shortly. S. Major Hinde has deprecated Mr. Bower’s deputation 'on the ground of insufficient scope'. I am inclined to think that the Political Agent may be underestimating the possibilities of improvement which a Customs expert can devise,and that If Mr. Thomas can retain his present appointment at Amman until say,next April, it will be most advantageous that we should entrust the re-organi- least zation of the Customs at frssctt to Mir. Bower,and then employ Mr. Thomat- if in the meanwhile he has found favour with the Sultan-to carry on the good work. CflaliAentiai,. Copy of a letter No. C. 15.R., dated Srinagar, the 9th June 1924, from Major R.G.Hinde,I.A.,Political Agent, to Muscat,(on recess)^Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to your endorsement No. 254-S of the 2nd May 1924, covering a copy of the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the &gt; Foreign and Political Department's memorandum No.749-X, dated Simla,the 17th April 1924. 2. I presume that,as the view of the Government of India as expressed in the above-quoted memorandum is labelled provisional, it is liable to modification and, therefore, I propose to reiterate my previous views that, failing the Government of India refusing entirely to entertain the ideas of remitting the repayment of the loan for five years or increasing the Sultan's subsidy, the only real remedy for Muscat's financial ills is to arrangearrange for an increase in the Customs Duty, The other economic proposals are really merely palliatives and ao not strike at the heart of the problem, 3. i will take the paragraphs as they stand in the memorandum. (a) Excise licenses have not yet been carried into effect. It appears that all that would be required in the case of Muscat subjects would be a procla mation by the Sultan,but this would be useless if British subjects were not compelled to take out similar licenses at the same time„and a King’s Regulation would be required for this.Colonel Trevor promised to look up the machinery for the issue of a King’s Regulation and the scheme was postponed pending a communication from Bushire. The commodities proposed to be included under Excise licenses were wines and spirits (Rs.500 p.a.) and opium and preparations of hemp (Rs .1000 p.a.) and I estimated the total financial effect at about Rs.1500 annually. The Municipal house tax was to have been carried into effect in Matrah by Captain Alban and as far as Arab subjects were concerned was,I believe, started but some doubt arose as to whe ther or no a King's Regulation would be necessary here also as most of the revenue would come from very British subjects. Captain Alban was xkjcx ill for I the last four months he was at Muscat,and I fear the matter slipped my memory. In any case the revenue from both the above taxes would be extremely small and would hardly affect Muscat's financial position. The camel tax was brought into operation,but after a spirited protest from the Omanis,Colonel Trevor, while at Muscat,ordered me verbally to advise the Muscat Government to drop it as it might lead to a renewalrenewal of the ill-feeling between Muscat and the Omanis. This was done from April 1st and it was a natter of considerable regret to me as it was then bringing in about Rs400 a month and would have produced considerably more in the date harvest sea son. (b) With regard to the proposed increase in Custons duty fy may I point out that the 5 % rate was fixed in 1891- 55 years ago- and 1 think I am right in asserting that every country which has a system of tariffs(and India itself is no exception)has increased its rates within that period. It is not, therefore, an unfair request to make to the other countries concerned,and short of perennial and financial aid, which is unde sirable from many points of view,is,to my mind,the only possible way of balancing the Muscat Budget. It should be remembered that the customs are the only way the Omanis can be compelled to contribute to the Muscat Government revenues and that they frop the main source of revenue of the &amp;tate. The only other tax which is collected is the date harvest tax (zakat) and that is open to so many abuses that it does not produce the revenue it should do. A reorganisation of it was begun by Captain Alban but it entails a detailed survey of all the date groves and cannot be complete for some time. I think it should be borne in mina that the raising of the Customs dues would not materially affect France or America as the import trade from the one is r&gt;j.l and from the other so small and so indirect as to be practically negligible. (c) Rfimi.6sj.QrL oL rejayment . .oi 1 . tfr.e. loa n, lor, five I suggested this as I considered it would give us time to search about for other sources of revenues .The discovery of oil Vv’as what I had in mind at the time. The remission will come automatically, I pre sume, if matters go on as they are at present. (d) Seducti on of. It appears that Colonel Trevor and I misunder stood the Sultan’s attitude on the subject of halving his privy purse. As he has explained to me since, what he meant was that, if while he was away from Muscat,the Treasury became empty,he was willing to let half his salary lapse in order temporarily to stave off a financial crisis. Ke denies that he ever intended to surrender voluntarily and permanently Hs.5000 a month. He says he could not in any case offer to submit to a lesser income while at Muscat, as there he is subject to heavy calls on his purse from the many descendants la main gauche' of his forbears and from outlying chiefs who demand his hospitality. In any case I would not recommend any reduction in his purse as it would quite possibly lead to an immediate renewal of his previous idea of abdication and it is to be remembered that he is after all an independent ruling sovereign, and as such can hardly be expected to keep up his position on anything smaller than his present income. (e) ft eduction of the. Mug gat.JLg viM^ The strength of this force v/as originally fixed at 300 but owing to financial stringency it has already been reduced to a trifle over 200 and I have further ordered the new Commandant not to enlist any more until it is down to the latter figure,which is in my opinion the lowest possible compatible with safety. The Sultan’s authority is to my mind largely dependent on the existence of a suitable striking force in the vicinity of Muscat,and if it should be possible to station detachments of this force at or near the other coast tovms under adequateadministration to support the authority of the local Walls 1 xftix think we should find a considerable improve ment in Government and most probably an increase in revenue. We should seek therefore rather to augment the State Forces in order to ensure that local authorities' hands are strong end£h to cope with incipient disorder (this applies particularly to Sur) and thatthe Central Government be in a position to insist on satisfactory administration in the outlying towns. May I correct the mis-apprehension of its being an alien force ? True, it is largely composed of Baluchis, descendants of previous immigrants from the opposite coast and subject of His Highness. There are some Baluch from Gwadur District, which, incidentally, is also an appanage of Muscat,and a. few Yemenis from near Aden but otherwise it is in all senses a national and not an alien force. (f) Incre ase. In, th e , Sultan . 1 6 subsidy, I suggested this more as a means of driving home the seriousness of the financial situation at Muscat than anything else. I am not in favour of anything in the shapVe of doles whenever they can be avoided. It would be preferable to see Muscat stand firmly on its own feet than existing on the bounty of a foreign Government. Colonel Trevor suggested this as Mr. Bower had made such an improvement in the Bahrain Customs but matters are rather different in Muscat. I do not think the State is losing much on the central customs, which are under the control of an able Egyptian, but probably there is a certain amount of loss on the outlying ones, the control and inspection of which depend more on political factors and adequate and rapid means of transport rather than on system and organisation.4. To sum up uhe points of the rtove-quofecl memorandum; paragraph (a) is partly nearly negligible in effect and partly found impracticable, (d) is unde/sirable,and { e) inadvisable: (g) seems unnecessary and the Government of India do not wish to accede to (b), (c) or (f) except as last resources, (h) is agreed on but its financial effect will not be immediately apparent. 5. In the circumstances the estimate of the immediate future financial situation remains as previously described by ray predecessor and myself, that is to say we may look to a crisis occurring before very long. I find ohat in 1922 the bt r ‘.te lost It lakhs of rupees, in 1923 1 lakh and this year the deficit can hardly be less than % of a lakh. This will by the end of the year leave Muscat without any balance in hand and as the current revenue is not suffi cient for the expenditure, which under the present administration cannot,! believe, be reasonably reduced, f there can be only one result, namely, bankruptcy. This year we ought just to weather, helped by the present high rate of the dollar and the prospects of a fair date crop. I have also hopes that the appointment of the new European Finance Minister may alter the situation materially but, as 1 pointed out above, I do not think he can be expected to improve the position much in the immediate future.

Sd. A.P.Trevor, Lieutenant-Colonel. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Confidential. Copy of a letter No.38-1. ,d ..ted 18th Imrch 1924,from the Hon’ble Hie Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political department. I h ve the honour to report, for the information of tne Government of India,that on the 16th March I p* id a visit to Muscat in the course of which I paid a farewell can on His Highness the Sultan,in tne course of which a variety of subjects was discussed. 2. Some time before,the Political Agent, had told- me that since his return from Dhofar at the end of January His Highness had frequently enquired when I might be expected to visit Muscat as he ,had a communication to make to me ;he would not however say anything to the Political Agent on the subject. I consequently expected His Highness to say something of a confidential nature,and expected he would raise the question oi his .jdication again. 2 ^ /if ter a good deal of conversation about his sta^ in DhofarDhofar nd the a.ture of that province ind its inh* hitnnts His Highness c me to his confidential communication. At first he dilated a good deal on the worries and troubles of government,saying that he had no desire to rule etc,, and I thought he would definitely put forward the idea of abdicating, so I said that I hoped he would continue to bear the burden and carry on the government 'until his son became old enough to take over the reins. His Highness said that he would,and I then gathered that what he wanted to say was not so much the question of abdicating as of obtaining Government's recognition of his son as his successor. I reminded His Highness that this question had already been laid before Government who had decided that they could not officially recognise his son as successor. I added that in such cases my own practice was to recognise informally as heir the son or other relative recognised by the actual ruler as his heir,and I thought Government took the same line 'unless the character or behaviour of the heir was such as to prevent their doing so: I felt sure that Government granted the same amount of informal recognition of his son Sayyid Saeed as they had done in his own case when his father the late Sultan Faisal considered him the heir. His Highness seemed perfectly satisfied with this. Kis Highness then went on to say 7 ' onao he couln find no suitable person in the State to advise nim in reforming the administration,and keeping the finances straight,when he was ore sent 4*^ Muscat, and when he was not pie sent m galvanize the Council of Ministers into li-e. His H±gn- ness ewid that the members of the Council,though very worthy persons,were absolutely useless as adminisorator^, apart from which they would never come so a decision about 'my matter.even unimportant questions,*M persisted inleaving everything over to await his return. In this I cordially agree,though,of course, I did not say so. His Highness said that he wanted to get -an Englishman who would advise him when in Muscat and during his absence 'run' the Council of Ministers, hould Government give him a man ? I said I thought it might excite unfavourable comment if Government actually appointed an officer as Ytazir or Finance Member of the Council which was what I thought he required. I thought it better that I,or rather my successor, should make enquiries and see if a suitable man could be found. If so he could visit His Highness at Dehra Dun (where he intends to go at the beginning of May for about five months),and His Highness could see if he liked the applicant and if his temperament and conduct seemed Suitable; if so His Highness could bring him back when he returned in October under contract as Financial Adviser with the prospect of becoming Minister of Finance if he proved suitable and worked satisfactorily, \fter some discussion His Highness said that if a suitable man presented himself he could engage him as Secretary in India and see haw he shaped,whether his manners and treat ment of Orientals seemed likely to satisfy Arabs etc; if &amp; so he would bring the man up. I said that I thougnt Mmt to attract a suitable man it would &gt;e necessary to at least 1500/- but more probably Hs.2000/- per mensem with ho ase ■ -nd tr : ve11ing aliowance etc., mid Aded that this would be s severe strain on the fin.nees of the Muscat MV te . His iii^mess a _ e he could secure a suitable man his pay up to iCCO/- a month f ed and said that if only he would gladly pay half rom the privy purse. I said this was a generous offer and I tnought that the Sa te Treasury could easily bear the other half, while on the subject of the State Fin rices and the existing stringency, His Highness stated that he would be gl d cu rej-uiiu h-lf his monthly allowances to the uu te during his s^ay in ,rnd live there onRs.SGCC/-. I said this was a very ^enerous Ind iagenerous offer on His Hi rehabilitatinp; the St te ghness 1 part and would' go far to finances* His Highness then ra id ‘ that on his voyage up met an officer who had person. He was then or from India about a year ago he had seemed to him ^o he a very suitable hud recently been employed in the Iraq Customs 'Department,he could not remember the officer’s nune but believed he had his visiting card s could find it. I s id that if he could find omewhere if he and send me the visiting card or the officer's name I would endeavour to trice him and ascertain if he was suitable and qualified to undertake the ioh,and willing to take service with the ^uscat State;and let Kis Highness know the result. v&lt; e then had some conversation as to what the position of the English Member of the Council would be vis a vis His Highness' brother Sayyid Nadir; I was inclined uo think it would be very difficult but His Highness thought he could easily arrange matters so that their relations would be on a satisfactory footing. His Highness said that Saiyid Nadir’s sole idea was to avoid responsibility and put every thing off till the Sultan*s return, he thought that if Saiyid Nadir found he had a colleague who would take responsibility and do things he would be only too glad to leave natters in his hands. I think the Sultan’s proposal, in the form it emerged from this conversation,to try and find a suitable English man who would take service with him and run the State finances is a good one. His Highness harped a good deal on his desire only to do what was right in the eyes of the British Government,and said he particularly wished to avoid getting an Englishman who would not work cordially with the Political Agent; he wanted a nan who would be guided by the Political Agent’s advice when necessary and who would guide his policy on lines ‘ greeable to uhe British Government. Should a suitable man be found and engaged as Finance Member of uhe Council, it will of course be unnecessary for che Commandant of the Levy Corps to be Financial Adviser. It seems possible that Captain ilbt n, Nil present Commandant, willwill shortly he given no the r appointment. If so I think that his successor might he simply Command-mt of the Levy Corps and his staff p : y reduced^/to say Hs.400/- per mensem. If His Highness sends me the card of the officer he met last year I will endeavour to trace him; if not I pro pose to make enquiries with a view to finding a suitable man. If one is found I will instruct him to visit the Sultan it Jehra Dun. If the Sultan approves of him it would he easy for His Highness in consultation with the Political Agent, who coaid if necessary visit His Highness while on recess, to make a suitable contract.CONF IDENT ML.

The provisional views of the Government of India on the various points referred to therein are as follows (a) Increase m Excise Licenses.Municipal and Camel Taxes.

Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Ptesi- dent, Persian Gulf. Muscat Finances. I have the honour to invite a reference to Memorandum No. 749-X., dated 1st October 1923 (Serial No. 3), from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department calling for my views on the questions raised by Mr. Wingate in his letter No. 18-R., dated 21st August 1923 (Enclosure of Serial No. 1). 2. I have delayed replying to the abovementioned Memorandum until I had an opportunity of visiting Muscat, and this I have now done, having been there on the 5th and 6th December. While at Muscat I discussed the question of the Muscat Finances thoroughly with the Political Agent and the Financial Adviser. I am afraid the financial position of the Muscat State is not at all good. As Mr. Wingate pointed out in his letter above- mentioned there is a progressive decline in Muscat Customs receipts of nearly a lakh per annum. This undoubtedly points to a considerable decrease in trade, but that it means an absolutely corresponding decrease in trade I am by no means so sure. The Council recently felt constrained to dismiss the second of the Egyptian Directors for inefficiency—the first one having volun tarily retired some little time before and I think that without doubt a proportion of the Customs Revenue has been and is being lost through ineffi ciency and possibly dishonesty. Further I believe we have the means of remedying this to our hand. 3. Mr Bower who was originally deputed to reorganize the Bahrain Customs will have finished his job there before the end of January, and his deputation has recently been extended for another 3 months to try and settle the Kuwait Nejd Customs difficulties. It has, however, been apparent for some time that Shaikh Ahmed has no desire to settle these difficulties, and just recently Bin Saud has replied to Colonel Knox’s suggestion for settle ment to the effect that he has no desire to do so either. It is thus useless to retain Mr. Bower for the service for w T hich his additional period of deputa tion was sanctioned. I understand that Mr. Bower’s services are not required for the moment in India and that he has been promised leave in the Spring In the circumstances he will apparently be more or less free for 2| months—from say 14th January to 28th March, and I venture to ask that he may be deputed to inspect and if time permits to reorganize the Muscat and Oman Customs Department. Though I do not dare to hope for such a large increase—averaging Rs. 1,150 per diem—in receipts as he has achiev ed at Bahrein. I fancy Mr. Bower could make a considerable improvement. In present conditions, however, Muscat certainly cannot afford to pay him his salary of Rs. 2,000 per mensem : perhaps the i^tate could pay half. If Mr. Bower could achieve a substantial increase in Customs revenue of course the State could pay up the balance. I venture to ask whether Gov ernment would be prepared to pay Mr. Bower his salary and allowances while at Muscat on the scale on which he is being paid at Bahrain, and allow the Muscat State to pay it back if and when its Customs revenues have increased as a result of Mr. Bower’s efforts. I feel almost certain that Mr Bower’s deputation would result in an immediate increase of Customs receipts, and that in the end the Muscat State would be able (as of course it should do) to pay for his deputation. 4 If Mr Bower’s services can be utilised in this way and he is will ing to tackle the Muscat Customs problems, I feel sure as mentioned above, a considerable increase of revenue will result. While at Muscat I went into the possibility of raising revenue by other taxes. The only other taxes which could be suggested were (1) Excise Licenses for spirits opium and allied drugs. (2) Municipal tax on house holders m Muttrah and (3) Octroi on all camels coming into Muttrah from the intevior, and I instructed the Financial Adviser to go into these and see whether they were feasib e and what revenue they were likely to produce—nothing very much, I fear, less than + a lakh all told. ENc. ,n ' 7 A FC:»-h’lQ.jy- ^cmrjrY’r- - r : ' 3M EJ Tj* r .... j— 5. I attach for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter from the Financial Adviser together with its enclosure a statement showino- the actual revenue of Muscat State from 1st January 1 - -d, t° 30th November 1923, together with the estimated revenue for December 1923. This shows that there will be a deficit on this year s working oi Ls. l,0o,272^ in spite of expenditure being reduced to the lowest possible level I rather j fear that the improved Customs Revenue and the result of the above taxes will hardly coyer this deficit, and in any case will not be sufficient to place Muscat State Finances on a sound footing. 0. It results from the above that it will be necessary either to increase revenue permanently or reduce expenditure very considerably. 1 he first can only be done, as far as I can see, by raising the V valorem of customs duty from 5 per cent, to 7^ per cent, or even 10 per cent. It w ill be remember ed that when I was at Muscat in 1910 the late Sultan Sayyid Faisal denounc ed the Commercial Treaty of 1891 simply with a view to getting the Customs duty raised to 7-i- per cent., and to do this is practically the only object to revisino- the Treaty. The Customs revenue would of course be nearly doubled if the rate were raised to 10 per cent, though perhaps not quite as volume of import might be reduced. I very much doubt, ho'we’ver, whether it would be suitable to raise the rate of duty in the manner suggested by Mr. Wingate without previous reference to France and America who have treaties with Muscat which also fix rate of Customs duty at 5 per cent. point, how ever, is one for the Government of India or His Majesty’s Government to decide, I am not qualified to express any useful opinion on the subject. 7. In regard to reduction of expenditure the only thing I can suggest is to reduce Idle Sultan s Privy Purse from Rs. 10,000 a month to 5,000 temporarily and with the proviso that the difference will be made good at all events for the period H. H. is in Muscat if and when the State Finances permit. The only other relief in expenditure which I can suggest is within the power of the Government of India to accord and might take the form O'.— (a) a remission of repayment of the loan or at all events a postpone ment of the repayment of instalments for say 5 years; or (b) a contribution to the cost of the Levy Corps; or (c) an increase in the subsidy. Of these I think (c) may be ruled out straight away. In favour of (b) it may be urged that the institution of the Levy Corps has saved the Govern ment of India the very large expenditure involved in keeping a regiment at Muscat. On the whole, however, I consider (a) much the best course and recommend it to the Government of India for favourable consideration 8. If the Government of India are disposed to consider this proposi tion favourably I beg to recommend— (1) the deputation of Mr. Bowmr for 2^ months to inspect Muscat Customs and see if there is any method of increasing receipts; (2) the introduction of the taxes mentioned yielding perhaps 1 rather than less than ^ a lakh per annum; CS) the temporary reduction of the Sultan’s civil list to 60,000 per annum; (4) the suspension by the Government of India of the repayment of the loan for 5 years or till such time as the Muscat Finances have been rehabilitated sufficiently to enable the State to con tinue repayments of the loan. It is possible that the measures suggested in Sections (1), (2) and (3) above wull result in sufficient increase of revenue and decrease of expendi ture to enable the repayments of the loan to be reecommenced within the next year or two. 9. In the meanwhile the Government of India and His Majesty’s Gov ernment will perhaps be pleased to consider the question of agreeing to an increase of the rate of Customs Duty; this can be done in connection with the Revision of the Commercial Treaty which has now been on the tapis,3 but hanging fire, for several years. If they decide to agree to an increase in the rate of duty no doubt they will consider the question of arranging the matter with the French and American Governments before the final draft of the revised Treaty is approved. 10. In regard to the suggestion made by Mr. Wingate to put a definite term to our practically direct control of Muscat, I venture to think that it is useless to put a definite term to this until there are more signs than appear at present that the Muscat Government is capable of standing by itself. Letter No. F. A. 18, dated 4th December 1923. From—Captain R. G. Alban, Financial Adviser, Muscat State, To—The Political Agent and H. M.’s Consul, Muscat. In continuation of my No. F. A. 7, dated 4th August 1923, to your office I have the honour to submit a further statement of the finances of the State. 3^ The accompanying figures show (a) the actual revenue and expenditure from January 1st to November 30th 1923 and (b) the probable figures for December 1923, together with the totals and the probable balance on Decem ber 31st. 1 should like to point out that in the year 1922 the year’s working showed a deficit of Rs. 1,59,900. At the end of 1923 there will be a deficit of Rs. 1,05,272, this in spite of expenditure being reduced almost to its lowest level and every attempt made to increase the income of the State. It is clear that at this rate, with a probable balance of Rs. 58,428 at the end of the year, we shall be in a position to carry on through 1924. Should the Government of India decide to increase the Customs duty to 10 per cent, it would mean at least Rs. 7,00,000 extra yearly revenue to the State. This would do away with all financial difficulty and allow of a certain sum being saved on each year’s working. Except for the above remarks I have nothing further to add to my last report.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to the concluding paragraph of my letter No.72-S., dated 10th February 1923, dealing with the question of the repayment of Zakat claims of British subjects. The claimants, 22 in number, having all accepted £ of their claims in full settlement in consideration of prompt payment, have now been paid by the Muscat Government, wi uh the exception of Parsomal Damodhar who is away from Muscat. The amount of his claim is in deposit in the State Treasury and will be paid to him on his return. This long outstanding question has therefore at last been satisfactorily settled. I have, etc., Sd.

With reference to my letter No. 72-S., dated the 10th February 1923, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a letter (No. 18-R., dated the 31st August 1923), from the Political Agent, Muscat, reporting on the condition of the State finances during the first half of 1923 and submitting a revised estimate of income and expenditure for the whole year. 1 . . . 2. The Political Agent’s report shows a satisfactory reduction in expendi ture, as compared' with the original estimates at the beginning of the year, but it also records a marked decrease in revenue which, in the opinion of the Political Agent, is due to : — (i) the low price of Muscat dates on the Bombay market, and (w) a general decrease in the trade of Muscat, which is evidenced by the fall in Customs revenue at Muscat and Muttrah. 3. The Political Agent’s proposals for restoring the economic problem of the State raises exceedingly large questions—practically a reversal of our policy in Muscat for the past one hundred years. In the absence of Mr. Wingate, whose relief can only be expected a fortnight before I leave, and in view of the early arrival of my successor, I hesitate to express views which might possibly be at variance with those of Colonel Trevor. I would only say that 1 think perhaps that Mr. Wingate has not in his report allowed sufficiently for a world-wide de pression of trade through which we are passing at the moment, and it is con | ceivable that for this reason his report is unduly pessimistic.

Knox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to Major Rae’s letter No. 101, dated -the 20th January 1923, I have the honour to forward a further report on the finances of the Muscat btate giving the actuals of the first six months of the year together with a revised estimate of the income and expenditure during the year. ^ These figures were prepared under my instructions by the Financial Adviser, with special reference to the alarming state of the date market and the increas ing commercial decay of Muscat. As has been previously pointed out the last six months of the year ; reduce usually a considerably larger revenue than the first six months. I he season is a more favourable one from the trading point of view, and the export which gives the zakat or five per cent, octro, takes place dunng ^ Penod^ Th^ar at the beginning of the date season the price of Muscat dates on the Bomb \ market was less than one half what it was last year, which was bv no means a good one It has since risen to about two-thirds, and is not expected to r PP rbly hkhe The system adopted therefore in calculating the revenue for he last ax months of the' yehr iJ been to take ^ ri to that during the first six months of the year and to add to it a da^ &gt; _ revenue calculated on the basis of halt, last year s revenue nu The original estimates proposed a revenue of Rs. 10 ^ t “^imateT no ture of Rs. 11,01,900 showing a deficit of Ks. 2/,o00. R h sub iects provision was made for the liquidation of the zakat cla ™ s “‘A’‘ esti- These amount to Rs. 47,250, and their payment during the year brings the esti mated deficit up to Rs. 74,750. * The revised estimates show a revenue of Rs. 9,83,350 and an expenditure of Rs. 11,06,353 giving an anticipated t ^ ^ ^ The opening balance on 1st January 19-3 va ’ ’ 1st January 1924 is estimated a\« Rs. 40,697.2 It will be seen that including the zakat claims the expenditure as originally estimated was Rs. 11,49,150 as against Rs. 11,06,353 in the revised estimates. Expenditure has therefore been reduced by Rs. 42,797, which is very creditable. Revenue has, howuver, decreased by Rs. 91,050. A perusal of the detailed figures will show that is almost entirely accounted for by the fall in customs revenue (in which is included the date octroi), especially at Muscat and Muttrah. Considering the Muscat and Muttrah figures for the years 1921, 1922 and 1923 we have— Rs. 1921 5,74,302 1922 .. .. .. • • • • • • • • 4,90.700 1923 .. .. •. • • • • * • * • 4,07,642 or a progressive decrease of approximately Rs. 83,000 per year. These figures are significant and point unquestionably to a progressive decrease in the trade of Muscat. I have repeatedly pointed out that Muscat is dying commercially at an alarm ing rate and that there is no reason why it should ever revive. 1 he conditions which gave Muscat its prosperity have disappeared never to return, and it can now only look to the actual export of Oman, that is dates, and to the actual import for Omap, that is rice and piece-goods. With falling markets the income from these will progressively decrease. It is not anticipated that a state of equilibrium can be reached before 1925. After that it is possible that there may be a very slight improvement, but it is improbable that the condition of even two years ago will again be reached. The trade stagnation in India has of course an overpowering influence on Muscat trade, as India is practically speak ing Muscat’s only market. It is therefore extremely probable that Muscat State will be bankrupt next year and unable to meet her obligations, unless rapid action is taken to provide some new source of revenue. On the expenditure side almost every possible step has been taken to reduce expenditure. The levies are essential to the existence of the state, but even in this case I have instructed the Military Adviser to fill up no vacancies in order gradually to reduce the strength to 200. The only reduction in salaries that could be made is in the payments made to the Sultan and the members of the ruling family. I consider that this could be done by paying to the* Sultan a lump sum yearly and making him responsible for its distribution in such way as he thought fit. On the other hand this would cause great discontent and it would be very difficult to get the Sultan to agree to it. On the revenue side customs are the only source of income. The raising of the rate of duty from five to ten per cent, would automatically restore the econo mic equilibrium of the State and remove all source of anxiety. ^ 1 heoretically this w'ould mean that we should have to obtain the agreement of France and the United States, but in actuality Muscat does not trade as an importer with either of these countries. It seems possible that it would only be necessary for the Sultan to announce to these Governments, after agreement with us, and through us, that he was raising the rate of import duty from five to ten per cent, from a certain date. If this was accompanied by a statement from Government that they had agreed t,o this as iar as they w r ere concerned, and that they had been approached by the Sultan to obtain on his behalf the formal agreement of the other powers w ith v, horn he is in treaty relation, it is difficult to see what difficulties they would make, especially as now they do not trade with Muscat, and have no interests or subjects in Muscat with the exception of one American missionarv. As regards the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause it may be noted that no complaint (on Id be made by a British importer as to the increased rate of duty if agreed to 1 a Government, unless he could show that a French or American importer was charged less, and owing to the absence of such persons the question would net arise. Ao apprehension need be entertained that the increased rate of duty will lumper trade. It is a light rate compared with those in force in other countries, and the only trade of Muscat is in necessities, that is food and cloth.3 J would therefore make the following definite proposals L (1) That the principle of raising the import duty from five to ten per cent. by a notification amending Article 6 of the Commercial Treaty of 1891 be definitely accepted. (2) That the Sultan of Muscat immediately on his return from- Dhufar, probably at the end of October, be acquainted with the financial situation and the proposals of Government, and that he should then initiate- the definite proposal for amendment. (3) That we should be in a position to assent to this amendment at once, so as to permit it to come into force, if possible, from the 1st Decem ber this year, leaving .the assent of France and America to be obtained later through the usual channels. If my opinion on Muscat affairs is worth anything, I cannot too strongly stress the urgent necessity for action, if we are not to be involved again in the vicious circle from which with difficulty we extricated ourselves in 1920. Finally, with great diffidence, I would venture the suggestion that the time has come for a definite reconsideration of our policy and commitments with Muscat, as this question arises directly out of the present situation in Muscat. It is assumed that the reasons for our very great interest in this state were (a) Strategic im portance, (6) Trade, (c) Protection of our subjects. It is quite clear that our interest in Muscat on these three questions has been greatly diminished, if it has not been very nearly extinguished. I will not elaborate this subject as it is clfearly beyond my province, but the putting of a definite term to our practically direct control of Muscat and its Sultan, as has been recently done in the case of Iraq, would possibly merit consideration. Even our small loan, of which about half has been repaid, is secured on the subsidies.

Agent, Muscat enclosing a letter from the ^Financial Adviser to the Muscat Government dealing with the state finances for 1921-22 and the budget for 1923. 2. It will be seen that the calendar year of the Christian era has been fixed for the financial year 1st October to 30th September which was originally started. The Political Agent considers that this will be more convenient for various reasons and I think he is probably right. 3. The Pinancial Adviser in his covering letter has reviewed last years finances in detail and explained the increases and decreases in revenue and expenditure. He estimates a deficit of Rs. 27,500 for the current year and a closing balance of Rs. 1,36,200. The Political Agent hopes that as care has been taken not to over estimate the revenue or underestimate the expenditure, the estimated deficit for the current year will not be exceeded, and he hopes that the control exercised by the Financial Adviser will make it much less. I share this hope and trust that it may be realized. At any rate, as Major Rae says, the repayment of the instalments of the loan made by the Government ot India is amply secured. 4.

To—The Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, Subject :—Muscat State Finances. I have the honour to forward herewith a statement (Appendix I) showing the Revenue and Expenditure of the Muscat Government for the Financial Year 1st October 1921 to SOth September 1922; included therein I have also shown the estimated figures as complied by Mr. M ingate, I.C.S., Political Agent, Muscat. It will be seen from this statement that there has been a considerable decrease in Customs Receipts from Muscat and Mattrab, amounting to | Rs. 1,46,300 (this figure includes the expenditure entailed in Landing charges which was not shown separately in the budget). As my appointment as Financial Adviser was only confirmed on the 1st January, I regret, I have not been able to extract details of the items on which there has been a decrease of Revenue, however, the general fall in the prices of foodstuffs and other articles during the period under review has greatly affected the Customs receipts. The heavy fall in the receipts for the months of October, Kovember and December can only be accounted for by the poor date season | due to scanty rainfall. The steady depreciation of the Dollar must also be 1 taken into consideration. The decrease of Rs. 22,200 under Miscellaneous Revenue is compensated for by Zakat Revenue and as no estimate was shown under this head, it is presumed that Zakat was included by Mr. Wingate under the heading Miscellaneous. Turning to the increase in expenditure the sum of Rs. 15,000 under the heading H.. H. Privy Purse represents repayment to the Sultan of a like amount deducted from his allowance in the previous financial year. Against an increase of Rs. 28,100 under Administrative Charges the sum of Rs. 11,800 a decrease show n under Pensions and subsidies must be deducted as certain items under this heading have been included under Administrative Charges. The decrease therefore of Rs. 16,300 is accounted for by this item having been underestimated. Miscellaneous Expenditure which show's a deficit of Rs. 36,080 was also underestimated. It must be borne in mind however that had efficient control been exercised over this item by the Finance Minister the amount would have been considerably less. Budget for 1923. In accordance with your desire that the financial year should be changed from 1st October to 1st January I have prepared the Budget for the period 1st January 1923 to 31st December 1923, and as a guide to the estimates given I have included in the same statement (appendix 2) the actual figures for the period 1st January 1922 to 31st December 1922. I would point out that in view of the steady depreciation of the Doller I have estimated the opening balance at the rates as stated in this statement. An estimated increase of Rs. 10,600 under the head of other Customs has been made to allow for the receipts from the ports which have been established in the A1 Saad country and which should prove to be good revenue producing places. Quarantine Revenue is shown Rs. 6,000 as there was a balance of Rs. 2,000 outstanding from the British India Agents at the close of 1922. Miscellaneous Revenue is decreased to Rs. 15,000 as last years figures in clude the fine paid by the A1 Saad tribe. Sohar Revenue is shown for the first time in the Budget as this port has, now been brought under the direct control of the Central Customs.On the expenditure side will be shown a large decrease under Adminis trative Charges due to the reductions effected during the last few days. Sub sidy for the Sheikhs of Sur was included with Administrative Charges last year. Customs Pay has been increased to allow for the staffing of new Custom Houses to be opened at various Ports. Miscellaneous Expenditure has been reduced as I have [been able within the past few days to make considerable reductions under this head. It will be seen that there is an estimated deficit of Ps. 27,500 for the current year leaving an estimated balance of Rs. 1,36,200 on 31st December 1923. No provision has been made by me in this Budget for the repayment of the large amount due to British subjects. Without being unduly optimistic I consider that now that the appointment of a Einancial Adviser to the Muscat Government has been sanctioned there is no reason why the State Account should not show a slight surplus instead of an 1 estimated deficit. Already I have been able to effect a large saving in ex penditure and during the course of the year no doubt further economies can be made. Revenue from other ports and also Miscellaneous Revenue if properly supervised should yield a much higher income.APPENDIX I.

Undoubtedly the chief of these were the increase in the value oi. silver consequent depreciation of the dollar compared to the rupee, the heavy slump in trade, and the stoppage of the penal Zakst. Takmg these things into consideration I think the State may he consr^ ed fortunate to have finished the year with a balance of 3 .

Sir, In continuation of my letter No.903 e.atied One 7th June 1921, I have the honour to forward a report on the finances of the Muscat State for the financial year 1st uctcber 1920 to the 30th September 1921 together with an estimate of revenue and expenditure for the year 1st Cctober 1921 to the 30th oeptemoer 1922. /0 ( fa4,£&lt;roJ- The revenue for lest year amounted to Rs«10,CQO/- end the expednditure to Es.10,60,250/'-. The revenue and expenditure have therefore just balanced end in fact a very small surplus has been achieved. Last year's budget estimated a revenue of Rs.14,22,000/- and expenditure of Rs.11,61,480/-. Hourly the revenue has been three and a half lakhs less than the estimate, while the expenditure has been a laxh less. The figures of revenue and expenditure for the year 1919-1920 were Rs. 11,39,580/- and Rs.8,13,770/-. H-p-p revenue This has been due to several causes. (1) The fall in the price of silver, and the consequent decrease in the rupee value of the dollar. During the financial year 1919-1920 the value of tVtPthe dollar was Iis.226 % 9 during last financial year the dollar sverged Rs.192 /o, or 15 per cent lower. ^s trade is in dollars or the rupee equivalent, a fall in the value of the dollar means a decrease in purchasing power, and so a decrease in trade and revenue, which in Luscat depends entirely on trade. (2) . The fall in prices. Taking the chief article of import, rice, the price of Karachi helium, the most common variety, avenged Rs.26/- during 1919-20, end Rs.2l/- last year. The customs receipts have been correspondingly affected. (3) 'The penal Xsket of 1920. This zakat of 25 $ brought nearly one lakh of rupees to the State during 1919-1920. It was not operative during last financial year. (4) The world wide trade depression. 'This affected Luscat as it affected other countries. ikerehants were afraid to make purchases sue held up their stocks. In Muscat trade almost ceased in February end karch. (5) The delay in taking over the customs at Qwadur anc Sohsr. Gwadur was only taken over half way through the financial year, and Sohar has still to he taken over. Both these ports are most lucrative from the revenue point of view. (6) The absence of *bcul Balam, the Customs Birector curing the greater pert of the 2 ear * ■Phis officer's energetic administration ensurcc the maximum revenue being obtained. Taking these adverse factors into consideration it m8 y he admitted that i-usce; has achieved a successful financial year. * perusal of the detailed figures of revenue will show that the decrease in revenue is almost entirely due to the decrease in the muscat anc. muttrah ^ rt-t-/Mm C&lt;receipts, while outside ports show a substantial increase. In other words trade depression has accounted for the decrease, not inefficiency of administration. In fact had it not been for the increased efficiency of the administration affairs would have been much worse. lixpenditure during 1920-1921. Comparing the actual expenditure with the. budget esti mates, it will be seen that the former is a lakh less. The two instalments of the loan were met in the year, and some Pis.60,000/- were spent in buying necessary motor boats. hue to delay the expenditure on the levy was not as much as had been anticipated. miscellaneous charges however proved a heavy item. The other items call for no comment. it may be noted however that the economies eifecteu, and one rfduction of the 3ultan f s privy purse have been fully justified in the sequel, as it was by these steps alone that the State was able to survive the year successfully. BUDG&amp;T 1921-19. With two years actuals compiled by me personally from the State accounts, it is possible to form a possibly closer estimate of the future revenue and expenditure of the State The figures for revenue have been compiled from these actuals, while those for expenditure have been arrived at from the official lists of salaries,etc., which have been very carefully The figures revised. income will be obtained from this port i that s larger income is exp There is little to note on the revenue side, except larger income is expected from Gwadur as a full year's will be obtained from this port instead of a half year's un the expenditure side the increase under the hf ' On the expenditure side the i by Gap tain lie Gar thy. i.evenue is estimated at Rs.lC,9o, atat its /a, &gt;10,uuu/ Balance in the State treasury anc 1 its utilisation. iVith the 1919-1920 balance of Bs*3,25,80J/- and last year’s working balance of Bs*9,35G/- the State now has a balance of Es« 3,35,150/-. I have framed a supplementary estimate for Rs.70,000/- to be met out of this balance. This is composed of only two items. The repayment of Hs.2G,000/- to British subjects who incurred losses in 1914 over the zakat, and Hs.50,000/- for arms and equipment for the Muscat levies. The question of whether the Muscat Government is to pay for these does not seem yet to have been definitely decided, end. in any case the exact cost of the afticles supplied has not yet been communicat ed by the Government of India. Owing to the uncertainty as to the financial stability of the State which still prevails, it is necessary to husband, very carefully this surplus balance. I would propose however that it be utilised in a way that is advantageous to the State. I venture to suggest that the state should at once open an account with the Imperial Bank of India at Bombay for Bs.5C,0uv/ and that the subsidies paid to the Muscat Government in Muscat should be paid in the future to their account at Jornbay. If this is done the State would repay the instalments of the loan also in Bombay by cheque on the bank. At the same time they w o U ld be able to meet their obligations in India for stores etc.,in a far easier way than is possible at present and would be able to finance the Sultan when he is in Incic . as this report may he described as my swan song in Muscat I venture to emphasise a few points connected with the financ ial administration of the kuscat state. The first is that it is upon ;he success of the finances that the whole existence of the muscat State depends, fescehas been established end the State has now an efficient defence force• It can pay its way, hut due to the character istics of all Arabs and of the Muscat ^rabs in particular, the State finances need unremitting personal care, and the knowledge on the part of the State authorities tha t this care is exercised. The second is sooner or later some regulation of the excessive amount paid to the members of the ruling family will be called for. This amount is nearly one third of the revenues, and is by far the largest head of expenditure. This is, of course, a matter for the Sultan himseif, but, I venture to think, it is he that should be made responsible, and that possibly the most satisfactory and economical method would be to grant His Highness a fixed privy purse which would in clude the allowances to his family, and to leave it to him to spent upon himself or upon them as he thinks fit. The third is that expenditure will always he apparently hiA as Muscat, in contradistinction to the other States of the Gulf, is a State that actually has to rule. It has over two hundred miles of quite thickly inhabited, ooesr,, snc a powerful and often hostile hinterland. Establishments and forces are necessary on a scale which would, appear absurd in a place like Sahrain or Koweit. The following schedules are attached (1) Detailed receipts for 192G-S1.

Mr. 7/ingate has gone into the figures in detail and it is unnecessary for me to make many comments. Muscat has felt the prevailing trade depression and bad exchange acutely, and the receipts for the last quarter fell short of expenditure by Rs.12,540/-. For the whole 8 months ho?/ever, thanks chiefly to the inclusion of the Gwadur Customs, the receipts exceeded expenditure by Rs.71,350/-. This is not very satisfactory and it is to be hoped that a revival of trade will soon begin, and enable the revenue of the State to exceed Rs.80,000/- a month for the next 4 months, so that there may be a surplus for the year.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No.267, dated the 10th February 1921, I have the honour to forward a report on the finances of the Unseat state during the second four months of the financial year. During the period under report the n receipts have totalled 3s.2,81,370/- or an average of Rs.70,340/- p.m. and the expenditure Rs.2,93,910/- or an average of Rs.74,480/- p.m. Expenditure has therefore exceeded income by Rs.12,540/-. During the first eight months of the financial year therefore the income of the state has been 3s.7,20,270/ , o-nd the expenditure Rs.6,48,920/-, showings favourable balance of Rs.71,350/-. With the cash balance which the st^-te had “t the end of last financial year, the state treasury now has a cash balance of Rs.3,97,150/-. i The fall in the receipts, which was anticipated, is entirely due to the prevailing trade depression in India, the full effects of which were felt during the months of February and March. Trade during these months almost ceased. The customs receipts from Muscat and Muttrah only totalled Rs. 1 58 010/-, and actually £bb fell to Rs.2C,o5^/- m February. Due io a certain degree to the inclusion of Gwadur in the Muscat customs, which took place in April, the receipts from outsidecfcD ports continued to be satisfactory, totalling Rs.51,157/- for the four months. For the first ei^it months of the financial year the receipts from customs at outside ports total Rs.1,21,000/-, that is over a lakh more than in the corresponding period last year. It may be said without exaggeration that it has been the more efficient organisation of the customs which has alone saved the state from what might have been a difficult financial position caused by^ falling exchange, falling prices and trade depression in India. The increase in the expenditure has been entirely due to the expenses in connection with the Levy Corps and-an increased marine establishment. It is now clear that the original budget estimates of income will not be reached. A great deal depends upon the date season, but even if this be good I do not anticipate that the income will be more than twelve lahhs for the whole year. The present balance on the eight months f working of Rs.71,350/- will be swallowed up by the second instalment of the loan and by certain non-recurring expenditure on equipment for tne levy corps, the exact amount of which is not yet known. At the same time the recurring monthly expenditure has risen to about Rs.80,ooC/- p*m® It will be necessary for the state income to average over this sum monthly for the next four months if the budget for the year is to show a surplus* I have etc., 3d.

Mr. Wingate’s letter gives a clear statement of the position and it is unnecessary for me to go into details. I need only observe that, considering the difficulties introduced by the sudden fall in exchange and the slump in trade consequent upon it, the Maskat State has done very well, and that the present position of its finances reflects great credit on all concerned. No. 267, dated Maskat, the 10th February 1921. • From—R. E. L. Wingate, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Mu skat, To—The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward a detailed statement of the finances of the Maskat State during the first four months of the financial year beginning 1st October 1920 till the 31st January 1921. The rapid fall in the exchange rate of the dollar has caused the revaluation of the cash balances in the State Treasury which are held partly in rupees and partly in dollars. The dollar has now been computed at Hs. 2 instead of at R,s. 2-8 as formerly. The cash balance in the State Treasury on the 1st October 1920 was therefore Us. 3,25,800 at the new valuation instead of Rs. 3,51,600 as formerly given. The receipts, expenditure and balances during the four months under review have all been calculated at the rate of Rs. 2 to the dollar. The receipts during the four months total Rs. 4,38,900 on an average of Hs. 1,09,725 per mensem. During the same period in 1919*20 the receipts were R/S. 2,86,090 or an average of Rs. 71,522 per mensem. The receipts therefore show an average monthly increase of Rs. 38,200, and a total increase of Rs. 1,52,800 as compared to last year. When it is remembered that during this period in the last financial year the dollar was worth more than R,s. 2-8 while now it is only worth Rs. 2, the result may be regarded as fairly satisfactory. _ ( Turning to the details of receipts the most notable and satisfactory feature is the customs revenue from ports other than Maskat and Muttrah. Ibis total Rs. 69,945 as compared to nil the previous year. In addition to the advan tage of an increase in revenue these receipts are a fairly reliable indication of the increased authority of the central administration, and augur well for ’ the future as Sohar and Gwadur the two richest of the outlying ports with J t the exception of Sur have not yet been absorbed by the central customs } control, though they will be immediately customs personnel becomes available. Landing, quarantine and miscellaneous receipts total Rs 15,950 as compared to nil the previous year. Customs receipts at Maskat and Muttrah total Rs. 2,90,885 as compared to Rs. 2,39,500 the previous year, an increase of Rs. 51,385 only. This is admittedly disappointing but it is undoubtedly caused by the prevalent trade slump due to the falling exchange. Merchants are chery. of ordering out new stocks till they have disposed of their old at the artificially high puces which were prevalent only six months ago.2 The total customs receipts from all sources are therefore Rs. 3,60,830. The budget estimate was to average a lakh a month and therefore expectations have not been fulfilled. The reasons for this have, however, been explained above and are due to world-wide conditions of which it was not easy to calculate the effect when the budget was originally framed. Expenditure for the four months was Its 3,55,010 on an average of Rs. 88,750 per mensem as compared with Rs. 2,56,000 on an average of Rs. 64,000 per mensem the previous year The expenditure has, however, included the two large items of Rs 46,740 for the repayment of the loan and Rs 53,000 for the purchase of a motor cruiser and motor boat, while in the same period of last year only the usual running administrative expenditure f had to be met. Excluding the two large items above mentioned the running expenditure was almost exactly the same as in the same four months of last year, about Rs. 64,000 per mensem. This again is satisfactory as incon gruous as it may seem almost all salaries have been increased and the salary list includes the administration of the outlying ports which it did not before. The running expenditure is within the budget estimate. The four months therefore show a credit balance in the treasury of Rs. 83,890, which gives a total cash balance at the credit of the State of Rs. 4,09,700 including the balance at the end of the last financial year, the value of the dollar being taken at Rs 2. The first instalment of the loan has been met, as also the initial expen diture on the boats. The expenses of the levy corps have been provided for, and the State should be able to meet them, but in view of the prevailing trade depression the resources of the State will have to be very carefully husbanded.

This financial year is taken, as it was from fche ist Octoher 1919 that the reform of the State was taken in hand, and control over the finances was exercised by the Political Agent under the terms of the loan, A preliminary budget for the financial year 1st October 1920 to the 30th September 1921 is also forwarded. j would refer to my letters Ho.2336 dated 28/11/19, 469 dated 8/2/20, and 1163 dated 27/5/20. PMC IikYEAR_ls_t_OCTOm 1919_T^30th_S®TMOi20- THE State started the year with nothing whatever in the treasury. In fact it may have been said to have started with less than nothing as the suite's debts even after malting heavy discount for Mediate Parent amounted to Rs.6,56,165/-, towards which Government granted a loan o BS. 6 , 50,000/-, leaving Rs.6165/- to be met from the State treasury. In addition to this the Sultan aoparently appro bated the subsidy Paid-on the 1st October, which ^ should have been credited to the State treasury, . . use. The State therefore.really started the year with a debit balance of between Rs.22,000/- and rs.SI.OOO/-. At the end of the current financial year the treasury s able to show a credit balance of Rs.3,51.61 S /-. It is worthy of remark that this satisfactory result has been attains n spite of extremely adverse conditions, nrnnely the restnctio* onon the export of rice from India, the troubles at Sur and other towns af the coast which lost the State almost a lakh of income and the continued hostility of the interior which resulted in jsomething like a blockade and was a great hindrance to trade. ^ On the other hand the State in the last month was able to.make a considerable amount out of the penal zakat. The income and expenditure during the year were Rs,1165306 and Rs. 8 ,13,774/- respectively. In the preliminary budget which I submitted the figures were Rs,10,76,400/- and Rs,9,01,280/- respectively, while in the revised budget which I submitted they were Rs,8,86,400/- and Rs.8,31,530/-. It will thus be seen that the expenditure has been practically the same as that estimated in the revised budget, while the income has been Rs.90,000/- more than that estimated in the original oudget. Turning to the details of income and expenditure ax it will be seen that customs receipts from all sources total Rs. 8,88^680/- (Rs.8,13,515/-i from Muscat and Muttrah and Rs.75,165/- from other ports), as compared with an estimate of Rs. 8 , 90,000/- (RS. 7,40,000/- from Muscat and Muttrah and Rs. 1,50,000/- from other ports). The increase of income at Muscat lhas therefore compensated for the loss of income caused by the * troubles at Sur and elsewhere* The subsidies as explained above show Rs.15,530/- les - than was expected* ♦ . ' Quarantine receipts and landing charges total Rs.6830/-. Miscellaneous receipts total Rs.99,046/-. Thi. sum includes the sale proceeds of the Nur-al-Bahr ana o. certain surplus state stores, farms of state gardens, fines etc. Expenditure under the head Sultan's privy purse amounts to Rs.1,20,000/- as estimated in the original budget. the months May to August H.H’s privy purse had been reduce to Rs.5000/- p.m. owing to the condition of the State fin ®? C ® at that time.

Under these circumstances the full payment has been made* ^ Allowances to members of the **4- V; family and adminis trative charges need no comment. The various changes which ha ve occured have been fully explained in my letter No.1388 of the 23rd June 1920. The Masnaah, Hazm and Rostaq affairs cost the State Re.52790/-. Miscellaneous expenses were Rs. 1,08,129/-.

The estimated receipts from customs and the zaKat hav, been increased by over three lakhs bo Rs. 12,00,000/-. The possibility of the removal of the embargo on the export of ri ce from India, the certain boom in trade which will be caused by the peace with the interior, and the probability of a more efficient customs control which will probably include the port of Gwadur do not make this estimate excessive On the expenditure side the first charge on the revenues is the repayment of two instalments amounting U Rs.93,480/- of the loan granted by Government. in items (3) |4) and (7) anple allowance has been made for possible increases# V. 78,000/- has been provld*. under the heading r^rin, charges.

The financial outlook may therefore now be faced with, a certain amount of confidence.

In this letter 1 stated that it appeared from the letters intsrehajrged between my predecessors mrt H.H.the uilton on the subject of the loan that on let Decanter J.820 a sun of hs.55.2St/- comprising he.38,000/- interest and he. 16,250/- first instalment of principal would be due from the Muscat State to the Government of 2. I have now mt.de out a table of payments of which I attach a copy due from the Muscat State in liquidation of the loan of fce.6* lakhs. It will be seen from this table that a v*ry heavy burden is placed upon the State during the first few years, years in which the State will be strug/ling to make both etris meet aM to provide large sums of money for essential Initial expenditure in addition to meeting the oralnury recurring expenses of administration. In my letter Do.2336 dated 28th November 1818 I had based my calculations for the repayment of the loan on Appendix H of Volume II of the Civil account Code. In accordance with, this equal instal ments of hs.43.680.4 are due every half year. 3. It will be seen that if the Government of India sanction this method of repayment, the first Instalment not being ^yatol. till after a year in accordance with the terms of the loan instead of after six months, the 3iute will only have to pay hs. 1 . 31 . 871.2 up to and including the ixxi payment due on let December 1921. instead of ns. 1.56.8* urher the present conditions. This saving of a quarter of a lakh in this most critical financial year is a matter of greatgreat laporteace to tills atrugflliag ataxe.

At Sur the merchants have effectively totin-d - ■ ' * custo-i- authorities Mod not a penny has teen recovered, over EO.COO/- Income must have been lost In the four months. I hay* suggested to K.H. that he should refuse clearance certificates to the Bur dhows when they start tre-dlng in f/ey unless the owners oay up. This will probably bring in seme of the aireare. Much the same is occurring in the Batinoh coast and the income from the ports there is negli gible. In the rough budget given in my letter number 2306 of 28th November 1919 I hud estimated hs. 1,00,000/- being ayuilrtle from 3ur. and its. 50.000/- from the other ports. Owing to the unfortunate events of the last three months I now only anticipate an income of Be. 50,000/- from sur nd the other ports during the year ending 30 th.sent. 1920. The income of the Muscat and Mattrah customs has been The income of the oct. 71500/- • &gt; o 4 64700/- Dec, 45500/- Jan. 57800/- or an average of 59 # 900/- P.m,ffp principal, preaurrmbly Be. 16/'50/-.

Taking 55,290/- ts the nount hue on the let December 1920 ty the Sultan toworhe thie debt, which is a fiiet charge on all hie revenues, it will be seen that a eum of hB- 1,2,9,870/- is left for the privy purse and Public works.

The control of expenditure hy the Director of the Customs in charge of the State Treasury is ot present rdenuete and successful, end K.K. f ’oee not end c ii ot drt v on the Customs beyond the amounts fixed. Personally I have however little doubt that he is getting Involved in doubtful transactions with Mohammed Kemoo the farmer of the Gwadar customs, which latter institution H.H.regard- M hie priv te bank, and which has been especially exempted from the control «f the Director of the Customs. These customs produce a net income of about Re.50,000/- a year, and I kI i 0 „ that H.H. has drawn barwai on Mohammed Remoo for Re. 36.000/- of which he has only actually paid Mohammed «emoo 10,000/- &amp; has asked Mohammed Remoo for Rs.1,00,000/- ior hie visit to India. These remarkable efforts we can however regard with equanimity. Hie state income and expenditure Is controlled end if anyone ie such a fool as to lend him money on the &gt; mall security of the Gwsder customs, he must be prepared not to see it again. I see no reason to suppose that H.M.G. will assist any creditor to recover a penny from H.H. in the future. Sveryone knows this, including Mohammed Remoo. Th^ moment is not propitiouc for the publication of e drastic notice stating that for the future H.M.G. will not be responsible for pressing the claims of persona lending money to H.H. the Bui tan or his family, which latter in their utter uselessness and complete penuriounese are a source of considerable embarrassment to him. 1 anticipate that it may » to do **• * *«» *“*** ^ e * K H has*no private monetary transactions except ''ith Mohanwad Rmaoo.

In letter between my predecessor and Sultan ofj Maskat there is no mention made of the sum granted, but only of an am0 ? nt to rav bis debts. The extra 1 lakh necessary for payment of debts is due to rise m rate of exchange and increase in interest owing to time, and in view of the fact that at the time loan was proposed it was impossible to G ive more than rough estimate, see my telegram dated 17th October 1364, it is clearly necessary to pav debts in full and clear matter once and for all.

This rate is slightly advantageous to the Sultan, the present exchange standing at from Rs. 252 to 254 with the certainty of rising still higher. The total amount of debts is Rs. 6,56,165. Method of payment of debts. A loan of Rs. 5,50,000 has been granted by the Government of India, repayable in 10 years with interest at 6 per cent, per annum, to the Sultan to relieve him of his debts. The security is the Customs the director of which is nominated by us, and the subsidies paid to the Sultan by Government amount ing to Rs. 1,86,400 per annum. Of this Rs 1,21,400 has been paid to Mr. Mohomed Reimoo, and the remainder Rs. 4,28,600 has been placed at the disposal of the Agency Treasury at Maskat. In cases where the creditors desire payment in India the Sultan has given the Political Agent authority to pay by supply bill on his behalf. In cases where creditors are to be paid in Maskat the money will he handed over to His Highness who will pay in the presence of a representative of the Poli tical Agent. Increase in amount of debts over the five and a half lakhs originally estimated. It will be seen that reduced as they are by a lakh of rupees from the original claims, the debts which must be paid amount to a lakh^than the loan granted by the Government of India. The reasons for this are : — (1) The fact that when the loan was originally mooted it was only possible to estimate roughly the indebtedness of the Sultan. (21 That since that time the exchan ere has risen considerably, from Rs. 212 per cent, a year ago to Rs. 250 per cent now. — The majority of the debts — ^ were in dollars. f31 That a year has elapsed since the sanction for the loan and the ' ^ settlement of the debts, and a year’s interest has in consequence to be added.

(5) That as will he shown below from the budget which I have prepared the State will well be able to undertake the repayment of a loan of lakhs at 6 per cent, in 10 years. If a loan of an extra lakh of rupees is granted, giving a total loan of 6.| lakhs, the balance of Eo. 16,165 of debts can be met from State resources. Under the original terms on which the loan was granted by the Govern ment of India, interest on the principal outstanding is payable monthly and instalments of the loan itself quarterly ; and as subsequently requested by the Sultan the first instalment will not be payable till after six months I do not know what these sums will be and I have taken as my basis of calculation for repayment Appendix N of Volume II of the Civil Account Code. According to this for a loan of 6| lakhs at 6 per cent, for 10 years the amount payable per half-year principal and interest included is Its. 13,686 or Rs. 87,372 per year. Maskat Budget for the year 1st October 1919 to 30th September 1920. This period has been chosen as the new customs officials started work on 1st October this year and from this date the old system of short payment of customs dues by the Sultan’s creditors closed. The figures have been arrived at by a comparison between last year’s figures and°the figures for the months of October and November of this year. The result on the receipt side is natural'y speculative but has been kept properly low. It is exceedingly difficult to be exact owing to the many uncertain factors in the situation at present. The three main conditions from which will result a successful financial year are— (1) An efficient customs personnel and the establishment of a moderately good customs control from Sohar to Sur. (2) The settlement of affairs in the interior which would cause a consi derable increase in trade. (3) The removal of the embargo on the export of rice from India. This is the most valuable import into Maskat and Oman and conse quently the greatest source of revenue. The buffet has, however, been based on the assumption that the full benefit of rone of these eventualities will be felt. It should, therefore, be well within, the mark. Due notice has also been taken of the fact that for about two and a half months (May to July) there are practically no imports in sailing vessels from India. Details of receipts and expenditure are given in schedules. Beceipts .—These need little comment. Included in the customs receipts is the “ Zakat ” or coastal octroi of 5 per cent, levied on goods coming into the coast towns from the interior. Subsidies. —The subsidies are a fixed amount. Expenditure .—I have allowed certain sums for public works. Some im provement in the customs buildings and general arrangements at Maskat and Muttra are imperative. Most of the official buildings are in a very bad state and an effort might be made in the direction of improving such roads as there are. A large sum f fis. 40,000) has been allowed for contingencies. With the scant material available it is impossible even to indicate what may be wanted. The Sultan’s privy purse has been fixed by himself in accordance with the proposals contained in his letters of 12th January 1919 and 26th January 1919 forwarded with my No. 28-C. of 5th March 1919 at Rs. 10,000 per men sem. I enclose copy of His Highness’s letter. The amount is reasonable.5 No provision has been made for expenditure on a Levy Corps. This question needs careful examination after we have seen the result of the first year’s working. The esiimated balance is Rs. 1,75,120 out of which Rs. 87,372 for repay ment of the loan and interest. In ordinary circumstances therefore there should be a further balance at the credit of the State. This has not be been utilised in the Budget in order to give ample margin in case of untoward events or if the customs receipts not coming up to expectation.

Firstly, in connection with finance. The Sultan has already agreed* to the appoint ment of a Customs Director selected by us but ♦Enclpsure of Serial (32). nominated and appointed by himself, if we will agree to lend him sufficient money to clear off his debts. 18. He has also now agreed to an amount being fixed for his privy purse, the remainder of - the income of the State being appropriated for the liquidation of the debt and for the payment - of interest on the loan. 19. The Customs Director would control all the places now under the present Central Customs system; but the Sultan also agreed to the control being extended to all the ports of Oman, though, for the present, it would not be possible to do much at Sur over which his control is limited. As force were available it would be possible to include this important place, the Customs revenue of which, so it is stated, would be little short of that of Muscat. 20 . Gwadur is expressly excepted by the Sultan and, from what the present Superinten dent stated, I gather that it is mortgaged to him. As it is not in Oman it need not be consi dered for the present. 21. To organise this new system a new staff would also be required, but these could be introduced gradually. 22. It may be that when the matter is gone into in detail I shall have trouble with the Sultan, but such trouble will be with the Political Agent and will not fall on the Foreign Office or the Government, 23. All I ask then is to be given the authority to introduce this scheme if I can. If the Sultan, on coming face to face with what he has agreed to, goes back on his previous conversa tions (r attempts to introduce variations which prevent the scheme being worked, I can but report the fact and the situation is as it was, but we should then, after the war, certainly have to reconsider our position vis a ins a Sultan who could only be maintained in his place at great expense and whose only value would appear to be to perpetuate a condition of chronic chaos. ( 24. I have, however, every hope of success in carrying through the above, to which he has adhered in all conversations during the past nine months. 25. If the first step is financial reorganisation, the second is some system of justice, a com modity which is absent, except in the case of Briti ,h subjects, in sufficient quantity to be of prac tical value. 26. It is natural that a man in the position of the Sultan should fluctuate considerably in what he desires and in the plans to which he wishes to give his consent. In the face of my strictures on the state of justice and law in his government His Highness agreed to the appoint ment of a Wazir or Diwan to conduct a Court of Justice and to cont ol the Walis in the districts. 27. The subject has for the moment fallen out of discussion and indeed, as will be readily understood, it is not possible to keep him to a realization of the reforms which are required unless I am in a position to strike when the iron is hot with a concrete proposal having behind it the approval of the Government and thus a practical proposition. 28. This is, however, a most urgent necessity for the State and, while the financial position is the first necessity, it is the condition of the administration which is the chief disgrace and the blot on our support of the Sultan, His Highness has not the time nor the natural applica tion to attend to the proper administration of justice even on Oriental lines, and a large part of his unpopularity is owing to his failure in this respect. He has to be kept up to it the whole time while the handing over to his brothers of the duties entailed results in a condition of affairs worse than nothing at all. 29. I have often told His Highness that, while we are willing to support him, it is useless for us to support a weak Sultan, that in return for our support we require a man who can fulfil his part of the mutual obligations involved otherwise our time, work and money are being wasted. I have explained to him that, while we wish to maintain our old friendship with his family and the alliance of mutual benefit which has existed for the last hundred years, the exertion cannot be all on our side. 30. This point of view I would propose to lay considerable stress upon with him and to show him that, in return for what we are doing for him, we must demand that he meets our requirements in administration. 31. His great fear is absorption, but I would propose to show him that he cannot expect ns to support a ruler w hose government is a standing disgrace to us and to our support of it, and that our continued backing must be dependent upon an improvement in the conditions of his rule. 32. It will be seen that, in the above, I have made no reference to the Imam or to the rebel party. My only immediate object is to remove the stigma which undoubtedly must rest uponus in the present state of affairs, but I am not of the opinion that the reforms which I suggest will make the subsequent improvement of the general situation a very much easier matter. I have not, however, neglected the determination of measures which will be required later, but they have no place in this memorandum. Let us first put right that part of Oman which the Sultan rules owing to our intervention, and the remaining part of the question will not be a difficult matter when we have time to attend to it. 33. The questions which I have raised will not wait indefinitely and it is impossible to say how long the war will continue. 34. To,sum up, it will be seen that my requirements are few. I only ask for sanction to press upon the Sultan certain reforms the assistance required from Government consisting of— (i) A loan of 5| lakhs of rupees to be paid off in 10 years. The loan to be on the security of the Customs of the State at interest of 5 per cent, per annum. (m) Assistance in finding a native of India of a suitable character to undertake the duties of Director of Customs. (m) Similar assistance in the event of the Sultan being induced to appoint a Diwan. 35 . In the event of my failure to induce the Sultan to undertake the necessary reforms the fact would be reported to Government and the question could wait until such time as His Majesty’s Government felt disposed to move in the matter.

The question of interior of Oman and of the protection of Sultan’s territory must stand over for the present. But we feel that any eventual consideration of these questions will be simplified if some sort of order is introduced into the internal administration ox Muscat. It is possible that Sultan will not agree to conditions imposed m which case offer of loan will be withdrawn. Loan should presumably be borne in equal shares by Home and Indian Governments.

From—The Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Bushire, repeated Baghdad.) Sultan who is going to Dbofar in a week asks for loan of Bs. 10,000 or for two months suspension of instalments on his present loan. Such requests must become chronic. Without knowing idea Government’s views on my recent suggestions I find it difficult to report on this demand. If nothing has yet been decided I would recommend loan being made to carry on the situa tion. Rs. 50,000 of the previous loan will remain unpaid after receipt of March 1st instalment.

Proposal that Rs. 10,000 should be provided by postponement of two months’ instalments has my support. Until we are able to deal with Maskat situation as a whole or until end of war our best and most economical course is in my opinion to give Sultan such periodical doles as Political Agent is satisfied are necessary to enable him to carry on.

M ‘ ak ‘ t ' ,,&gt; R ' id,,,t ' d ‘ t,d ™ee passed between the Political Agent, ,, _ Maskat, and myself, on the subiect of the offer by the Government of India to the Sultan of a cash advance on the value of the arms seized from the dhow “BadU”. It will be seen that His Highness does not care to accept our offer. 2 . When addressing the Government of India on 18th + September 1910, T Serial No. 2 , Part vi. 1 mentioned my apprehensions that the state of his finances being what it is, the Sultan would find the acquisition of a large quantity of arms an irresistible means of raising funds by the return of the weapons to the vendors for a consideration. Major Trevor’s present telegram confirms this surmise and clearly warrants the deduction that His Highness has already discounted the above means of obtaining ready money. It would seem in fact that in return for cash advances to relieve his pressing needs, His Highness has delivered himself into the hands of the arms dealers and promised to restore to them their consignments of arms, or their full value, as soon as he receives delivery from Government. It is no doubt these dealers, and Ali Musa in particular, who by dunning him for past advances or refusing further ones, are now pushing His Highness to importune for the release of the arms captured in his territorial waters. Incidentally the Sultan’s attitude indicates that pressed as he is financially he thinks that his ultimate con venience or welfare is likely to be less prejudiced by subjection to the arms dealers than by his being involved in debt to the British Government. 3. In the foregoing connetHon I beg to observe that while the straitened position in wdiich the Sultan now finds himself is that to which the blockade was specifically expected to reduce him, yet it was not contemplated that he would be left in that position long after the situation had arrived at maturity. The latter stage, as far as His Highness is concerned, may be said to have been reached, but it is not one at which a long halt can advisably be made. It is now a case with him of needs must where the devil drives, and I think that we may safely assume that His Highness has fallen altogether into the clutches of the arms dealers. This is a state of things which it is clearly undesirable that we should allow to endure longer than can be avoided. If we do, our other important interests in Maskat will inevitably suffer. I submit, therefore, that it has become a matter of immediate urgency to expedite the negotiations which we hope will put us in a position to effect a settlement of issues with His Highness and other entitled to be consulted. 4 To return for a moment to the question of the arms seized from the « Badil”, they are in all probability a good deal deteriorated both in condition and value by now, and in view of the Sultan’s frank explanation of his ideas for their ultimate disp &gt;sal, it seems a question for consideration whether any further necessity exists for considering the Sultan’s claims on the consign ment, or for withholding them from the scrap heap any longer. On the whole, perhaps it would be best not to irritate His Highness at the present juncture L intimating an intention to destroy them, but rather to let the ques ion of their disposal remain where it is left by his refusal of our present oiler of an advance. &gt;legram P. to the Political Agent, Maskat, No. 1105, dated the 18th November 1910.

I have acted on your telegram No. 1105 of 18th November. His Highness informs me that he does not wish to accept the advance offered him. His explanation is that ultimately he will have to return the arms or their value to the dealers and will then not be able to levy on them more than ten thousand rupees or at the most, twenty thousand. Consequently, he thinks that if he accepts a considerable advance on the arms now and spends it, he will find himself unable later to make good to the dealers the full value of them, and will, moreover, be accused by them of double dealing. His Highness is apparently much afraid of giving offence to dealers. Ali Musa in particular seems to exercise great influence over him and I think must have been financing him to a considerable extent.India Office, London, 22nd July 1904. Secret, No. 32. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. Mr Lord, In the Memorandum of Information for May 1904 regarding Loan to the Sheikh of Koioeit. external affairs &gt; forwarded with your Secret Letter of the 9th June last, No. 105, I observe that it is stated that a loan of R$. 1,00,000 has been granted to the Sheikh of Koweit to enable him to meet the payment due to his nephews under the recent arbitration award. 2. I would draw your Excellency’s attention to the fact that the matter has not been reported to me separately, and that I am not in possession of the considerations which led the Government of India t° make the loan. Hie position of the Sheikh of Koweit is such that inconvenience may arise if I am not consulted on questions of impor tance affecting his relations with the liritish Government, and it is moreover desirable on general grounds that loans to authorities or persons outside India should not be granted without my sanction. 3. I request that I may be furnished with a report on the subject. I have the honour to he. My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) St. John Brodrick.
