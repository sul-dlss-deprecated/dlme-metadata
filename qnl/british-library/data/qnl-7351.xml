A HANDBOOK OF ARABIA Volume I GENERAL Prepared on Admiralty and ADMIRALTY WAR STAFF INTELLIGENCE DIVISION (LD. 1128) MAY, 1916NOTE The sources from which this work has been compiled include native information obtained for the purpose since the outbreak of the war. This applies in particular to the strength and distribution of the Bedouin tribes and to their political relationships. Recent information from native sources has also been used for parts of the Red Sea littoral, such as the little-known region of Asir. For Central Arabia and the routes leading to it from the north new and unpublished material has been combined with that given in the notes and itineraries of less recent travellers. The first volume of the Handbook contains geographical and political information of a general character ; the second volume is devoted mainly to detailed routes. A few words of explanation on the general plan of the first volume will facilitate its use. Separate chapters are devoted to each of the great districts or provinces of Arabia, arranged on a geographical basis, beginning with those of the western littoral, and continuing along the south coast and so round to the south-eastern districts and the Persian Gulf; the last chapters of this part are concerned with Central Arabia and the Northern Deserts. In dealing with these great and varied tracts, some of them isolated from the rest by desert and steppe, the same general plan has been adopted, so far as possible, throughout. After the area of the territory under review has been defined, its physical character is described under the sub sections of Relief and Climate. Then follow social smd political surveys of the district, the former usually arranged under the sub-headings of Population, Life and Appliances, Products and Trade, Currency, and Weights and Measures, the latter describing the system of Government, Recent History, and Present Politics. The last section of such a chapter is purely geographical and is devoted to the Districts of the territory/the principal towns being reviewed in a numbered sequence after the description of the district in which6 NOTE they lie. In a composite chapter, such as that on the Gulf Coast, dealing with several independent territories, the same general arrangement, when practicable, has been followed for each area. In the population of Arabia, a distinction must be drawn between the settled constituents of society and those tribal elements which are essentially nomadic. The former are more conveniently treated after the geographical chapters describing the provinces within which their settlements fall. The Bedouin tribes, on the other hand, though they move within recognized areas and along jealously guarded ranges, are not tied to the soil, and a preliminary chapter has there fore been devoted to them. It should be noted that in this chapter | the line of demarcation of the Arabian Peninsula upon the north, as defined on p. 9, has not been strictly adhered to, since the nomad tribes of the Syrian Hamad and the Mesopotamian Jezirah are regarded by the Peninsular Bedouins as forming a great social aggregate with themselves ; moreover, some tribes move habitually from one side to the other of the border-line. Under these circum stances our survey has been extended to include the nomads of the Syrian Desert to the north of the Nefud, although geographically that area lies without the scope of the Handbook. (See of Mesopotamia and of Syria and Pale The tribes of 'Iraq, however, are not included, although some of them, especially constituents of the great Muntefiq group, range into the eastern part of the northern Nefud. They are left for consideration in a special work in connexion with Mesopotamia. It is important to remember that, owing to the war with Turkey^ the security of many of the routes has been affected, and political conditions, even in the more settled districts, are in a state of flux. Where it has been ascertained that definite changes have taken- place, these have been duly registered. But for districts where k no recent information is yet available the normal conditions of the territory are described and the date of the information is indicated. It should be added that some Arab names are left unaccented for lack of certainty about the local pronunciation. The plates at the end of each volume have been chosen to illustrate the varieties of country which are characteristic of Arabia.LIST OF MAPS 1. Arabia: Districts and Towns 2.

Key Map of Routes In pocket o In pocket NOTE ON THE SPELLING OF PROPER NAMES As a guide to the pronunciation of Arab proper names a long accent has been employed (a, i, 6, or u), to indicate the length of the vowel above which it is placed ; the Arabic consonant has been rendered by the symbol'; and the (the cutting off of the breath which can precede or follow a vowel) is represented by except at the beginning or end of a word and in some common components of place-names, such as Bir, ' welland Ras, ' head land The aim has been to assist the reader in a correct pronun ciation without overburdening the text with a large number of diacritical marks. The system of tra adopted is explained in greater detail in the Note on pp. 612 ff. Conventional spellings of names, when sanctioned by long tradition, have been retained, e. g. Bedouins, Mecca, Mocha, &amp;c.; and in some well-known names accents have been omitted, as in Asir, Hejaz, and Oman.

A rabia proper is a great square-ended peninsula, whose axis is inclined considerably east of south, between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Its mean breadth is about 700 miles, its extreme length about 1,200, and its total content rather greater than that of the Indian Peninsula. Its inhabitants call it generally ' The Isle of the Arabs', using the word which is applied as much to peninsular as to strictly insular areas. In fact, Arabia is so far cut off from the rest of continental Asia by a desert barrier, the Northern Nefud, that, in social respects, it is of insular character. For present purposes Arabia is to be understood as limited on the north by the desert of the Nefud, lying on or about latitude 30° N., or a line drawn from the head of the Gulf of Akaba to the mouth of the Shatt el-'Arab. It is unnecessary to discuss the academic question whether we ought or ought not to include also in ' Arabia ', as the ancient geographers did, the great triangle of steppe, the Hamad or Syrian Desert, which lies north of the Nefud. Physically and ethnographically there is, indeed, little distinction to be drawn between this steppe and the peninsula to the south of it; but since the social and political relations of the latter are in many respects peculiar, it is convenient to give it consideration by itself. On the other three sides—west, south, and east—the boundaries of Arabia are, of course, seas : the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Gulf of Oman prolonged by the Persian Gulf. P hysical F eatures. Relief. As a whole the peninsula resembles a broad and stout shelf sloped up sideways from east to west. The fall towards the Persian Gulf is long and gentle, the return to the Red Sea short and steep. The highest land-levels, therefore, are in the west, being survivals of an originally much higher general land-level,10 PHYSICAL SURVEY preserved either by harder composition, or by caps of erupted matter, which overlie the soft material of the mass of the peninsula. Since many summits on the upper edge of the shelf in both the north and the south of the Red Sea region—Midian and Yemen— exceed 8,000 feet, it is only to be expected that the central mass of the peninsula should lie, for the most part, at a considerable eleva tion. As a matter of fact, Nejd—as the central districts are collec tively but incorrectly called by modern geographers—has a mean elevation of fully 2,500 feet, and here and there, as in Jebel Aja in the north centre, harder masses stand up to over 5,000 feet. The only notable exceptions to the generally uniform eastward decline occur in the extreme south-east, where hard rocks in Oman have resisted denudation and break the slope with summits rising in Jebel Akhdhar as high as any in Midian or Yemen ; and in the east centre, where a long curving escarpment, facing west, defines a broad plateau uplifted about 600 feet—Jebel Toweiq. Wadis. There are no rivers in Arabia which flow perennially from source to mouth ; but there are incipient perennial streams in Asir, Yemen, the Aden district, Hasa, Oman and Nejd, and countless or river-valleys {wddis), which carry floods {seils) after rainstorms. Those which originate east of the western watershed are mostly long and shallow, their bottoms being very little depressed below the general level. The longest of these, the Rummah, whose course from the neighbourhood of Medina, through Qasim, to the Shatt el-'Arab, falls 6,000 feet in about 1,000 miles, is one good example, and the Wadi Hanifah, which runs from the westward flank of Jebel Toweiq through a gap in the ridge towards the Persian Gulf (but, perhaps, never reaches it), is another. Both these great wadis might be crossed at many points in their lower and middle courses almost without the traveller being aware of their existence. They are not, however, without importance ; for at all times they carry water beneath their beds, which can be reached by wells at varying depths; they provide lines of possible communication; and wherever, as in the Rummah in Qasim, or the Hanifah in Nejd, the ground moisture rises near or on to their surface, they create chains of oases. The wadis, on the other hand, which fall to the Red Sea have, as a whole, deeply eroded beds very steeply inclined. In their upper courses they are of little service to communications from west to east, and an obstacle to passage from north to south. In theirPHYSICAL FEATURES 11 lower courses they spread, out, and. would create oases were it not that the mass of detritus, brought down by their floods, is so soon left high and dry, to be pulverized by the sun. Good examples are the wadis of Western Yemen, which often fall some thousands of feet in less than a hundred miles. The whole Red Sea coastal region, from Midian round to the Hadhramaut, is a network of such wadis; whereas in the rest of Arabia, except in Oman, this familiar feature of desert landscape does not often obtrude itself on the traveller s attention. Deserts. The chief physical matter to note in the peninsula is desert— its different varieties and their local distribution. There are four main varieties, distinguished by their surfaces : 1. Dahanah : comparatively hard gravelly plain, covered at intervals with parallel sand-belts of varying width. (This precise distinction is not everywhere recognized, desert of nefud type being often called dkhanah and vice versa.) 2. Nefud (or Nefudh) : a continuous area of deep sand, forced by wind-pressure into high sand-billows or dunes. 3. Ahqdf: very soft dune country with comparatively narrow trough-intervals between continuous sand-billows, which are of considerable height. 4. Harrah : a surface of corrugated and fissured lavas or scoriae, overlying either plain or mountain. Of these varieties, Nos. 1, 2, and 4 are passable, if the tracts be not more than a few days' march in breadth, and sufficient water and forage can be carried from oasis to oasis. No. 3, however, must lie in very narrow belts, if it is to be crossed at all, the physical labour involved in the march being excessive, even for camels. But further qualifications must be noted : 1. Dahanah is the kind of desert most likely to hold ground-water at a depth which can be reached by well-sinkers. On the other hand, it is very barren at all seasons, and its tracts are the most extensive deserts in Arabia. Where provision of wells has not been already made, a broad dahanah may be (as in the central southern part of the peninsula) a wholly prohibitive barrier, especially if bordered and interrupted by tracts of or 2. Nefud varies in passability according to the frequency and proximity of its sand-billows ; (6) the nature of its sand, whether it be granite, sandstone, or limestone ; (c) its exposure to winter rain-12 PHYSICAL SURVEY fall If wholly or partly granitic, and situated in a zone of regular, though small, seasonal precipitation (as is the northern Nefud), it offers both a comparatively compact surface and also pasture during some months of the year. If wholly sandstone or limestone, it will be softer, dustier, and less productive, but not altogether without vegetation in spring, unless it happens to occur in a zone of very slight and uncertain precipitation, as in parts of the great southern desert area. 3. Ahqdf is rare in Arabia, the one great tract of it lying at the western end of the southern desert. Possibly it is only a local name for heavy nefud. 4. Harrah lies in patches only, and these can often be avoided altogether. If it must be crossed, it is very bad going, owing to the wear and tear to which the feet and legs of pack-animals are exposed, and to the heat reflected from its surface. But, as e. g. near Kheibar, it is often relieved by intervals or inlets of fertile detritus or exposed under-formation. Steppe. —Such are the varieties of surface which an Arab would reckon desert, i. e. country in which he will not halt more than a night or two, except perhaps during early spring. But it is necessary also to reckon with vast tracts of hard or dusty surface, plain or undulating, which, having occasional natural water-holes and permanent coarse vegetation in hollows, we should characterize as steppe. Here and on the northern Nefud the camel-breeding nomads chiefly elect to roam ; but a European force would find them almost as prohibitive as any kind of true desert, especially in late summer and early autumn. Ring of Deserts. —Deserts of one variety or another, broken on the NW. and the W. by brief intervals of steppe, make a ring of varying breadth round Nejd. On certain coasts this ring comes down to the shore-line itself, or a very short distance behind it. In the Oman district and on the Red Sea side it lies farther inland, but in the last region is replaced on the coast-line by very lean steppe. On the north, between the Hamad and Nejd, lies a belt of nefud, which does not quite fill the whole base of the peninsula and is not of the same breadth everywhere. On the Red Sea side it stops short of the Midianite Hisma and the 'Aweiridh leaving a passage through steppe, which for centuries has been taken advan tage of by the Sunni pilgrim road to Medina and Mecca, and is followed now by the Hejaz Railway. At its eastern end, on the other hand, the nefud narrows to a very thin and patchy neck NE. of Ha il, before, changing to dahanah, it sweeps round southward to continue the ring along the Gulf shore. This narrowing has per-PHYSICAL FEATURES 13 mitted a passage from the Euphratean lowlands (Nejef and Samawah) to Nejd, which, on several lines, has been utilized by the Shiah pilgrimage since the early days of Islam. On the east, dahandh, merging into steppe or nefud on its flanks, broadens from the neck just mentioned, and runs SE. in a con tinuous belt. On or about the Tropic, east of Oman, it joins the enormous block of the south desert— and in the east and ahqdf in the west—which lies all across the butt-end of the peninsula. This south desert, which at its eastern and lower end begins below the westward slopes of the Oman mountain system and touches the south-eastern shore-line itself for a considerable distance, is so broad throughout (400 to 500 miles) that it absolutely bars passage from the southern coastal districts to the centre. Arab writers call it' The Abode of Emptiness ' (Ruba' el-Khali), and the vulgar tongue terms it Er-Raml, ' The Sand' It is not certainly known ever to have been crossed, on any central line, by human foot. On the west the ring is broken by a steppe-interval of about 400 miles between the north-western corner of the great south desert and the southernmost Inarrah tracts, which occur thereafter in a series till they meet the Nefud N. of Teima. This interval is ill known ; but it is certain that, except for short distances along the lines of rare wadi-depressions which run inland north-eastward from the western watershed, it is filled with, at best, very lean steppe-tracts, averaging over 200 miles from west to east. Though not easy of passage except by nomads or well-provided parties and caravans, the avenues through this gap to the centre of the peninsula are the least difficult, on the whole, of any routes to the interior; and the gap, coinciding with a depression in the western moun tain system, explains the social importance of Mecca and Medina in all ages. Central Oases. —Within this inner ring of desert and steppe lies an elevated core of discontinuous fertility, which may be dis tinguished into three groups of more or less connected oases :— 1, Jebel Shammar, 2, Qasim, and 3, Nejd (proper). 1. Jebel Shammar, south of the northern Nefud, owes its settled population to the drainage from two lofty ranges called Aja and Jehel Selmah, which run from SW. to NE. The Nefud, however, throws out southward tongues round the butts of the ranges, virtually enveloping the hill-system. The large town of Ha'il, therefore, which, with an older town, Feid, and a score of villages, large and small, occupies the neighbourhood of the twowm 14 PHYSICAL SURVEY ranges, is a strictly oasis settlement—i.e. an urban centre in a dis trict isolated 'by desert, . ,, .-i T^Vvoi 2 Qasim, situated beyond the steppe in the south of Jebel Shammar, is divided into two main parts. The lower owes fertility to constant ground-water and occasional surface-flow in the middle course of the great Wadi Rummah (see above). As is to be expected in a wadi-basin where the level of ground water varies, Qasim is rather a string of oases lying SSW. and NNE. than a continuously fertile tract. The string is something less than a hundred miles in length. Tongues of nefud ov steppe divide its component oases, of which the two central and principal support the urban settlements of Aneizah and Boreidah, the largest and most commercial towns of Central Arabia. Besides these towns, there are some fifty settlements, large and small. Upper Qasim (Q. el-A c la) is the steppe to north of Lower Qasim. It is a pastoral tract, dependent on wells, which support some forty small settlements, . ,. 3. Nejd. This, by far the most extensive group, covers, with its steppe intervals, some 10,000 square miles, and is, geographically, not so homogeneous as the other two^ groups. It consists, princi pally of a more or less continuous chain of oases, lying either upon, or under the flanks of, the plateau of Jebel Toweiq. A series of urban settlements and large villages reaches from the (or Sudeir) district in the north to that of (generally pronounced Harlj or Hang) in the south. The present chief town, Riyadh, lies in 'Aridh, the central oasis. On this central chain depend also certain detached oasis-districts, west and south. The whole Nejd group has dahanah east and south of it, nejud and steppe on the north, and steppe on the west, the last probably interrupted, after a certain distance, by more than one fertile wadi descending from the watershed in the SW. of the peninsula. Such, for example, is the still unexplored Wadi Dawasir, which is believed to provide a chain of watering-places between Nejd and Yemen or Asir Outer Ring of Oases, &amp;C. —The other fertile tracts of the peninsula form a discontinuous outer ring on or near the sea-coasts, the zone of fertility being widest on the Red Sea side and on the south-east. On the east, this ring is at first very thin and interrupted by wide intervals. For about a third of the Gulf Coast, from Koweit as far as Qatif, both shore and hinterland are almost continuous steppe-desert. Thereafter, while a series of springs at some distance inland creates a chain of oases which forms the settled part of Hasa, there are only small spots of fertility on the shore, at rare wadi-mouths, until the ■vbbbbbbbbbPHYSICAL FEATURES 15 coast has curved some distance NE. towards the mountainous district of Ras el-Jebel. From this point, under the influence of drainage from the heights of the Pirate Coast on the north and the inland mountains of Oman on the west, as well as of its own periodic rains, there is a fertile littoral, the Batinah district of Oman. More over, inland, under the main chain of Jebel Akhdhar and its double coastal continuation towards Ras el-Hadd, and also in the Dhahirah country north of this, behind the Batinah coast, there are many rich valleys and broad oasis tracts. On the south, desert reigns unbroken along the shore-line for some distance west of Ras el-Hadd ; but as the general level of the inner land shelves upwards towards the western watershed, more fertile wadi-mouths and vegetated littoral slopes begin to appear here and there. After the mouth of the Wadi Hadhramaut is passed, the littoral becomes fertile in patches and vegetation runs inland up valleys leading towards the plateau fencing the upper Hadhramaut basin, whose main and tributary valleys, fed by drain age from the eastward and northward slopes of the southern massif of Yemen, are ribbons of green, interrupted by considerable urban settlements. From the mouth of Wadi Hadhramaut onwards, we are in the western part of the peninsula—the upper edge of the great land- shelf. A short, steep return, falling some thousands of feet towards the shore along the rest of the south coast, and along the whole of the Red Sea shore, imparts to the littoral the appearance of a mountain coast. We have before us, as we round the south western angle of the peninsula, a low coastal strip, fertile where wadis come down from the heights, but for the rest of steppe char acter, and behind it towering slopes, fertile not only in their valley- i wa® bottoms but also on their ridges, so long as we are still in the south- Sucl, western angle, which gets the fringe of the monsoon rains. Behind ilievd these again is a plateau country of great elevation (San'a lies over leu® 7,500 feet), backed by a ridge which is the main watershed. The country begins to be less uniformly fertile as its level falls away linsuli inland from this ridge, but still conserves perennial vegetation in its 0 join valleys, to a distance of about two hundred miles from the W. coast, [.east Thereafter, steppes rapidly degenerate into the utter desert of Ruba' ywidt el-Khali. This belt of fertile mountain and plateau land, together 3 far with its slope towards the Indian Ocean, was the ' Happy Arabia ' ijeseit of mediaeval geographers, and is the Yemen of to-day, with the ore# addition of the Aden-Makalla hinterland on the one hand and Asir on the other. Anything like continuous fertility, however, ends at the frontier16 PHYSICAL SURVEY of Hejaz, half-way up the Red Sea coast, at or about Lith, south west of Mecca. From this point northwards, not only do the mon soons cease to discharge, but the average altitude of the uplifted edge of the land-shelf (here of softer composition) drops some two thousand feet over a stretch of about 300 miles. Both in the littoral and inland, therefore, the isolated oasis becomes again the only support of settled life. Between Mecca and Medina, themselves oasis settlements, there are sparse patches of arable land in hollows and wadi-bottoms. A hundred miles north of the latter town, any thing like a chain of inland oases ends with Kheibar and El-'Ala. As for the coast, north of Jiddah it is worse off; for only the largest wadis bring enough ground-water down to their mouths to support settlements. In the extreme north, the volcanic system of eastern Midian raises the tilted edge of the shelf again to a great elevation ; but its rugged slopes and blistered crests preclude settle ments inland ; while the precipitous seaward fall of the secondary but lofty coastal range has not encouraged settlers. The atmospheric conditions of the peninsula, except in some of its littoral districts, are singularly favourable to human life. Intense dryness mitigates the heat by day, ensures cool nights, and, being, apparently, unsuited to much of the germ-life which preys on humanity elsewhere, inspires vigour. Given conditions under which adequate nourishment of the body can be obtained, as in the central oases for example, or on the nefuds and steppes in spring, human natality is high and the average duration of life is long. Under other conditions, however, as among those Bedouins who pass the year round on the leaner steppes, exhaustion comes early in life. This appears to be felt also where—as on the Yemen plateau, which lies at an elevation of 7,000 to 8,000 ft.—the diurnal range of temperature is very great—a drawback which impairs the sanitary value of most tropical hill-stations. The outstanding feature of the Arabian climate is this dryness. ' Arabia is placed between seas . . ., but these are so narrow as hardly to break climatic continuity with the Asian and African continental masses, both of which are exceptionally rainless in these latitudes.' Yemen profits by the autumnal monsoon, when this is not diverted, as it seems to be now and then, by the near highlands of Africa ; but the steep westward face of the Yemen and Asir # massifs causes the moisture-laden current to rise rapidly and there fore discharge so fully that it retains little or no precipitation for Climate.PHYSICAL FEATURES 17 Moiil the interior of the peninsula. Oman has sufficient periodic rains; while all along the ridge of the western watershed heavy storm- uplife] precipitation occurs from time to time (e. g. at Mecca, chiefly during ometi summer). For the rest, the most favoured region is the northern elitW Nefud with Jebel Shammar. This region, thanks to the absence of theoij very high ground on the north-west, gets sprinklings of winter and emsehti spring rains off the Mediterranean, and produces a regular spring iholw herbage: it has, in fact, a rainfall somewhat below that of the 'wn.aij- Egyptian Delta. But precipitation on the rest of the central mass il 'Ala, thins rapidly to the almost negative record of Upper Egypt. The only I greater part of the South Desert probably gets no more than an hour : moui or so of drizzle once in every three or four years, icsystei The other main feature of Arabian climate is, of course, heat, o a grot The southern half of the peninsula is included in the zone of maxi- desetft mum July-August temperature. But the effect of this on man econda depends largely on the elevation of the district in which he happens to be, and the direction of its exposure. The hottest regions are the Oman coast and the littoral (Tihamah) of Yemen: but the Gulf shore in general and the Indian Ocean littoral are hardly in better case, and there is little more to be said for the climate of the Asir and ; in so» Hejaz shores. iimanft Snow usually appears on the highest crests of Jebel Shammar iol nigte once or twice in winter, and occasionally lies on the northern Nefud life wtitl (as, e. g., in February 1911) ; but it is a marvel anywhere else in the conditio® peninsula.

It is usually guessed to be from five to eight millions. The lower of these figures is probably nearest to the truth. If we allow two and a half millions of settled and nomadic folk to the whole Red Sea slope from Midian to Yemen (the last- named, with Asir, holding two-thirds of the total); one and a half to the southern districts and Gulf littoral, inclusive of Hadhramaut (Oman alone has about half a million) ; half a million to all the Central settled districts together; and one million Central nomads, we are probably over the mark. Nomadic The physical conditions of most parts of the peninsula con strain the majority of inhabitants (where any there are) to a nomadic life ; and this, owing to the virtual impossibility of in creasing the food-producing area anywhere, must be their lot permanently, unless they emigrate. Emigration, in any case, is constantly taking place, as a result of the high natality which has been attributed in Chapter I to the inhabitants of the Central steppes and oases : and it makes the peninsula a great source of disquiet to all neighbouring lands. The surplus population usually remains for some time within the peninsula, gradually accumulating and tending to form new nomadic groups, which try to establish rights to wells and pasturage already occupied. At last, the action of some tribe or tribes, or sheer want, forces them out, with all their predatory habits and defective experience of settled life, towards the borders of Egypt, Syria, or.Mesopotamia. In historic times, for example, the settlement of the NW. African littoral by Arabs is known to have been due to a forcible expulsion of surplus population from the peninsula, carried out by certain of the stronger tribes. The overflow of the Shammar into Mesopo tamia and of the Anazah tribes into the Hamad are also instances in point. As for earlier times, the Semitic invasions of Babylonia, thePOPULATION 19 Canaanite invasion of Syria, the Hyksos invasion of Egypt, and the Hebrew invasion of Palestine are also to be explained by similar antecedent events in Arabia. The distribution, grouping, character, and resources of the several tribes are the subject of a subsequent chapter (III) ; and their relation to particular localities will be stated in the special chapters on the different provinces. It would be beyond the scope of this Handbook to give a detailed description of Bedouin society ; and mere generalities about it are aDproacl of little service. It is perhaps, however, worth while to say some- thing about those features and customs of Bedouin life which most s j.j 0 | directly affect the reception and entertainment of strangers, and inoinai s ^ lou l ( i, therefore, be known before contact. Dictated by similar ul u necessities, these are more or less common to all tribesmen. For mday the rest, study of Doughty's A cannot be too strongly ilrcrcmi recommended. Pretty well everything that needs to be known to alii a ^ )0U t Bedouin life can be found there by a patient reader. Arabia is ' a land of ancient violence'. For this state of things 1 geographical conditions are largely responsible. Only in very few, rare, and narrow districts is it possible to derive from the soil, not a superfluity, entailing wealth, leisure, and consequent civilization, but anything better than hand-to-mouth existence in full sight nsulaw of starvation. Agriculture is impossible in three-quarters of the are ) to i total area, and man must live on peripatetic food pastured on such i|jjy 0 [iii thin and evanescent vegetation that a single family has to keep on , In the move in order to live. Water again, the prime condition of ca g^ j* existence, is to be found for the most part only very occasionally in which 1® deep wells, or rain-pools, and this under a subtropical sun. Scanty he Ceate sources have to be guarded with the most jealous exclusiveness, j. { The regions over which these conditions prevail usually offer few jo nllS iii or none of those natural features which serve elsewhere to protect 'UiniW or concea l 5 and in their vast extent and distribution they impinge estatf so generally on the few fertile districts, or so often encircle these, | asti | that hardly any part of Arabia is altogether unaffected by the I'lijj inevitable social features of life on steppe and desert. ^tledlii® The most obvious of these features is suspicion. Every man is treated as a potential enemy, till he shows evidence to the iificji contrary. He is kept at a distance until his person or his ^ [ s i 0 i authority can be recognized. Therefore, in approaching Bedouins, I • cert® ^ i s as prudent to go slow and give them time as in approaching f Mesop' a sentr y i* 1 a war-area. Disregard of this advice will result in , ceS i fight or flight, according to circumstances. While all Bedouins are os a . I instinctively suspicious of, and hostile to, the unknown, various y b 220 SOCIAL SURVEY conditions, singly or in combination, cause the attitude of indivi duals or groups to differ in degree. As a general rule nomads who range habitually on the fringes of alien civilized areas are more dangerous to encounter than those habitually withdrawn in the wilds. Thus, the northern and western constituents of the great Anazah group are less safe to visit than the Shammar. Other contin gent circumstances may make particular groups yet more hostile if, for example, they range near the political frontier of two alien powers, as do the eastern Sinaitic groups ; or in a difficult moun tainous country, like the Huweitat and Huteim east and north of Akaba ; or where shelter and water can be obtained in hidden rocky recesses, as among the Beni Sakhr in the southern trans-Jordan region; or in insalubrious low-lying tracts such as the Yemen Tihamah, or the southern part of Hasa, or the eastern part of the south coast, which account for the evil repute of the Zaranik {Dhardniq) , the Ahl Murrah, and the Qara tribes respectively. Certain of the inland tribes, however, have reputations as bad or worse, and in their case one must look for peculiar causes. The ill fame of some groups of the Harb, for example—of one group espe cially, the 'Auf sub-tribe of the Masruh section—is probably due to temptation long put in their way by the pilgrim routes, where these pass through a lean region debated between two powers. The repute, again, of the Qahtan, reckoned by the popular voice the most savage of Bedouin groups, may be accounted for by their seclusion and isolation along the northern fringe of the impenetrable Southern Desert. It is possible, however, that in both these instances report is worse than fact—in the one, because it is the well-known pilgrim route that has so often suffered, in the other because the northern Bedouins, who chiefly inform European minds, know very little about the group in question. It is common talk, for example, that some of the Qahtan tribes are cannibal. On investigation, this imputation is always passed southward to the next group, till it finally fades away into One word of caution, however, must be uttered about such cut- and-dried tribal reputations. They have not, in some cases, been always the same. The Huteim, for instance, who have a bad name for robbery now, used to be esteemed among the most inoffensive of nomads—almost on a par with the despised but universally toler ated Sulubba. Some one familiar with the desert talk of the moment should always be consulted before the desert itself is entered. The least suspicious and most trustworthy Bedouins are, naturally, those of the largest and best-knit tribes, especially such as form part of a federation under the central authority of one of thePOPULATION 21 greater Emirs or the Grand Sherif. These tribes are not only controlled to some extent and directed to a common policy, but also have a tradition of self-respect, which ensures the observance of the Bedouin code of hospitality. As Doughty has well said, what stands to a Bedouin for religion is that which men will think of him. Fortunately the fame of a lavish entertainer and a protector of the guest is a condition of nobility among Bedouins ; and an appeal against any action inconsistent with this will seldom be disregarded. A properly authorized stranger, whatever his creed, should have little to fear under ordinary circumstances among such tribes as the Shammar, the Ateibah, the Wuld 'Ali, or the Ruweilah. What, however, does proper authority mean to the ordinary Bedouin ? Not the exhibition of any passport or other written docu ment. Letters from the chief Emirs, the Grand Sherif , or other great sheikhs are very valuable if the traveller is passing from one of them to another ; but in ninety out of a hundred desert camps he will find no one who can read or will respect paper. The one thing needful is a rafiq, i. e. a companion derived from the tribe through whose f range one must pass, or from some tribe allied with it or authorized to share its range. If possible, he should be a man of importance whose face will be recognized instantly by the desert men—a race ® which, like other unlettered races, keeps a long memory for faces ® and a very wide knowledge of personalities. Still better if he has : been attached to the traveller by some well-known chief. The rafiq must be kept well in evidence and to the fore in case of such a sudden ^ attack as Shakespear experienced at the hands of the Ateibah in 1 Woshm, when a good deal of harm was done before his could * make himself known in the night to the raiders. In territories • controlled by a central authority, e. g. a sovereign Emir, a well- known man from the centre may suffice throughout; but even then • it is better to take a rafiq from tribe to tribe. There are one or two 3,1 denominations of Arabs who are franked by all tribes and can them selves conduct a traveller anywhere in more or less security ; but it is i' rather less than more. Such are the (Ageyl)—recognized 1* carriers—and the Sulubba (Solubba)—tinkers, medical magicians, Dal hunters—whom no one molests. But travelling with such folk entails the disadvantage that one must go where they wish to go and at their pace ; and in disturbed districts near frontiers their thefflo* aegis is not to be relied upon, terei The efficacy of the rafiq system is based on the recognition that a e, i#® particular range or dira [dirah) appertains to each tribe, and even to ich &amp; 8 fo J eac h main section of a tribe. Tribes sometimes hold their diras in one ^'' common, as the 'Ajman and Beni Khalid are said to do at present in22 SOCIAL SURVEY northern Hasa; and there are certain districts, containing but few wells, where several tribes, each having a right of watering, cross and recross each other's diras, without committing thereby acts of trespass, though not without engendering frequent friction. Such, for example, are the steppe west of Jebel Shammar and that north east of the same district towards the lower Euphrates valley. For the right of crossing a dira the traveller is expected to pay in money or kind to the chief, who often drives a very hard bargain, but should not be regarded as levying blackmail. After all, in return for the payment, he and his tribe concede protection and allow the traveller to consume some of their very scanty supply of fodder and water. All Arab society is patriarchal. Some one man can answer for each unit, and among the best Arabs for very large units. The traveller's chief danger arises where tribes are small or so broken up that not more than one or two families recognize a chief. There is, however, one recognized exception to this sanctity of diras, namely, the right of every tribe, or even section of a tribe, to raid any other according to a well-established code of warfare, unless barred by definite federation, treaty, or ancient friendship. To go out on raid {ghazwah) is the young man's chance of proving himself, and to provide him with that opportunity is virtually obligatory on all tribes, except the meanest. The greater chiefs, like their ancient cousins, the Assyrian kings, make an annual practice of the Raid. The farther afield it goes, the greater the glory in a society punctili ously sensitive to public opinion. Raiding parties may, therefore, be met very far from the ranges of their own people, and no district is quite safe from them. They may generally be recognized by their travelling light, without women, and on high-bred camels. The is powerless against them in his own dira, except possibly through some lucky friendship on his part or the repute of his tribe. But raiding parties are not very particular. They will swoop down on a caravan without asking many questions or being much disposed to respect persons. Unless the traveller's party is very decidedly stronger than the attack, it should submit at once. 'Most of its belongings will be taken, but no life. Such submission is a well- recognized part of the game, and entails no slur on the courage of any members of the party. The more the traveller can learn and retain in his mind of the genealogy of individuals and tribes, in a land where pedigrees are very widely known back to a hoar antiquity and inordinately valued., the better for his safety and the impression he will make and leave on his hosts. He should know also, as far as possible, the political grouping of tribes and recent desert history. If, like Doughty, hePOPULATION 23 travels in J otmu jpauperis, he can avail himself, more than one who takes his own tents and servants, of the protection which Arab usage enjoins a Bedouin to extend to one who has touched as suppliant any part of his tent or belongings or eaten of his food. Strictly the efficacy of the last safeguard expires on the third day, when all that was eaten on the first is supposed to have passed out of the body. It is often worth while to appeal from the men to the women, whose instincts of hospitality, independence, and freedom of action are pleasing features of Bedouin life. It is worth while to remember that no Bedouin society is wholly self-supporting. Even if it can supply itself with sheer food from its own dira, or some purely Arabian oasis—which it rarely can—it is dependent on the outer world for other necessaries, as well as for any sort of simple luxury. Clothing materials, coffee, tobacco, and, to a great extent, arms and munitions can only reach it from ports, or from the settled districts on the fringes of Arabia. Those, there fore, who control such ports or districts can always exercise an influence upon the desert men, however inaccessible, command their behaviour in the long run, and punish their hostility. From a military point of view Bedouins make very valueless auxiliaries of trained troops, except as scouts and raiders, or, if long, hot, and waterless stages have to be covered, as messengers. Settled The principal settlements will be dealt with in the special chapters on localities (see Chaps. IV ff.), followed by detailed descriptions of the tribes themselves (see Chaps. XIII ff.) The ubiquity of nomads in Arabia explains and partly excuses common ignorance about the real extent and importance of its urban and village societies. To say that all the Arabs of the peninsula are Bedouins, or that its society is either nomadic or semi-nomadic, is far from the truth. Not only do the fertile coastal districts in the south-east and south-west of the peninsula contain numerous urban and village communities, rooted to the soil and engaged in agricul ture and trade, while the goals of the Pilgrimage, Mecca and Medina, with the port of Jiddah, are considerable towns ; but, as has already been pointed out, the three groups of oases in the centre support urban settlements, several of which have over 5,000 inhabitants apiece, besides many agricultural villages, large and small. It is, however, true that all settled communities in Arabia are affected, in various degrees, by the nomad society, which is never far from them, and often surrounds them. There is much inter marriage between the settled and the unsettled folk : chiefs and24 SOCIAL SURVEY sheikhs of the latter have residences, landed property, and interests of various kinds among the former; and the necessity under which the man of town or village lies to enter, or pass his goods through, a domain of nomads and to become to some degree dependent on them, if he travels or trades abroad, leads him to cultivate rela tions. He will be found, therefore, to be seldom of type, but usually a man of his hands, hard and warlike, who might easily pass for a Bedouin in Cairo or Aleppo, and supplies fine fighting material. The most Bedouin of all the Arabian towns in social character is Ha'il: the least are the Holy Cities and the towns of the Oman littoral and the Yemen highlands ; but the inhabitants of the last are as belli cose as any Arab of the steppes. The towns of Arabia are rarely metropolitan. They are generally only overgrown villages, on which the other villages in the same oases are either not at all, or only politically, dependent. In almost no instance is an Arabian town an emporium of its neighbourhood. Usually unproductive itself, it is neither a collecting nor a dis tributing centre. What Arabia does produce for more than its own domestic consumption is, strange to say, almost all due to nomads and mountaineers ; and the inland towns have little share in it. The Qasim towns, which organize much of the transit trade in Central Arabia and are more commercially minded than other Arabian settlements, are the chief exceptions, besides the two Holy Cities of the west, which must be set apart. These are cosmopolitan resorts, living on their visitors, and enjoying a privileged position. They maintain populations very like those of protected Arab towns outside the peninsula; but it must not be supposed that they are either centres of production or metropolitan emporia. P roducts A land of this physical and social character is not likely to produce much beyond its own food supply, or even to produce all of that. As a matter of fact, it is largely dependent for one of its chief food staples, the date-fruit, on importation: and, though it was one of the earliest centres for the cultivation of coffee, it supplies itself mainly with Brazilian and East Indian berries, while exporting most of its own small, but precious, growth to foreign consumers. Gums, butter, hides, and wool are the only other inanimate articles of export worth mention. It is, however, a principal source of one commodity of much military importance, the camel, and especially the high-bred riding camel. This, not the towns, but the nomadic societies from thePRODUCTS 25 Nefud to Oman, breed. So far as West Asia and Egypt are con cerned, it would be impossible to collect sufficient camels for the transport needs of a considerable force without the co-operation of the chiefs of the greater peninsular tribes. The famous ' Arabian' horses are of less importance. The main use of those bred in the peninsula (chiefly in Nejd) is for the im provement of other breeds. In themselves, unless crossed with non-Arab or part-Arab stock, animals of the peninsular breed are of small military value either for riding or draught. But there is a considerable export of them to India, and a less export to Syria and Egypt. The fine asses bred in the Hejaz, in the Yemen, and in Nejd are worth attention from a military point of view. Only less patient of thirst than camels, they provide, where desert or steppe surfaces are moderately hard, invaluable means of transport in such a country as Arabia. The crossing of these with native mares produces a very serviceable mule which, however, is less well adapted for desert and steppe travel than the parent ass. R eligion * The land which begot Islam and has continued to be the chief resort of its votaries is, naturally, almost exclusively Moslem. Aden (at least half Hindi) and Gulf ports and islands excepted, the number of non-Moslem residents, whether Christian—mainly Consular Officials and Greeks—or Jews, is infinitesimal, and even this small body is virtually confined to the Red Sea ports. The old Jewish colonies in the district of Nejran, and inSan'a and other Yemen towns, form a very small exception to the monopoly of the Faithful. Nevertheless, Islam, if universal, is far from a unanimous creed in Arabia. If the great majority of the inhabitants are Sunni, Shiahs are also present in considerable force. The Hasa and Central Yemen, for example, are predominantly Shiah, the one being Karmathian and the other Zeidist (see later); Mecca itself, which is partly Zeidist, is tinged with heresy, and there are many nomad groups which are Shiah, ranging not only in the north-eastern regions, but here and there in the west, e. g. one sub-tribe of the Harb. The numerous Shiah rinostof' pilgrims who reach Hejaz from various quarters and even remain Jims ^ere in small numbers, and the proximity of the Shiah Holy Cities, , of ef an ^ Kerbela, contribute to keep heresy alive in the peninsula. This, though the main, is not, however, the only split. Within the n j gt Sunni aggregate the Wahabite ( Wahhdbi) tribes have long made what ^ is virtually a schism, cutting off Central Arabia, to some extent, from the non-Wahabite populations of the coastal districts. Wahabism,■ ma 26 SOCIAL SURVEY which arose in Wadi Hanifah (Nejd) about the middle of the eighteenth century, is not, however, a heresy, but an ascetic revi valist movement among Moslems who sympathize with the strict but orthodox Hanbali school of Sunnism. Its founder preached reversion to the practice of the primitive Church of the Prophet's days; suppression of pagan practices ; freedom from all contamina tion with infidels or with men (like the Ottoman Turks) already contaminated by infidel intercourse ; and a regimen which would keep man ever mindful of things spiritual. It has much, there fore, in common with Senussism, whose founder, indeed, learned something from it through his study in the school of Seyyid Ahmed el-Idrisi at Mecca in the twenties of the nineteenth century (see later, p. 33), when Wahabism, though lately defeated, was still an influence in Hejaz. It early developed militancy, and assumed a nationalist character. After great successes at the opening of the nineteenth century, when the Wahabites were holding the Holy Cities and nearly all Arabia (not Yemen) and threatening Mesopo tamia and Syria, it was reduced by Egyptian forces, acting for the Ottoman Sultan ; and though it revived in the middle of the century and still retains its hold on Central Arabia, it has lost some of its rigour and,its militancy. But experience has shown that such revivalist doctrines may be expected to blaze up from time to time in the Moslem world ; and therefore the fact that Wahabism, anti- Ottoman and nationalist by tradition, has still numerous adherents and dominates two independent states in the heart of Arabia, should never be lost to sight. Lastly, the Ibadhi sectaries of Oman, though, like the Wahabites, Sunni, are in effect schismatic. The great annual Pilgrimage {Ha from all parts of the Moslem world to Mecca and Medina has important bearing on politics, economy, and popular character in the peninsula. The two great divisions of Moslems, the Sunnis and Shiahs, follow three main land routes : 1. Prom Damascus due south to Medina. The Hejaz Railway takes most of this traffic now ; but many pilgrims still march all the way under the Emir el-Hajj. Thence to Mecca. 2. Cairo by Sinai and Midian to Yambo' and Medina or Mecca. 3. Baghdad, Nejef, or Samawah, by Ha'il to Medina or Mecca. This Pilgrimage has sometimes been diverted through Koweit to Qasim by the action of the Nejd Emirs; and it has been entirely intermitted during the past two years. A majority, however, of the total number of foreign pilgrims now arrives by sea at the port of Jiddah and proceeds to Mecca. A com-RELIGION 27 l ^ e , t paratively small proportion goes on later to Medina , either overland, or by the ' half-sea 5 route from Jiddah to Yambo'. These usually l * ki l return to Yambo'. The passage of pilgrims is the occasion of much trade, and mer- l chants swell the caravans. It also leads to trouble with the Bedouins, 1 eonta® anc [ thus to constant unrest; and it is a great cause of the spread of to ) alt epidemic disease. The Pilgrimage accounts in normal times for an annual influx raiitkik of nearly half a million persons into Hejaz. All visit Mecca, but W, let only about a third go to Medina also, the visit to the of the ' (, f Stji latter city not being strictly part of the Pilgrimage at all, and flithei involving considerable extra expense as well as some risk owing to ted, hi the insecurity of all lines of caravan communication with Mecca, and an Not all, however, arrive at once for the season of the great Pilgrim- penirpi: age (hajj). Besides the possibility of making a minor pilgrimage mg tie 1 {'omrah) at any time of the year, many pilgrims are induced to arrive m fe; at Mecca before the end of Ramadan, i. e. more than two months ictingfoit before the great feast of the Moslem year (Yaum en-Nahr = Qurban (fthecet Bairam), which marks the Hajj season ; for by remaining till itsoieoli the feast and performing 'omrah, &amp;c., they accomplish tamattu in that a (=' possession'), and enhance their merit. But owing to the cost of time to ft life at Mecca this act of supererogation is for either the very rich, lial)ism,i or the very poor who live on charity during their stay. The Hejazis have developed a regular organization for maintaining [labia,si* and increasing the supply of pilgrims, as well as for exploiting them riesoiflii on arrival. In the early months of the year their agents are busy Djtic, in all parts of the Moslem world, preaching the necessity of pilgrim- i{ the Hoi age, and offering (on commission) to arrange the journey, provide . 0!1 pol for lodging in Hejaz, and see the pilgrims through the obligatory he twop ceremonies. When the time comes, some of these agents personally , ee jjjijk conduct parties or rich individuals to Hejaz, while at the ports or places of arrival, ciceroni{mutavmifin) await unaccompanied pilgrims, or siich parties as are too large for their conductors, ejaz? These ciceroni are organized under sheikhs, represent different ns sW® Islamic countries, and wear a special dress of bright colours and o Me* a straw cap. Since they speak various languages, and many of a or M® 8 them are travelled men, they offer, with the consular and customs ia or*' agents, the main obstacle which non-Moslems in disguise, or foreign 'OughM* Moslems desirous to conceal their identity, have to face if they wish jit has to perform the Hajj. They are all prepared to place the pilgrim, according to his nationality, in lodgings belonging either to them- •i j.gsi selves or others, Mecca, in particular, containing houses and apart- P ® im ments much in excess of the needs of its permanent inhabitants.28 SOCIAL SURVEY Medina, owing to its more exclusive population and its smaller number of visitors, offers greater risks thanMecca,and its are more difficult to evade. The Hajj must be performed in the first ten days of the last month (Dhu'l-Hij ja) of the Moslem lunar year. Like all other Moslem months, this moves round the solar year, and in 1915 coincided very nearly with our November. The pilgrim, who before entering the haram, or sacred vicinity of Mecca, must have discarded the razor and his head- and foot-gear and assumed the (a primitive dress consisting of two towel-like cotton cloths fastened round the body without the aid of knots or pins), spends the first seven days in circumambulating the Ka'bah seven times {tawdf), walking and running seven times between two hills, Safa and Merwah, each side of Mecca (sa'i), praying, attending sermons, visiting various tradi tional and holy sites near the city, &amp;c. On the eighth, clad again in the ihrdm, he begins the most obligatory of all the cere monies, the true ' Pilgrimage'. It consists in the visit to 'Arafat, a hillock in a plain, on the Ta'if road, under Jebel Qora. This trip, which is by no means without danger both on the road and in camp, despite the strong escorts provided, is obligatory not only on all visitors, but also, year by year, on all able-bodied citizens of Mecca, from the Grand Sherif downwards, and in the opinion of most authorities it is the duty which, rather than any performed in Mecca itself, confers the coveted title of hajji. The total number of those who march to 'Arafat and back amounts normally to little under half a million. The enormous crowd bivouacs in and around the village of Mina (Muna) the first night, and with daybreak on the ninth day proceeds other nine miles to 'Arafat to perform the ' Stand ' on the hill, praying, ejaculating lahbeika and hearing addresses until sundown. Returning to Mina for the night, the pilgrim performs there another ' Stand' on the morning of the tenth day, throws a fixed number of selected stones at certain devil-pillars, and offers a blood-sacrifice, usually a sheep or a goat, which he is at liberty to eat or give away. Then he must make post-haste for Mecca in the midst of indescribable confusion. In the city on that afternoon he should perform and and kiss again the Holy Stone of the Ka'bah ; and then, shaved and in secular dress, get back before dark to Mina for the day of the great feast. This he may celebrate partly at Mina, where many especially those performing the Pilgrimage for the first time, stay on for the three ' Days of Drying Flesh' partlv at Mecca. 1 J After this the Pilgrimage is over and the Hajji either stays tillRELIGION 29 a caravan can be formed for his journey under escort to Medina, Wfewif) or goes down to Jiddah, carrying with him, more often than not, disease or infection engendered by the putrefaction of the sacrificial ifthek victims at Mina, by the holy but unwholesome waters of Zemzem, leiWg or by the pollution of the main Meccan conduit, through thousands »coini of pilgrims having bathed in its sources on the Day of 'Arafat. He reentei is almost certain to be quarantined on his way—on Kamaran Island idtkm: or at T5r or at some inland station—and frequently he will die nitivefe in the odour of sanctity before he reaches his home. The peninsula has been claimed in its entirety by the Porte as right- nous tat fully part of the Ottoman Empire, in virtue of the Sultan's Caliphial iglitli, elt authority, of an alleged definitive annexation by Suleiman the Magni- illtliecti ficent four centuries ago, and of the temporary Egyptian occupation of the central provinces early in the nineteenth century. Assertion on tie I of this claim by effective occupation was one of the dreams of Turkish insfita Imperialists, and has been the motive of several ventures, from the •ongesci expedition of Midhat Pasha who, having taken Hasa in 1871, was so, year I vaunted victor of 'Nejd', to that of Ahmed Feizi Pasha in 1905, iiandSk which hoisted the Ottoman flag in Qasim and Woshm, but failed is the ill to keep it flying more than a few months. In Ha'il there have been confeistl Turkish troops from time to time since that date, but without o marcli prejudice to the Emir's independence. nillioa 1 actual fact most of the peninsula is under a number of indepen- jina (If dent native rulers, and, in the smaller part excepted, a great propor- iceeds oti tion of the population owns allegiance to mediatized or protected ill prajiii native princes,some of whom are still under Ottoman influence, others Returi under British. Even before the recent revolt, jurisdiction was ' gtoii' 1 hmited (a) in Hejaz, to the two Holy Cities with their port settlements, ectedsfe® an( i ^o the line of the railway; (6) in Asir, to one or two ports and yasheei 1 inland town and district of Ibha (Ebha); (c) in Yemen, to the [enlie®* § ari ^ sone&lt; ^ towns in the south and central districts, and to those on cojfu® 1 ^ le coa8 t as f ar north as Loheia, with their immediate neighbour- ■t an j i hoods and connecting roads.

Of the30 SOCIAL SURVEY outer belts, that on the western side is British in the extreme south, and, until recently, was Ottoman in all the rest, except for an independent state in South Asir; while that on the eastern side is British in the north and south (Koweit, Bahrein, and coastal Oman), and for the rest independent, except in so far as British influence is exerted on the Pirate Coast and in El-Qatar, and the protected Sultan of Muscat can make good his pretensions to inland Oman. The political organization of each larger province will be discussed in the special section devoted to it. But it may be as well, both for comparative purposes and in order to obtain a conspectus of those political divisions, which include more than one province, to set forth at once the character and range of the chief political powers in the peninsula, distinguished as Native and Foreign, and sub divided into Independent and Mediatized. I. N ative {A.) Independent These, if every Sultan south of the great Dahanah or on the Gulf Coast, who rules little more than one town or large village with its immediate neighbourhood were to be reckoned in, would be numerous. But here it is only necessary to take account of those who exert effective and wholly independent jurisdiction over con siderable territories. These are the princes of the Central Emirates and of a part of Asir. Besides these, the paramount chiefs of the greater nomad tribes, and even the sheikhs of some sub-tribes, exercise jurisdiction wide enough to be worth consideration ; but they will be dealt with in connexion with the nomad organization in Chapter III. (1) The Central Emirates. —These are two, that of Nejd, with capital Riyadh, and that of Jebel Shammar, with capital Ha'il. The one established in the southernmost group of central oases, and the other in the northernmost, have long disputed control over an intermediate group (Qasim) ; and each has, at moments, become paramount over the other in the course of an inter mittent struggle which has lasted for more than two generations and is far from being decided yet. At this moment (1916) the Emir of Nejd controls the larger territorial area, but is hardly more powerful, in effect, than his rival. Both, as sovereign Emirates, are comparatively modern. Nejd, the elder, reckons its history back to the middle of the eighteenth century ; while the younger, Jebel Shammar, dates its independencePOLITICS 31 ! souti only from the thirties of the nineteenth century. They have grown iorai from different origins, and their social characters have remained side is essentially distinct. It is important that any one who has to reckon Oman), with members of their ruling dynasties should understand the differ- ifluenc! ing bases of their respective Emirs' power. There is hardly any part 'otectei of the peninsula, except, perhaps, the extreme south, where both man. Emirs can safely be left out of account Between them they control, iscussd more or less, almost all the peoples, settled and nomadic, of Central both ft! Arabia ; and even in certain littoral districts, e. g. Hasa and Asir, )f thos they have something to say. , to se; The Nejd Emirate is a magnified oasis Sultanate. One settlement 1 power among many has gradually established overlordship over other local nd si powers in its group of oases, in virtue not so much of physical as of spiritual force. The ascetic religious movement known from its founder's name as Wahabism, which was adopted first and foremost by Mohammed ibn Sa'ud of Dar'iyah (Deraya), and has become the creed of virtually all oasis folk in Nejd, in Qasim, and even in Jebel Sham- mar, and also, subsequently, of large groups of nomads ranging about those oases, still has for its principal champion the Emir of Riyadh, the Giil anc l supplies the moral basis of his power. The material basis of will that power is the settled population of the Nejdean oasis-group. FOltid I Any extension of it to other oasis-groups or to tribesmen is con- of thoi sequent on and conditioned by its capacity at any given moment ver (id to exert and maintain pressure on societies of a character and Emirate organization differing from- those of its home population, but not . s 0 { I unsympathetic to its spiritual basis. The Emirate of Jebel Shammar, on the other hand, grew out of the or desert power of a great nomadic society, accustomed to maintain, mizatifl ^e watered region about the Aja and Selmah ridges, a group of permanent villages and hamlets. These served for the occasional ■id wit resor t chiefs and sheikhs, for a base of supplies, and for taking alHa'il toll of Shiah pilgrims on their passage from Baghdad to Hejaz. As al oases the amenities of these settlements increased, so did their settled trolovt P 0 P u ^ a t*on, while the sojourns of the nomad chiefs and sheikhs loment! became longer and more frequent. Coming under the influence of intei Wahabism (about 1790), Jebel Shammar accepted for a while the eratio® su P rer ^ ac y of Nejd. But after the humiliation of the latter by the qifi) tlf Egyptians, the Bedouin instinct of independence roused an 'Abdah ,1 ujoj Shammar chief, 'Abdullah, of the house of Rashid, who had been put J in charge of Ha'il by Ibn Sa'ud, to detach his oasis. This he did M g radu . all y&gt; continuing to acknowledge his suzerain till about 1847 ; rhteerf since this date Jebel Shammar has stood by itself, and has ' denO b een g rea tly increased in power by a series of able rulers.32 SOCIAL SURVEY The difference between the two Emirates may be summed up in words written a few years ago :— ' The chiefs of the house of Rashid are not, as the chiefs of the house of Sa'ud in Riadh, rulers of settled communities with which they are at one, and of surrounding tribes of Bedawis, distinct from themselves : but they are chiefs, in the first instance, of a great dominant Bedawi tribe, and in the second, of the settle ments which serve that tribe for markets and rallying points.' The upshot is that the Shammar Emirate, while inferior to its rival of Nejd in wealth and settled population, and lacking its religions tie, profits by the unity between its oasis folk and the tribes of a vast surrounding region, by the patriarchal tie binding these, and by the continual invigoration of its life under the influence of the desert. The domains of the two emirs, expressed territorially (with the reservation that Arabian native princes exercise only very imper fect territorial authority) are summarily as follows. The Emir of Nejd is acknowledged by all the southern group of oases, i.e. Kharj, Hariq, Aflaj, Dawasir, 'Aridh, Woshm, and Sedeir; by the central group, i. e. Qasim ; and by the Hasa oases and coast from the edge of El-Qatar northwards to the boundary of the Sultan of Koweit. In the steppes west of the Nejd oases his authority is, however, limited by that of the Grand Sherif, and north of Qasim by that of the Emir of Ha'il; but it is paramount on the east from the borders of Koweit to those of the domains of the Trucial Chiefs and of Oman. The Emir of Jebel Shammar is supreme in the northern group of oases, i.e. those about Jebels Aja and Selmah; in the steppes north of Qasim, from the Hejaz border in the west (and including Teima) up to within a short distance of Koweit on the east; while north of Jebel Shammar his writ runs in the southern part of the Nefud till met and nullified by the power of the chiefs of the Ruweilah, the Dhafir, and the Muntefiq in the northern part. The Emir of Nejd, therefore, controls the larger territory, and together the two emirs hold all the country between the main northern and southern deserts of the peninsula. 2. The Principate of Abu 'Arish (Asir).— This principate lies between Hejaz and Yemen, in a district which has never at any time been completely subdued by the Turks. It is now independent of them except in its northern part, where the latter hold, precariously, the inland town of Ibha and the port of Qunfudah (with a small district round each of these places), and, intermittently, the roads from one to the other. / IPOLITICS 33 lediipi Not all the rest of Asir, however, is included in the principate, whose seat is at Sabia (Sabiyah) in the Abu 'Arish district of the south, near the Yemen border. The eastern part of Asir, being the J upper and lower valleys of streams flowing inland towards the , ^ t north-east till lost in the steppe-desert of Central Arabia, is autono- ^ ant 'J mous territory of tribes, of which some recognize, in a measure, the i J authority of the Grand Sherif of Mecca, others no authority but .. , their own. They are, in fact, the true Asiris who gave so much trouble to, and finally baffled, Mohammed 'All's generals in the dor toil first part of the nineteenth century. ickingi As for what remains, the Prince of Sabia either administers or thetril federates it—that is to say, all the Tihamah and 'Aqabah lands from iing tk north of Loheia (Lahiyah) in Yemen to the confines of Qunfudah— ifluence a strip of about 250 miles from north to south, by, roughly, seventy miles west to east. Its home-land is the Abu 'Arish district, whose (witli ports are Jeizan and Midi. This is a rather broad section of the jry impi Tihamah, sloping up for some forty miles to the foot of the 'Aqabah, ie Emit or scar P of the highlands, and about 80 miles long from north to i.e. Kb south. There is here a very old tradition of independence which jjg ugjji has been maintained, on the one hand, against both the Turks and the Yemenite Imam, on the other against the tribes of the inland [oweit, F mountains. er [jji Between 1830 and 1840 Abu 'Arish was ruled by a certain Sherif 1^1, 'All, who made terms with the Egyptians. During his reign, one Seyyid Ahmed el-Idrisi, a native of Fez, and head of a religious fraternity school {tarlqah), whose tenets he had been preaching at ngrof Mecca since 1799, acquired land at Sabia; he settled there and nnesnoi c ^ e&lt; ^ (1837) in the odour of sanctity. He had been the teacher of the original Senussi sheikh, who took the covenant in his at , ^ Mecca in 1823. The Idrisi family increased in wealth during the lifetime of Ahmed's son and grandson, and appears, after the renun- ' VI jjciation of Asir by the Egyptians, in 1841, to have supplanted the ' Sherifial family of Abu 'Arish. It intermarried with the Senussi 81 house, which was now settled in Cyrenaica, and, through branches V ® 1 at Zeinia, near Luxor, in Egypt, and in the Sudan at Argo (Arju), it extended its influence. But the expansion of its temporal power . [ at home to include not only all Abu 'Arish, but the Tihamah and t vti! 'Aqabah north and south and a suzerainty over several tribes tL outside those limits (e.g. in the Sa'dah District of North Yemen, P en .jand even among the Qahtan tribes) is the work of Seyyid Ahmed's gI) j great -grandson. Vro&gt; Seyyid Mohammed, the present Idrisi, who returned from a , t' ie long absence, during which he had been educated at the Azhar and aeabia i ri34 SOCIAL SURVEY by the Senussi, and had married two wives, determined to assert complete independence of all Asir. If he was not at first as success ful as he promised to be, he effectually divided the Turks in Hejaz from those in Yemen, and is sovereign in Abu 'Arish and a consider able district north and east of it. (B.) Mediatized Princes. These vary much in the degree of their mediatization. Those in the Ottoman Sphere were less independent than those in the British Sphere, the territories of the former having been permanently occupied by Ottoman troops, and to a great extent administered by Ottoman officials ; while the sovereignty of the latter is limited only by the presence of an Agent or Resident, without permanent foreign guards, and by treaty restrictions on their foreign relations and control of oversea trade. Some of the latter, however, like the former, are subsidized. We shall consider the Ottoman Sphere first and the British Sphere second. 1, Grand Sherifate of Mecca. —This principality rests on a tribal and religious basis, the reigning head of the dominant Sherifial family being, ex officio, Chief of the Prophet's tribe, the Qoreish (a very small entity of not more than 300 fighting men), and hereditary Keeper of the Holy Places. He is of great consideration throughout the Moslem world ; but the Sherifs have never claimed or been accorded personal sanctity of the Shiite Imam type. So far as the basis of their power is religious, it rests on reverence for their descent (not for innate divine qualities in their persons, or supposed esoteric knowledge), and on respect for those who are entrusted with such holy functions as are theirs by right. The Sherif's temporal authority has varied inversely with the strength of the Ottoman power ' protecting ' him. If this were weak, his was the real power throughout North-Western Arabia.. On the one hand, receiving a large subsidy from the Ottoman Government and the title of ' Highness ', he had to admit Turkish garrisons in all Hejaz towns, a Turkish governor-general in Mecca (winter) and Ta'if (summer), and Turkish sub-governors and other officials in the five other provincial centres. On the other hand, he had his own paid guard of 500 Arab regulars, partly camelry, and could, at need, collect a large force of Bedouin allies from tribes both in Hejaz and Asir. He was the chief executive officer in Mecca itself, and alone could call up any Hejazi for military service. Even before his declaration of independence the present Grand Sherif refused to exert this authority on behalf of the OttomanPOLITICS 35 '''■ armies, pleading that the Holy Cities were not attacked. He ssuctfi co u ec ted the only dues which were imposed in Mecca, natives of m ® e i 1 which were tax-free of the Ottoman Treasury. The strength of the Sherif's position was attested by the extreme caution and consideration with which the officers of the occupying Power were enjoined to treat him. He was able to levy heavy contribution even on funds properly accruing to the Ottoman administration from port-dues and remittances from the capital. Those power enough in Central Arabia to levy dues, for the benefit hcBrii 0 f Mecca, in Qasim and even in north Nejd (Sedeir) ; his authority rmaneil an( j ^ police ranged southwards far into inland Asir ; and his minite tribal following embraced not only the strictly Hejazi tribes, such ■islimi as the Hudheil, Beni Thaqif, Juhadlah, Juheinah, and Billi, but pema a ii the great Ateibah and Harb tribes, and not, as formerly, certain nrelaft sections of them. By the recent insurrection of the tribes he has er,lef n ow become prince, in name as well as in reality, of all North-West an Spk Arabia between the Red Sea and the boundaries of the Central Emirates, and from Midian to Idrisi's limit in Asir. The Sherifial family has considerable property in Egypt, as well ifialfa as in Hejaz, and commands more pecuniary resources than any other ish (at princely family in Arabia. It also maintains a more regal state and heraft lives in a more civilized and cosmopolitan environment, throng 2. Imamate of Yemen (Ottoman Sphere).—This princedom is of ed or t' great antiquity and has a long history of independence. After )faiast shaking off the Ottoman yoke in the seventeenth century, it never :e for tt again surrendered San'a till 1872. Even during Mohammed 'Ali's )r supp® occupation of part of the Red Sea littoral, from 1814 to 1840, the e enW highlands kept their freedom. Some years later the Turks appeared at Hodeidah, and the Imam, Mohammed Yahya, submitted to y with' humiliating terms. But these cost him his throne and life at f this® the hands of indignant subjects, who, in spite of the weakness of em Aral their Imams for the next quarter of a century, continued to keep ie OttoB the Turks out of both the capital and all the highlands north jiitTirf of Ta'izz. a l in W The basis of the Imam's power, unlike that of the Sherif, is the g a nd otl personal sanctity of the prince, regarded as having inherited ^herhai infallibility and esoteric knowledge by descent from the Prophet ly c ainel through Eatimah and 'Ali's stock. His line ascends to Hasan, son froffltiil of the latter pair, through 'Ali Qasim er-Rassi, who established a e 0 flicei Zeidist power in Sa'dah (north Yemen highlands) late in the tenth ar y s en r - century. Zeidism is a trimming opportunist link between Sunnism sen t Gn and Shiism, which dates, however, as far back as the third generation ie OttoB from the Prophet. Zeidists hold, with Shiahs, that a true Caliph C236 SOCIAL SURVEY must be of the Prophet's own seed, in order to possess those innate supernatural qualities which their instinct for incarnationism demands in the leader of the faithful; but they will admit that circumstances have rendered, and may render, it necessary to have Caliphs not of the seed. To these they will accord obedience, but not worship or the title Imam. Though, therefore, they do not regard the successors of the Prophet, prior to ' Ali, as Imams, they accept them as Caliphs, therein agreeing with the Sunnis. The leaven of Shiism, however, which is in their faith disposes them to take a mystic view of the sovereign as, in some degree, an incarnation of the divine. The sovereign, for his part, influenced by this belief, is disposed to live as a sacro sanct being apart from his people. The predecessor of the ruling Imam, for example, conducted all his campaigns of revolt by proxy. The prestige of the Imamate revived with the rebellion pro claimed in 1891 in the name of Yahya Hamid ed-Din, grand father (?) of the present Imam, Yahya Mohammed. From that date till 1912 the Imam was an independent rebel securely seated in the same region of northernmost Yemen in which the Rassite dynasty had begun. Yahya Mohammed, for a short time in 1905, expelled the Turks from San'a itself, and once more ruled all the highlands, except Menakhah town. Driven northwards again by Ahmed Feizi Pasha, he returned to the charge in 1910, but after besieging San'a for three months was driven off. Thereafter the Turks pressed him closely, and in 1912 (on representations made, it is said, by the Grand Sherif and the Sheikh Senussi) he agreed to an arrangement in view of the proclaimed against the Italians. He accepted a mediatized status with residence in Sheharah, a fortress two days north of 'Amran, and a subsidy, which has since been raised to £T30,000. Both Sheharah and his capital, Khamir, were, however, garrisoned by the Turks. Under the agreement he has the supreme administration of the Sheri'ah or Sacred Law, according to Zeidist practice, in all Zeidi districts of Yemen, and, subject to Ottoman approval, can appoint and remove all magistrates in the said districts, including San'a itself. His adherents were amnestied on condition of good behaviour. His degree of independence is below that of the Sherif, in that he has not the collection of taxes, keeps no guard of his own, and has hardly any pecuniary resources beyond what his ' protectors' allow him ; but on the other hand the long local tradition of indepen dence and his sacred character inspire a more bellicose people than the Hejazis with a more ebullient and fanatical attachment to him.POLITICS 37 at . . (3) Sultanate of Oman (British Sphere).—This is an old principate m . J with a chequered history. For many centuries, from the eighth , 1 onwards, it was a purely elective primacy over the Ibadhi sectaries f of Oman, who hold, with their Khawarijite teachers, that the leader- ' 6161 ship of the faithful should depend not on an accident of birth, such , as membership of the Qoreish tribe or descent from the Prophet, but , !t on personal fitness or on political expediency. The person selected ' J J by them to rule was styled Imam, and his residence was at Rostaq. He was usually derived from one of the greater tribes, first the swerei A Z d, and then the Ya'aribah, preference, but no right, being given !ora f to a son of the last Imam. It was not till 1741 that a dynasty—the same which is still in ttierii power—was initiated by Ahmed ibn Sa'id of the Azd tribe, who W had been elected Imam as a reward for his share in the expulsion illion p of Persian troops, invited by the last Ya'aribah. His second son, in, F Sa'id, succeeded, and in the course of a very long life, which lasted fromi till about 1815, saw himself supplanted in the reality of power •elysea first by his own son, then by his brother. Sultan, and then by M lta his nephews, sons of the latter. One of these, Sa'id, who had lem i been sole regent and de facto ruler since 1804, survived and edallti succeeded him, but, for reasons never satisfactorily explained, not sagaim as Imam, but as Sultan, retaining as his title of honour , but at which he had held hitherto, like all Ahmed ibn Sa'id's descendants' ceatet' Seyyids, not Imams, the Sultans of Oman have been ever since, ions mail The fact is important, because, although the Ibadhi doctrine does ) he m not absolutely require that there should be any Imam, a natural desire gainst' for one has led constantly to the election of an Imam by sectaries iidence of the interior in opposition to the Seyyid reigning on the coast; a sutei® and most recently in 1913. That no Sultan since Ahmed's son has rahandl ever secured this recognition at the hand of the inland tribes, who g have grown more fanatical under Wahabite infiuence, is due in the tionoft main to Sultan Sa'id's transference of his seat from Rostaq to in all 2? Muscat in the earlier part of the nineteenth century, to his frequent ■an app® absences abroad at Zanzibar, &amp;c., and to a certain suspicion of (]ii)|l v ' : irreligion which has fallen on all the house since it has been in close relations with non-believers. in that The result is that the recent Sultans of the Al Bu Sa'id house ,-ri, and- have often been in reality little more than Sultans of Muscat and itors ^ stretch of the coast north and south, and that anarchy, tempered of ii# y occasional tribal alliances concluded under a new ' Imam 9 ■ose peoi a S ainst tlle Sultan, has reigned in inland districts. At the present ittachi- moment (1916) an Imam, rather than the Sultan, is recognized bv the majority of the Oman tribes.38 SOCIAL SURVEY In name, however, the Sultan claims and, if strong enough with British support, exercises territorial authority over a very long coast and hinterland, beginning on the south of the pemnsula west of Rakhyut (on about long. 53° E.), and running round to Khor Kalba, just south of Fujeirah (on about lat. 25 N.), a stretch not far short of 1,000 miles. The western half of this to about 50 miles from Ras el-Hadd, is the narrowest of strips, backed by uninhabited desert, and itself at intervals desert down to the wave- line The rest, Oman Proper, broadens out between sea and desert to a maximum of about 80 miles, and tapers again as it runs up into the Ras el-Jebel promontory. Except in the latter region, halt of which is recognized territory of the Jasimi Chief of oharjan and the other Trucial Chiefs, the Sultan of Oman claims all the habitable hinterland up to the central desert. The former African possessions of the house have been detached under an allied dynasty since the recognition of Majid, the great-uncle of the present Sultan, in 1860, as independent ruler of Zanzibar. The direct relations of the Oman Sultanate with tne iintisn Government in India began in 1798. A treaty was then framed to exclude the influence of France, with which Great Britain was at war. Since that date a state of semi-dependence has gradually been forced on the dynasty by circumstances, no Sultan haying been able to con solidate and maintain his position without British help and support. In return for a considerable subsidy, a British Resident's advice is to be treated as paramount; and in 1891 the predecessor of the actual Sultan entered into a binding agreement which subjected the external relations of the dynasty to exclusive British control. French and German efforts to obtain a footing, and restrictions which we have been compelled to impose on the transit of arms and munitions through Oman ports to both the interior and the opposite shore of the Gulf, have raised constant difficulties; but our position has been maintained. The Sultan keeps a force of regulars, sufficient to hold and preserve order on the coast, but rarely adequate when operations on any scale are necessary inland. On such occasions the help of the Indian Government is usually required. But in all other attributes of sovereignty the Sultan acts for and by himself. There is no British occupying force, and there are no British officials in the administration. 4. Sultanate of Koweit (British Sphere).—The Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast, of El-Qatar, and of Bahrein are all mediatized inde pendent rulers ; but their respective ranges are so restricted that they can be treated adequately in the subsidiary sections of thePOLITICS 39 fflgim chapter on the Gulf Coast. But the Sheikh or Sultan of Koweit aspires and to some extent attains to a wider territorial control. As more than a petty town sheikhdom the Sultanate of Koweit is d to 1 quite modern. The actual ruler, indeed, is only the second either to be a si generally styled Sultan or to claim a wider area of jurisdiction than s, to it the immediate neighbourhood of the fort and townlet, which backed I an ancest or, driven by the Turks out of his small h olding at Umm ) then Qasr on the Khor 'Abdullah, built on the south side of the Grane Inlet and k early in the eighteenth century. Growth has been fostered by the unsujii increased trade of the Gulf, since piracy was suppressed and the region,k pearl-fishing industry encouraged, and by the interest taken in of Sliiji the place by all concerned in the question of the Baghdad Railway's limsali outlet on the sea. Nominally Koweit was, until less than twenty merli years ago, included in the Ottoman province of Basra, the Sheikh r an 4 as de facto ruler being accepted by the Porte as governor ; [thepra and in 1871, when Midhat Pasha occupied Hasa, the then Sheikh subscribed to this interpretation of his status. But the British the M Government of India, which had never accepted it, insisted on nifrad dealing with him directly when the Baghdad Railway question nwasati began to loom on the horizon, and has since supported his house ■ ten I® against the Turks, with whom the late Sultan formally repudiated a y e tot all relations in 1914. In 1899 the latter signed an agreement with atid* us a si rn ^ ar nature to that entered into by the Sultan of Oman, ■ and four years later he accepted a British Political Agent at his 1 ' 0 i court. In return we paid him a subsidy. He subsequently regarded pj, guljei himself as under British protection, and made important exclusive •■•A ( , fJ[ ir concessions to us. I His son, the present Sultan, claims territorial jurisdiction over the j coast from Safwan (near the head of the Khor Zobeir, of which atl , j the Khor 'Abdullah is a lower continuation) a little north of parallel ; n0 u eS 30° N., to the Bay of Musallamiyah, north of parallel 27° N.—a stretch ' ' of about 200 miles ; and over the inner country, which is entirely I eif of steppe-desert character, from the head of the Inlet up to the 1 . P, Batin, the lower course of Wadi Rummah. But these boundaries are ^ j disputed north by the Muntefiq tribe (formerly by the Turks of ' '' a Basra); south by Ibn Sa'ud and the Beni Khalid ; west by Ibn ^ er , a jj Rashid. Effectively he rules from about Umm Qasr on the Khor jj 'Abdullah to Ras ez-Zor, and inland to about a day's distance. His ijfieP 8 territory includes the large island of Bubiyan. j The Sultan maintains a small permanent force distributed in ^ , !jj posts on the coast round, and for a short distance north and south li^,, of, the Inlet. He has residences in Koweit itself and at Jahrah. estriet^ jj- g has a considerable interest in the pearl fishery and Gulf40 SOCIAL SURVEY trade, and some property in the territory of Basra. His position, as controller of a town of growing political and commercial interest, is likely to improve. II. Foreign, (A.) Otto The Ottoman Turks penetrated into the peninsula about four centuries ago, occupying, with their garrisons, first the two Holy Cities, and secondly Yemen, including Aden. At that time they did not extend their definite occupation farther , but, receiving tokens of submission from various chiefs in other parts of the peninsula, Suleiman the Magnificent claimed the whole for the Ottoman Empire before the middle of the sixteenth century. Losing Yemen about a hundred years later, the Turks continued to hold throughout the eighteenth century (with some intervals of revolt) the Hejaz and the northern Red Sea coast-lands, together with the line of the Damascus Pilgrim Road ; but even these they lost for about a decade at the beginning of the succeeding century, during which the Wahabites of Nejd forced them out of the peninsula altogether. In suppressing the Wahabites, Egyptian forces, acting on behalf of Sultan Mahmud II, advanced in 1817 from Hejaz across Central Arabia to Hasa and the Persian Gulf, as well as into Asir and the Tihamah of Yemen ; and it is on this occupation, which was main tained in its entirety for less than a quarter of a century (with con siderable interruptions), that an Ottoman claim to Nejd can alone repose. Yemen and Asir were evacuated about 1840, a little earlier than Nejd ; but were partially reoccupied soon afterwards, and Yemen, at any rate, was almost wholly reconquered by 1872. If no account be taken of such transitory occupations as those of Qasim in 1903 and 1905, the only other province of Arabia ever held by the Turks is Hasa, seized a second time by Midhat Pasha in 1871. The inland boundaries of the Ottoman sphere of influence, now reduced to a single province (Yemen) since the insurrection of Hejaz, are wholly undetermined, and indeed have varied from time to time. The only defined boundary is that between Yemen and the Aden territory. 1. Hejaz. —The Turks, who normally numbered only about 12,000 men, all told, in the province (2,000 in Mecca, the same in Medina, and smaller garrisons in Jiddah, Ta'if, Yambo', &amp;c.), held the ports and the interior oases, together with the line of the HejazPOLITICS 41 positioi Railway and. the road from Jiddah. to Mecca. Their control was inteia practically nil over the rest of the province, including the tracks leading inland from Yambo', Wejh, &amp;C., and the tracks connecting Mecca and Medina. Only by grace of the Grand Shenf (on whom pressure could be exerted through his subsidy), or of heavy blackmail, could the Turks prevail with the Bedouin tribes. Over the populace of Mecca, Medina, Jiddah, and Yambo they had Mutloi a certain moral, as well as military, hold, through their power to two 1 promote or discourage the influx of pilgrims. But, for the rest, time 4 their occupation rested on their force, on the disorganization and receii poverty of the nomadic population, and on their influence with the rtsoil Grand Sherif of Mecca. They never colonized the province, and le ktl remained aliens in it up to the time of their recent expulsion, i centa 2. Yemen.— This province the Turks occupy normally with a much ntinud larger garrison (30,000 or more). This force they have distributed itervaki in the ports of North Asir and Yemen : in the towns of the central s teetl and southern parts of the latter region, in the Imam s strongholds these4 in the northern part, and in Ibha in inland Asir ; and also in posts 12 centi along the roads connecting the Yemen towns. They do not attempt epeninsi to occupy permanently the Yemen plateau beyond about a day^s journey east of San'a, or the inland region lying north of the Imam s onbehal residences, with the exception of one small district in Their 'ossCeuti occupation of this much, however, is effective only at the cost ot j-gJl constant fighting with the highland farmers and with the nomads L uvas g| of the Tihamah, taxes being rarely collected, outside garrison towns, ir/uitk except at bayonet-point. A mk Ottoman rule is profoundly detested in Yemen, partly on account I'ftlp ftdi interference with ancient independence, partly because it is / .jn I credited with having caused the great decline of local economic prosperity which has taken place during the past half-century. At ' iw the same time more than one unprejudiced observer has testified 8 A aS t-. that, in a singularly arduous country inhabited by an intractable • jw , Pai population, the Turks have conducted their administration without undue severity, and about as efficiently as could be expected of I aliens. They are usually seen at their best far from their centre, hi an( l in a wild country which keeps them on the alert, and compels ^ them to mingle tact with force. An attempt to replace them in Yemen might prove an arduous task, in view of the difficulty (which ween 61 j ;iag already baffled the Turks themselves) in uniting the Zeidist I population of the central highlands with the Sunnite (Shafei) popu- only a ' lations of the extreme north and the extreme south. But religious and political conditions in the province are bound to be affected ^ , k by recent events in Hejaz. of the®; J42 SOCIAL SURVEY (B.) B Direct British rule is exercised only in Aden town and a very small neighbouring district, the frontier of the Treaty Chiefs being only just beyond Sheikh 'Othman. A British Protectorate extends thence northwards to the Yemen boundary and eastwards towards the Hadhramaut. This will be dealt with in Chapter VII on the Aden Protectorate. The protectorate exercised by us in Oman and Koweit (it is the same in character and degree on the Pirate Coast and the Bahrein Islands) has already been dealt with under the mediatized princes.&amp; CHAPTER III )eiiigoil idsthei THE BEDOUIN TRIBES wards 1 i the Ac T his chapter is designed to give an account of those tribal Irnan : constituents of present-day Arabian society which are essentially latefti nomadic—those, in short, to which Arabs themselves concede the under! name Bedu. The Bedouin (Bedawi type of society is the product of desert and steppe conditions, and cannot survive long under others. A tribe which has left such conditions to settle in an oasis or other permanently arable land does not necessarily cease to be a tribe, but it does cease to be a nomad or Bedouin tribe. Therefore all those tribes of which most members now inhabit continuously fertile lands or tracts of oasis character will be excluded from the following consideration—such, for example, as the tribes of Asir, Yemen and hinterland, the Aden Protectorate, Hadhramaut and the South Littoral, Oman, and the Trucial Coast (see Chapters XIV and XV). On the other hand, Bedouin constituents of Arabian society which have passed wholly or in part northwards out of the peninsula are included. Not having changed the essential conditions of their life, but still ranging deserts and steppes, they have remained Bedu. It would be unsatisfactory not to take account here of the tribes of the Syrian Hamad and the Mesopotamian Jezirah. They are regarded by the peninsular Bedouins as forming one great social block with themselves, and some, e. g. certain constituents of the great Anazah group, still pass at regular seasons southward into the peninsula, while others have their own home ranges in the peninsula itself. Moreover, many, like the Ruweilah, Dhafir, and Huweitat, move habitually from one side to the other of the border-line, and some, e.g. the Mesopotamian Shammar, though they stay to the north of it, are integral parts of larger tribal units still at home in the south. For convenience, we adopt a geographical division of Bedouin tribes into Northern, Central (Western and Eastern), and Southern. At the outset, a tree of tribal descent from the Arch-Patriarch, Abraham, will show what Arabs consider to be the true Bedouin stock. To know this pedigree is of practical value to any one who has to deal with Arab nomads, owing to the value which they themselves attach to genealogy, the social distinctions which they base upon it, and the estimation in which they hold those expert in its intricacies.NORTHERN TRIBES , 45 A. N orthern T ribes 1. The The great group of the ANAZAH numerically probably the largest group of nomad Arab tribes, occupies the triangle of the Syrian Desert, the Hamad, which has its base on the Nefud, about lat. 30°, and its apex near Aleppo, about lat. 36°. On the east bank of the Euphrates the pasture lands N. of Deir ez-Zor and 1 along the Khabur are also Anazah country ; while a smaller group | of kindred tribes is seated round Teima, between the Hejaz Railway | and the SW. borders of the Nefud. Ibn Sa'ud is said to come of the same stock (Hasanah). The Anazah belong to the people of the North, Ahl esh-Shimal. Historians give their descent from 'Anazah, son of Asad, who sprang from Rabi'ah, one of the two great branches of Nizar. The modern Anazah tribesman will always claim descent from Wa'il, who belonged to a younger branch of the Asad group, and relate j that it is his son 'Anz or 'Anaz who is the eponymous founder of | the tribe. They are not, however, united under one head, but I are divided into several large sections which maintain towards one 2 another an attitude generally friendly, though it does not exclude , marauding expeditions and private feuds among the smaller Sheikhs. The hereditary foes of the Anazah are the Shammar; indeed the history of nomad Arabia is dominated for the last 150 years by the rivalry between these two. The original seat of the Shammar seems to have been to the N. of the Wadi er-Rummah, on the pilgrim road from Basra to Medina, or even farther south towards Yemen. One of those mysterious impulses which, from the beginning of historic times, have set the inhabitants of the peninsula migrating northwards—influences which may spring from an almost imperceptible change in climatic conditions coupled with slow increase of population in a land incapable of supporting more than very small numbers—began to disturb the Anazah in the second half of the eighteenth century. They followed on the heels of the Shammar into the Syrian Desert. The Fed'an and the Hasanah pushed the Shammar before them across the Euphrates, and established themselves in the northern steppes, which are less arid, enjoying a greater rainfall, than the wastes of Central Arabia. The 'Amarat, Siba', and Wuld 'Ali seem to have come next, and, towards the end of the eighteenth century, the Ruweilah. Their herds have flourished and increased in a climate moreTHE BEDOUIN TRIBES beneficent than that which they had left. The most famous stocks of horses are found among the northern Anazah, and the greatest numbers of camels. Bedu of the purest blood and tradition, they have remained entirely beyond the control of the Ottoman Govern ment ; and except for a few palm gardens on the Lower Euphrates, a little cultivation on the Khabur, and a village near Damascus, their Sheikhs have given no pledge to established order by the acquisi tion of settled lands, nor is any part of the Syrian Desert ploughed or harvested. Their geographical position gives them command over some of the main trade-routes of Turkish Arabia. The Hamad is a bridge rather than a barrier between Syria and Meso potamia. Until 1911, the camel post from Damascus to Baghdad passed over it once a fortnight, and regularly during the winter and spring the agents of the Damascene sheep merchants cross it, paying dues to the Anazah for safe conduct, while the camel herds of the latter supply the markets both of Syria and of Egypt; indeed, it is not too much to say that the greater part of the camel trade is in their hands. Moreover, the road down the Euphrates from Aleppo to Baghdad is largely at their mercy, as well as the first half of a frequented carriage-road from Deir, the Sinjar, to Mosul. The Anazah are thus the first of the great independent tribes with whom administrators of the settled lands must come into contact, and upon their goodwill depends freedom of inter course between Syria and Mesopotamia. Last century they played a large part in Syrian politics, and have still a zest for the game. Their own dependence on the Syrian markets must always make it a matter of the first importance to them to maintain friendly terms with those who control the province commercially ; but it must be remembered that commercial control of Syria is not, and never has been, in the hands of the Turks. The western side of the Syrian Desert is occupied by the Ruweilah (Ruwalla). With their powerful confederates the Wuld 'Ali and the Muhallaf, who are in the closest relations with them, and also their allies, the Hasanah, they number about 7,000 tents. They wander over the desert from Homs and Hamah in the north, where the Hasanah have their summer pasturages and are beginning to settle down as cultivators, to Qasr el-Azraq, south of Jebel Duruz (where the Ruweilah dira touches that of their foes, the Beni Sakhr) and down the Wadi Sirhan to the oasis of Jauf el-'Amr, which the Ruweilah took from Ibn Rashid some five years ago.

Ibn Sumeir cus,! owns the village of 'Ain Dhikr at Tell el-Faras, some 12 hours from s awjiii Damascus, with the cultivation round it. A detached group round ploujl Teima, the Fuqara and the B.

I connexion with them, and fall under the authority of Ibn Rashid ndl whenever he is strong enough to exercise it. The Fuqara are Bagll a small, poor tribe, with few camels, which depends for its livelihood ie« partly on the payment it receives from the Ottoman Government 3 cru for protecting the Hejaz Railway from Dar el-Hamra to Meda'in melk Salih, and partly on a little cultivated land which it possesses in f Eg] the rocky Harrah of Kheibar. The Billi and the Huweitat, with the a their close allies the B. 'Atiyah, are their enemies. The Aida, who Eupli are the sheikhly clan of the southern Wuld 'Ali, have charge of rellas a section of the Hejaz Railway south of Meda'in Salih. Sinjai I n summer the Ruweilah draw into the Wadi Sirhan or go with depffli the Wuld 'Ali towards the fertile Matkh plain, watered by the iiusttt Barada ; but the volcanic Harrahs east of Jebel Duruz are inhabited i of it! b y tribes hostile to the Anazah, the Serdiyah, a branch of the Beni jj-jl Sakhr, and the Jebeliyah, composed of Ghiyadh, Beni Hasan, Masa'id and others, all allied with the Druzes. With these and with the pays I -D ruzes themselves the Anazah have always been at enmity. ^ ^ The paramount chief of the Ruweilah is of the house of Sha'lan ally; ! an d the sub-tribe of Mur'idh. The present representative is Nuri r i a is; esli-Sha'lan. His own sub-tribe, the Sha'lan, together with the Nuseir, who come directly under him, consists of about 1,000 tents, but over all the Ruweilah he is unquestioned autocrat, and eRuf ki s authority is recognized by the Wuld 'Ali and the Muhallaf. (j '^lif probably the most powerful of all purely nomad chiefs, and, and- s ^ rLCe capture of Jauf, has shown himself a successful rival of ' | the Shammar. His son, Nawwaf, a convinced adherent of the a •,[ pan-Arab party, is his representative at Jauf. Though more | colourless than his father, he is better educated and is considered Arab Unionist party in Damascus, among whom he is well ' known, to be the most advanced political thinker in the desert, ..He has the inherited interest in the Turkish question which those I ^ house can scarcely escape, since it touches their own future V 0 closely. Nuri himself bears a bitter grudge against the Ottoman )ll e iljl Govermnent reason of his having been invited to Damascus by48 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES Sami Pasha in 1911, and there held a prisoner for almost a year. The grievance was aggravated by the fact that he had previously offered his assistance to Sami Pasha for the subjugation of the Druzes. He dreads any extension of Turkish authority towards the desert, and strongly opposed a scheme set on foot in 1913 to carry a branch of the Hejaz Railway from Jlzah to Qasr el-Azracj, and thence down the W. Sirhan to Kaf. In 1914 he refused to collect camels for the Ottoman Government, who were in need of transport animals for the Egyptian campaign, thereby greatly enhancing their difficulties. He removed his people into their eastern pasturages, where the Turks had no hold over them, and he is said to have acted similarly a year later and, in 1916, to have joined the Sherif of Mecca. E. of the Ruweilah and the Wuld 'Ali, the Syrian Desert up to the Euphrates is held by the 'Amarat and by the two great subdivisions of the Bishr, the Fed'an and the Siba' (Sba), who claim descent from various mythical heroes of whom Wa'il was the progenitor. The Amarat country is the SE. corner of the Syrian Desert border ing on the Euphrates from Kerbela to above Hit. The tribesmen touch the N. edge of the Nefud and go down SE. into Shammar territory if pasturage is lacking elsewhere, maintaining a truce with the Sheikhs of that dira. The early spring finds them in a wide depression, the Qa'rah (Ga'rah), two days' journey W. of Hit, while m summer they come back to the Euphrates or cluster about the springs in the Hauran valley, round Mat. The Fed'an range from Aleppo to Deir on both sides of the Euphrates and up the Khabur valley almost to the Sinjar. The Siba', famous breeders of camels, are seated on the middle sections of the Palmyra road. They go up towards Homs and Hamah on the west, to Resafah on the east, and north almost to Aleppo. If pasture is lacking on the Syrian side of the desert, they seek it in the Fed'an country and in winter their Sheikhs come down, with those of the 'Amarat and the Fed'an, to Mat and the Wadi Sirhan. The 'Amarat also cross the Euphrates on occasion, and camp with the Fed'an along the Khabur. The Wuld Suleiman, who roam between Teima and the Nefud, are of Fed'an lineage and a part of Bishr, but they stand politically outside the con federacy ; for, like their allies and neighbours the Fuqara, they pay tribute to Ibn Rashid. They have not many camels, but own a few patches of palm-growing lands in the Harrah Kheibar, which are cultivated, on their behalf, by the Huteim. The paramount chief of the 'Amarat is of the house of Hadhdhal, Fahd Bey being the present sheikh. His tents number about 3,000.£ i NORTHERN TRIBES 49 He is wealthy, and owns palm gardens at Ghazazah near Kerbela, at Baghdadiyah above Hit, and elsewhere on the Euphrates. Although his wisdom and skill in tribal diplomacy are much vaunted, he is now an old man and not so active as Nuri of the Ruweilah; nor does he concern himself with external politics. He has suffered imprisonment at the hand of the Turks and cordially dislikes them, but his closest link with affairs outside the desert is his landed property on the Euphrates. He fears that if the Hindiyah escape, a part of Sir W. Willcocks's scheme of Mesopotamian irrigation, were to be put into execution, his gardens at Ghazazah might be partly submerged, and he was inclined to blame the English for their share in that project. He could only with difficulty be reassured ^tmtr on h ea d, and shown that the better distribution of the water 11 would be of hene&amp;t to himself in common with all other land- owners. A more striking personality is Hakim (Hachim) ibn Muheid, who VL wlth Haklm ll:)n Qeishish rules over the Fed'an, some 3,500 tents in m all. Ibn Muheid is possibly second only to Nuri esh-Sha'lan in the Anazah federation. He is a man of about 40, vain, money-loving, and strongly pan-Arab.

They say that Thamir, jidd of the Duleim, and his brother Jabbar, jidd of the Jubur, guided by a man of the Sulubba, occupied the wells of Muheiwir in the Wadi Hauran. They wander over the desert on either side of the Euphrates from Fellujah almost to Anah, sharing the Eastern Shamiyah, the Syrian Desert, with the 'Amarat, with whom they are in close alliance. They have cultivated ground in the Euphrates valley, and rear large flocks of sheep which supply the Damascus market. Every winter the dealers come out across the Hamad, and, staying each with his own Sheikh, purchase the season's lambs, and drive them home across the grassy steppe in the spring. The Duleim are not camel-breeders ; their supply is little more than sufficient for their own needs. The Shammar of the Jezirah are their enemies, and there is constant feud between them and the Shiah tribes of 'Iraq, such as the Beni Hasan, who pasture their sheep in the desert round Kerbela. They are noted thieves, and have always given trouble on the Euphrates high road, where they hold up every unprotected caravan. In 1910 Nazim Pasha repressed them with a stern hand, and during his brief administration at Baghdad travellers and merchants journeyed in security. 'Ali Suleiman, the paramount Sheikh of the Duleim, was on terms of friendship with Jemal Pasha, who succeeded Nazim, and he has continued to court the favour of the Ottoman Government. He owns a house and54 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES palm gardens at Rumadi, and can 5 therefore, be coerced into good behaviour. He is not a man of much intelligence, and prefers, to any active share in politics, a.quiet life and the peaceful enjoyment of the position left him by his father, Suleiman esh-Sharqi, who was a commanding figure in the 'Iraq.

The Jebellyah (or The JEBELIYAH are a loose confederation of independent tribes acknowledging no common Sheikh, but united by common interests and conditions. They are known either as the Jebeliyah or by the older name of Zobeid (Zubeid). They inhabit the volcanic districts to east and south of the Jebel Hauran and the Lejah between the Hauran hills and Damascus. They own a little cultivated land, mainly in the Ruhbah, and flocks of sheep, but few camels. They are, as a whole, poor and of bad reputation ; like all tribes on the frontier of the desert they rob and pillage their neighbours, the settled inhabitants, but they usually escape unpunished ; for the Sultan's writ fails a few miles out of Damascus, and the stony camping grounds of the Jebeliyah are difficult of approach. The Ghiyadh used to plunder the desert post when it travelled fortnightly across the desert to Baghdad. Since its cessation, in 1912, they have occupied the outlying Turkish station, the east of Dhumeir, which was abandoned by the gendarmerie. The Jebeliyah are close allies of the Druzes, of whom they stand in awe. They pasture the Druze flocks in the low-lying Safa during the winter, and in summer come up into the foot-hills of the Jebel Hauran. They are usually on bad terms with the Anazah, and steal the sheep and camels of the Wuld 'All and Hasanah whenever an opportunity offers; and they are always at feud with the Beni Sakhr, who are the foes of the Druzes. • The Masa'id are said to be the most numerous of the Jeheliyah tribes ; the Ghiyadh are next in importance. The 'Isa, though they range Jebel Duruz and are classed vulgarly as Zobeid, are of Sakhr stock and acknowledge the kinship. The tribes of Jebel Duruz and the Lejah are only a part of the Zobeid. Another large group is found east of the Tigris and is Shiah. The[S p, irillB V NORTHERN TRIBES 55 Aqeidat, Duleim, and Jubur all claim Zobeid origin.

The BENI SAKHR, usually known as Ahl esh-Shimal,' People of the Northare of the northern Arabian stock, and reckon their descent from Mudhar, either through 'Abs or through Tamim. Legend gives varied accounts of their origin, one being that the eponymous founder of the tribe was a certain Sakhr who came from the east; another that their ancestor was a child abandoned in the desert ; he was adopted by a Bedouin called Dahamsh, who gave him his daughter in marriage, and was nicknamed Toweiq (Tuweiq) on account of a small ring which he wore round his neck ; for this reason the whole tribe is sometimes known as the Tauqah. It is also occasionally named, after the foster-father of its founder, the Dahamshah. All traditions agree, however, that the Beni Sakhr spring from a common ancestor whose tomb is venerated at Bir Ba'ir. This cenotaph, built in an ancient caravan-station on the road from Damascus to Teima, which fell into disuse in the early Abbasid period, is covered with small votive offerings, and the great Sheikhs of the tribe, when they move down to summer quarters here, would not venture to enter the Wadi Ba'ir without sacrificing a camel in honour of the The sub-tribes of the Sukhur are all descendants of Toweiq, the genealogical tree being as follows : Toweiq. Ghufl. Sehim. Ghubein. Qa'ud. 'Amr. Heqeish. Hamid. Muteirat. Fa'iz. Zeben. The territory of the Beni Sakhr stretches from the Jebel Duruz in the north to the depression of Jafar, near Ma'an, in the south; it is bounded on the east by the Wadi Sirhan, and on the west by the Jordan. It is a rolling country, sparsely covered with grass.56 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES and intersected by deep valleys which are rich in vegetation. In the spring the Sukhur go down as far south as the Jebel Tubeiq, when they are on good terms with the Huweitat; but relations between the two tribes are usually somewhat strained, and more than one pitched battle has been fought in the rocky Tubeiq hills. In the summer the wells of Ba'ir give abundant water, and the deep valley is never bare of pasturage ; but the greater part of the tribe withdraws to the country round Madeba and the northern Belqa, though the gradual extension of cultivation along the line of the Hejaz Railway has restricted their pasture-grounds. Some of the Fa'iz sub-tribe hold cultivated lands round Jizah, and Fawwaz, eldest son of the paramount Sheikh Telal ibn Fa'iz, has built himself a house on the ruins of the Roman fortress of Qastal. The completion of the Hejaz Railway has undoubtedly strength ened the hold of the Ottoman Government upon the independent tribes who range along its northern sections. The Sukhur, for example, do not enjoy the full measure of their former autonomy; for though they are unassailable when they retire into the desert, retribution falls upon them when the summer droughts force them back into the pastures west of the railway, and their cornfields at Jizah, Duleilah, Netel, and elsewhere along the line enable the Turks to put a further turn on the screw. Fawwaz has become an Ottoman official, being Kaimmakam of Jizah; but he is too close to Damascus to have escaped the political movement which has its centre in the capital of Syria, and Arab Unionists speak of him as a firm adherent of the Nationalist party. He is about 35, fairly intelligent, energetic, secretive, and untrustworthy. The Sukhur are responsible for the Hejaz Railway, as they used to be responsible for the pilgrim road , they guard the line from J izah to Kerak, and receive a yearly subsidy in return for their services. Jaussen 1 reckons the united strength of the tribe at from 700 to 800 tents, including in this estimate the three principal tribal divisions, the Ajjlibein, the Cfhufl (with the two bisr sub-tribes the Zeben and the Heqeish), and the Khadhir. To thesf, however, must be added the Khurshan and the Jubur, originally constituents of the Ka'abnah, a tribe once powerful, but now almost non-existent as a tribal unit. The Khurshan, formerly known as the Hammad, under their Sheikh Hadithah, are politically inseparable from the Bern Sakhr, though a wholly different tribe-mark bears witness to their different origin. They are a warlike people, breeders of horses and camels ; their pasture-grounds are near the Jebel Hauran. Th© Jubur are sheep owners, and only half-nomadic. The Saleitah, with a total of about 100 tents, are clients of the Sukhur and live among them. The Jahawashah, though they are 1 Coutumes des Arabes au p. 400.NORTHERN TRIBES 57 Ii reckoned as a clan of theTa'iz, are not of Beni Sakhr stock. They ^bei| are a fraction of the Useidah, who, after a bloody quarrel, abandoned ilatioi the Belqa, and took refuge with the Fa'iz. They do not intermarry 1 moii with the Sukhur, though in all other respects they form part of the iMls tribe. On the other hand, the small but valiant tribe of the Ser- iedee[ diyah, an offshoot of the Sukhur, are politically independent of letrili the latter, and not infrequently at feud with them. They inhabit Belfp the eastern edge of the volcanic country to the east of the Jebel of tin Hauran, and owe their position in the desert to the reputation of of ft their late paramount Sheikh, Mit'ab el-Qanj, said to have been the elda strongest of living men. His son Ghalib, the present Sheikh, is about mselfi 30, not so noted a raider as Mit'ab, less ambitious than his father, and of mediocre intelligence. He is in close touch with Damascus, rengtl and counted by the younger Nationalist politicians as a friend and )endeB ally; but he is not sufficiently powerful to dispense with any pro- liir, foi tection which he can obtain from the Ottoman Government, and rnomj in 1911 he successfully invoked the aid of Sami Pasha against his desert hereditary foes, the Ruweilah. !e thei The Beni Sakhr are almost always at war with the Anazah con- ields al federation on their east frontier; with the Huweitat their relations eTuifc are doubtful, with a general tendency to hostility, and the same ittow applies to their north-western neighbours, the 'Adwan. The Druzes .masci to the north are their sworn enemies, and the Zobeid confederation mtrei (the Jebeliyah), who roam the slopes of the Jebel Hauran, usually i a fin throw in their lot with the Druzes against the Sukhur, though they pillig mt are on fairly good terms with the Serdiyah. The cultivators from 3onsil )li Madeba and Salt, mainly Christians, who own most of the ploughed pilgrii l an cls on the Hejaz Railway, are obliged to maintain friendly relations i yearl with the Beni Sakhr, since the Ottoman Government offers them little or no protection. They keep open house for the tribesmen, who om 1 P rofit lar g el y b y th eir hospitality, and hold them in commensurate j trifc esteem. Such families as the Ibn Jabir and the Bisharra are much bes, 4 respected, and enjoy a considerable influence in the desert.

Having been for the past year at T aur j';P eaGe with the Ruweilah, they took refuge in their country.

TheHumeidah. The dira of the HUMEIDAH lies round Dhiban. It is bounded on the south-west by Khirbat Sarfa and the Wadi Beni Hammad ; on the west by the Dead Sea ; on the north by the Zerqa valley, Mareijimah and Duleilah, and on the east by Umm Shureif, 'Ara'ir, and the Wadi Mojib. It extends, therefore, from 7 miles north of Kerak to 4 miles south of Madeba, a distance of about 28 miles, j and is about 17 miles from west to east. The tribe, which had an evil reputation for unruliness and violence, has, since the occupation of Kerak by the Ottoman Government some twenty years ago, been reduced to complete submission and almost ruined by exactions. It pays £T 3,000 in taxes. The mudir of Walah was specially appointed to take charge of the Humeidah. They number about 700 tents, and claim descent from a common ancestor called Fadhil, who came into the Dead Sea region with Sakhr, the of the Sukhur. For this reason they recognize a distant kinship between themselves and the Beni Sakhr. They are sheep-breeders, and grow crops in the fertile Kurah district.

TheHuweitdt The HUWEITAT are a stout and warlike tribe whose country extends from near Teima in the south to Kerak in the north, and on the east to the Nefud and the Wadi Sirhan. On the west it is scattered down the Gulf of Akaba and through Sinai into Egypt. Huweitat are nomads in the desert north-east of Cairo, and settled as cultivators round Tanta. The Huweitat of Akaba, Sinai, and Egypt have no political link with the Sheikhs whose head-quarters are at or near Ma'an ; but they recognize certain claims of kinship, and if a Huweiti of the Tawayah or Beni Jazi got into difficulties with the Ottoman Government, he would seek refuge, if he could escape, in Sinai or in Egypt. The Huweitat have, however, an exceptionally bad name for treachery. They are divided among themselves, and do not respect their own blood-ties. One clan will set upon a caravan under the convoy of a of another clan, shoot the rafiq, and rob and murder the merchants. On the Syrian side the leading sub-tribe is the Beni Jazi, and 'Arar ibn Jazi is nominally the paramount Sheikh ; but he is not recognized by the Abu Tayy, and the two groups are frequently at feud. The Tayy are an offshoot of the Jazi, and owe their position to the restless energy of their Sheikhs. The late chief, 'Audah, was one of the most famous raiders of his time, and did not hesitate to carry his expeditions across the Hamad to the Euphrates, where he raided Ibn Hadhdhal of the' Amarat. On one occasion, when he was out against the Siba', he pushed almost as far north as Aleppo. The Huweitat are on close terms of friendship with the Beni 'Atiyah, and are at liberty to camp through all the 'Atiyah country. The Sheikh Ahmed ibn Tuqeiqah occupies the Red Sea coast between Muweilah and Dhaba, with his head-quarters at Dhaba. They are at war with the Shammar, except the clan of the Rammal, which is connected by marriage with the Tayy ; and they are usually on bad terms with the Wuld Suleiman and the Euqara. With the Sukhur relations are always delicate, and the two tribes often break into sharp conflict. In 1914 the jealousy between Ibn Jazi and Abu Tayy led to continuous raids between the sub-tribes. Ibn Jazi took refuge with the Sukhur, and the Tayy with the Ruweilah. But the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey filled tribes with a common fear that their camels might be requisitioned by the Ottoman Government for transport purposes ; the Huweitat made up their differences, and together with the Sukhur retired east into the Anazah dira, where the Government could not reachTRIBES OF THE CENTRAL WEST 61 them. They are charged with the protection of the Hejaz Railway from Kerak to Ma'an, and receive a yearly subsidy. Since Sami Pasha's expedition into the desert in 1910 they have regarded count Ottoman authority with a certain amount of respect. 'Audah's rth, ai cousin, Mohammed abu Tayy, was imprisoned for several months est it in Damascus, and upon his release was made responsible for the d Egv payment of the sheep- and camel-tax of his tribe—a lucrative position i settl which he would be unwilling to forfeit. nai, ar In the spring the Tayy pasture over the north and east of the ■quart Jebel Tubeiq ; the Jazi camp to the south and south-west. In the kini summer the tribe draws in to Ma'an, where it owns a little cultivation, iffici and to Jafar, a depression east of Ma'an. Ma'an is the northern he coi limit of the sandstone desert. Here the grassy downs of the Beni 'ever, Sakhr country give place to forbidding leagues of rock weathered d affl into fantastic shapes and diversified by sand-hills. Wells are few ; c l an , nevertheless, in the sandstone bottoms there is a sufficiency of her c i small shrubs and succulent weeds after the scanty rain. The Huweitat are not among the great camel-owners ; probably jU z j j the whole of the Syrian branch has not more than 5,000 to 8,000 animals. , e( . uel j The Huweitat claim to be Ashraf, i. e., descendants of the Prophet )we | through his daughter Patimah; but it has been conjectured that .ig c |j they have a .history which is ethnologically of far greater interest.

Beni62 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES state that the 'Atiyah tribe was the origin of the Huweitat, the Heiwat, the Terabln, Ma'zi, and Tiyahah. Whether or no this be the true explanation of the relation between the 'Atiyah and the Huweitat, it is certain that their connexion is exceedingly close. The two tribes camp in each other's country, and aid each other against common enemies. The 'Atiyah occupy the northern half of the 'Aweiridh Harrah, and are separated from the Mawahib Harrah by the hollow plain of the Jau, through which there is a road from Wejh to Tebuk. The Jau is reckoned to be the dividing line between the Ahl esh- Shimal and the Ahl Qibli, the northern and the southern Arabs. The 'Atiyah are held responsible for the Hejaz line from Ma'an to Dar el-Hamra. The coast from Sheikh 'Antar up to the Gulf of Akaba is in their hands (or those of the Huweitat, their allies), as well as the high barren hills between the and the sea. Their rugged mountain district is unsuitable for camel-breeding. Of the sub-tribes, the Sidenyin and the Khutheirah inhabit the 'Aweiridh Jiarrah, the Sidenyin being at the northern end with the Subut to the west of them. The 'Uqeilat (Ageylat) used to be carriers of goods between Ma'an and Tebuk, but the railway must have taken some of their trade. The 'Atiyah are stout in arms. Their foes are the Shammar and the allies of Shammar, the Euqara and Wuld Suleiman. With the Fuqara the 'Atiyah maintain an inextinguishable feud.

They are sheep-breeders, and are reduced to small numbers, though they were once powerful enough to drive the Beni Sakhr from the 'Aweiridh. Scattered clans are to be found among their kinsmen, the Siba', and with the Beni Sakhr in the Belqa. There is besides ''■'■'■qiniiiw ||M —w—aaaBgi64 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES Tribe. IT. Malik Suh-Tribe.

The Harb The HARB are Ahl esh-Shimal. They are a powerful and warlike tribe of the Hejaz and of Nejd, occupying the coast of the Red Sea from Yambo' to Qunfudah, the mountain country between Medina and Mecca, and the desert to the north-east up to Jebel Abanat. Inland, their country extends just across the Wadi er-Rummah. On the south they push down to the Sha'ib el-'Useibiyat and the Harrat Qishb, i. e. the vicinity of the caravan road from Boreidah to Mecca, if the Ateibah are in their southern pastures; but this country is really the dira of the latter. In the days of the Emir Mohammed of Ha'il, the eastern Harb paid tribute to the Rashid ; but they are now independent. The clans in the Hejaz come under the influence of the Sherif, though they pay him tribute only when it suits them. They are responsible for the safety of the southernmost section of the Hejaz Railway, but their connexion with the pilgrim traffic is chiefly of a less re spectable kind ; for they rob caravans on the Mecca road, kill and plunder stragglers, and extort money at every opportunity. Their k Auf and Le habah clans are noted highwaymen, much dreaded by the Pilgrimage. The Harb of the Hejaz (Beni Salim and Masruh) are mostly cultivators, fishermen, and carriers. The Beni Salim are also camel-breeders, and so are the Nejd clans of the Beni 'Amr; but none of the Harb are specially rich in camel herds. They are divided into three (or two ?) big sub-tribes. The Beni Salim live in the Hejaz, though there is a small branch of the Muzeinat in thee TRIBES OF THE CENTRAL WEST 65 A, ft , Watt LaMii idwai e IW m Mat d Ali Rum it and , Borei : but south-east parts of Sinai. The Subh, one of their sub-tribes, are almost entirely nomad and have a reputation for bravery and valour. The other sub tribes are half settled, half pastoral, with the exception of the Quwwad, a tribe of menials, camel-drivers, and negroes, divided between the Beni Salim and the Masruh. The chief Sheikhs of the Subh are Khalil el-Ahmed, who is 25 years old, and Sherif ibn Kami, a man of 60. The Beni 'Amr own the date-growing district of Eur' near Medina, but their principal Sheikh. Ez-Zuweibi, is generally in Nejd. He is about 18 or 20 years of age, a strong partisan of the Sherif. The sub-tribe of the Jahm are Shiahs. The Masruh have charge of the caravan road and hold Rabugh. A big sub-tribe, the Zobeid (Zubeid), are fishermen and sailors along the coast from Jiddah to Yambo'. Mostly settled in villages, they are of a stock despised by purely nomadic Arabs. Their paramount Sheikh, Husein ibn Mubeirik, lives at Rabugh. His territory extends from Masturah in the north to Quliyah in the south. A large group of the Zobeid is established in Mesopotamia, where they are cultivators and herdsmen. The Beni 'Ali, at Medina, are a turbulent confederation, bitterly hostile to the Turks. They are at present strongly influenced by the Sherif, and before the recent revolt were used by him to keep the town in a state of unrest and disorder. They are a much rougher people than any of the Beni Salim, and are sometimes said not to be of the Harb race. stem I lent, rif, tit respoii 5 Rait a less id,t ity. t Ireadti Tribe.

The Ateibah The ATEIBAH {'Uteibah) are the most powerful tribe in Central Arabia, strong in arms and great camel-breeders. Among all the e j.jiet nomads they are second in importance only to the Anazah. They occupy the eastern side of the Hejaz with the volcanic dir between the Hajj road and the Central Arabian steppes. Their pas- turages run east to Qasim and Woshm, and south to the diras of the * Qahtan, of the Buqum and Shalawah, and of the Sebei'. This country jtafl. a bounds in wells ; it has a regular if small rainfall in winter, and is n, ^ no t wholly dry in early autumn, when it receives the end of the j monsoon rains. It supports large herds of sheep and camels, and in wfleJ P^ aces ^ ie grass grows so richly that the Bedouins gather a hay-crop ; band® everywhere there is a low growth of acacias, and game is plentiful. e 268 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES The clans in the Hejaz, such as the Helissah, Meraukhah, Kurzan, Sebbahah, Marashidah, and Semarrah, are small in numbers and breed sheep only. There is little cultivation in the no more than palm-groves and small Ateibah villages. i . _ TI ig two great divisions of the tribe are the Ru0,311 and. the BcrQ&amp;ii. The Ruqah are chiefly in the Hejaz, the Berqah in the eastern desert. The paramount Sheikh of the Berqah, Mohammed ibn Hindi, used to be a close friend and ally of Ibn Sa'ud, rode with him in raiding expeditions and aided him with fighting men. But the relation of the Ateibah to the Sherif and Ibn Sa'ud respectively has been somewhat modified of late. The tribe used to belong to Ibn Sa'ud's confedera tion, only those clans which actually inhabited the Hejaz coming under theSherif: butatthesametimeAteibahsympathieswereonthewhole with the Sherif, possibly because he was farther away and exercised a less direct control. In 1910 his second son, 'Abdullah, raided Qasim. nominally on behalf of the Ateibah Sheikhs. He captured Sa'd the brother of 'Abdel-'Aziz ibn Sa'ud ; but the support which he expected from Ibn Rashid was not forthcoming, and when the Emir 'Abd el-'Aziz appeared in force he made terms with him and retired. Ibn Sa'ud undertook that the Ateibah should be tax-free, and that the Qasim should pay the Sherif £4,000 a year._ The first part of this arrangement was not observed by Ibn Sa ud (and m all probability the second part met with as little respect). JJo sooner had 'Abdullah gone back to the Hejaz than the Emir raided the Ateibah on the ground that they had harboured the rebellious Aulad Sa'ud, the grandsons of his uncle, who had tried to raise Kharj and Hariq against him. Ini915 'Abdullah returned to the charge. He carried an expedition as far as the province of Sedeir in Nejd, levied taxes from the eastern Ateibah, and had a successful encounter with the Barriyah, who are allies of the Muteir and subjects of Ibn Sa'ud. The Ateibah are foes of the Harb, than whom they are more powerful; they are generally on good terms with the two small tribes on their southern frontier, the Buqum and Shalawah, and at feud with the Qahtan.70 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES 8. Minor Tribes of % Several small independent tribes share the south part of Hejaz with the two greater tribes, Harb and Ateibah, of which the first lies along the coast, the second inland from Ta'if. They are all, in part, settled or half-settled, and all acknowledge the authority of the Sherif. {a) The Hudheil (Hatheil) are divided into two main sections, a northerly and a southerly. The first ranges east and south of Mecca, and especially along the road between that city and Ta'if, the second beyond Ta'if. No. l is said to have seven clans : Mutarafah (Wadi Eatimah), Mas'ud (ET es-Seil), Sowahar (Ri' es-Seil), B. 'Amr, Met'an (from Mecca to Jiddah), Lahiyan (east of Mecca), Janabir (El-K6r). No. II has eight clans: Garhiyah, Marzuqiyah, Sarwani, Kabkabi, B. Eahm, Nadwiyah, Dadiyah, and 'Abdiyah. (b) Beni Faham, a small tribe living in Wadi Waghar, to the east of the Juhadlah and between them and the Beni Thaqif. They are entirely nomadic and are noted for their skill in tracking. They are friendly with the Beni Thaqif and Juhadlah, and are still faithful to Sherif 'All, the deposed Sherif of Mecca. The Chief Sheikh is Ismail ibn Dahyan. They number about 1,000 men. Related to the Qoreish. (c) The Juhadlah are an entirely nomad tribe with no defined limits, but such boundaries as they have may be said to start just south of Serum (Serom), the southern limit of the Harb, and run thence almost to Lith, covering all the coast and taking a wide sweep inland to the east of Jebel Abu Shauk and Jebel Sa'diyah. Their neighbours on the south are the Al Mahdi and Dhawi Barakat and, to the north-east of Lith, the Beni Faham. They also mingle with the Dhawi Surur and Shenabrah to the south of Mecca, and are generally to be found along the road from Mecca to Jebel 'Arafat and east to Shaddad and Jebel Mohram. From Serum to Lith, however, is their original district, the chief centre being round Sa'diyah. They number about 4,000 men and, although good fighters, are not quarrelsome. Their country is a poor one, and affords scanty pasturage to their herds of camels, in which they are fairly rich. In times of drought they go south to Wadi Dokhah in the Dhawi Barakat country. They do not cultivate, but buy all their grain from Ta'if or Lith, in return for the which they sell. They all carry spears and knives, and, those who can afford them, rifles.I JS- TRIBES OF THE CENTRAL WEST 71 For purposes of internal administration the tribe is divided into two parts, the one under Mohammed ibn Sa'id, the other under Mohammed ibn Hanesh. The former is faithful to the Sherif of Mecca. Sheikh Mohammed ibn Hanash, who rules over the Al Munif or Munifiyah, dislikes the Sherif, owing to his habit of commandeering camels whenever his followers go to Mecca, and therefore keeps chiefly to Sa'diyah and the coast. He has made over tures to Idrisi, but is too far off and too weak to do more than sympa thize with him. He was neutral during the Turco-Sherifian expedition in 1910, and removed his tribe into the inaccessible mountains. The two chief Sheikhs are on good terms with each other and the sub-tribes freely intermingle. They are friendly towards the Dhawi Hasan and Beni Faham, but inimical to the Harb. The Ateibah, though distant, raid them when they stray too far east. The Hudheil and they are of one origin and are on terms of the closest friendship^ The Juhadlah are hospitable to strangers, but they have little religion and seldom go on the Pilgrimage. In person they are taller than most Arabs, wear their hair short, and are dressed in a red ' tob' (thub) which reaches from the waist to the knee, the end being thrown over the left shoulder.

Chief Clans: El-Mujeishah. Ahmed ibn Mas'udah. Al Hasan. Ibn Ahmed er-Rideini.i 72 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES (e) The Beni Malik of the Hejaz are a small tribe numbering not more than 2,000 men, who live in the mountains inland of Lith. The adjoining tribes are the Beni Sa'd on the north, the Shalawah nomads on the east, the Zahran on the south, and the Juhadlah on the west. The Beni Malik are not a fighting tribe, but they are hospitable and industrious, and cultivate figs and grapes in the wadis, as well as wheat, barley, and dhura. During the Pilgrimage season most of them go to Mecca and Jiddah and act as porters. They thus come more into contact with the outside world than most tribes and are more civilized. They are devoted to the Sherif and pay him taxes. Nasir ibn Rawwaf is their chief Sheikh. They live at peace with their neighbours, except the Shalawah, who occasionally raid them. Most of their villages are clustered in Wadi Luz and Wadi Rumman. (/) The Shenabrah are a small nomad tribe to the south of Mecca, numbering not more than 150 men. They are one of the 21 Ashraf clans (see pp. 406 ff.), and, being nearly related to the 'Abadilah, support the Sherif of Mecca. Sherif Judallah is their head. The Shenabrah are brave and lawless, and are generally at loggerheads with the Dhawi Surur. ((/) The Dhawi Surur number about 200 men and wander over the country to the south of Mecca, being entirely nomadic. They are one of the 21 Ashraf clans, and are connected with the Dhawi Zeid. They are opposed to the Shenabrah. Sherif Dukhan is their chief Sheikh. Clans are Aulad El-Hasan and A1 'Aziz. They all obey the Sherif. (A) The Beni Thaqif, a tribe descended from Himyar in the highlands to the south of Ta'if. They are bounded on the north by the northern section of Juhadlah, on the south by the Beni Nasri, east by the Shalawah, and west by the Beni Faham. They are almost entirely settled and agricultural, and grow cereals, grapes, and other fruits for the Ta'if market. For water they depend partly on the summer rains, but chiefly on well water. Nasir ibn Ghuzeil is their chief Sheikh, a firm adherent of the Sherif of Mecca. He commands about 2,000 fighting men. In times of crisis they combine with the Beni Malik, Beni Sa'd, and Beni Nasri. They are always at feud with the Beni Faham and are not cordial to the Juhadlah. They possess very few camels. A certain proportion of the tribe lives permanently in Ta'if. The chief sub-tribes are Sufyan, Mu'adhdher, and Rabi'ah. {i) The Beni Sa'd, a tribe which traces its descent to Himyar. \iS* TRIBES OF THE CENTRAL WEST 73 ingi It is bounded on the north by the Nasri, on the south by the Beni 3f Lii Malik, east by the Shalawah, and west by the Beni Faham and lalai southern Juhadlah. Their country is more fertile than that of n . y • ^ idlahi their northern neighbours, wells being plentiful, and they raise heyai cereals and fruits. There are no nomads amongst them. They i intl favour the Emir of Mecca and can provide him with about 1,000 grimas men. porta Hamsa ibn Mohammed is their chief Sheikh. Id tk There is enmity between them and the Shalawah, and with the ,eSW Juhadlah they are by no means friendly. They combine with the Beni Thaqif, Beni Malik, and Nasri in times of danger. 9. Tribes of the NE. Certain tribes which inhabit the region between Northern Asir M« and Southern Nejd (so far as this is not occupied by the Ateibah) must Ask be mentioned, although it is very doubtful if any of them can be bam regarded as predominantly nomadic. It is certain, in any case, that d. lj a large proportion of their members are partly settled, either in the ;erheat upper valleys of the inland Asiri wadis or in the Nejd oases ; and it is probable that enough of them are now permanent cultivators to lei on deprive the tribes of the Bedouin character they once had. Com- , Tk paratively little, however, is known about them. ! Dlw The most numerous and important tribe is the SEBEP, whose is tit home-land is the ill-known region of Wadi Sebei', which lies between Pheyi N. Asir and Woshm and appears to include the lower basins of two of the great Asiri wadis, Turabah and Ranyah. Not only, however, are in 1 settled Sebei' found also in towns and villages of almost all the Nejd [6 noil districts, but nomad members wander even east of these into Sum- ii Nas man, and over many parts of Eastern Toweiq. The nomad element of jiey j the tribe numbers at least 1,000 tents, and is divided in allegiance, graff fhe Sebei of Wadi Turabah being tributary to the Sherif, while the j parti rest (the larger part) acknowledge Ibn Sa'ud. The whole tribe is Gh® either Wahabite or Hanbali Sunnite. 3a. 5 . Tlle names of some seventeen sub-tribes are known, but almost all is ttf m connexion with settled Sebei'. kf Connected with the Sebei' and possibly constituting a sub-tribe , Itctl only are the SAHUL (or Shaul), of which nomad members range ,po# ^ We J d an . d mto Hasa. If identical with the SHALAWAH, their bes i' home-land is Wadi Sebei'. But it is practically certain that they are now more settled than nomadic and have become only less a per- j^y, manent element of the Nejd population than the Fadhul. They74 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES have probably not above 300 tents, and in religious colour and political allegiance follow the Sebei'. The BUQUM are intimately connected with the two foregoing tribes, but are both more predominantly nomadic and less scattered abroad. They are found in the basins of all the inland Asiri wadis, including Wadi Bishah, and appear to be accepted equally by the Ateibah on the north and the Qahtan on the south, and to divide their allegiance in the same manner as the Sebei'. They are said to have about 500 tents. C. Tribes of the Central South 1. The The Q AH TAN are almost the only very ancient Arabian people which still maintains its importance as a tribal unit. They are, according to Arab tradition, the mother-stock of the Ahl Qibli, and it is not improbable that for a very long period of time they may have occupied their present district near 1 he southern limits of the habitable desert. No travellers have penetrated into their country and little is known about them. Strange, and seemingly quite base less, accounts of their customs are repeated among the northern tribes ; for, like all distant and unknown peoples, they are a peg on which to hang marvels. Their country lies to the west of Hautah and is divided into three districts, Hasat, Areiji, and Tathlith, the last being near Asir. The Shahran and the Sebei' he to the west, the Dawasir to the south and south-west, the Buqum and Shalawah to the north. Somewhere north of Bishah is the Bilad Qahtan, with a group of villages known as the Qahtaniyah (Tarid, 'Azim, and Kir'an are among their number), and the Beni Wahhab villages inhabited by a small tribe of that name. The Qahtan acknowledge the authority of Ibn Sa'ud and join him in his raiding expeditions. So far as they are Moslems at all, they are Hanbali Sunnites or Wahabites. They come up to Shaqrah in the Woshm for dates, and when they are camping in the southern parts of their country they buy dates from the Dawasir villagers, but they themselves have no lands m the valley and are not cultivators. They are very rich in camels, which are sold to the Qasim buyers when the herds come north, towards Nejd. The settled section of the Qahtan, which includes six autonomous tribes and owns the para mount authority of Mohammed ibn Dhuleim, is dealt with later (pp. 132, 441 ft).TRIBES OF THE CENTRAL SOUTH 75 uran regon att® 2. The D iwi The nomadic DAWASIR are Wahabite and more or less under byfi Ibn Sa'ud. Half-settled, they have villages in the Wadi Dawasir, ) it which they inhabit during the summer. They breed camels, though ; said not in such large quantities as the Qahtan. The Qasim dealers do not come as far south as the Dawasir, but the latter bring their camels into the Hasa and dispose of them there to the Qusman. The Dawasir have overflowed into the easterly provinces of Southern Nejd, and now form a considerable settled element in Aflaj, where they are the chief owners of land, worked by men of n pen the fellah tribe of Beni Khadhir. To a less extent they are found hey 11 also in Hariq and 'Aridh, where they contribute a proportion of the ibli,! village and even the town population. Small parties of their beyi nomads wander between Nejd and Hasa and trouble the routes, tsoiti A considerable body is settled in Bahrein. Indeed, so small a ■ cent proportion of the Dawasir is in any sense Bedouin, that the tribe uteb hardly comes within our purview here ; for the settled clans see The SHAMMAR are northern Arabs. They do not spring from a single ancestor, but account for themselves by saying that they d ; oi ti are a mixture of Taghlib, 'Abs, and Hawazin, the first a constituent U ^ of Rabi'ah, the two last of Mudhar. The Ja'far, to which the ruling ^jji family of the Rashld belongs, is a sub-tribe of 'Abdah, and the 'Abdah . eII1 j{ claim descent from the 'Abidah, a part of the settled Qahtan: they y| could, therefore, be Yemenites. Beyond these vague traditions, the | Shammar are ignorant of their own history before they established 'J themselves in Jebel Shammar, ' the two mountains of Tayy ' fre- j quently mentioned in pre-Mohammedan literature, where they dis- placed (and probably partly incorporated) the ancient Tayy nation, 5 a branch of the Qahtan. About the middle of the seventeenth W1 century they began to stretch their frontiers into the Syrian Desert, where they encountered, and, after a brief struggle, defeated, the noii Chap. XVI, pp. 604 ff. apt [ H»t Tatt ie D. Tribes of the Central East 1. TheShammar76 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES Mawali, then the most powerful tribe in the northern steppe, driving them into the north-east borders of Syria. Early in the nineteenth century the Anazah forced the Shammar northwards across the Euphrates, and split the tribe into two parts, interposing themselves between these two in the Syrian Desert. Thus the Shammar of JebelShammar and those of the Jezirah (Mesopotamia) came to be geographically and politically distinct. The southern group follows Ibn Rashid, the northern Ibn Jerba. But ethnologi- cally they are one ; the same sub-tribes are found in either group, and though they do not offer united resistance to their common enemy, the Anazah, they are always on terms of friendship with one another. Any small sheikh of the Jezirah may bring down his tents and flocks to Jebel Shammar for a year's pasturage, if he be so minded. The SOUTHERN SHAMMAR must be considered, not only as a powerful nomad tribe,, but also as the masters of the oases in J. Shammar. The settled population of the latter is mostly of the Beni Ta rn Ti n, an ancient branch of Mudhar which once inhabited all North- East Arabia, but now has relinquished the nomadic life (see p. 81). The Shammar, for their part, are nomads, though they come down to the oases during the summer drought. The Emir of J. Shammar plays a double part. He is Paramount Chief of his own tribal con federation ; but also he is ruler of a settled country, of which Ha'il is the capital, a prince with a fixed habitation, exercising authority over other Bedouins whose connexion with him is not tribal but political. The Shammar tribal frontiers remain more or less un changed, but the sphere of the Emir's influence varies with the vicissi tudes of his dynastic fortunes. The Shammar tribe ranges the south-east Netud and the country to the north almost up to Nejef. To the east its limits have been somewhat restricted by the Dhafir, who are always at feud with it and encroach upon its dira. Since the old eastern pilgrim road, the Darb Zobeidah, is seldom safe from Dhafir raids, it has been aban doned by the Emir's caravans in favour of a more wes- erly track past the fortified wells of Hayyaniyah; but the proper Shammar pasture-grounds extend up to it and across it. To the north, the loss of Jauf el-'Amr has shut the Shammar into the Nefud. They do not wander far beyond J. Trnan on the west, nor south wards beyond Mustajiddah ; while the summer camping-ground of Beidha Nethil is occupied sometimes by Shammar, but mostly by the Anazah of the Teima district.TRIBES OF THE CENTRAL EAST 77 |dnii The political influence of Ha'il has decreased notably since the death of the Emir Mohammed, in 1897. At the height of his power nai ruled over Riyadh and the Qasim, and levied tribute from the ro l* Northern Harb, the Huteim, Fuqara, Wuld Suleiman, and Beni ^ Wahhab. The Southern Shammar tribes, great breeders of sheep potai anc [ camels, number something under 4,000 tents. The villages of soul j ghammar contain probably not much over 20,000 souls. Both tbol tribesmen and villagers are devotedly loyal to the Emir. The sub- er ?&gt;■ ject tribes from whom he might be able, on occasion, to raise fight- con j n g m en number at most 1,200 tents. Teima, which is subject to him, must have a population of from 1,500 to 2,000. doffli At a rough estimate Ibn Rashid could probably raise from 500 i ^ to 800 fighting men from the villages, and 2,000 from the Shammar tribes. He might obtain another 500 or 600 from the tribes between Jebel Shammar and Teima, though their support would always be •'•I doubtful. The tribesmen would bring their own camels, but they isesi would depend on the Emir for food and ammunition. The villagers :ty he would have to mount and arm as well as feed. His own camel ill Hi herds, seriously reduced in numbers since the days of the Emir eepJ Mohammed, may now amount to about 1,000 camels, including edoif those which are not yet fit for service. The Shammar tribes are Shai not as rich in camels as the Anazah, but they must average some ribal 1 20-30 camels to a tent, which would bring the numbers up to 80,000 bichi or rather more, including breeding camels and calves, autk The relations between the Shammar and the Muteir are usually libali hostile. With the Dhafir the Shammar are always at feud, but the r less Muntefiq were recently on good terms with Ibn Rashid. The he vis Huteim are out of hand and raid Shammar territories when the Emir is occupied with distant expeditions against the Ruweilah or e com the Dhafir. On the western borders, the Huweitat are the foes of all javel Shammar, except the sub-tribe of Rammal, with whom one of their jc lfi Paramount Sheikhs is connected by marriage. The B. 'Atiyah are ro ai hereditary enemies, and the Juheinah and Billi raid both the Wuld eel i t Suleiman and the Shammar. er lyti Arab tribal federations or states, however, are held together only Sha® 1 by an autocratic ruler, and their strength increases or diminishes in jjojjjii exact ratio to his weight and capacity. The Southern Shammar ie jjd had their day under the Emir Mohammed. Since his death they lor J have been handicapped by the violence and folly of their leaders. r01] ji But, nevertheless, their numbers, their great tradition, and the sup- ilostl; port of the Ottoman Government make them still one of the chief factors in Central Arabian politics.78 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES The NORTHERN SHAMMAR of the Jezirah are variously esti mated. Probably a total of 2,000 tents is not far from the true figure ; but they have been put as high as 10,000 tents. Their pasture-grounds are between the Tigris and the Euphrates, though occasionally they cross the Tigris in the region of the Lesser Zab. They come down to Baghdad and even south of Baghdad as far as Zobar. To the west they extend to Deir ez-Z6r, which is a head quarters of the tribe ; thence north up the Khabur and to near Nisibin they wander over the fertile desert which is watered by the Jaghjagh and its affluents. They are at feud with their Anazah neighbours, both Eed'an and 'Amarat, and usually on bad terms with the Kurdish tribes to the north and north-east. Traditional rebels against Ottoman authority, they slip between the fingers of the Mutesarrif of Deir and the Vali of Mosul, paying taxes to neither. They exact dues from the caravans on the Tigris road and not in frequently hold up the traffic along this important link between Asia Minor and Baghdad, forcing travellers, and sometimes even the Government post, to take the longer route by Irbil and Kerkuk. The keleks on the river are subject to their exactions also. In 1911, the cup of their iniquities having overflowed, Nazim Pasha, then Vali of the 'Iraq, sent an expedition against them under his chief of staff, Hasan Riza Bey (murdered during the siege of Scutari in the fol lowing year). He conducted matters very skilfully. The Shammar came in without resistance, camel- and sheep-dues, many years in arrear, were collected at a great camp formed at Hatrah, and the rights of the tribe over the Mosul road were defined. But the fall of Nazim immediately afterwards, and the resignation of Hasan Riza, took the heart out of this agreement. The Shammar of the Jezirah are all under the sheikhly family of the Jerban, who sprang into political importance about 1830 with Sheikh Sufuq ibn Jerba, a bitter enemy of the Turks. His eldest son, Ferhan, was a lover of peace and kept on good terms with the Government; but the contest was continued by Ferhan's brothers, of whom the youngest, Faris, took refuge in J. Shammar with Ibn Rashid. He returned to the Jezirah in the seventies, and from that time shared the position of Paramount Sheikh with Ferhan. He took the camping-grounds on the Khabur, while Ferhan held those round Mosul, with his head-quarters at Hatrah, and on the brackish springs of the Wadi Tharthar. In 1911 'Asi, the eldest of Ferhan's sixteen sons, was appointed by Hasan Riza Bey Paramount Sheikh and made responsible to the Government for all Mesopotamian Shammar. He is a man advanced in years, peaceable and upright.TRIBES OF THE CENTRAL EAST 79 He keeps to the Mosul district, while two of his cousins, 'AM el- Muhsin and Mohammed, sons of 'Abd el-Kerim, roam the Khabur country. The sons of Faris are young and not of much account. The eldest now living, Mish'al, is nephew, through his mother, of Noweidis et-Timyat of the Tuman (Shammar of the Jebel). Some of the many sons of Ferhan own cultivated land on the southern reaches of the Tigris, and one, Humeidi, has almost dropped nomad habits and passes much of his time in a house which he has built in Baghdad. Between 'Amarah and Baghdad there is a group of small tribes, the Tauqah (Toga), who call themselves Shammar, though they are of mixed blood. They are half-nomadic, going out into the desert west of the Euphrates in spring with their sheep and donkeys, and coming back into their Jezirah villages in the summer. The chief of these tribes are the Mas'ud (Mes'ud), between Museyyib and Kerbela, the Zagarit, round Kerbela, and the Zauba' (Zoba), five hours west of Baghdad. They are Shiah, and, like all settled Arabs, fairly numerous. SHAMMAR OF NEJD Tribe. 'Abdah. 1,500 tents Ibn Jebrin Ibn'Ajil Ibn 'Ali ban. leld^ Aslam. 1,200 tents , wl Dhari et-Tawalah Sub-Tribe.

Beni Tamlm The BENI TAMlM are a famous stock of the northern people, who played an important part in Arabian history before the age of the Prophet, when they extended from the Syrian Desert to Yemamah. They maintain their ancient seat, for they still form a large pro portion of the settled population of Nejd and Jebel Shammar; the oases of the Qasim are almost exclusively inhabited by them and by the B. Khalid. But they are no longer an independent tribe ; they acknowledge the authority of Ibn Sa'ud or of Ibn Rashid. At a very early date, probably before the Mohammedan invasion, they began to come up into Mesopotamia, where they are still to be found near Tarmiyah (some 1,500 families). All these are shepherds, and while the Tamim of Nejd are strict Wahabites, their kinsmen of Mesopotamia are Shiahs. 3. The Dhafir Dhufir) The DHAFIR form an important tribe whose district extends south of the Shatt el-'Arab and Euphrates from near Zobeir to Samawah. From Samawah a line drawn almost due south to the vicinity of Hafar in the Batin would mark their frontier, and the depression of the Batin forms the SE. side of the triangle which encloses their territory. Their neighbours are the Muntefiq confede ration to the NE., the Shammar to the W., the Muteir and 'Ajman to the E., while to the south they are in touch with the Sebei', one of the tribes which acknowledges the authority of Ibn Sa'ud. The Samid section, and more particularly the Juwasim (or Jawasim, orig. Qawasim), are accustomed to cross the Euphrates in the summer and pasture their flocks in the 'Iraq. The Dhafir are foes of the Muteir and are almost always on bad terms with the Shammar, whom they raid when they are in their spring pasturages east of the Nefud. They harry the Darb Zobeidah and hold up the Emir's caravans from Ha'il to Nejef; indeed the Darb Zobeidah has become so unsafe that the western pilgrimage road is now almost always chosen by caravans in preference to it. arabia i82 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES For the past year, however, the paramount Sheikh, Hamud ibn Suweit, has been at peace with Ibn Rashid, though he is said to have rejected the latter's proposal that he should join him in aiding 'Ajeimi ibn Sa'dun and the Turks against the British. The Shammar sub-tribe of the 'Ajil are still hostile to the Dhafir. With the Anazah they are always at feud, and though the Anazah sheikhs seldom approach within four or five days' journey of their country, the Dhafir carry their raids as far north as Shifathah, and west into the Anazah pastures. They are on good terms with some of the Muntefiq group, of whom the Budur camp habitually under their protection in the spring, when the latter go out with their sheep into the desert. But with the Sa'dun themselves their relations have been anything but cordial, and since 1915 Hamud has definitely sided against 'Ajeimi; but he has not succeeded in carrying his whole tribe with him, and the Husein and Dhar'an sections, as well as other smaller sheikhs of the Samid, have followed 'Ajeimi's lead against us. The Dhafir are composed of two main sub-tribes, the Butun and the Samid, of which the Butun is the more numerous. It is not a homogeneous tribal unit, but has been formed from sections of other tribes which have been welded together. The various constituents have preserved the memory of their origin ; the Suweit and the Beni Husein are Ashraf of the Hejaz ; the Sa'id, 'Areif, and Beni Khalid, with the Kathir who are an offshoot of the Beni Khalid, are Qahtan; the 'Adwan are Ahl esh-Shimal, descended from Rabi'ah or Mudhar ; the Misamir and the small Tuluh clans are Anazah ; the Rasimi are Shammar, the Mu'aleim are Beni Tamim, and the Juwasim are from the neighbouring Sebei'. The important Dhar'an section are 'Abid, that is to say, they spring from the slaves of some nomad group. The Dhafir are wholly nomadic and do not engage in any trade. Their country is sufficiently supplied with wells, and they own large flocks of sheep, besides being breeders of camels. In religion they are Sunnis of the Maliki sect. They are well armed with modern rifles and may number some 3,000 fighting men. They maintain good relations with the Sultan of Koweit and come into Koweit for needful provisions and utensils. Sections of the tribe near the Koweit territory have occasionally paid the Sultan tribute ; while in the days of Mohammed er-Rashid the western sections of the Dhafir yielded tribute to the Shammar. The paramount Sheikh, Hamud ibn Suweit, is a man of about 45, intelligent, and reckoned a fairly good politician and tribal administrator. His son, Barghash, is a boy of 17.84 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES The BARRlYAH are an independent tribe, but so closely allied with the Muteir that they are often held to be of saine political relations they are at one with the Muteir, and, like them, thev come under the authority of Ibn Sa'ud. Their pasturages are in Oasim. The last report concerning them is that they opposed 'Abdullah, the second son of the Sherif, when he raided Sedeir at the end of 1914 in order to collect overdue taxes from the eastern Ateibah, and that after some fighting they were defeated.

Stranded witnesses to its former wide range are to be found in a Khalid element of the settled popu lation of Qasim (especially at Aneizah), of Zilfi in Sedeir, of Malhani in 'Aridh, and elsewhere in Nejd. The main remnant, however, is the Bedouin tribe of the name which ranges north of the 'Ajman on the Gulf shore between the Wadi Maqta' on the north and the middle of the Bayadh district on the south. Inland they wander into the Summan plateau. Scattered communities have settled in various outside localities, e.g. Oman, Musallamiyah Island, Qatif, the Hasa Oasis, Bahrein, and Koweit, where the tribesmen have become pearl-fishers, &amp;c. The nomads own considerable date-groves.{4c •\ri TRIBES OF THE CENTRAL EAST 85 Up to 1830 the Beni Khalid ruled the Hasa ; but they had long been at war with the Wahabites, to whom, being themselves Maliki Sunnites, they are unsympathetic, and they finally succumbed to the Emir Turki of Riyadh. Latterly, after recognizing Turkish suzer ainty, more or less, for forty odd years, they have come again under Riyadh. They are great breeders of horses and cattle, and culti vate more than most Bedouins. Their tents are noted for their great size; and in dress (they wear the fine Hasa abbas), deportment, physiognomy, and coloration, these nomads are more like oasis- dwellers than Bedouins. They number about 14,000 souls, and claim to send out 4,000 fighting men. They are in alliance with the 'Ajman and share diras with that tribe, but maintain feuds with the Muteir and the Ahl Murrah. A small, isolated section ranges north of Koweit with the Dhafir. The tribe is well armed and more trustworthy than the 'Ajman. Its Paramount Chief is the Sheikh of a settled clan, A1 Khalid, of the 'Ama'ir sub-tribe, who lives on the island of Musallamiyah. For the settled Beni Khalid see below, pp. 572, 608.

The The 'AJMAN, who range south of the Beni Khalid, trace their descent to Qahtan through Nafura of Nejran; but this pedigree is not accepted by Arab genealogists in general. They are, however, an important Bedouin tribe, which is the strongest nomad unit on the Gulf Coast, although its claim to turn out 10,000 fighting men is excessive. It is singularly at one within itself, its different sub-tribes and clans not having distinct diras, or falling into sectional groups. 'Ajmi tribesmen of all sections may be found in any camp in any part of the range of the tribe. It also appears to have unusual instinct for federation with its weaker neighbours, thus securing more elbow-room. Under ordinary conditions both the Beni Khalid and the Beni Hajar are its allies, n86 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES and the 'Ajman have free range in their diras. The whole tribe is well provided with breech-loading firearms, and being Sunnite of the Hanbali school, it is sympathetic to Wahabism and has some of its dour spirit. m ^ i Its proper summer range is the Gulf lowlands from Tafi down to ' Oqair, enveloping the Hasa oasis on north and east. Inland it ranges back over the Summan plateau, where its herdsmen wander in winter as far west as the confines of Sedeir ; and at the same season 'Ajman push even into Kharj. On the littoral they straggle some times into El-Qatar, and habitually wander north up to Koweit, relying on their agreement with the Beni Khalid, whose proper dira they thus invade. They are to be found, therefore, at one season or another, over an area of not less than 20,000 square miles. Very few 'Ajmi tribesmen have ever adopted settled life, though they own some date-groves in Hasa. Their wealth lies in horses, camels, and the smaller cattle. In particular they are horse-breeders. They may total between 4,000 and 5,000 tents. During the Ottoman occupation of Hasa and Qatif the 'Ajman were consistently recalcitrant, in spite of subsidies doled out to their sheikhs and the screw which could be put upon the tribe when, according to its custom, it camped near Hofuf, and wished to dispose of live stock, &amp;c., in the local markets. They maintained the while relations of old standing with the Emirs of Riyadh, and welcomed 'Abd el-'Aziz es-Sa'ud when he invaded Hasa in 1913. But when his became the established government the 'Ajman liked him and his taxes little better than the Turks, and he had to orgamze drastic punishment of their raiding in the summer of 1915, finally driving great part of them north into Shammar country. Their traditional foe is the Ahl Murrah tribe, and of late they have added Ibn Rashid and the Shammar. With the Sultan of Koweit and the Paramount Sheikh of El-Qatar they have generally, though not invariably, kept on terms. The Paramount Chieftainship is in the Ibn Hithlein family oi the Ma'idh sub-tribe (Naja' clan). On the murder of Mohammed ibn Hazm ibn Hithlein in 1910, the chieftainship was put in commis sion ; Sheikh Eahd, the elder brother of the late chief, had most support for the sole succession, but he appears to have given way later to Sheikh Theidan, who submitted to Riyadh at the end of 1915. The Naja' clan is said to be in close alliance with the Sifran sub-tribe, which, though not numerous, contains the most formid able of all the 'Ajmi fighting-men. According to Lorimer of the Persian Gulj) the Jiblan section of the Muteir (q.v.) joined forces with the 'Ajman before 1908.88 THE BEDOUIN TRIBES Sub-Tribe.

The AM The AHL MURRAH (Ahl Morra), a savage and ill-known tribe, wholly nomadic, range to the south of Hasa, into the Jafurah Desert, and down to the wild oasis of Jabrin which lies beyond on the con fines of the great South Desert. On the north they come up to near 'Oqair 1 while inland they lie south of the Hofuf-Riyadh routes (which they harry) as far as the borders of Kharj. In most of this inhospit able tract they wander alone, and neither the Turks nor the Ibn Sa'uds (whose feudatories they nominally are) have ever been able to follow them far enough to subdue them. In 1915-16 they gave the Emir of Riyadh a great deal of trouble. Their savagery and treachery are due mainly to the wild character of their dira, but perhaps their evil reputation is due also in some degree to the small knowledge of them possessed by the outside world. They have, however, physical and linguistic peculiarities, which make it possible that they are survivors of the pre-Arab population of the peninsula, like the inhabitants of Ras Musandam and the Southern Mahrah. They are virtually pagans, but profess, on occasion, Islam of the Hanbali school, which is akin to Wahabism, They are as ill armed as they are ill provided with any domestic apparatus or clothing in advance of the Stone Age ; but they are brave fighters, who have twice in recent years made short work of Turkish punitive detachments. They own many camels.TRIBES OF THE CENTRAL EAST 89 They are said to number about 7,000 souls, and to turn out 2,000 fighting men. Their Paramount Chief is the Sheikh of the Fuheidah clan of the Shabib (or Bishr) sub-tribe, which is notorious for outrages committed on travellers, fishermen, and Turks. The whole tribe is unashamedly predatory, recognizing no code but its own. It maintains perpetual feud with the 'Ajman and the Beni Khalid. AHL MURRAH Sub-Tribe. Clan. Shabih (or Bishr). 'Adhbah.

They are the last predominantly nomadic tribe towards the south, the Great Desert and the Jafurah Desert enclosing their dira S. and W., and the mainly settled and friendly Beni Yas of the Trucial Coast lying E. North lies the dira of the Ahl Murrah, with whom the Manasir seem to be on better terms than any one else is. In winter the whole tribe moves into or near El-Qatar. In summer part of it may be found as far south as the Bireimi oasis in NW. Oman. Mainly pastoral, the Manasir possess arable land and summer settle ments in Dhafrah (Liwah district), and are much in advance of the Ahl Murrah in civilization. Both in religious tenets and political connexions they pertain to Oman. There seems to be no Paramount Mansuri Chief.

The S The SHEBABAT are not reckoned among the Arabs as Bedu, that is to say, they do not spring from either of the great nomad families, Qahtan or Nizar. They are said to be of one stock with the Huteim who, like the Sherarat, are not asll, of known race, and the true Bedouins will not intermarry with them. 1 Nor is there any definite area over which they exercise acknowledged rights of possession ; they have not their own dira, but camp with other tribes. Their tents are scattered from Jebel Duruz in the north to Teima in the south, and east from Kerak to Jebel Shammar. They are to be found among the Sukhur, the Huweitat, the Ruweilah, and the Shammar, either in the encampments of the big Sheikhs, or by preference Ichaldwi, i. e. solitary, in the wilderness. In summer small numbers of Sherarat gather round the fast-drying water-holes and the permanent wells, when the big tribes have moved off with their herds towards the Hejaz Railway and the Jordan valley, or out into the depths of the Hamad. At Hausa in the Jebel Tubeiq, and at Imleih and 'Obeid on the edges of the Nefud, they find enough water for their slender needs, and the hard surface of the desert is covered with the circular marks of their threshing floors where in August they harvest the wild The Sherarat honour an ancestor called Suleim, who is buried in the Wadi Mujib, but they seldom visit his tomb. They have a cult for 'Aqil Weled 'Azzam, whose tomb is in the Jebel Tubeiq. They 1 They are sometimes reckoned, however, as descendants of the Beni HilaLNON-BEDOUIN NOMADS 91 regard the Jebel Tubeiq as their own special dira, while the Sukhur and the Huweitat are intruders. In Ibn Rashid's country the Sherarat will pay tribute to him ; in Moab they pay tribute to the Ottoman Government. Wherever they may be, they must buy the goodwill of the Paramount Sheikh of that region. They are skilled hunters, and their camels are said to be the best in Western Arabia, especially as freight- carriers. Although their small tents are almost destitute of furniture and their coffee-hearths are bare, many of the Sherarat are well-to-do. A man clothed in rags may be the owner of 20 camels, and a Sherari sheikh is a rich man in the desert. But a hunter wandering solitary for a year or more, with his tiny tent, his wife, his single camel and little flock of goats, living mainly on such animals as he can trap, content with black cakes of seed in place of bread, and chewing the green weeds of early spring like one of his own goats, has brought the amenities of existence to the irreducible minimum. The men take service with the cultivators of the Jizah district, and often settle down among them; but their former trade of supplying the Haj j camels with grass from the Nefud has vanished with the opening of the railway. 2. The Closely related to the Sherarat are the HUTEIM (Heteym), and they are even more widely scattered. They are to be found on the Persian Gulf, in Yemen, on the Red Sea, and in Egypt; but their main range is in Central Arabia, from near Medina, north-east to Jebel Shammar. The name Huteim is used roughly by the Arabs as a synonym for any base-born, half-settled tribe. They are rich and numerous ; those of the Kheibar and Medina districts pay taxes to the Government, while those of Jebel Shammar used to be taxed by Ibn Rashid, but are now out of hand and raid his villages when he is away with his fighting men. The Huteim breed excellent riding-camels, and own large flocks of sheep and goats. Their women are renowned for beauty, but would not be taken in marriage by any Bedouin of good stock. The men are reputed to be timid and of no value as fighters. 3. The The SULUBBA (Solubba) are an interesting tribe about whose jf origin nothing certain is known. Probably they are the dispersed ft remnants of some old stock ; but legend has been busy with their , ancestry, and has given them as forbears the Indian dancers of Harun92 NON-BEDOUIN NOMADS er-Rashid's court at Baghdad. They are sprinkled over the whole of nomad Arabia, but the various groups under their separate sheikhs keep to their own regions, where they ply their trades as smiths, tinkers, carpenters, and cattle-surgeons among the Bedouins and the oasis-dwellers. Their skill in hunting has passed into fable with the Arabs; and in fact they are so expert that they live well, even in the most barren wilderness, from the fruits of the chase. They are well-to-do, earning an ample livelihood by their craftsmanship, and they travel without fear throughout all the desert, where no thief would rob them and no raider harry them. Their knowledge of the country is unsurpassed. They have no camels ; their beasts of burden are donkeys, the best breed being a large white ass almost as powerful as a mule. They rear herds of sheep and goats in the Hamad, and their tents are well stocked with every kind of nomad gear. A northern Sulubbi will wear in winter a warm robe of gazelle-skins. The Bedouins accuse them of eating carrion and beasts that have died of themselves, as well as vermin; and there would seem to be truth in the first charge as far as the Suleib (Soleyh) and Ghaneimi are concerned, and in the second if it is limited to locusts and hedgehogs (the locust, however, is a delicacy much prized not only by the Sulubba, but by all nomads). , It is impossible to estimate the numbers of the tribe, since they never assemble in any one place. 4. The The SUNN A' are the smiths' caste, sometimes settled in the villages and sometimes wandering with the tribes is plural of Sdni ' = artisan, smith). They are braziers, farriers, tinners, blacksmiths, and workers in wood and stone among the tribes and in the oases. Thus they are both villagers and nomads. They may marry with the Huteim but with no Bedouins. They are probably a different race from the Arabs, and are distinguished from them by their features. 5. TheNmvdr The NAWAR are gipsies, found in Arabia as in other parts of the universe, but not in great numbers. Their habits and activities are the same there as elsewhere. 6. The The HAWAZIN (HAWAZIM or 'AWAZIM) are a nomad tribe which is not admitted to marriage and fellowship by true Arabs. As a considerable tribal unit it is found only in and about the principality of Koweit, ranging from the outskirts of the townNON-BEDOUIN NOMADS 93 itself (where some 250 Hawazin families are settled), down the coast nearly to Musallamiyah, and for some distance inland. They must be the ' Koweit nomads ' who, Raunkiaer says, graze their herds south of the town in winter and resort in summer northwards to the districts round Zobeir, and also control the wells of Tawil. There are also, however, Hawazin elsewhere, who have the same sort of status, but are members of Huteim or Harb (e.g. in Jauf el-'Amr, Teima, Sedeir, &amp;c.) ; and there is a distinct Harb clan of the name at Wadi el-Kheif near J. Fiqra (see Harb). The Koweit Hawazin are partly pastoral, partly follow marine occupa tions—pearl-diving and fishing. They are great breeders of camels, often taking service (e. g. at Qatif) under alien masters for stud-labour. They are subjects of Koweit, and form the bulk of the Sultan's fighting forces: it is due also to their activities that he is able to claim Bubiyan Island, to which some of their herdsmen resort. They are allied with the 'Ajman, and number some 4,000 souls. It appears that they are comparatively new comers into Koweit territory, and their tradition is that they were formerly with the Harb in East Hejaz. The one thing certain is that they are regarded by Bedouins as of the same standing as Huteim or Sulubba, and credited with secret non-Islamic beliefs. In fact, however, they are Maliki Sunnites.

The 'Uqeil The 'UQEIL (Ageyl) are the guides and conductors of caravans in Arabia. They are not a tribe but an organization partaking of the nature of a club or society or a masonic lodge. They have no connexion with the ancient ^Uqeil tribe of the Ahl esh-Shimal, from whom the Muntefiq claim descent; this seems to have disappeared and left no trace. The modern 'Uqeil are all Nejd Arabs, townsfolk or nomads of any tribe from Hasa, 'Aridh, Qasim or Jebel Shammar; but men of Sedeir and the Wadi Dawasir are not admitted; nor are members admitted from any of the big tribes, such as the Harb and Ateibah, who are engaged in interminable blood feuds, the object being to keep the 'Uqeil society neutral. Settled Beni Tamim and Beni Khalid of Nejd and Qasim are most suitable for its purposes. The head-quarters of the society are at Baghdad, and its president, who is always a native of Boreidah, lives at Baghdad and there enrols the members.NON-BEDOUIN NOMADS 95 , The 'Uqeil are of two kinds: Jemamil, camel-men forming the fraternity of caravan leaders, and Dhogorti, poor men, pedlars and mercenaries, who help to compose an irregular cavalry under the Ottoman flag and serve as escort to the Hajj and as guards to the Tcellas, stations or halting-places, on the Hajj road. These last do not belong to the society. The true 'Uqeil are recognized through out Arabia as professional guides whose presence vouches for a caravan of merchants or travellers and removes it from all suspicion of hostile intentions. It is the 'Uqeil who conduct the camel-trade of the desert, being employed by the dealers of Damascus to pur chase from the tribes in Arabia, in the Syrian Desert, and in Meso potamia. Such an institution as this society, with universal freedom of passage, is essential to the conduct of business in Arabia, where no tribesman, unless he be engaged on a raiding expedition, dare venture outside his own tribal territory for fear of hereditary feuds and enmities which imperil his existence. The possible service they can render to European travellers is dealt with on p. 21. It is very dangerous for such a traveller to assume the character of an 'Uqeil: but Arabs, who wish to shield the caravan in which the tra veller is from molestation, will sometimes impose it on him (this was done to Shakespear near Wadi el-'Arabah in 1914). His best course then is, on the approach of any stranger, to feign illness and remain rolled up, face and all.CHAPTER IV HEJAZ Area As designating a vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, ' Hejaz ' meant the north-western part of Arabia from the head of the Gulf of Akaba to a point between Lith and Qunfudah, about half-way down the eastern Red Sea coast, i.e. it lies between lats. 29° 30' and 20° N. Its inland boundary was never defined, being dependent on the distance to which the Turkish power was able to make itself felt at different periods in the direction of Jebel Shammar and Nejd. Under the Ottoman theoretic arrangement, both these latter districts are included in the vilayet of Basra, and Hejaz is understood to be 'bounded by a line drawn vertically from N. to S. through the desert and steppe E. of Teima. But really the limit of effective Turkish authority, and therefore of the province of Hejaz, has never been pushed E. of the Kheibar oasis. The province measures, therefore, about 700 miles from N. to S. by some 250 W. to E. (175,000 square miles). In native parlance, however, Hejaz does not begin until much farther S., its upper limit being a line drawn inland from the Red Sea coast, just N. of Wejh, through El-'Ala and the steppe-desert to the northernmost point of the Harrat Kheibar. Midian and its hinterland (Hisma) are thus excluded. This limitation of Hejaz has been recognized not only by religious prejudice, but also by the Ottoman Government, in that it has allowed Christians to pass down the Hejaz Railway as far as Meda'in Salih, a few miles N. of El-'Ala, but not S. of it except for some special official reason. Physical Character A. Relief In its widest sense, Hejaz is the northern half of the upraised western edge of the Arabian shelf. The short and steep fall west ward to the Red Sea, however, is interrupted by a second ridge, which lies a short way back from the shore, and in the northern partPHYSICAL CHARACTER 97 (Midian) attains a greater elevation (peaks over 8,000 feet) than the Ridge itself. Hejaz, therefore, comprises five parallel zones : (1) A low, sandy coastal strip (Tihamah) fringed with coral reefs and narrowest in Midian, where, at points, the highlands fall almost into the sea ; (2) a mountainous belt falling in elevation from N. to S., until between Jiddah and Mecca it is hardly 2,000 feet high ; (3) an intramontane plateau belt of great elevation in the N,, where the lava caps of the 'Aweiridh have resisted denudation, but falling southward to under 1,000 feet west of Mecca and Ta'if ; (4) the main Eidge itself, highest where capped with lava, as in the Hisma, ; 'nia 'Aweiridh, and Kheibar harrahs (8,000 to 6,000 ft.), but still keeping Gil a mean elevation of over 5,000 ft. behind Mecca ; (5) the uppermost -aydm fringe of the eastward slope towards Central Arabia. ^ The few centres of settled population lie almost entirely in the 3peA first and third of these zones. The port settlements, Akaba, Mu- to il weilah, Wejh, Umlejh, Yambo', Rabugh, Jiddah, and Lith, with a few shams intermediate groups of huts, are of course in the first, and El-'Ala, )tli tt Medina, and Mecca in the third. The only exceptions of note are Hejai certain rare oases, which lie on the line between the fourth and 3m 1 fifth zones, Teima, Kheibar, Henakiyah, and Ta'if. The Hejaz theli Railway, after following the western edge of the fifth zone from )vinci Ma'an, has to cross a low part (pass of Qal'ah Dar el-Hamra, sis, I 3,700 ft.) of the fourth zone (the £ Ridge ') between Tebuk and to SJ Meda'in Salih in order to reach Medina. From Medina the rails could proceed to Mecca by following the same third zone; but for atil • several reasons, e. g. for better security from interference by nomad &gt; the I tribes, it has been proposed to bring them down westward into the m-k- fi rst zone at Rabugh, and thence up behind Jiddah into the third in and again. of Ef big drainage channels, originating on the main Ridge, traverse als« fhe third zone, and break through the second to the sea, all being istia® ^ke fiuincirci type, i.e. without permanent surface flow. In the ^ mfe north (Midian), where the elevation is great and there is some j reasi P re cipitation from the East Mediterranean area, these deep wadis follow one another in rapid succession. They cut up the country into a series of detached blocks, and force communications from north to south to keep either close along the shore (Egyptian pilgrim route) or within the fifth belt (Syrian pilgrim route and it ^ e '' az Railway)- Nor, owing to their exceedingly steep gradients, 6 «r do they favour communication from west to east, or create fertility. )ia , Midian, therefore, is a conspicuously ill-inhabited, unsettled, and op 1 ' unknown district in a peninsula to almost all parts of which these :tl#f epithets apply in varying degrees. AEABIA I ,,98 HEJAZ In the rest of Hejaz, where the general elevation is lower and the gradients are more gentle, these fiubecome less frecjuent and more beneficent. The most important of them, the Wadi Hamdh, which debouches a few miles S. of Wejh, unites two main channels from the Ridge, one draining the Kheibar the other the 'Aweiridh harrah. The first gives Medina its underground waters and extensive suburban oasis ; the second supplies the palm-groves of El-'Ala. Other wadis of considerable size debouch near Umlejh, Yambo', Rabugh, Qadhimah, Jiddah, and Lith, accounting for isolated patches of oasis not only at those points on the coast, but also in both the inner Tihamah and the third zone, between Medina and Mecca. Oases in the latter zone, however, seldom contain more than one or two permanent habitations, being owned by tribesmen of the surrounding steppes. The valleys of the southern wadis do not affect communications so adversely as in Midian. Indeed the westward course of Wadi Hamdh from Medina, and the con fluence there of a tributary from the south, have facilitated the pilgrim route towards Mecca ; and the others all assist communi cation from the coast, e.g. between Yambo' and Medina ; ^between Rabugh or Jiddah and Mecca ; and between Lith and Ta if. The principal superficial characteristic of Hejaz is general barren ness, relieved only in the first and third zones by rare oases. The littoral zone, except at wadi-mouths, is throughout coralline rock and dusty sand ; the hills of the second zone are of dusty surface where not naked limestone ; the third zone is steppe verging on nefud desert ; the fourth is rocky in the northern part, and frequently harraJi desert; the fifth is stony steppe, softening in the north to sheer nefud. B. Climate It hardly needs to be stated, therefore, that precipitation is insufficient throughout Hejaz. The Midian highlands get a little more than the Egyptian Delta ; the rest of Hejaz a little more than middle Egypt. Except at Ta'if in the extreme south, there are no seasonal rains as in Asir and Yemen. In Mecca precipitation occurs, chiefly in summer, during brief thunderstorms, and water flows down the surface of Hejazi only at very rare intervals, though sometimes in great volume for a day or two. The climate of the Hejaz lowland is little better than that of the Yemen Tihamah, the mean annual temperature beingCLIMATE 99 andti nearer 90° than 80°, and the air damp. Mecca, owing to its enti low elevation (700 to 850 ft.) and its background of naked slopes, Haul is worst off, and is an undesirable summer residence, being like Aai a furnace on a still day; but Medina, with a mean temperature tkt of little over 70°, is healthy throughout the year. Ta'if is the most dmtf salubrious of the Hejaz towns ; it shares the keen dry air which n-gim purifies all the central steppe-lands, except in spots where water is IM: over-abundant near the surface, as at Kheibar. The latter oasis, itingt like Mecca and the coastal settlements, suffers from intermittent 3ast ;■ fevers ; Mecca itself has a bad name also for dysenteric and other tiMei epidemic diseases. The highlands behind Mecca and about Ta'if aim know occasional frost even during summer nights, ritai m *i we Population the# mi tatedt J hc population, settled and unsettled (most of the latter being iomi one seaso n in the province, at another out of it on the E.), may bet® be guessed at well under a million. Only about one-sixth is either i'if. u rban or ' on the land ', five-sixths being Bedouins, wholly or partly ilbaw noma dic, who, generally speaking, are poverty-stricken and there- ses I fore predatory. The principal tribal groups, which range Hejaz, jj^jj are from N. to S. as follows : '■vd extreme north are the Huweitat and the Beni 'Atiyah, wfflii' closel y a ^ e( l' sharing each other's and ranging all Midian, Jj , properly so-called, as well as ' Petraea' from Ma'an down to Dar tj. Jj- el-Hamra on the Hejaz Railway. Their southern limit is the upland : Jau plain through which runs the Wejh-Tebuk track. Some small Sinai tic clans come also into Midian from the NW. ; the Sherarat infringe on it slightly from NE. ; and small groups of Huteim camp in it. But properly it is Huweitat and 'Atiyah country. Immediately south of Midian and in the region north of ' Hejaz ' (in the strictly religious limitation of that term to the provincial pitati precinct of the ' Haramein ') range the Mawahib (Moahib) and the ret a® ' the former inland, in the southern 'Aweiridh harrdh country little ^ no rth of Meda in Salih and El-'Ala, the latter on the coast north of, )utli,i an u a ^ 0ut ' where their paramount chief resides. Neither ecipitf tri' 36 i® numerous, and the Mawahib are very few. and* 1^!^ 0 rder on the coast come the Juheinah, a Tihamah tribe veil' ^hich includes more settled and half-settled elements, and therefore rt# ' s own mo re subservience to Ottoman authority than most than 1 ' *Ju Z Its cilief lives inland ' nea r Yambo'. As in the case ture^ ' the ri S hts of the Juheinah extend up to the Hejaz G 2100 HEJAZ Railway, but are often violated by their perpetual enemies, the Harb and the Fuqara (Fejr). . . The Harb, the first to be encountered of the greater western tribes, hold the whole centre of Hejaz, and a subsection, the Zobeid, not only occupies the central coast from Yambo to Serum below Jiddah, but reappears in strength farther south below Lith. The main body lies right across the province from the Yambo'-Jiddah littoral to the eastern Medina—Mecca road, and extends beyond Hejaz into North-Central Arabia, one of its sections, the Beni 'Amr, being m the main non-Hejazi though it owns the date-groves of Fur . As a whole the Harb count for more in Hejaz than all other tribes put ^The other great tribe of the central west, the Ateibah, normally foes of the Harb, hardly enters into our present consideration since their proper ( I ' itu lies almost wholly east of the Kheibar—Mecca—Ta if line ; but one of their main sections, the Ruqah, cannot be left altogether out of account since it not only supplies part of the population of Ta'if, but is attached politically to the Shenf of Mecca. So also, though less closely, is the other section, the ' R ptyi n In and about Mecca itself are found fourteen out of the twenty-one small Ashraf clans, which trace descent from Hasan, the Prophets grandson. Two of these, the Dhawi Surur and Shenabrah, are nomadic, ranging south of Mecca, while two more, the Dham and Dhawi Barakat, are now regular tribes, located outside Hejaz in NW. Asir. „ , , South of the Harb limit Hejaz is parcelled out among several minor tribes, of which the Juhadlah, who occupy the coast trom Serum to near Lith, are by a good deal the most important, ineir centre is Sa'diyah, about a day's march inland, and they range north almost up to the Jiddah-Mecca road and east nearly to Jebel Mora, Inland of them lie, first a very small nomad tribe, the Bern Faham, then the Hudheil on and about the Mecca-Ta'if road, and to the south of them the Beni Thaqif in and south of Ta'if itself. -Below these last again, toward the Asir boundary, range the Beni JNasri, Beni Sa'd, and Beni Malik (roughly in that order from east to west), with the small Al Mahdi tribe of fishermen dividing all from Lith, and from the northernmost of the Asiri-Tihamah tribes (Dhawi Hasan and Zobeid^Harb).if* TRADE AND INDUSTRIES 101 SOCIAL A. Trade and Industries The trade of Hejaz is created mainly by the needs of the Pil grimage, and, apart from the export of dates from some of the oases, consists almost entirely of imports. Mecca, the capital of Hejaz, has few natural advantages. From the first the town must have owed its importance to its position as a commercial centre of exchange, and to its possession of the most holy temple, stones, and well of heathen sanctity, which were afterwards incorporated in the Mohammedan cult. Its barren soil is unproductive, and it possesses no local industries whatever ; but goods are imported from all parts of the Orient. In its bazaars may be seen silks from Syria, carpets from Turkey and Persia, brass-work from India and Egypt, for which the pilgrims pay heavy prices compared with more accessible places. Traders from all parts of Islam bring their wares to Mecca and do profitable business. Jiddah, as the port of Mecca, is the trade-centre of Hejaz, and has become in consequence the most considerable place on the coast of the Red Sea. In normal times it maintains a regular volume of commerce, not only with other Arabian ports and with the Persian Gulf, but also with India, Egypt, and Africa, and, for certain classes of commodities, with Great Britain and Southern Europe. The great majority of the Mecca pilgrims arrive there by sea, and their transport and the supply of their wants constitute the chief business of the place. Many of its merchants, including a few Christians and Jews, are enterprising and wealthy. In addition to the supply of the pilgrims, Jiddah also imports for the settled population of Hejaz, and for much of West-Central Arabia, though Medina now obtains a certain amount of goods by the Hejaz Railway. In s Pite of its lack of facilities for the loading and unloading of « J cargo, Jiddah is in normal times a regular place of call, twice monthly, for the British India Steamship Company's vessels j and m es? a 111:611011 llne of steamers and the vessels of the Austrian Lloyd Jl t0Uch tliere at irre g ular intervals. It is also visited by vessels •i ti n tile 0ceanic Steamship Company, the Khedivial Mail Steamship Company, three British Indian steamship companies, the Turkish Mahsusah Transport Company, and by those of three Dutch com panies. Of sailing vessels trading with the port those of Turkish ownership greatly preponderate. From March 1910 to March 1911 (the latest figures available) the number of vessels entering the102 HEJAZ port of Jiddah was 1,055, representing an aggregate of 656,632 tons. In 1910 the goods exported from Jiddah were valued at over £65,000, but in each of the two preceding years they were nearer £50,000 ; they consisted chiefly of sheep-skins, goat-skins, cow hides, camel-hides, wool, henna, gum, mother-of-pearl shells, &amp;c. The great export is specie, amounting, it appears, to considerably over £1,000,000 a year. No regular stock of coal is maintained, and not more than a hundred and fifty tons of Welsh coal can be relied on at any time. _ i 11 As in the case of exports, no official statistics are obtainable on the imports of Jiddah, and hardly any information from local merchants. In 1910 it seems certain that about £90,000 was paid as import duties, which would give a little less than £1,000,000 worth (invoice value) of dutiable imports. To this total must be added goods imported from Ottoman ports, on which no duty is levied. According to one estimate the total yearly imports have been placed as high as £1,750,000 ; as exports are trifling in amount, the goods imported are for the most part paid for by the money of the pilgrims. „ Imports consist chiefly of grain, piece-goods, coffee, tea, sugar, flour, tobacco, spices, timber, carpets, crockery, and hardware. Under normal conditions the principal imports from the British Empire are rice and cereals from India, piece-goods from the United Kingdom (direct, or via Constantinople, Syria, or India), hardware and metals from India and the United Kingdom. Flour is nearly all from British India, though a little of superior quality is imported from Marseilles and Russia. Rice is from British India, but of wheat only a small proportion is Indian ; nearly all is from Basra, the freights being light, whereas freights from Egypt are found prohibitive. After the outbreak of war with Turkey, in November 1914, grain and foodstuffs (including from Egypt) continued to be imported, in accordance with the policy of the British Government, which intended them for the support of the pil grims and the Arab population of thtf Hejaz. The action of the Turkish authorities in seizing this grain for the use of their troops led for a time to the stoppage of supplies. But, owing to the distress among the civil population in the Hejaz, the British govern ment has since permitted the importation of grain and foodstuns to be resumed until May 1916, when all sea-trade was once more stopped, only to be again permitted after the revolt in June. ( A share of the trade with Central Arabia is absorbed by Yam bo, the natural port for Medina and Nejd, and, although its commerce,r4 TRADE AND INDUSTRIES 103 is of small importance compared with that of Jiddah, the harbour is normally visited by Egyptian, British, Turkish, and Austriansteamers. The revenue of the port is derived exclusively from the customs, the duties being nominally fixed at 10 per cent. ; the imports are mostly grain, coffee, and articles of clothing. The other places on the coast of Hejaz are of no commercial importance, and, with one exception, are not ports of call for steamers; at Lith, in Southern Hejaz, an Austrian Lloyd steamer used to call at intervals of about three months on her passage from Loheia and Qunfudah. Apart from its indispensable trade in provisions, Medina has never acquired the commercial importance that Mecca owes to the Hajj. Eor the Pilgrimage to Medina is not compulsory, and only a small proportion of the Meccan pilgrims prolong their visit so as to include the Prophet's tomb, though visitors may come there at any time of the year. The town-population of Medina resembles that of Mecca in subsisting entirely on the Pilgrimage and the Turkish subsidy; but the town also possesses a large agricultural population (see p. 117), and is a considerable source of local supply. The staple produce of Medina, as of all the oases of Hejaz, is the date. Of the numerous varieties grown there, the best class of date (shelebi) is packed in skins and boxes, and exported to all parts of the Mohammedan world. The helw date of El-'Ala, soft and tasting like honey, is also famous outside the limits of Hejaz ; it, too, is stored in skins, where it begins to dry and crystallize, and is exported in that form. A considerable proportion of the crop is carried to Syria, in part by the Syrian Hajj; the honey-date of El-'Ala is a favourite sweetmeat in Damascus. El-'Ala and the other oases are also great sources of date-supply to the Bedouins, and they main tain some traffic with them in corn and imported rice. The chief traffic of Kheibar and Henakiyah is with Medina, merchants bringing their goods to the former oasis regularly for the autumn fair. The commercial connexions of Teima, on the other hand, run eastward, tradesmen from Jebel Shammar arriving there with Baghdad cloth ing and the light and cheaper Gulf calico ; coffee-pestles and mortars of limestone marble are also imported from Jauf. The only export of the oases, apart from dates and the small trade in cereals, is Teima rock-salt, which is used in all parts of Arabia ; it is said to be preferred to the sea-salt from Wejh and other coastal sources of supply. B. Life 1. Town life in Hejaz cannot be summarized usefully under any series of generalization, the majority of the urban centres being104 HEJAZ either cosmopolitan centres like Mecca and Medina, whose societies are not typical of local urban life, or ports like Jiddah and Yambo', of mixed population, and, like the inland centres, varying greatly from month to month according to the ebb and flow of passing pilgrims. Ta'if, again, as an official summer resort, stands by itself. Urban life, therefore, will be best treated of under each separate town. 2. Bedouin life has certain common features which distinguish it to some extent from that of the nomadic societies elsewhere in Arabia. While, on the one hand, nomadism is paramount throughout Hejaz outside the towns, there being very few and inconsiderable villages or even hamlets, the towns, on the other hand, owing to their external relations, remain more independent of it than in any other area where it prevails to anything like the same degree. The result is that the sharpest contrast exists between urban and rural life in Hejaz. The townsmen are among the best off, the Bedouins among the worst off, in Arabia. Thanks to their detachment from the settled communities and to the poverty of the soil, the Hejazi Bedouins are exceptionally unproductive and uncommercial; and further, owing to the temptation offered by the pilgrim traffic, and also to the check imposed upon their natural free development by the local pressure of the condominium of the Porte and the Sherif, they are of exceptionally predatory character, low morale, and disunited organization. Though there are very large tribes, such as the Harb and Ateibah, there are practically no great Bedouin chiefs in Hejaz : and the tribes act less as units than almost anywhere else. In short, while the nomads are individually less to be trusted in Hejaz than in any other Arabian province, the engage ments made for groups and safe-conducts given in all sincerity by their Sheikhs will have less validity in every respect, and very limited local range. 3. Oasis life in Hejaz is that of simple and primitive agricul turists. The clay-built houses are often spacious, with an upper floor, and the windows are open casements for light and air. The flooring is of beaten earth, the doors rudely constructed of palm-boards. Bafters are made of tamarisk and palm-beams, for in all the oases tamarisk is grown for timber. Palmwood is used for cooking, but charcoal in the Nejd manner for the coffee-fires, the men making it in the desert. Camel harness is manu factured from palm-fibre ; but the villagers are chiefly occupied with the tending of their palm-groves and with cultivation. The Hejazis are barren of invention and initiative. Water is their mam concern, but they continue to use old wells and rarely sink newSS- LIFE 105 ones. In most of the oases there is a trade in mutton, goat flesh, and daily provisions ; but there are few bazaars, for every one is a merchant of his own produce in his own house. C. Currency At Mecca, Medina, and the ports, and to some extent along the Hajj road, Turkish coinage is current, for the or subsidy, is paid by the Turkish Government to the Sheikhs in Turkish meji- diehs. But the Government prohibition of the use of foreign money is obeyed only in transactions with Government departments ; hence the currency is confused and complicated. Very various coins circulate in the ports; and at Jiddah, and in a minor degree at Yambo', money-changers ply a lucrative trade. In the ports and towns rupees and dollars (both ' brum '.and Maria Theresa ; see below) are the coins perhaps most in circulation. The Turkish silver mejidieh and gold lira are in considerable circulation, especially for official purposes ; but the Turkish silver piastre is not much in use, being mostly replaced by the Indian 2-anna piece. The following tables give the silver and gold currency of Jiddah : Silver The silver currency for ordinary transactions begins from the lowest coin, the devani, which is an imaginary or ' account ' coin, or at any rate is now never seen. 28 devanis = 1 rezin (also imaginary). 40 devanis = 1 bad piastre (also imaginary). 28 bad piastres = 1 Umla dollar (also imaginary). 40 rezins = 1 Umla dollar (also imaginary). The imaginary Umla dollar is the standard most used in trans actions with Arabs of the interior. 20 to 21J bad piastres = 1 rupee. 322 to 324 bad piastres = 1 £ st. 1 Ottoman silver piastre (real coin) = 2d. (about). 20 Ottoman silver piastres (real coin) = 1 mejidieh. 120 to 122 Ottoman silver piastres (real coin) = 1 £ st. 110 Ottoman Government account piastres, called ' gold ' (imagi nary coin) = 1 £ st. Dollars, called ' brum are of three kinds, viz. : Singapore \ Javanese (• = each from 30 to 36 bad piastres. Mexican J106 HEJAZ Maria Theresa or Franca dollar = 30 to 36 bad piastres. Javanese or Dutch dollar = 64 bad piastres. Egyptian dollar of 20 Egyptian piastres = 64 to 66 bad piastres. Tunis dollar (5fr.) = 60 to 64 bad piastres. JPersian kran = 10^ bad piastres. Rupees at the above-mentioned rate (15 rs. per 1 £ st., fixed rate) are in wide and constant circulation. Gold The exchange for British gold has been already given ; the follow ing table gives that for the Turkish lira, the Napoleon, and the Russian 10-rouble piece : Turkish lira = 290 to 294 bad piastres. Napoleon = 250 to 255J ,, ,, Russian 10-rouble piece = 329 to 330 ,, „ In the oases and the inland district of Hejaz the riyal, or Maria Theresa dollar, is the common standard of value for houses, land, produce, camels, and live-stock generally; but little silver is in actual circulation. At Teima the silver riyals, received by the village dealers from the sale of dates or grain to nomads (who in their turn had parted with camels to brokers), are nearly all exhausted for the annual tribute, certain sheikhs riding with them to Ha'il, after the date harvest, to pay them into the treasury of the Emir. Elsewhere the stock of silver does not accumulate, but soon finds its way to the coast, to Nejd, or to Syria, in payment for goods imported. Conse- quently for the traffic of daily life very little money passes, though values and payments are generally reckoned on a silver basis. But this causes little inconvenience, for much of Arabian traffic is tradi tionally barter. ^ . When, for example, land is sold, a part payment is made ot such scanty silver as the purchaser possesses, and the rest is delivered in the form of dates and household gear, such as brass pots and vessels, which, with the exception of the rare sitting carpet, are nearly the only movables in the simple dwellings. Doughty reports a sale of an outlying plot of land at Kheibar, for which the principal consideration was an old cutlass and its scabbard. The hire for camels is paid in dates; at Teima, for example, a month s hire of a good camel is a hundred measures of dates, the equivalent of five riyals. Dates, in fact, form the commonest and most convenient medium of exchange in the oases.WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 107 D. Weights and Measures In Mecca, Medina, and their ports, Turkish weights and measures are largely employed, but not to the exclusion of native standards. At Medina and in all the oases of Hejaz the measure most commonly employed is the sah (sd'), which varies considerably in content in different places. According to Doughty the sah is the equivalent of nearly two pints at Teima, nearly three pints at El-'Ala, and five pints at Kheibar; at Ha'il he reports it is two pints and a half. The other measures in use, as given by Doughty, are the following : A medega (a small palm-basket), the equivalent of twelve sahs ; and a mejellad, the equivalent of five medegas. At Medina and elsewhere in Hejaz a skin of dates is called hashlyah. Large bargains in dates are reckoned in camel-loads. The measure of length in Hejaz, as in other parts of Arabia, appears to be the actual cubit, the distance from a man's elbow to the point of his middle finger According to Doughty a ' palm-rod' (length not stated) is employed at Kheibar as a larger lineal measure, the repair of an orchard-wall being reckoned and paid for by the palm-rod. POLITICAL 1. Government Under the Ottoman arrangement Hejaz became a vilayet, whose vali was resident at Mecca in winter and Ta'if in summer (except when the Pilgrimage fell in the summer months). His governorship included all the area from the border of the vilayet of Sham (Damas cus), S. of Ma'an (but latterly from El-'Ala only), down to the northern limit of the vilayet of Yemen, S. of Lith. Under him were four kazas, Yambo', Rabugh, Jiddah, and Lith. In these the apparatus of government was organized on the usual Ottoman system, the officials of the Porte collecting all taxes (so far as taxes could be collected at all in such a province as Hejaz). The towns of Mecca and Medina, however, were not only tax- free so far as the Ottoman Government was concerned, but in receipt of subsidies from the Treasury ; and so also were many nomad chiefs, notably certain Harb sheikhs, capable of inter fering with the passage of pilgrims or with the railway track. The whole province was exempt from military service, and an attempt to prevail upon the Hejazis to accept conscription in 1914 was resisted successfully by the Emir of Mecca.108 HEJAZ The Porte, however, maintained its own forces in Hejaz under the exclusive command of its own officers. The normal garrison, including the Emir's own guard of 500 men, was about 7,000 with 3 batteries, of which force a large part was usually stationed along the Hejaz Railway line, the proper garrisons of Mecca, Medina, Jiddah, Yambo', and Ta'if being kept much below strength. The result was that only the chief centres of settled population and the Hejaz Railway line were effectively and continuously held. Other lines of communication were all precarious. The road from Medina to Yambo', for example, required a strong escort, and the pilgrim tracks from Medina to Mecca were more often closed by the Harb than open, payments of surra notwithstanding. The direct road from Mecca to Ta'if by 'Arafat was notoriously unsafe, and even on the Jiddah road, in the intervals between block-houses, murders and highway robberies were of common occurrence. Side by side, however, with this foreign government there has existed the very real, though mediatized, authority of the Emir (or ' Grand Sherif') of Mecca. This Emirate, whose institution— one of the results of the decline of the early Caliphial regime in the Moslem world—dates from the tenth century, was, until the last years of the eighteenth century, the sole power in Hejaz, having in that century cast off all but a shadow of dependence on the Porte, which kept a precarious hold on Jiddah alone. The Wahabite invasion, however, followed by the imposition of Egyptian rule upon Hejaz, brought about a change. Mohammed 'Ali of Egypt reduced the E m ir to a cipher, and when the Porte resumed direct control of Hejaz, in 1840, its firmer hand and the internecine dissensions of the Sherifial clans and families in Mecca prevented the Emirate from recovering its eighteenth-century position. It did, however, gradually improve its status, having retained the loyalty of the Bedouins of West-Central Arabia. The Emir's allowance was increased by the Porte to a princely income, with which, and with private means largely derived from lands in Egypt and Mesopotamia, he maintained a large household and a strong body-guard. He was recognized as the chief executive* officer in Mecca itself, and as enjoying an extra-territorial indepen dence there and at Ta'if, with the right to keep official represen tatives to watch his own and Meccan interests at Jiddah, Medina, and elsewhere. In spite of the strengthening of Ottoman power in Hejaz by 'Othman Pasha in 1886, the astute Emir, 'Aun er-Rafiq, kept and increased his privileged position, the relation between Vali and Emir being not unhke that between a Resident and a Raj ah in a mediatized native state of India. Although the Porte could not, theGOVERNMENT 109 Emir could, call out considerable levies of Hejazi and other Bedouins, and by so doing in order to fight the Turks' battles, Emirs, and par ticularly the actual prince, Husein, have not only made interest with the Porte, but inspired it with a wholesome respect, and, further, kept in touch with a fighting force which could be used some day for their own ends. This position of the Emir of Mecca as a great Bedouin chief was bound to increase with the decline of Ottoman strength ; and it is by using it that Sherif Husein, the present prince, has almost restored the Emirate to the power and independence it enjoyed before the Wahabite invasion. The Emirate has never been, in theory, hereditary or restricted, except by prescription, to any one Sherifial clan or family. As a matter of fact, the Emirs for a century past, including the present prince, who was sent from Constantinople to take the office in 1908, have owed their succession to direct nomination by the foreign occupying power. But the Porte has kept to the 'Abadilah house since 1827, twice only interpolating a member of the rival Dhawi Zeid for short terms (1851-6 and 1880-2) on the impera principle. It has always been a disadvantage of the Emirs that members not only of other Ashraf clans, but also of their own houses, hold themselves as well or better entitled to the Emirate ; and if the Turkish power were to be withdrawn, the internecine wars which marked each avoidance of the throne up to the close of the eighteenth century would no doubt revive. The actual Emir could only secure the succession to a son by maintaining and leaving to him a superior paid force of soldiery, and one son would be as likely to claim the succession as another It is well to bear in mind that in Mecca itself is always centred a strong opposition to the ruling house, and an Emir can hardly fail to have foes of his own household. The title ' Grand Sherif' is a European invention. The Arabs call the prince of Mecca Emir, and address him as ' Seyyidna ' (our Lord). From the Turks he had the titles £ Highness ' and ' Pasha ', his sons being commonly styled ' Beys '. 2. Recent History and Politics The ruling Emir, Sherif Husein ibn 'Ali, grandson of the first 'Abadilah Emir (died in 1858), is now well over sixty years of age. He was nominated to the Emirate by the Anglophil Grand Vizier, Kiamil Pasha, in 1908, after a long residence at Constantinople. Sherif Husein's uncle, 'Abdillah, had died on the way to take up the position to which he had been nominated at Mecca, and Husein's cousin, 'Ali, who was Emir previously, had been banished with his110 HEJAZ family to Egypt. His other cousins, the children of Ann er-Rafiq, Emir from 1882 to 1905, were also interdicted by the Porte. Husein was appointed as a man of pacific character, likely both to serve the Porte's purposes and also to keep on good terms with ourselves. In the early years of his Emirate he appeared zealously to be fulfilling the first hope. In 1910 he took up arms for the Turks against the Asiri revolt under Idrisi and succeeded in relieving Ibha and seriously reducing Idrisi's power. In the same year he sent an expedition to Qasim to assert the rights of the Ateibah; and though, through the defection of Ibn Rashid, he had to retire content with an arrangement with Ibn Sa'ud (under this the Ateibah were to remain free of the latter's taxes and the Meccan Treasury merely asserted its right to a considerable contribution from Qasim), his influence had been extended to Central Arabia. Shortly afterwards he took under his protection certain fugitive rebels of Ibn Sa'ud's house, for sheltering whom the Ateibah had been raided. His relations with Ibn Sa'ud have continued, however, outwardly peaceful, and those with Ibn Rashid friendly. Husein, however, had cherished from the first, under the stimulus of his powerful second son, 'Abdullah, the design of emanci pating the Meccan Emirate from its dependence on the Porte: and, though he himself does not seem at any time to have desired the Caliphate, 'Abdullah, his reputed successor-designate, has been credited with that ambition. His early pro-Ottoman expeditions had served to organize a Bedouin force which he could use at need. From 1913 Sherif Husein began to follow an anti-Ottoman policy, opposing the extension of the Hejaz Railway and supporting the Harb tribesmen in their resistance to both this and other Turkish projects. Prom the outbreak of the present war he has steadily refused to help the Turks to recruit in Hejaz, and though, for fear of having to submit to crippling requisitions, he gave way so far as to allow his eldest son, 'Ali, to raise an irregular regiment of Bedouins at Medina for service in Sinai, he continued to organize the Hejaz tribes, which acknowledge his authority, with a view to insurrec tion at the proper moment ; and, reconciling himself with Idrisi, tried to unite him and the Imam of Yemen in a common anti- Ottoman aim. His third son, Peisal, was dispatched to Constan tinople early in 1915, and, on his return to Syria, got into com munication with the pan-Arabists. Though Peisal's policy and actions have not been quite clear, it seems that he secretly furthered his father's designs by promoting disaffection ; and though obliged to accompany Enver to Medina in February 1916, he returned to Syria to continue the same work. In 1915 'Abdullah, the secondRECENT HISTORY AND POLITICS 111 ■Ral son, was sent to Central Arabia to make peace between the Emirs of Ha'il and Riyadh and to enforce the claims of the Mecean pl Treasury on Qasim and Sedeir. This peace was, however, not 18 observed on either side for long. ah® By the spring of 1916 Husein had become the power in fori Hejaz, with wide influence outside, extending in Asir to Wadi ifei Bishah, and northward to the southern Anazah tribes. Both in m\ Mecca and Medina (in which last city he kept his eldest son, 'Ali, SeiW; as his representative) he had reduced Turkish authority very low, Dretii and even in Jiddah his agents wielded the most influence. But lis i the Porte was maintaining its garrisons, in spite of temporary inter- Mectt ruptions of railway communication, and, under their protection, mfffl the Ottoman officials held on. In May 1916 a strict naval patrol M of the Hejaz coasts was enforced by us, in order to support the Emir ibelst by demonstrating to the Arabs the inevitable results of further rai. submission to Ottoman occupations ; and, early in June, an insur- wai rection of tribes from the Juheinah in the north to the borders of Asir in the eouth, including both Harb and Ateibah, broke out er 1 under the leadership of the Emir and his sons, imai Je/J DISTRICTS AND TOWNS A.

The only settlements of even village rank are : rned 1 . i ; Akaba lies on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Akaba, near tid 1 a ' which forms a circular bay extending for some three miles112 HEJAZ to the N. and NW. The shore is very low at the head of the bay, where the Wadi Arabah debouches, a sandy valley bounded on each side by high escarpments. Akaba consists of a small square fort, a Turkish telegraph-office, and a village of about 50 houses, with adjoining gardens and date-grove ; no fishing boats. The climate is unhealthy on account of the absence of west winds ; much fever. The general well (water brackish and not good) is close to the shore, a few yards W. of the fort; no water inside village. A Turkish garrison is normally stationed here, consisting of fifty infantry under two officers, ten camel police, and twenty unmounted police, the last raised from natives of the district. The fort also forms a grain-depot for the use of caravans on their way to and from Mecca. Close to the W. of the fort a primitive pier has been constructed. 2, Muweilah, a village and fort about 150 miles S., containing a small grain-depot for pilgrims and a Bedouin market. The village consists of some seventy or eighty families, most of them dwelling in palm-leaf huts ; there are a few stone houses, and some gardens and date-groves. The water-supply is from shallow wells, and is abundant but not always good. Sheep are obtainable, and charcoal is extensively burnt from acacia-trees in the neighbourhood. A small Turkish garrison holds the place. The coast is low, but gradually rises inland to hills of great height. There is no harbour, but merely a roadstead behind coral reefs, where a vessel might anchor in light winds ; but the approaches are dangerous. Good shelter may be obtained at Sherm Yuhar, an inlet about 4 miles S. There is a cara van-route from Muweilah to Tebuk (Route No. 30), and so to Medina. 3. Dhaba. S. of Muweilah, the head-quarters of the local Huweitat chief, is a hamlet chosen by the Turks as the base of their coastal defences. It has wells and groves (see Route No. 34). Others, such as another Dhaba, half-way down the shore of the Akaba Gulf, and Salmah, south of Muweilah, are mere blockhouses near which Bedouins occasionally camp. The description of the Egyptian pilgrim road (Route No. 34) will give a sufficient general idea of the Midianite Tihamah, Behind the coastal plain on the Gulf of Akaba the land rises steeply to moderate heights ; but near the opening of the Red Sea it springs up in a series of granitic peaks, from 7,000 to 9,000 ft. in height, behind which, at an elevation of about 6,000 ft., the main sandstone plateau of the Arabian shelf presents a continuous escarpment to the W. at an average distance of forty miles inland. The valleys descending from this escarpment between the coastal peaks, and also from the peaks themselves,, are all sand-DISTRICTS AND TOWNS 113 choked fiumaras, with none but very scanty desert vegetation. The plateau behind the escarpment is a vast plain of red sand with isolated outcrops of rock and is known generally as Hisma. It is about 50 miles broad and on the S. and E. is enclosed by rugged barren ground capped with lavas whose level is about 1,500 ft. higher than the western plain. When this ridge is passed, there is a steep fall eastward to the sandy steppe of West-Central Arabia through which the Hejaz Railway is laid at a distance of about 100 miles from the Midian coast. Route No. 30, from Muweilah to Tebuk (q.v.), passes through country typical of Midian. The littoral as far S. as Wadi Hamdh was regarded as Egyptian territory under Ottoman suzerainty until 1886. B. Wadi Hamdh Under this name may be included for convenience all northern Hejaz from N. lat. 27° to N. lat. 24°, because throughout all that long stretch of nearly 200 miles the hinterland drains ultimately to the Red Sea through the single channel of Wadi Hamdh, which debouches about 30 miles south of Wejh. The country between the coast-line and the Hejaz Railway (here laid about 150 miles inland), is very ill known to us, and the Wadi Hamdh itself has never been followed by any explorer. It can only be said that the coastal plain and range of Midian are continued throughout, the former becoming if anything more barren, and the latter declining in elevation, but remaining abrupt and rising again to great height in Jebel Radhwah, north of Yambo'. Wadi Hamdh itself cuts through this coastal range, coming from the 'Aweiridh harrdh on the one hand and the Kheibar harrah on the other (see p. 97). If we may judge by the experience of travellers on the two main caravan tracks which cross this district, that from Wejh to El-'Ala and that from Yambo' to Medina, the coastal range is backed by a rougher but less elevated tract than in Midian, and this contains some scattered hamlets of the Billi tribe in the upper range of the Juheinah towards the south. The chief pilgrim-route from Mecca to Medina crosses the south-eastern angle of the district diagonally, and has caused more permanent hamlets to exist there than elsewhere ; but there is practically nothing worthy to be called a village between the Tihamah and the Hejaz Railway, or between El-'Ala and Medina. For the coast of the Tihamah see Route No. 34. The principal, and about the only permanent, settlements in it are the following : 4. Wejh, a small town, including a few stone houses, on the N. arabia i tt114 HEJAZ side of the bay of the same name; population about 2,000. A hun dred yards E. of the town is a fort on a flat-topped hill. The bazaar is poorly stocked, but some forage is procurable. Water is scarce and brackish; the main supply is obtained from a well some 30 ft. deep, about 1,000 yards to the E. of the fort. The coast intheneigh- bourhood consists of coral cliffs from 50 to 70 ft. high, and between these and the hills, which rise steeply 3 or 4 miles inland, is a low plain, marshy near the sea and covered with a saline encrustation. The harbour is easy of access and no dangers bar its approach ; it is rectangular in shape, 3 cables long, and has an entrance 250 yards wide between reefs. The fort makes a good mark for a ship entering the harbour, as does also a tower, 50 ft. high, on the S. side of the bay. The best anchorage is in 6 fathoms about a cable SE. by S. of the southern end of the village, though there is not room for more than one vessel of moderate size. About 6 miles E. of Wejh is a fort, nearly surrounded by hills, with a small Turkish garrison; it serves as a grain-depot for the use of caravans going to Mecca. 5. Umlejh (Ummlaj), a village of some 80 houses with fort and small garrison on a deep bay, opening to NNW. opposite Hasani Island. It has a considerable but thin date-grove in the wadi about 1 mile N. Umlejh has grown from a mere hamlet in the last few years, owing to the facilities of its bay for coasting craft, the existence of a fairly easy track to Istabal 'Antar station on the Hejaz Railway (120 miles) or to Medina direct (140 miles), and the comparative fertihty of the Tihamah hereabouts and in the lower course of Wadi Ain, north of Jebel Radhwah. It lies near, but S. of, the frontier between Billi and Juheinah territories. Although faced by a dangerous reef, the harbour is the most favourable for steam craft on the N. half of the Red Sea coast, and should develop in the near future. 6. Yambo' el-Bahr is a garrisoned town, built on the edge of the barren plain between the mountains and the sea, and walled on the landward side. It stands on the N. shore of a bay, pro tected by a small sandy island on a reef which forms the southern limit of the anchorage. It has no made harbour, but is used as the port of Medina (130 miles). The entrance to the inlet is 1| cables wide between the reefs. The water is deep outside, but in the entrance the depths decrease rapidly from 15 to 8 and 6 fathoms; off the town the anchorage is in from 4 to 6 fathoms, and the width available is 1J cables. The houses of the town are roughly built oi limestone and coralline, and the crumbling of the latter gives them a dilapidated appearance. It is a mean and very dirty place, but there are some good shops where most necessaries are obtain able, The permanent population is about 3,000 ; but caravans,DISTRICTS AND TOWNS 115 especially in the Pilgrimage season, double or treble it temporarily. Pilgrims who arrive by sea store here their goods which are too heavy to be transported. Non-Moslems are allowed to reside within the town provided they do not go outside the walls. Water is brought on camel-back from wells at Aseliyah, 3 miles E., and from others (brackish) in the town; also from rain-cisterns. It is nowhere good. A condensing plant has recently been put up. The Vali of Hejaz is here represented by a Kaimmakajn. Telegraph to Medina. The place is in Juheinah territory. Yambo'en-Nakhl is a palm-oasis and village some miles away to the ENE., head-quarters of the Juheinah Arabs. 7. El-'Ala is a large oasis-village of about 3,000 inhabitants, many of them of servile descent, on the Hejaz Railway at the N. limit of religious Hejaz. It lies on the SW. side of the Wadi el-Qura, which here runs NW. and SE. under the steep cliff of the Harrat el- 'Aweiridh. The railway follows the pilgrim route to the E. of the wadi, and the station is at a place called Monstreyah nearly 2 m. S. of the town. The town itself is narrow and about a third of a mile in length, but the oasis extends above and below it to a total length of more than three miles. It is walled on the SW. side, where it adjoins the desert, and there are two main gates besides smaller doors ; it is open on the side of the oasis. The houses are well constructed of stone, but the streets are narrow and darkened by the upper storeys, which are built high to gain some freshness in the stagnant air of the wadi, shut off as it is by the from the western sea-winds. There is no bazaar, but provisions are sold after sunrise at the street-corners, and mutton and goat-flesh outside the walls. The date plantations and fields are irrigated by a lukewarm brook and by some smaller springs which rise in the oasis. All the water is tepid and sulphurous, the temperature of the main stream being 92° E.; in it the villagers wash themselves, and there are enclosed bathing-places for the women. The women go closely veiled. Where the valley begins to shelve the fields are dug out deeply, below the level of the public paths, for direct irrigation ; the outlying palms, beyond the level of the springs, are watered from well-pits dug to a depth of 27 ft. The ground-water, which is cooler and brackish, is drawn by small humped cattle. El-'Ala is a great source of date-supply for the NW. nomads, and there is a certain amount of traffic in corn and imported rice. Of the many kinds of dates, the helw variety is chiefly exported to Syria (seep, 103). There are groves of sweet and sour lemons, but the plum is the only stone-fruit. There are not many vines, and H2116 HEJAZ these climb on trees and trellises. Besides the humped cattle employed for field labour, there are a few asses and goats and some poultry. . , • ion -i • i j 8. Medina is a walled town in a large oasis, 130 miles inland from Yambo', and is the present terminus of the Hejaz Railway. It lies in a hollow of an elevated plain, at an altitude of 2,300 ft. Hills surround the plain on three sides, at a distance of 5 to 10 miles from the town, but the country is more open towards the S. The convergence of wadis in the neighbourhood of Medina has made it one of the best-watered districts in Hejaz. The city, which is about half the size of Mecca, forms an irregular oval and is about a mile in length. It consists of two parts. The older town, in the NE. quarter, is surrounded by its own wall, and is separated by a broad open space, the Barr el-Munakhah, and on the S. side by the narrower Darb el-Jenazah, from the modern town and suburbs, which are protected by a rampart of mud and crude brick joining the wall of the older town at its NW. and SE. extremities. Through the modern town runs the Wadi Buthan, a tributary of the Wadi Qanat, which the road from Yambo crosses. A fort or small citadel shuts in the head of the Barr el-Munakhan on the N. side. There are five outer gates, the Bab esh-Shami and the Bab ez-Ziyafah on the N., the former leading to Jebel Ohod and the tomb and mosque of the Prophet's uncle Hamzah (about 4 miles from the town) ; in the E. wall is the Bab el-Jumah, which opens on the Nejd road, and Baqi' el-Gharqad, the cemetery in which are the tombs of many of the companions of the Prophet; on the S. is the Bab Kubah, opening on to the Kubah road, and on the W. is the Bab el-'Ambari,through which runs the road to Yambo . The E. and W. gates are massive buildings with double towers. The railway station lies about a quarter of a mile to the W. of the town, and includes some substantial, bullet-proof buildings. Pilgrims arriving by rail or from Yambo' enter the town by tne W. gate and cross the suburbs to the Barr el-Munakhah, the great open space, already referred to, where caravans assemble on arrival and before starting ; here those who cannot afford to hire houses encamp in the open. The older town is entered from the J3arr el-Munakhah by the Bab el-Misr, from which the principal street runs eastward to the Haram or Prophet's Mosque, which is entered at the principal gate (Bab es-Salam) in the SW. corner, richly decorated with marbles, tiles, and gilded inscriptions ; but tne spacious court of the mosque, with its minarets and lofty dome, is hemmed in on all sides by narrow lanes and houses. ^vVitliin the principal gate a portico leads along the S. wall to the chamber.DISTRICTS AND TOWNS 117 hung with curtains, which is supposed to contain the graves of Mohammed, Abu Bekr, and 'Omar; the reputed tomb of Fatimah is in a chamber to the N. of this. Within the court of the mosque are the Prophet's well, and some palms said to have been planted by Fatimah. The houses of the town are substantially built of granite and lava blocks cemented with lime ; some of those in the better residential quarters are four or five storeys high and have small gardens behind them. The streets are narrow and dark, but clean, and in part paved. Unlike Mecca, Medina has always been a city of agriculturists. It is surrounded on all sides except the W. by date plantations and cultivated fields, which extend for several miles. A copious supply of water is conducted from a tepid source (Ez-Zarkah) at the village of Kubah (2 miles to the S.), and is distributed by underground conduits to each quarter. Good water is also obtained from many wells in the oasis, the underground water being within easy reach at almost any point. Some of the wells are brackish, and the soil in places is impregnated with salt. The date-palm grows luxuriantly; no less than 139 varieties are said to be cultivated, of which 60 or 70 are well known. The best class is exported (see above, p. 103). Vines also flourish, the best variety having a long white grape ; the fruit-trees include jujube-trees, bananas, limes, some peach-trees, three sorts of pomegranates, but no apricots. Maize is largely grown, smaller quantities of wheat and barley, some Egyptian clover (berslm), and a large assortment of vegetables. The permanent population, apart from the garrison, is about 40,000, living mainly on the Pilgrimage, on the revenues of the mosque, and on a large Government grant The suburban population, composed mainly of landowners and cultivators, profess Shiah opinions more or less openly and tend to marry among themselves. In this respect they form a contrast to the motley population of the city, which through intermarriage with Turks, Kurds, Persians, and other races is Arab only in language and customs. Further admixture takes place through new settlers, who remain behind after each Pilgrimage, attracted by the profits to be gained as guides and by the Turkish subsidy. All classes in the town, from the owners of houses to the water-carriers, make large profits out of the pilgrims, for while a visit to Medina is not com pulsory (like the Pilgrimage to Mecca), those make it who can afford the luxury (see Chapter II); thus the annual influx of pilgrims, though much below that of Mecca, is still very considerable. Normally there is a garrison of three battalions and some camelry. Telegraph to Damascus and Yambo'.118 HEJAZ 9. Teirna is a small oasis-town just outside the south-western corner of the Nefud, on the northern border of Hejaz, about 65 miles N. of El-'Ala. It lies in a depression in the high open plain, at an altitude of 3,400 ft., on a flood-bottom of fertile loam surrounded by a sterile waste of undulating ground. The oasis consists of three -separate divisions, the principal settlement lying in the centre and known as El-Haddaj, from the famous well in the midst of its island of date-palms. The oasis is surrounded by clay orchard- walls, which are in a very dilapidated state and do not form any sort of protection. It is fortified by high towers of sun-dried brick, and similar towers are built in the separate quarters of the town; these date from the insecure times before the government of Ibn Rashid. Two smaller oases lie to the SE. and NW. respectively; they form separate enclosures and are watered by their own wells. Between that to the NW. and the main oasis is Qasr Zellum, a square fort-like building, with walls of dry masonry 5 ft. thick, 15 ft. high, and measuring some 50 to 60 paces in length. The walls of the old Jewish city lie to the SW., some 50 ft. above the town, where they form a circuit of 3 miles ; and between them and the oasis are remains of rude stone buildings of the same period. The present town is a healthy and prosperous settlement. The clay-built houses are spacious, and most of them are provided with an upper floor and with open casements for light and air ; they are scattered through the oasis, each being surrounded by its own walled garden. The great mosque lies in the E. of the town. The water, both for drinking and irrigation, is supplied entirely by wells, and is flat, lukewarm, and unwholesome. The principal supply is obtained from El-Haddaj, the great well-pit already referred to, which is known throughout Arabia. It is a large pit, measuring some 50 ft. across and 50 ft. deep to the water-level, the sides being walled with cut stones ; the water wells strongly from a large hole in the rock and suffices for the whole central oasis. Some sixty frames with draw-wheels are mounted around it, the leather buckets being raised by well-camels ; irrigation goes on day and night, but the water-supply is never exhausted. There are, besides, several other small well-pits dotted about the oasis, worked by two or three camels each. The soil of Teima is good, and after one ploughing is fit for sowing or for the planting of date-palms. The land bears corn every year, with a variation in the kind of grain ; but the villagers sow only for one harvest, as the water is required mainly for the date plantations. They plough in the autumn with the well -camels and manure the fields from the camel-yards. Wheat, barley,DISTRICTS AND TOWNS 119 millet, and a small-grained Nejd wheat are grown, and some tobacco, green in the dried leaf. Fruit-trees, which are planted beside the irrigation channels, include the plum, pomegranate, fig, the great citron, and sweet and sour lemons ; the vine grows as a trellis - plant beside the wells, and tamarisk is cultivated for timber. The many kinds of Teima dates are of excellent quality, but all are heating and are eaten with the nomads' sour buttermilk. The settled population of Teima probably numbers from 1,500 to 2,000, mainly of the Wuld Suleiman; in figure and facial lineaments they closely resemble the Bedouins. There are a few villagers of half-negro blood, but no Gallas. The women go unveiled. Among the strangers that frequent the town are a few traders from J. Shammar, who sell Baghdad clothing and cheap calico. But there are no shops, the landowners selling their corn and dates at their own ; a 5.'j houses; the nomads are their chief customers. The villagers a oil. seldom taste flesh-meat, but game is sometimes brought in. Teima V rock-salt is used in all parts of Arabia ; it is obtained from salt-beds Ifuw to the NE. of the main oasis beyond the cultivation. And at half betitai a day s ride N. of Teima a kind of black rock-alum is dug, which lesamep is used as medicine for sick camels. tlemeiii There is little destitution and no ruined houses nor abandoned prods: fields are to be seen. In 1909 an increase in cultivation was reported ; indair: Carruthers saw new plantations of palms, and newly built walled en- led In: closures. Thanks to its high desert air Teima is entirely free from hetott fever. The only serious malady is a kind of rheumatic ophthalmia, which is rife in spring ; it is caused by chill through sleeping out at night, or through drinking after nightfall water chilled in the girbies. Teima owes allegiance at present to the Emir of Ha'il, the yearly is a las tribute being collected after the date-harvest. irater-W Kheibar is a large oasis-village (or group of villages) lying in stroEfl;' hafrah desert at an elevation of about 2,800 ft., considerably below i centol H 10 general harrdh level, which is about 6,000 ft. It lies some 70 miles aroffli' 1 ^ Medina, from which town it is controlled when not left to 'atioB-' th®. tr ibesmen of Wuld Suleiman, who own the land, or to the md -, mir of Ha'il. The settlement stands in the Wadi Zeidiyah, the xrat tt the Kheibar valleys, which lie close together in the border, cutting into the lava field to the shallow clays beneath, fit fc . /^ain village is built under a long basalt crag, which stands isolated s c or ln f }l ie va le 7 and bears the ancient citadel, El-Hisn. At the top e vilbf ^ ro * s , a ' wa M e d platform, some two hundred paces by ninety, an :. 0n s ^ e a ^? v e the village is a covered well, for its supply . J.; ln time of danger; it was protected, when Doughty saw it, by two Vkat fe S rea t pyramids of brick. The village gates are shut at night.120 HEJAZ The water, supplied by many springs which rise between the upper basalt and the underlying clays, is tepid and sulphurous, but never brackish. The soil is heavily charged with salt, which renders agriculture difficult ; but if the salt-crusts be removed for two or three seasons, the soil becomes capable of being sown, and every year it becomes sweeter. The villagers plough with a pair of small oxen, and they do not dress their fields ; they only work before noon. They irrigate with the public water once a week; and the irrigation-rights of every plot of land are inscribed in the Sheikh's register of the village, the day and the hour being noted at which the owner may draw off the public water. Each house hold has its palm-plantations and its plots for sowing. The settled population is 2,500, mainly negroes and half-breeds; the majority are of the Sudan type, but there are some Gallas among them. The Arabs avoid residence for fear of intermittent fever, but they are the owners of the land which is cultivated by the negro villagers as their permanent tenants ; and they enter the town at midsummer to gather their half of the date-harvest. The Bedouin owner must also remunerate his partner at a fixed rate for the planting of fresh palms and the repair of walls ; and, should he be unable to pay, the sum may be deducted from his share of the date-harvest. The negro tenants cannot purchase the land, the right to which is vested permanently with the tribe. But the villagers possess in their own right certain open lands which have never been planted with date-palms ; these lie towards Qasr en- Nebi, to the W. of Kheibar, and at Hurdah to the NW., where there are many wells., Millet is grown for sale to the nomads ; but there is little ready money, and the younger villagers work for their food and without wages. The Kheibar dates, which form the staple produce of the oasis, are yellow and small and have a drug-like flavour, but they are not unwholesome. The chief traffic is with Medina, and many sales men arrive from that town for the autumn fair, when they store their goods in hired houses which are left empty during the rest of the year. It is only under stress of famine, after a succession of rainless winters, that Bedouins ever seek refuge in the Kheibar valleys ; when they do so, they have the right to plant half the land of their negro partners, who willingly lend them ploughs and tools. The oasis is far from healthy. The most pestilent season, called the hamlm, is between March and April, after the corn is carried ; the valley fever is then liable to carry off an adult after a day or two's sickness. 11. HenaMyah, a settlement S. of the Kheibar near theDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 121 head of Wadi el-Hamdh. According to Doughty it was formerly in the possession of the Ruweilah tribe, but is now a negro village of some forty houses with a small guard of soldiery from Medina. The place possesses several small palm-groves, lying close together. The water-supply is from wells, from 60 to 90 ft. deep ; but some springs exist in the neighbourhood, and these have been utilized to supplement the supply by means of old conduits which have been repaired. Henakiyah lies on one of the main routes between Medina and Boreidah (see Route No. 24). The Harb tribe holds all the vicinity of Medina, and one of its sections, the Beni 'Amr, owns and cultivates the chief suburban date- palm district of Jebel Fur'. It is the Beni 'Ali sub-tribe, however, which is most to be reckoned with in and near the town itself, where it is a constant source of disorder and disaffection against the Turks. Between Medina and the coast, from Yambo' south ward, the Beni Salim occupy the country and own the few palm- oases, lying mostly south of the Medina-Yambo' road. C. Southern District This district extends from N. lat. 24° to N. lat. 20°, on or about which line Asir begins. The fourfold longitudinal division of Hejaz into zones of coastal plain (Tihamah), coastal range, upland intramontane plain, and main ridge is most clearly marked here. The coastal range, however, declines in altitude from Jebel Radhwah through Jebel Subh, and south of the pilgrim route (Darb es- Sultani) from Rabugh to Medina it becomes dusty hills not above 2,000 ft. in altitude. It springs up again into a more mountainous range (Jebel Sa'diyah) some distance south of the Jiddah-Mecca road and runs on behind Lith into the high 'Aqabah of Asir. The Tihamah in the north of the district improves in fertility and, from some distance north of Jiddah to some distance north of Rabugh, has several villages (see Routes Nos. 28 and 34) and date-groves. It then lapses to desert, to improve again near Lith. The third zone, the intramontane plain, is a dusty steppe except where crossed by main wadis from the Ridge. Of these Wadi Fatimah, which flows from north of Mecca to south of Jiddah, is the most important and encourages most fertility. There is a chain of small oases with rare farms down its course fed by the abundant springs of its tributaries, the Wadis Leimun and Seil north and north-east of Mecca (see Routes Nos. 23 and 25). The Ridge, which contains some fertile valleys for a hundred miles south of Medina, increases in aridity as Mecca is approached.122 HEJAZ North of the latter town it is largely Beyond Jebel Qora however, its conditions improve, and Ta'if is one of the most luxuriant oases in Arabia. South of this again there is thin but more or less continuous fertility in valleys—the beginning of the better conditions which distinguish the inland wadis of A sir. As far south as the Jiddah-Mecca road this district is nowadays all Harb country, this tribe having pushed the Ateibah eastward out of Wadi Fatimah and long ago got rid of the Dhafir (Dhufir) and the small Ashraf clans which used to range north and north, west of Mecca. South of the Harb frontier, however, there is no big tribe, but the country is parcelled out among the many small units enumerated on p. 100. In the Tihamah there is a group of villages in the northern part on and near the line of the Darb es-Sultani. The most considerable settlement is 12. Rabugh, a group of hamlets and extensive date-groves some miles inland at the head of Sherm Rabngh ; there are numerous wells of indifferent water. Sherm Rabugh is an inlet, about 2 miles long, affording excellent anchorage in from 8 to 12 fathoms ; it is perfectly sheltered from all winds and easy of ingress and egress to sailing-vessels during north-westerly winds. In the entrance are depths of from 18 to 20 fathoms, and immediately outside no bottom at 30 fathoms. Rabugh is the head-quarters of the Zobeid Harb. Qullydh,Qctdliimah, Khalis, and 'A sjan are all of much the same character with permanent populations of 500 or over. (See Route No. 34.) 13. Jiddah is a walled town on a well-sheltered natural har bour, almost exactly half-way down the Red Sea coast. The entrance, through three lines of reefs, is, however, difficult. It possesses quays along the sea-front and is the port of Mecca (55 miles by road, and slightly under 50 crow-fly) and Ta'if, and the main avenue of pilgrim access to Hejaz from the sea. The houses here, as at Yambo^ are largely built of coralline. There are forts at the seaward angles of the walls, and three main gates and three posterns (sea-face) ; elsewhere the wall is strengthened by smaller towers at intervals. The population is about 30,000 (not all inside the walls), and includes a sprinkling of negroes and Somalis, as well as some Indians, Greeks, and Jews; about 300 British- Indian subjects are registered, but exact numbers of all families are not recorded. Non-Moslems are not allowed to go outside the walls. The normal Turkish garrison was a battalion with two field-guns.DISTRICTS AND TOWNS 123 eW| The wells in the town are brackish ; but good water is brought s from rain-cisterns or from wells and springs 7 miles away. There , * is a water-condenser in the town which works irregularly, and its f 1 ? 0 ' condensed water, being taken from a foul part of the harbour, often has a bad smell and taste ; it can turn out about 30 tons a day. Hour The price at the condenser works out at about 8s. M. a ton, but ® as much again has to be paid for transport in the town in small 1 * quantities. On the quarantine island there is a smaller condenser, it said to turn out about 15 tons a day, supplying certain individuals Wt and not the general public ; the price of its water works out at mji £1 165. 8c?. per ton, including transport to shore. The price of good drinking-water from wells and springs varies down to about 10s. tbenu per ton, including transport; in 1912 it stood at the extraordinarily fflik high rate of about £1 a ton. At that time, and for two years pre viously , there had been practically no rain-water from cisterns; roTfi! when there is any, its price is generally about 18s. per ton, including ' mi transport. ontii The bazaar (southern quarter) is well supplied. A petroleum engine for a flour-mill, turning out about 18 cwt. of flour daily, was and tj reported to have been set up and to be working in 1912 ; it is of e eiib British manufacture. A portable hospital, made of compressed ooti paper and well equipped, was set up by the Turkish Government theii 11 1911 outside the town for the accommodation of 100 pilgrims. The climate of Jiddah, though hot, is not unhealthy, the sea-breeze htk counteracting to some extent the insanitary condition of streets vet, anc l houses ; but mortality is high, and bubonic plague to some extent probably endemic.

The anchorage ' sma ^ we ^ protected by the reef, which extends nearly | mile jtleifi tlle m osque, and by two reefs eastward of it; the best entrance is apparently that close eastward of the mosque reef, where the -depths are from 4 to 6 fathoms (mud). To the W. of the inner ^anchorage is Agha islet, which is small, low, and sandy, and has on oil fitseveral houses. The outer anchorage is from I to 1 mile SSW. j;if of Agha islet, in from 10 to 14 fathoms (mud) ; but there is no . shelter here from northerly or north-westerly winds. 15. Mecca, the chief town of Hejaz and the holy city of Islam,124 HEJAZ lies in a deep, narrow valley about 50 miles (crow-fly) inland from Jiddah. The valley runs up northwards with a slight easterly trend, and the hills on either side, rising several hundred feet, enclose it | isf' so completely that it was never thought necessary to encircle it with Ai a wall. The ancient wall merely barred the three entrances to the valley, where gates led into the town ; but walls and gates have fcj® disappeared, the names of the latter only surviving. ii» The road from Medina and the S. track from Jiddah join under ifcS Jebel Hindi, and enter the city by the W. gate, the Bab el-'Omrah utirij (formerly known also as the Bab ez-Zahir from a village of that name), otewi The road from Yemen approaches up the main valley, and enters tfioh the Masfalah, or lower city, by the S. gate. The road from the ntei N. gate, the Bab el-Ma'la, leads from the upper quarter of the town t|tt to Mina and 'Arafat. Considerable suburbs are built out to the N. kte of the city, and just beyond the gate is the Mala cemetery ; farther up the valley is the Bedouin quarter, Ma'abdah (or Mu'abidah), and mi the camp of the Egyptian pilgrims. The camp of the Syrian pilgrims lies to the NW., at the point where the Medina road crosses the N. Uk track from Jiddah. On the SW., below Jebel 'Omar, is the other at® great cemetery, Shebeikah; and the camp of the Yemen pilgrims ate I lies outside the S. gate on the E. side of the valley. The length of the anii town from the S. gate to the northern suburbs is about 2 miles, and taso: its greatest breadth is about a mile and a third. sfft The great mosque, the Beit Allah, containing the Ka'bah (seeChap- tte ter II), lies in the lower part of the town, and its vast courtyatd Ik and colonnades break the line of the streets which run longitudinally Ijtk up the valley. On three sides it is completely built in with houses, t0« whose upper windows command a view of the courtyard and the sbh Ka'bah. The Madrasah, adjoining the mosque on its NW. and SW. til] sides, intended as lodgings for students and teachers of Moham- imh medan law and doctrine, has long been let out to wealthy pilgrims; Jiig lectures are now given between the pilgrim seasons in the mosque Hep; itself, and a poorly furnished public library is maintained for the lai use of students. Immediately above the mosque a broad street, lia® the Mas'ah, runs from SE. to NW. across the valley, and at either listors end of it are the sacred hills Safa and Merwah (see Chapter II). This niilifl street forms the principal bazaar and centre of Meccan life ; the piljtiuj other chief bazaars are in smaller streets in the neighbourhood of Ile c j the mosque. Many are roofed over, as in Damascus and Baghdad, and there are some good shops. The houses of the town are all of '^j stone, many of them well built and three or four storeys high, with i)j terraced roofs and large projecting windows. The main streets are aloijj fairly wide and clean.DISTRICTS AND TOWNS 125 The water-supply is derived from springs at Jebel 'Arafat, the water being brought to Mecca by a conduit, which runs underground / * through the city. Here it is tapped at intervals by pits resembling wlti wells ; the water is good (containing a large amount of chlorides), illi ' : and is fairly abundant. The water-carriers form a special class; 5 a ' 8 they carry the water in skins and supply houses at a fixed rate per month according to the quantity required. The only well in Mecca MMc is the Holy Well, Zemzem, in the court of the mosque, employed entirely for religious and medicinal purposes. The special class of water-carriers and attendants, who dispense it free, are supported by voluntary contributions. The well is about 40 ft. deep, and the water is unusually brackish and contaminated. It is regarded as of it a panacea for many bodily as well as spiritual ills, and is used both mttot for drinking and ablutions; many pilgrims have it brought to their tn : houses in order to wash themselves and their clothes in it; a canister, abii containing a pint or so, is the most valued present that can be riaijl brought from Mecca. The soil of Mecca and its immediate neighbourhood is almost is to entirely barren. There are hardly any gardens, and all supplies neip: are brought in from outside, fruit and vegetables from Ta'if, rice and foreign products from Jiddah ; poultry can be obtained at reasonable prices, and mutton, milk, and butter are plentifully supplied from the desert. Very little live stock is kept locally, except donkeys and camels. There are no local industries, and all classes of the population live 0^1 by the Pilgrimage, acting as guides and directors during the sacred Jdl ceremonies, contractors for transport and the like. Considerable sums are also realized by the letting of houses, of which many more exist than the permanent population requires. Besides the resident merchants, traders arrive from all parts of the Mohammedan world during the Pilgrimage, and do a considerable business (see p. 101). The permanent population, exclusive of soldiers, is about 70,000 (the largest urban aggregate in Arabia), including about 12,000 Indians. The annual Pilgrimage brings normally at least 200,000 visitors into the town. The British Indian pilgrims sometimes % number as many as 20,000, besides 4,000 or 5,000 British Malay w ; pilgrims. |7 J The climate of Mecca is very hot and very dry, but not unhealthy. 11 !. The town is so shut in by the surrounding hills that a breeze seldom 111 ^ reaches it, and the heat reflected from the rock-faces increases the )in g glare by day and the closeness of the atmosphere at night. Rain W falls only once or twice a year, but it is tropical in its violence, and does considerable damage to the town. On these occasions, during126 HEJAZ the inundation (seil), the mosque is often flooded to a depth of several feet, since it lies lower than the surrounding city, whose level has been gradually raised by accumulated debris through the destruction and rebuilding of the houses. A former attempt to mitigate the inundation by throwing a dam across the valley was not successful, and the flood-water is allowed to escape through the town and out into the open valley by the south gate. During the Pilgrimage there is always peril of devastating epidemics, for the present quarantine system is useless, and the camps of the poorer pilgrims are crowded and most insanitary. Cholera is most dreaded; the bubonic plague, though equally deadly, is not feared so much, owing to its comparatively slow rate of development and to the speedy dispersal of the pilgrims after the ceremonies. There are three forts above the town, the largest on the SE.; of the others, one lies to the W. on a mound called Filfll below Jebel Hindi, the other to the N. on a low hill opposite the Sherif's house. Normally a Turkish garrison of at least three battalions with field and mountain guns is stationed at Mecca. There are two barracks, one to the E. of the principal fort, the other and more important at the northern end of the town. The Vali of Hejaz resided at Mecca (in summer at Ta'if); for the Emir (Grand Sherif) see Chapter II. In addition to the profits of the Pilgrimage, the town received an annual Government grant {surra), and the customs duties levied at Jiddah and Yambo'. It was always free of tax and military service. The public buildings include a court-house, post-office, and other government offices ; there are also baths, a hospital, and hospices for poor pilgrims from India, Java, &amp;c. A petroleum engine for a flour-mill, turning out about 1^ ton of flour daily, was set up in 1909, and in January 1912 two others of the same size had been imported and were being set up; they are all of British manufacture.

Ta'if is a walled town, situated in a sandy plain surrounded by low hills, on the high plateau about 75 miles SE. of Mecca, at an elevation of about 5,000 ft. It is the summer residence of the Grand Sherif and of the Vali of Hejaz, the palace of the former standing within the Bab es'-Seil with an open space before it; the citadel is on the W. side of the town. The houses are built of stone, the larger ones covered with plaster ; the town is fully inhabited only in the summer months, when the more wealthy Meccans remove there from the capital. Ta'if is much cooler than Mecca, and has a plentiful water-supply. Both in climate and physical character the district resembles the highlands of Asir and Yemen, the monsoon or tropicalDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 127 0 a % rains, which are unknown elsewhere in Hejaz, falling heavily in the ? ; early autumn.

Even now it is not always understood by natives to denote the same or any clearly defined region. It is con venient, however, to apply the term to all the area intervening between the southern limit of Hejaz (a line drawn inland from Lith) and the northern boundary of the jurisdiction of the Imam of Yemen (about lat 17° 15' N.). To this must be added the seaboard and the maritime plain down to lat. 16°, where the Wadi 'Ain divides the Idrisi territory from that of the Turks. Its extension from the Ke Sea to the east is difficult to define, since, as is the case with Hejaz, its eastern districts are not separated by any exact boundary from the steppes and deserts of Nejd. A line drawn from the coast to Bishah measures about 180 miles. In the southern part the boundary marches with that of the Yam tribes of Nejran. Relief Internally this region is still not sufficiently known for the details of its relief to be described ; but, broadly, it may be said that the first Hejaz zone, the low sandy maritime belt, is prolonged southwards with a breadth of 20 or 30 miles through Asir to meet the Tihamah of Yemen, while the second, third, and fourth Hejaz zones are, in Asir, less sharply distinguished one from another. Instead of the low, rounded, and dusty hills which form the second zone in Hejaz, we find a lofty escarpment backed by a plateau region (third zone), which falls little, if at all, eastwards towards the foot of the main ridge of the fourth Hejaz zone. This ridge is here uniformly higher than in Hejaz, ranging iromRELIEF 129 6,000 to 7,000 ft. or more. Prom its crest-line, lying on an average about 80 miles from the coast (nearer in the'north and farther m the south), the land-level falls away gradually north-eastward towards Nejd. to undeistof ion. liii ise ) dfo 1 from : onn ah] tall th '■ r: Physical Character and Climate Since Asir receives the fringe of the monsoon, which reaches Yemen m autumn, and since it provides a lofty, gradually inclined and broad catchment area, the wide valleys which run from the main ridge, not only south-westward down the short seaward slope, but north-eastward down the long slope towards Central Arabia are comparatively fertile. All this north-eastern slope is seamed with valleys—main wadis like Wadi Ranyah, Wadi Bishah tributaries like Wadi Shahran (or Sahran) and Wadi 'Aqiq divided' by high hills or dusty intervals of steppe. The larger valleys carry water throughout the year either on or near the surface of their channels, and since large tracts of both Mrmh and nefud desert are absent, the aspect of the innermost zone ot Asir is very different from the corresponding district in Heiaz. Tamisier, who m 1834 traversed what we should now call the NE.' ; and hE. boundaries of Asir, speaks even with enthusiasm of the smiling and fertile appearance of some of the valleys which he visited ; but he left untouched some of the most productive districts Ihe principal wadis run towards Wadi Dawasir, in Southern Neid. t what is their exact ultimate destination, and how far inland their fertility is maintained, we do not at present know. : The inland edge of the main ridge is almost uniformly fertile and the country from Tanumah to Thimniyah compares favourablv with any m the central highlands of Yemen. To the east of the main ridge long and broad ribbons of oasis trending north occur frequentlv and serve to keep an agricultural and settled element preponderant m the population. The dusty intervals of steppe between wadis are good for nothing except lean pasturage ; but the valleys them selves are well watered and produce good crops of cereals and fruit m abundance Whde invaders —such as the Egyptian armies which traversed the region from time to time between 1832 and 1841 ai: av ? doubtless suffered from insufficiency of supplies, this has been due partly to the nature of country to be crossed between the mam valleys, and partly to the fact that districts fertile enough nnoSo ^ ee io S nnA re unab i e ^ unwilling to support hostile forces tt i?'w l ' ! 00 f len - Suc h a force remained encamped in Wadi ARA^iv I r a g t in 1834 - The dist rict round Khamis Musheit J]130 ASIR is described in modern days as fertile ; and Wadi Shahran, a tributary of Wadi Bishah, is called by Tamisier ' a jewel coveted by all conquerors The seaward slopes of the mam ridge, and the escarpments which lead down to the Tihamah, are in the north of Asir barren and forbidding, except in the valleys ; in the south they are covered in many places with dense woods and tra versed by many rivulets. The intervening plateau, though hotter than the main ridge, is nevertheless productive and well watered and supports a large population. ^ r . • ,1 While the highlands are the most productive part of Asir, the Tihamah or seaboard country, though throughout sandy and salty is less barren than in Hejaz, and indeed in the Qunfudah, Hall, and Sabia districts yields a fair amount of produce. In the southern and central Tihamah, light and local rains occasionally fall in February and March, and there is a heavier precipitation in June during the season of the Kharif. Farther north, both in the Tihamah and inland the rainfall is irregular. The most favoured localities are the 'Aqabah and main ridge, which receive a copious precipitation during the autumnal monsoon and occasional showers in June and July. Tamisier speaks from experience of very violent thunder and rain in the neighbourhood of Khamis Musheit in the month of July. The climate of the Tihamah, which is subject to strong SW. winds, is as hot as in Hejaz ; but the water-supply is both more abundant and of better quality. The inner country is cooler on the whole than in Hejaz, the 'Aqabah and plateau being better favoured than the corresponding Hejaz zones ; the climate of this hill country is described by the Arabian Gazetteer as temperate. On the inland slopes of the ridge, which has a general north-eastward aspect, the winter is comparatively severe: night frosts are regular an frequent. Population The total population of Asir, if calculated from the numbers of fighting men, mentioned later in the description of tribes, would be 1,500,000. These numbers, however, are based entirely on native information and are probably much too high ; but they are given in the absence of any more positive and reliable data. The niam con stituent is a highland farmer element, warlike and tenacious of liberty, living in the upper wadis on both flanks of the main ridge, but ony in a few places collected into urban settlements of any considerable size. Qunfudah on the coast, Muha'il, Rijal, Khamis Musheit, 1 a ; Sabia inland, may be called towns, and there are many largePOPULATION 131 iJ 1 ' villages where the local trade is focused : but the available descrip- .'2 of inland settlements suggest, rather than towns, villages fflri w ith chains of dependent farmsteads and groups of huts distributed ■ arf t along the valley bottom and sides and often protected by forts on e yM the adjacent heights. In the last century Wadi Bishah is said to have possessed sixty villages, and the number has not decreased. As inNejran, the Jauf of Yemen, and Hadhramaut, these settlements serve as nuclei of tribes with fringes of unsettled elans, which roam the intervening steppes and mountain heights in quest of pasturage. There has always been a strong social and political distinction between the farmers of the lower inland wadis and those of the upper mM * parts and the main ridge—the proper ' Asir '—as well as between ' sontta the latter and the men of the 'Aqabah and Tihamah. But the dis- 11 inii tinction goes farther than this, and in no part of Arabia are the tribal ine (hi elements more sharply defined or their boundaries more immutably TiMili fixed than in Asir. There is an understanding in times of peace i local® that members of one tribe may pass through the territories of ispiecipb another when furnished with a hhawi, or guide, by the latter ; but Tsinfe attempts on the part of strangers to settle in ' foreign' territory nttbuife are seldom countenanced, nor does intermarriage often take place, month-'i This rule is relaxed only in the larger places of mixed population^ insSffl such as Qunfudah, Ibha, and Sabia, and in Bishah, where the g Arabs from all the neighbouring tribes collect for a four months' jjt truce during the date-season and where many of them possess their own lands. In religious persuasion practically all the Asir tribes belong to Ontt^ . e Shafei school of the Sunni sect. Wahabism has a few adherents rardafl north-east, and its tenets are regarded with a certain sympathy • e regnlf 0 ver the country ; but there is everywhere a strong antipathy to Zeidism, which has made no headway. The tribes under the immediate influence of Idrisi subscribe to his tarlqah, whose practices and tenets are akin to those of the Senussi fraternity, and are, of course, Shafei. u ihc ®i. I J; is in Asir that, proceeding through Arabia from the north, of trite : we first encounter settled tribes as the predominant element in the ^o^population, and for the simple reason that there, for the first time, lieT^P physical conditions admit generally of such agriculture as fjjeiiii^turns sufficient sustenance within a convenient radius of a settle- acion^Kr e ^i ren( ier nomadism—always a pis —not necessary, nri# ' 11 j- 0 + • noraadi . sm unknown in Asir any more than in any other inv co# 1 ls ^ lct Arabia : agriculture by irrigation in wadis has to be tahei^ e 0 y pasturage on the hills, and the climatic conditions .p iii# 3ause P as turage to be too scanty and evanescent for flock-owners 81 12132 ASIR and herdsmen to keep within easy range of any particular settle ment throughout the year. Moreover, not only do stretches of steppe, often little better than desert, occur m the Asir Tihamah (as in that of Yemen, and on the southern littoral), but the inland slopes of the main ridge (as again in Yemen and even m Oman) rapidlv thin out into steppe-land and finally into sheer desert. Therefore almost all Asir tribes include a nomadic clan or two, although only a few units are in the mam or wholly nomadic Settled Arabs multiply more rapidly than unsettled, and tribes which for any reason have abandoned wandering life for fixed agriculture have often been known to double or treble their num- bers in two or three generations. Obvious reasons for such increase are better quality and greater quantity of food-stuffs enjoyed m settled life, and the easier conditions which obtain for women in pregnancy and parturition and for their offspring during infancy. This fact has to be borne in mind when judging the high totals given by native authorities for the population of such regions as Asir and Yemen ; but, at the same time, it is generally safe to divide such totals by two, if not by a higher divisor. In any case no means of checking the Asiri figures exists, the actual numbers of fighting men known to have been put in line on any occasion beine no good criterion in so divided and distracted a region. The most numerous and powerful tribes occupy the mam ridge with the heads of the inland valleys and the upper parts of the 'Aqabah. Here we find in succession from north to south the great units of the Zahran, the Ghdmid, the Shamrdn, the Balaryan, the Bulqarn, the Beni Shihir, the four tribes of the the Reish, the Al Musa, the Balasmar, the Rabi Balahmar. With the next two tribes, the Rijal el-M and the Bern Muqheid, the most famous and most developed tribal organiza 1° Asir, we reach the heart of the country, the surroundings of ibha (Manadhir), the hinterland of Mikhlaf (or Makhlaf) el-Yemen and t region of Wadi Bishah. The strong tribes of the Beni Malik (to be distinguished from the Hejaz tribe of that name) and Rabi'at el -Yemen also lie round Ibha; andbehmd all th ^ and intruded among them, in a wedge of territory w 1C . from the heads of Wadis Bishah and Shahran to withm twenty miles of Sabia, lies the most numerous of all Asm tribes, the Mahm_ Finally, in the south-eastern interior of the region live tti ^ QaUdn tribes, each an autonomous unit, and none of them confounded with the nomad Qahtan of the south -wester of Central Arabia. The Tihamah tribes are, as a rule, smaller units and less vigPOPULATION 133 In the north, where the land conditions are least favourable, they take largely to seafaring. The D and Dhawi Barakat who occupy the coast from Lith to Uruj, are fishermen and pirates. The Zoheid (or Zuheid) sub-tribe of the Harb, which succeeds to these, contains also some sailors, but with it and the Beni Zeid of the Qunfudah district begin predominantly agricultural units, which generally own one or more port-villages, or, sitting astride tiie tracks to the interior, profit by commerce even if they do not practise it. So live the Beld'ir, the AM Hali federation, the Hilal, the Munjahah. After the last begins the favoured and well-settled district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen, where the Idrisi has established some sort of law and order, increasing from the north which is held by the Beni Shi'bah and the Naj l u, to his home-land of babia and Abu 'Arish. His authority holds to the southern limit ot Asir ; but the comparatively small tribes lying south of the Abu Arish, of which the Masdrihah, the the the Bern Aslam, and the Beni'Abs are the more important, better maintain tribal autonomy and in means and manner of life approxi- U . nits holdin g the coast north of Mikhlaf el-Yemen. The following table shows the tribal influence of the Turks Idrisi, and the Emir of Mecca respectively in 1914. In cases where tribal allegiance is divided, only important divergences are noted, completely independent tribes are given in a fourth column. (a) Tribes of the Maritime Plain from 16° 'Ain) Turk.

In the Tihamah their dwelling-places are rounded huts of straw id) Bafai with pointed roofs, and are generally surrounded by a straw com- ni Shki# pound. The floors are of pounded clay with a raised place for ^ Skkii a fire. Their beds resemble the of the Sudan, a lacing of rope or thongs on a wooden framework supported by four wooden legs. _ . Up the 'Aqabah and along the main ridge a man s house is nis fortress, and is built to last. The big chiefs have huge rambling structures massively built of stone and sometimes running up to four or five storeys. The doors are solid, the windows square with wooden shutters, and the roofs flat, supported by stout beams over which are laid branches of trees and then a surface of clay. Each house has its own yard surrounded by a stone wall. The houses of the Shahran and Qahtan tribes are of a similar type, save that above the first floor they are built of clay. Inside there is little furniture, but the houses are kept scrupulously clean, and are never used as privies as is the case elsewhere in Arabia. For beds straw mats are used, covered with a thick sheepskin-coat {fanvah), or rug. In all big houses a separate room is set aside for the kitchen. In eating, the men kneel on their haunches round a big wooden platter and help themselves with their fingers. Copper cooking utensils come from Aden, copper coffee-pots from Mecca, while clay plates, water jars, and cups are made locally. Artificial light is only seen in the houses of the rich, where small petroleum lamps are used. Clothes come almost entirely from Aden. The local manufactures are few and unimportant. Certain tribes make their own goat-hair tents and saddles; saddlebags and leathern belts are usually home-made. The Rijal el-M'a are known for their straw-woven articles, such as matting, baskets, and hats {toffush) which are largely worn by the women of Asir. Most of the swords and long curved knives are finished locally, the steel being imported from Aden and worked into shape by the local smiths. The A1 Yazid section of the Beni Mugheid are noted for their skill in this. Arms and ammunition, of course, come exclusively from abroad, but the Beni Shihir are said to pro duce an inferior kind of powder. The rifles are badly treated, the sights being knocked off and the stocks pared down. It is the custom in some tribes to cut a notch on the stock for each man killed.136 ASIR Agricultuke Cultivation in the Tihamah is dependent partly on the local rainfall and partly on the water from the wadis which comes down in flood from the hills. In all the larger wadi-beds dams are made and the water led off in channels on to the surrounding land. In most places there are two harvests, the spring and the summer, but the Hali district produces three. The principal crops are duklnn and dhura, sesame, cotton, and the more common kinds of native vegetables. The most productive regions are between Hali and Qunfudah and Mikhlaf el-Yemen. Inland, in the hills and plateaus, and lucerne are grown during the winter ; the summer crops are wheat, barley, lentils, potatoes, and onions. Wada'ah produces grapes in large quantities which are converted into raisins and sold throughout Asir; and in the Beni Malik country and Ibha figs, grapes, apricots, and a poor sort of olives are grown. Coffee is cultivated by the Rijal el-M'a, by the Balasmar round Jebel Haddah, and by the Beni Mugheid near Sijam and Radha, but not in quantities sufficient for local consumption. Dates are grown in a few places on the coast such as Birk, but by far the largest production is in the fertile valley of Bishah, where lemons, oranges, and are also cultivated extensively. Inland Asir is richer than the Tihamah, and the main ridge in the centre and south is almost uniformly productive. The best districts are Rijal el-M'a, Thimniyah, Barak, Ibha, and Tanumah, Live Stock The Tihamah produces cattle, sheep, goats, and camels in large numbers. Donkeys of a big white breed are used for riding, and there is also a smaller type, grey in colour, for carrying burdens. Horses are only found in Mikhlaf el-Yemen, and are all imported from inland. There are no mules. In the mountains the same varieties of animals are found, but the camels are all inured to mountain work in a colder climate, and no Arab would think of taking his beasts down to the plains. The Tihamah-bred animals would, of course, fare equally badly inland. The mountain camels are for the most part white in colour, but those of the Qahtan and Shahran are black. The two latter tribes are the chief horse-owners. They will sell their poorer beasts, but rarely part with their pedigree animals, of whom they take the greatest care. Dogs in Asir are generally well treated, and there is a large black breed which makes an excellent type of watch-dog.TRADE 137 Trade Import trade by sea. Qunfudah, Birk, Shuqaiq, Jeizan, and Midi are the five ports through which goods enter Asir. Qunfudah is chiefly used for supplying Turkish needs there and at Ibha. The Asiri's necessities are few, and the import list is therefore short. Besides arms and ammunition, cotton piece-goods, steel, sugar, petroleum, rice, and cooking utensils are the chief items. Import trade by land. From the south, practically the only commodity which enters Asir is coffee. This is chiefly produced round Jebel Razah (or Razeh) and taken in by the pilgrim road to the Qahtan country, where it is bought up by the Qahtan merchants at Khamis 'Abidah. The imports from the Hejaz are still more ij! limited and seem to be confined chiefly to copper coffee-pots. Export trade. The export trade is only carried on at present on a small scale, but is capable of considerable development. The Tihamah exports to Jiddah wheat, dulchn, dh and dried fish, chiefly in the pilgrim season. The remainder of the exports go either to Aden or Musawwa'. These consist of skins, and wool, both from the Tihamah and inland; cotton from the Hali district, dom-imts from the Munjahah, gum from the Shahran and Qahtan, dates from Bishah, and honey from the Rijal el-M'a. Cattle are also exported to Musawwa', when the absence of cattle plague permits. Merchants from the Hadhramaut control most of the general trade, both import and export, with the outside world. The Rijal el-M'a also take their share, though they reserve themselves chiefly for the arms traffic, and there are a few Indian traders. Internal trade. In all the main necessities of life, each tribal district is self-supporting. The chief distributing centres of what to the Asiri are luxuries are Sabia (Mikhlaf el-Yemen), Sheibein, and Rijal (Rijal el-M'a), Ibha (Beni Mugheid), Khamis Musheit (Shahran), Khamis 'Abidah ('Abidah Qahtan), Kiyad (Hali District), Sabt Ibn el-'Arif (Beni Shihir), Khamis el-Makwar (Ghamid), Dus (Zahran), and Qunfudah (Beni Zeid). Most of the output of dates from Bishah is brought to Khamis Musheit for distribution by merchants who go to Bishah early in the season, well supplied with general goods, such as rifles, ammunition, coffee, piece-goods, &amp;c. Merchants from Sabia procure all their horses from the Qahtan. Wada'ah produces raisins and sends them chiefly to Khamis 'Abidah. After the Rijal el-M'a the most enterprising traders of the interior are the Qahtan, and especially the Rufeidat el-Yemen section of that tribe.138 ASIR cljbbency The only coins in universal use throughout Asir are the Abu Hautah, a small nickel coin worth half a Turkish piastre, and the Maria Theresa dollar, locally called ' Riyal Fransah' and valued at 12 Turkish piastres. In and round Ibha and Qunfudah the ordinary Turkish coins are in circulation, but they do not pass elsewhere with the exception of the lira, and even that is regarded with suspicion. English sovereigns (known as are more popular and are current at 120 Turkish piastres in most places. In the Tihamah, especially in the south, 2 anna and 1 anna pieces (both known as Abu Surah) are found and are valued at P.T. 2 and P.T. 1 respectively. The rupee, however, has not been introduced. In many places in Asir barter is the chief medium of exchange. Weights and Measures In Qunfudah and Ibha the Turks have introduced their own standards of weights and measures. In the mountainous districts wooden bowls of certain standard sizes are employed for dry commodities, according to the following table : 3 ohes = 1 mid 4 mids — 1 sd 3 sahs = 1 F Bowls representing halves and eighths of are also used. In the Tihamah the scale is slightly different in nomenclature, viz.: 4 oJces = 1 heilah 3 keilahs = 1 3 sahs = 1 These measures of content are chiefly employed in the big market places. Elsewhere the practice seems to consist simply in placing a commodity in small piles (akwdm) and making a rough calculation of its bulk. Land is measured as follows, the feddan being somewhat smaller than the Egyptian feddan. 2 Fellejs = Ralcib 4 Rakibs — 1 Zahab 2 Zahabs = 1 Fedddn.v: RECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 139 Recent History and Present Politics Politically Asir cannot be regarded as one, except on the Ottoman theory that it forms, as a whole, the northern sub-province or sanjalc of the vilayet of Yemen. In reality it falls into four parts, one completely independent and three acknowledging, respectively, the influence of the Emir, or Grand Sherif, of Mecca, the Turks, or the Idrisi. The three latter, it is hardly necessary to remark, are constantly changing as the power of one or the other aspirants to supremacy waxes or wanes. 1. The number of Arabs who recognize no power but their own is comparatively small, and is confined almost entirely to nomad tribes such as the Rabi'ah Mujatirah and Rabi'at et-Tahahin, who dwell in inaccessible mountain country on the 'Aqabah, and to nomad sections of certain of the eastern tribes such as the Ghamid, Shahran, and' Abidah, who wander far out to the east, where they are beyond control. There is no cohesion or fixed purpose amongst these, and politically they are of little account. 2. The Emir of Mecca's influence was chiefly evident amongst the powerful tribes of Ghamid, Beni Shihir, and Shahran, who live on the inland side of the main ridge. He is connected by marriage with the paramount chief of the Beni Shihir and is a personal friend of the Ghamid and Shahran Sheikhs, but he has never made any attempt to administer the country and, before the recent insurrec tion of Hejaz against the Turks (see Chapter IV), it appeared doubtful whether he had much influence among the tribesmen. In 1910 he got into touch with many of the tribes between Lith and Ibha, during his campaign against the Idrisi; but how far he had maintained relations since then was a matter of speculation. 3. The Turks never succeeded in completely subduing Asir, and recently they had only a precarious hold on the port of Qunfudah and the inland towns of Muha'il and Ibha, with a small district round each of these places and, intermittently, the roads from one to the other. They were in touch with the Beni Shihir and Shahran, but chiefly by virtue of their relations with the Emir. 4. As for what remains, the Idrisi has either administered or federated it—that is, the Qahtan tribes of southern inland Asir and most of the Tihamah and 'Aqabah lands from the Wadi 'Ain in the south to the confines of Lith—a strip of nearly 350 miles from north to south by roughly 70 broad ; its home-land is in the Mikhlaf el-Yemen district, with Sabia as capital and the ports of Midi and Jeizan. This is a rather broad section of the Tihamah sloping up *140 ASIR for some 40 miles to the foot of the 'Aqabah, or scarp of the highlands, and about 80 miles long from north to south. Before Mohammed 'Ali cast covetous eyes on Asir the whole country from Dhahran almost to Ta'if was in the hands of the ruling family of Beni Mugheid, whose capital was Manadhir, or Ibha as it is now called. The Emir at the time of the Egyptian expedition in 1834 was 'A'idh ibn Mura'i who, with the help of his sturdy hillmen, succeeded in defeating the invaders. The country then had rest from foreign aggression until 1869 when, the Suez Canal having been opened, the Porte sent troops under Ra'uf Pasha to deal with the Yemen and Asir in earnest. In 1871 Mohammed, son of 'A'idh, attacked Hodeidah, but was repulsed with great loss, and in the next year Mukhtar Pasha, who had succeeded Ra'uf Pasha, invaded and subdued Asir. He was helped by the Rijal el-M'a, who had unsuccessfully rebelled against the Emir and were burning to avenge their defeat. The Turks administered most of the country until the revolt of_ Idrisi reduced their power to its present limits. The house of 'A'idh, though deprived of much of its former glory, is still important, and Hasan ibn 'Ali, the present head, is Vali or Turkish Civil Governor of Asir. There is in Mikhlaf el-Yemen a very old tradition of independence which has been maintained against both the Turks and the Yemenite tribes on the one hand, and the tribes of the inland mountains on the other. Between 1830 and 1840 Abu 'Arish was ruled by a certain Sherif 'Ali, who made terms with the Egyptians in order to free himself from the Emir 'A'idh ibn Mura'i, During his reign one Seyyid Ahmed el-Idrisi, a native of Fez, and head of a religious fraternity school (tarlqah) which he had preached in a school at Mecca since 1799, acquired land at Sabia, settled there, and died (1837) in the odour of sanctity. He had been the teacher of the original Senussi (see p. 33), who took the covenant in his in 1823. The Idrisi family increased in wealth during the lifetime of Seyyid Ahmed's son and grandson; and appears, after the defeat of Sherif Husein of Abu 'Arish, to have supplanted the Sherifial family. It intermarried with the Senussi house, settled in Cyrenaica, and had branches at Zeinia near Luxor in Egypt and in the Sudan at Argo. But the expansion of its political power to include not only all Mikhlaf el-Yemen, but the Tihamah and 'Aqabah north and south, and a suzerainty over several tribes outside those limits (e. g, in the Sa'dah district) is the work of Seyyid Ahmed's great-grandson, Seyyid Mohammed, the present Idrisi. Born at Sabia in 1876, educated partly in Egypt (at Zeinia and at El-Azhar, Cairo) and partly by the Senussi at Kufra, after residenceRECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 141 otlE at Argo and marriage, Seyyid Mohammed returned to Sabia, deter mined to render Asir independent of the Turks and to aggrandize himself at their expense. By 1910 he had driven them back to their present holding ; but he failed to take Ibha against oppo sition organized by the Emir of Mecca. Subsidized and supplied by the Italians during the Tripolitan War he consolidated himself in the south, and though the Emir seduced much of his tribal following after the Peace of Ouchy, he recovered himself during the Balkan War. Failing in 1914 to secure recognition from the Young Turks as more than Kaimmakam of Sabia and Abu 'Arish, he declared definitely against them on their entry into the present struggle, signed a treaty with our Resident at Aden in May 1915, and took the field in June with a following of some 12,000 men from Abu 'Arish and certain tribes of the 'Aqabah and Tihamah (Beni Marwan, Beni Aslam, Beni Hasan, Beni 'Abs, &amp;c.), and the Qahtan. However, he has not succeeded in taking Loheia, though he has overrun much of the northern Tihamah of Yemen, and raised part of the Zaranik and other Tihamah tribes against the Turks. His power rests largely on his personality, but to some extent also on hereditary sanctity and on the wealth and influence of his connexions, notably those with the Senussi. His most implacable foe, after the Turks, is the Imam of Yemen, and the only potentate really friendly to him in Arabia is Ibn Sa'ud. The Emir of Mecca, however, is now disposed to keep on terms and is anxious to reconcile the differences between him and the Imam Yahya. Idrisi's standing army consists of about 500 Sudanese re cruited from the villages round his capital, Sabia, and chiefly used for police work or as his personal guard in normal times. In times of war he depends entirely on the tribes for support. His system is simple. He has about 10 Muqaddams or generals, almost invariably chosen from the leading families of Sadah (Seyyids) or Ashraf (Sherifs), each of whom is entrusted with a district or a group of tribes with which he is required to keep in touch at all times. When troops are required, each general is ordered to produce a specified number of men, and he in turn makes the tribal Sheikhs responsible for carrying out the order. Exemption is purchased by the payment of 24 riyals. The army thus formed is a conglomeration of small bands, skilled in tribal warfare but untrained and undisciplined according to European standards, and generally divided against itself by petty tribal quarrels and jealousies. Each tribal unit brings its own food and as many rifles as it can, and Idrisi is responsible for making up the number and for supplying ammunition. In addition he has142 ASIR to make handsome presents to all the chief Sheikhs. Unless there is a good prospect of loot, it is difficult to collect the Arabs in any numbers, and in any case their natural independence and their dislike of restraint render them unsuitable for a long campaign. This and their disinclination to face modern artillery were among the chief causes which led to their failure before Loheia in 1915. Idrisi is poorly supplied with artillery and its ammunition, and with trained men to serve the guns. Theoretically he can put a very large army into the field, but in practice he probably cannot muster more than 25,000 men. He is hampered by the fact that the tribes refuse to go far from their own boundaries, and therefore has to depend on the material available in the particular district in which he is operating. Towns The following are the principal towns of Asir : 1. Bishah (Qal'ah Bishah), a town, or more probably an aggregate of many villages, farmsteads, and groups of huts, in the wadi of the same name, about 240 miles ESE. of Mecca. It is an important halting-place on the route between Wadi Dawasir, the Haramein, and the Red Sea coast. There is a ruined fortress, and the town marks the end of the oasis. Bishah is well watered by a stream going in a north-easterly direction, which, with a number of other inland streams, according to Jomard and Chedufau (but, probably, it is not so) collect at last in the Wadi Dawasir. The town is surrounded by cultivation, in part carried on by the nomads. It was occupied for a fortnight by the Egyptian force in 1834. 2. Turabah, about 90 miles SE. of Ta'if, and on the main thorough fare from Nejd into Yemen. It is a walled town as large as Ta'if, surrounded by palm-groves and well-watered gardens. Near it are low hills where cereals are grown. 3. Ibha (Ebha), said to be a stone-built town situated on a hill in the middle Asir, in the upper reaches of Wadi Bishah, and about 139 miles crow-fly SSW. of Qal'ah Bishah. It was garrisoned by the Turks, when they held Asir, and was then the residence of a Mutesarrif. The town was formerly known as Manadhir, and this name survives as that of the quarter or ward where the citadel is situated. It is an important centre of con vergent roads in Asir (see Routes Nos. 40-47). 4. Muha'il, an inland town on the 'Aqabah just west of the main escarpment of the plateau region of Asir, and some 72 miles distant from the coast at Qunfudah. It is an important centre of severalHW Neat J' was' TOWNS 143 convergent roads: from Ibha (Routes Nos. 45 and 46), from Qunfudah (Routes No. 49 and 50), from Hali Point (Route No. 51), and from Birk (Route No. 52). Little or no information is available about the size or character of the town. 5. TChamis Musheit, an important town in the most productive district of S. Asir. It stands in the hills, considerably S. of the upper reaches of Wadi Bishah, and about 125 miles ESE. of the port of Qunfudah, with which it is connected by a track. There is good water and a bazaar, and the town is a market for the distribution of dates. 6. Abu 'Arish, a town on the route between Jiddah and Loheia, about 70 miles crow-fly north of the latter. It is the principal settlement of the province of the same name; the town con tains many stone houses, and there are many wells and much cultivation. Niebuhr describes it as ' a walled town and residence of a Sherif ', and adds that ' in the neighbourhood are a number of small hills, where salt is obtained for export 7. Sabia {Sablyah), about 20 miles inland (4 hours' easy ride) SE. of Jeizan, in the Abu Arish district. It is Idrisi's capital, with a two-storeyed ' palace ', a fine mosque, and about 10,000 inhabitants, of whom probably only some are permanent. Most of the houses are brushwood and mat huts, but the houses of some of the principal men, as well as the Seyyid's palace, are well built of stone. There are many wells and a good deal of cultivation, with fertile country inland. Niebuhr says; ' Sabbia is a large village, noted in Yemen for its donkeys.' 8. Qunfudah, lat. 90° N., a small walled town, consisting chiefly of huts, on a bay of the Red Sea, about 200 miles S. of Jiddah. The population is not more than 2,000. There is a mosque, with a minaret prominent to seaward, on the southern side of the town outside the walls. The small bazaar is only sufficient for the needs of the place ; but plentiful supplies of cattle, sheep, and vegetables may be obtained from the interior at a few days' notice. The town is reputed to have the best water on the coast, the main supply being obtained from Hafeir, about 2-| miles distant; much grain is grown in the district round, and in July and August good grapes can be procured. Qunfudah is the port of Ibha, and lies about 72 miles from Muha'il (see Routes Nos. 49 and 50) ; another road comes in from Raghdan. The southern side of the anchorage, in the bay, is protected by a reef about a mile in length, on which there is a low bushy island, holding a ruined guard-tower. A small shoal lies between the reef and the northern point of-Qunfudah Bay, and the best channel leading to the anchorage (with a width of entrance144 ASIR of 4-|- cables and a depth of 7 fathoms) is between the shoal and reef. There are two other entrances near the shore, north and south, but these are fit only for small craft. The only steam-vessels calling at Qunfudah were those of the Austrian Lloyd Company, at intervals of about three months. 9. Hall Point is the western headland of a small bay, well sheltered from northerly and easterly winds, and is situated at about lat. 18| 0 N., some forty miles SSE. of Qunfudah. The coast is here bordered by an extensive reef which gives a certain amount of shelter to any craft that may be there. There are no houses actually on the shore, but a town or village is said to exist ' not far inland Jebel Hali is a prominent peak of the nearest coastal range, and is strikingly pyramidal in shape. 10. Jeizan, a small port settlement, hardly more than a village, in lat. 17° N., on the coast about 200 miles SSE. of Qunfudah; it lies opposite the Farsan group of islands, and is backed by the Jeizan hills. It is Idrisi's chief outlet to the sea; the other is Midi, farther south (see below). Jeizan has a few square stone buildings, but consists principally of round grass-huts with pointed roofs. A fort, on the southern side, is in a state of decay. Water is very scarce in the town, but 4 miles to the north-east are some good wells. The small bazaar is scantily supplied with native dry provisions, but fresh meat and vegetables may be procured on giving a day's notice. The population, in 1834, was 400, and the people were then, and still are, chiefly employed in the pearl fishery on the banks and reefs by which the coast is protected. Niebuhr described the town as ' situated on a hill in fertile country ', and ' having a trade in senna leaves, which grow in the district, and also coffeeThe Farsan Islands, once desired by Germany for a coaling station, are now occupied by a British garrison. 11. Midi (Medi), a large hut-village on the coast, and in 1916 an important port visited by Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshawi's steamers. Idrisi has a small fort on high ground clear of the village, a square, bastioned enclosure of mud-brick. Trade-routes run from Midi eastward to Sa'dah and San'a.CHAPTER VI YEMEN Area Excluding the sanjalc of Asir, which has practically seceded from Ottoman rule, the vilayet or province of Yemen may be described as bounded on the north by an indefinite line which places Loheia and K 1mm ir just within its borders ; on the south by the Aden Protectorate frontier as delimited in 1902—4 ; and on the west by the Red Sea. The eastern limit is vague and varies with the ebb and flow of Ottoman politics—but long. 45° E. roughly marks the extreme range of Turkish influence. If we exclude Jauf and Nejran, which are described in this chapter but considered as outlying districts, the province thus roughly measures from 200 to 250 miles from N. to S. and 150 miles from E. to W., and has an area of about 35,000 square miles. Physical Chaeactee Relief Yemen may be divided into six zones : (1) The Tihamah or littoral belt. (2) The maritime range. (3) The series of intramontane plains. (4) The Yemen ridge or main watershed. (5) The central plateau. (6) The foot-hills and plains that finally merge into the Great Red Desert. (1) The Tihamah is a level plain with a slight rise inland; Bajil, for example, which is 20 miles from the coast, is only 600 ft. above sea-level. This zone varies very much in width, from 30 miles to almost a mere beach line at Sheikh Sa'id. It is chiefly soft, sandy, and sterile desert, but there are important oases and settle ments in the larger wadis by which it is traversed from east to west. The coast-line of the Tihamah is in the main regular, low, and sandy, with here and there small rocky headlands and islands, the aeabia i k146 YEMEN best known among the latter being Kamaran Island, which lies quite near the mainland some twelve miles south of Loheia. (2) The maritime ranges throw out low foot-hills toward the coast; but here and there they culminate in massifs rising 5,000 ft. or so above sea-level. Such are Jebel Bura' and J. Reimah, while the town of Menakhah itself, which is situated in this zone, is 7,500 ft. above sea-level, and the neighbouring peak of Shibam 9,000 ft. The maritime ranges are much intersected by wadis and, although the Hodeidah-San'a road does pass through Menakhah, such gradients as it encounters need not be climbed until the main ridge has to be crossed, if these wadis are followed. There is, for example, a much easier route to San'athan the Menakhah road running up the valley of Siham (Saham) (see vol. ii. Route No. 55). (3) The intramontane plains are much intersected by foot-hills and rugged kopjes, and have an average altitude of 4,000 ft. (4) The ridge, or main watershed, has an average altitude of 9,000 ft. and is a jumbled agglomeration of mountain masses, spurs, and neks cut up in places by sheer ravines of the most formidable character and filled with boulders; and there are peaks rising occa sionally to over 10,000 ft. (5) The central plateau has an altitude of 7,600 ft. at San'a and rises gradually. southward, culminating between Yerim and Ibb, where the mean altitude is 9,000 ft. Thence, southward, it dips towards the Aden Protectorate border to a mean altitude of 5,000 ft. Its general character is that of a steppe increasing in aridity towards the E. The whole plateau is much broken by mountain ranges and tall peaks (some of which rise 2,000 ft. above the general level), especially towards the S. ; but northwards, towards Asir, it loses much of its irregular character among low scattered ranges and encroaching arms of the inland desert. It must be borne in mind that the Yemen plateau is but the south-western and most tilted corner of the great oblong plateau which forms the main physical characteristic of the peninsula of Arabia. (6) The plateau is not clearly defined eastwards, but dips gradually and opens out into comparatively barren plains between low hills : these merge eventually in the Great Red Desert, known locally as Er-Raml, ' The Sand'. The western scarp of the central plateau drains into the Red Sea through such wadis as the Suleil, Sardud, Bajil, Siham, Rema', and Zebld. None of them contain perennial water-courses, for they only flow into the sea in spate, and even then rarely; but, the slope being steep, they carry down much detritus to form not inconsiderable arable tracts in their lower courses. Among the principal wadis that trend inland andPHYSICAL CHARACTER 147 I drain the eastern scarp are the Kharid (said to be perennial), which loses itself somewhere in the sands east of Janf, and Wadis I Bana and Tiban, which lead south-eastwards towards the coast : of the Gulf of Aden. II Climate The climate of Yemen naturally varies very greatly, both in temperature and rainfall, according to altitude and district. The coast is extremely damp and, though the sea-breezes lower the temperature, the excessive humidity makes the heat very trying. Heavy winds are prevalent from the sea, from north-west in summer and south-west in winter, both uncomfortably damp. Winds from the east usually bring sandstorms, but rain seldom reaches the coast. The Tihamah is fiercely hot by day and fairly cool at night, but it is comparatively free from the enervating dampness of the coast-line; its rainfall is scanty and irregular. The maritime ranges and intramontane plains have a feverish climate with close, muggy nights, especially in the rainy season among the foot-hills ; but as one approaches the higher elevation the air becomes more healthy and bracing. The principal rainfall occurs in spring ; but, on the higher ground, in summer as well, and then chiefly as thunderstorms. On the maritime ridge, at 5,000 ft, and over, winter fogs are prevalent; mists come up from the ravines in the early after noon, and lie thick till next morning and sometimes all next day; they are not, however, without their advantages, as they favour the growth and development of the coffee plant. This zone, with its regular rainfall, due chiefly to the influence of the SW. monsoon, may be considered as the most favoured district of Arabia; broadly speaking, however, the district has two rainfalls, one in early spring and another in late summer with the NE. monsoon. The plateau has a much drier climate, of which that of San'a may be taken as fairly typical. Here it may be described as cool and pleasant all the year round : the nights are cold in winter but the days warm, and in summer the heat, though considerable, is not oppressive owing to the dryness of the air; a difference of more than 20° may be sometimes observed between the wet- and dry-bulb thermometer readings in May. The eastern plateau has much smaller and less certain rainfall than the west, the bulk of which may be expected in summer; the periods of fall, however, are often short, and local famines are not uncommon. The eastern scarp is hot and has a scanty rainfall, which decreases eastward. Here the season of such precipitation as there is extends from November to February. K 2148 YEMEN Social : Population The population of Yemen is variously estimated at from one to two millions, of whom by far the greater number are settled or nomad Arabs. Probably one million is about the truth. The resident alien population here is perhaps greater than in any other district of Arabia : there are said to be 90,000 Jews living in the interior, but this figure is probably excessive ; some 1,000 British Indians and some hundreds of Greeks, living now almost entirely in the coastal towns, principally Hodeidah; and some few Europeans of other nationality, who are either shipping merchants, or consular agents, or both. A small number of Europeans, prin cipally Greek and Italian, were until recently to be found in the towns of the interior, but owing to the unsettled state of the country they have nearly all left. It may be said that practically all the alien population except the Jews is now centred at Hodeidah. The inhabitants, for the most part, are settled, and occupied in agricultural operations or trade ; the pastoral or nomadic people are few, comparatively speaking, for the conditions which favour the pastoral or Bedouin type, found in the neighbouring districts of Hejaz or Nejd, hardly exist. The bulk live, not in towns, hut in the close-set villages of the Yemen highlands ; there the extensive and intensive cultivation indicates a populous country-side, and in many localities the villages lie within hail of each other in a continuous series. As in the adjoining province of the Hadhramaut, the people are divided into four main classes (see p. 221 f.) viz. (1) the or Ashrdf, the descendants of the Prophet, forming a religious aristocracy ; (2) the Tribesmen or belonging to the Qahtan or original South Arabian stock, who form the bulk of the popula tion and are the only class habitually carrying arms ; (3) the trading classes ; and (4) the servile mostly of mixed African descent and including a number of Jews. The most prominent tribal groups of Yemen are distributed as follows : The Anis occupy a considerable district west of the Dhamar- San'a road, and have about 3,000 fighting men. The Zaranilc (JDhardniq), who dwell in the Tihamah and the maritime hills with their administrative centre at Beit el-Faqih, are a powerful and warlike tribe, now lawless and out of hand. They muster 10,000 fighting men, and one of their paramount chiefs-- Mohammed Yahya Eashik—has his head-quarters at Huseiniyan, 9 miles north of Zebid. The Zaranik tribesman has a crisp, shortPOPULATION 149 beard and keeps his hair straight under a tightly bound turban. He cares little for trade so long as his crops in the maritime range or his flocks in theTihamah hold good. The turbulence and raiding pro pensities of the Zaranik have practically put an end to the caravan- borne trade of a large part of the Tihamah plain—notably that of Beit el-Faqlh and Zebid—with Hodeidah, th?maritime capital. The Hdshid wa Bekil, a powerful and warlike confederation of tribes, inhabit the north-eastern portion of Yemen and the south eastern corner of Asir, their territory extending from almost the latitude of San'a to within a short distance of Sa'dah. They are probably, numerically, the strongest tribe in the district, and are said to be able to muster 50,000 fighting men. They are now reputed to be mostly of Asir sympathies: in any case the whole tribeship is unanimous in disliking Turkish rule. The Khauldn. A strong Zeidi tribe inhabiting the districts east and south of San'a. They are a settled and agricultural people, but have from 7,000 to 8,000 fighting men. The Beni Matar occupy territory north of the Anis and are a strong Zeidi tribe. The Muqdtil, between Menakhah and Mefhaq, can muster between 2,400 and 2,700 fighting men. The Quhrah. This numerous tribe inhabits the country between Wadis Sardud and Siham, from near Hodeidah almost to Baiil They can put from 3,000 to 4,000 fighting men in the field. The AM 8ha i ir form a considerable and peaceful tribe inhabiting much of the Wadi Bana of Southern Yemen. The Sukil inhabit the extensive coastal district east of the Kamaran Island and south of Loheia. They are hostile to the Quhrah. For numbers of fighting men see p. 505. ^ Wazdttribe occupies the district on the borderland of ariri r men ' n( * rt a east of Loheia. They are reported to be able j i muster from 1,500 to 3,000 fighting men. The general racial types, according to zone, are the following ; fcttik' i, ^ Tihamah. Along this belt the natives are slight in build and darkm complexion, and betray a strong negroid taint due itoJ 0 + ne S ro f ^ ave element.

On the mountain ranges and massifs of the plateau we find the true mountaineer type, taller and bigger limbed than the lowlander and of lighter complexion. There is no negroid taint in the Yemen hills, but there has been some amount of inter marriage (confined to the mechanical and menial classes) with women of the serf cla*s, possibly of Abyssinian or Persian origin. (3) The maritime hills which skirt the Tihamah are peopled by a type intermediate between (1) and (2) ; here one sees the swarthy complexion of the plainsmen, but without the negroid taint, except in the towns and large settlements, where the tribal types have been more merged. (4) Beyond the highlands, towards the south-west edge of the Great Red Desert, there is a taller race again, with every trace of Bedouin immigration which probably came from Jauf. These eastward dwellers are known collectively, by the Yemenis, as Ahl el-Mashriq, and they fear their dour fanaticism and fierce impetuous character.' The pastoral habit is predominant and the tribesman is of purer descent and perhaps more highly developed in stamina and intelligence than the tribal farmers of the plateau or of the plain. This superior intelligence is doubtless derived from the difficult, uncertain, and sometimes dangerous conditions of the shepherd's life, which tend to sharpen wits and to brace nerves and ihuscIgs The Jews are an interesting and prominent class in Yemen, but are only found in the towns and larger settlements of the highlands, where some entire villages are exclusively peopled by them, or where, as in the larger towns, they live in their own quarter, iney are mainly noted as craftsmen and have secured for themselves much tolerance, for they are recognized, by Turk and Arab alike, as an important and useful economic factor in the developmen o the country. At Menakhah, for example, the best smiths and carpenters are all Jews. Theirs is, however, in general, a rather harried existence, and now that the Imam's influence is coming to the fore and the Islamic code is in yogue their position may eventually be in jeopardy. They are subject to certain disabilities. Though not interfered with in their religious practices, they are not allowed to have schools or synagogues ; they assemble or worship at private houses and the children are taught at home. Nor may they build their houses more than two storeys nig • They are outwardly distinguished from the Arabs by then' dress —an ungirded tunic of print or cotton reaching only to the knees, a close-fitting skull-cap, and the absence of weapons. ej dress their hair in a peculiar manner in two plaits, or curls, nangi gPOPULATION 151 down on each cheek. They are not allowed to ride in the town, and even outside they must dismount when passing a Moslem. But it would not be correct to describe them (at least for the present) as a persecuted community ; the law has been administered fairly with regard to them and, being remarkably industrious, they are on the whole prosperous and contented. Nevertheless, of late years there has been a tendency among them to emigrate—largely, it appears, to Jerusalem. Every male adult pays a capitation tax of one riyal. In religion the Central Yemen follows the Zeidi sect, an offshoot of the Shiah, called after Zeid, a great-grandson of 'Ali, and estab lished in the Yemen by the Imam Hadi Yahya, a.d . 901. Through him the present Imam of Yemen claims descent from 'Ali, the fourth Khalif, by his wife Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet. The Zeidis approach the orthodox Sunni more nearly, perhaps, than any other sect of the Shiah. The dwellers on the eastern plateau are all Sunnis, or orthodox Moslems, regarding the Sunna (a collection of traditions of the Prophet) as canonical, and guiding their conduct thereby. There is no love lost between these two great sects in Yemen. In the Tihamah the Sunni doctrine is also paramount ; at Hodeidah, however, a few Zeidis from up-country may be found. The creed and practices of Sunni extend in some parts (Hajeilah, for instance) some distance back into the maritime range. The Yemeni is not regarded as particularly fanatical: he sees the sects into which his own people are divided, and, maybe, realizes that there are at least two sides to every question. Hence his not unfriendly attitude to the Jews. Domestic Life and Appliances In describing matters domestic in Yemen a sharp line must be drawn between the conditions of life among the littoral population and those of the highlands. In the lowlands pastoral clans range and settle as grazing and water dictate. The black goat-hair tents of the more inland desert- dwellers are rarely seen ; the natives here raise huts of matting on poles, with an entrance covered by a piece of matting, but with no other aperture. Furniture is extremely scant and light so that movement may be easy—one or two wooden beds laced with palm cord, a few gourds for sour milk, some conical-lidded baskets for stores, a primitive hookah made out of an empty coco-nut, and152 \ YEMEN several vessels of crude green-glazed earthenware complete the domestic apparatus. One family one hut is the rule, with no attempt to separate the sexes. Food rarely includes meat, and the staple dietary consists of round, flat, unleavened cakes eaten with liquid butter or sesame oil, and dates. Corn is not ground by querns of the ordinary type, which would be heavy to carry : it is moistened and then crushed on a concave stone with a stone pestle grasped with both hands and rubbed to and fro—a process requiring much effort and patience and usually performed by the young girls when they are not engaged in bringing water from the often distant well. The favourite beverage is a liquor made of coffee-husks, ginger, and cardamon. A stew of meat, made in an earthen jar, with a plentiful addition of howaig, a mixture of condiments—pepper corns, cinnamon, and nutmeg—is a favourite dish. The Yemen Arabs drink ' coffee ' made of the husk rather than of the bean. The husks locally fetch a higher price than the berry, and in taste the beverage, known as qishr, is said to remind one of hot barley- water. Clothes are unusually scanty in this torrid climate. The charac teristic dress of the men is a coloured cotton kilt, belted round the waist, and the sole garment of the boys is a piece of cotton fabric. Females of all classes wear a long slip of navy-blue cotton, which they also sleep in, merely removing their necklaces of beads, and covering their feet with the shawl which serves as a hood during the day. Along the inner edge of the Tihamah and among the foot-hills, where more settled agricultural pursuits are followed, little, stone, tower-like huts, gathered in scattered groups, take the place of mat huts ; but food, clothing, and habits are not dissimilar to those of the plain. The Yemen is much plagued with mosquitoes in the lowlands, and with fleas and scorpions in the highlands. In the highlands native life contrasts very sharply with that prevailing in the lowlands ; cultivable spots are much more exten sive and frequent, and fixed settlements become the rule. All vil lages are fortresses in themselves ; they are often perched, eyi ie like, on hills at the very edge of awesome abysses, and many well away from any recognized route. All the towns and villages have certain features in common : they stand usually on a difficult crest of bare rock, from which rises a lofty rampart of towers, the gaps between being joined by curtains of stone masonry, and the keep of the chieftain rears its battlements above all. Even villages have their massive main gates ; the streets, usually steep, are often of slipperyDOMESTIC LIFE AND APPLIANCES 153 ... rock and bordered by loopholed houses and towers. The only ' ''b civilians are the artisan, mechanical, and servile classes. The houses in general are either entirely stone-built, or have l .jni| at least the lower storeys of well-hewn stone (dark basalt), fitted ''ten together without mortar, with the superstructure of sun-dried brick. 111 di The larger houses are very tall and have a tendency to taper upwards, often giving them the appearance of truncated pyramids. The fa9ades are usually of stucco, whitewashed, and ornamented with the frapi chevron pattern. They are rambling structures, with bewildering ins mik passages and spiral stone staircases, and have tiny casements adorned with stained glass, and loopholes everywhere in the lower stories. The interiors are usually arranged in long, narrow rooms with many windows. All large houses have massive embossed doors of acacia wood, with solid wickets set in them, the latter so arranged that HIii the bolt can be raised from above. The dwellings of the wealthy loftkk are sometimes well, not to say luxuriously, furnished. The dress of the Yemen Arabs is peculiar to themselves. The of lot if town-bred natives of San'a wear silk robes, girdled at the waist, large white turbans, and square-toed sandals. Nearly all carry . Hetk a shoulder-cloth, which they wrap around their heads in cold Itedreir weather, and they seldom wear the The costume is : cottOEi supposed to denote an educated man, which, in their eyes, means fottou i; one versed in the religious law, but in practice it is assumed by any one who can afford it. The dress of the countryman, the moun taineer, and the poorer classes of townspeople is more striking and picturesque. It consists of a black turban fastened in a peculiar manner, a black skirt reaching to the knees, with sleeves as wide as j Pd the skirt itself, and over it, in full dress, a coloured loin-cloth and a most voluminous sash. The cloths are made in the Yemen, and, , [j^j. though coarse, are very strong. The dye is indigo and is not fast: it is not supposed nor required to be. They like to smear it off over their faces and hands, and this, with their long black curls carefully oiled, sometimes gives them an extraordinary appearance. The Turkish women are dressed in black and thickly veiled. The Arab 11 T f women are wrapped in coloured cloths and are closely veiled in e ' towns. In the country they go uncovered, and in some parts they I Europe. Boots, of red or yellow colour, not sandals, are usually 'in wear trousers, in shape not unlike that part of male attire in Western •worn. t# '^ e wea P on of the Yemen highlander is the a short ' dagger with a broad curved blade, which fits into a V-shaped sheath lie W' worn at the waist. The handle is generally of horn ornamented jwith silver, and the whole, including the blade, is made locally.154 YEMEN No male over three years old would be seen abroad without his jambiyah. The Arabs are very expert in its use ; they hold it point downward and curve inward, and in attacking always aim for the suprasternal notch, a blow which, if rightly placed, splits open the whole chest-wall, and is instantly fatal. Another weapon is the sabikah, nearly as long as a sword-bayonet and worn crossways in the belt; this latter needs a powerful man to wield it effectively. Cooking utensils are often of copper or brass, and are skilfully made ; copper- and brass-working was formerly much practised, at San'a in particular, but the art has declined in recent years. Agriculture akd Industries The inhabitants of Yemen being settled and in great part occu pied in cultivation, the conditions which favour the pastoral or Bedouin type hardly exist except in the littoral plain. Yemen has always been noted for its agriculture and general fertility; but this refers chiefly to the highlands and the central plateau—not to the maritime ranges, nor to the Tihamah, which is mostly desert except where great wadis cut their way through to the sea. The principal crops of the region as a whole are coffee, maize, red and white millet, bearded wheat and barley, sesame, indigo, and cotton. The distribution of crops, according to zone, is much as follows : The Tihamah is, in the main, sterile and saline, but gardens may be maintained near some of the larger seaports by constant irriga tion, while farther inland towards the foot-hills there are broad arable tracts formed of detritus brought down from the heights. The crops of this belt are red and white millet, maize, sesame, and, around Beit el-Faqih and Zebid, a small amount of cotton and indigo. These crops, as a whole, depend on the spring rains and will ripen three months after sowing. On the inner edge of the Tihamah, where they get the margin of the summer storms, as many as three crops of millet can be obtained from one sowing. Among the hills of the maritime range little cultivation is possible (except in valleys of considerable size where flood water comes down and can be utilized) ; the country is well bushed, but there is little soil to cultivate, the surface-drainage water is not enough for irrigation purposes, and the population is scanty. The crops, such as they are, are grown in the spring, as the rain falls in the foot-hills in April. Millet is the staple crop, with maize and sesame next in importance ; and grass grows plentifully after rain. The highland zone (though the soil is not naturally so fertile asAGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIES 155 the lowlands and must be artificially renewed from time to time) is the most productive of Yemen, the rainfall, as shown in a previous section, being more abundant and regular, and the inhabitants, comparatively speaking, more virile, active, and industrious. The staple production is coffee ; then follow bearded wheat and barley, and fodder and garden produce. Coffee, as an Arabian crop, is peculiar to the Yemen highlands. The plant flourishes at any altitude between 4,000 and 8,000 ft., and is first met between Hodeidah and San'a soon after leaving Hajeilah. It is not indigenous to Arabia, but was introduced from Abyssinia during the Ethiopian invasion before the dawn of Islam. The berries used for seed are first placed in the sun to dry until the husk cracks of itself and can be easily opened, care being taken in so doing not to injure the inner skin of the bean. To produce young plants the farmer selects a patch of ground free from stones with at least one foot of good soil : he damps this and smooths it down, presses each bean to a depth of a few inches in the prepared ground, and covers them with a further inch or so of loose fine soil. Artificial shade is then provided, usually of branches, leaving an aperture at the top so that sunlight may fall for an hour or so daily on each part of the planted surface. The bed is watered every two or three days and the shoots appear in about a month. The seedlings may be planted out about four months after they appear; the plant reaches maturity in five years, attaining a height of from 8 to 10 ft., and is too old to be profitable after about twenty years. The plantations are laid out in terraces up the hill-sides and following their curves ; these are faced with stones, sometimes en closing a strip only a few feet wide and sometimes an acre or so ; the soil is often only a foot or two deep. Great care has to be taken to prevent the destruction of the terraces by accidental water courses caused by thunderstorms. Every accessible and suitable spot on the mountain-side is utilized. Many terraces were constructed centuries ago, and they give a peculiar and charac teristic aspect to the Yemen landscape. The watering is done Kjtti from cisterns of cemented masonry, built in every cleft or ravine iei l ; t where surface water can be intercepted—for this reason some j s!) (itJ centres are comparatively sterile and devoid of plantations, as Us cisterns are not practicable. The harvest, broadly speaking, is in ^fjii autumn, but the berries ripen at different intervals according to jjjuJ; their position on the tree and the amount of sun to which a planta tion is exposed. The Haraz district, west of Menakhah, produces coffee of the highest quality, and that grown by the Anis and156 YEMEN Beni Matar is also well known. Ta'izz is the centre of the southern coffee districts. Coffee is undoubtedly still the most important crop of the Yemen, in spite of prices dropping owing to the competition of Brazil and the present insecurity and difficulties of transport. Local con sumption is enormous, but the thrifty Arabs use (and seem to prefer) the husk and keep the berry for market. The outlets for the marketable berries are Hodeidah and Aden, but increasingly the latter in consequence of the comparatively greater security of the routes to Aden. The other main crops of the highlands are barley, bearded wheat, millet, vegetables, and The latter calls for a passing notice. The plant resembling the spindle-tree, is cultivated in Yemen over limited areas in such districts as suit it, at an altitude of about 5,000 ft. It is tended with zealous care in walled enclosures, and is perhaps the most ■profitable of all the Yemen products. The tender leaves and twigs are the valuable parts of the plant, and are chiefly in demand. The natives chew these for their exhilarant and stimulant properties, and the habit is almost universal among the inhabitants of this part of Arabia. The only implements used by the highland farmer are a hoe, a mattock, a reed basket (the latter for transporting soil), and an empty kerosene tin for watering purposes. As to the crops farther eastward of the plateau, the country here becomes less and less fertile, 'and cultivation gives way almost entirely to pastoral occupations. The farmers of Yemen in general are guided as to seasons by the stars. They watch, for example, the movement of the Pleiades for the spring activities : the Arabs call it (from a word meaning wealth), and when the cluster swings low in the west he knows the spring rains are at hand; or, when he sees Aldebaran on the western skyline at dusk, he starts his ploughing, for the spring rains have then set in and the ground is soft enough for the plough or the mattock. Produce has to be transported from the farms by hand, or in absurdly small loads on donkeys, in consequence of the extreme difficulty in negotiating some of the mountain paths, often the merest footholds. When it has been carried to a main caravan route, the husbandman is then faced by the exorbitant cost of transport, often further enhanced by difficulty in obtaining fodder. The caravan routes too are beset by marauders, more especially towards the coast, where the best, though remote, markets lie. Faced by such obstacles, production is often restricted to local requirements. Yemen is fertile enough and will produce mostAGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIES 157 generous harvests, yet that it is not self-supporting seems to be shown by the fact that it imports more than £100,000 worth of food-stuffs even in years of plenty. This condition, however, is probably due not to natural causes, nor even to individual sloth, but to lack of security and co-operation, for which the political unrest is mainly responsible. A sound system of collecting surface drainage would also give a great impetus to agricultural production. Most industries, other than agriculture, in Yemen, are either moribund or languish from various causes, but in former days they were not unimportant. The following remnant local industries are the only ones worth mentioning ; (1) Dyeing. The indigo plant is still cultivated round Zebid and Beit el-Faqih, but the dyeing which was formerly carried on at these places has been dislocated by tribal disturbance (of the Zaranik in particular), and the industry has been transferred to Hodeidah, where indigo-dyeing had already been practised on a smaller scale. There it continues to maintain itself in spite of an increasing tendency to use synthetic dyes. (2) Weaving. There is a colony of weavers at Hodeidah, many of whom have come from the disturbed area just mentioned. They weave a coarse cotton cloth in stripes of colour, which is retailed in lengths suitable for shawls, &amp;c., as worn by the natives. Ta'izz was once famous for weaving, but is much less so now than formerly. (3) Boat-building. The building of is carried on at some small yards along the beach south of Hodeidah. The Yemen dhow or sanbuq —used for transporting cargo to and from vessels in the roadstead—is about 50 ft. long and sharp prowed. It has a short sturdy mast, which carries a big lateen sail on an almost perpendicular gaff of great length and well tapered. The rudder is operated by tiller-ropes leading direct to it, well below the water- line, from either gunnel. Such a craft takes about three months to build and costs £100. The stem and stern posts and the knees and ribs are made of up-country acacia, which is very hard and durable, but the planking com^s from the Malabar coast. Sea going dhows are built on the same lines, but larger, with a small mizzen-mast well aft, and also lateen rigged. They have decks fore and aft; passengers berth aft, under an awning on the raised poop. They are outlandish-looking vessels, but very seaworthy, as they need to be on this windy coast. (4) Tanning. Hides are dressed and made into sandals at Hodeidah, Zebid, Beit el-Faqih, and some other centres. Sheep skins are also soft-tanned in some of the larger up-country centres^158 YEMEN chiefly for making into boots, which are there more often worn than sandals because of the cold. (5) Milling. There is a small flour-mill at Menakhah, built by the Turks ; otherwise grinding is done entirely by the hand-quern. (6) Metal-working. San'a was once famous for its ornamental work in brass and copper ; the industry is now confined to the making of domestic utensils in these metals, and is still carried on in the main at the same place. (7) Production of minerals. There is a small amount of coarse brittle native iron, but the scarcity of fuel makes smelting imprac ticable. Petroleum has long been known to exist in the Farsan (Farasdn) Islands, and a concession was granted to an Ottoman subject, but the results of the experimental borings were of doubtful value. Rock-salt occurs at Salif on the mainland opposite Kamaran Island, and the flourishing salt-works there are under the control of the Ottoman Public Debt : the bulk of the salt goes to India, but large quantities are also sent inland. Fine stones of onyx, agate, chalcedony, and cornelian are found in the hills round San'a. Trade The trade of Yemen has declined in recent years, for reasons already stated. The only port of any real importance commercially is Hodeidah, but even there, before the war, trade was not as brisk as formerly. Aden proved to be a surer outlet for products, largely in consequence of the fact that the caravan-routes leading thither were less liable to tribal disturbances and raids, with the result that nearly all the coffee went there. Mocha, once the centre of the coffee trade, no longer holds any position as a trading port. The other local coasting and fishing villages, from north to south, are Ghulei- flqah. Gab (a landing-place for slaves), Mersa el-Majalis (a good harbour for small boats), and Musa. In 1909 the value of imports at Hodeidah was £650,000, and that of exports £400,000. The chief articles of export—in fact the only worth considering—are hides, skins, coffee, and fuller's earth ; coffee was the mainstay, but is now ousted by hides and skins. For coffee, France is the best customer, then the United States, with Great Britain as a bad third. Hides and skins (the latter largely from Asir) go chiefly to New York, Marseilles, and London. By far the most important imports are cereals, rice, and other food-stuffs from India ; and, a long way behind these, sheetings, cotton piece-goods, and yarn from the United States and Manchester,TRADE 159 Miltkt omit inedt#! Icmi ntof# petroleum from the United States and Russia, iron and steel for smithy purposes from Germany (before the war), general stores from Italy and (?) Austria, and silk and condiments. Imports pay an 11 % ad valorem duty, of which 8 % may be paid in kind, but with a rebate of 10 % if cash is paid ; the remaining 3 % must be paid in cash, without rebate. Exports pay 1 % duty either in cash or in kind. Currency Currency in Yemen is in a chaotic state : little information regarding it is available, but it appears that both the coins current colli anc i their exchange value vary greatly at different times and in ateui different localities. Bury says : ' Before the affairs of the Yemen r® 1 - can be placed on a sound commercial basis, her currency and customs must be overhauled ; both are enough to drive a brisk ''J business man frantic/ Wavell says : 'A more hopeless muddle than the present condition of the Turkish currency (in the Yemen) would be difficult to conceive. It is different wherever one goes, and the value of the principal coins fluctuates daily. There are about a dozen different coins in common use, none of which is exactly divisible into a whole number of the next smallest.' . lots Gold.

Of the highlands (second to fifth zones), the southern part, from about 'Amran, is under a condominium, the Turks having the supreme military and administrative control, but the Imam retain ing legal powers, religious and civil (see later), which amount to a social jurisdiction. In the northern part, from about ' Amran up to the Asir border, the Imam's is the only paramount power, but it is impaired by the sturdy independence of certain great tribes, especially the Hashid and Bekll, and the influence of Idrisi of Asir. On the eastern plateau no law runs but that of the local chiefs of the Jauf, Mareb, and other oases, the Beni Yam controlling Nejran. The Turks, who first established themselves in Yemen early in the sixteenth century, lost their hold on the highlands a hundred years later ; and these, falling into the hands of the Zeidi Imams of Sa'dah, who had previously been supreme in the north only, remained independent till well on into the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Tihamah also passed out of Turkish power a little later, and throughout the eighteenth century was ruled in the main by its own local sheikhs, under a vague suzerainty exercised by the Imams from San'a which was hardly effective except in Mocha. But in 1819 Mohammed 'Ali of Egypt occupied the coast towns, and prepared the way for the resumption of direct Turkish rule. In consequence of the efforts of Sherif Husein of Abu 'Arish in S. Asir to dominate the Tihamah after the withdrawal of the Egyptians in 1840, a Turkish expeditionary force under Tewfik Pasha appeared in Yemen in 1849, retook Hodeidah and other parts of the Tihamah from Sherif Husein, and advanced on to the highlands. But though it entered, it was unable to retain San'a, and it was not till 1872, when the Imams had displayed their incompetence to govern for nearly a quarter of a century longer, that the Turks established themselves in the central highlands on an invitation from the notables of the capital itself. The Imam, Ghalib el-Hadi, was sent into retirement on a pension, and the titular rulers remained in obscurity for twenty years. The Tihamah and central and southern highlands were constituted as a vilayet, which nominally extended northwards to the Hejaz border; but the only part north of 'Amran effectively held or really administered by the Turks was the central part and, coast-line of Asir, all the intervening highland region, about Khamir and Sa'dah, remaining in fact independent. Turkish efforts to 'hold the oases of the eastern plateau resulted in no permanent occupation. They also made intermittent but ineffective attempts arabia 1 , 1162 YEMEN to extend their rule southwards into the Aden hinterland as certain a* Imams had done before them. The head centre of Ottoman fe* 0 ' government was San'a, where the Vali and C. in C. resided. Under e *' it were four Sanjaqs, the Merkaz (San'a), Asir, Hodeidah, and if 1 ® Ta'izz governed by Mutessarifs. The three of these lying in Yemen W® proper were divided into twenty-one Loheia, Haju, Zeidiyah, J* 1 Bajil, Beit el-Faqih, Mocha ; Haj, Suda, Tawilah, Dhoran, Reimah, mW Zebid, 'Udeir, Ibb, Hajariyah ; Hajjah (Haddah), An is, Dhamar, «■» Rada', Yerim, and Qa'tabah. ■'I' Never long quiet under alien rule, impatient of taxation, and iW disgusted at the spectacle of their lands falling out of cultivation We, and trade passing to Aden, the Yemenis, especially the highlanders, ifttoll gave continual trouble to the Turks. In 1891 a great rising (the jilpaii first of a series) took place, but was suppressed after a costly Mi campaign and San'a was wrested from the rebels by Ahmed Peizi fotpst Pasha. Yahya Hamid ed-Din, though the revolt was made in aiU his name, fled on its actual outbreak to Sa'dah, leaving the head- Mfte ship of the fighting forces to his cousin, Ahmed esh-Shera'i. (nAir Another general rising followed in 1904 on the death of the Imam, Mohammed el-Mansur (son of Yahya Hamid ed-Din, who skgit had never been recognized as Imam), and the accession of his son, He tr Yahya. San'a capitulated through famine, and all the posts inland pemi of Menakhah surrendered to the rebels, who took more than seventy Tie j pieces of artillery and a considerable quantity of small arms and amjnunition. Ahmed Feizi Pasha, who had shown such firmness Bittti and ability in the previous rising, returned from Basra to command cfiitiiry, the expeditionary column which had been collected on the coast, iteen fought his way to San'a and re-established order, but only after Wass a great expenditure of blood and money. The Imam, however, otSani] utterly refused to surrender any of the weapons and stores he had ^o'ta, captured, and it was only by the Turks giving way on this point that a patched-up peace was made. _ JWs In 1911 San'a (under Mohammed' Ali Pasha) was again beleaguered Samsl by the insurgent tribes in the name of the Imam Yahya. Tzzet Pasha, ie oi^ who relieved the place and became military governor, inaugurated uipn^ a rapprochement with the Imam, for he saw that the military difficu - ties of the situation demanded some such policy, if Turkey was to si?kit preserve even nominal sovereignty in Yemen. For a long time 'ftiotl® the Porte refused to consider the measure, and 'Izzet returned o io| {t j Stambul in order to press his views, leaving Mahmud Nazim l&gt;ey (a civilian) to carry on negotiations with the Imam. 'illy Tzzet Pasha attained his aim at Stambul, and an Impend Firman was read publicly at San'a on September 22, 1913, pi 0 'UjlfljRECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 163 claiming a ' mediatized status ' or with the Imam, ' for the sake of peace between Moslems'. The terms of this Firman established that, in Yemen, civil and criminal law should be no longer based on the Turkish judicial code, or ' Qanun ', but on the old Islamic code or 'Sheri'ah', and that this code should be administered by nominees of the Imam, who drew a substantial inEa annual subsidy for himself and his vassal chiefs (L.T. 1,000 liUfc mensem for his own Civil List and L.T. 1,500 in addition for his vassal chiefs). Under this entente the Imam has the religious and axati social control in all the Zeidi districts (i. e., roughly, the highlands rtcis from the Asir border to that of the Aden hinterland, together with ehijlk a part of the inner central Tihamah); and he appoints and removes atrii judges and magistrates, subject to the veto of the Ottoman authority, litens The Zeidi districts pay no tithe, and no one is liable to punishment Mil for past acts of rebellion under the Imam's flag. ' Octroi' and fasi transit duties have been abolished. Now the only taxes levied viigtt (and these only when opposition is not too great) are the tithes Steal {'ushur in non-Zeidi districts) on agricultural produce and stock ; (b) market dues (10 % on all produce sold, 1 P.T. for every goat slaughtered and 10 P.T. for every bullock); and (c) customs dues. The tribesmen under the Imam are exempt from taxation, but give military service instead if called upon. The Imamate, which dates back to the establishment of the . inl |]}, E ; Rassite dynasty at Sa'dah in the tenth century, but only became 511t yi more than a local power under the Imam Qasim in the seventeenth Kjg century, has a great prestige in Yemen : but the faith of the people has been much undermined by the incompetence and venality of holders of the office, and the treacherous though abortive betrayal of San'a in 1849 by the Imam Mohammed Yahya has not been forgotten. The direct influence of the Imams is confined almost ; entirely to the Zeidist districts of Yemen. On the coast and in the isyw highlands of the Aden hinterland, where the population is pre dominantly Sunnite of the Shafei school, it goes for little or nothing. The office is elective, like the Ibadhi Imamate in Oman ; but, hy a ^ in practice, a son of the last Imam is usually, and a scion of the mor 1 original Rassite stock is invariably, preferred. In recent elections e® there has been a good deal of intrigue and substitution of one house i for another. The Qasim family of Sheharah is at present in power, For but other houses, e.g. the Hadi Lidin Allah and the Shehari, hold Izzet ■ themselves equally entitled to it. Once elected, the Imam becomes essentially a sacred personage, and, for some generations back, the 0. .holder of the title has lived more or less in seclusion, a mysterious and ' being, little seen by the people, though, behind the veil, more than iber ^164 YEMEN one Imam has been notoriously addicted to very secular vices. To this Shiite conception of their office the Imams owe it that they have never obtained the dominant position among Moslems accorded to the Sherifs of Mecca. 2. Recent Yahya ibn Mohammed el-Mansur ibn Yahya, Imam since 1904, is now (1916) about 46 years of age. When he accepted the media tized status in 1913, and Khamir became the Imamite capital, he took up his residence in the fortress of Sheharah, about two days north of 'Amran, and admitted Turkish garrisons both there and at Khamir. Having been friendly with Mahmud Nazim Pasha, he became anti-Turk after the latter's supersession, and disapproved of the attack on Aden in 1915 as an infringement of his prerogative. On the whole he has been hostile to the Ottoman military rule in Yemen. Though bound by his position to administer the Sheri 'ah and maintain a religious character, Yahya is more lax in observance than his father, and lives less in religious seclusion. He appears to take no very active part in government, beyond receiving reports from his nominees and adherents, and is said to be an intelligent man of honest character, but somewhat weak and yielding, who has not much hold over the Zeidist tribesmen of the north and of the highlands of Central Yemen. He is strongly opposed to Idrisi, and is considered unlikely either to head another revolt or to enter into relations with England. But he could, on occasion, marshal and arm a large force, and he has (as pointed out above) guns and munitions. He has again inclined towards the Turks since Mahmud Nazim Pasha returned in October 1915, and, in November, he wrote a complimentary letter to Enver praying for the success of the Ottoman armies. Since then he has kept fairly quiet, refusing to be drawn by the Sherif into an active alliance with himself, and still less into one with Idrisi, though he has kept, more or less faithfully, a truce with the latter since the autumn of 1915. His chief activity has been to send emissaries and troops into the NE. Aden hinterland (spring 1916) to endeavour to win over the tribes of the Beida and 'Aulaqi districts to his suzerainty, and to tamper with those of the Hadhramaut. But the attempt does not appear to have met with much success and it has been abandoned. The serious economic position o Yemen, and probable failure of his own subsidy, may be expects to affect his pro-Turk feelings before long ; and already rumoursRECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 165 of his having adopted a contumacious attitude towards his pro tectors are in circulation. His philo-Turk attitude lost him some time ago his hold on the Hashidi and Bekil tribesmen, and im paired his position in other districts. He appears lately to have sought a closer understanding with the Sherif of Mecca, and an alliance between these two against Idrisi and the Turks is not out of the question. Districts and Towns The towns of Yemen proper are here described in their two main groups, highland and lowland, followed by a section on the outlying districts of Jauf and Nejran, with their respective settlements. 1. Yemen The highland towns contrast strongly in general character with those on the lowlands and plains : the former are almost entirely stone-built, with solid fortress-like houses, and as a rule occupy elevated, commanding positions, whilst in the latter less solid and resistant materials enter into their construction. The highland towns are the following : 1. San'a, the old capital of the Imams, Ottoman capital, and residence of the Vali of Yemen, is situated about 100 miles crow-fly ENE. of Hodeidah, on a broad, open plain, 7,750 ft. above sea-level. The plain has an almost imperceptible slope towards the north, and is surrounded by low, barren hills, of which the highest eminence i is Jebel Nuqum, 1,000 ft. in elevation. The crest of this hill is surmounted by a Turkish fort and observation post with two big gaccesd howitzers which command the town ; the fort lies distant some two hours' journey up a steep winding track. The town is divided into three distinct quarters : the old Arab .isinto® ^ own proper, containing the shops and Government buildings; tmceiil tlie el-'Azab, on the west, a spacious suburb of modern «te!i: °ffici_al and private residences and walled gardens; and the Qa'at el- ^ or quarter, to the west again. The old town is Vl# surroun ded by a 40-ft. wall of stone and mud, flanked with ancient HaJif ^? wers frequent intervals,to which the Turks have in more modern ! iili ~ lmes a( ided certain defences at the gates, notably the sally port # ^ ie citadel, a zigzag outlet of massive strength through which micf there is no public admittance. The original town wall has been i' 1 j, ex tended in modern times to include two newer quarters, the166 YEMEN whole having a perimeter of from 7 to 8 miles. The old wall is a formidable work, but much out of repair, surmounted by a parapet with loopholes for musketry ; the extension built by the Turks could almost be kicked down in places. There are eight gates in all. The Bab esh-Sha'ub in the north wall is the main way f&gt;5 ingress for the market traffic ; the Bab el-Yemen, opposite, is the one through which flows the caravan traffic towards Dhamar, Yerim, Ibb, and Ta'izz ; the Bab es-Sabah, strategically the most impor tant, consists of three separate gates so arranged as to close effec tively the narrow neck that joins the Bir el-'Azab quarter to the main town ; and the Bab el-Qa'ah or Bab el-Yahud, leading from the Jews' quarter, and guarded by police and soldiers, is the exit for Hodeidah and the coast. There are several outlying fortified posts on the spurs of the surrounding hills which help to guard the city from surprise. At the eastern angle of the town is the Qal'ah (citadel), a con siderable pile covering several acres, on a slight but not very com manding elevation ; its guns are merely a saluting battery. In the Arab quarter, in addition to the Government offices, are situated the post and telegraph office; the barracks, handsome stone buildings, lie south of the town, outside the walls ; and near the norther nm ost gate, the Bab es-Sabah, is situated the well-equipped military hospital. The Midan esh-Sherara is the city square, having the residence of the Vali in a vast walled garden on one side of it and the Government school for resident scholars on another. There are many mosques, both Arab and Turkish, the principal Arab one, once a church, having considerable archi tectural merit; its court is surrounded by a high wall with colon nades in the inner side, and in the middle is a small cubical building known as the lesser Ka'bah and somewhat resembling the Ka'bah at Mecca. The Turkish mosque is known as the Bakili. The bazaars of the native quarter call, architecturally, for no special notice : they are plentifully stocked with local food produce, especially almost every variety of fruit and vegetables, but other wise almost entirely with goods of European origin, with the excep tion of a few objects of native brass and copper work. The Jewish quarter has its own bazaar, and there are some fairly good shops. The streets in the native quarter are mostly narrow and sombre, owing to the height of the houses ; in the Jewish quarter the houses are of mud, not more than two storeys in height (see p. 150), and closely packed together. The water of San'a is good and plentiful; a perennial stream runs through the plain, and there are, in addition, many good wells hotis DISTRICTS AND TOWNS 167 within and without the walls. The purest source is a spring on the lower slopes of Jebel Nuqum, to which it is worth while to send for water for drinking purposes. A stream called the also rises from a spring within the city and flows out under the north wall round Jebel Nuqum, eventually joining the Kharid (p. 147). Along the course of this stream, towards the north, is the largest tract of well-irrigated and cultivated land round San'a, extending to Raudhah, a populous settlement, 5 miles away, famous for its grapes in particular (the pride of San'a), and for all kinds of fruit and other produce, whence the town market is well supplied. There are other considerable tracts of fertile soil in the neighbourhood, and the country is dotted with clumps of trees, chiefly tamarisk. In spite of its good water-supply and high altitude, San'a is far from a healthy town, the inhabitants suffering from fevers and a form of anaemia. But the heat is never excessive even in summer, and in winter the temperature is most agreeable. Manzoni gives the following thermometric observations : November, mean maxi mum 70° Fahr., mean minimum 52° ; January 62° and 40°; March 73° and 52°. The population is very variously estimated : Harris in 1891 computed it at 50,000, Manzoni in 1880 at about 25,000, the con sular report for 1905 gives it as 20,000, and Wavell in 1911 as 18,000 : in any case the chronic commercial depression and the number of empty houses (remarked by various authorities), seem to indicate a rapidly decreasing population. About 6,000 (according to one authority) are Jews ; of other non-Moslem aliens there are now few, most of them having left owing to the general unrest and commercial depression. Manzoni gives 20,000 Arabs, 3,000 Turks, and 1,700 Jews. 2. Menakhah lies 7,500 ft. above sea-level, on the Hodeidah- San'a road, about 40 miles crow-fly from the latter. In addition to occupying a naturally strong site on a mountain massif, the town is a collection of forts and stone-built fortress-like houses. Harris says of it: ' Of all the places it has ever been my lot to see, this is the most wonderfully situated. The town is perched on a narrow strip of mountain which joins two distinct ranges, and forms the watershed of two great valleys. So narrow is the ridge on which the town stands that the walls of the houses on both sides seem almost to hang over a precipice.' The streets are steep and often lead over bare and slippery rock—in some instances they resemble badly constructed staircases. The ridge on which the town stands is formed by an offshoot from Jebel Shibam, and the place is guarded by a number of outstanding forts and armed posts which occupy168 YEMEN the heights around ; of these the two principal are forts Hadar (or Heidar) and Beh (with one or more heavy howitzers), both situated on the south-east, and commanding the town as well as the approaches to it. The town and district are strongly garrisoned, and are administered by a Kaimmakam, whose jurisdiction extends from Hajeilah to Suq el-Khamis. The population of Menakhah is about 7,000, including 1,000 Jews. The place would be well able to withstand siege, for fertile gardens with good crops overhang the precipices which fall sheer from the town on one side, and orchards and fields of fodder cover the slopes of Jebel Shibam on the other. The military hospital is at the upper end of the town, and somewhat lower down are the tall oblong barracks and magazine; the Government buildings, Hukumah, and post office are substantial buildings ; all these are supplied with very excellent water by a covered conduit leading from a good spring in a ravine in Jebel Shibam. There are also several other perennial springs of good water which afford an adequate supply to the rest of the town. 3. Ta'izz is situated at an elevation of 4,000 ft. above sea-level, in a valley of considerable fertility at the foot of Jebel Sabor (Sabar). The town, quadrilateral in plan, is surrounded by a wall from 25 to 30 ft. in thickness and from 10 to 12 ft. high, constructed in the main of sun-dried bricks, but with a layer of fire-baked bricks on the exterior, and having towers at intervals, which rise 8 or 10 ft. above the wall. The wall has five gates : the Bab el-Kebir, the great eastern gate leading to San'a and Mawiyah; the Bab Sheikh Musa, to Mocha and Hais ; the Bab 'Ain Dummah, towards Jebel Sabor and connecting the town with the Kahrah; and two others of less importance, one of which, according to Zwemer, has been walled up. The gates are defended by towers rising from the walls, and other towers cover the entrances. On a bare eminence, about 400 ft. in height, east-south-east of the town, is situated the Kahrah, a citadel-fortress with barracks, which commands the town and would be very formidable were it not itself commanded by the mountains round. The present population of Ta'izz probably does not reach 4,000 (Zwemer' s estimate is 5,000), but formerly it was a large city, owing its importance to its situation in the centre of a comparatively fertile district at the junction of several trade routes. Describing the town, Manzoni says : ' It is a mass of ruins ; mosques, houses, fortifications, all falling to pieces. Five mosques and ten so-called palaces, surrounded by three hundred low small houses (which form the inhabited quarter on the west side), are the only witnesses of its ancient importance. The remainder of the space enclosedDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 169 within the walls, to east and south, is cultivated or covered with ruins.' Near the Bab Sheikh Musa is the suq, or market, which is fairly well supplied with fresh vegetables, rice, butter, dates, bananas, lemons, and other fruits. The water is good and plentiful, and is brought into the town by pipes from Jebel Sabor. Ot the five main mosques, the Sherifiyah (now closed for worship) is rectangular and has three large ornamental cupolas and an ancient library of jumbled books and Arab commentaries (few complete) ; the Muzafferiyah, with three big cupolas and several small ones and three rows of columns supporting an ornamental vaulting, is in a good state of preservation and is the ' cathedral ' of Ta izz ; the Mukhdeblyah, a large square construction of mixed Arab architecture, is used as a military hospital. Outside the walls is the fine and well-preserved mosque of Sheikh Afdal. The climate is said to be unhealthy. Ta'izz is directly connected by telegraph with San'a and Mocha. 4. Yerim is built partly on level ground and partly on the slope of Jebel Samarah, at an elevation of over 7,000 ft. above sea-level, and is enclosed by strong walls with four gates, two towards the south, one east, and one west. It has a population of from 3,000 to 4,000. Harris says: 'Yerim is a poor enough looking place with a fortified entrance ; it has an open space which serves as a market. There is but little to see in the town, which is essentially a poor one, and although built partly on the slope of a mountain, where stone is procurable, the houses are almost entirely composed of sun-dried bricks. Dirt and squalor abound on every side, and the streets of narrow bazaars show no sign of any great commerce or trade. What little importance the place can lay any claim to is owing to the fact that it lies on the main road from San'a to Aden and is a garrisoned city.' Manzoni describes the houses as ' built either of stone or of furnace-baked bricks There is a separate Jewish quarter. The garrison is a small one in normal times. Telegraph to San'a and Ta'izz. 5. Dhamar, a large, scattered town, is situated in a flat plain some 20 m. north by east of Yerim, at an altitude of about 8,000 ft. above sea-level. It is not walled, as are most of the highland towns, but is more or less defended by a series of small and, for the most part, mud-built forts. There is a look of prosperity about the place, many of the houses being commodious and well built of stone, while in the centre of the town there is a wide and rather handsome open square. The Government offices are here, and, near the square, is the prin cipal mosque in a walled enclosure which may be entered by three large gates. The population of Dhamar is about 5,000, including170 YEMEN the Jews, who have a town entirely to themselves, separated from the native town by a large open space. The bazaars are notably picturesque, but boast little in the way of supplies ; there are two public baths, and the streets are comparatively clean. Manzoni speaks of Dhamar as ' having the most important theological college in Yemen, containing a fine Arab library' : it seems, in any case, to have been the seat of an ancient university. 6. Ibb is a walled town, of typical stone-built houses, on a ridge forming a pass, about 35 miles south by west of Yerim. The popu lation is about 4,000, and there is a small garrison. It is on the San'a-Ta'izz telegraph line, and has also a direct line of communi cation with Qa'tabah. 7. Qa'tabah, the chief Turkish frontier post, lies 81 miles NNW. of Aden, and consists of a few stone and many mud houses closely built together. A high mud wall at one time surrounded the town, but this has been broken down and disconnected on the north and east, and is now standing only on the south side. The principal buildings are a large white mosque and a flat-roofed, three-storeyed, stone-built house situated on the east side of the town, and used as a court-house by the Turks. The population consists of Arabs, Jews, and Turkish half-castes, numbering in all about 1,500. The fort, which lies half a mile to the NW., is a large rectangular building of two stories, the lower of good stonework with loopholes, the upper of mud ; to this adjoins a barrack. The normal garrison is about 250 men. 8. Khamir (Khamr), situated about 90 miles east by north of Loheia, is a large Hashid town at a high elevation at the head of Wadi Dhibin, and, for Yemen, is subject to an unusually cold, bleak climate. Little is known about the town, as it seems doubtful whether it has ever been visited by any European traveller, and it certainly has been described by none. It is the present capital of the Imam, and, since the establishment of the with the Turks, has been garrisoned by several battalions of troops. It has a busy weekly market. 9. Sheharah, the hill-fort of the Imam (also garrisoned by Turks), lies about 20 (?) miles south of Khamir, in the wild Hashid country, whose fighting tribes admit neither his nor any other authority except under constant pressure. 10. Raudhah is a considerable town noted for its extensive gardens; it lies about 5 miles north of San'a, with which it is connected by a carriage-road. It is a grape-growing centre. There was no garrison in 1913. 11. 'Amran lies about 30 (?) miles south of Khamir, and is theDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 171 northern limit of effective Ottoman rule.' It is a considerable town of unknown population, and is garrisoned. . „ 12 Sa'dah, the northernmost Yemen town, is the tocus ot Zeidism and original seat of the Imams. It has supported them even against the Hashid. Nothing certain is known of its appear ance or size. The principal lowland towns are the following : 1. Hodeidah, the only port of Yemen having any considerable commercial importance, is situated on the Red Sea in lat. 14 47 N. It has no quay nor wharfage, nor any of the conveniences of a trading port, and the old, primitive wooden pier has fallen into decay. There is a small harbour, available only for the smallest craft, with two projecting moles of stone (each with a light about 15 ft. high at the end), a breakwater, and two entrances, of which the northern is slightly the easier of access. After the moles were constructed it was found that the water was not deep enough to allow loaded lighters to come alongside, so the stevedores have to wade, and merchandise for shipment, or just landed, is dumped down on the beach. Large vessels anchor about 2-| miles off in four fathoms ; merchandise is transferred in native craft. Landing is difficult and, at times, impossible with the wind between south and west. A few years ago the Ottoman Government conceived a scheme for con structing a harbour for Hodeidah, about 10 miles to the north, where there is a deep natural inlet protected by a long spit known as Ras el-Kethib ; this was part of a larger undertaking known as the Hodeidah-San'a Railway scheme. The harbour was to be linked up with Hodeidah by a metre-gauge line along the spit and thence to San'a. Construction was begun at Ras el-Kethib, and about 5 miles of track were laid, but without providing adequate means for landing or handling material. The war between Italy and Turkey and, since then, the European war, have put an end to the scheme for the present, with the net result that what material was not destroyed by the Italian bombardment now lies rusting. Hodeidah has two forts, the north and south, both falling into ruin but conspicuous from seaward. The houses are tall and are usually of stone or brick, almost every one having its characteristic wattle shelter on the flat roof where the inhabitants seek the cool air at night. The town is divided into two quarters by a semi circular wall which reaches the shore at both ends : the old town, in the space towards the sea, consists of tall stone houses, narrow streets, and covered bazaars : outside the wall lies a large area of thatched houses, sheds, and compounds which recall the native172 YEMEN villages of Uganda. The town in general is dirty, insanitary, and unhealthy. There is an open market for the exchange of the natural products of the country—coffee, hides, skins—in an expanse of sand outside the.town ; the bazaars, within the walls, for sup plies of a general kind, are considerable and well stocked. In the immediate neighbourhood of the town are extensive areas of palm-grove and garden, but, immediately beyond, the surrounding country is extremely sterile. The water-supply locally is exceedingly poor; there are some brackish wells in the neighbourhood, but pure water has to be brought from a distance of some miles. In normal times there is a fair-sized permanent garrison, and as the town is the point of disembarkation of troops and the depot for stations in the interior, it is always full of soldiers, even in time of peace. In 1897 the population was estimated at over 50,000, but no census has ever been taken. Bury (1913) estimates it at 42,000, including a British Indian community of about 1,000 and 100 Euro peans, mostly Greeks who have shops. Somalis, Abyssinians, and Arabs from the Hadhramaut are very numerous ; but Arabs from the inland highlands are surprisingly few. As to climate, from April to September north-easterly winds prevail, and, for the rest of the year, south-westerly. The heat, though great, is in consequence not insupportable even in summer, and the climate of Hodeidah compares favourably with that of Musawwa' on the opposite coast. But the humidity is great, and many people suffer from ague and rheumatism. Harris says, ' after a rainfall, or in the winter, when the westerly winds are blowing, fever attacks the plain like an epidemic.' The lines of telegraphic communication are : Hodeidah, San'a, Dhamar, Yerim, Ibb, Ta'izz, and Mocha ; (b) Hodeidah, Beit el-Faqih, Zebid, and Mocha ; (c) Hodeidah, Loheia, and Midi, with a branch to Kamaran Island ; and (d) overland and cable connexion with Perim. The trade of Hodeidah has been fully dealt with (see pp. 158 and 159), but it may be added that the Khedivial Mail Steamship Co. steamers call regularly every fortnight and the Florio Rubattino about fortnightly. 2. Mocha, once the chief centre of the Yemen coffee trade, lies in a small bay between two low points about a mile and a quarter apart, on each of which are the ruins of a fort. Between the forts the town-wall extends in a semicircle, in the centre of which the principal gate, called the Bab esh-Shadli, gives access to the town from the main Ta'izz and Hodeidah roads. Opposite this gate, on the sea-front, is a stone jetty which is, however, in a state of decay. The town covers about half a square mileDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 173 of ground, and, in its prosperity, must havo had an imposing appearance from seaward. The houses are stone built and were originally large and whitened, but are now mostly in ruins. The only buildings of any importance still standing intact are the mosques, of which some have lofty minarets, the highest, in the eastern part of the town, rising 118 ft. and forming a conspicuous landmark. The streets are very narrow, and in places have become impassable from the debris. The country round Mocha is a sterile plain, without fresh water *, good water is brought from Musa (24 miles N.) by a conduit, and brackish water may also be obtained from wells at Beilili and Suweis, 5 miles to the east. Mocha no longer holds any position as a trading port. In 1824 it contained about 20,000 inhabitants ; in 1882 the population within the walls had dwindled to 1,500 ; and in 1901 the number was probably not more than 400. A floating population, composed of Arabs, Somalis, and Jews, lives in huts outside the walls. The total present population, within and without, probably fluctuates between 5,000 and 8,000. The decline of Mocha, once the principal seat of commerce in the Red Sea, seems to have been coincident with the establishment of Aden as a British port, and to have been affected also by the rise and development of Hodeidah. Normally, a small garrison is stationed at Mocha to serve three batteries. There is telegraphic communication with (a) San a, via Ta'izz ; (6) Hodeidah, via Zebid ; (c) Perim, overland to Sheikh Sa'id, thence by cable. On the site of the old south port stands a framework iron tower, 167 ft. high, with a flashing light, visible 19 miles. 3. Loheia (Lahiyah), a fair-sized Red Sea port, is situated on the northern side of a small shallow bay, with poor anchorage for small craft only, and difficult of approach in consequence of reefs. It has dhow traffic with Jiddah, Hodeidah, and Aden, exporting small quantities of coffee and importing grain. Water is scarce and brackish. The population is about 5,000, and seems to have risen in recent years, for in 1881 the number of inhabitants was estimated at 2,000 only. There are several defensive at the back of the town, on one of which (150 ft. high) is a fort of some strength where modern guns are mounted ; at the end of 1913 these guns were of light calibre—Hotchkiss, Nordenfelt, and machine—intended for inland defence, but heavier ordnance seems to have been installed since. Loheia is used as a base of operations in Asir; normally the garrison is a battalion. There is telegraphic communication, south with Hodeidah, and north with Midi,174 YEMEN 4. Zebid, the ancient capital of the lowlands, now the residence of a Kaimmakam and a centre of Turkish administration, has always been, and still is, one of the most considerable towns of Yemen. The population was given by Manzoni, in 1880, as 15,000; Bury (1913), however, computed it at 8,000, and this latter figure probably gives the more correct estimate at the present moment. The town, quadrilateral in form, is surrounded by strong walls, restored in recent times and in good condition. There are four gates : on the north, the Bab esh-Sham leading to Beit el-Faqih; on the east, the Bab esh-Shabariq, to Hais and Ta izz ; on the south-west, the Bab en-Nahl; and on the south, the Bab el- Qurtab. Zebid is still famous for its university and Sunnite college which is housed in the Great Mosque, and there are three other large mosques, besides a number of smaller ones. The bazaar is characterized by Manzoni as ' the finest in Yemen', and is well stocked with local produce of vegetables and fruit, besides imported supplies. Outside the walls are the Beshi fort and barracks for a considerable Turkish garrison. The town is on the Hodeidah- Beit el-Faqih-Mocha telegraph line. In the extensive tract of Wadi Zebid cotton and indigo are cultivated as special products, but not to the same extent as formerly; and the weaving and dyeing industries, for which at one time Zebid was famous, have been largely transferred to Hodeidah (see p. 157). The turbulent Zaranik, who occupy the district to north, with the head-quarters of their chief at 9 miles distant, much disturb the town's communications. 5. Beit el-Faqih, an ancient seat of learning, lies some 30 miles east by south of Hodeidah. The population is about 5,000, but was greater formerly when the town was the centre of the coffee trade. It is garrisoned normally by a battalion, stationed there to overawe the Zaranik tribesmen, whose incursions have ruined the town's trade. Like Zebid, it was formerly also a centre of the cotton and indigo production and of the weaving and dyeing industries. (There is another town of the same name, distinguished as el-Keblr ; it is about equidistant from Hodeidah on the north, on the Loheia road.) 6. Hals, about 20 miles south-east of Zebid, lies at the junction of two main roads, to Ta'izz and to Ibb, on the telegraph line from Hodeidah to Mocha ; it is a small garrisoned town, much decayed. 7. Sheikh Sa'id, important only as a telegraph station, is situated on the extreme south-westerly point of Arabia, on the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb, opposite the island of Perim, with whichDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 175 it is connected by a short cable. The station, consisting of a few houses, stands on the west side of a small promontory and about Wmi three miles from a fort, built at the point where the Anglo-Turkish iBjl frontier (see p. 179) between the Aden Protectorate and Yemen ^ meets the sea. The port consists of an inlet running about 2 miles inland, 50 yards broad at the mouth and widening to nearly a mile ; there is a good landing-place just south of Cape Sheikh Sa'id. 8. The Kamaran Quarantine Station, for pilgrims on their way flfs: to and from Mecca, lies on the eastern side of Kamaran Island, 5 ^ which belongs to Turkey. The pilgrims are segregated in enclosed 5 ® camps and kept there for a number of days that varies with 1S® circumstances. There is a well-equipped hospital and a number Mt of houses for the accommodation of the medical staff. The adminis- W® tration is in the hands of the international quarantine board, and wdii the doctors and other officials are very cosmopolitan. The station simp has a short tramway, an ice-making plant, and a distillery, and is iffltbl connected by telegraph with the mainland by a branch of the Hod Hodeidah-Loheia line. On the other side of Kamaran there is a small native village in a palm-grove; elsewhere the island is prac- infe tically devoid of vegetation, eitati 2. Jauf Nejrdn Stretching away some 160 miles NNE. of Yemen, and separated fdlit from the plateau of San'a by the arid downs of Nehm and Beled Khaulan, is an extensive hollow 1 —or, more precisely, a broken chain meS® of hollows. This great irregular depression runs north and south, t jji falling away from the tableland of Yemen and Asir, and having )f ties on the east the high sands of the great eastern desert. The southern tio# part of the depression is Jauf (known more particularly as Jauf haven el-Yemen), the old centre of Sabaean civilization ; the northern -.gnWil: part, divided from the first by a sandy swell, a protruding arm of jndfe the western fringe of Ahqaf, is Nejran, famous as the last refuge of Christianity in Arabia. The depression may be approached from San'a by way of the Kharid valley from the south, or by a road via Khamir and Sa'dah from the north, j^jin Jauf comprises Upper and Lower Jauf (or, according to some e [ e2l j|| authorities. Upper, Middle, and Lower), and may be considered to p-j i include the contiguous oases of Khdb and The tract gets its water-supply, in the main, from the Kharid, a remarkable stream s ( a (ii said to be perennial in parts, which takes its rise in the San'a plateau ,■ jji and has a north-north-easterly course till reaching the oasis, when it suddenly bends SE., leaves the oasis, and is then either lost in176 YEMEN the sands or perhaps filters its way through to the Wadi Hadhra- maut. Speaking of this river, Halevy in 1870 describes it as a ' considerable water-courseand though he saw it' in full summer and during a particularly dry season he reports it as being 'full of good-sized fish'. Jauf contains, according to Halevy's experience, more ancient ruins than any other district of Arabia. Among these the most important from a historical point of view are those which bear to-day the names of Ma'in and Mareb. The former undoubtedly represents the capital of the Minaeans. Upper Jauf, with the neighbouring oases of Khab and Marashi, is peopled mainly by the powerful tribe of Dim Husein, whose very numerous villages, of which the chief is (where an important fair is held), are scattered over the various oases. Their lands are described as ' cultivated with extreme care in spite of the complete lack of running water ', especially in the Khab Oasis. Middle and Lower Jauf are peopled by the Beled Hamdan, whose chief settled towns are Ghail and Hazm, each of which is said to be ' situated in an oasis of palms and running waters situated about 30 miles due S. of Lower Jauf and 55 miles ENE. of San'a, was described by Niebuhr (1762) as ' still, actually, the principal town of Jauf, and consisting of 300 poor housesIt was the Sabaean capital, and, according to Halevy, is in ruins with the exception of that part, situated on a hill, which forms the modern town and is surrounded by a solid stone wall. The ruins extend around a hill, along Wadi Shibwan, and cover an area of about 500 metres in diameter ; among them stand out a number of marble columns without capitals. The site of the famous dam is from 2 to 3 hours' journey to the west, at the entrance of a valley which forms the bed of Wadi Shibwan. The part still existing shows the remains of a dyke, of very solid construction, with several sluices. A little to the south-west are to be seen the ruins of a large building of hewn stone, admirably constructed, against a gigantic rock. The ceme tery of ancient Mareb lies on both sides of the road leading from the modern town to 'the dam. The intervening country between Jauf and Mareb is an arid region of deep, moving sand-dunes; and the approach from San'a is by way of Wadis Sirr, Sharafah, and Shibwan. The Khauldn country, which lies south of these wadis, is described by Halevy as ' one of the best-cultivated tracts of Arabia, having numerous villages at short intervals, abundant cereals and fruits, but inhabited by a savagely fanatical , people'. 1 The feudal system appears to obtain in Jauf, the three principal classes being the sherlfs, the nobles or lords, and the orDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 177 villagers. The sherifs are numerous ; they are good horsemen, and they deliberately foment trouble between the tribes, since they secure a share of the spoils in quarrels. The nobles are privileged freemen, owning the land and the houses ; they trade, and conduct caravans, but seldom do manual work. The are not admitted to the deliberations of the commune, nor are they allowed to own property, whatever they possess being regarded as belonging to their lords, who can take it at any time. They must work a certain number of days in their owners' fields, and give tithes of their own crops. They are bound to follow their lords in war, but are forbidden to carry arms in ordinary times, and they must not be mounted, nor wear turbans. In return for service, their lord pro tects them against all aggression Jews are numerous in all the districts of Jauf, and, like the are owned by the nobles. In Lower Jauf in particular they are kept in hard servitude ; but in the oasis of Khab and the north are less harshly treated. The Jew's house, even though built by himself, belongs to his lord, and Jewish women frequently abuse the Arabs with impunity from the roofs, since the house, as the lord's property, is immune from attack. In most districts the Jews are the only artisans, and are held in respectful toleration for this reason. Mur ders are common, but can be settled on a money basis. For a noble, the murderer pays not less than 2,000 cows; if a is killed, his lord gets 500 cows ; if a Jew, 501 cows, the odd cow going to the Jew's family. In religion the dominant doctrine is Sunni and Hanifi, but a good number of tribes belong to the Shafei school. Nejran is separated from Upper Jauf by a four days' journey across difficult hilly country, peopled by the Barath, Aktaf, and Adhlah tribes ; or it may be approached by a three days' march es, i NE. from Sa'dah. The Wadi Nejran runs east and west, and is lildinjl enthusiastically described by Halevy as ' a delicious, fertile, and :t, ft prosperous valley extending between two mountainsand by d rt Niebuhr as ' an agreeable country with abundant water, rich in juntrjl cereals and fruits, especially dates, having excellent pasture, and yi ^ horses and camels that are much sought after'. Wadi Habiinah, Sirr fc an equally productive valley according to Halevy, runs parallel with jojpi Wadi Nejran to the north, the two being separated by a short (jesttf day's march across a ridge. The water of Nejran comes from the ^oit i'' uplands of Asir and trends eastward, being then probably soon vajel^ i* 1 tih.© Ahqaf ; that of Habunah goes north-eastward and perhaps joins Wadi Dawasir (but, according to Leachman, loses ^ itself independently in the Ahqaf). j ri|t;' Nejran is noteworthy, not only for its ancient civilization, but arabia 1178 YEMEN for the well-being of its present inhabitants, as well as for its peculiar heterodoxy. The chief modem settlement appears to be (or Mikhlaf),' situated in the midst of a forest of date-treesat a point where the wadi is about 300 metres wide. The principal ancient site is Najara, the probable ruins of Negrana (known by the Arabs as El-Khudud or El-Ukhud), lying somewhat to the ESE., in a fertile plain not far from a modem mosque. The other settlements, dotted in close proximity about the oasis, are very numerous. As in Jauf there are many Jewish colonies, and, according to Halevy, nowhere in Arabia are the Jews held in higher esteem, or do they enjoy more liberty.CHAPTER VII ADEN AND HADHRAMAUT The Resident of Aden exercises political influence over a very extensive tract of country in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, south of a line beginning at Ras Turbah (Turbakh), a point at the extreme south-westerly corner of Arabia, and extending roughly in a north-easterly direction to the desert; it comprises all the terri tory to the south of this line, inclusive of the Hadhramaut. In the present chapter this region will be considered in two sections : (A) Aden and the Interior (including the Aden Protectorate proper), and (B) The Hadhramaut. A. ADEN AND THE INTERIOR Area The Aden Interior includes the actual Protectorate (q. v. p. 183) and the remoter tribes under the outer Aden sphere of influence, but excludes the Sultanates of the Hadhramaut and the Wahidi. Its western boundary is the delimitation line drawn (Jan. 1902- Dec. 1904) by the Anglo-Turkish Commission, from Ras Turbah, a point opposite Perim Island, inland past Jalilah, north of Dhala and a little south of Qa'tabah, to the Bana River, and produced thence by a line, not fixed by actual survey, north-east to Beihan el-Jezab. The eastern boundary is not so clearly defined, but may be indicated by a line drawn northward from Sheikh'Abd er-Rahman (a coastal shrine marking the lower 'Aulaqi eastern border) to a point half-way between Yeshbum, an important settlement in upper 'Aulaqi, and Habban, a town of the Wahidi Sultanate. The northern limit is the Ruba' el-Khali, or great inland desert, the Sherif of Beihan el-Jezab being the most northerly chief in political relationship with Aden. The southern limit is, of course, the sea- coast. Within this frontier the most important section is the western, comprising the territories of the Emir of Dhala, the Haushabi, and a portion of the Subeihi. Through these districts pass the main trade-routes from Turkish Yemen, the only routes m 2180 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR which could be utilized by a force advancing into British territory from Yemen, or the converse. The main lines of communication are three : (a) through the Dhala valley, (6) through the Tiban valley, and (c) past Mafalis and down Wadi Ma'din, a tributary of the Wadi Darr. The area of the Aden Interior, thus considered, ie about 19,000 sq. miles. Physical Chabacter The region may be divided into six clearly defined zones, roughly parallel with the coast and not greatly differing from those of Yemen: (1) The littoral belt. (2) The maritime ranges. (3) The intramontane plains. (4) The main watershed. (5) The up-country plateau. (6) The great inland desert. (1) The littoral belt is a level, maritime plain, chiefly desert and often saline near the coast. Two important oases may be noted : (a)that of Lahej, in the 'Abdali Sultanate, between Wadis Kebir and Saghir, bifurcations of the Tiban valley; (6) Abiyan, a large district of scattered villages and cultivation lying between Wadis Bana and Hasan. Each of these oases has an approximate area of 60 sq. miles, but that of Lahej is by far the richer of the two. (2) The littoral belt, which varies in width from 40 miles to less than four, is backed by low ranges of maritime hills, black and metamorphic, which culminate here and there in upstanding and often twin peaks of 3,000 or more feet in altitude. Passes, by which caravan routes cross the crest, average 2,500 ft. The maritime scarps of the ranges are barren and almost waterless ; but the inland slopes, which are far less abrupt, hold wooded water -courses and permanent wells. (3) The series of broad plains, inland of the maritime hills, which average 2,000 ft. above sea-level, are of sterile aspect but have a small regular rainfall in the summer, which enables fairly large areas to be placed under cultivation. (4) The main watershed rises almost sheer from the plains and in parts, especially at the eastern end, has the appearance of an un broken wall, but really consists of several mountain ranges whicn overlap each other. The crests attain an average altitude ot 7,000 ft. above sea-level. Passes, on caravan routes, seldom exceed 5,000 ft. in height. This main watershed is highest in the west where it merges into the Yemen highlands. It is usually knownPHYSICAL CHARACTER 181 among the natives as the Kaur, or highland, with various local names attached, such as Kaur el-'Audillah, El-Od (or El-'Aud), Edth, &amp;c. It is well watered, but the maritime scarps are comparatively- sterile and much steeper than the internal slopes. Unlike the Yemen highlands, the Kaur is thinly populated by semi-nomadic, pastoral tribes, and is poorly cultivated. (5) Inland of this ridge the ground gradually descends in a series of terraces to large well-watered plateaux lying at an average altitude of 5,000 ft., where are most of the mountain settlements and extensive cultivated tracts. The plateaux are intersected by many subsidiary ranges of foot-hills running down from the ridge, and they decline gradually towards the north and north east, the fertile and broken terrain opening out by degrees into broad and comparatively sterile tracts, which merge into the rolling sands of the Ruba' el-Khali. (6) The great inland desert has a mean altitude of 3,500 ft. along its southern margin, while occasional isolated ranges, far out in the desert, probably rise to 5,000 ft. ; this is as much as human know ledge can say at present about the Ruba' el-Khali. The innumerable wadis, deep and precipitous in their upper reaches in the plateaux but shallower and broader as they cross the plain, by which this region as a whole is intersected, run mostly in a southerly direction. As in other parts of South-West Arabia, all are dry during the greater part of the year, but water courses come down in violent spate when heavy rain has fallen in the hills, and then some of the larger ones reach the sea. Of these wadis the most important (enumerating from west to east) are Tarbaha, Timnan, Am Shahar, Darr, the Tiban which bifurcates north of Lahej and waters that oasis with its two branches Wadi Kebir and Wadi Saghir, the Bana, some 40 miles east of Aden, which in time of flood cuts its way through the sand-bar at its mouth to the sea, Wadi Hasan, fed by Wadi Yeramis, and Wadi Ahwar (Huwar), fed by Wadis Jahr (Gahr) and Leikah. North of the Kaur the country is drained by Wadis Beihan, Khalla, Surum, Khaura, Na'man (or Na'mah), Khatib, and 'Abdan, all of which have more or less direct northerly courses, and sooner or later merge into the unexplored Wadi Markhah which loses itself in the Safi (or (Ahqaf). The Tiban calls for special mention as, with its complex ramifications, it forms the main artery of communication with the Yemen. Of its innumerable branches, the 'Aqqan, Warazan, Sudan, andTisan (or Qaisan) on the r. bank, and Bilih and Tabaghain on the 1., are the chief. The stream of the Tiban is perennial, though short waterless stretches of river-bed will be met with, during182 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR the greater part of the year, in certain places. These interruptions are due to the entire volume of water—which in dry seasons is not very considerable—being led off into the cultivation and returned again lower down. It is said that the waters of the Tiban, like those of the Bana, occasionally reach the sea after abnormal floods. The Bana River runs continuously from May to October. The coast-line generally is low and sandy and devoid of promon tories or inlets of any size, except at Aden, where craterous pro montories rise to about 1,700 ft. above sea-level, forming sheltered bays, and at a point some sixty miles west of Aden, where a spur of the Yemen highlands approaches the coast at Khor TJmeirah. Climate In the first zone—the littoral—the heat in general is excessive, but the climate is not unhealthy for those who can stand the fierce heat of the day, and the nights are cool. The cultivated oases and river-beds, however, which afiord grateful shade by day, should be avoided as fever traps, and the Tiban valley and Lahej oasis in general have an ill name for malaria of a malignant type. The only rainfall is afforded by a few showers in mid-winter. Cultiva tion depends chiefly on irrigation from the wadi water-courses, and consists almost entirely of millet, jowari, and tall fodder crops such as kirbi. In the second zone—the maritime hills—the rainfall is as in the first zone ; but there is no opportunity for wadi irrigation, and in consequence scarcely any crops are raised. The air is stifling by day and damp at night. In the third zone—the intramontane plains—the rainfall takes place during the summer in occasional thunderstorms. The crops are millet and maize, and they become more abundant and fertile as the main watershed is approached. The heat here, again, is very great. In the fourth zone—the main watershed—there is a considerable rainfall during the summer months, and a bracing and fairly equable climate with sometimes a degree or so of frost at night. Cultiva tion is scanty, chiefly barley and a few light fodder crops. In the fifth zone—the plateau—water lies within ten feet or so of the surface, and there is a good deal of irrigation from wells, besides the regular rainfall. This is small, but from October to March the region is liable to dense white fogs which fall after dark and lie thick to 9 a.m. They will wet one through in an hour, but are invaluable to the farmer as they alone keep the crops alive tillCLIMATE 183 the summer thunderstorms are due. These latter are often ex tremely violent, even terrifying. Hail occasionally falls. Harvest ing of one crop or another goes on throughout the year—chiefly bearded wheat, barley, maize, lucerne,and coffee (but the latter is less frequent than over the Yemen border). Indigo and cotton (a very small bush) are grown in the Nisab district and grapes on the Yemen border. In the sixth zone—the Empty Quarter or Great Red Desert— the population is pastoral and follows the grazing according to the rainfall, which is irregular and scanty. Along the principal wadis, which lead north towards the desert, there are permanent settlements and cereal crops are raised, chiefly millet, the stalks of which make useful fodder when grazing is scarce. The semi- nomadic part of the population returns to the settlements to await the next grazing-season in the desert. In the Aden Interior as a whole the prevailing diseases are small pox, fever (especially malarial), and, to some extent, consumption. The ' Yemen ulcer ' is also common among the tribes. Population The population of the Aden Interior (considered as a whole, and including that portion known strictly as the Aden Protectorate), settled and nomadic, may be computed at about half a million. The district is composed of a number of Tribal Confederations or Sultanates, some lying within the limits of the Protectorate proper, some without. The limits of the Aden Protectorate proper are the delimitation line, previously mentioned, from Has Turbah to a point some few miles north of Dhala, and thence a somewhat vaguely defined line continuing at first in a south-easterly direction and then in a generally easterly direction to the coast of the Gulf of Aden near the small settlement of Maqatin. They enclose an area of about 4,200 sq. miles, having a population of 100,000. The tribal con federations lying within this boundary are: the Subeihi, 'Abdali, Fadhli, Haushabi, Amiri, 'Alawi, 'Aqrabi, and other smaller tribes ; and without are the Yafa', 'Aulaqi, Beida, Oleh, and 'Audillah ('Audali). The tribes of the Protectorate have a larger proportion of non-combatants and are more settled than those of the remoter interior ; the bulk are to be found in the towns and villages of the littoral belt, the chief centres being Lahej, Waht, Shughrah, and the Abiyan district. In dealing with a variety of tribes with such different character istics it is difficult to generalize ; broadly they may be divided184 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR into settled or agricultural, and nomad races, with the differences due to and inseparable from their modes of life. The racial type which marks the original population of this part of Arabia is characterized by a coppery complexion and high cheek-bones, not unlike the purer strains of old North American Indian blood. The hair is straight and usually tied up tightly in a bunch on the top of the head, a mode of immemorial antiquity, depicted on Egyptian monuments. But this indigenous type, though still exclusively confined to some of the littoral sub-tribes and to others in the maritime ranges, has been greatly modified by incursions of the taller Semitic race, who wear their hair loose and wavy and lack the reddish complexion of the indigenous race ; they came from the north, mainly the ancient district of Jauf, which appears to have been convulsed by bitter internal strife after the Prophet's death, owing to the jealousy of rival factions which followed the decease of the then paramount chief, Ma'an. His family fled southward to escape persecution, followed by other branches of a former ruling house. They finally pene trated as far south as the Yeshbum valley, where they settled as mere ray a, or tributary subjects of the Ahl Bunyar people, under the 'Abd el-Wahid Sultanate which then dominated the country nearly to the city of Nisab. Increasing in power and numbers these Jaufi clans eventually drove the Bunyar on to the Dahr plateau, where they remain to this day, and thrust back the 'Abd el-Wahid rule as far as the strong city of Habban. The clans now proclaimed themselves an integral tribal unit which became the nucleus and origin of the Upper Aulaqi. They formed an alliance with their southern neighbours, the Ba Kazim, who, thus assisted, threw off the 'Abd el-Wahid yoke too, and became the Lower 'Aulaqi. Upper and Lower Yafa' have been colonized in much the same way—the invaders in this case coming from Yemen. The central district of Dathinah presents both types, as does the Fadhli country, while the 'Abdali have absorbed so much alien blood as to have almost lost all racial distinction ; they are indeed strongly charac terized by negroid intermarriages which have introduced a swarthy coarse-featured type. Still further west, the Subeihi still preserve an indigenous type, though tainted with negro blood. The fighting organization and equipment of the confederations deserve somewhat detailed notice. Beginning with the Sultan and the ' Dolah ', or adult males of his house, we find that all wear the national dagger or jambiyah ; but the scabbard does not curl up in horse-shoe form, unless its owner is something of a swashbuckler,POPULATION 185 and wears the tribal pattern. The Sultan himself, and the senior members of his house, when on duty or attending public functions, wear swords of scimitar design for cutting only, with a very small hilt and inadequate guard. The scabbard, of red morocco leather mounted in silver, is slung by a loop of silken cord over the left shoulder. The ' Naqibs' (governors), when representing the Sultan, also carry swords, but they are none of them, as a rule, good swords men. Some of the more civilized potentates on the littoral carry pistols or revolvers as well. Working down through the Sultan's household we come to the askaris, or hereditary retainers (this term is also applied to tribesmen when serving as a permanent detachment). The here ditary class does not as a rule provide good combatants, for all their males are enrolled in the ranks automatically—regardless of physique or fitness—on attaining puberty, and serve till too decrepit to get about. Being looked on as servants rather than soldiers, they are not adapted to the rigours of campaigning, nor do they practise much with firearms, which are the property of the Sultan. They are, in fact, chiefly engaged on police duty and the enforce ment of bazaar taxes. With them may be classed the abid or slaves—the most consistently faithful dependants of any Sultanate. They are armed like the askaris, but occasionally carry a scabbardless nimshah —a straight, single-edged blade, round- pointed and heavy-backed, with a plain unguarded hilt like the handle of an ordinary knife. Slaves do not wear the jambiyah. The askari's jambiyah is his own property. Both and slaves are partly armed with matchlocks or rifles, according to the resources of the Sultan's arsenal; and the less efficient and junior members of the corps carry spears. The jambiyah has been fully described elsewhere (p. 153 f.). Spear-heads are long and narrow, of privet-leaf shape, fashioned of soft steel, with sharp edges and point, but no barb, the hafts varying from five to six feet in length. Lances, used by cavalry, have shorter heads than spears, and stouter hafts, about seven feet in length, gripped overhand. Matchlock guns are rapidly becoming obsolete and are being replaced by the breech-loader, the most com mon pattern being the Graz rifle or carbine. Remingtons, Turkish Martinis, and a few other patterns are occasionally seen. Practically all the Subeihi have breech-loaders, and the Quteibi and Haushabi are well provided with them. As time goes on the Arab will, generally, thanks to his better armament, become a more formidable foe. Ammunition for the breech-loader is not very plentiful, and native reloading and recapping have not, as yet, proved very successful.186 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR The tribesman forms the real fighting strength of the Sultanate and provides his own weapons, drawing ammunition—or its equivalent in cash—from the Sultan, when on state service. His hardihood, activity, and keen sight make him a formidable opponent. He has a natural aptitude for scouting and possesses remarkable powers of endurance, being independent of much transport, whilst the constant friction along the tribal borders engenders a high state of combatant training. The Sultan frequently uses one tribe to fight another as a punishment for raiding, but he cannot claim tribal service against tribal interests ; any real emergency, however, will bring the tribesmen in. Individuals and small detachments will serve an alien for pay beyond the limits of their tribeship. The tribesmen are really civilians (a term used for want of a better, though this word does not exactly translate the Arabic word mwi, plural ray a), but prepared at a moment's notice to leave flocks and camels, farms or pasture, or trekking, when danger threatens clan, tribe, or Sultanate. They give no regular military service under any condition, nor do they practise the use of weapons, but content themselves with the reluctant payment of a tax and the unavoidable imposts of the Grovernment that guards their lives and property. They may be divided into the following classes: merchants, of more or less influence and wealth ; mechanics and artisans; the ' hejris ' or freed serfs, usually attached to some chief as agricultural labourers or to some master craftsman; and lastly, and lowest in the social scale, the slaves, the males serving as retainers or subordinate husbandmen and the females as domestic servants or attendants on children. The latter class, however, are slaves only in name, having usually their own menage, and they remain in one family from generation to generation; they are mostly Swahilis and Nubians. One other class needs passing mention—the shdhids or bards, whose duty, in the exercise of their profession, is to stimulate the tribal standard of chivalry by heroic strains of former prowess, or with stinging satire to lash a slothful ruler to martial vigour. When belligerent tribes are set in battle, it is the shd on either side who urge the courage of the combatants. In religion two schools of the Sunni creed—the Hanifi (or philosophic school) and the Shafei—are followed, the latter, the nearest to the early Islamic tradition, being the more general. The practice of religion varies, of course, in different districts, and among some of the nomad races it is little more than a name. Speaking of religious observance among the people of this region as a whole, Bury says : ' The laity, while fanatical to the verge ofPOPULATION 187 i frenzy on religious matters, and ever ready to accuse any one, whose actions are not readily explained, of being an infidel, are apt to be rather slack in their devotions. Some even shirk their prayers at sunset, when such exercises are obligatory. Much of this attitude, however, has to do with their turbulent mode of life and illiteracy, for the most nonchalant are always ready to ' fall in ' behind any man who has the gift of prayer and follow his attitude and genuflexions, giving the responses with devout accuracy and attention. As to the religious self-denial with which they observe the fast of Ramadan (refusing to avail themselves of the exemption extended by the Koran to all travellers, sick persons, &amp;c.) their austerity would shame more civilized Mussulmans.' Products and Industries The products of this region are so similar to those of the Yemen that they need no special treatment; and the crops are referred to in detail in the section on climate. The staple food-stuff of the country is either dhura or dukhn Of there are two chief varieties : white and red. The staple fodder for animals is, uni versally, the stalks and leaves of and As to the native industries they are not of any great importance, but atten tion may be called to the following : Boat-building is carried on to a limited extent. Though a very great number of native craft of very varied type ply in Aden harbour and around the coast of this district, only ' jolly-boats ' are built at Aden ; they are after the model of an English rowing-boat, with heavier and stronger frames, and of very rough workmanship. Mat-making and string-making are carried on chiefly in the neighbourhood of Aden. Dry leaves of the and date-palms are imported from the ports of the Dankali and from Musawwa', and are manufactured into mats. String is also made by twisting the leaves together with the hand; this is called ' Aden string'. To make mats the leaves are divided into small strips, which are plaited into a ribbon three or four inches wide and of great length. The ribbon is stitched or spliced spirally into a cylindrical shape, the circumference representing the required breadth, and the axis the necessary length; this hollow cylinder is then cut down with a knife parallel to the axis, and the broken edges are bound. Somali women are exceedingly ex pert in the manufacture of such mats, which are in great request for sleeping purposes. The coarser kinds are largely used for the con struction of sheds and the roofing of houses. Plates, baskets, sacks, and many other articles are made of such strips of matting.188 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR Spinning, weaving, and dyeing are also common industries, Cotton is spun into thread by hand-spindles and then woven iii hand-looms, and sometimes machine-made yarns or twists are used ®tli in the same way ; the looms are of the very simplest construction. 11! The industry is still carried on to a small extent at Aden, and HI somewhat more extensively at a few centres in the interior, notably H at Nisab and Markhah, which are situated in the cotton and indigo (ill growing district of the 'Aulaqi country ; here a large amount of i® cotton fabrics for tribal shawls and turbans is made. The stuffs, §1 when required, are dyed with locally prepared indigo. Samna'ah, 1 a town in the Beida country, is famous for a special make of goat- (i hair carpets. H Charcoal burning is an industry carried on at several places in the a l interior, among the wooded slopes of the hilly districts. Potash is ifc also manufactured from a product known as ' Aden balsam'; fj this is not found in any quantity in Aden itself, but is prepared fa in the 'Abdali and Fadhli districts. The balsam is thrown into iH small pits about two feet wide and one deep, and wood is added; § the mass is then set fire to, and as the sap exudes from the plant § it mingles with the ashes ; the mixture is stirred and allowed to |o cool; then it is dug up and sent into Aden on camels, for sale. (| The price is about 8 annas per maund of 28 lb., and the potash is I|jj exported to Bombay for washing purposes. A primitive form of Jij distilling is also in vogue, the natives producing a liquor from dates H which have been placed in water and allowed to disintegrate, p The industry is carried on at Aden (under certain restrictions) and aj other places. ft Trade ^ Practically the whole of the trade of this region is centred in Aden—local trade as well as general. The trade of the only other notable port of this littoral, Shughrah (and even that of Makalla in I; Hadhramaut), is restricted and purely local in character, and is It entirely subservient to that of Aden. ie The total value of the trade of Aden (import and export), in siii round numbers, for the last two years has been : 1913-1 4 £8,530,000 1914-1 5 £6,940,000. This falls into two categories : Transhipment trade, and Inland (or local) trade. Comparative figures for the year 1914-15, were: Transhipment .... £6,682,000 Inland . . * . . £258,000.TRADE 189 From, these figures it may be noted how greatly the transhipment trade exceeds the local in amount and importance. The following are the details of the two categories taken separately. (1) Transhipment trade. The principal articles of import, in a * ! X914-15, taken in their order of value were: Cotton goods of various Idnds, £580,000 ; hides and skins, £520,000 ; grains and pulse (including flour), £490,000; coffee, £320,000; coal, £210,000; rK 5* tobacco, £150,000 ; sugar and confectionery, £90,000 ; provisions, ■■ ^ £70,000 ; oils, gums and resins, silk goods, and ivory. The principal articles of export were : Hides and skins, £640,000 ; cotton goods, £530,000; coffee, £380,000; grains and pulse, £360,000 ; tobacco, £110,000 ; salt, £76,000; sugar, £75,000; gums ralplttii: and resins, £35,000 ; provisions, £30,000 ; dyeing and tanning ids. fi materials, shells, and ivory. The movement and distribution of the trade of Aden with dif- bffl is{!| ferent countries and localities was as follows in 1914-15: total trade is tk w ith India, £1,180,000; Jibuti and Obok (French Somaliland), woodiil £780,000 ; the United Kingdom, £700,000 ; the United States, froitkf £600,000; Arabian Red Sea ports (chiefly Hodeidah, Jiddah, and and all Mocha), £400,000 ; Somaliland, £340,000 ; Arabian Sea ports (Muscat, Makalla, Shiheir, &amp;c.), £260,000; France, £190,000; Italian Red Sea ports (Musawwa', Assab), £140,000 ; Abyssinia, £130,000 ; Independent Somali ports, £115,000 ; Egypt, £80,000 ; iqnorfe: Mozambique^ £35,000, &amp;c. (2) Inland trade. Though the foregoing facts are instructive in restricts a general way, it is more essential, for the particular purpose of this book, to consider in detail the trade of Aden with the interior. The movement in 1914-15 was as follows: Imports from the interior .... £140,000 Exports to the interior .... £120,000. '' ■ t; The principal articles that passed out, arranged in the order of Wsfte8their value, were; coffee, £30,000; fodder, £29,000; drugs almost entirely), £21,000; raw hides and skins, £18,000; firewood , c and charcoal, £14,000 ; animals (chiefly bullocks, sheep, and goats, aI1 and, in a less degree, camels), £6,000; provisions (including native food products such as ghi, eggs, and honey), £8,000 ; vegetables l.oDl' and fruits (the latter chiefly dates), £5,000 ; oils (chiefly 1,94# or sesame-oil), £3,000; dyeing and tanning materials (including tr . 1( l e aait saffron and henna), £1,000; and other less important products ' Ull-lS, such as reeds (for building purposes and mats), sesame, madder, , Ml wax, potash, and rose-water. The principal articles which passed into the interior were :190 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR Cotton (piece-goods and yarns), £30,000; grains (jowari, bajri, rice and wheat flour), £30,000 ; tobacco (unmanufactured), £25,000' spices, £16,000; seeds, £6,000; provisions (including dates)' £5,000 ; sugar, £4,000 ; oils (chiefly petroleum and £1,900; metals (wrought iron and copper), £1,000 ; turmeric and indigo^ soap, and matches. Rrom the figures of the total trade of Aden, given at the outset, it will be noted that there was a considerable decline in 1914-15 as compared with 1913-14, mostly due to prohibitions and restrictions consequent on the war. Trade has in fact been temporarily thrown back five years, the total value of trade in 1909-10 having been £6,900,000. Aden was made a free port in 1850, Previous to that year the average total yearly trade of the town was about £120,000; in 1903-4 it had risen to just under £6,000,000; in 1913-14 (the most recent normal year) it had attained more than £8,600,000. On the opening of the port in 1850 much of the valuable trade between Arabia and the eastern coast of Africa, formerly monopohzed by Hodeidah and Mocha, was attracted to it; but this marvellously rapid development has, undoubtedly, been mainly due to the opening of the Suez Canal. During the seventy odd years of British rule, the population of the town has multiplied sevenfold, and Aden now forms, normally, not only the chief centre of the Arabian trade with Africa, but an entrepot and distributing centre for an ever increasing European and Asiatic commerce. In the year ending March 31, 1915, 2,481 vessels, of an aggregate tonnage of about 3,100,000, entered the port, including 1,300 local craft of 38,000 aggregate tonnage—as compared with 3,000 vessels of just under 4,000,000 aggregate tonnage in 1913-14. Of the 1,181 merchant vessels cleared in 1914-15 about 660, with an aggregate tonnage of 1J millions (or about half the total tonnage) were British; the rest were of foreign nationality and native craft. The coffee trade, which now finds its principal outlet at Aden, was formerly almost entirely in the hands of the Hodeidah merchants : but the heavy dues of the Turkish authorities at the latter place, coupled with the insecurity of the routes under Turkish control, have diverted a large part of the coffee to Aden. Much is shipped from Hodeidah to Aden direct by sea; the coffee which reaches Aden direct is brought down by caravans from the highlands of the interior. A very considerable quantity is also brought across from the African coast, being shipped from Zeila, one of the Somali ports; it is carried thither on camels from the highlands of Harrar and the Galla country, which, like the Yemen highlands, are suitableTRADE 191 to the growth of the coffee bush. Pood-stuffs are imported from India and from the African coast, as well as from the interior of Arabia. Sheep and goats are shipped weekly in large numbers from Berbera, Bulbar, and Zeila; while oxen, fodder, vegetables, and fuel come in mostly by caravan from Lahej and the surrounding country. Ostrich feathers reach Aden from the Somali and Danakil country ; mother-of-pearl shells from the Persian Gulf and Red Sea fisheries ; ivory from Somaliland and Abyssinia. CxJKEENCY Aden Town, as a part of the British Indian Administration, has a rupee currency, and since January 1898 the sterling value of the rupee has been nearly steady at Is. or thereabouts, and the British sovereign is legal tender at about 15 rupees. The other coins in use are as follows :— Gold. Napoleon ^ value varying Turkish pound of 100 piastres Turkish dollar of 25 piastres Silver. Maria Theresa dollar Spanish Theresa dollar Netherlands Theresa dollar French 5-franc piece with the rate of exchange. value varying with the rate of exchange. The smaller silver coins of foreign countries have no fixed value, and are taken at about their nominal value in Indian currency. The favourite coin in use in this part of Arabia is the Maria Theresa dollar {riydl), the value of which is affected by the local demand. The value of all gold and silver coins other than the above is fixed by the bullion merchants, in accordance with information received by telegraph from Bombay. In default of advices from Bombay, foreign coins are sold by weight and touch. Exchange. The rate of exchange on Europe is regulated in Aden by advices from Bombay. The above information regarding currency applies in the main to the Aden Settlement and its vicinity. For the remoter parts of the interior little information is available; but it appears that the Maria Theresa dollar is current almost everywhere, and the Indian four-anna piece, locally called a has come to be the standard unit of division. For the Hadhramaut currency see p. 228.CURRENCY 193 The fardsilah. There are three kinds, all used in different places; by it gums, coffee, wax, honey, ivory, shells, and tallow are weighed. There does not appear to have ever been an original standard fara- silah; the recent practice was to fix a stone standard or farasilah for each transaction; gradually, however, the farasilah assumed a fixed weight in different places : 33 rotl in the interior ; 32 J at Berbera ; 35 at Zeila or Harrar. The bahdr. There are three kinds, varying in size according to the article to be weighed : for cotton, 1 bahar = 3| cwt.; for incense and gum, 1 bahar = 3 cwt. ; for tobacco, 1 bahar = 2^ cwt. It is used mainly by the inhabitants of Shiheir and Makalla. The haklsah. Cotton only is sold by this weight to the Arabs of the interior. The hernial or heml (load). Dates and jowari are sold by this weight, which varies with the article weighed, and the manner of import or export (see table above). The candy, an Indian weight, is used at Aden in weighing grain and pulse, cotton from India, and firewood. The thuman or payali is used in selling small quantities of grain. The Jcciluh or liXisvmuh. The former is used for measuring grain, pulse, and salt, and the latter for measuring liquids, such as oil, ghi, and vinegar. The weight of each varies according to the article weighed—in the case of the keilah from 14 lb. 12J oz. to 18 lb. 11^ oz., and in the case of the from 3 lb. to 3 lb. 5 oz. The qdsa and qdda are also used in measuring grain. The dhrd i . The Arabs use this lineal measure for lengths of cotton piece-goods, &amp;c., of different manufacture. It is supposed to be equal to the distance from the tip of the forefinger to the elbow. Government For administrative purposes Aden Settlement forms part of British India and is under the control of the Governor of Bombay in Council, It is administered by a Political Resident, who is also the General Officer Commanding the Aden Brigade, with the assistance of four officers of the Bombay Political Department, one military officer in charge of Perim, one officer of the Public Works Depart ment, as chairman, one officer of the Aden Settlement and Port Trust, and one officer of the Bombay Provincial Police Department, The Resident exercises political infiuence over the whole tract of country extending, on the north and west, to the Anglo-Turkish frontier of \emen and extending to and including the Hadhramaut on the east. The Resident has jurisdiction as a judge of the Vice- aeabia i194 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR Admiralty Court in matters connected with the slave trade; his court is also a Colonial Court of Admiralty. The laws in force in the Settlement are, generally speaking, those of the Bombay Presidency, supplemented on certain points by special regulations drawn up to suit local conditions. In general the local affairs of the Settlement (such as sanitation, conservancy, &amp;c.) are managed by an Executive Committee (formerly Municipal Committee), subject to the control of the Resident: the funds for this purpose are raised by the levy of house tax, octroi, and other imposts. The management of the port is under a Board of Trustees, known as the Aden Port Trust, the principal task of which is to make arrangements for the deepening of the harbour so as to allow vessels of all sizes to enter and leave at all states of the tide. The funds are provided by the levy of tolls and wharfage fees on goods landed or shipped. The police are of two categories ; land police, and harbour police. The former (officers and men) number 377—367 foot and 20 mounted ; the latter number 12, including four inspectors and one or two administrative officials. The normal garrison of Aden consists of the Aden troops, one hundred strong, mounted half on horses and half on camels ; three companies of Garrison Artillery, two of which man the forts, while the third is employed with the movable armament; six companies of British Infantry ; one battalion of Indian Infantry, less detach ments at Perim and Sheikh 'Othman ; one Fortress Company; and the Aden section of Sappers and Miners. On the south-west corner of the peninsula are the forts Tarshein and Morbat, which cover the entrance of the harbour, and are garrisoned by two com panies of Royal Garrison Artillery. The land side is protected by a strongly fortified position across the whole breadth of the isthmus. At the crater are various entrenched positions for infantry to oppose landings, while the ridge, running north and south from Hejuff to Viaduct Gate, forms a second line of defence and includes a redoubt at Ahman Khal, near the southern extremity. The total revenue receipts of Aden treasury in 1914-15, under all heads—imperial, local, and municipal—amounted to 87J lakhs of rupees (approx. £680,000). The chief sources of local revenue are : Aden Port Trust Fund, over 6 lakhs (£34,000); Aden Settle ment Fund, over 4 lakhs (£28,000); Local Supply Bills, 38| lakhs (£257,000); Post Office, over 6 lakhs (£34,000); Excise, abotit 1 lakh (£6,300) ; Income tax, | lakh (£6,000). The total expenditure was about 83| lakhs (approx. £656,000). In the Aden interior the tribes nominate their own chiefs or sultans. The Sultan is never a tribesman himself, but comes fromGOVERNMENT 195 an alien aristocracy imported by the senior confederate states, or is the scion of some ancient ruling race. Intertribal jealousy, feuds, and a fierce spirit of independence have prevented any revival of autocratic government; for patriarchal rule tolerates very little pre rogative, and only such influence as personality, prowess, or wealth can command. Even a ruling sultan may be promptly deposed by the tribe he misgoverns, and he can never rely on direct succession if opposed to the tribal will: though his dynasty may brook all but a general upheaval, an heir is often passed over for a more suitable relative by the nominating chiefs ; and the same rule applies right down the tribal scale to the sheikh of the smallest clan. The largest unit for administrative purposes is the ' confedera tion ' of several subordinate tribes with a larger one, whose Sultan is sufficiently powerful to impose and maintain a sort of suzerainty over the semi-detached tribeships around him, in addition to the tribe under his direct control. The various tribes composing a confederation rank according to their origin and fighting-strength; for the tribal notion is that gain is no good without the grit which alone can preserve it. Each tribe (or leading subdivision) manages its own affairs under the rule of an ' 'Aqil' (wise man) who is always a member of one of the senior clans (into which the tribe is again subdivided), but not necessarily the oldest representative of his house. Here again succession may be set aside, or an 'Aqil deposed in favour of a cadet, by the will of the tribe. The tribe is again divided into ' Afkhadh ' (sing. Fakhdh), or clans ; each of these is under its own sub-'aqil, and its internal affairs may not be interfered with, by the tribal 'Aqil. A clan is composed of a number of families or households under a Sheikh, sometimes large enough to form an entire settlement, which is technically known as a (habitation) or, if strongly fortified, as a ddr (fortress). The Sheikh has no voice in the management of individual family affairs, provided the head of a family does not jeopardize the interests and peace of the clan. The head of a family (usually also called Sheikh, by courtesy) leaves household matters to his women-folk. The tribesmen defer far more to their 'Aqils, or senior chiefs, than to their actual Sultan (if they happen to acknowledge one), who, as has been said before, is rarely, if ever, of tribal blood, and has more often than not been thrust into power during some crisis of tribal politics. His (the Sultan's) influence is directly in relation to his wealth—in proportion, in fact, to the magnificence of his establishment, his hospitality, and the military support his wealth can procure ; but in time of public danger, against an alien foe, all tribesmen would flock to the standard of their nominal N 2196 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR leader, though at ordinary times he may be little more than a figurehead. The British Government has no troops, in normal times, outside a ten-mile radius from the Aden fortress, and does not interfere in tribal or inter-tribal politics. The different confederations are under British influence in varying degrees, but though they have entered into certain treaty obligations they preserve their own autonomy. It may be remarked, broadly, that the obligations are observed—when not inconvenient—in inverse ratio to the protected tribe's distance from Aden. None of the confederations renders tribute to the British Government, either in money or men; none has a standing army in the usually accepted sense, but every adult male is a soldier when occasion requires. Most of the chiefs receive annual stipends from the British Government, and the following are entitled to salutes : the 'Abdali, the Eadhli, theKa'aiti (Hadhramaut), and the Amiri, as well as the Sultans of Qishn and Socotra. It should be added that the individual attitude of some of the confederations towards the British has been temporarily disturbed by recent events. Recent History and Present Politics After being in various hands, Aden was definitely captured by the British from the Sultan of the 'Abdali in January 1839. The Sultan fled to Lahej. From the very first it was evident that the occupation of the town would be of little use unless a good under standing were arrived at with the neighbouring tribes, in whose hands lay the power of interfering with the land-borne trade and the supplies on which, in those early days, the place was so largely dependent. Treaties were therefore concluded successively with the Azzeibi (a branch of the 'Abdali), the 'Aqrabi, Subeihi, Fadhh, Yafa', Amiri, and other tribes ; but, in spite of treaties, the first years of occupation show a turbulent record with a good deal 01 fighting. Four unsuccessful attempts to retake Aden by the 'Abdal, in conjunction with the Fadhli, were made between the years 1839 and 1846 ; but, since the latter date, only offensive military operations of a minor character have occasionally been necessary against individual offending tribes. Relations with Turkey, our most powerful neighbour, have been more troublesome. Having relinquished the Yemen for a long period, the Turks found their opportunity to intervene once more, after the evacuation of the district by the Egyptians in lo4 . In 1849 a Turkish expedition from Jiddah captured the port oRECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 197 Hodeidah and obtained possession of the Tihamah ; and during the succeeding years the Turks gradually extended their conquests inland from the coast, until, in 1873, they had reached the limits of the tribes under British influence. Thenceforward, aided by intrigue on the part of disaffected tribes or tribal sections, and taking advantage of intertribal feuds, they began to make en croachments, often temporarily successful, on Aden territory, particularly on that occupied by the Abdali, Haushabi, and Amiri confederations. In 1873 occurred the Turkish occupation of Dhala, the stronghold of the Amiri, which was continued in a greater or less degree until 1903 ; and in the earlier year the Turks even occupied for a time the fortified house of the 'Abdali Sultan at Lahej. Though Turkish aggression subsequently made itself felt to some extent all along the Aden-Yemen frontier, it has always been particularly active in the Amiri and Haushabi country. In 1900 trouble occurred between the Turkish tribe of Humar and the Haushabi. The representative of Turkish authority, Mohammed Nasir Muqbil, an Arab of Humar origin, came to an understanding with the Abdali Sultan and erected a tower at Kafuf, about two miles north-west of Darajah, well within Haushabi limits, from which he and his Humar following were able to cause considerable annoyance to the Haushabi. Representations to the Turkish authority having failed to obtain more than promises of evacuation, a British force was dispatched to help the Haushabi in ejecting them. In the meanwhile Nasir, by representing to the Turkish authorities at Ta'izz that the British force intended to commit wanton aggression on Turkish territory, induced them to dispatch a force of 400 men, who proceeded to Kafuf and occupied the tower. The Humar, who held the heights of Darajah, were, however, put to flight and the Turks evacuated the place. As a consequence of this incident, the Porte, which had previously rejected offers of demarcation of the frontier, itself proposed it. The offer was accepted and British and Turkish Commissioners met at Dhala in January 1902. Negotiations proceeded slowly owing to obstruction by the Turks and to the fact that they persisted in oc cupying Jalilah within the Aden border. Eventually it was found necessary to exert pressure. A strong British supporting column was dispatched to Dhala, and, after some time, the Turks withdrew to Qa'tabah and the work of delimitation proceeded. It was com pleted in May 1904, and since that date until the present war our relations with the Turks in this region have not been unfriendly. On the outbreak of war with Turkey, on October 31st, 1914, reports indicated that the Turks were in some strength in the Sheikh198 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR Sa'id Peninsula and that they were preparing to dispatch troops to act against the Aden Protectorate. Consequently early in November three Indian infantry battalions, then on the voyage to Suez, were ordered to capture Sheikh Sa'id and destroy the Turkish works, arma ments, and wells at that place. On November 10th the transports con veying the force arrived off the coast of the Sheikh Sa'id Peninsula; but adverse weather conditions prevented a landing at the point first selected. Covered by the fire of naval guns,-a landing was effected elsewhere, all opposition encountered was overcome, and the enemy was driven inland, abandoning his field guns. On November 11th Turbah Fort and other Turkish works in the neigh bourhood were destroyed by the troops with the assistance of a naval demolition party. — For some time after these operations the Turks showed no signs of advancing with a view to attacking Aden ; but their presence on the northern boundary of the Protectorate rendered it desirable to strengthen the garrison at Aden. Sheikh Sa'id was again occupied by them, and on the night of June 14th-15th, 1915, they endeavoured to effect a landing on the north coast of Perim ; but this attack was successfully driven off by the garrison of the island. During the latter half of that month reports indicated a possible Turkish advance on Lahej from Mawiyah. On definite information being received that such an advance was about to be made, the Aden movable column was ordered to move out to Sheikh 'Othman on the evening of July 3rd. Early the following morning the advance was continued to Lahej, to which place the Aden troops had pre viously been dispatched. The intense heat, sand, and shortage of water rendered the march and the subsequent operations most trying, but, in spite of these hindrances, the advance guard reached their objective and engaged the Turks just beyond Lahej on the evening of July 4th. But the desertion of the hired camels and the severe climatic conditions so delayed and distressed the main body as to necessitate, on July 5th, a withdrawal from Lahej to Khor Maksar. After the withdrawal the Turks occupied Sheikh 'Othman, and it was decided to increase temporarily the Aden garrison. On July 20th, after reinforcements had been received, the Aden troops with two batteries of artillery moved out of the town to attack the enemy next morning. The Turks, completely surprised, were expelled from Sheikh 'Othman with considerable loss, and several hundred prisoners, mostly Arabs, were taken. In August a small column engaged the garrison of the Turkish post of FiyufW) eight miles north of Sheikh 'Othman, and forced the enemy to retire on Lahej ; and a few days later another successful reconnaissanceRECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 199 was made towards Waht. On the receipt of reports in September that the Turks were preparing to retire from Lahej, a column sur prised the enemy, estimated at 700 Turks with eight guns and 1,000 Arabs, and seized and occupied Waht. In October and again in December our cavalry had small affairs with hostile recon noitring parties, in which the latter were driven off with loss ; and in December friendly Arabs, supported by a small infantry detachment, drove off a hostile Turkish and Arab force which was advancing on Tmad. Owing to the Turks dispatching troops to coerce the tribes in the east of the Aden Protectorate, a demonstration in support of these tribes was made by the Aden movable column on January 12th, 1916, in the direction of Subar. The column located a Turkish force near Subar, about 4 m. SSE. of Lahej, and engaged it, inflicting considerable losses on it. As a result of this action the Turkish pressure on the Arab tribes is reported to have been relieved. Since then there has been little change. The strength of the principal tribal units and the political attitude of their rulers are described in the sections on the Tribal Con federations (pp. 206 ff.). DISTRICTS AND TOWNS I. Aden Settlement The Settlement of Aden comprises the following divisions: (1) the peninsula and isthmus, or Aden proper, which has an area of about 21 square miles and a population, in 1915, of 36,900 ; (2) Sheikh 'Othman and the district round, inclusive of the villages of 'Imad and Hiswah, which has an area of 39 square miles and a popula tion of 7,700 ; (3) Little Aden peninsula, with 15 square miles of area and population 330 ; and (4) the island of Perim, with 5 square miles of area and population 1,300. The total area of the Settle ment is therefore about 80 square miles, with a total population of just over 46,000 souls. The British territory was at first limited to the peninsula of Aden proper, and extended only to Kh5r Maksar creek, which forms the neck of the peninsula two miles north of the defensive works across the isthmus. In 1868 the peninsula of Little Aden, or Jebel Ihsan, was acquired by purchase from the Sultan of the 'Aqrabi. In 1882, owing to the increasing population of Aden town, a further small tract of territory was acquired by purchase, from the Sultan of Lahej, beyond the Khor Maksar creek, extending to just beyond the small village of 'Imad on the north and just beyond the town200 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR of Sheikh 'Othman and small village of Hiswahon the north-east, at a radius roughly of ten miles from Aden town. The island of Socotra, in the Arabian Sea, passed under the protection of the British Government in virtue of a treaty concluded with the Sultan of Mahrah in 1886 (p. 205). The peninsula of Aden proper is an irregular oval, 15 miles in circumference, with a diameter of from 3 to 5 miles, connected with the mainland by a neck of land about 1,350 yards wide, but at one place nearly covered at high spring tides. The causeway and aqueduct, however, are always above, although at some seasons only just above, water level. The peninsula consists of a huge crater walled round by precipices, the highest point being 1,775 feet above the sea ; and rugged spurs, with valleys between, radiate from the centre. A great gap in the circumference of the crater has been rent on its eastern sea-face by some later volcanic disturbance. The town of Aden and part of the military cantonment lie within the crater, and consequently are surrounded on all sides by rocky hills. Lavas, spongy breccias, and tufas form the materials of this volcanic -fortress. The natural vegetation is very scanty and resembles that of Arabia Petrsea. The average shade temperature of Aden is 87°—the mean monthly range being from 75° in January to 98° in June, with occasional variations up to or exceeding 102°. The lulls between the monsoon periods, in May and September, are specially oppressive. The mortality among Europeans, although greatly increased by the sick or dying from the passengers and crews of ships, amounts to only 7*2 per thousand. Aden, in fact, ranks as a rather healthy station for troops, though on first arrival they are subject to sandfly- fever, and it is a well-ascertained fact that long residence impairs the faculties and undermines the constitution of Europeans. The climate during the north-east monsoon, or from October to April, is cool and pleasant, particularly in November, December, and January. During the remainder of the year (the period of the south-west monsoon), hot sandy winds, known as (north), prevail within the crater, but on the western or Steamer Point side the breezes come directly off the sea and are fairly cool. The rainfall may be said to vary from J inch to 8| inches, with an irregular average of about 3 inches ; the irregularity and smallness of the yearly rainfall is borne out by the fact that the tanks, since their restoration in 1856, have only been filled six times—in May 1866 and 1870, and September 1877, 1889, 1893, and 1897. The Settlement is exceptionally free from infectious diseases and epi demics. The absence of vegetation, the dryness of the soil, and theDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 201 purity of the drinking water constitute efficient safeguards against many maladies common to tropical countries. The harbour of Aden—the Bandar Tawiyah, or Aden West Bay, but more generally known as Aden Back Bay—lies between the two lofty peninsulas, very like in appearance, of Jebel Sham- shan (east) and Jebel Ihsan (west); it extends eight miles from east to west and four from north to south, and is divided into two bays by a spit of land. The depth of water in the western bay is from 3 to 4 fathoms, and, across the entrance, from to 5 fathoms. There are several islands in the inner bay, notably Jezirah Sawayih (Slave Island), which culminates in a peak 300 ft. in altitude. The port of Aden is a great coaling-station and place of call for vessels passing to and from the Suez Canal. Large vessels lie off Steamer Point, the western extremity of Jebel Ihsan. The Penin sular and Oriental Navigation Company's steamers call weekly at the port to receive, tranship, or land passengers and mails, and it is a port of call for a number of other important lines. There are numerous lights and lightships, the chief being the Aden Cape Light at Ras Marshag, on the east of the Ihsan peninsula, visible for 20 miles, and the Elephant's Back Light on the summit of a headland, visible also for 20 miles ; the Aden Lightship, not far from Steamer Point, is visible for 10 miles, and fires a gun whenever a vessel enters the harbour at night. Of the total population of the Aden Settlement (46,000), about 23,000 are returned as Arabs and there is a large number of Somalis. These two sections do the hard work of the port, but among the Arabs there are a few merchants of substance. Almost every nationality is also represented : Hindus, Parsees, Persians, Chinese, Abyssinians, Jews, &amp;c. The Parsees have annexed a very con siderable portion of the trade, for they act as agents and shop keepers, and their business talent equals that of the Jews. Classified otherwise, European residents and Christians number from 2,000 to 3,000 ; Mohammedans, 34,000 ; and Jews, 3,700. The natives have an untidy makeshift air which contrasts with the personal cleanliness of an Indian population, and this arises partly from the scarcity of water, and partly from the temporary nature of their residence and outdoor life. As far as the Settlement is concerned, there are no natural products whatever with the exception of salt. The food of the whole popu lation, civil and military, is imported, Aden producing not even a blade of grain. Rice comes from Calcutta, Bombay, and Malabar ; jowari, bajri, and maize are brought on camels from the interior; fodder and firewood come from the Lahej and Eadhli districts.202 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR The chief local industries are ; salt preparing ; the unhusking of i®® coffee ; and cigarette making. The first is obtained, as elsewhere li* by evaporating sea-water in shallow pans, in a stretch of ground W situated near Sheikh 'Othman, and the industry, which is considerable (over 100 tons were exported in 1915), is in the hands of the t in Italian Salt Company. The unhusking of the coffee berries is done Up almost entirely in Aden, before transhipment and export. The water-supply forms, perhaps, the most important problem lab at Aden : it is obtained from four sources—wells, aqueducts, tanks ntali or reservoirs, and condensers. It has been found that the most W reliable means of supply is by condensing, and but little drinking tw water is now drawn from wells and aqueducts. Of there are lifi many, both within and without the British limits : the former are fiiiii sunk in the solid rock of the peninsula often to a depth of from 120 « to 190 ft. and the water is of good quality ; the latter are around jitlii Sheikh 'Othman and Hiswah and the water is of only fair quality, but top brought largely into Aden for domestic purposes among the natives, riia In 1867 the British Government obtained permission from the Ik Sultan of Lahej to construct an aque from two of his best wells isla in the village of Sheikh 'Othman. The water is received in large 1. reserve tanks inside the fortifications and is thence distributed to side the troops and establishments and to the public in limited quantities fa at one rupee per 100 gallons. It is of indifferent quality and fit ffflii only for purposes of ablution. sep The expediency of constructing in which to store rain- tp water was recognized in Arabia at a very early date; they are iag widely found in districts devoid of springs, which depend on the itl winter rains for a supply of water during drought (cp. Yemen, ffldi Chap. VI). The most remarkable instance on record is perhaps the loafe great dam at Mareb (see p. 176). There is no trustworthy record «k of the construction of the Aden reservoirs, but they are supposed to have been begun at the time of the second Persian invasion of out, j Yemen, about a.d . 600. In the early part of the nineteenth century, liifel though some few were in a tolerably perfect state of preservation, lie many had been partially destroyed by the people, who carried away -•■4 the stones for building purposes ; others had been filled with debris fcin washed down from the hills by the rain. In 1856 the restoration H of these magnificent public works was begun, and thirteen have been 'siiit-l completed, capable of holding nearly 8 million gallons of water, it in A very moderate fall of rain suffices to send down the numerous Ci; steep rocky ravines, by which the peninsula is intersected, stupen- 4® dous torrents of water, and it is to intercept and store this water \ that the reservoirs have been constructed. They are so arranged ^DISTRICTS AND TOWNS 203 in series that the overflow of one reservoir may be conducted into the succeeding one, and thus a complete chain has been formed. Of late years it has been the practice to put the tanks up to auction for a definite period, the highest bidder trusting to a good fall of rain to recoup his outlay. The water collected used to be sold at R. 1 per 100 gallons, and, when the tanks are full, the annual revenue amounts to Rs. 30,000 ; but when the rain fails, and the tanks are exhausted, a skin containing 5 gallons of brackish well- water has at times sold for 8 annas. Shortly before the opening of the Suez Canal the Government foresaw the necessity of obtaining a plentiful and unfailing supply of good water, and in 1867 several on the most approved principle, were ordered out from England. Six condensers are now worked bythe Government and private companies, capable of yielding 52,000 gallons a day, or a sufficient supply for 10,400 Europeans at 5 gallons per head. In 1903-4 condensed water was sold at about R. 1| per 100 gallons. The foil ow ing are the principal towns of the district, with adjacent islands : 1. Aden Town comprises Aden situated on the eastern side of the peninsula, with a population of some 20,000 ; and Tawdhi, the port at Steamer Point on the western side of the peninsula, containing some 700 to 800 houses. The two parts are separated by a distance of about four miles and connected by a good carriage-road. Half-way between them lies the important village of Ma'la, consisting partly of stone houses but chiefly of mat huts occupied largely by Somalis ; here the local craft anchor, and nearly all the native trade of the Aden interior is shipped and loaded. Aden proper faces north-east and consists of some 2,000 or more whitewashed houses of stone or mud, few of which are noteworthy for their architecture. The streets are regularly laid out, and the whole town has been practically rebuilt since the British occupation. The dry bed of a water-course runs down to the sea from the valley in which the reservoirs are situated, and divides the town into two nearly equal parts ; it serves to carry off the surplus of water when the reservoirs happen to overflow. The only building of any pretension in Aden proper contains the court-house and treasury office ; the barracks are commodious but not handsome ; the Protestant church, erected in 1869, is situated on a hill; and there is a Roman Catholic convent, which, among its other activities, gives shelter to emancipated slave-girls. The bazaars are extensive, and are notable for the melley of strange peoples, in gorgeous and varied costumes, to be seen there. One of11 ill; 11: I 204 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR the sights of Aden is the tunnel, about 350 yards in length, which runs under the Mansuri hills and connects the town with the isthmus TawdU, the port, lies immediately to the east of Steamer Point, and is practically a new and prosperous-looking town consisting largely of fair-sized stone houses, nearly all of which are double or treble storied. Here are good hotels, a police station, a court-house, a local post and telegraph office, military establishments of various kinds, a hospital, the offices of the great steamship companies, and the offices of the port authorities, and here also are situated the great coal wharves and the landing and other piers. On a conical hill about a quarter of a mile from the post office stands the station flagstaff, and near this the road crosses the spur on which the barracks are situated. After traversing a plain of about 500 yards in extent in a south-westerly direction, the road terminates on Has Tarshein, the most westerly point of the peninsula, on which are built the Residency and the quarters of the officers of the Royal Artillery. ^ Aden has two hospitals and three dispensaries for the civilian part of the population. Separate military hospitals are maintained for the garrison. Until recently land in the Settlement was not sold: sites for building and gardens were granted in perpetuity, and sites for stacking coal and salt, for beaching boats, for ships, workshops, &amp;c., were given on leases for a term of 99 years on payment of quit rent. Since 1911, land for building, agricultural, or other purposes is ordinarily to be granted on lease, but may be disposed of otherwise at the discretion of the Resident. Land on the fore shore of the harbour can be granted only with the sanction of the Government and on such terms as it may prescribe in each case. The roads in and around Aden are not good in general; they are narrow with steep gradients, and though there is plenty of rock in Aden, good stone for metalling purposes is difficult to obtain and there is but little soil for binding purposes. They are, therefore, very gritty and easily crumble. Aden has no railways, but it is un rivalled for its telegraphic facilities with all parts : there are direct cables with Bombay, Zanzibar, Perim, and Suez, and indirectly therefore with all parts of the world. The telegraph station is on Ras Boradli. 2. Sheikh 4 Othman is a thriving and populous town, situated six miles north by west of Aden and two miles beyond the Aden troop lines at Kh5r Maksar ; it is reached by a broad carriage- road. The town contains several large caravanserais, some Euro pean houses, and some bungalows and gardens. There are about 15 wells lof brackish water and of unlimited supply, some of whichDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 205 are tapped for Aden, an aqueduct leading from them along the peninsula into the town (see p. 202). There are very large camping- grounds round the town, the place forming the terminus of many caravan routes from the Aden interior. Sheikh 'Othman was purchased with the object of settling there the surplus population of the peninsula, but, owing to its inaccessibihty and the un- healthiness due to its contaminated water-supply and want of a drainage system, it has so far failed to become a popular settlement. 3. 'Imad, a miserable village of about 40 reed huts, marks the extreme eastern limit of Aden; it is peopled by the Salum, a small independent tribe. 4. Perim and Socotra. These two islands are attached to the settlement of Aden. Perim is a volcanic island in the straits of Bab el-Mandeb, 1^ miles from the Arabian coast; it was occupied by the British in 1799, subsequently abandoned, and reoccupied in 1857 on the opening of the overland route. In 1883 a company (the Perim Coal Company) was formed, which obtained a concession on the south-western side of the island as a site for a coahng-station. The company maintains here a stock of Welsh coal varying from 5,000 to 10,000 tons, and a large number of vessels now call annually for supplies. There is a good harbour with a powerful flashing light, elevated 266 ft. and with a range of over 22 miles. The population in 1901 was about 1,200, and no one is allowed to reside on the island without the permission of the Resident. - The island is bare and rocky, rather flat in appearance, and about 3 miles long by 2 wide. Socotra is distant about 130 miles from the nearest point of the Arabian coast, and some 500 miles from Aden. It is about 70 miles in length and 18 miles in width, and has an unbroken coast on the southern side. The interior may be described as a tableland from 700 to 1,900 ft. high (with rugged peaks rising to nearly 5,000 ft.), surrounded by a coast plain averaging from two to four miles in width; total area about 1,400 square miles ; population about 12,000. Its principal products are gum and resin-producing plants and aloes ; the island has been famous for the latter from the earliest times. The natives look for their chief means of support to their flocks and date-groves ; melons, beans, and a little tobacco are also grown. The trade of the island is small, the chief exports being aloes and ghi. The capital is Tamrida, situated on the northern shore. The island was formally placed under British protection in 1886, and the Sultan receives a stipend from the Government of 360 dollars, undertaking to enter into no arrangement with any foreign power without the sanction of the British Government. The Muria Islands, near the South Arabian coast, in long. 56° E., were206 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR ceded to the British by the Sultan of Muscat in 1854, and were ^ valuable only for the guano deposits found upon them, since A exhausted (see further, Ch. VIII, p. 283). alffl mil II. The Tribal Confederations Many of these occupy very considerable territory, but their limits and extent are vague and in no sense clearly defined; they are, further, subject to local variation with the changes in tribal power and the ebb and flow of politics. The system of internal tribal administration varies greatly, both in nature and degree, in the different districts. In the majority of the Confederations the ruler's authority over most of his subjects, with the exception of his per sonal retainers and entourage, is very slight. The Sultan of the 'Abddli exercises a more absolute authority over his tribe than other rulers, with the exception, perhaps, of the Sultan of the The chief of the Haushabi, if a ruler of strong will, would, both from the nature of his country and the character of his people, wield much the same authority over the majority of his tribe. In the Amiri country, which is a confederacy of various small tribes, the Emir's authority is only absolute over a comparatively small pro portion. The Upper Ydfa' Sultan has little or no authority over his tribe so far as administration is concerned. Of the several of the sub-tribes are independent. The have several rulers, while many of the outlying and nomadic tribes are practically beyond the control of their Sultans. The are a law unto themselves. It will be seen, therefore, that the term ' administra tion ' cannot be strictlv applied to so heterogeneous a collection of peoples. In the matter of revenue, that derived from the tribesmen is mainly from two sources—the collection of or tithes, and dues on market sales—both payable to the Sultan or Emir. Beyond this, revenue in some districts is derived from dues on passing caravans. The scale of charges varies with the nature of the commodity carried : two dollars per camel load would, for example, be exacted for the passage of a caravan carrying coffee from Ta izz to Aden through 'Abdali territory. The towns and settlements are built in general with provision for defence, but of fortresses, properly speaking, there are none in the interior. Nearly all Arab villages in the mountains consist of solidly built stone towers, almost invariably placed in commanding ] ,l)S1 ' tions, and, when occasion requires, necessitating destruction by artillery or demolition by gun-cotton. The towers are invariablyDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 207 loopholed for musketry, and, if stubbornly held, an attack without artillery would prove costly. They are generally square in shape and are sometimes so built as to provide flanking fire on the door ; and they are usually two or three stories in height with a flat roof protected by a parapet. The villages are not surrounded by walls, but the erection of sangars would quickly convert them into positions very difficult for infantry to capture unsupported by artillery. Villages in the plains are occasionally strengthened by a mud wall. The coast towns of Makalla and Shiheir are fortified, chiefly against attacks by Bedouins from the land side, and are quite open to artillery fire from the sea. (a) Confederations within the limits of the Aden Protectorate are described in the following order. : Subeihi, ' Abdali, Fadhli, and 'Aqrabi; Interior : Haushabi, Dhambari, Amiri, and 'Alawi. i. Subeihi. This tribe occupies an extensive littoral tract in the south-west comer of Arabia. Although covering a large area, their territory is but sparsely inhabited and consists mainly of sandy wastes with an occasional well and a little cultivation here and there. The Subeihi are consequently nomadic : they have no Sultan nor head Sheikh, and are divided into a large number of petty clans, among which maybe mentioned the Mansuri and Rujei. The clans have very little cohesion, and blood-feuds frequently occur between them : of all the tribes in the neighbourhood of Aden the Subeihi approach nearest to the typical Bedouin character. The Sultan of the 'Abdali sometimes exercises a certain amount of in fluence on the clans of the eastern section of the Subeihi, and those in proximity to the Yemen border come under Turkish influence. Many members of the tribe earn a livelihood as muqaddams, or leaders of caravans which pass from other districts through the Subeihi country en route for Aden. The population is estimated at 19,500. Though they are mainly pastoral and nomadic, they are reputed to be able to muster a large number of fighting men, expert raiders but unsteady in battle. The people as a whole are treacherous and untrustworthy and much given to interference with caravans passing through their territory. When the Turks advanced against Aden, the Subeihi lost no time in joining them and took part in the attack on Lahej in July 1915. Their settlements are few; Rija, a small fortified village, 20 miles west of Lahej, is the centre of the Rujei. ii. 'Abddli. This tribe occupies the country immediately around and behind Aden, its boundary extending about 35 miles inland208 ADEN AND THE INTEEIOE to the territory of the Haushabi and having the Subeihi on the west and the Eadhli on the east. The chief of the tribe is the Sultan of Lahej, who, normally, possesses great influence in the interior and exercises sovereignty over certain sections of the Subeihi. He receives a yearly subsidy of Rs. 12,984 from the British Government for its occupation of the town of Sheikh 'Othman. The estimated population is 14,500, including about 2,000 men of doubtful fighting value. The people are agricultural rather than warlike, and, occupying one of the most fertile tracts of southern Arabia, are by far the wealthiest of the tribes bordering on Aden, They and the Eadhli breed camels that are noted for their fleetness and carrying powers. They possess more settled habitations than most of their neighbours of the littoral. The chief towns and settlements of the Abdali district are: 1. Lahej, 21 miles from Aden, with a population estimated variously at from 10,000 to 15,000, is a town with narrow irregular streets, nearly all the houses being surrounded by zaribas into which the cattle are driven at night. The most notable feature of the town is the market, Lahej being the most important commercial centre, outside Aden, of the whole district. The town forms an advanced market for fabrics and manufactured articles from Aden, and, in return, supplies Aden with fodder, vegetables, and firewood, Transit dues are levied here on the Yemen trade, the chief articles being coffee and Icat. There is an important community of native blacksmiths and craftsmen in metal-work, who turn out daggers, sword-blades, spear-heads, matchlocks, and domestic hardware and utensils, of rough workmanship, especially the decorative work in silver. The bazaars are covered in and one is set apart for the workers in metals. The town stands amid date plantations and groves of lime, orange, banana, and coco-nut palms, which extend for miles, and in consequence the climate is particularly damp and malarial. The water is very bad. The palace of the Sultan, on the southern edge of the town, is the most imposing building on the littoral belt. It is of mixed arclii- tecture, from Italian stucco to Arab, built partly of sun-dried brick and partly of cement and stone masonry, and it is constantly being added to. It overlooks a large open square where the Sultan reviews his troops and has a saluting battery holding two guns of Crimean pattern. 2. Dar el-Amir, situated a little to the north of Sheikh 'Othman, is the 'Abdali customs post for the Aden traffic. iii. Fadhli. A large tribe, of warlike and independent character, inhabiting the sea-board from the British frontier post at 'Imad toDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 209 Maqatin, and extending inland to the maritime ranges. The population is estimated at under 20,000, with a high proportion of fighting men, who are probably well armed owing to their large sea-board and resources. The people are agricultural as well as pastoral, their territory including the extensive tract of fertile land known as the Abiyan ; they are noted for breeding swift camels of good carrying capabilities. Relations between the Fadhli and Yafa' are often strained, as the latter sometimes cut off the water- supply of the Bana River, while, on their side, the Fadhli have established customs posts and levy dues on Yafa' caravans. The ruling Sultan, Husein ibn Hamid, an old man of 90, visited Aden late in 1915 ; in January 1916 he was summoned to Lahej by 'Ali Sa id Pasha, given a guard of honour and salute of guns, and promised a bribe if he would support the Turks. But the attitude of this Sultan, apart from Turkish pressure, has been Anglophile. The chief towns and settlements of the Sultanate' of Fadhli are : 1. Shughrah (Shuqrah), the capital and the principal port between Aden and Makalla, is situated about 100 miles north-east of Aden, and occupies an important position on the convergence of several caravan routes from north and east, which enables it to collect considerable transit dues, and, if the Sultan so desires, to hamper trade generally. The town is divided into two parts, the palace and other chief buildings being in the easterly portion, which lies about half a mile from the fishing and commercial quarter. It has a large fishing industry and constitutes a focus of trade between Aden and the Upper Yafa' and 'Aulaqi districts. The population is about 5,000. There is a small harbour, with a depth of from 1 to 2| fathoms, formed by a break in the reef which fronts the shore at about five cables' distance ; outside the reef is good anchorage in 7 to 9 fathoms. The exports are chiefly ambergris, coffee, and ghi. The Wadi Math wan finds an outlet to the sea just east of the town, and, though it is generally dry, flood-water sometimes comes down at very short notice. Jowari is cultivated in consider able quantities, and there is a large date-grove not far from the town. On the left bank of the wadi are salt-works. The Sultan of Fadhli has a country residence at Suriyah about 20 miles east and 4 miles inland. 2. Maqatin (es-Saghir, a little distance inland; and el - Kebir, on the coast) is composed mainly of ruins. There is now no per manent settlement there, but only a shrine with a small cemetery a - ru / nec ^ tower. The site marks the eastern limit of the adhli tribe. Fisher folk, who use the place as a base for their arabia i o210 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR operations at certain seasons of the year, have constructed a few crude shelters. 3. Na'ib (Naab) is a considerable collection of settlements, com prising Old and New Na'ib, Suwat, Nujat, and other villages. They are situated in a highly cultivated plain irrigated by a system of water-channels from a more or less permanent stream in the fertile Wadi Yeramis, a tributary of Wadi Hasan. Old Na'ib, on the left side of the wadi, has a mosque with a conspicuous minaret. New Na'ib, on the right bank, sometimes known as Raudhah, stands on a low plateau of earth cliffs ; it is an important centre of traffic, and has several shops, a fine old house falling into ruin, and a custom house for the collection of dues on merchandise passing to and from the Yafa' country. The immediate approach to the village is by a roundabout way through narrow gullies. iv. 'Aqrabi, a small, peaceably disposed tribe occupying the coastal district north-west of Aden Lagoon. Their territory, poor for cultivation, is separated by a desert tract from that of the 'Abdali, under whose influence they are. It is impossible to give an estimate of their population, but, though they are mainly pas toral, they are considered capable of furnishing some 260 fighting men. The district contains no town of any importance. Bir Ahmed, the tribal capital, is situated about one mile west of Wadi Kebir and due west of Sheikh 'Othman, and the tall tower of the Sultan's residence can be plainly seen from Aden harbour. During the recent operations it would appear that pressure from their powerful northern neighbours, the Subeihi, and from the Turks, forced the 'Aqrabi temporarily to side with the latter. v. Haushabi. This is a powerful tribe whose territory extends from near the Anglo-Turkish frontier to Nubat Dakim and the 'Abdali territory. They are, generally, peaceably disposed, and, although of late years they have done a good deal of fighting with their neighbours, they do not come under the heading of war like tribes. They control the Tiban valley and consequently the waters of the Lahej oasis, and have on several occasions, in time of war, been known to divert the course of the water : but relations between the Haushabi and the 'Abdali have been for the most par friendly. The population is estimated at from 6,000 to 7,(K) (including 1,800 fighting men) ; they are mostly nomads, but a few are engaged in agriculture and camel-driving. The tribe is under the nominal rule of a Sultan, who claims, a so, suzerainty over the Dhdmbari, a troublesome hill tribe on the eas ^ who are given to raiding, and admit his control only when it sui them. The Haushabi Sultan threw in his lot with the Turks, w,fo7 DISTRICTS AND TOWNS 211 i ' tl they appeared in 1915, and accompanied them in their attack on Aden. The towns and villages of the Haushabi country are small and t lk! ; badly built, each consisting of one or two towers and a cluster of * stone hovels. The following are the chief settlements : 1. Musemir (Mus'aimir), the capital, about 60 miles north by west of Aden and 12 miles from the Yemen border, lies on a small plateau • ® overlooking the left bank of the Wadi Tiban, and is a centre of im- f: portant caravan tracks. The residence of the Sultan is a large M tower of stone and mud, some 75 ft. square and 40 ft. high. With * the exception of one other tower, the only other habitations are a cluster of reed huts where his soldiers and slaves live. The pi district is most unhealthy. 2. 'Anad, in the fork between the Wadis Tiban and Bilih, V is a frontier town of the Haushabi. The fort is a large square mud W building, two storeys in height. yi. Amiri. The territory of this tribe, about 750 sq. miles in # extent, lies between Wadis Tiban and Bana, to the north-east of iJF that of the Haushabi. It extends to the frontier of Yemen, and is Ifj of a very mountainous and rugged character. The Emir also claims Btt J suzerainty over the Quteibi to the south-east, but he cannot enforce l«i ! it. The population is estimated at 6,000, and is mostly pastoral and agricultural. Though the tribe is said to be able to muster 1,000 fighting men (this seems excessive), they are of doubtful value as combatants. In 1915 the Turks deprived the Emir of his position i* for a time ; later they summoned him to Lahej, and, keeping his son there as a hostage, reinstated him and gave him fifty rifles. The chief settlements of the Amiri district are : 1. Dhala, which has a population of about 2,400, and is by far the 4.1 most important town of this tribe. The residence of the Emir, Sufil called Dar el-Ha'id, consists of a small group of ddrs, or square jilt stone towers, and stands on the top of a rocky hill. The town eal itself clusters at the northern foot of the hill, and partly up its lim slopes, about 200 ft. below. It is compactly built and consists of itll about 325 houses, most of which are solidly constructed stone mii three or four storeys in height; the streets are narrow, dirty, and to| irregular. On the western side of the town is an open space where l it a market, attended by people from the neighbouring district, is held on Thursdays ; on the eastern side is a smaller space where skins 0 a ^ e dried and cured. The Jews, who have two separate quarters jlliii of unpretentious houses, spin thread for weaving. On the northern [{ j|s side of the town is the principal mosque, with a white-topped jjlii minaret; and there are several outlying ddrs on slight eminences. 02212 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR The town stands at the head of an open, high lying valley extend ing about ten miles from north to south and having an average width of three miles. Much of the valley is well watered and wooded, and the ground, right up to the town, is terraced for culti vation. The place is the centre of a great number of caravan routes and minor tracks. Many of these, however, are steep and difficult, especially towards the north, and the approaches to the town, in general, are far from easy. 2. Jalilah is a village of tall, clean, solid, stone-built houses, some running to four storeys, and is one of the most populous settle ments of the district. It is poised on a hill over 300 ft. above the surrounding plain, and is an important caravan halt on routes between Aden and Yemen. An indigo-dye industry is carried on. It has a fort and round tower, near the Turkish frontier. vii. 'Alawi, a small tribe occupying territory between that of the Amiri on the north and the Haushabi on the south. The whole tract does not, probably, exceed 40 sq. miles in extent, and the population is estimated at 1,500. In January 1916 they are said to have submitted to the Turks, together with their neighbours, the Quteibi, with whom they are on unfriendly terms. Suleiq, 55 miles north of Aden, is their chief town, and comprises two villages, one on the right bank of the Hardaba, below a defensible ' serai generally known as Fort Suleiq, and another on a ridge about 400 yards away and situated considerably higher than the fort. With regard to the character of the tribes of the maritime hills, as a whole, contrasted with those of the littoral, a recent traveller says : ' They are the scourge of the lowlands and the pariahs of the more organized races farther north. Treacherous, dishonest, and covetous—without the courage and cohesion for open raids driven home by the force of arms, they waylay and murder the defenceless travellers, and will even betray the guest they have undertaken to protect. They steal cattle and other stock at night—prefemng speedy beasts such as saddle-camels, and, lacking in expert h orse ' manship, rely on stealth and cunning rather than dash and boldness. All the same they are stubborn fighters, especially if the day is going against them—fighting desperately and with judgement when cornered, and are skilful skirmishers and possess remarkabe mobility. They carry on guerilla warfare with effect, harass troop^ by incessant sniping, but decline open engagement and are cleve at ambuscade. They are difficult for ordinary Europeans handle and are not a reliable type or satisfactory for ai service.' tww - {b) Tribal Confederations beyond the limits of the Aden xrDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 213 torate proper are the Yafa', 'Aulaqi, Beida, Oleh, and the 'Audillah (or 'Audali). i. Ydfa'. This warlike confederation, consisting of the Upper and Lower Yafa', holds a very extensive inland territory, north of the Fadhli, immediately to the east of the Protectorate boundary, and having the Beida Sultanate to the north-east. The Upper Yafa' occupy the northern, and the Lower the southern portion of the territory, the former being the more extensive. The Yafa' country is watered by the Bana and Hasan rivers. The interior is mountainous, but there are many fertile valleys producing coffee, gums, madder, and cereals. The five powerful clans of the Upper Yafa' are the Mausata, Dhubi, Maflahi, Bo'si, and Da'udi; the chief clans of the Lower Yafa' are the Kaladi, Yahari, Sadi, and Yazidi. The population of the Confederation is estimated at 108,000 : the Upper Yafa' have a fighting strength of some 15,000 men ; and the Lower Yafa' a total pop. of 28,000, with 6,600 fighting men. The people are hardy mountaineers, always ready for active service, which they often seek in other parts of the Islamic world, e. g. at Haidarabad, Zanzibar, fee. The tribe, however, falls short of the political importance which might be expected of so large a con federation, as it lacks cohesion and uniform policy. The Confedera tion has, in fact, no one paramount Sultan, but several chieftains, each urging paramount claims. The Lower Yafa', alone, may be considered as a separate sultanate, but their present chief lives much in seclusion, being dissatisfied with the attitude towards himself of certain sections of the Upper Yafa' (over whom he is inclined to assert a claim to general suzerainty) and with the dignity and prece dence assigned to him. The Upper Yafa' have held aloof from the Turks up to the present and have refused to entertain advances which have been made both by them and by the Imam of Yemen. The following are some of the chief towns of the Yafa': 1. Yafa', said to be ' the principal capital town '. 2. Gharrah, one hundred miles inland from Shughrah, and the principal residence of the Sultan of the Lower Yafa'. 3. Khanfar is a well-to-do town in the Abiyan district, situated on a very ancient site a mile or so east of the Wadi Bana, on large mounds near some dilapidated forts and an old ruined castle. The Sultan possesses another castle at a short distance from the town. Khanfar has a powder factory of a primitive kind, saltpetre being plentiful in the district. Jebel Jabeil, a neighbouring hill about 200 ft. high, is the acropolis of ancient Khanfar and is surmounted by a large double-walled fort, the outer wall being built of large hewn stones. The fort commands the town.214 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR 4. Bir Lamas, having a plentiful supply of water in a district where it is otherwise very scarce, is an important and very dirty halting-place for caravans between Shughrah and Nisab. The place itself is a picturesque spot, with acacia-trees overhung with creepers. Mis-hal and many other villages are supplied with drinking-water from here, the labour of carrying it being confined to the women. ii. ■ 'Aulagi. This is a very large tribal confederation whose terri tory extends from the coast of the Gulf of Aden to the Ruba' el- Khali ; it is bounded on the west by the Fadhli (where the frontier reaches to within 30 miles of Shughrah), the 'Audillah, and the Beida territories, and on the east by the Wahidi Sultanate. The country is divided for political purposes into the Sultanates of the Upper and the Lower 'Aulaqi, but these maintain close intertribal relationship and unite in the event of aggression from outside. The Upper 'Aulaqi are again subdivided, part of them being under the Sultan, and part under a Sheikh who is almost as powerful. The Lower 'Aulaqi territory, which is the more thickly populated, is composed almost entirely of the Ba Kazim and Lakmush tribes with their numerous subdivisions. The political attitude, of the Upper 'Aulaqi at least, is Anglophile. No estimate of the population of the Upper 'Aulaqi can be given, though the tribe is said to include good fighting men; that of the Lower 'Aulaqi may be roughly estimated at 15,000 souls. The Upper 'Aulaqi are inclined to be predatory, while the Lower are a hardy, turbulent race, always engaged in petty feuds among themselves or raids on their immediate neighbours, and they have a bad reputation on account of their fondness for drink and their slackness in religious observance. In ordinary circumstances they are mainly pastoral and semi-nomadic, but they possess large tracts of arable land, and there is a considerable settled population in the main wadis. Among the special products of the 'Aulaqi territory are honey and the fruit of the jujube-tree. The district includes a strip of very flat coast, without harbours, extending for some 55 miles from near Maqatin to Wadi Sanam, and its territory extends about 200 miles inland. The chief towns of the Upper 'Aulaqi are : . 1. Nisab, the capital, pop. 4,000, situated in a broad and fertie plain encircled by foot-hills, at the junction of Wadis Dhura (Durra) and 'Abdan, about 100 miles crow-fly inland of Shughrah. It is al j unwalled town of white minarets and clay -dressed houses, some o the latter being of solid construction. Though there is 110 a number of warden towers are dotted here and there aboutDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 215 plain. The town has an imposing mosque, that of Sidi Mohammed, a fine piece of typical Arab architecture, with a handsome minaret and a spacious courtyard ; it is capped by innumerable white pinnacles. There are broad tracts of cultivation above the wadi confluence, notably of indigo and cotton, the latter being a bush of small growth. Cotton fabrics are made and dyed for tribal shawls, turbans, &amp;c. Nisabis the residence of the Naqib or governor, who represents the Sultan and is responsible for the maintenance of order and the collection of the custom dues of this important inland caravan centre. The Sultan himself resides at Medaq, a few miles to the south-east, where he has a castellated house crowning a prominent hill. 2. Wasat (or Wasit) is not a town in the ordinary sense of the word, but a series of small separate settlements strung out along Wadi Markhah, with a suq, about 15 miles north-west of Nisab. It is an important trading centre and is protected by forts. 3. Markhah is a large commercial town in the broad fertile wadi of the same name, with a main stronghold and minor towers that guard the outlying portions of the settlement. It is second to Nisab in importance as a centre of the dyeing industry. 4. Yeshbum, or Yeshbum Suq, stands on a low isolated hill on the right bank of the wadi of the same name, which sweeps boldly above and below the town in opposing curves forming a huge letter S. The town is walled, and is the market and nucleus of an extensive valley settlement. There is a small dyeing industry, and cotton, imported raw from Nisab, is spun here. By far the most important and characteristic product of Yeshbum valley is its honey, which it exports all over Arabia, and even to Zanzibar and India. The bees collect the honey chiefly from the blossoms and honey-dew covered leaves of the 'elb, or jujube-tree, for which the valley is famous. The fruit of this tree is the staple fruit of the valley, where it ripens in March and is dried and pounded, stone and all, for food;- The chief settlement of the Lower 'Aulaqi is 5. Ahwar &gt; the principal residence of the Sultan, which is said to have a pop. of 5,000, and lies about five miles from the coast up the Wadi Ah war (Huwar). The settlement consists of a straggling township or series of villages, adjoining the Sultan's castle. It is a backward place without industries, but stands in the centre of a large and well-watered tract of arable land ; large numbers of bullocks are reared in the district. iii. Beida. This Sultanate occupies the plateau country north216 ADEN AND THE INTERIOR of the Kaur, reaching northward to Beihan ed-Daulah; it is bounded by the Upper Yafa'i on the south-east and by the Upper 'Aulaqi on the east. It comprises a great number of sub-tribes, of which the chief are the Ahl Bunyar, Beni Yub, and Azani. The total population is not precisely known, but the Sultanate is reputed to muster from 4,000 to 5,000 fighting men. The few important towns of the Beida are the following : 1. Beihan Umm Rusas, the residence of the Sultan of Beida. 2. Dhimrah, a fortress on the Dahr Plateau, the capital of the chief of the Ahl Bunyar, the principal tribe of the Sultanate. It possesses a number of outlying towers to guard it and the neigh bouring town of Sauma'ah from attack. The town, like Sauma'ah, is noted for the manufacture of goat-hair carpets. 3. Sauma'ah (Soma), a thriving town of about 3,000 inhabitants, perhaps the most populous in the Sultanate, and the capital of the Azzani tribe, lies on the Dahr plateau, and forms the commercial centre of this upland district. iv. Oleh. This is a powerful confederation of scattered tribes occupying a district known as Dathinah, a vague term given to a high ridge which is an offshoot of the main Kaur. The limits of the tribal territory are rather obscure, the people being of a migra tory habit; but they have the Upper 'Aulaqi on the north, the Markashi (the chief tribal branch of the Fadhli confederation) on the south, the Lower 'Aulaqi on the east, and, on the west and north-west, the 'Audillah, with whom they have a hereditary feud. The Markashi claim suzerainty over the Oleh, but this is not ad mitted. The confederation has no paramount chief, and it is reputed to have about 3,000 men of good fighting qualities but undisciplined and lacking in cohesion. The principal settlements of the Oleh are * 1. Mis-hal, situated on the tableland of the same name, over 7,000 ft. in altitude. It is a considerable village, consisting of a low square ddr and several collections of brushwood huts. The Tariq el-Arqob from Shughrah (about 15 miles distant) passes here, and an important road goes east to the Hadhramaut. 2. Jiblah, a village which contains some large houses with white towers. It is surrounded by mud walls and guard -towers, and lies in the middle of an extensive tract of arable land. Close by the village is the square guard-tower of Kafl, constructed of solid masonry and with heavy stones piled loosely round the base to thwart the tribal sapper. This tower confronts the township of Jiblat el-Waznat, the main settlement of the Hasani, a branch of the Oleh Confederation whose borders approach here. Waznat isDISTRICTS AND TOWNS 217 a market town, engirdled by fighting towers. Jiblat el-Qarn, near by, is the stronghold of the El-Qarn branch, and is built on a little knoll commanding the Hasani border. 3. Mijdah, in Wadi Ruqub, a tributary wadi of the Ahwar, is a large village of some 600 inhabitants, mostly non-combatants, and is situated on the south-western spur of the Maran ridge. The shrine of Sidi 'Amr ibn Sa'id is close to the village and is a prominent landmark and a centre of pilgrimage from all parts. A spring of good water comes out near the shrine and runs through an artificially covered channel past the village. v. 'Audillah (or 'Audali). A tribe of predatory habits and abrupt manners, under a Sultan, which inhabits the Kaur el-'Audillah, west and north-west of the territory of the Oleh. The population is not known with any exactitude, but the tribe is reputed to muster 4,000 fighting men (Bent). The people, the women in particular, decorate their faces in a very grotesque manner with a red earth dye, called hisn, and some of the women dye their faces red all over. The chief town is Laudar (Loder), the capital, a white unwalled town situated on the Sa'idi plain at the foot of the Kaur el-'Audillah, and said to be ' more populous than Shibam '. It is an important centre for the littoral and highland trade of a wide region. A market is held every Wednesday, and is attended by all the outlying tribes of the neighbouring confederations, who, though they may be at feud, agree on that day to declare a truce. B. THE HADHRAMAUT Aeea In its broader sense, this region may be said to extend inland from the coast of the Arabian Sea to about lat. 17° N. ; and from long. 47° E. to long. 53° E. Its frontiers are in no sense defined, but roughly it is bounded on the W. by the Aulaqi territory, N. by the great Ahqaf tract of desert, and E. by the Dhofar province of Oman. Thus considered, the region measures about 400 miles from E. to W. and has a depth N. and S. varying from about 220 miles in the west to about 50 miles in the east. In its more restricted sense, the term Hadhramaut refers to the broad valley running for some hundreds of miles more or less parallel to the coast, by which the waters of the many valleys in a large portion of the southern Arabian tableland probably drain into the sea, between Seihut and Qishn.218 THE HADHRAMAUT Physical Chabacteb Physically the Hadhramaut may be divided into four main hori zontal belts: (a)the lowland belt of littoral flats and foot-hills; a broad belt of downs or plateaux (jdl) diversified by a few out standing peaks ; (c) a belt of deep-cut wadis sloping north and north-eastward into a great main depression and a naked scarped ridge which skirts, and merges into, the great central sands. (a)The coastal belt varies in width, rarely, however, extending much more than ten miles inland, and is an arid waste of plain and low sand-hills with a gentle rise towards the southern spurs of the plateau belt. The coastline itself, which runs in a generally east-north-easterly direction, is fairly regular, but has a number of projecting points with small intervening bays without deep inden tations to form good natural harbours, and here and there longer stretches of unbroken line of low sand. The chief promontories are Has el-Asida, Ras el-Kelb, Ras Makalla, Ras Baghashwah, Ras Atab, Ras Sharwein, and Ras Fartak. (b)The plateau, which is calcareous in character and extremely arid, presents a more or less abrupt escarpment towards the sea and is, in fact, only a continuation of the great Yemen shelf or plateau and is penetrated in step-like stages by a number of rapidly ascending and burnt-up, arid, or sand-covered valleys. The crest line of the plateau lies generally some 30 miles from the coast and attains an average height of from 4,000-5,000 ft., the highest part being the Haj Bal Qabrein near the head of Wadi el-Aisar (or 'Aisar), one of the many tributaries of the main Wadi Hadhramaut. The surface of the plateau, which has a general slope towards the north and north-east, is comparatively uniform, with here and there a prominent peak. There are, however, very numerous shallow depressions where cultivation becomes possible, the water being supplied from artificial tanks that have been constructed to collect the surface water. (c) The deeply sunk wadis, by which the plateau is intersected, have a generally north or north-easterly trend, until they lead into the main wadi, which makes an immense easterly to south-easterly curve of over 500 miles before it debouches at the coast. The wadis in parts have almost the character of canyons, so abrupt and pre cipitous are their sides, and they look much as if they had been cut out of the plateau ' like slices out of a cakeThe descents into them are exceedingly sudden, but in the wadis themselves there is very little slope. Like those of the Yemen, they are in great part ex-PHYSICAL CHARACTER 219 tremely fertile, for though they have no visible perennial water courses, water is very abundant in the subsoil throughout the system and is procurable almost everywhere by sinking wells ; this is eminently the case in the main Hadhramaut wadi, or at least over a considerable part of its length, where vast reservoirs of water are available at little depths below the surface, at all times of the year, for the irrigation of comparatively large and continuous tracts of land. The last hundred miles or so of the main wadi are, however, desert, owing to the almost complete absorption of the water higher up for irrigation purposes ; the oasis tracts are thus removed from direct contact with the sea. The chief tributary wadis, naming them from west to east, are the 'Irmah, Rashah, 'Amd, Do'an, and 'Aisar, all of which join to form the Kesr ; the 'Ain, Bin 'Ali, and 'Adam, all eventually leading into the main Hadhramaut Wadi. (c) The scarped belt, skirting the main wadi to the north, and penetrated in parts by shorter tributary wadis, is calcareous and arid, and to a certain extent screens the main depression from the formidable desert tract beyond, which, however, makes encroach ments on this depression. Climate The district as a whole is hot except on the elevated plateau. The climate of the coastal tract is extremely hot and enervating (intolerably so in summer) owing largely to the aspect of the coast, which is almost due south, and to the elevated region by which it is backed ; the heat is especially oppressive when, as not infrequently happens, there are no sea-breezes. Bent describes the air of the tableland as ' fresh and invigorating after the excessive heat of the valleys below and he mentions Sujeila, at an altitude of 3,150 ft., as ' having excellent air that would make it a first-class sanatorium for Aden'. But this upland appears to be subject, at certain seasons, to a cold, penetrating wind, to cold and dewy nights, and to very great extremes of temperature. Twice during the year the coastal districts, at all events, of the Hadhramaut receive their share of the rains brought by the mon soons, though probably in a less degree than the Yemen. But the regularity of the rains in the interior is not so certain, for when the Bents visited the Wadi Sirr in 1894 they were told by the inhabitants that they had had no rain for two years, and that they were some times without any for as much as three years at a time. Thunder storms of a very sudden and violent nature are recorded by travellers, these being usually preceded by fierce heat and hot and violent220 THE HADHRAMAUT whirlwinds, from all sides, which disturb the dust. According to the Arabs, a particularly hot windless period of about forty days occurs with the changing of the monsoons. All travellers in the Hadhra- maut make frequent allusions to the intensely high temperatures experienced in the narrow confined wadis of the interior. Van den Berg says: ' Sicknesses are relatively few, which is quite natural, seeing the simple life led by the people, the pure and generally dry atmosphere of the mountains, and the total abstention of the people from pork, opium, and alcohol. Cholera is unknown, small-pox is never epidemic, but consumption is rampant, and there are cases of leprosy.' Population The total population of the Hadhramaut is extremely uncertain, and the various authorities give very divergent estimates. Mons, Babahir, whom Van den Berg cites as having had considerable facilities for judging, estimates it at about 150,000, which he dis tributes as follows : From Shibam to Shabwah, including Wadis Trmah, Dahr, andRashah ........ 20,000 Wadis 'Amd, Do'an, and 'Ain ..... 25,000 Shibam to Terim (inclusive) ...... 50,000 Terim to Seihut ........ 6,000 From N. of the main wadi to the desert .... 15,000 From S. of the main wadi to the sea .... 16,000 Shiheir, Makalla, and their environs .... 18,000 Total 150,000 Van den Berg, however, considers this estimate to be excessive, seeing that the greater part of the region is uninhabitable and unsuitable for agricultural pursuits of any kind. He himself gives the total of the chief centres of population of the interior, viz. Seyyun, Terim, Shibam, Ghurfah, and 'Ainat (or Tnat), as certainly not exceeding 29,500. The people are known as Hadhrami and belong generally to the South Arabian stock, claiming descent from Ya'rab ibn Qahtan. There is, however, a large number of ' Seyyids ', or descendants of the Prophet (described more fully below), and of ' townsmen' , of northern origin, besides a considerable class of African or of mixed descent. But in spite of these variations the HadhramiPOPULATION 221 form, geographically and socially, a remarkably homogeneous whole. T t may be said, in brief, that the districts of the Hadhra maut are singularly fertile and self-sufficing, and so situated geographically as to hang closely together and to be isolated socially, as a whole, from the rest of Arabia; while, at the same time, they lie within reach of ports which are in constant communication with mid-eastern Africa and India. To the north stretches unbroken the most terrible waste of sand-dunes in the peninsula ; to the east the district is practically isolated from the Oman provinces by the almost waterless desert of Mahrah ; while to the west it is difficult of access from the Yemen and its outlying provinces on account of a mountainous and sterile desert-steppe which, up to the present, remains almost entirely unexplored. Possessing more frequent and easy communication with Moslem communities outside Arabia than within it, the population of the Hadhramaut has had ample opportunity to develop particularism in its social organization as well as in its religious spirit. The fertility of its lands makes its farmers self-sufficient and jealous with the jealousy of men who have much to lose ; and, while their relations with Africa have given them unusual wealth of slaves, their relations with India and other parts of the East, greatly enhancing their material civilization, have at the same time made them fully aware of the nature of European rule and the danger of giving free entrance to members of a race which condemns slavery. For long they succeeded in barring the way to the en croachments of all foreigners, and it is only within comparatively recent times that travellers, few in number, have succeeded in acquiring information, and that only to a very limited extent, about the social organization, customs, and manners of this inter esting and highly exclusive people. The population may be divided into four more or less distinct classes : 1. The Seyyids. 2. The Tribesmen. 3. The Townsmen. 4. The Servile classes, or slaves. The Seyyids, descendants of Husein, grandson of Mohammed, form a numerous and highly respected aristocracy. They are divided into families, the heads of which are known as ' Munsibs who are looked upon as the religious leaders of the people and are in some cases venerated as saints. They do not bear arms, nor occupy themselves in trade or manual labour, or even agriculture;222 THE HADHRAMAUT though owning a large proportion of the land, they employ slaves or hired labourers to cultivate it. As compared with the other classes, they are well educated, are strict in their religious observ ances, and, owing to the respect due to their descent, they exercise a strong influence both in temporal and spiritual matters. The Tribesmen, as in Arabia generally, are the most interesting part of the Hadhramaut population and are the predominant class All the adults carry arms. Some of the tribes have settled towns; others lead a nomadic life, keeping, however, within their own recog nized territory. They are divided into families, each headed by a chief or Abu, while the head of the tribe is known as the Muqaddam, or tribal lord. Though the tribesmen are not his subjects, he is their leader in war or peace ; he can rule only with their support, and his authority depends largely on his personality. For the distribution, numbers, and influence of the principal tribes, see the section ' Government(p. 229 f.). The Townsmen are the free inhabitants of the towns and villages as distinguished from the Seyyids and the tribesmen ; they do not carry arms, but are the working members of the community, mer chants, citizens, cultivators, and servants, and are entirely depen dent on the tribes and chiefs under whose protection they live. It is to be noted that taxes fall almost exclusively on them. The Servile class contains a large African element, brought over formerly when the slave trade flourished on this coast. They follow the profession of their masters, i. e. the slaves of a member of a tribe carry arms or cultivate the fields ; those of a townsman follow the occupation of the master. As in all Mohammedan countries, they are generally well treated and often rise to positions of trust. A large number of Arabs from Hadhramaut go abroad, the Kathlri especially being enterprising travellers ; many of the Ka aiti take service in the irregular troops of Haidarabad, and emigration to the Dutch colonies in Java and Sumatra has also gone on since the beginning of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, a large number of Parsee and British-Indian traders have established themselves in the Hadhramaut ports, which carry on a considerable coasting trade with the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. D omestic L ife and A ppliances The houses in the Hadhramaut are often well ventilated and comparatively clean. A feature that first strikes the traveller is the form and character of the larger houses of well-to-do towns men. Often several storeys in height, they are mainly built ofDOMESTIC LIFE AND APPLIANCES 223 sun-dried brick on a foundation of one or two stories of hewn stone, clay being used instead of mortar. The upper storeys are usually whitewashed on the exterior, and this practice gives the towns a striking and bright appearance when seen from a distance. The house is usually approached through a courtyard surrounded by a wall six feet or so in height. The entrance door is often very solid and ornamented with carvings in arabesque, or with iron nails or polished brass, and it usually carries a knocker. The door leads into a pas sage, with cellars and storerooms to right and left, and conducts to a courtyard at the back around which are the kitchen and other domestic offices ; in the case of the larger houses, a private well is found here. The building narrows and the walls become thinner at each succeeding storey; there is usually a balcony to each floor, on the right and left, surrounded by a low wall of masonry, but rarely covered in as is usual in most Mohammedan countries. The living and sleeping rooms of the upper storeys all have many windows, unglazed, but invariably shuttered. Fireplaces are unknown; when the weather is cold, the rooms are heated by a brazier of burning wood around which the occupants sit ; wood which gives off as little smoke as possible is burnt, and what smoke there is escapes by the windows. All doors are closed from the inside by rough locks of wood or, very exceptionally, of iron. The main doorway is closed by a huge wooden latch which can be raised by a cord leading to the story above, thus obviating the necessity of going downstairs to open it. The houses of the lower classes differ but little from those of most parts of Arabia. The Bedouins shelter themselves in caves or huts of claytents are never used by them as in most other parts of Arabia owing to the violent storms and general uncertainty of the weather prevalent at some seasons. The so-called castles of the Hadhramaut are constructed in much the same fashion as the houses, only on a larger scale, some of them being of vast size and not infrequently covering an acre or more of ground. They have at the angles fortified towers (often furnished with antiquated mortars), either square or round, similar to those of mediaeval castles in Europe, and above the uppermost floor smaller square loopholed watch-towers or look-outs. There are often smaller isolated towers {hu little constructions of one or two floors, occupied by the guard. A raised terrace generally extends the whole length of the front of the building. All the houses, even those of the rich, are furnished most sparely and simply. It is usual to sit on the floor, which is covered with—————~ 224 THE HADHRAMAl/T I li 11 til II ■81 rugs or mats, or on cushions placed around or under the windows. A very low table, or a special circular mat, is put in the middle of tliejroom for meals. Rough but solidly made coffers and cupboards are much used for clothes, silver, books, or domestic utensils. Lighting is by lamps of a very primitive form, which burn petroleum or, more commonly, sesame oil. The walls carry little or nothing of ornament, though the tribesmen sometimes adorn them with their arms, banners, or hunting equipment. A bathroom is usually found on each floor of a house, all being situated one above the other, the waste water running off by pipes through the wall; the apparatus consisting merely of a vessel from which water is poured over the body, Wheaten or maize bread, dried dates, eggs, and meat (of sheep or poultry), taken in meagre amounts and usually in some form of soup or stew, form the staple foods ; rice is not largely eaten; the people on the coast consume much fish ; but only the Bedouin ever eat game. Butter, oil, and honey are much used; also spices, onions, and garlic, and much salad and green vegetables. Fruits, with the exception of the date, are considered as delicacies. Coffee is much drunk in the houses between meals, but there are no public cafes. It is customary for all persons paying visits to bring along with them some coffee-beans wrapped in the turban or plaid (rddi) ; when the party is complete these are collected by the host, and the coffee is prepared in the manner common to all the East. Before drinking, the name of Sheikh 'Ali ibn 'Omar esh- Shadhli, whose tomb is at Mocha, is invoked, he being reputed to have been the first to discover the stimulating properties of the berry. Vcry few servants are kept in most houses, even in those of the well-to-do ; the housework and cooking are done by the housewife and the daughters, with the aid, in case of stress, of help called in from other branches of the family, friends, or neighbours. Only the very rich have slaves, and these are treated more as members of the household than as property; for this reason slaves rarely desire to be freed. All slaves in the Hadhramaut are Moslems; even if they come from a Christian or pagan country, they are forced to embrace Islam. But marriage between free persons and slaves is extremely rare. Dancing is regarded in the Hadhramaut as permissible, but never among persons of two sexes, and the Seyyids and towns men usually abstain from it. The music is made by a primitive form of guitar (qanbus), a large oblong drum, and three or four small drums, the players often accompanying their music with i.DOMESTIC LIFE AND APPLIANCES 225 a monotonous chant. The dance is usually executed by two persons, each dancing by himself, who, while turning all the time, alternately approach and withdraw from the orchestra, but always keep at the same distance from each other; when the first two are exhausted their places are taken by two others, and so on for many hours at a stretch. The status of women in the Hadhramaut appears to be superior to that in many Mussulman countries. The wife lives in the same part of the house as her husband, but she receives her visitors in her own rooms. Divorce is very rare, the repudiation of a wife without very good cause being held in high contempt ; if an individual did so repudiate his wife he would certainly fail to obtain another wife of the same social scale. Polygamy is very uncommon ; there are no eunuchs ; in the event of the husband taking another wife, the first quits his roof immediately and returns to her parents. Amongst the Bedouins of the Hadhramaut polygamy is absolutely unknown. If a man definitively leaves his town to seek his fortune elsewhere, the wife may, and usually does, refuse to follow him. In this contingency it is considered legitimate for him to take another wife, and he is not expected to continue to support the first. The marriage dowry is of a double character; there is, first of all, a legal tariff varying from 20 to 2 J florins according to the social status of the fiancee ; and secondly, there is the nuptial gift, the amount of which varies according to her personal qualities: tne first may be reclaimed in the case of a dissolution of marriage, the latter not. In the Hadhramaut the poor and the rich dress much alike, the quality of the material, the jewels worn, and the arms carried being the only indications of status. The clothes worn by the townsmen resemble, in many respects, those of most orientals. Sandals with thin shoes, but no stockings, are worn ; when out of doors a kind of plaid (rddi), made locally, about seven yards long and a little short of a yard wide, is invariably carried or thrown over the shoulders. The head is shaven. The garments of the tribesmen are similar in the mam to those of the townsmen, except that they are shorter, are worn some what differently, and the material is usually woven in diamond check'; the jubbah, or robe, is replaced by a shorter buttoned jacket; and the tribesmen carry their arms, a straight sword, a two-edged poniard, &amp;c. The r is also worn. The hair is grown long and falls over the shoulders, and the head is covered ARABIA I -o226 THE HADHRAMAUT either with a plain piece of stuff worn turban-like, or with a fringed head-cloth (jibdl) falling over the shoulders. The Bedouins wear the same type of costume as the other members of their race, but of poorer material; they rarely wear sandals, and have their bodies bare above the waistband and below the knees. The garments of the women are very similar to those of the men, and, excepting in small particulars, resemble the dress in other dis tricts of Arabia. They ordinarily wear, not sandals, but boots of a yellow or red colour ; they dress their hair in short tresses to the number of from 50 to 60, and married women, in addition, have a fringe over the forehead. The better classes go veiled, but the lower classes cover the head with a form of kerchief which they can use as a veil to cover the forehead and mouth, if need be, Young girls do not cover the face. Industries and Agriculture Of great industries there are naturally none in the Hadhramaut. A small amount of weaving is carried on in the houses, especially at Terim, but the quantity is decreasing owing to the importation of stuffs from abroad. Formerly the cultivation and preparation of indigo for the dyeing of locally woven stuffs were carried on to a considerable extent, but that industry too has greatly declined except in the more remote districts of the interior. Boat-building, fishing, and the salting of fish are the occupations of many along the littoral. It has been remarked that the inhabitants of the Hadhra maut mountains become the most intrepid sailors ; not only the Arabs of Shiheir and Makalla, but also those of the mountain regions show an innate disposition for navigation, even those who may never have seen a boat before. For the most part the land in the settled centres is in the hands of the Seyyids or of other infiuential members of a tribe. The chief agricultural products are wheat, maize, millet, indigo, tobacco, sesame, dates, and coco-nuts, the latter grown only on the littoral. Cotton is cultivated here and there, but in insufficient quantities to supply the needs of the district; lucerne is much grown for fodder. A kind of tobacco, known as Humuni, is grown round Ghail Ba Wazir and has a great local reputation. There are planta tions of ithl (tamarisk) and 'elb, two kinds of wood suitable for making utensils and for building purposes. The seasons are deter mined by the stars. Irrigation is almost entirely artificial ; neitherINDUSTRIES AND AGRICULTURE 227 the rains nor the variable streams are in general adequate to this purpose, and watering of the soil is mainly carried on from wells. These may be sunk practically everywhere in the valleys. As in many other parts of Arabia, the water is drawn up in a leather hoist by animals, usually cows, attached to a cord which passes over a pulley supported on wooden struts ; the water thus obtained is received in a large wooden trough whence it is spread over the land by means of little runnels. Cattle-rearing is the principal occupation of the Bedouins. Camels and donkeys are reared for transport purposes ; sheep for ki lling and for milk ; cows only for milk and irrigation work ; oxen exclusively for ploughing. Horses are very rare and are con sidered as animals de luxe. Bees are numerous, and much honey is produced. The wild animals most largely found are the rabbit, gazelle, wild goat, jerboa, hyena, hedgehog, a large species of lizard (permitted as food to Mussulmans), and the panther, wolf, and monkey (not permitted as food). Trade and Commerce The only ports of importance commercially are Makalla (see p. 232), Shiheir (see p. 232), and Seihut (see p. 230), and even at these the trade carried on is purely coastal, with the near coast of Africa, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the southern coast of Arabia, and above all with Aden and Muscat. Trade by caravan is carried on from these ports with the whole of the interior of the Hadhramaut and with the southern Arabian littoral as far as Yemen on the west and Oman on the east. Burum (see p. 233) and Qusei'ir are small fishing villages. There are no made roads ; the routes follow the courses of the wadis or natural paths. Transport by wheeled vehicles is impossible everywhere ; all is carried on by camels or donkeys. It is, however, relatively cheap ; e. g. a camel from Shiheir or Makalla to Seyyun costs only 5 florins in the good season ; in summer, when forage is scarce, it is higher, but never above 10 florins. The chief exports are dates, stuffs dyed with indigo, a superior quality of wheat, and honey ; smaller exports are shells and fins of fish, the latter exported to India and China. Imports: wheat, butter, coco-nuts, coffee, sugar, rice, cotton and cotton stuffs, pottery, bars of iron and worked iron, sesame oil, petroleum, and tin-ware. P2228 THE HADHRAMAUT Currency The coins in use, according to Van den Berg, are : Copper. Rub' Khamsiyah = +0-005 florin. „ Khamsiyah = +0-02 „ Silver. Haraf = 8 Khamsiyah. „ Oqiyah = 2 Haraf. „ Qarsh =7J Oqiyah. Gold. None. There is also a coin, current in some districts, called Buqshah, worth % Khamsiyah ; and a copper coin, current only at Shiheir, the Diwani, worth | Khamsiyah. The five-franc piece, in place of the Qarsh, is popularly current all over the Hadhramaut, and the 10-cent pieces of the Dutch East Indies are largely in use. Money has a high purchasing power in the Hadhramaut, or, in other words, everything of native production is incredibly cheap; the only dear articles are horses and arms. There are no great fortunes in the Hadhramaut, with the exception of that of the Jemadar of Shiheir ; his resources may be placed at several millions of florins, invested mostly, however, in India. The Sultan of Seyyun possesses a fortune of some hundreds of thousands, mainly property in the country, and there are some few individuals with fortunes nearing 100,000 florins. Amongst the Bedouins money is rare. Weights and Measures The weights are as follows : Qaflah = + 2J grammes. Oqiyah = 10 Qaflah. . . Rotl = 12 Oqiyah (16 Oqiyah at Makalla and Shiheir). Raf'ah = 12 Rotl. Farasilah = 2 Raf'ah. Bahar = 12| Farasilah. Jabir = 2 Bahar. The measures of length are : Shibr = + 16 centimetres. Dhra' = 3 Shibr. Saqit = , 5 Dhra'. Farsakh = 80 Saqit.WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 229 Distances are reckoned by Khatwah (an hour's march, on the level, over ordinary ground, of about 3J miles) and by Marhalah (a day's march of from 8 to 9 hours). The measures of capacity are : Shatr = + j litre. Musra or Mudd = 2 Shatr. Raba'i = 1J Mudd (^Zw. Musra). Sa' = 4 Raba'i. Qahawil = 2 Sa'. The Qahawil is not in use at Makalla and Shiheir, where another measure, the Mikyal =8 Qurs or Musra (Mudd). Government The government of the Hadhramaut is in the hands of a number of tribal chiefs. The most powerful clan or tribe, at present, is the (estimated pop. 50,000), a branch of the Yafa' tribe, whose territory lies farther west. Originally invited by the Seyyids to protect the settled districts from the attacks of marauding tribes, they have established themselves as practically the rulers of the country, and now control the coast district with the ports of Shiheir and Makalla, as well as the towns Hajarein, Haurah, Qatan, and Shibam in the interior. The founder of this family accumulated great wealth and rose to the highest position in the service of the Nizam of Haidarabad, as 'Jemadar', or commander of an Arab levy composed of his tribesmen, numbers of whom still go to the East and elsewhere to seek their fortune. His descendant took the title of Sultan of the Ka'aiti in 1902. The Kathlri tribe was formerly the most powerful; they now occupy the greater part of the Central Hadhramaut, S e yyun, Terim, and Ghurfah being their chief strongholds. These two tribes are extremely hostile to each other. The paramount chiefs of both have been in political relations with the British Government, through the Resident at Aden, but the Kathlri have less intercourse with us than the Ka'aiti and, of late, have broken off relations. The Hadhramaut tribal chiefs nominally also recognize the supremacy of the Sublime Porte and profess to be .its proteges, but no part of the country has ever been really incorporated in the Ottoman Empire, nor has the Porte ever imposed taxes, sent troops or officials, or exercised any form of sovereignty. In so doing it would doubtless meet with the most obstinate resistance ; oil the other hand, the Turks have never sought the aid of the Hadhramaut chiefs, though the Imam of Yemen has made over tures to them latterly.230 THE HADHRAMAUT The other principal tribes, comparatively much less powerful than the two foregoing, are: the in Wadi Do'an; the Nahad, in the upper Central Hadhramaut; the in the southern side of the main wadi; the and Tamimi, in the lower Central Hadhramaut, east of the Jabiri; the and Mandhil, in the plateau region and the lower Hadhramaut; the Mahrah, east of the lower Hadhramaut; and the The Mahrah country, which is a coastal tract, links the Hadhramaut proper, on the west, with the Qara territory in the western confines of Oman. The pop. is estimated at about 50,000. Inland, the country is believed to consist of sandy steppes, but its boundaries are unknown. The Sultan of Mahrah, who is also ruler of Socotra, lives at Qishn, a rather poor fishing village about 36 miles west of Ras Fartak. Seihut, situated near the mouth of the main Hadhramaut valley, is a well-built town with many houses of stone, and is said to have a population of 10,000. Hafat is another thriving village on the coast from which 9,000 cwt. of frankincense is exported annually, principally to Bombay. The Wahidi, under one principal Sultan and several subordinate chiefs, occupy the south-western district of the Hadhramaut which stretches from the coast inland to the plateau. They are one of the least aggressive tribes in the country and have, for the most part, settled down into peaceful tillers of the soil or herdsmen. They control 50 miles of coast from Ras el-Kelb to Balhaf (a small Wahidi port), and carry on a little local sea-borne trade, having several good but small harbours, all, however, open to the monsoons. The total pop. is estimated at over 9,000 souls, including a few Jews. The chief towns are Habban, with some 250 houses and 2,500 in habitants, a mercantile settlement situated some 12 miles east ot Yeshbum ; Hautah, 2,000 inhabitants ; Raidah, with some 1,001) people; and Izzan (Hisan), a large village, with a pop. of about JOU. The combatant portion of the population of the Hadhramau is composed of bands of irregulars, and consists generally of t e members of the tribes and their families, who all know the use o arms. Some chiefs have in addition a special and more discipline guard and corps of armed slaves. Thus the Sultan of the Kaai i has an army, though somewhat irregular, of from 3,000 -4,000 meii and 1,500 slaves, which is mainly in garrison in the different town under his authority, including 1,000 maintained at Shiheir; e y are lodged and nourished at his expense and receive a little pay The Sultan of the Kathiri is supposed to be able to muster som 7,000 fighting-men and has also about 1,000 armed slaves. 1 e is no cavalry in the Hadhramaut.GOVERNMENT 231 Of governmental administration as a whole, in spite of the com parative homogeneity of the region, there is none, in the usually accepted sense of the term. The tribal lords have no care for what are considered in Europe the duties of government. Education, police, and public works are left entirely to private initiative, and as a result the two last are almost entirely non-existent. Instruction alone flourishes, and that only among the Seyyids and townsmen. There are some schools for so-called primary, secondary, and higher instruction ; in the two former the teaching is almost exclusively confined to language, grammar, and religion. The chief centre of higher instruction is at Seyyun, where the Academy, known by the name Bibat, is a sort of annexe to the Great Mosque; here there are about 100 students who receive free board and lodging and 300 outside students who pay fees of varying amounts. The teaching is confined to the intensive study of grammar, law, and theology, to the almost entire exclusion of the so-called modern sciences, astronomy (as interpreted by the Arabs) alone excepted. The study of medicine, among others, is entirely non-existent. As for Law and Magistracy, the influence of the Seyyids is a powerful curb on any oppression by the Muqaddams or tribal lords, and in the Hadhramaut there is a sufficiently independent magis- trature. The Seyyids have the greatest interest in seeing that the Mussulman law is honoured and respected, because the law and religion are one : the decadence of religion would inevitably bring about the loss of that superstitious respect which the people have for them as descendants of the Prophet. Each town or village of any importance has a with a sub-Qadhi for the country district round about. The Qadhis are nominated by the Muqaddams, but the latter consult the Seyyids and renowned savants before fixing on their choice ; sub-Qadhis are nominated by the Qadhis. The Qadhis have both civil and criminal jurisdiction, and base their decisions on the works of jurists of the Shafei rite. Judgements must be drawn up in writing and signed and sealed by the Qadhi who has delivered them, but can only be put into execution on authorization by the Muqaddam, who, however, uses his veto but rarely. The jurisdiction of the sub-Qadhis is limited to marriage and other acts of family life, the majority of the inhabitants of the country rarely having recourse to the judge in their other affairs. Differences between persons of the same family are in general adjusted by the Abu, and differences between persons belonging to different families by the Muqaddam. In the latter cases, failing accord, justice is settled^nppir 232 THE HADHRAMAUT by the law of the strongest; but if blood is spilt there generally arises a vendetta of long duration—there are examples of vendetta of from 20 to 30 years' duration for puerile reasons—and these sometimes involve and draw in whole tribes. The political conditions of the Hadhramaut are referred to under the section Aden (see p. 193). Towns The larger towns in the Hadhramaut are not disagreeable in appearance. In general they are open and spacious, and compara tively clean ; the streets are never paved, but, on account of the favourable climatic conditions and of the stony and porous nature of the soil, this is no serious drawback. Along the wider streets little streams of water (mija) frequently run. The principal towns have bastioned ramparts and gates, and these usually have a per manent guard and are shut at night ; many towns in addition are flanked by towers (/' fii ) or castles [hisn. plur. whose garrisons are composed of armed slaves under the command of the dominant tribe. Some towns, and notably Terim, have an extraordinary number of such exterior fortresses, distributed over a wide area, and occupying every commanding position available. {a)The principal towns of the Ka'aiti clan are the following: 1. Shiheir, once the chief commercial port between Aden and Muscat, is now largely superseded by Makalla. The town, which is triangular in form, extends for about one mile along the shore, and on an eminence there is a fortified castle, the residence of the Jemadar, head of the Ka'aiti, which is visible from seaward before any other object in the town. A high, bastioned wall surrounds Shiheir, and among the prominent buildings are the Custom House and a pictur esque mosque with white domes. The dwellings are much scattered and the population is about 6,000. The water is bad, but good supplies of sheep and vegetables may always be obtained. Bent describes Shiheir as ' a detestable place by the sea set in a wilderness of sand'. There is only an open roadstead, with no real harbour, good anchor age being obtained in seven or eight fathoms at about seven cables or upwards from the shore. The trade is mainly in dried fish; and the industries of the town are restricted principally to the manufacture of coarse cotton cloths and gunpowder. 2. Makalla, next to Aden the principal port on the southern coast of Arabia, is situated about 2J miles NW. of Has Makalla. It 18 built partly on a rocky point between two bays and partly in terracesTOWNS 233 (like a miniature Genoa) on a slope at the foot of a reddish limestone cliff, which rises to a height of about 300 feet immediately at the back of the town, and carries four conspicuous towers for the protection of the place. The town is guarded on the western side by a wall, which extends from the cliff to the shore and has only one entrance gate. The Governor's house is a large prominent square building; the other houses are chiefly huts intermingled with a few stone structures, but the houses on the point are of stone, and of a more modern and substantial character. In this quarter is the bazaar, which is well stocked with all the requirements of Arab life. There are two main mosques. The immediate neighbourhood of Makalla is particularly barren, but about one mile inland, to westward, is an oasis of gardens, belonging to the Governor, irrigated by a good stream of water. The water-supply of the town is obtained by means of an iron pipe from the source of this same stream. The climate is very trying, and the heat on shore is often excessive ; but land and sea breezes, with showers of rain occasionally, mitigate it from October to April and again in June and July. The population, which is a very mixed one, was estimated by Hirseh ' at about the same as that of Shiheir', viz. 6,000; but the Aden Military Report gives 12,000. Makalla is the only place between Aden and Muscat with any pretensions to a port. The harbour, having a fixed light elevated 25 feet at the extreme end of the promontory, is not available for anchorage during the south-west monsoons, and then a considerable portion of the trade is diverted to a place about 16 miles to south-westward, where good anchorage is found all the year round. A very considerable trade is carried on with India, the Somali Coast, the Red Sea, and Muscat. The exports are chiefly gums, hides, senna, and a small quantity of coffee ; the imports, cotton stuffs, metals, and crockery from Bombay, dates and dried fruits from Muscat, coffee from Aden, and sheep, aloes, and frankincense from African ports. Steam vessels call here, and steamers run to Aden ; but the coasting trade is carried on mainly by native saili n g craft of from 100 to 300 tons, the greater number arriving during: the date season. 3. Qatan, or Hautah, a very clean and prosperous Ka'aiti town, lies among extensive palm-groves and gardens at the head of the main Hadhramaut Wadi, properly so called. It is described by Hirsch as ' a collection of fortresses and castellated houses, among which the palace of the ruling head of the Ka'aiti tribe, with its battlemented towers, stands out most conspicuously'. From here the latter controls the numerous settlements of the Wadis234 THE HADHRAMAUT Do'an, 'Amd, and 'Adam, and the large towns of the main wadi. Speaking of this palace, Bent says, ' Like a fairy palace of the Arabian Nights, white as a wedding cake, and with as many battle ments and pinnacles, with its windows painted red, the colour being made from red sandstone, and its balustrades decorated with the inevitable chevron pattern, the castle of El-Qatan rears its battle- mented towers above the neighbonring brown houses and expanse of palm-groves ; and behind it rise the steep red rocks of the encircling mountains.' There are several mosques and a busy bazaar; the houses are built largely of stone. The town is surrounded by mud walls, which wind over the hill-side, beginning and ending at the palace of the Jemadar ; they are protected at the most elevated point by a strong fortress. The population of Qatan is probably well over 2,000. The water-supply is good and abundant, and is derived almost entirely from very numerous wells. A special kind of date called ' Hajar which is much prized, seems almost peculiar to this district. The Wadi Sirr is within easy reach of Qatan, in the recesses of which is Qabr Sdlih, the tomb of Salih, of no architectural pretensions, but looked upon as one of the principal sacred places of the Hadhramaut. 4. Shibam is built on an extensive knoll, in the midst of what is probably the largest agricultural settlement of the whole Hadhra maut system of wadis. The town is surrounded by a wall, about 20 feet in height, of sun-dried brick, with bastions and turrets at intervals; it occupies a very strong strategical position, being situated in the very middle of the wadi, so narrow here that the cliffs on either side are within gunshot of the citadel. On the side of the wadi, immediately opposite the citadel, is a fort with some cannon, and all the lower hills around are dotted with smaller fortresses. The town is entered by a high double main gate on the eastern side, and just inside is a large square, on one side of which stands the lofty palace of the Jemadar. Near by are other large houses of wealthy Seyyids or townsmen, many of them rivalling the palace in height and size, and whitened and adorned with domes and spires. It is to be remarked that many of these houses communicate by subterranean passages. Most of the streets are very narrow and steep, with occasional runnels of dirty water. In strong contrast to the quarter of the notables, some parts of the town are entirely in ruins : Hirsch says, ' in fact, all around speaks ruin ; houses falling to pieces ; miserable collections of huts an heaps of rubble Shibam, with a population of 6,000 souls (Van den Berg puts it much lower than this), is perhaps the larges oTOWNS 235 the interior Hadhramaut towns; and all the houses are gathered within the walls, since there is no security outside on account of the neighbourhood of the Kathiri. (6) The principal towns of the Kathiri are the following : 5. Seyyun, built on the slopes of Jebel Seyyun, at the edge of a very extensive and fertile area, which stretches away to the lower ground of the wadi and is dominated by the castle of the ruling Sultan. The town is surrounded by walls of mud, embracing, within the enceinte, a great number of gardens; it is entered by a low gateway. The streets are broader and cleaner than most of the Hadhramaut towns ; and the place has some pretensions to a drainage system, many of the houses having outlets for this purpose to walled pits. Seyyun is a town of many mosques, their number being reputed to exceed 300 ; the principal one, the Grand Mosque, stands on one side of the great square. The town is the intellectual centre of the Hadhramaut, the so-called Academy an annexe of the grand mosque, being the place of assemblage of a great number of reputed savants. The market is said to be the busiest in the whole country, and is held in the square on Fridays at the termination of noon-day prayers, merchants coming to it from all parts. Hirsch, however, states that, when he was there (1893), ' there seemed to be but little trade carried on, and there were only a few stalls in the market'. The population is estimated at about 4,500. The Seyyids of Seyyun are very powerful and wealthy, and many of them have large castle-like houses. The palace of the ruling head of the Kathiri stands on an elevated site, and is surrounded by its own wall fortified with bastions and outstanding watch-towers. The main block of the palace is surmounted by three very con spicuous look-outs, the middle one being higher than the other two. The chief is reputed to have two or three field-pieces and some old cannon in his possession. 6. Terim, some 19 miles NE. of Seyyun, is a considerable and straggling town built along a mountain slope above a broad belt of cultivation and palm-groves which stretches away towards the east. Its population, according to Hirsch (probably the only European who has succeeded in visiting it, but who, owing to the hos tility of the Seyyids, was obliged to return precipitately before he had very thoroughly explored it), was about 4,000 in 1893, and was declining. A low gate, with a large ruined fortress close by, gives entrance to the town on the Shibam side, and just within this is the main square, where the market is held: one side of the square is occupied by the principal mosque. It does not appear, however,236 THE HADHRAMAUT that the town is wholly surrounded by walls, but it certainly has a ring of numerous husun (castles) around it. A small pebbly stream, called the Kheilah (Hirsch, ' Chele '), runs through it. The town is divided into five quarters—Nuweidarah, Sahil, Hautah, Radheimah, and Khalif, some of them, according to Hirsch, being ' full of ruined houses The Sultan, at the time of Hirsch's visit, only wielded a nominal power, and was entirely in the hands of the Seyyids, who were the virtual rulers. The houses of some of the Seyyid. have a more commanding appearance than the palace of the Sultan, that of one being described as ' like a castle surrounded by an arcaded wall, and having a large forecourt towards the street, and very extensive gardensVan den Berg says, ' In ancient times Terim was the most important town of the Hadhramaut, not only on account of its size, but also in commerce, industry, and intellectual culture; in our days, however, it is surpassed by Seyyun in all respects. Many houses are in ruins, and whole streets have a deserted aspect, especially in the south-western quarter, and a great number of mosques have also fallen into ruin, and are no longer frequented. The decadence of the town dates back to about half a century ago, and was caused by the continual wars between the tribes (mainly the Ka'aiti and the Kathiri) in its environs.' In days gone by Terim was the centre of the weaving industry, which then was reputed to have been carried on in almost every house ; the town was also the centre of higher instruction, but in this respect also it now takes second place to Seyyun. For brief descriptions of the town of Seihut and of the villages Qishn and Hafat, all three on the Mahrah coast between Hadhramaut proper and Dhofar, see above, p. 230.CHAPTER VIII OMAN T he term: Oman is employed in a geographical sense for the projecting butt of the Arabian continent which is enclosed between the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and the Ruba' el-Khali, or Great Desert of Southern Arabia. In this, its broadest application, it would include the Trucial or Pirate Coast on the NW., which is treated in the following chapter under the Principalities of the Gulf Coast. The present chapter is concerned mainly with the Oman Sultanate, which claims suzerainty over nearly the whole of the remainder, including in the S. the entire maritime district of Dhofar. But there is also a small tract between the Sultanate and Trucial Oman, consisting of the districts of Jau and Mahadhah, which is not subject to any recognized ruler. These are here described under the heading ' Independent Oman ', and are followed by a short section on the Kuria Muria Islands, off the SE. coast, which now form a British possession. A. THE SULTANATE OE OMAN A rea If we include not only those regions under the Sultan's direct government, but also independent or semi-independent localities where his influence is normally stronger than that of any other recognized authority, his dominions may be regarded as extending along the Arabian coast from the entrance of the Persian Gulf to the village of Kharlfot in the W. extremity of Dhofar, and inland as far as the Great Desert. Northwards of the desert the land frontier on the side towards Bireimi, in the district of Jau, may be placed at the watershed between that place and the coast of the Gulf of Oman. A strip of coast-line, from Dibah to Khor Kalba on the E. side of the Oman promontory, belongs to the Sheikh of Sharjah and consequently forms part of Trucial Oman (see p, 333),'Ill i |||i 238 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN Physical Character The Sultanate is divided by natural features into several distinct tracts, or districts, which have recognized names. The dominant physical feature of the country is a range of mountains, begin ning at Has Musandam, the entrance of the Persian Gulf, and sweeping round in a curve parallel to the coast to Has el-Hadd, which divides the Gulf of Oman from the Indian Ocean. The mountainous point of the northern promontory, from Eas Musandam to Dibah, is known as Ras el-Jebel, or Ru'us el-Jibal. The remainder of the hill country is the Hajar of Oman ; immediately to the S. of Jebel Akhdhar, a group of lofty mountains to the SW. of Muscat, the range is cut across by the great Wadi Sema'il, which divides it into Western and Eastern Hajar. Between Western Hajar and the sea is a populous coastal plain, known as Batinah, across which a number of valleys descend, most of them thickly populated in their upper courses. Behind Western Hajar are the two inland districts of Dhahirah and Oman Proper, separated from each other by the lateral range of Jebel Kor, and both of them fronting the Great Desert. Inland of Eastern Hajar are the sandy districts of Shar(iiyah and Ja'lan, bordering the desert, and not separated from each other, nor from the more stony region of Oman Proper, by any prominent natural feature. The desolate coastal tract, from Ja'lan to Has Nus, has no general name; off it lie the island of Masirah and the Kuria Muria group. Beyond Ras Nus lies the district of Dhofar, consisting of a maritime plain embraced by the crescent of the Samhan hills. The two largest valleys are Wadi Sema'il and Wadi Halfein, which rise on opposite sides of the same pass and form the chief lines of communication between the coast and the interior. The Wadi Sema'il is densely populated, and, with the Batinah coast, is the principal seat of date cultivation; the Wadi Halfein carries the drainage of all the inland districts to the Indian Ocean and is the longest valley in Oman. The rocks are mainly of limestone, which in places is metamorphic, but around Muscat there is a remarkable outcrop of volcanic serpentine which extends for some ten miles along the coast. In the hilly districts and in Ja'alan springs and streams abound, many of them having a high temperature; but in the Batinah plain the water-supply is entirely from wells, which are also found in some parts of Oman Proper and Sharqiyah. The deep water off the Oman coasts renders navigation com paratively simple, but there are few harbours or safe anchorages.f !7t PHYSICAL CHARACTER 239 The best are in the Muscat district, and include the bays of Muscat and Matrah, and the inlets of Bandar Jissah and Bandar Kheiran ; but the first two are imperfectly sheltered, and the mountainous country behind the others cuts them off from communication with the interior. Climate The summer climate of Oman is intensely hot, and Muscat has the reputation of being one of the hottest towns in the world, but it can not be said to be unhealthy. During 1912 the highest temperature recorded was 114° Fahr. and the lowest 64° Fahr. ; in 1913 the highest temperature was 110° Fahr. and the lowest 69°. The high temperatures are due to the hot winds, which blow at certain times in the summer months, and generally only for a few hours at night, from the Arabian deserts and barren rocks round Muscat. For the greater part of the summer, owing to the high state of humidity in combination with a high temperature, the climate is very trying. From November to the middle of March the weather is distinctly pleasant, but fails to be bracing, as the temperature seldom falls below 60° Fahr. As at Muscat, the climate of the sea-coast generally, owing to its humidity, is relaxing and oppressive except in the coldest months. The Batinah is much cooler in summer, especially at night, than the rocky coastal tract to the east of it in which Muscat lies ; the months of May, June, and July are healthy there, but fever begins with the date harvest. Many of the towns and districts at some elevation on the coastal side of the Hajar watershed, while open to the sea-breeze, are shut oft by the range from the hot desert winds, and enjoy a fresh and temperate climate. In the interior the summer heat is oppressive, but in winter cold and wet weather is sometimes encountered. The ordinary rainfall in Oman varies between 3 and 6 inches, but occasionally violent storms accompanied by floods devastate the country ; on the 4th and 5th of June, 1890, during a cyclone, it rained continuously for twenty-four hours, during which 11J in. fell. The rainfall at Muscat averages 4 inches only, and it is due to this fact that the place may be considered a fairly healthy tropical port, provided ordinary precautions are taken to purify the drinking water by boiling or filtration, and to protect oneself irom mosquitoes, which are numerous in the town during the winter months and cause a considerable amount of malaria among the natives. In 1912 and 1913 there were no cases of cholera or240 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN plague; in the latter year small-pox occurred at Matrah, Sidab and to a less extent at Muscat, and there were six cases of black- water fever, of which two were fatal. Population The total population of the Sultanate has been estimated at about half a million, of whom at least thirty thousand are Bedouins. Arabs compose seven-eighths or more of the population, the rest consisting partly of aboriginal tribes, such as the Beni Na'ab, part of the Shihuh, the Zatut, and possibly some of the Bayasirah; partly of later immigrants, represented by Persian colonies (the relics of former invasions), Baluchis and Jadgals (originally intro duced as mercenary troops), Indian communities at Muscat and Matrah, and a large negro element, the outcome of several centuries of the slave trade. According to their own traditions the Arabs of Oman belong to two distinct stocks, the Qahtani or Yamani, who claim to be the earliest settlers, and the Adnani or Nizari, for the most part later immigrants, whose pedigree is regarded as less purely Arab. Each of th^se supposed racial groups is split up into a number of separate tribes, and these again into sections and subsections. The distribu tion of the principal tribes is noted under the sections dealing with the districts and towns (see pp. 248 ff.). But throughout the whole of Oman faction is strong, and political divisions are far more important than those of race. The two great political factions in Oman, the origin of which goes back to the civil war of the eighteenth century, are the Hina- wiyah and the Ghafiriyah ; and to one or other of them almost every tribe at the present day is attached. Generally speaking the Nizari tribes belong to the Ghafiri faction, while their Hinawi rivals are chiefly of Yamani descent ; but this is not invariably the case, and transfers of allegiance sometimes occur. Throughout the whole country the two factions are intermingled, usually in groups of villages belonging to one tribe or section, each maintaining a perpetual feud with neighbouring groups belonging to the rival faction ; often a single town or village is split politically, and feeling is intensified when one of the political parties is able, owing to the position of its ward or quarter, to control the water-supply. On the whole the Ghafiriyah predominate in the NW. districts, the Hinawlyah in the SE. The majority of the Hinawi tribes belong to the Ibadhi sect of Islam ; of the Ghafiri a considerable proportionPOPULATION nz 241 are orthodox Sunnis, but a few, such as the Beni Bu 'Ali and the Beni Easib, are Wahabite. Tribal organization in Oman is very loose. Some of the tribes are scattered and have no local centre ; others, though compact, are broken up into sections headed by sheikhs who acknowledge no common authority. In only a few cases is the tribe governed by a tamlmah, or chief, whose power extends over all its branches the office is nominally elective but in practice hereditary. Owing to the great increase in the arms traffic, which was only recently controlled and eventually suspended (see p. 247), far more of the tribesmen are now armed with modern rifles than was formerly the case. Products and Trade The greater part of the settled population lives by agriculture, of which date cultivation is the commonest form. Extensive date- groves are characteristic of the Batinah coast, the Wadi Sema'il, and the Sharqiyah district, and some very fine varieties are grown but the tree flourishes everywhere, even in almost inaccessible valleys and at a height of over 2,000 ft. above sea-level. Other fruit-trees which are more or less common are the plantain, mango, pomegranate, and quince, the sweet and bitter lime, the olive, and the almond ; the walnut, fig, vine, and mulberry flourish in Jebel Akhdhar, and the coco-nut palm grows in Dhofar. The common cereal crops are wheat, barley, maize, and millet; other crops are musk-melons, water-melons, lucerne, cotton, sugar-cane, and, in places, indigo and tobacco. The natural vegetation of the country is sparse and stunted, mimosa, acacia, and tamarisk being among the commoner trees ; grass is nowhere abundant. Cultivation, whether of fruit-trees or crops, is dependent on irrigation. In the hills and where streams exist water is brought by a carefully constructed channel, sometimes subterranean, and m that ease called a felej ; an open channel is called sdqlyah. Where irrigation is from wells, as in Batinah, water is raised to the irrigation- channel in leather hoists. On the sea-coast agriculture is supplemented, or replaced, by fishing. In Batinah, where the fisheries are important, the nets are sometimes a mile long and form the principal possession of the village ; at certain seasons the fishermen ply their trade along the coast of Mekran. On the coast live stock, including camels, are largely fed on fish-heads boiled up with date-stones, remnants of mats, and other refuse. Cattle, sheep, and goats are found ARABIA I q242 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN everywhere ; the sheep, which are less numerous than the goats, are most common in the hilly districts, and in the possession of the Bedouins. The cattle are of the humped Indian variety. Camels are bred and sold by the Bedouins, and are numerous in Sharqiyah and Batinah ; the dromedaries of Oman are esteemed among the best in Arabia. In both the Ha jar districts donkeys are largely employed, but very few horses are found anywhere. In normal times a considerable carrier-class is engaged in local trade and along the through routes from the coast to the interior. In some of the larger inland towns part of the population lives by retail trade or by simple industries and manufactures; such are indigo-dyeing, as at Nizwa and Tbri, copper and brass work at Nizwa, and the weaving of cloth turbans and lungis at other places. Muscat is famous for its gold and silver work, especially the sheaths and mountings of daggers and swords, the workmen being Indians (of. p. 257). In addition to Muscat and Matrah, the towns of Sur and Khaburah are ports of which sea-borne trade is the mainstay. The only valuable export is dates, of which the better sorts go to America, and most of the remainder to India. The date, a small dark-coloured sort grown mainly in the Sema'il valley, is popular in America. Exports of secondary importance are pearls, mother-of-pearl, dried limes, fresh fruit, and salt fish, which go chiefly to India. By far the most valuable import, received in return, is rice from India ; and next in importance are cotton goods, Indian, Manchester, and American, the first two classes imported through Bombay. Twist and yarn, silk and silk goods, sugar, coffee, and cereals (other than rice) form the chief remaining imports. With the exception of palm-trunks, all timber is brought from India and Africa. The foreign trade is largely in the hands of Indian merchants resident in Muscat and Matrah, but there are also some wealthy Arab merchants. The total value of imports at Muscat was £401,320 in 1911-12, £463,551 in 1912-13, and £407,768 in 1913-14. It should be noted that the imports for 1912-13 included an item of over £180,000 for arms and ammunition, imported mainly during the seven months from April to the end of October. By the latter date the warehouse regulations (see p. 247) had begun seriously to affect the traffic, and in 1913-14 the year's imports under the same head amounted only to £13,500. The total value of exports was £290,387 in 1911-12, £301,477 in 1912-13, and £271,536 in 1913 -14. Ine decrease in the last year referred to, as compared with 1912-13, was entirely due to less export of specie. Muscat's trade with tne interior has of course been entirely dislocated since the rising of tnePRODUCTS AND TRADE 243 tribesmen in 1913 (see p. 247), and their capture of the Sema'ii valley. The British India Company, which has the contract for mails from and to India, provides a weekly fast mail service, and also a weekly slow coasting service, between Bombay and Basra, and the vessels call at Muscat both ways. The vessels of the Arab Steamers, Ltd., maintain an irregular service between Bombay and Basra calling at Muscat; and during normal times vessels of the Bucknall Steamship Co., the Strick Line, and the West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co. from London, the Compagnie Russe de Navigation a Vapeur et de Commerce from Odessa, and the Ham- burg-Amerika Line from Hamburg, call at Muscat. Currency The currency of Oman is the Maria Theresa dollar or riyal, and the debased copper coin minted in 1895 to the order of the Sultan. The Indian rupee also circulates, and copper pice are imported from India, Zanzibar, and German East Africa, Sovereigns and British coins are also current in Muscat and Matrah, but in the interior these coins are exchanged at a discount. The rate of exchange between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varied in the year 1912 from Ulifo. 8a. (£9 4(1.) to 152ifo, (£10 2s. 8d.) per 100 dollars, the lowest being in April and the highest in October ; in 1913 it varied from 145i?s. (£9 14s.) to 154i?s. 8a. (£10 6s.). The instability of the silver exchange occasions many shipments of specie between Muscat and Bombay, and is unfavour able for trade. accounts are kept in m oh am culi s and cjaj —imaginary coins. There are two kinds of mohamadis, black and white ; the black is used for fruits, vegetables, &amp;c., the white in wholesale accounts : 1 dol. = 20f black m., or 11^ white Most hundis (bills of exchange) from India show their face value m mohamadis and not in rupees : 20 Gaj = 1 Mohamadi. 11^ Mohamadis = 1 dollar. 100 Mohamadis = 1 Toman. With regard to the use of hundis in foreign trade, Lorimer ter of the PersianOulf, 1908) writes : ' the usual means of payment is by Hundis, here called Kundis, or bills of exchange at twenty-one ays sight, drawn against requirements ; these instruments are practically accommodation bills, as possession is not given of the Q 2244 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN bills of lading for the cargo against which they are drawn, and there is no relation between the value of the Hundi and the value of the consignment.' He adds that the existence of such a trade usage is sufficient in itself to deter European firms from engaging in banking business in Muscat. Weights and Measures There are two kinds of weights, one for the Sultan's customs and the other for retail bazaar use. (1) Those used for the Sultan's customs are : 1 Kiyas = 6 dol., or oz. 1 Muscat maund (or Mann) = 24 Kiyas, or 144 dol., or 8 lb. 14^ oz. 10 Muscat maunds = 1 Farasilah. 200 Muscat maunds = 1 Bahr. There is yet another weight also called Bahr, which is equal to 400 Muscat maunds. This weight is exclusively used for weighing salt. (2) Bazaar weights are : 1 Kiyas = 5*71 dol., or S-GT oz. 1 Muscat maund (or Mann) = 24 Kiyas, or 137 dol., or 8 lb. 8 oz. With the exception of rice, which is sold in bags, all cereals are sold by palli and farrah (wooden bowls): 40 Pallis = 1 Earrah. 20 Earrahs = 1 Khandi. When measuring in palli the measure is heaped up. The Indian rupee is taken as 1 tola, and is used for weighing perfumeries. The weight of a Maria Theresa dollar is chiefly used in weighing amber: 6 Miskals (Mithqdls) = 1 rupee weight. 8 Miskals {Mithqdls) 1 dol. weight. Weights and measures vary somewhat from place to place. Those in use at Muscat (given above) are the same as those of Matrah, but differ somewhat from those of the Batinah coast and other parts ol Oman; Lorimer {Gazetteer of the 1908) notes that the Kiyas of the interior is only a quarter of the Muscat Kiyas, and that the same holds good of the Mann ; in the interior there is a weight called sd' (plur. sd 'df), equal to 7| Kiyas, and another called (plur. makd'il), equal to 12 Kiyas or half a Mann. The following is the ordinary table of measures of length at Musca with their equivalents :/ iL4 fti WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 245 1 Shibr = 1 palm or 4| in. 1 Thraah {Dhrd') = 1 ft. 6 in. 1 Baah (J5a') = 4 Thraahs or 6 ft. It should be noted that in all transactions the Dhra' is used ; this is the cubit, i. e. the distance from a man's elbow to the point of his middle finger. Elsewhere the Shibr is a longer measure, the span. Lorimer notes the use in Oman of the Fatr, or short span, the space between the thumb and forefinger when extended. Government The government is a Sultanate, or absolute monarchy, the present hereditary Sultanate having arisen out of an ancient elective Imamate. The reigning family of the A1 Bu Sa'id owes its elevation to Ahmed ibn Sa'id of the Azd tribe, formerly a trader and then Governor of Sohar under Seif ibn Sultan, the former Ya'rabi Imam of Muscat.' He mustered the inland tribesmen in 1741 and expelled the Persian allies of his predecessor from the country. The present Sultan is his lineal descendant in the fifth generation. The government is without system or efficiency, and outside the districts of Muscat and Batinah the Sultan's authority has always been precarious or merely nominal. Inland chiefs, and in particular the Sheikhs of Rostaq, have never acquiesced willingly in the claim of the Sultan of Muscat to exercise lordship over them, and they have more than once come near expelling him from his capital. At the best the Sultan has been represented at a number of points by executive officials styled Valis who have exercised their powers according to the means at their disposal; and at some less important places a few minor civil or military officials have been stationed, under the orders of the Vali nearest them. But their authority has never been adequately supported. The total strength of the Sultan's garrison being only 1,050 men, the detach ments have been so small and dispersed that they have always been powerless against aggressive action. The method of subsidizing tribal levies has been tried, but was found to be both expensive and ineffectual. » At the present moment the Sultan's authority is limited to his capital and the coast-line; the populations of both the interior and the west and north of Oman, in other words the great proportion of the inhabitants, do not acknowledge his sway, and live in practical independence of him under their own chiefs. They claim a religious sanction for this attitude. For the title of the Sultan is nowadays246 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN properly Seyyid, not Imam, the Ibadhi sectaries, who predominate in the population of Oman, according the latter title to their rulers not of right, but only if the latter are peculiarly qualified by religious learning. At the present time the principal Ibadhi Sheikh has put up an Imam in opposition to the Sultan. The rising proved serious, and disaster was only averted in 1915 by the intervention of our Indian troops (see p. 247). In fact, no Sultan for some generations has been able to establish or maintain his authority without our help. Apart from the annual subsidy from the Indian Government (see below), the revenue of the Sultanate is derived mainly from the sea-customs {'ushur), import duty being levied on all goods at the rate of 5 per cent. ad valorem, the maximum permitted by treaty. Subsidiary sources of income are the and The former term, technically applied, meansthe tax authorized by Moham medan law on agricultural and movable property; but here it denotes an export duty, permitted by the British Government to be taken at the rate of 5 per cent. a in lieu of the true The concession was made on account of the Sultan's inability to collect the Zakdt in the up-country districts. On the sea-board the Beit el-Mdl implies the rent of shops and other property owned by the State. Even in normal times the Sultan's maintenance of law and order, beyond the limits of the capital and Matrah, was merely nominal. The administration of criminal and civil justice, such as could be carried out locally by the Valis in his name, was on the whole in accordance with Mohammedan law. Elsewhere the only effective justice is such as may be enforced by local sheikhs in accordance with Arab custom. Recent History and Present Politics Our treaty relations with Muscat began as early as 1798, and foreign interests, whether political or commercial, are predominantly British. Great Britain is the only power represented by a Consul or Political Agent, though France and the United States are each repre sented by a Vice-Consul. Since 1891 the Sultan has been under a binding agreement with the Indian Government, and he receives a large annual subsidy, as well as a guarantee of protection, on condition of his observing it. The most important of its terms are that he shall alienate no part of his territory except to the ® ri ^, s ' that he shall direct his policy in conformity with ours, and a he shall accept no help, pecuniary or other, from any other toreig power.RECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 247 The reigning Sultan of Oman, Teinrnr ibn Feisal, the eldest son of his predecessor, succeeded on October 4, 1913, at the age of 27, and was recognized by the British and French Governments on November 15 of that year. He found his realm in a bad state. In 1895 his father, Feisal ibn Turki, had already experienced a formid able rising of the Hinawi tribesmen, when the rebels actually pene trated into Muscat, and drove him from his palace to take refuge in the eastern fort. At the time of his death he was faced by another serious rebellion with which his son has had to cope. His reign may be said to have marked the rise of the arms traffic, which during the last few years overshadowed all other questions at Muscat, and more than once imperilled the friendly relations between his State and the British Government. For not only did Muscat become a local centre of supply of arms and ammunition for Oman, but large consign ments were re-exported thence to the Persian coast and Afghanistan. A blockade of the Mekran coast, which was instituted by the British Government in 1909, paralysed for a time the export trade. Several large captures were made, and the practice of carrying small consignments was stopped by the burning of dhows which were proved to have carried them. More stringent measures became necessary in 1912, when, after a preliminary proclamation in June of that year, an Arms Warehouse was established at Muscat, through which all traffic in arms and ammunition, whether for import or export, must be conducted under direct Government control. From the date of the opening of the Warehouse on September 1, the port of Muscat rapidly ceased to be a distributing centre. To a certain extent its place was taken by a number of smaller depots, scattered chiefly among the Oman hills and along the Batinah coast; for sea going steamers continued to smuggle arms in amongst bales of merchandise at various ports of call. But, after making all allow ances, it would seem that, as a result of the Arms Warehouse, barely a tenth of the former infiltration of arms and ammunition reached the inhabitants. Moreover, in October 1913, the deportation of the notorious Baluchi arms trader 'Ali Musa Khan, and his banishment for five years, served to inspire all arms traders with a wholesome respect for the State Warehouse and its regulations. In May 1913 the rising of the Oman tribes, which had been threatening for a year past, began to assume serious proportions under the leadership of the so-called Imam of Tanuf, Salim ibn Rashid el-Kharusi. The rising was due to the preaching of the principal Ibadhi Sheikh, 'Abdullah ibn Humeid es-Salimi, who inflamed any feeling of discontent at the establishment of the Arms Warehouse, and proclaimed his son-in-law, Salim ibn-Rashid, as248 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN ' Imam of the MusliminThe rebellion spread rapidly, Nizwa falling about the middle of June, followed by Izki and 'Awabi in the course of the month. In July a body of Indian troops was landed and they occupied Beit el-Felej, a hamlet near Matrah '(seep. 258)' with a picket posted on Ruwi village (see p. 258). At the begin ning of August the forts of Bidbid and Sema'il passed into the hands of the rebels ; and, as a projected attack on Muscat was rumoured, the garrison at Beit el-Felej was doubled in Septem ber, But nothing came of the attack at that time, and the new Sultan, after his accession, entered into negotiations with theHinawi tribes and arranged a temporary truce. Throughout the year 1914 the Imam continued to give trouble in the interior, and made preparations for a renewed attack. A bom bardment of the ports of Barkah and Quryat in April of that year had a tranquillizing effect upon the coast; but, as a means of precaution, Indian reinforcements were sent to Muscat in November, By the end of the year the tribes had gathered, and in January 1915 the threatened attack took place, when a force of Arabs, estimated at 3,000, attacked the British outpost line but met with a crushing defeat. This success relieved the situation, though the rebel party still dominates the interior. Meanwhile, the Warehouse has worked well, and the importation of arms and ammunition has ceased. DISTRICTS I. Ras el-Jebel, or Ru'us el-Jibal A mountainous district forming the northern part of the great Oman Promontory, Its coast-line runs from Ras Sha'am in the Persian Gulf, round Ras- Musandam to Dibah Bay in the Gulf of Oman. Its southern boundary may be regarded as marked approximately by the route which runs from Dibah by Khatt to the town of Ras el-Kheimah on the Persian Gulf. Geographically the coastal tract of Shameilxyah forms part of Ru'us el-Jibal, but politically it belongs to the Sharjah Principality (see p. 340 f.). The whole area is a maze of barren mountains, which on the eastern side rise abruptly from the sea and form precipitous clifis, only broken here and there by small sandy bays where valleys reach the coast. The promontory is indented by numerous deep- water inlets, some of considerable extent. In them the winds are very baffling, and entering or leaving is difficult for a sailing vessel, though any of them can be entered by a vessel under steam._ Two of them, viz, Ghubbah Ghazirah, or Malcolm Inlet, and Khor esh-DISTRICTS 249 Sham, or Elphinstone Inlet, form fine natural harbours. Malcolm Inlet would shelter a large fleet, but is not suitable for a fixed coaling-station as it would not be easy to defend. Vessels could safely coal in it from colliers, and it would serve as a good temporary anchorage. Elphinstone Inlet has three islands in it, one of which is called Telegraph Islet; it formerly had on it a British telegraph station, the foundations of which still stand. The heat on this islet in summer is intolerable. There are date-groves in some of the valleys, especially near the sea; but the mountains are almost entirely bare except for some vegetation in the fissures of the rocks, affording a scanty pasturage for goats. The highest peak of the district is Jebel el-Harim (6,750 ft.) in the centre of the peninsula, fifteen miles south of Fhasab; the second highest peak is Jebel Qa'wah (5,800 ft.), eight miles NNW. of Dibah. The population are almost entirely of the Shihuh tribe, who are somewhat darker than the generality of Arabs and have probably absorbed some Persian elements. They belong to the Hinawi political faction, and are now fairly well armed with modern rifles. In general they speak the Shihhi dialect of Arabic, but an Iranian dialect is spoken at Kumzar in the extreme north of the peninsula. The Shihuh of the coast inhabit houses of stone and mud, and live on the fish they catch, on imported rice, and on their own dates, supplemented by others from Batinah. Their principal occupations are fishing, pearl-diving, date-culture where possible, and the herding of goats. The Shihuh of the interior cultivate grain, but they are in great measure Bedouin and they own large numbers of goats. They have no regular wells and obtain water from improved natural reservoirs in the rocks. The only other tribe is the Dhahu- riyin, who live in little settlements round Malcolm and Elphinstone Inlets. They are practically a part of the Shihuh tribe, though they will not admit it. The Sultan of Oman is represented by a Vali at Khasab, with a guard of fifteen askaris, but he intervenes little in the affairs of the district, which pays no revenue. The principal settlements are : 1. Khasab, a small town on the W. coast, lying on the S. side of the bay which forms the approach to Khor esh-Sham, or Elphin stone Inlet. It stands on a sandy beach nearly a mile long, and is surrounded by date-groves, which extend some distance up a wide valley behind the town. There is a fort in the centre of the date plantations, and two or three small towers near the sea. Good water is obtained in abundance from wells (30 to 60 ft. deep). Wood, cattle, and vegetables are obtainable, and there is a bazaar250 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN of ten shops in the town. The inhabitants depend on their own cultivation of dates and wheat, and on fishing. There are six sea-going boats. 2. Kumzar, a small town at the head of a cove on the N. face of the promontory, built at the mouth of a gorge. There is no land route, nor any cultivation ; the inhabitants are fishermen and possess five sea-going boats which trade salt-fish and shark-fins to Muscat and elsewhere. In the date season all but a few persons migrate to Khasab and Dibah. 3. Bei'ah, the southernmost village of the district, on the E. coast of the promontory. It lies one mile to the N. of Dibah, and is separated from it by a water-course up which the sea runs for two hundred yards. Behind the village the mountains rise at a distance of a mile and a half. The inhabitants live hy date cultivation and fishing, and carry dates and fish to Muscat and the Persian Gulf. II. B atinah This is the most important coastal district of the Sultanate, running for 150 miles along the Gulf of Oman, from the S. border of Shameiliyah, some 3 miles NNW. of Mureir, to Heil Al 'Umeir on the SE. Inland it extends to the foot-hills of Western Hajar, which run roughly parallel to the coast at a distance of from 10 to 20 miles. The district consists of a low-lying plain, the stony character of the hills inland giving place to clayey soil on the level, which becomes sandy towards the sea. The channels of the great valleys, which scar the seaward slope of Western Hajar, become broken and dispersed when they reach the plain, and some of them are given different names from those they bear in the hills. There are no springs in Batinah, but water is everywhere obtainable from wells, the average depth of which is from 15 to 20 ft.; all crops are irrigated from the wells, the water being raised by cattle. Batinah is celebrated for its magnificent date-belt, which fringes the sea-shore almost continuously and in some places extends for 7 miles inland. There is also a good deal of other cultivation near the coast, and fruit-trees are extensively grown. The date is the only article exported, but the import trade from Muscat is not in considerable, as the valleys of Western Hajar are supplied through the Batinah ports. The interior of the district, with the exception of a few isolated spots, is barren and uncultivated. It is said tha a large number of tribes, settled in the towns and villages, have Bedouin sections which wander with their flocks and herds over r inner and unproductive belt.r«~ ' ■' v y DISTRICTS 251 Practically the whole of the Batinah belongs to the Hinawi faction. The largest and the most important tribes are the Yal Sa'd and the Hawasinah ; the former are Ibadhis by religion, the latter partly Ibadhi and partly Sunni. The Yal Sa'd are particularly wealthy, owning hundreds of thousands of date-palms and a good deal of land under grain, besides boats for trade and fishing ; they are consequently unwarlike and are little respected among other Arabs. The following is a list of the other tribes which are represented in this populous district: 'Awamir, Daru', Dhahul, Futeisat, Ghafalah, Beni Haya, Hikman, Beni Jabir, Jannabah, Beni Ka'ab, Beni Kaheil, Maqabil, Matarish, Mazari', Mishaqisah, Nairn, Qawasim, Yal Abd es-Salam, Shawafi', Siyabiyin, Al 'Umeir, Beni 'Umr, Yahamidah, Beni Ali, Al Badar, Biduwat, Yal Breik, Daramikah, Dawakah, Fazara', Ghafeilat, Beni Ghaith, Ghawarib, Hadadabah, Aulad Hadid, Al Hamad, Beni Hammad, Beni Bu Hasan, Hinadis, Beni Hina, Huyud, Jabur, Yal Jarad, Beni KhaM, Yal Khamis, Beni Khammarah, Khazeimat, Ma'awal, Manawarah, Maqannah, Maraziq, Mashafirah, Muwalik, Nuwafil, Al Bu Qarein, Qateit, Radeinat, Al Bu Rasheid, Beni Rashid, Riya- yisah, Beni Sa'd, Salatinah, Suwalih, Yal Shabib, Shabul, Shamus, Shiyadi, Al Wahibah, Za'ab, Bayasirah, Baluchi, Fawaris, Jadgal, Khojah, and Persians or Ajam. The district is easily accessible by sea from Muscat, and the Sultan of Oman maintains representatives at nine of the coastal towns. The principal Vilayet is Sohar, which is divided into the sub-Vilayets of Saham, the town and district of Sohar, Liwa, and Shinas. The remaining towns at which Valis are maintained, beginning from the north, are Khaburah, Suweiq, Masna'aji, Barkah, and Sib. The following are the principal towns and villages :— 1. Sohar, the administrative centre of the whole western half of Batinah, and the port of supply for a number of wadis and in some degree for the Bireimi Oasis (see p. 281). The town contains about 800 houses, mostly of mud and stone, and is walled upon the land ward sides ; several hut-villages adjoining Sohar are also reckoned as quarters of the town ; total population 7,500. The greater part of the town of Sohar is in the hands of Persians and Baharinah, or Arab-speaking Shiahs, less than a quarter belonging to the Bayasirah, an industrious and wealthy Arab tribe of inferior social status divided in politics between the Ghafiri and Hinawi factions. One quarter on the NW., separated by a small creek from the town, is inhabited entirely by Baluchis, and is known as The date-belt is 3 miles deep at Sohar, and besides dates the principal252 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN exports, drawn from the surrounding districts, are dried limes cow-hides, and goat-skins. The town's principal customer is Muscat, where there is also a ready market for the silk turbans and lungis of local manufacture; cloth, flour, and rice are imported from the capital. The Sohar bazaar contains about 200 shops The Vali, with a force of about thirty men, resides within the town in the fort, a huge brick construction, square in ground-plan and four storeys in height. 2. Shinas, some 30 miles NNW. of Sohar, and the capital of the Shinas division of the Sohar Vilayet. There are some 400 houses in the town, and a bazaar of 7 shops; population about 2,000. The water-supply is from wells; and the inhabitants depend on their date plantations and on fishing. The fort is held on behalf of the Sultan of Oman by a garrison of ten men under an 'Aifid. 3. Liwa, a town about 3 miles inland from a point on the coast about 14| miles NW. of Sohar ; population about 3,500. It is the chief trade centre of the Liwa sub-Vilayet, and is the seat of a deputy-governor, under the Vali of Sohar, with a garrison of ten men. The town is divided into seven quarters, a considerable proportion of the houses being owned by Baluchis and Persians. The most numerous Arab section is the Beni Hina, Ibadhis by religion and belonging to the Hinawi political faction. 4. Saham, a coast town some 15 miles SE. of Sohar and a mile or two (half an hour) to the east of the mouth of Wadi 'Ahin; the dwellings are mostly huts, and the town is divided into six quarters; population about 3,800. It is the capital of the Saham sub division of the Sohar Vilayet, and after Sohar is the largest port of the district; the sub-governor has a garrison of ten men. The town owns 30 boats (badans) trading with Muscat, Shinas, and the Persian Gulf, in addition to numerous fishing-boats and smaller craft. The inhabitants are mainly Bayasirah, Baluchis, and Za'ab, the last-named a tribe of Trucial Oman, Hinawi in politics and Hanbali Sunnis by religion ; a few of the houses belong to the Shihuh. Date cultivation and fishin g are the principal industries. 5. Khaburah, a large coast town, some 19 miles SE. of Saham, at the mouth of the Wadi Hawasinah, which passes the east side of the bazaar ; the dwellings consist entirely of huts ; population 8,000. Three-quarters of the inhabitants are Hawasinah ; there is a Khojah settlement (see p. 258) of about 25 families. Khaburah is the port of the Wadi el-Hawasinah and in part of the Wadi 'Ahin. The Vali has a detachment of ten askaris. The revenue is only about $2,000 a year, collected as ; the whole is spent on local administration.\tzz) DISTRICTS 253 6. Suweiq, about 22 miles ESE. of Khaburah, is a compact town of some 600 huts, with a fort. It is one of the ports of the Wadi Beni Ghafir, and possesses 15 boats and badans) trading with Muscat and the Persian Gulf, and some fishing-boats ; the rest of the town is occupied with date cultivation and the keeping of live stock. The inhabitants are Suwalih, Baluchis, and Persians, and there are a few families of Khojahs. The Vali has a garrison of twenty-five men. 7. Masna'ah, a small town of about 300 houses, at the mouth of the Wadi Fara', or Wadi Rostaq, some 17 miles ESE. of Suweiq. It is the port of the Rostaq district and of the Wadi Beni Kharus, trading with Trucial Oman and Muscat. The fort is occupied by the Vali, with a garrison of 70 men, and about $4,000 are remitted annually to Muscat from the customs duties. A little less than a third of the population are Baluchis ; the most numerous Arab tribes represented in the town are the Yal Jarad and the Yal Sa'ad, the latter a numerous tribe of eastern Batinah (see above). There is an Arab bazaar of about 50 shops, and within the fort are 10 shops kept by Hindus ; there are also a few Khojah traders in the town. The date-groves extend 4 or 5 miles along the sea and 2 or 3 miles inland. The wadi separates the town from the adjoining village of Shirs. 8. Barkah, a scattered town on the E. side of the Wadi Ma'awal at its mouth, about 18 miles ESE. of Masna'ah and some 43 miles (crow-fly) W. by N. of Muscat. The town consists mostly of huts, scattered among date plantations, and extends along the shore for about 3 miles ; population 5,000. In the centre is a large and lofty fort, very conspicuous from the sea ; it is surrounded by a turreted wall within which are some substantial houses. There is a well-stocked bazaar where almost every article procurable at Muscat may be obtained. The date-groves, for which Barkah is celebrated, extend from Wadi Manumah, 6 miles E. of the town, to Wadi el-Qasim, some 10 miles to the W. of it. Fishing is also con ducted on a great scale, quantities of fish being salted and carried into the interior ; but the anchorage is an open roadstead, affording no protection from the prevailing winds. The Arab population, which consists in great part of Bedouins who have settled and acquired date plantations in addition to their cattle, sheep, and camels, is exceeded by the Baluchis and Jadgals (Arabic a tribe of Persian Mekran said originally to have come from Sind and Sunnis by religion. There are a few Kh5jah families, and some Hindu merchants, who enjoy British protection. In the date season the population is swelled by harvesters from Muscat, and254 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN sections of Bedouin tribes often sisit the town. The Vali remits to the Sultan $1 ,200 from the ZaMt, but the customs of the port are expended locally. The fort is garrisoned by 20 men commanded by an 'Aqld. 9. Sib, a very scattered coast town, some 18 miles E. of Barkah and about 25 miles (crow-fly) from Muscat; population about 2,000. It comprises several detached groups, or quarters, consisting al most entirely of mud huts. The one masonry house, about a mile from the shore, at the inner edge of the date-groves, is the residence of the Vali. The bazaar, consisting of about 50 Arab and Persian shops, in addition to a few kept by Hindu traders, is poorly stocked. The principal Arab tribe represented in the town is the 'Awamir, which is Nizari by descent but now Hinawi in politics; Baluchis and Jadgals form the next largest sections of the population. The date-groves and gardens are extensive, and fish is obtainable in fair quantities. The anchorage is seven or eight cables off shore, in five fathoms sand, and quite open to the prevailing winds. The customs duty on goods imported into Sib is payable at Muscat, but the Vali collects locally $1,000 as which he remits to the capital. His authority is supported by a detachment of 40 men commanded by an ''Aqld. III. The Muscat District The tract of country which surrounds the town of Muscat, and forms a part of Eastern Hajar, may be conveniently treated as a separate district, though it has no local name. Its limits may be regarded as the Wadi Sema'il on the W. and the Wadi Tayin on the S., the sea bounding it upon N. and E.; it thus has a length of about 50 miles from WNW. to ESE., and a maximum breadth of about half that distance. It consists of a network of small valleys, diverging in different directions from the slopes of Eastern Hajar to the coast. Most of its surface is barren and rugged, but in places the country opens out into more or less level tracts. The only plain of any extent in the district is known as Saih Hatat; it runs in a curve, about 30 miles in length, and includes the upper basins of the Wadis 'Adai, Maih, and Mijlas, and a small portion of the course of Wadi Sarein. Its north-western part is the more open, approaching 8 miles in breadth, but north -eastwards it is narrower and more broken up ; its inhabitants are mostly Bern Waheib, a tribe that is found in but few places outside this district. The next largest inhabited area is the Wadi Boshar, a tract of country within seven or eight miles of Matrah, on the NW. sideDISTRICTS 255 of a spur, which runs from the range of Eastern Hajar to the sea between the town of Muscat and Wadi Sema'il. In spite of its name it is no true valley, and the drainage of the plain finds its way to the sea by various outlets. It contains a string of villages, extending for about 14 miles from NE. to SW.; they are little more than hamlets of huts, each with its own date-grove. The Wadi Boshar is celebrated for its hot springs, the one most fre quented for medical baths being that at the village of The coast of the Muscat district is rugged and bold, the hills to the E. of Wadi 'Adai coming right down to the sea ; they are of limestone rock, except in the neighbourhood of the town of Muscat, where they are of volcanic origin. Five miles SE. of Muscat there is an anchorage, known as Bandar formed by a precipitous island which lies E. and W. across the entrance of a bay a mile in length and breadth ; the main entrance is to the E. of the island, 280 yards broad with a depth of seven fathoms. The harbour is sheltered except from the NE., and would afford anchorage in six to seven fathoms for a fair number of vessels ; the site is naturally adapted for fortification. On the mainland is a village of 60 houses with a date-grove at the mouth of a valley; the an chorage can be reached by a coast-track which runs from Muscat as far as Qantab. There is no town of importance in the district with the exception of the capital and its suburb Matrah, from which the land routes start. The most important of these is that which taps the Wadi Sema'il near Eanjah, the principal highway between the coast and the interior of Oman (see p. 259). The following is a description of Muscat and Matrah : 1. Muscat, the capital of the Oman Sultanate and the residence of the Sultan. Inland the town is cut oft from the interior by rugged and almost inaccessible hills, formed by an outcrop of igneous rock which extends for 10 miles along the coast to a depth inland of 3 miles. The greater part of this volcanic basin is drained by the Wadi el-Kebir, and the town of Muscat is built at the point where the valley reaches the sea ; it lies on the Bay of Muscat, the eastern most of five large contiguous coves or indentations. The bay is three-quarters of a mile deep and half a mile wide, and is open to the NNW. Its W. side is formed by a rocky pro montory (435 feet high) terminating seawards in Has Kalbuh ; on its E. side is Muscat Island (1,300 yds. long and 350 ft. high), ending seawards in Ras Muscat. Between Muscat Island and the mainland is a rocky islet (100 ft. high), with a narrow and shallow channel on each side of it. On the W. side of the bay a small sheltered cove,256 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN called MaJcallah, is formed by a spur which projects about 200 yards into the harbour. The anchorage for large vessels is off the western shore near Sira el-Gharbi point, a spur to the SE. of Has Kalbuh; native vessels anchor closer in. Behind the town the hills rise to heights of 300 and 400 feet, and are dominated by Jebel Bardah (1,350 ft.), about 3 miles to the S. A route to the interior, by the Wadi el-Kebir, can be traversed only by foot-passengers. A track, practicable for animals, leads westward over a pass to Riyam and Matrah, and there is a similar pass on the SE. to Sidab. Both passes lie beyond the outer suburbs, and each is barred by a wall pierced with a gateway. Muscat consists of a walled town, built along a sandy beach at the head of the cove, and an extensive collection of unwalled suburbs. The town, fronting the harbour, is about half a mile in length from E. to W., and extends a quarter of a mile inland. On the E. side the hills are precipitous and no wall is necessary; the wall is built on the S. and W., and has towers at intervals. The main gate is on the W. side, the Bab el-Kebir, through which runs the road to the majority of the suburbs and to Matrah. The Bab es-Saghir, on the road to Sidab, is on the S. side. Both are fortified gateways at which guards are stationed day and night. A third gate, of less importance, spans the Wadi el-Kebir at the NW. corner of the town. The town's water-supply, situated about half a mile up Wadi el-Kebir, is also protected by a high square fort, built by the Portuguese, and there are a number of small block-houses in the hills surrounding the suburbs. The principal defences on the sea side are two forts, also of Portuguese construction, one on each side of the sandy beach in front of the town ; they are built on cliffs about 150 ft. above sea-level, and are approached by staircases cut in the rock. These and two other subsidiary forts on the E. and W. sides of the harbour are now of no military value. Many of the houses in the town are handsome structures of two or more storeys, built of stone, concrete, or mud, and plastered with gypsum stucco. The suburbs consist mostly of mat-huts, but some of them contain a few fairly good houses. The old mosques of the town are without either domes or minarets, but one of more imposing ; appearance has recently been erected at the E. end ot the town. The British Consulate, a large house with a flagstatt, lies also at the E. end, fronting the sea; and the hospital, in charge of an officer of the Indian Medical Service, lies to the W. o the Consulate. The largest building on the sea-front is the Sultan s palace.DISTRICTS 267 In number the population of Muscat fluctuates, and is lowest in the hot weather, when more than half the inhabitants of the suburbs seek a less trying climate in Sib, Barkah, and other places in Batinah In winter, when the town is full, its total population may be set at 10,000, of whom some 3,000 reside within the walls. The popula tion is a medley of races, and includes very few pure Arabs. Numeri cally Baluchis appear to form its strongest element, serving as soldiers, sailors, porters, and servants, and engaging in trade in a small way ; the next most numerous classes are probably the negroes and half-caste Arabs called There is a consider able Persian community, whose members are shopkeepers, fish mongers, and makers of quilts and bedding. The Hindu com munity is smaller, and includes bankers, importers of Indian goods, date-exporters, and silversmiths ; the Hindus also own some of the best gardens in the suburbs. The commercial community also includes a few Portuguese, Khojahs, and Jews. There are some Abyssinians, Nubians, and Hadhrami, the last named holding posts in the Sultan's service ; and a few fishermen from Socotra come each year to the Makallah Cove at the beginning of the hot weather and stay for a month or two. The language of the town is Arabic, but many persons speak Persian, Baluchi, and Hindus tani, and business communications can be sent in English. When the weather permits, excellent fish are caught in abundance every morning outside the entrance to the harbour, and there are some small market gardens and a few date-trees in Wadi el-Kebir ; but in other respects the town has no natural resources, and all food and fuel are imported. Muscat is the only port of Oman where steamers call regularly ; for the steamship services, see p. 243. For the commerce andshipping of the town, see p. 242; for its weights, measures, and currency, see pp. 243 f¥.; and for its system of administration and recent history, see pp. 245 ff. A British Political Agent and Consul are stationed at Muscat; and there are also American and French Vice-consuls. Post and Telegraph Offices have been established by the Indian Government. The town is connected by telegraph cable with Jashk, and thus with all parts of the world. 2. Matrah, about two miles to the W. of Muscat, is larger than the capital; it is in fact the largest town in the Sultanate of Oman ; total population 14,000, of whom about 9,000 reside within the walls. It is also the most important town commercially ; for, since Muscat has no land communications, all goods for the interior, after being imported at Muscat, must be reshipped to some other distributing centre, and this is generally Matrah. Like the capital ARABIA I -d258 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN it is enclosed by rugged hills on the landward side, but its isolation is less complete ; in addition to the coast road to Batinah, an easy route leads over a pass to Beit el-Felej and Ruwi, whence routes branch to various parts of the interior. Communication with Muscat is maintained chiefly by boat, the passage by rowing-boat occupying about three-quarters of an hour. Most of the merchants of Muscat reside here. The town is built on a beach of Matrah Bay, which is less remark able in appearance than the Bay of Muscat, and is more easily entered. Though open to the NE., it is sheltered from the NW., and is preferred as a harbour by native craft. The town extends along the water's edge for f mile, and has an average depth inland of 250 yards. It is protected on the landward side by a wall with fortified gateways, the principal gate being the Bab el-Kebir at the SW. corner of the town, by which the road leaves to Ruwi. As around Muscat, several block-houses command the approaches to the town through the hills. On the seaward side Matrah is defended by a fort on a rocky eminence at the E. end of the town; it is a Portuguese construction of the same type and value as the forts of Muscat. Within the walls the town is divided into eleven quarters, the houses being meaner than those of the capital; there are six quarters outside the walls. The population is as hetero geneous as that of Muscat ; but whereas at Muscat there are many Hindus and but few Khojahs, here the Hindus are few and the Khdjahs number over a thousand. In fact, Matrah forms the head-quarters of the Khojah sect in the Persian Gulf. They live in a fortified quarter in the centre of the town upon the sea-front, known as the Khdjah Eort, which gives them security from attack by the Arabs and privacy for their women ; the only non -Khojahs admitted to the enclosure are the British officials of Muscat, whom they regard as their natural protectors. At least half the population of Matrah are Baluchis, the predominant Arab tribes being of the Beni Hasan, Siyabiyin, Rahbiyin, and the tfem Jabir. &lt; , , The bulk of the up-country trade of Oman is concentrated a Matrah, which is the loading and unloading place of caravans tor the interior ; the import and export trade is mostly in the han s of the Khojahs and Hindus. The town is governed by a vai on behalf of the Sultan, and has a garrison of 100 askans. block-houses at each of the neighbouring villages of Arbaq an Mateirah, a guard of 50 askaris is stationed at night lor the pr tection of the town.DISTRICTS 259 IV. Eastern Hajar A tract of mountainous country of limestone formation, occupy ing the north-eastern fringe of the Oman peninsula, and extending for about 120 miles from Wadi Sema'il and its tributaries on the NW. to the Jebel Khamis range on the SE. Its watershed, which is continuous with that of Western Hajar, is about 50 miles from the sea at the head of Wadi Sema'il; beyond Muscat town its dis tance from the coast diminishes until, in the neighbourhood of Sur, the watershed approaches within 20 miles of the sea. There is no continuous coastal plain, such as separates Western Hajar from the coast; and between Daghmar and Sur the foot-hills of Eastern Hajar fall directly into the sea. Over the greater part of the district the hills maintain a com paratively high elevation, reaching 5,250 ft. at the head of Wadi Tayin, and 6,300 ft. inland of Quryat ; but SE. of Jebel Khadhar, in the Jebel Khamis range beyond Sur, they fall away to 2,845 ft. The disposition of the valleys and ridges with reference to the axis of the main range is still imperfectly ascertained ; but their arrangement appears to be less regular than that of Western Hajar (see p. 263): Wadi Tayin, for example, in its upper course runs parallel to the general direction of the range instead of at right angles to it. The inward slopes of Eastern Hajar are practically unknown, but they appear to be less abrupt than the outward face. The most important district of Eastern Hajar is the Wadi Sema'il, which forms its north-western boundary, dividing the Hajar range into an eastern and a western mass. It is the most populous and politically the most important valley in the Sultanate of Oman, and is described in detail in Route No. 71 (vol. ii, pp. 319 ff.) ; its principal settlement is Sema'il, the seat of a Vali, who represents the Sultan's authority in the valley. The other important settlements of Eastern Hajar are all on the coast; they are described in the following sections, in order from NW. to SE., following the description of Sema'il: 1. Sema'il, an important settlement and oasis in Wadi Sema'il. It is not a single compact town, but a group of twelve adjoining unwalled villages, with their plantations, fields, watch-towers, and homesteads ; these form a luxuriant settlement extending along the valley for 10 miles, with an average breadth of 1 mile. Its centre, Hisn Sema'il, divides the upper portion of the Sema'il settlement {'Aldyah), tenanted by Hinawi tribes, from the lower valley {Sifdlah) which is held by Ghafiris. The two halves of the B2260 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN settlement are constantly at feud, and when the stream is low the Hinawis sometimes cut off the water from the lower town. The castle of Hisn Sema'il stands on an isolated rockj eminence, scarped all round at the base, and presenting a high precipitous cliff on the side towards the valley ; it commands the great highway along the valley between the coast and the interior. On the east or lower side is a massive gateway containing two unfailing wells cut through the solid rock. The keep, a large circular tower of solid stone masonry, is built on the highest point of the rock, and contains a capacious reservoir which is always kept filled. Curtain walls, connecting the keep and the gateway, enclose a considerable area of irregular shape. The Vali resides at Hisn Sema'il, and his authority is supported by a detachment of 25 askaris, under an Immediately under the castle on the W. side are some 30 or 40 houses and about 60 shops, known as here the usual food-supplies, fruit, vegetables, meat, and salt fish, can he obtained. The settlement is rich in fard dates, and a large quantity are boxed and shipped annually to New York and Boston markets. Fruits grow here in great abundance and variety, Muscat and other markets being largely supplied from Sema'il. The only local manufacture is cloth-weaving ; cotton, both white and brown varieties, is extensively grown in the valley. About $2,400 are col lected annually as revenue, and of this a balance of $1,000 usually reaches the Muscat treasury. The Sultan's private property in land and date plantations, of an annual value of $2,000, are assigned for the Vali's maintenance. 2. Quryat, a town on the coast of Eastern Hajar, 31 miles SE. of Muscat, standing on the S. side of a creek formed by Wadi Mijlas. It consists of 12 hamlets, of which 3 stand on the sea shore and the remainder on a plain, about 2 miles wide, extending between the coast and the hills ; total population about 3,500. There is a good bazaar, the town being the port of supply for the interior via Wadi Tayin ; the inhabitants own a dozen large badans by which communication with Muscat is maintained. The date plantations are considerable, and barley and musk and water melons are cultivated ; there is also a fishing industry, and lime and firewood are exported to Muscat. The Sultan of Oman mam tains a Vali, with a military detachment of 15 men who occup, the fort in the Suq quarter. The customs of the port bring m a revenue of $3,000, and Zakdt yields $1,700 a year ; but ^. the exception of $1,000 annually remitted to Muscat, the who e - devoted to local expenses.DISTRICTS 261 3. Daghmar, a group of hut-villages on the coast, about 4 miles SE. of Quryat, in a plain, bounded inland by steep and rugged hills of limestone; the centre of the plain is crossed by a chain of low, stony knolls, on one of which is a small ruined tower. The drainage of Wadi Tayin reaches the sea here by several channels, passing between and round the villages. The group of villages extends for about 4 miles from NW. to SE. Water is good and plentiful, from wells 15 to 20 ft. deep; dates, fruits, lucerne, and cotton are cultivated; vegetables, fish, and live-stock are also obtainable. 4. Tiwi, or Teiwi, a large village on the coast at the mouth of the Wadi Tiwi, the chief port of the Beni Jabir country. It consists of three separate quarters, Ramlah,Quff, and all upon the coast, the wadi entering the sea between Quff and Jareif. Ramlah and QufE are both walled and contain mud houses and a few shops ; Jareif is a fishing-hamlet. There are many weavers in QufE, the rest of the inhabitants of Tiwi being cultivators and fishermen. Some 400 yards from the sea is a lagoon of fresh water, and date- groves and fruit-trees grow in the gorge of Wadi Tiwi behind the village. 5. Kelhat, or Qalhat, an unwalled fishing-village on the coast, 12 miles NW. of Sur, consisting of about 125 mud houses and a small bazaar of a dozen shops ; there are a few wells, but no dates nor cultivation. The hills of Eastern Ha jar rise behind the village at a distance of less than a mile, and the Wadi Hilam reaches the sea on its E. side; the inhabitants possess 12 which trade with Muscat and Sur. 6. Sur, a town of great political and commercial importance, on the coast, some 94 miles SE. of Muscat, and 17 miles W. of Ras el-Hadd. It is the second largest town of the Oman Sultanate, being only exceeded in size by Matrah (see p. 257); total population about12,000. It is built on both sides of a creek at its entrance, which is 150 yards wide, and, after running S. for half a mile, gives access to an interior basin about 2 miles in extent from E. to W. At low water there is only three-quarters of a fathom in the creek, and the basin is practically dry ; consequently Sur can only serve as a port for vessels of small draught. Behind the town and basin, at a distance of about 2 miles from the sea, a stony ridge runs from SE. to NW., and rises into shingly flats about 50 ft. high ; and behind the ridge and parallel to it is a plain which contains the lower course of Wadi Fuleij (or Falaij). The town consists of two large quarters separated by the entrance of the creek. That on the E. side is 'Aiqa, consisting of about262 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN 300 houses of the Beni Bu 'Ali tribe. Opposite is Muqmmatein a large quarter of 1,500 houses inhabited by Jannabah, who are perpetually at feud with the Beni Bu 'Ali of 'Aiqa. The houses in both quarters are mostly mud and stone, with stuccoed roofs, but some are merely huts ; the best houses and the largest number of huts are in Muqreimatein. There are no date-groves in the neighbourhood of these two quarters, which together compose the town of Sur and have an aggregate population of about 9,000. A mile and a half to the W. of Muqreimatein and half a mile from the sea is a village of some 200 houses, with another village, half its size, on the coast to the N. of it ; both these may be regarded as component parts of Sur. On the plain at the back of the ridge, between it and the bed of Wadi Fuleij, is a stone- built village of some 250 houses divided into seven quarters, with extensive date-groves and lucerne cultivation; it supplies the town of Sur with vegetables and fodder, and part of it is known as Suq Sur. A mile to the NW. of Bilad es-Sur is Jinah, a small village of about 40 houses, mostly huts, with an old fort. The inhabitants of Muqreimatein obtain their drinking-water from Bilad es-Sur, from Jinah, from S a walled enclosure with date-palms at the head of the Sur creek, and from a spot on the E. side of the creek to the S. of 'Aiqa ; the inhabitants of 'Aiqa depend chiefly on Shamih. Sur is the port of the whole district of Ja'lan and nearly all Sharqiyah; the celebrated dates of Badiyah are shipped here. Imports consist of rice, piece-goods, wheat and other grains, coffee, kerosene and other oils from Bombay and various Indian ports, ghi from Dhofar, and tortoise-shell, shark-fins, and dried fish, for re-export, from Masirah. From Sur and Hadd together the Sultan of Oman does not secure more than $6,000 a year as customs and |2,000 as Zakdt, the whole of which is absorbed by the local administration. It has been estimated that, if his authority were more firmly established, the customs of Sur alone would yield a sum of $50,000 a year. The Vali of Sur maintains no garrison either in Muqreimatein or in 'Aiqa ; but a total force of about 135 men is, in normal times, stationed in a number of forts and smaller posts in the neighbourhood, partly for the protection of the town and partly to control it by commanding its water-supply. The most important garrisons are two stationed at Bilad es-Sur, consisting of 40 and 15 men respectively, and one at Saneisalah of 30 men. There is a garrison of 15 men at Burj built in 1902 between the ridge and Bilad es-Sur ; and posts of 10 men are stationed atDISTRICTS 263 'Is 2 miles SW. of Sur, where the road to Bilad es-Sur and the interior passes through a gorge in the ridge; at Sakeikarah, at the head of the Sur creek; and at Shamih. At the village of Jmah there is a small post of 5 ipen. 7. Hadd, a village 16 miles E. by S. of Sur, in a sandy plain at the head of Khor el-Hajar, about 1 mile inland in a SW. direction from Ras el-Hadd. It consists of about 200 dwellings, mostly huts. The water-supply is fairly good, but not abundant. The inhabitants are of the Muwalikh tribe, and live mainly by fishing, cod and other rock-fish being here of very large size. Hadd is treated as sub ordinate to Sur for purposes of revenue and taxation ; and a detachment of 15 men is stationed here under the Vali of Sur's orders. V. Western Ha jab The district of Western Hajar extends from Wadi el-Qor on the NW. to Wadi Sema'il on the SE., having a length of about 160 miles. The watershed of the range is roughly parallel to the coast, and runs at an average distance of 40 miles inland. On the seaward side its boundary is the line along which its foot-hills sink into the Batinah plain (see p. 250), at a distance, on an average, of some 15 miles from the sea. The decline on the landward side is more gradual and the boundary with Dhahirah is somewhat indefinite. The valleys on this side up to their heads are generally reckoned in the latter district; but if the westward slopes of the range be included, down to the neighbourhood of Dhank and I'^'i (see pp. 268 and 270), Western Hajar would have an average breadth of some 40 or 50 miles. The main axis of the range runs NW. and SE., and the valleys on its slopes spread out at right angles on both sides. It is of limestone formation, and its north-eastern portion has generally a sharp ridge with many peaks. Its lowest point, at the head ot the Wadi el-Jizi, is about 1,860 ft., and it rises to ite highest in a considerable block at the SE. end, known as Jebel Akhuiiar, which has an elevation of nearly 10,000 ft. This mountainous mass throws ofi from its eastern end a great spur which runs tor nearly 30 miles to the NE. and forms the NW. boundary of Wadi Sema'il (see p. 259). The top of Jebel Akhdhar is described as a table-land which is highest, throughout its length, on the side next the sea. The chief peak is or Wis ham, (9,940 ft.), nearer to the W. than to the E. end of the mass. Another important peak is Jebel Khadhar (7,500 ft.), at the SE. corner, t264 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN and one of the -highest points on the NE. spur is NaUl (7,000 ft.). There are no large towns in Western Hajar, and the small towns and villages, with one or two minor exceptions, are on the seaward side of the range. The principal ones are described in the following paragraphs^ approximately in their order from SE. to NW.: 1. Shareijah, the principal village of Jebel Akhdhar, built on terraces on the face of a cliff at the head of Wadi Mi'aidin ] elevation 6,300 ft. The village looks down the valley, and the houses, about 200 in number, are solidly built of stone, though small and mean in appearance ; they seem to overhang one another, the different rows being connected only by flights of irregular steps. Just below the village is a copious spring with circular reservoir. Cultivation is carried out upon ledges, 10 or 12 ft. wide, for about 1,000 ft. down the hill-side, and includes apricots, grapes, figs, pomegranates, and grain. Half the inhabitants belong to the Beni Kiyain and half to the Beni 'Umr, both attached to the Ghafiri faction and Ibadhis by religion. 2. Selq, the second largest village of Jebel Akhdhar, 1| miles W. of Shareijah. It is built under a scarp, 400 ft. high, and con tains 60 families of the Beni Riyam. Irrigation is carried on by means of a small felej, and two crops of wheat and are reaped in the year ; the gardens contain vines on rude trellises, plum-trees, and pomegranates. Shareijah and Seiq lie on the landward side of the range. The following villages of Western Hajar are all situated on the seaward slope of the watershed. 3. Nakhl, a small town at the head of Wadi Ma'awal; elevation 1,100 ft.; population about 3,500. Its site is enclosed on the S. and E. by mountains, and to the W. lies an intricate country of low hills and ravines ; sheltered from the hot winds of the interior, and receiving the sea-breeze, it possesses an agreeable climate. The settlement, consisting of eleven permanent quarters, is scat tered among date-groves, and occupies an area of about four square miles; there is a bazaar of some 60 shops. The Sultan of Oman maintains a Vali at Nakhl, with a garrison of 25 men. The town possesses a watch-tower on a pinnacle of rock, some 200 ft. high, and between it and a hill called Jebel Laban is a fort on high ground. Nakhl is celebrated for its hot springs (highest tempera ture, 106° F.), of which the greater number rise in gardens at the head of the^ valley. There is one water-mill for grinding flour. 4. 'Awabi, a small town on the 1. bank of the Wadi Beni Kharus .within the hills, about 15 miles W. of Nakhl; elevation, 1,850 ft.;I DISTRICTS 265 hM population, 2,500. There are about 300 houses in the town itself, mostly of mud and stone, but with some huts among them, and Wm another 150 stand on lower ground ; the town possesses a bazaar ml of more than 50 shops. There are some date-groves and con- iwii siderable cultivation. The place is defended by a fort called Beit el-'Awabi, which occupies a strong position commanding the approach I oi from Nakhl. 'Awabi is a town of some importance, dominating ! ati as it does the Wadi Beni Kharus, up which lies the best route to Jebel atwt Akhdhar from the N. The Beni Riyam have perpetually disputed lean its possession with the 'Abriyin, but the influence of the latter, who irotit possess 120 houses in the town, has generally been predominant, kk In 1900 the 'Abriyin transferred possession of the fort to the fin Sultan of Oman, who has since usually held it with a garrison of fj) ft, 30 men. mte, 5. Rostaq, a town of about 400 houses, with mosque and castle, natl in the Wadi Fara', of which it forms the capital; elevation, 800 ft. Hid The inhabitants belong to the Miyayihah tribe, of the Ghafiri political faction. The bazaar is a substantial building and contains is some 80 shops, where every description of merchandise is sold, da The castle, a large and imposing structure, but rather dilapidated, ed i is known as the QaVahKesra, or QaVah Bin-Sharwdn, and is ina said to date from pre-Islamic times. It consists of a citadel with efc four turrets, standing in a courtyard the walls of which are strengthened with bastions at the angles. The climate of Rostaq, , lit like that of Nakhl, is cool and temperate, and the village is sur- m : rounded with plantations of date-palms, mangoes, and plaintains, and orchards of fruit-trees ; there is also considerable cultivation rati of wheat, barley, millet, beans, and lucerne. On the outskirts of the Btk village to the NE., close together, are two thermal springs, among [jjjd the hottest in Oman, enclosed in large circular tanks or reservoirs ; iteior. ^ey contain a considerable quantity of calcareous matter, and are linsfe, used medicinally both for drinking and for ablution. Cold springs, 8 jot- of the temperature of the ground, are also abundant and help to ajiji su Pply the village and the irrigation-conduits. Old In a wider sense the term Rostaq is used for the whole of the etof Wadi Fara' which falls within the district of Western Hajar, including all its villages from Hazam upwards. Employed in this fllijl wider sense, the population of the district has been estimated at mi- 14,000. The Sultan of Oman normally maintains a post of 15 men jjl ^ Mizahit, a village of 200 houses on the 1. bank of the Wadi l|lti Fara' above Hazam and Jammah, and lying within the district (jjjiii of Rostaq. 501; 6. Hazam, a walled village with an important fort, in a plain to I J266 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN the W. of Wadi Fara', from which it is distant less than a mile. It lies below the Hajar hills some 15 miles from Masna'ah, which forms its port. Some have therefore assigned it to the district of Batinah; but there is no doubt that it forms the lowest point in the tract known as Rostaq, and it may therefore be properly included in Western Hajar. The village consists of some 80 houses, the inhabi tants belonging to the Miyayihah and Ya'aribah tribes. There are no wells, and water is brought into the village by subterranean conduits from Wadi Ear a'; there are extensive date-groves and cultivation. The fort, which stands in the middle of the village, can be held by a small garrison, and its position enables it to command the routes in the neighbourhood, especially that to Suweiq. 7. Jammah, a walled town of some 500 houses belonging to the Beni Harras tribe, with extensive date plantations ; it lies opposite Hazam one or two miles to the E. of Wadi Fara', and by some is regarded as included within the district of Batinah. The town is protected by a fort on a hill, which belongs to the Sultan of Oman; but he has never maintained a Vali or garrison here, as Jammah was always loyal to him. 8. Ghaizein, a village of 200 houses on the 1. bank of the Wadi el-Hawasinah, 7 hrs. above its mouth at Khaburah (see p. 252). The village possesses live stock and some date-groves, and is the principal settlement of the Hawasinah tribe. 9. Ghareifah, a village of 200 houses of the Beni 'Isa, on the left bank of the Wadi 'Ahin ; it lies about eight hours from the point where the wadi reaches the coast about half an hour to the W. of the town of Saham (see p. 252). 10. Hibi, a village of 80 houses with some date-groves, at the head of Wadi Sarrami, about a day's journey inland from the town of Saham. There is a fort in which the Sultan of Oman normally maintains a garrison of 40 men under the command of an 11. Heyyadh, a village of 30 houses belonging to the Jahawar and Shabul tribes, on the right bank of the Wadi el-Hilti, abont 3 miles above the point where the valley leaves the hills; there are a few date-palms and scanty cereal cultivation. The village possesses a fort in which the Sultan of Oman normally main tains a garrison of 10 men. 12. 'Ajib, a village on the left bank of the Wadi Hatta, in the extreme NW. of Western Hajar ; it lies a short distance above the point where the valley leaves the hills, about four hours from the town of Shinas (see p. 252) on the coast. The village consists ot 70 houses of the Washahat tribe.DISTRICTS VI. D hahirah 267 The district lying between Western Hajar on the JME. and the Ruba' el-Khali, or Great Desert, on the SW.; at its NW. extremity deiii lies Jau, a district independent of the Sultanate of Oman (see p. 281), iaE and at its SE. end it is divided from Oman Proper by the range of eieffl hhd Kor ; it is about 100 miles in length from NW. to SE., with mm a breadth of about half that distance. Dhahirah consists of a plain euil of uneven surface, sloping from the foot-hills of Western Hajar to if, the Great Desert in which the whole of its drainage is lost. It siti possesses two principal valleys, the Wadi Dhank, which runs down kitli| from Hajar, at first from N. to S. and then westward, leaving the hills by a precipitous gorge just above the town of Dhank, and thence ;tol losing itself in the desert; and the Wadi el-Kebir, which runs WSW. pi from Hajar towards 'Ibri, becomes the Wadi Saneisal in the neigh bourhood of that town, and receives the Wadi Sharsah and the Wadi el-'Ain from the E., the former joining it a little above and the latter ]■: a little below 'Ibri. Mil The principal hills of the district are offshoots and outliers of the Hajar range, and include Jebel F (or an isolated group jfi of low hills about 25 miles to the NW. of 'Ibri; some hills around ill 'Ibri itself, which rise 300 or 400 ft. above the plain ; and some list scattered hillocks, bordering the desert between 'Ibri and Jebel Fuleij. TheNW. slopes of Jebel Kor also lie within Dhahirah, as fci well as a ridge known as Jebel Haddah, which runs WNW. from the epiii S. end of Jebel Kor. The district varies in elevation from 1,200 ft. ifi at 'Ibri to 2,750 ft. at Miskin. W. of Dhank the plain of Dhahirah is generally stony or shingly, with a scanty growth of mimosa and jti acacia that affords winter grazing for thousands of Bedouin goats, isti S. of Dhank the plain becomes more sandy, but between Jebel K5r flil and Jebel Haddah it is covered with debris from the hills, and 1;S mimosa again makes its appearance. Scrub jungles clothe the open jp plains by which Dhahirah merges into the Great Desert along its , stf whole south-western border. ; til There is an important nomad population in Dhahirah, belonging If chiefly to the Na'im and 'Awamir tribes in the NW., and to the Daru' b # in the S., but their numerical strength has not been ascertained. The settled population of the district has been estimated at a little jil over 31,000. The towns and villages are strung along the five great old wadis, the Wadi el-Kebir being the most densely populated (8,000, dint with 6,400 in Wadi Saneisal, its continuation), and next to it is the li# Wadi Dhank (pop. 7,300). The water-supply is generally obtained from springs. : ill n i268 THE SULTANATE OP OMAN The principal settlements are described in the following para graphs, arranged in order from Dhank up the wadi to which it gives its name, and then down the Wadi Kebir (with Maqniyat on one of its tributaries), and finally down the Wadis Saneisal and Sharsah: 1. Dhank (pronounced Danch), the second largest town of Dha- hirah (being exceeded in size by Tbri), at the mouth of the pre cipitous gorge by which the Wadi Dhank leaves the hills of Western Hajar ; population 3,500, belonging in the main to different sections of the Na'im tribe. The town lies on the right bank, and is divided into two parts by a ridge of dark basaltic rock, the base of which is washed by the stream. The upper town consists of about 400 houses in five quarters, and the lower town (Sifdkh) of about 300 houses in seven quarters, each quarter being separately walled. There is a fortress in the upper town which is long and narrow owing to the configuration of the ground ; its curtain-walls are strengthened by six turrets. The houses are mostly built of sun-dried brick and are interspersed with date-palms and gardens; there is a small bazaar, and on the outskirts of the town are date- groves, orchards of limes and pomegranates, and some cultivation of wheat, lucerne, and indigo. Water for irrigation is raised from wells by bullocks. The stream in the Wadi Dhank, which is here rapid, diminishes considerably in the hot season, but there are then heavy dews at night. 2. Dut, a village on the right bank of the Wadi Dhank, with some date plantations. It consists of about 100 houses of the Bidah and Sa'idah tribes. 3. Fida, a village on the right bank of the Wadi Dhank, two miles above Dut, consisting of about 200 houses of the Beni Zid. The date plantations of the village form a long and narrow fringe in the valley. 4. Yanqul, a village on the left bank of the Wadi Dhank, two miles above hi da. It consists of about 200 houses of the Beni 'Ali, and possesses some date plantations. 5. Wuqbah, a village on the right bank of the Wadi Dhank, with considerable date plantations, about five hours above Yanqul. It consists of about 160 houses of the Beni 'Ali. 6. Miskin, a village near the head of Wadi el-Kebir; elevation 2,750 ft. It consists^of about 200 houses of the Beni Kelban tribe, belonging to the Jarawinah, 'Ameirah, and Subeih sections. There are considerable date plantations ; wheat, and lucerne are grown, and m the orchards the mango, plantain, fig, a11 ^ vine nourish. The fields are fenced with thorny branches;DISTRICTS 269 water for irrigation is brought in channels from springs. The village lies on the usual route between Rostaq and Dhank (see Route No. 72, vol. ii, pp. 326 ff.). 7. Maqniyat, a town on the inland slopes of Western Hajar, but reckoned as belonging to the district of Dhahirah. It lies in a valley known as the Wadi Bilad Shahum, a tributary of the Wadi el-Kebir, which rises near the head of Wadi Beni Ghafir. It consists of some 740 mud houses of the Beni Kelban tribe, belonging to the 'Ameirah, Ghababin, Jerawinah, Sinan, and Subeih sections. The town possesses considerable date-groves, and wheat, millet, and lucerne are grown. While many of the inhabitants are engaged in cultiva tion, others are camel-men and donkey-men ; they own some 200 camels and 600 donkeys, which ply from Khaburah and Sohar on the Batinah coast (see above, p. 251 f.) to 'Ibri and Dhank in Dhahirah. 8. 'Aridh, a village on the right bank of Wadi el-Kebir, about thirteen hours below Miskin ; elevation 1,250 ft. It consists of about 320 houses of the Beni Kelban (Jerawinah section) and the Shakeil tribes. It possesses date-palms and cultivation, but the inhabitants are carriers as well as cultivators, owning some 40 camels and 100 donkeys. 9. Dariz, a village four hours below 'Aridh, in a side valley of Wadi el-Kebir, known as Qarn el-Kabsh. It consists of some 230 houses, most of them belonging to the Miyayihah tribe. There are a few date-palms and a dilapidated fort, 10. Beit el-'Ainein, a fort in the Wadi Saneisal, below the junction of the Wadis Kebir and Sharsah. It consists of a building with two flanking towers, and has the reputation of being the second strongest fortress in Dhahirah. For many years its possession was fiercely con tested by the surrounding tribes, and it is now occupied by a tribal garrison of the Miyayihah, who also hold an adjoining hamlet of 20 huts and a large date-grove watered by three fdejs. The place is also known by the name of Saneisal. 11. 'Araqi, a village on the right bank of Wadi Saneisal, just below Beit el-Ainein, and about two miles above 'Ibri. It consists of some 225 houses, of which about 100 belong to the 'Abriyin tribe, 90 to the Beni Rashid, and 35 to Baluchis ; there are some date plantations. The place is of importance owing to its fort, which came into the possession of the Sultan of Oman in 1904, and con stituted his only foothold in Dhahirah. In normal times the Sultan stations a Vali at 'Araqi, and about $100 is collected annually as Zalcdt and expended locally. The former village of Ghahhi, which lay just below 'Araqi on the270 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN right bank of the wadi, was destroyed in the tribal wars about 1875 • it now consists of only two houses, garrisoned and used as forts bv the Beni Kelban and Ya'aqib tribes. 12. 'Ibri, a large town in the Wadi Saneisal, the capital of Dha- hirah, standing on a low hill known as Harbarah elevation 1180 ft • population about 5,000, of whom about 3,500 belong to the Ya'aqib tribe, and a proportion of the remainder to the Beni Kelban. The town is enclosed, except on the S. side, by hills rising some 300 or 400 ft. above the plain at a short distance from it. It is divided into sixteen quarters, the bazaar and the poorer quarters form ing a compact block surrounding a small fort with tower. The bazaar, consisting of about 70 or 80 shops, is dirty, is the largest and most frequented in Dhahirah ; here all supplies such as are required by the Bedouins can be obtained, and here, too, booty collected during raids used to be disposed of to the highest bidder. The great mosque, said to be the largest Ibadhi mosque in Oman, is a plain and undecorated structure. The houses of the wealthier inhabitants are scattered in the sea of date-groves surrounding the town, which, with the exception of those of Wadi Sema'il (see pp. 259 ff.), are probably the most extensive in Oman. Ibri is famous for its fruit : in addition to dates, limes, mangoes, peaches, apricots, quinces, figs, bananas, oranges, pomegranates, pomaloes, almonds, plums, guavas, citrons, melons, and others are grown and largely exported. Abundant water is brought from the adjacent hills by two large conduits, which suffice to irrigate the whole of the oasis with its rich orchards and cornfields. At 'Ibri, as at Adam (see below, p. 275), the Arabs of the eastern desert sell large numbers of the young camels which they have reared, and these are distributed from 'Ibri to other parts of Oman. 13. Saleif, a village on both banks of the Wadi el-Ain, near its junction with the Wadi Saneisal, is only two miles ESE. of 'Ibri, of which it is practically a suburb. It consists of some 350 houses, 150 belonging to the Manadharah and Suwawifah tribes. There is a. small fort on the E. bank of the wadi overlooking an aqueduct; dates and lucerne are grown. . . 14 - a village of about i80 houses, in the Wadi Sharsah, which joins the Wadi Saneisal from the E. between Beit el-Ainein and Darrz. The inhabitants belong to the Maqabil tribe, Ghafiri in politics. Water from wells. 15. Wahrah, a village in the Wadi Sharsah below Bat. It consists of about 100 houses of the Miyayihah tribe, who are engaged in cultivation.DISTRICTS 271 VII. Oman Proper This district consists of a central plateau shut in on the N. by Jebel Akhdhar and on the S. by the desert. On the E. the range of Jebel Kor, running N. and S. for 20 miles as an offshoot of the Hajar hill system, forms a natural barrier which separates it from Dhahirah. On the W. side there is no natural boundary dividing it from Sharqiyah, unless it be the Wadi 'Andam. Until the removal of the capital to Rostaq (see p. 265) and eventu ally to the coast, Oman Proper was the principal seat of political power, as well as the most prosperous and civilized district, in Oman. The term Oman {'Oman) appears to have belonged originally to this inland plateau and from it to have spread to the whole princi pality. Its two main channels of drainage are the and the Wddi Halfein, both of which traverse it from N. to S., the former from Nizwa near the centre of the province, the latter from Izki at its eastern extremity. The Wadi Halfein is probably the longest in this part of Arabia ; beyond the border of the province it runs S. by E. through the desert until it reaches the sea at Mah5t (see p. 278). The Wadi Kalbu probably falls into the Wadi Halfein in the desert. The surface of Oman Proper, outside the oases, is rough and broken. The central portion, called the ' hollow ' or ' basin ', contains the towns of Bahlah, Nizwa, and Izki; it is a stony plain thickly dotted with small volcanic hills and mounds, some of conical shape. The N. part, under Jebel Akhdhar, is very barren and seamed with dry water-courses. A wide and level surface with a gentle declivity to the S. separates Izki from Manah, and this con tinues between Manah and Adam to the border of the desert, being sprinkled with dwarf mimosa and bunches of desert grass. At many places in Oman Proper the springs are hot, their temperature ranging from 102° to 112° F. The settled population of the district is said to be about 34,300. The Bedouins of Oman Proper are numerous, and belong to Jannabah 'Awamir, Al-Wahibah, Daru', A1 Khameyyis, and other tribes. The following are the principal towns and villages, arranged in order from W. to E. and then southwards :— 1. Seifam ,a flourishing village at the W. end of the province under Jebel Kor in Wadi Seifam ; elevation 1,900 ft. It consists of about 180 houses, with date plantations; it is the head-quarters of the Beni Shakeil, 2. Bahlah, a town in the W. end of the province, about 20 miles W. of Nizwa, on the left bank of the Wadi Bahlah, which appears to be a tributary of Wadi Halfein ; elevation 1,600 ft.; population272 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN about 3,000. The town is composed of a number of distinct villages ^ or walled quarters, and its site, which with the surrounding date 1^ groves and cultivation forms an irregular parallelogram about :ia| two square miles in extent, is also enclosed by a wall. In the centre ^ rises a huge white fort with two towers, one of which is very loftv ,lW and commands a view of the whole valley ; around, on various W sides the plain is broken by low hills less than 2 miles distant The ! inhabitants belong to several tribes, of which the most numerous are ^ the Abnyin and Bayasirah. fctat Under the Nabhani dynasty, who ruled at the beginning of the !* ! seventeenth century, Bahlah was for a time the capital of all Oman * borne 4 miles to the SW. is Jabrln (elevation 1,800ft.), now a ruinous ^ v &lt;- fT 6 whlch are tlie dwellings of a few cultivators. Under the Ya anbah, once an important tribe which between a. d . 1625 and ^ 1744 supplied the rulers of Oman, Jabrin was for a short time the capital. 14 3. Hamra, a small town on the left bank of Wadi Ghol, with '•I date-groves, a few miles NE. of Bahlah. It consists of about 300 W houses, built of stone and gypsum, and is occupied bv the 'Abriyin tribe. _ ■ fci a village to the NW. of Nizwa, at the point where Wadi Tanuf leaves Jebel Akhdhar ; elevation 1,950 ft. There are two gates in the wall,^ on the E. and W. sides, and within are about ^1® 40 nouses of the Beni Riyam tribe. The Sheikh's house is behind the town, on the edge of the Wadi Tanuf, up which a track (the Tarlq esh-Shass) leads over Jebel Akhdhar to 'Awabi. The site of the village underneath the cliffs is cramped, and, shut in as it is by c !f8H the mountains, the heat during the summer months is intolerable, fcfej There are date plantations and considerable cultivation. 5. Nizwa, a large unwalled town, the most central of the district, fci some 20 miles W. of Izki and about the same distance from Bahlah; kfeni elevation 1,900 ft. ; population about 6,000. It occupies a gentle ^]k[ sdope, intersected by converging streams and wadis, at the base of Jebel Akhdhar. Towards the S. it is screened by broken ground olilicl and low hills, the summits of which are in many cases crowned with towers. Both strategically and commercially its site is important. Hej It is well adapted for defence, and commands the mouths of the two fclort chief passes leading from Jebel Akhdhar by Wadi Tanuf and Wadi 13,1] Mi aidin , and from its proximity to Izki it draws to itself the traffic 'o lusi that is carried up the Wadi Sem^il from the coast. For long it was i 12# the capital of Oman. It lies at the junction of four streams, and surpasses most of the Uj towns oi Oman m its abundant water-supply, its natural wealth, and %] rDISTRICTS 273 the industry of its inhabitants. It is divided into an upper town ('Alayah) and a lower town (Sifalah) by the Wadi Kalbu, the former lying up-stream on the E. bank ; it is also traversed by the Wadi el-Abyadh, which joins Wadi Kalbu near the market-place. The water-supply of the upper town depends on a stream known as Daris, that of the lower town on one called Ghunduq. The houses are of stone, many two storeys high, but the streets are narrow. Though the city is unwalled, it contains a number of walled quarters, the houses being intermingled with date-palms, fruit orchards, and gardens; date-groves succeed one another continuously as far as Eaddah, five miles down the wadi. The great fortress of Nizwa, in the upper town, is reputed the strongest in Oman, though it does not occupy an elevated position and is hemmed in on all sides by dwelling-houses. It consists of a large quadrangular enclosure, the at one angle of which is the citadel, known as the Qal'ah, a huge circular tower of solid masonry without window or loophole, on which are mounted several parapet guns. The walls are immensely thick and well preserved, the whole construction resting on a solid base which rises to a con siderable height above the level of the plain. The bazaar, which is near the fort, is well supplied. The traders include coppersmiths, braziers, dyers, makers of camel-saddles, potters, silversmiths, cobblers, cameleen-weavers, carpenters, makers of (the national sweetmeat which is largely exported and for which Nizwa is famous), blacksmiths, sugar and treacle-makers, masons, mat- weavers, &amp;c. The most noteworthy part of the bazaar is the copper-market; the metal is imported in bars and sheets from Bombay, and the finished copper and brass work is distributed throughout Oman. The dominant tribes in the population are the Beni Riyam and the Beni Hina, who are mutually jealous and distrustful. The Beni Riyam occupy the upper town, and their position enables them to cut off the water-supply from the lower town, the strongest quarter of which is occupied by the Beni Hina. Of the other tribes repre sented the A1 Bu Sa'id is the most numerous. Nizwa is normally in the possession of the Sultan of Oman, who maintains a Vali in the fort with a garrison of 30 men commanded by an l Aqld. About 13,000 is collected annually as Z but no balance is remitted to Muscat. The Sultan owns date-groves, of an annual value of $2,000, which are assigned to the Vali towards the expenses of administration. 6. Farq, a large village on the 1. bank of the Wadi Kalbu, 3 miles below Nizwa, in the continuous belt of date-groves. It consists of ARABIA I o274 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN about 150 houses, mainly of the Beni 'Auf and 'Abriyin tribes. Much wheat and indigo are grown. 7. Birkat el-M6z, a large village about 6 miles W. of Izki, on the northern edge of the plain of Oman Proper, at the point where Wadi Mi'aidin emerges from Jebel Akhdhar ; population about 1,400, of which some 1,250 belong to the Beni Riyam, who occupy the chief of its three quarters. There are extensive date-groves, and plantains (to which the place owes its name) are numerous. Irrigation is by felej. To the W. of the village is a watch-tower on a conical hill, commanding the water-supply. Beyond it is a fort, known as the Beit Rudeidah, and consisting of a rectangular enclosure with an upper storey and towers at the corners; it was formerly held by a relative of the Sultan of Oman, but at present is in the hands of the Beni Biyam. 8. Muti, a large village on the right bank of Wadi Halfein, 4 miles above Izki; elevation 2,300 ft. It consists of about 300 houses, and is occupied by the Beni Riyam ; it possesses numerous date- groves. 9. Izki (or Zikki), an important town on both banks of the Wadi Halfein, about 12 miles below its head ; elevation, 2,150 ft.; popu lation about 4,000. The quarter on the 1. bank contains some 450 houses of the Beni Riyam. The right bank is higher, and here is the walled quarter of the Beni Ruwahah, with a compact and massive fort, having walls 5 ft. thick, and standing on a cliff 200 ft. above the bed of the wadi. The opposite quarters are constantly at feud, the one being Ghafiri, the other Hinawi in politics. The bed of the wadi is here broad, and contains extensive palm-groves and other cultivation, especially on the left bank, which is low and fertile. Irrigation is from springs, which are among the most copious in Oman. Outside the settlement are several hamlets and watch-towers. The fort of Izki is of great strategic importance, for it dominates the main artery of traffic between the coast and the interior by way of the Wadi Sema'il. In normal times it is held by the Sultan of Oman, who maintains a Vali there with a garrison of 20 men; $1,600 is collected annually as Za but the whole is absorbed in the expenses of local administration. 10. Falaj el-'Awamir, a group of villages in the Wadi Halfein or in its neighbourhood, below Izki, all occupied by the Awamir tribe. The two largest are Qal'at el-'Awamir, containing about 70 houses and a fort, and Hameidhah, a village of some 50 mud houses and huts. 11. Manah, an important town, about 12 miles SSE. of NizwaDISTRICTS 275 and 16 miles SW. of Izki, the centre of a highly cultivated oasis about 3 miles in diameter ; elevation (according to Miles) 1,350 ft.; total population about 4,500. The town is rather scattered, the four principal quarters being Bildd in the centre, containing about 300 houses ; Fiqain to the NE., with some 200 houses of the A1 Bu Sa'id; Ma'mad to the S., with 250 houses ; and to the E. with 140 houses of the Beni Riyam. The houses are of mud and stone, some of them with upper storeys. Bilad, the largest and central quarter, contains the principal fort and two square watch- towers, one of which, known as Minarah, is 170 ft. high. There is a second fort in the Fiqain quarter, the residence of a Vali, main tained by the Sultan of Oman, with a garrison of 15 men. There are considerable date-groves and cultivation, irrigated from hot springs. 12. Adam, an isolated town and oasis, 25 miles SSW. of Manah, on the edge of the Ruba' el-Khali; elevation, 850 ft.; population about 3,000, mainly of the Mohariq and Al Bu Sa'id tribes. The town is divided into eight quarters, and is defended by a huge fortress garrisoned by the Mohariq. Three aqueducts provide a copious supply of water from hot springs. Adam is the most advanced town in Oman towards the desert, and forms a con venient market for the Bedouins. VIII. Sharqiyah The inland district to the E. of Oman Proper, bounded on the N. by the foot-hills of Eastern Hajar and merging on the S. into the Great Desert; at its SE. corner it meets the district of Ja'alan, which some authorities would regard as part of it, Sharqiyah con sists of four tracts, or divisions, which run from NW. to SE. in the following order : Baldan el-Habus, Baldan el-Masakirah, Baldan el-Hirth, and Badiyah. The last-named division is an open sandy plain, the others consisting of a network of small valleys adjoining the Hajar hills. The district is traversed by a line of drainage, known in its upper course as the Wadi Ibra and in its lower as the Wadi el-Ha'imah; this is followed and described in Route No. 70, vol. ii, pp. 313 if. The following are the principal villages in order from NW. to SE. : 1. Samad, town and oasis on left bank of the Wadi Samad in the Baldan el-Habus division; population about 2,500. The Habus and Jahadhim are the most numerous of the tribal elements repre sented in the town. 2. Mudheibi, the second largest town of Sharqiyah, situated in S 2276 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN the Baldan el-Habus division ; population, 3,500 or more, belonging to the Habus, Hajriyin, Al Wahibah, and Hirth tribes. There are extensive date-groves and a fine spring. 3. Sana'u, town in the Baldan el-Habus division, about 4 miles E. of Mudheibi; population nearly 3,600. The town stands on a hill with date-palms below ; the houses are of mud, some of them with upper storeys. The most numerous elements in the population belong to the Beni Rashid and Suwawifah tribes. 4. Ibra, the largest and most central town of Sharqiyah, about 35 miles ESE. of Samad ; population, 4,000-5,000. The town lies partly in the Baldan el-Hirth, partly in the Baldan el-Masakirah division. It is divided into two quarters, the upper town to the N. and E., consisting of about 300 houses and occupied byMasakirah, the lower town to the S., comprising some 600 houses inhabited by Hirth. The upper town is unwalled, but a part of the lower town is walled and possesses a fort; each town has its own bazaar, and there are extensive date-plantations. 5. Mudheirib, small town of about 300 houses in the Baldan el-Hirth division, inhabited by Hirth. It possesses a small bazaar of about 20 shops, and some date plantations. IX. J a'lan A district to the SE. of Sharqiyah, extending for about 50 miles from the border of Badiyah to the coast at Lashkharah. On the N. it is partly bounded by, and partly includes, the foot-hills of Eastern Hajar, and to the S. it is bordered by the desert; its length of seaboard is not accurately determined, but it certainly includes the strip of coast between Ras er-Ruweis and Lashkharah. The fixed population of the district is estimated at about 12,000, and belongs to the Beni Bu 'Ali, Beni Bu Hasan, Hishm, and Beni Rasib tribes ; the numbers of the Bedouins who frequent the district have not been ascertained. The principal towns are Wafi, Kamil, and Lashkharah. Of these Kamil is described under Route No. 70, vol. ii, p. 314; Wafi and Lashkharah, with the intermediate villages and settlements, are described under the Branch Route, vol. ii, p. 317. X. T he S outh -E ast C oast and D hofar The strip of country from the S. border of Ja'lan to Ras Nus, which marks the eastern limit of Dhofar, has no general title but falls within the area of the Oman Sultanate. It is a barren stretchDISTRICTS 277 of coast, nearly 450 miles in length, backed by the Great Desert, and it possesses no place of importance with the exception of Mahot. It is traversed by Route No. 69 (see vol. ii, pp. 310 if.), which runs from Makalla on the Hadhramaut coast to Lashkharah. Such villages as exist are small and inhabited by migratory fisher- folk, many of whom have no boats and put to sea on inflated skins. They dispose of shark-fins to passing vessels in exchange for dates, grain, and cloth. The principal features of the country are described in the following subsections, the first of which deals with the coast line as far as Ras Nus, and the second with the region of Dhofar. 1. The Coast betweenJa'ldn The chief features of the coast from NE. to SW. are the following. To the S. of Lashkharah it continues low, sandy, and desolate. A stretch of nearly 100 miles, from Ras Jibsh to RasJMishayu, is known as Batein and is inhabited by Jannabah and Al Wahibah. This is bounded on the S. by the B a blunt promon tory 18 miles broad and only 12 miles long, the domain of the Hikman tribe. It is low and sandy, and contains a large salt-water lagoon called Khor el-Milh, divided from the sea by a narrow ridge of sand. The Hikman Arabs and the inhabitants of Mahot and of the island of Masirah (see p. 278) resort to the fish and make salt; and boats from Sur load salt here for their own town and for India. To the W. of the promontory is a large bay, Hashish, some 8 miles broad and 10 long, with soundings decreasing from 6 fathoms in the middle of the entrance, and with a low and sandy shore. Near its head are two islands, Abb and Mahot, joined by a mud-bank 4 miles long, which dries at low water. On the latter is the village of Mahot, the principal trade centre for this part of the Oman coast (see p. 278). The section of the coast from Ghubbah Hashish to Ras Madrakah is known as Bahr el-Hadri. Here hills once more make an appear ance, and for nearly a third of its length, towards its southern end, a line of bold cliffs of light-coloured limestone fronts the sea. The Jannabah frequent the region for some miles to the N. of Ras Madrakah, which is 450 ft. high. Sauqirah extends from Ras Madrakah to Ras Sauqirah, a prominent bluff rising 600 ft. above the sea. To this barren region a few Jannabah and Mahrahs come in winter to fish and graze their cattle; they camp under the sails of their boats and attack strangers if unarmed. Near its southern end is Jazir, a favourite winter camping-ground. This is the only point where the land route from Oman to Dhofar strikes the coast278 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN (see the Alternative Route, from Salalah to Adam, described under Route No. 69, vol. ii, p. 312); here water can be obtained by digging in the low ground near the sea. For the next 24 miles, from Ras Sauqirah to Ras Sharbatat, there stretches a table-land bounded by a limestone cliff, 600 ft. in height, falling precipitously into the sea. The character of the country does not change in the last section, from Ras Sharbatat to Ras Nus, which forms a slight bay 82 miles long. Here the plateau is from 500 to 800 ft. in height, generally ending in cliffs which are of pale brown limestone; about the middle of the bay, at Ras Shuwaniyah, there is an outcrop of igneous rock. Some 12 miles to the N. of Ras Nus is the Wadi Reikhut, a well-wooded valley, with a spring of fresh water and a brackish lake near its mouth. To the S. of it, at the mouth of a valley thickly wooded with small trees, is Hasik, now a miserable village, but once a thriving town. In the hay, running E. from a point opposite Reikhut, are the Kuria Muria Islands, now a British possession (see p. 282 f.). The two principal islands off the coast, which are within the jurisdiction of the Sultanate, are the following :— 1 . Mahot, an island with village of the same name, in Ghuhbah Hashish, some 3 or 4 miles from the mainland, to which it is pos sible to cross at low tide. The island is a mere sandbank, 2 miles long and 1 mile broad, devoid of vegetation with the exception of mangroves, which grow on a mud-flat round two-thirds of its circum ference and screen it from the sea. The place possesses no regular shops and few large boats, but it is constantly visited by caravans from Adam (see above, p. 275, and cf. Route No. 70, vol. ii, p. 311). Water is fetched daily by slaves, who carry it in earthen vessels from wells under a low hill on the mainland 4 miles to the N. The inhabitants are Hikman and a few Jannabah, and they maintain a perpetual feud with the Al Wahibah of the mainland. 2. Masirah, the only large and important island now included in the Sultanate. It is 40 miles in length, opposite Barr el-Hikman (see p. 277), and runs parallel to the coast, from which it is 10 miles distant. It is traversed along its length by a chain of hills, of which the highest summit, Jebel Madhrub (620 ft.), lies in the NE. corner. The island is almost destitute of vegetation; stunted trees and shrubs grow sparsely in the plains, and date-palms are few and of poor quality. The permanent population numbers about 600, mainly of the Jannabah, but including a few Hikman. They subsist on fish and an edible turtle, which is here abundant, on dates imported from Batinah and Oman Proper, and on Indian rice from Sur. Sheep and goats are few, owing to scarcity of pasture.DISTRICTS 279 The climate is unhealthy. In the monsoon tribesmen and Bedouins from the mainland frequent the N. end of the island with the object of wrecking ; in 1904, at Jidufah, they massacred the crew of the Baron Inverdale. 2, Dhofdr In its widest sense, as a separate district of the Oman Sultanate, the term Dhofar is employed for the whole coastal tract, from Has Nus westward to a point beyond the village of Kharifot. Used in this sense it has a length of 134 miles and a maximum breadth inland, across the Dhofar plain, of 20 miles ; it consists in the main of barren hills, at no great distance from the sea, forming an irregular and discontinuous range known as Samhdn. More properly the term denotes the maritime plain between the Samhan hills and the sea, from the Khor Rori westward to Ras Risut, a distance of some 30 miles. In a still more restricted sense it is applied to the villages Hafah and Salalah, which together contain two-thirds of the population of the plain. There is no large harbour in Dhofar, and landing is difficult because of the surf. The bays of Murbat and Risut afford good anchorage for small vessels in the NE. and SW. monsoons respectively ; but only fishing-boats, and practically no sea-going vessels, are owned in Dhofar. The most valuable export is frankincense from the Samhan hills, which is carried to Bombay in native boats. The seasons are here regulated chiefly by the monsoons. The SW. monsoon, which brings rain, arrives about June 11, and is sometimes preceded for 10 days by a severe gale from the S. or SE. In December and January the climate is pleasant. Of the two great tribes of the district, the Qaras are found chiefly in the Samhan hills, and speak a language of their own. The A1 Kathir, occurring both in the hills and on the plain, are said to speak an Arabic dialect which differs considerably from that of the Persian Gulf. The villagers are agriculturists, but indolent; the blood-feud flourishes, and the population continues to decrease, in spite of efforts to introduce a more stable system of administration and control. The district is ruled by a Vali appointed by the Sultan of Oman. The revenue from sea-customs (about $5,000 a year), (esti mated at $15,000 a year), and from animals (generally received in kind) only suffices to cover expenses of government. The military force normally consists of from 50 to 200 askaris, or armed levies, most of them raised locally and paid from the local revenues. The280 THE SULTANATE OF OMAN inhabitants believe that their own cultivation and their flocks and herds would suffice for their subsistence if outside intercourse were cut off ; but, as there are no local manufactures, a blockade of the coast would certainly reduce them to great straits for clothing The plain of Dhofar could be crossed with field-guns, but the track along the coast, which connects the plain with the Murbat anchors^ would be difficult for artillery. g ' The principal settlements are on the coast, and are the following arranged in order from E. to W. : 1. Murbat, a village of about 150 huts and houses, some of stone on the shore about a mile to the N. of Has Murbat, which affords a perfectly sheltered anchorage from the NE. monsoon; depth of water from 6 to 7 fathoms at less than half a mile off shore. The water-supply is from wells in the bed of Wadi Murbat, which comes down to the sea 1 mile to the NW. of the village. The Vali of Dhofar maintains a garrison here of 20 askaris, but the real ruler of Murbat is the sheikh. 2. Dahariz, a village of about 100 houses of mud and stone, inhabited by fishermen and cultivators, 4 miles E. of Hafah ; on the W. side are cotton-fields and a grove of coco-nut palms. 3. Hafah, a village of about 150 houses of mud and stone, with coco-nut plantations, about 2 miles E. of Salalah. 4. El-Hisn, the principal fort in Dhofar, about 100 yards from the beach, half a mile W. of Hafah. It covers an acre of ground and contains a substantial three-storeyed building ; the entrance is on the E. side. 5. Salalah, the capital of Dhofar, half a mile inland, and about 6 miles from the W. end of the Dhofar plain. It consists of two divisions, a quarter of a mile apart. The eastern division contains about 150 houses, some with upper storeys, and a large mosque; the western division consists of about 100 houses. All the houses are of stone, and to the N. of each division is a cemetery sur rounded by a low wall. The population belongs to the Al Kethir tribe, and a few traders from Shihr reside here during the summer months ; there is a garrison of 20 askaris. Cotton and wheat are cultivated, as well as tobacco, sugar-cane, melons, and a few fig-trees. 6. Risut, at the western extremity of the Dhofar plain, consists of a mud-built bazaar of from 15 to 20 shops, which are permanently occupied by traders ; and a guard of 10 or 15 askaris is always posted here. In the trading season, between March and September, the number of shops is increased to 40 or 50. There is a spring of fresh water a mile and a half up a ravine behind the settlement.DISTRICTS 281 The place stands on a bay facing E., with Has Risut (200 ft. high) on the S. side of it; the beach is sandy. 7. Rakhyut, or Reikhut, on the coast, about 13 miles W. of Ras Sajar, is a village of 60 or 70 mud houses at the mouth of a ravine. 8. Kharifot, 4 miles W. of Rakhyut, is a village of about 30 houses, and the westernmost settlement in Dhofar. It possesses a stream of running water and a date-grove at the mouth of a ravine. B. INDEPENDENT OMAN There are two small independent tracts between the Oman Sultanate and Trucial Oman, to which the Sultan of Oman has never laid claim; these are described in the following sections, which also include an account of the Kuria Muria Islands, ceded by the Sultan to Great Britain in 1854. 1. Jau and the Bireimi Oasis The more important tract is Jau, pronounced locally Jo, a plain which includes Jebel Hafit and the villages near the S. end of that chain. Its principal settlement, the Bireimi Oasis, lies to N. of Jebel Hafit, and is nearly circular in form, with a diameter of about 6 miles ; total population about 5,500. The oasis contains a group of villages, scattered among the date plantations and orchards ; the dwellings are mainly huts, constructed of mats and date-leaves, but they include a few mud houses. Bireimi, the village which gives its name to the settlement, is near the centre of the oasis, and consists of eight quarters. Here is a fort of sun-dried brick, with a tower at each corner 40 ft. high, the whole surrounded by a ditch 25 ft. broad ; there are two wells in the interior, giving good water in sufficient quantity for a large garrison. Of the remaining nine villages and hamlets in the oasis, the more important are Jlmi, a village of about 200 houses not far from Bireimi and nearly in the centre of the oasis ; about 120 houses, a mile and a half NW. of Bireimi; about 200 houses, 3 miles SW. of Bireimi; and known also as 'Ain, about 280 houses, some 3 miles S. of Bireimi. The inhabitants of the oasis belong chiefly to the Dhawahir, but they include some Na'im and a few Beni Yas. The Na'im are the original owners of the oasis, and their possession of the fort in Bireimi village gives them local prestige. The population subsist mainly on dates, coarse bread, rice, and salt fish, the last named282 INDEPENDENT OMAN being carried up in considerable quantities from the coast • the flesh of goats and camels is also eaten. Milk is abundant' and a hard cream-cheese is made. The women wear a black veil and high-heeled shoes ; they spin, weave, make felt, and tend the goats and cattle. There are no special industries, and much of the labour is done by slaves. Many fruits are grown in addition to dates, and there is considerable cereal cultivation ; abundant water for irriga tion is obtained by felej from the hills, sometimes several miles distant. Beyond the oasis the plain is covered with grass and shrubs, on which the Bedouins pasture their herds of sheep and camels. Though Bireimi is independent, the influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi (see p. 337) is strong and increasing; a regular tribute is paid him by the Dhawahir tribe, who have made the Bireimi oasis their head-quarters. 2. M ahadhah A plain lying some 15 to 20 miles to the NE. of the Bireimi Oasis. It is said to be surrounded by hills on the E. and S. sides, but the country is lower on the W. and N. It is the head-quarters of the Beni Ka c ab tribe, Ghafiri in politics and Sunnis by religion. It contains only one village, Mahadhah, consisting of about 220 houses of sun-dried brick and stone. These are scattered in unwalled groups among date-groves, which cover an area two or three miles in diameter ; irrigation is by felej. The place maintains relations chiefly with Bireimi Oasis, Sharjah, and Dibai. The principalities of Trucial Oman are described in the following chapter on the Gulf Coast; see pp. 333 ff. 3. T he K uria M ueia I slands (B ritish P ossession) A group of five islands, 25 miles off the south-east coast of Oman, between Has Sharbatat and Ras Nus, to the NE. of Dhofar. They are of granite, and form a chain running for 50 miles due E. and W. ; they stand upon a granite ledge with very deep water immediately outside. During the NE. monsoon they are exposed to winds from all points of the compass. Hallaniyah, the largest and central island of the group, is the only one at present inhabited. It is 7| miles long from E. to W., and 3J miles broad from N. to S. ; one of the hills in its centre rises to a height of 1,503 ft. Water is abundant but slightly brackish. The few inhabitants are reported to speak a dialect akin to that oiDISTRICTS 283 Murbat on the mainland and resembling Mahri. They live in semi circular huts, with walls of loose stones, roofed with sticks, fish bones and seaweed. They keep goats, and engage in fishing, but have no boats. In 1835 they numbered 23, and had increased to 36 in 1883 ; but in 1901 the island was found to be temporarily de serted. In 1835 Suda, the second largest island, was also inhabited ; the remaining islands are known as Hdsiklyah, and Gharzaut. The origin of the English name for the islands, 'Kuria Muria', is unknown. The Arabs know them as Jezair after a Mahrah family called Bin Ghalfan, who once seized them, and in 1835 still claimed them as their property. They had been raided, and the settlements depopulated, by pirates from Trucial Oman in 1818. In 1854 the Sultan of Oman, who had established a title to the group, ceded them to Great Britain, and they have since re mained a British possession. Between 1857 and 1859 the rich guano deposits of Jibliyah and Hasikiyah were worked out. A British telegraph station was established on Hallaniyah in 1859, but it was removed in the following year.CHAPTER IX THE GULF COAST T his chapter is concerned with the countries of the Arabian littoral from Turkish 'Iraq in the N. to the promontory of Oman in the SE. They are separated from Central Arabia along their whole length on the W. by desert tracts, but connected with Nejd and Jebel Shammar by caravan routes more practicable for the trader than those which start from the Red Sea. Beginning from the N. the territories in question are as follows : the Sultanate of Koweit, the Province of Hasa, the Principality of Bahrein, the Peninsula of El-Qatar, and the group of sheikhdoms known as Trucial Oman. The coast is the chief centre of the pearl industry; and its increasing trade with India lends it a high significance for the British Empire. As the only good harbour in the north, Koweit may attain enhanced political and commercial importance by the completion of the Baghdad Railway. A. SULTANATE OF KOWEIT A eea This principality is bounded on the E. by the Persian Gulf, and on the N. by Turkish territory, the frontier running from Umm Qasr to Safwan and thence past Jebel Sanam to the Batin. The W. boundary follows the Batin to Hafar, where it turns SE., along the line between Summan and Dahanah to the point where it is cut by the route from Koweit town to Riyadh by way of Wabrah. It here turns NE. to the NW. corner of the Hasa tract of Radait, whence it runs E. to the coast near Jebel Manifah. Its maximum length is about 190 miles, and its maximum breadth about 30 miles less. For the extent to which the Sultan's authority is disputed on its inland boundaries, see p. 39. P hysical C haracter The soil to N. of Koweit Bay is gravelly; in the S. it is part sand and part clay, but everywhere it is sterile and devoid of strikingPHYSICAL CHARACTER 285 features other than the isolated hills or ridges which break the surface and serve as landmarks. Such hills are 35 miles S. of Koweit town, and the hills of miles to the W. of it; the long, low ridge of Musanndh, running NE. by SW. between Dibdibah (see p. 292) and the Batin E. of Hafar, also deserves mention. There is no running water in Koweit territory with the exception of the stream of Maqta', flowing from the salt spring of 1 Ain el-'Abd into the sea at the boundary between the tracts of Sudah and Hazeim. Wells as a rule are some 20 ft. deep, and the water is often brackish ; they are scarce N. of Jahrah and in the SW. part of the territory toward the desert, Summan being practically waterless ; the more important wells are mentioned below under the districts in which they are situated. Vegetation is scanty. The chief trees are the date-palm and the or (a species of acacia). Various bushes provide fuel and grazing for camels. Wild animals are scarce, but the wolf, gazelle, and hare are found, the latter in Dibdibah and Summan. Among birds, the lesser bustard and the sand-grouse may be mentioned, the latter plentiful in the Batin in winter. Climate The climate of Koweit town is often cool when the NW. wind, the Shamdl, is blowing ; the summer heat is tempered by sea-breezes, and the neighbouring desert cools quickly at night. The average maximum temperature in the five years 1909-13 was 114° E., and the minimum 35°, though in 1911 the thermometer fell to 24-7° F. in January. The hotter months are from April to November, the cooler from December to March. The average rainfall for the same period was 4-796 in., though in 1909 it was as low as 2*42 in. and in 1911 as high as 6-47 in. For the interior there are no regular statistics. Temperatures recorded by Raunkiaer between Koweit and Safah in February and March 1912 show a maximum at mid day of 77° F. and an average of rather over 50° F. at 9 p.m. or 7 a.m., the thermometer falling even lower on the morning of February 25. Both the above traveller and Shakespear were more than once delayed by heavy showers of rain, and it may perhaps be assumed that the rainfall in the Batin and in Summan is not inferior to that of the littoral. It may be noted that good winter rains, by ensuring abundant pasture in spring, increase the range and fre quency of Bedouin raids.286 SULTANATE OF KOWEIT Population The settled population of the Sultanate is estimated at about 37,000, all but a couple of thousandbeing resident in Koweit town (see p. 295 f.); such figures illustrate the general barrenness of a territory extending over more than 20,000 square miles, with few settlements beyond the capital. The chief tribes contributing to an estimated nomadic population of some 13,000 are the Hawazin andRasha'idah. A few bands of Sulubba enter Koweit territory, and the Dhafir and Muteir camp in parts of it at certain seasons, the latter principally on the Summan tract, 'Ajman, Ha jar, and Beni Khalid are also represented. The Bedouins visit Koweit to make purchases in the market and to dispose of inland products, such as live stock and and they have a regular camping-ground outside Jahrah. Products and Trade Agriculture is almost entirely confined to the village of Jahrah, the produce of which is described below (p. 2961). The most ex tensive industries are fishing and pearl-fishing. The harbour fisheries are valuable ; the chief fish is the caught by long nets set across the tideway; other fish are taken in tidal weirs (hadhrahs) made of reed hurdles like those used at Bahrein. The pearl-fisheries employ more than 9,000 men, with 461 boats, in Koweit town, and smaller numbers in\ maritime villages of the E. coast; a series of good years from 1909 to 1912 were followed by a bad season in 1913. The only considerable manufacture is boat-building, for which the timber and fibre are chiefly brought from India. In 1912-13, 120 pearl-boats were built, with an approximate value of £27,000. . The more important part of the Koweit trade is borne in steam ships, but much is carried by the native sea-going boats whieh usually confine their operations to the region between Basra in the N. and Qatif in the S. These vessels are (' buggalows), with a capacity of 2,000 date packages, and and with a capacity of 1,200. Smaller used in coasting, hold about half the latter quantity. In 1913-14, 63 steamships (all but one British) of 121,482 tonnage, entered the port, and 36, with a tonnage of 65,097, cleared i ■ In the same year 668 sailing vessels entered, with a tonnage o 8,355. The total trade amounted to £570,558, of which £370,oi represented imported goods. India claims far the greatest snare of this traffic, about 60 % of the imports, and an even nignePRODUCTS AND TRADE 287 percentage of the exports. Next come the other countries round the Gulf, Turkish 'Iraq, Persia, and the Arabian Coast, collectively responsible in three years between 1911 and 1914, for 19-24% of exports, and 25-27% of imports. Hardly anything is sent to Europe from Koweit, all the exports going to India and the Gulf ; of imports during the same period the United Kingdom claimed rather less than 6 %,Germany and the United States about 2 % each. The chief imports, with their average values in thousands of pounds sterling, were, for the same three years : Piece-goods (chiefly from India and the United Kingdom), 77 ; rice (India), 57 ; specie, 53 ; sugar (Germany, Austria, India), 20 ; coffee (chiefly India), 17; tea (India), 7; coir (India), 5; enamelled ware (Austria), 4 ; kerosene (United States), 3 ; arms and ammunition (Prance), 3 ; all the above are brought in steamers. The following come in native boats ; tobacco (Turkish Arabia), 13 ; barley (Persia), 11|; water (Shatt el-'Arab), 10|; dates (Arabia), 7; timber (India), 5 ; rice (India and Turkish Arabia), 3A ; piece- goods (Persia), 1|. Exports by steamer are : pearls (to India), 46| ; specie (India, &amp;c.), 301; gM (from Nejd and Jebel Shammar to Bahrein and Persia), 2 ; horses and live stock (India and Bahrein), 1|. By native craft the only considerable exports are gki (to Bah rein), 4|; tea (Persia and Turkish Arabia), 3-|; rice, 3 ; timber (Turkish Arabia), 1|; sheepskins (Russia), 1^; sugar (Persia), 1. Other articles average less than £1,000 in value. The adminis tration of the customs is entrusted by the Sheikh to an Arab director, a native of Koweit, whose management is stated to be fairly efficient. New sheds have been erected, and hand-power cranes are said to have been ordered. The maritime trade of Koweit would derive great advantage from the establishment of a post office; it was hoped that this improvement might be effected in 1914. It is clear that the future destiny of the port largely depends on its choice or rejection as the terminus of the Baghdad Railway. A certain proportion of the Koweit imports goes inland by caravan to Nejd and Jebel Shammar. During the recent disturb ances in Central Arabia, much of the interior trade was diverted to Basra and Nejef. But the truce between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Sa'ud was favourable to the resumption of desert traffic; and rom 1912 and 1913 caravans are reported to have been coming and going regularly to and from Boreidah and Aneizah. The ollowing rates obtained in 1913-14 for camel-transport: Goods tor Boreidah and Aneizah or Zilfi, 4| riyals (9s.) per maund (121J lb.);288 SULTANATE OF KOWEIT goods for Shaqrah, Mejma' and Riyadh, 5 riyals (10s,) per maund (121| lb.) ; goods for Ha'il, 7 riyals (145.) per maund (121| lb). The rates for cases of tea, haberdashery, &amp;c., were 50 % higher. Transactions are now generally carried on in Indian rupees, but for some commodities the merchants retain the old Maria Theresa dollar or riydl ; the Bedouins also, conservative in matters of ex change, prefer payment in the dollar, and the coin is thus necessary for the purchase of camels or other live-stock of which the nomadic Arabs dispose. A few years ago Sheikh Mubarak, father of the present Sultan, introduced the nickel 1-anna piece, which imme diately proved popular as small change. In 1910 he fixed the value of the riydl at 85 Indian pice, the equivalent of $100 being Rs. 132.8125; in 1909 he had decreed that the exchange for the rupee should not fall below 64 pice. During the twelve months from April 1913 to March 1914 the exchange value of 100 riyals fluctuated between £9 13s. kd.,at the beginning of the period, to £10 6s. in September, closing at £9 18s. The Turkish was exchanged at an average rate of 18s. Currency Weights and Measures a.

Recent History and Present Politics The Sheikh of Koweit is now a mediatized ruler under British protection, with the title of Sultan ; the history of his principality has been summarized above (pp. 38 f.), but a few further details with regard to his government may be conveniently added here. The Sheikh's rule is personal and autocratic, avoiding delegation of authority to relatives or others likely to intrigue against him ; in the past the heads of departments have been mostly chosen from among slaves. In Koweit town it has been the usage for the ruler to give audience for an hour or two each morning in the market place, and to decide cases by a direct judgement. Within the limits of the town his authority is strictly enforced, but in country dis tricts, where control is difficult, it is necessarily more tolerant. The Bedouins are influenced by friendly treatment and by gifts ; Mubarak married into the tribe of the Muteir. But here, as elsewhere, the allegiance of the nomads is best ensured by their dependence upon a town for so many objects indispensable to their daily life (see p. 23). Beyond the few men acting as bodyguard and town guard, the Sheikh maintains the small posts to which some reference has been already made (p. 39). One of these was kept permanently by Mubarak in the desert near the Hasa frontier. At need, a levy can be raised from the tribes subject to Koweit influence. In 1910 a considerable force was sent against the Muntefiq with unfortunate ARABIA l m290 SULTANATE OF KOWEIT results, and the Sheikh was obliged to keep a strong body of men in the desert for months, at great cost to the people of Koweit. The present ruler is Sultan Salim ibn Mubarak ibn Sobah el- Khalifah, who succeeded his brother Jabir on February 5 1917 Mubarak was a strong ruler, under whom Koweit was the most peaceful and best-governed principality on the Gulf. He acted con sistently in accord with the British; and though by the Anglo -Turkish Convention of 1913 he acknowledged the suzerainty of the Sultan a practical autonomy was conceded to him, and the validity of all his agreements with H.M. Government was admitted by the Porte. On the outbreak of the war, all relations with the Ottoman Govern ment were broken off. Mubarak had a friendship of long standing with the family of the Emir of Riyadh, and was visited by Ibn Sa'ud, to whom, on more than one occasion, he had rendered useful service; on the other hand, his relations with Ibn Rashid were intermittently hostile. As regards the Bedouin tribes, Koweit has a standing feud with the Muntefiq, with whom are usually associated the Dhafir, and some times the 'Alwi section of the Muteir. Though the 'Ajman to some extent acknowledge the authority of the Sheikhs of Koweit, they sometimes attempt to raid their people, as near Jahrah in 1909, and at Wafrah in 1910. Mubarak held little communication with his distant relative the Sheikh of Bahrein, but was on terms of intimacy with Sheikh Khazal of Mohammarah. In the course of his reign he had acquired considerable estates at Fao on the Shatt el-'Arab. D istricts , I slands, and T owns Districts These may be conveniently divided into four groups, the first comprising allN. of a line running W. from Koweit town to the Batin; the second, all to the S. of this; the third, certain tracts of the far interior ; the fourth, the islands. The following are the northern districts : i. Bdtin, in the N. angle towards the Turkish frontier, named from the section of the great valley which it adjoins, ii. Shiqqaq, a barren tract E. of the preceding ; it is said to take its name from a number of shiqqahs or depressions. iii. Bdtih, E. of Shiqqaq and S. of the Turkish outpost of Safwan. An undulating waterless desert, 130-210 ft. above sea-level, tra versed by a broad shallow depression, Bil Jirfan, iv. Yah, a barren tract between Jahrah and Batih, 250 ft. aboveDISTRICTS 291 sea-level, traversed from E. to W. by the ridge Jal el-Yah, 50 ft. high and half a mile broad, covered with round stones. v. Qira 1 el-Marru, N. of Jahrah, the name signifying barren pebbly waste. It is a strip 6 miles broad, at an elevation of 250- 300 ft., waterless, but with some camel-grazing. vi. Zaqlah, a small tract between Jahrah and Qira' el-Marru. It is a basin draining to a central hollow, with grazing for camels. vii. Zor, on the N. side of Koweit Bay. Chiefly a range of hills running NE. and SW., passing 3 miles NW. of Jahrah. A small valley, Jauf el-Mutla', drains into the plain, 1-5 miles broad, called 8lf ('the beach'), between the range and the bay. This plain is barren and stony, though muddy in parts, and contains numerous wells. Near the E. end of the range are the wells of Mugheirah. Of the southern districts Umm is a generic term for the following coastal and adjoining tracts : Kabd, Qra ah, Adan, Salu , Hazeim, and perhaps the N. part of Sudah. It should, however, be noted that the term is by some confined to a small district W. of Hazeim, and here included in that tract. i. Qrd'ah, a barren sandy tract between Kabd and the Persian Gulf, and S. of Koweit Bay: it contains the town of Koweit. Among wells in the tract, in addition to Malcih (see Route No. 10), are 1 AdBiliyah, 3 miles S. of Koweit, a Bedouin camping-ground with 100 wells ; and two wells on or near the coast. Keif (in, on the E. side of Mas Ardh, about | mile from the point, and Qaleislyah, 10 miles SE. of Koweit and 1| miles from the coast, with 6 wells with good water at 27 ft. The Sheikh of Koweit's private water-supply is obtained from two wells four miles from Koweit (see p. 296). The wells of Jadddlydh and Suleibiycih are by some included in this tract. ii. 'Addn, immediately S. of the preceding, a ridge-like plain of softish sand running S. for 22 miles to the hill of Qreyyin, and 10-20 miles in width. The population consists chiefly of wandering Arabs, camping about the wells, but the following coast villages deserve notice: 1. Faneitis, 8 miles S. of Ras el-Ardh ; 6 or 7 wells. 2. Fantds, 16 miles from Koweit; 100 houses, mixed Arab popula tion ; cultivation of barley, fruits, and vegetables ; 300 date-palms ; about 30 wells, worked by donkey-power, with water at 20 ft. 3. Abu Haleifah, 18 miles from Koweit; 50 houses with mixed population; date-grove; cultivation of barley, fruits, and vege tables ; about 30 wells, good water at 20 ft. 4. miles from Koweit; 50 houses, mixed Arab population; some live stock ; about 20 wells with good water at 18 ft. 5. about 24 miles from Koweit; 15 houses within a ruinous fort; 10 wells with good water at 16 ft. ; a few pearl-boats. T 2292 SULTANATE OF KOWEIT Among wells in this tract the following may be noted: Tawll and War ah (see Routes Nos. 10 and i2). 25 miles S by E. of Koweit and 8 miles W. of Shi'aibah, with about 50 wells yield ing good water at 20 ft. Mazdra\ 3 miles to NW. of Laqit; 8 good wells with water at 18 ft. Safdwi, in the same region; 100 wells with water at the same depth. Um 1 mile W. of Laqit; about 80 wells, good water at 18 ft. 32 miles S. of Koweit and 20 miles from the coast; about 100 wells scattered in a plain of about 1 mile square, water at about 18 ft.; no grazing quite near. Manlfah, on the coast, between the village of Fantas and Haneidhil; 9 wells, good water at 21 ft. Aqailah, several miles S. of Shi'aibah village, and Areifjdn, 1 mile N. of the same. 2 miles N. of the village of Fantas. iii. Salu', S. of 'Adan, extending for 30 miles N. and S., and about 20 miles broad ; a sterile tract of loose dark sand. iv. Hazeim, S. of Salu', a plain of firm dark soil, with no vegeta tion beyond camel grazing. In the S. is the briny rivulet of Maqta'. Wells in the tract are ; Wafrah, 50-60 miles due S. of Koweit and 25 miles inland, with drinkable water at 12 ft. ; about 10 miles WSW. of the mouth of M rivulet, with fair water at 12 ft. ; 'Aseildn, about 4 miles W. and rather N. of the preceding; and 'Atdridh, not far from 'Aseilan in the same direction. v. Sudah, S. of Hazeim, extending for about 60 miles to the N. borders of Hasa, and bounded on the W. by the Dhula' el-Mi £ aijil range and the Na'airlyah hill. It is a level tract of firm dark sand, including in its N. part the Labibah plain. The chief wells are Hamudh and Naqair or Inqair, with water at a depth of about 12 ft. The districts of the interior are the following : i. Kabd, 25 miles SW. of Koweit, W. of 'Adan ; a belt of high ground running E. to W., but of no great extent. ii. Shaqq, a shallow valley, perhaps 80 miles long from N. to S., and on the average about 10 miles broad, between Umm Janeib on the E. and Dibdibah on the W. It ends on the N. about 20 miles NW. of Jahrah, and is bounded on the S. by Dhula' el-Mi'aijil. It is uninhabited, but yields most of the grass and firewood sold in the town of Koweit. Where it is crossed by the route from Koweit to RiqaH it contains a Miabrah (rain-pool) called Fardq ; another pool, Khabrat ed-Dawlsh, lies on the route from Koweit to Hafar (see Route No. 10). iii. Dibdibah. A large district W. of Shaqq, with the Batin on the NW. and Summan on the SW., its N. end lying about 25 miles W. of Jahrah ; it has a length of about 100 miles, while its breadth may amount to 50 miles. It consists of featureless, slightly undu-DISTRICTS 293 lating plains of steppe-desert, the depressions concealing camels at comparatively short distances. It is without wells, though it has several rain-pools {Ummel-'Amdrah, Umm el-Hmmr), and there is pasture in spring. Raunkiaer, crossing it from Koweit to Zilfi, notes that it produces truffles, and that it is frequented by hares and gazelles. The Musannah ridge, running ENE. from the neighbourhood of Hafar, is a distinguishing feature of Dibdibah. iv. El-Bdtin. The most northerly section of the great Wadi Rummah, which begins in the Harrat Kheibar, towards the W. side of Arabia. The part which borders or enters Koweit territory begins about Hafar, running NE. in an almost straight line for more than 150 miles to lose itself in the low country of Turkish Traq. The Batin is generally a well-marked depression varying in breadth from 8 miles at Hafar to 2 miles at Riqa'i. The actual bottom, which is 3 miles at Hafar, is ordinarily much narrower, and in places contracts to J mile; it is covered with a level deposit of dark- coloured clay, apparently washed down from the higher ground. There are often large patches of scrub which give cover to gazelle and bustard, while the sand-grouse is found in winter. Routes from Basra and Koweit to Qasim in Nejd run along the Batin (see Routes Nos. 8 and 9), which should not be confused with the smaller tract mentioned above (p. 290), to which it lends its name. v. Summdn, a vast tract of which the N. part alone, between Dibdibah and the Dahanah desert, belongs to the territory of Koweit. The Sultan's portion is about 120 miles in length, with a maximum breadth of about 90 miles ; beyond his territory, towards the SE., the tract narrows to about 20 miles, where it is crossed by the Riyadh-Hofuf route (see Route No. 11). Summan, which may be regarded as a southerly continuation of the stony Hajarah desert, appears to be largely composed of sandstone, which forms hills, and crops out in different parts, though Shakespear, entering it farther S. from the Wadi el-Miyah district of Hasa, speaks of limestone rocks. On the E. side it begins with a confusion of small valleys winding among flat-topped hills, and brightened here and there in spring by wild flowers, grass, and shrubs. In or near this zone lie Hafar, Sdfah, and Wabrah, important wells, forming stages on the various roads from Koweit to Nejd (see Routes Nos. 9 and 10). Farther on the tract becomes more open, the valleys grow broader and flatter, winding nearly N. and S., while the low hills are less irregularly disposed. There are parts which are almost flat, with here and there depressions clothed with scrub and grasses. As the W. border is approached, there is again a confusing labyrinth of valleys, passing into broken ground with patches of grass and294 SULTANATE OF KOWEIT brushwood. This is succeeded by undulating plains with outcrops of sandstone, which end abruptly at the edge of Dahanah. Though there are no wells in the interior of Summan, after good rains it provides excellent and extensive pasture. But if the later rains fail there may be a shortage of grazing as early as April, affecting the movements of the tribes, the chief of which, in the Koweit Summan, is the Muteir. Islands 1. Buhiydn in the NW. corner of the Gulf, just N. of Koweit Bay, is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit, on the ground that Hawazin from his territory fish in summer on its NE. coast. In 1902 the Turks established a storehouse, guarded by a detachment under an officer, near Ras d-Qaid on the SE. corner. There are no villages on the island. 2. Feilakah (pronounced Feilachah) on the N. side to the entrance to Koweit Bay, is 7 miles in length with a maximum breadth of 3 miles, and is very low. The only village is on the NW. coast, though there are several deserted settlements ; the only other in habited place is Qreiniyah, where the Sheikh has a residence. The people of Zor are of mixed origin, mostly fishermen, with a few pearl- divers, and owning about 100 boats. Water is found in most parts of the island at a depth of about 6 ft. : in the interior and during the hot weather it is apt to be brackish. Wheat and barley are cultivated, with an annual yield of about 30 tons ; there is some cultivation of melons, lucerne, and vegetables. There are a few camels, a number of donkeys, and some cattle on the island. Feilakah is governed on behalf of the Sheikh by one of his relations. It possesses numerous tombs of Mohammedan saints to which pilgrims resort: the Muqam el-Khidhar, overlooking the boat-harbour of Zor, and now a roofless tower, is a shrine frequented by Arab sailors. 3. Kubbar, in 29° 4' Lat. N. and 48° 30' Long. E., about 20 miles off the coast; an uninhabited islet. 4. Qdru, 28° 49' Lat. N., 48° 47' Long. E., 25 miles from the coast, and 24 miles SE. of Kubbar, likewise uninhabited. 5. Umm el-Marddim, 28 miles S. by E. of Kubbar, and 16 miles from the coast, also without inhabitants. 6. Qurein or Qrein (frequently pronounced Grain), another islet close to the shore 4 miles to W. of Koweit, with a good anchorage for boats in the basin called Bandar esh-Shuweikh, on the SE. side, was used as a quarantine station in 1912, but abandoned in the following year on account of difficulties with regard to supplies ana water. Grane, or Graine, the old English name for Koweit, was probably taken from this island.TOWNS 295 Towns 1. Koweit, capital of the Sultanate, is situated on the S. coast of the bay of the same name, about 80 miles S. by E. of Basra and 280 miles NNW. of Bahrein. It extends for about 2 miles along the shore, with a depth varying between J mile and f mile. On the land side, the desert tract of Qra'ah (see p. 291) comes right up to the houses, and there are no date-groves nor cultivated lands. The site is in general flat and sandy, but rises towards the SW.; just beyond the town on the S. and E. the soil is clay, and here material is dug for the mud walls of the ordinary houses. Koweit has no regular plan ; most of the streets are winding, and cross each other at irregular intervals. The principal thoroughfare runs from the sea to the bazaar and market-place at the back of the town. It begins with two branches, one starting near the custom house, to the W. of the Sheikh's palace about the middle of the sea-front, the other some little distance to the E. of it, this latter branch containing the offices of the British India Steam Navigation Co. and the American Mission. The branches unite almost S. of the palace, and proceed directly to the market, passing the largest mosque in the town on the right hand. The bazaar forms a labyrinth of narrow streets about the N. end of the market-place, which has been compared to a bay running into the town straight out of the desert; it is in fact continuous with the waste country, and the caravans, which are loaded at the S. end, are on the desert from the very start. The bazaar is without architectural interest, and is not covered by the vaulted roofs which lend attraction to those in some other places; its chief protection from the sun is sup plied by awnings of mat and palm-branch. The merchants of textile fabrics trade in the main thoroughfare, at the end of which are the chief tobacconist's shop and the Bible warehouse of the American Mission. Household utensils are sold at the head of the market place ; on the E; side are shops for travellers' requisites, such as saddles, arms, sandals, and coffee-pots. At the top of the market place are the pavilion-like structures, with a single many-windowed upper floor approached by an outside staircase, in which the Sheikh sits during his daily audiences (see p. 289). There are coffee-houses in both bazaar and market, where coffee and tea are served. The residence of the British Political Agent is on the front, to the E. of the Sheikh's palace. The latter is a rambling complex of different styles and dates, in the architecture of which can be traced the influence of Persia and Mesopotamia. It has three main divisions, the Sheikh's private residence and harem, a fort-like296 SULTANATE OF KOWEIT structure surrounding a court; a central mass of irregular buildings • and the serai, built by an architect of Baghdad, with high reception halls surrounded by corridors with great open arcades. The better houses of Koweit are of plastered stone, but the great maioritv have mud walls, and are of only one storey, with a parapet round the flat roof ; they are usually built about interior courts. The mosques, of which there are about 30, are of plain appearance with low rectangular minarets ; the chief mosque has a large portal on the N. side not without some pretence to dignity. As eastern cities go, Koweit is a well-kept place, though some parts suffer from uncleared refuse, and it is badly off for water. In 1914 it was decided to establish a condensing-apparatus, an alternative scheme for boring artesian wells having been rejected. The town has hitherto depended on supplies brought by sailing-boats from the Shatt el-'Arab (see p. 286), but great inconvenience resulted whenever these boats were weather-bound. Drinking-water is also obtained from wells 4 miles away, and the Sheikh's private supply is carried from the wells of Qasres-Sirrah and Mishrlf in the tract of Qra'ah. It has been already stated that almost the whole population of the principality is concentrated in the town (see p. 286). The great majority of the inhabitants are Arabs, but there are about 1,000 Persians, and some 200 Jews, while negroes, slaves and free, number some 4,000. Nearly all the people are Sunnis, but the Mecca Pilgrimage, now made only by sea, is said not to attract more than 50 persons in the year. The Arabs of Koweit are not of a robust type, but usually of slender build and sickly complexion. The men wear the ordinary dress of the sedentary Arab with a of red and white, the women black veils and mantles, with a bright-coloured skirt sometimes displayed beneath. A curious feature of life in the town is the emergence after sunset of innumer able beggars, mostly children, who besiege the houses for morsels of the evening meal, and are seldom sent away empty. The chief occupations are maritime (p. 286) ; there is no agri culture nor cultivation, all vegetables and similar produce coming from Jahrah. Retail traders comprise dealers in Bedouin require ments, leather-workers, haberdashers, tailors, goldsmiths, tinsmiths, date-merchants, grocers, and druggists. 2. Jahrah, a large and important village of town rank near the foot of Koweit Bay, 20 miles by road W. of Koweit. It is the chief, and almost the only seat of agriculture in Koweit territory, and caravans to Basra, and Boreidah via Hafar, pass through it. The permanent inhabitants are chiefly cultivators of Nejdi extraction,TOWNS 297 numbering more than 500, but this total is increased in the hot weather by about 700 households, mostly of the Muteir tribe, encamping on the plain of Mareitabah on the N., where there are numerous wells. The place is dry, and has a healthy climate. The Sheikh of Koweit has a fortified residence on the SE. side, outside the limits of cultivation, with walls some 200 ft. in length and 15 ft. high, and a tower 20 ft. high at each corner. The entrance, on the NW. side, is commanded from within by an old muzzle- loading gun ; the enclosure contains stabling for about 100 horses, and the Sheikh's brood mares are kept there. Jahrah is com manded at artillery ranges from the Zor hills on the N. The water at the foot of the bay is too shallow to allow warships to stand in close. The people are occupied in tilling the irrigated lands owned by the Sheikh, and by merchants of Koweit and relatives of the Neqib of Basra. The chief crops are wheat, barley, lucerne, dates, melons, pumpkins, beans, and other vegetables. Though some wheat is grown by rainfall, most of the above crops are produced in walled enclosures irrigated by channels ; the water is raised from wells by water-lifts {arjlydh) worked by donkeys ; there are more than a dozen date-groves. Agricultural implements are few and simple, consisting of a rudimentary plough an iron spade (fakhin), used to make and repair water-channels or to open and close them, and a wooden rake or hoe for levelling the ground. Jahrah is governed by an Emir on behalf of the Sultan of Koweit. It is regarded as a valuable possession, not only on account of its produce, but because its popularity with the Bedouins enables the Sheikh to maintain and extend his influence among the tribes. B. HASA Area This region runs along the W. coast of the Persian Gulf from the S. frontier of the Sultanate of Koweit to that of El-Qatar and the desert of Jdfurah, a distance of about 300 miles ; on the W. it is bounded by Summan. It has an average breadth of about 50 miles and has been divided into a number of natural tracts, the boundaries of which are often indeterminate and without administrative significance (see below).298 HASA Physical Character The greater part of Hasa consists of steppe and desert land rising westward from a low coast, along which the country is of type. The surface is broken by a number of isolated hills which serve as landmarks ; continuous high ground is found chiefly in the interior to the W. of the region; such is the line of hills along the Wadi el-Miyah (see p. 309), and the Jebel et-Taff to the S.; the stony ridges of Summan, running more or less parallel with the coast of the Gulf, intervene between Hasa and the belt of Dahanali which separates it from Nejd. Apart from the Wadi el-Miyah the principal valley is the great Wadi Faruq in the SW. Saline de pressions (sibdkh) occur in the tracts on or near the coast. Shallow wells of drinkable water are numerous, and there is a fair quantity of grazing; the desert parts of the region are thus habitable by Bedouins. But the richest districts are the two oases of Hasa and Qatif in the S., where water is abundant, and there are not only wells, but springs, streams, and lake-like ponds, the whole repre senting the subterranean drainage of inner Arabia, which passes the Dahanah underground. (See also under Bahrein.) Climate The climate of the lower and eastern part of Hasa is of the character usual to tihdmah plains, but the moisture is increased in the oasis tracts by the amount of surface water used in irrigation. Here the great heat common to the whole region is doubly oppressive in the hot season, more especially in Qatif; as the coastal plain is left behind, the healthier desert conditions begin to obtain. Statis tics are not available for Hasa, as for Koweit and Bahrein, but it is probable that the variations of temperature lie somewhere between those quoted for these two principalities, the climate being less subject to extremes than that of the former, and perhaps rather less equable than that of the archipelago. The average maximum temperature would then be about 110° F., and the average minimum rather above 40° F., the hottest weather occurring in July and August, with heat increasing from April and decreasing from September, the cool season falling between November and March. The average rainfall should be about 4 in., almost the whole being confined to the cooler season and to comparatively few wet days.POPULATION 2S9 P opulation The settled population is estimated at about 100,000; the nomadic at about 57,000 ; the chief distinctions among the former are not tribal but religious, the people falling into two main groups of Sunni and Shiah. If speaking Arabic as the mother tongue, the sedentary Shiah are known as Bahdrinah ; they form almost the whole population of the Qatif oasis, and nearly half that of the oasis of Hasa, occupying in addition the island of Tarut. Many Arabs of the nomadic tribes have become sedentary ; some 4,500 of the Beni Khalid live on the islands of Musallamiyah, Jinnah, and Tarut, at Qasr es-Subeih, at Kalabiyah and Jishshah in Hasa oasis, and at Umm es-Sahak in the oasis of Qatif. In the Wadi el-Miyah there are about 1,000 miscellaneous Arabs, and smaller numbers in other places. Negro slaves are numerous in the culti vated area. Among the Bedouins, tribal distinctions are paramount, bome 35,000 of the 'Ajman tribe make their head-quarters in Hasa ; the Ahl Murrah, though chiefly ranging the Jafurah desert and Jabrin, are represented by 7,000 members ; the Beni Khahd by 10,000, and the Beni Hajar by 5,000 souls. Nomads of the Hawazm, Rasha'idah, Dawasir, Sahul, Muteir, Sebei', Ateibah, and Qahtan make temporary sojourns within the boundaries of Hasa, though more properly belonging to Koweit and Nejd. The Beni Khalid range chiefly in the N. of the region, the Ahl Murrah in the S., the intervening space towards the interior is regarded as the territory of the 'Ajman, that towards the coast, of the Hajar. Previous to the expulsion of the Turks from Hasa, in 1913,^ these tribes, with the Manasir, continually raided the routes from 'Oqair to Hofuf and Hofuf to Riyadh ; the state of the former route was indeed one of chronic insecurity. In 1912 Raunkiaer found great difficulty in traversing the Riyadh— Hofuf route, and, in spite of ibn Sa'ud's protection, he encountered considerable hostility and was threatened more than once. But the victory of Ibn Sa ud has put an end for the present to such attacks, as his power is now respected by the Bedouins. The 'Ajman formerly did not confine themselves to land raids, but even engaged in piracy. In 1912 members of the tribe on board a ship sailing from Bahrein to Qatif over mastered the crew and ran the vessel ashore, making off with the cargo. At that time they were said to intend establishing a post on the coast, whence to strike at the traffic between the above places. But Ibn Sa'ud put an end to their raiding. In the summer of 1915 he practically expelled them from Hasa into Koweit territory,300 HASA whence they were requested by the Sultan to withdraw n seem to have pushed northwards into Muntefiq and DhafTr +* • tones, for the time at any rate erri ' Domestic Life and Appliances While the life of the Bedouins and of the poorer villagers in the territory of Hasa resembles that of similar classes in othlr parts „ Arabia that of the merehants of Hofuf and Qatif is normK tingmshed by a vanety and amplitude which contrast with the simplicity of the interior. Raunkiaer, however, found great in security m Hofuf itself, and he says there was no security at alUn the oasis in 1912 ; though conditions appear to have improved ' some degree since Ibn Sa ud's intervention. The position of Hasa as a maritime and commercial province, with ports linking it to India, Persia and 'Iraq explains the foreign influences formerly apparent to the eye and the tendency to a more luxurious mode of living Palgrave noted the refinement lent to domestic architec ture by the free use of the arch, and the structural superiority thus attamed over the more monotonous and heavier buildings of Neid and Shammar. He further remarked the exterior use of a fine white plaster and the ornament bestowed on doorways and windows. But it should be added that Lorimer describes the houses in the Hasa oasis as of sun-dried bricks and mud. Houses have upper storeys, sometimes more than one, with the usual flat roof ; each has its secluded court, and generally its private well. In the dwellings o the well-to-do may be seen wood-carving on door and window frames and painted walls ; in the house of a merchant of Qatif who en er ained mm Palgrave saw a profusion of carpets and ornaments e okenmg a Persian rather than an Arab taste. In Hofuf domestic furniture is more varied than in Nejd; the stools, low tables, cupboards, and bedsteads recall those used in Western India. A greater variety also marks the dress of the people. In Hofuf an he surrounding villages the wide white Arab shirt is often rep aced by the closer-fitting saffron-dyed and silk-embroidered ves^ o Uman. The usual kaflydh is sometimes superseded by the urban, and a light red cloak may relieve the sombre hue of the Arab mantle; Hasa is the home of finely woven cloaks with delicately embroidered borders. Red leather sandals of more P e SLl P erse de the brownish yellow footgear of the interior, and the curved dagger of Oman, with silver-mounted hilt, may be worn a ■ the side. In short, the life of the townsmen in Hofuf, Mubarraz, and Qatif is larger and more liberal on its materialDOMESTIC LIFE AND APPLIANCES 301 side than that of Nejd ; Palgrave claims for it an equal superiority in the intellectual sphere and in the amenities of social intercourse. The houses of the cultivators and fishermen, and the implements which they employ, differ less from those of other parts of Arabia ; huts are commonly of mud or palm-fronds. Ploughing is done by oxen or by asses, the former being of the humped variety, like those employed in India for the same purpose. P roducts and T rade The pearl-fisheries on the coast of Hasa occupy more than 160 boats and employ 3,500 men, but the chief industry is the culti vation of the well-irrigated oases. Dates are the chief product, the best being among the finest in the world ; but rice, wheat, barley, vegetables, and fruits are also raised. Cattle are abundant in the planted area, sheep less numerous than in Nejd ; donkeys number many thousands, about a quarter being of the famous white Hasa breed. Horses are rare ; but both riding- and baggage-camels are easily obtained. Manufactures are few and chiefly confined to Hofuf, where there is some textile industry, producing fine abbas of wool, silk and wool, or silk and cotton, enriched with embroidery of fine design and borders of gold thread. The copper and brass coffee-pots of the same town are so well kn6wn as to form an export. The chief market is Hofuf, which, through the port of 'Oqair, serves not only the oasis and the nomad country depending upon it, but, in part also, the S. district of Nejd. There is a weekly caravan from Riyadh bringing ghi to Hofuf, and taking back cloth, sugar, and rice. The trade of Qatif with the interior is of less importance. The principal exports are dates, date-branches for fuel, reeds and mats, ghi, hides, abbas, donkeys, and pearls, mostly consigned to Bahrein, Basra, Persia, and Bombay ; imports are piece-goods, hardware, rice, coffee, wheat, barley, .sugar, and spices, chiefly from the same places. Manamahin Bahrein, the great entrepot for foreign goods on the W. coast of the Gulf, is of cardinal importance to the trade of Hasa. Many thousands of tons of dates are exported, though the greater part of the crop is locally consumed. Camels reared by the Dawasir, Murrah and Muteir are sold in Hasa for the Damascus market (see vol. ii, p. 18). A trade in negro slaves con tinued under Turkish rule. C urrency The popular standard of currency is the or Maria-Theresa dollar (worth about Is. 10|d), though Indian rupees are acceptedRECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 303 May 5th seized Hofuf without much fighting, and soon afterwards took Qatif. The Turkish garrison withdrew first to El-Qatar and finally sailed to Basra. Emirs were appointed by Ibn Sa'ud in Hofuf and Qatif, and at a meeting at 'Oqair with Capt. Shakespear, the British Political Agent from Koweit, the Emir announced that these officials were instructed to help and protect British subjects in consultation with the Agent. In June 1914 Ibn Sa'ud accepted the title of Vali of Nejd and Hasa from the Turks, but he continued to invite closer relations with the Indian Government, and on Capt. Shakespear's appointment as Political Officer in Nejd, later in the same year, he received the British representative with cordiality. On the outbreak of the European War, he opposed Ibn Rashid, who had espoused Turkish interests in Arabia, and fought a drawn battle with him at Mejma' in Sedeir, in March 1915; but in the summer of the same year a formal peace was concluded between the two Emirs. This, however, is merely nominal, and in 1916 a Nejd force was threatening Ibn Rashid from the south. Ibn Sa'ud can summon to his standard the Beni Khalid and Beni Hajar, and to his control over these tribes is due the improvement in the security of the Hasa province and the caravan routes by which it is approached. The hostility of the Bedouins to the Turks had been such that the sovereignty of the Sultan extended no farther than the effective power of the garrisons and military or police posts, while life and property were insecure even in the neighbourhood of Hofuf. Under the Porte, the whole region of Hasa, known as the Sanjak of Nejd, formed a division of the Basra vilayet. The capital was Hofuf, and the country was administered on the usual Turkish system, though the government approximated to the nature of a military occupation. Subsidies were paid to the 'Ajman, Beni Hajar, Beni Khalid, and Ahl Murrah tribes, who provided carriers of the official mails, and raflqs for their escort. The garrison, chiefly concen trated at Hofuf and Qatif, consisted of 4 battalions of infantry and 2 squadrons of cavalry, with 1 mule-battery, and a small auxiliary camel-corps of Arabs. In addition, there were 6 companies of police, 4 of which were mounted. The revenue was chiefly obtained from agriculture, more especially date cultivation, a tax being imposed on dates in Qatif, while in Hasa the Government took a share of the crops. The amount thus obtained was estimated at nearly £25,000; customs were farmed, and are said to have yielded as much again. There were no public posts nor telegraphs.304 HASA Districts These are for the most part not administrative but natural tracts the exact boundaries of which are difficult to determine ; with the exception of the two oases of Hasa and Qatif, few of them have any centres of population even approaching town rank. As the two oases are of predominant importance, it may be well to consider them first. 1. Hasa A district in parts of great fertility, bounded on the E. and N. by Biyadh, on the W. by Ghuwar, and on the S. by Kharmah; its natural boundaries are on the NW. Jebel Qarat er-Rukban, on the SW. Jebel Bu Ghanlmah, and on the S. a line drawn between the last-named mountain and Jebel Arba'. The oasis, which extends for about 30 miles N. and S. and 21 miles E. andW., is separated from the Gulf at 'Oqair by more than 30 miles of desert country. Only a part of it is cultivated and inhabited ; the remainder is for the most part barren. The mass of the fertile territory extends for about 12 miles to the E. of Hofuf and Mubarraz; but there are detached blocks of cultivation farther to the N., and round 'Ayun, The most remarkable physical feature of the Hasa Oasis is the abundance of water in the cultivated area, provided by a multitude of springs, all warm and some hot. So numerous are these springs, that in parts the whole country is saturated, and roads run on embankments ; marshes and stagnant ponds are not infrequent, and some sheets of water attain the dimensions of lakes. Such are Birkat el-Asfar, 12 miles ENE. of Hofuf, and BirkatUmm el-Mahza, 7 miles E. of 'Ayun. The plentiful supply of water admits of an elaborate irrigation-system which enables rice to be grown. The chief product is the date, but there are fields of wheat and barley; fruit includes limes, citrons, peaches, apricots, figs, pomegranates, and grapes, though little reaches a high quality. Natural grass is plentiful in spring. Most of the live stock already mentioned is found in the two oases. The chief villages not mentioned along the routes (see Routes Nos. 11, 12, and 13) are : 'Ayun, 20 miles N. of Hofuf, with 500 houses and a moat which can be filled ; 5 miles W. of Jishshah, small, but walled and bastioned, with springs and date- trees ; Hazam, near Mubarraz, a large Bedouin encampment in hot weather ; Bab el-J afar, a few miles SW. of Jishshah, a large walled village of 350 houses, formerly head-quarters of a Turkish ; Qasr esh-Sharqi (also called Qasr G 4 miles E, of aDISTRICTS 305 former Turkish fort; RuqaiqaJi, 1 mile S. of Hofuf, a large Bedouin permanent camp. The principal towns are: 1. Hofuf, the capital of the region, in the SE. corner of the cultivated area, 40 miles inland, with the desert close on the S. and cultivation round the other three sides. The town has three quarters: (I) Kut in the NW.; (2) Rifd'ah in the E.; (3) Na'dthil in the S. and W. Kut is a fortified enclosure with numerous towers, built by Ibrahim Pasha, 600 yards square and surrounded by a ditch ; it formed till 1913 the residence of the Turkish garrison and community. It contains a domed Sunni mosque, also built by Ibrahim, a military hospital, two forts, and a jail; the number of houses is 1,200. Rifa'ah, with 2,100 houses, is the highest and most healthy quarter, containing the homes of the wealthier classes. Na'athil, with 1,700 houses, is the poorer quarter, though it too has wealthy residents, and contains the largest Shiah mosque in Arabia. Kut has on its E. side the Suq with an arcade of shops, while on the S. it is separated from Na'athil by a grove of palms. It is enclosed by a wall 24 ft. high, with two gates; the wall sur rounding the rest of the town is 12 ft. high, with six gates, but no ditch. The houses of Hofuf are largely of stone, with gypsum mortar, and nearly all have their own wells, with water at a depth of about 25 ft. The streets, with one or two exceptions, are narrow and filthy. A detached fort, Qasrel-Khazdm, lies a few hundred yards from the W. of the town, by the Turkish cemetery ; to the SE. is a group of gardens with a large well, called Outside the N. of the town is the el -Khamls, where a market for Bedouins is held on Thursdays. The inhabitants, said to number 25,000, are described as of mixed Arab stock, with a few immigrants from Nejd. Three-quarters are Sunni; the remainder, with the exception of a few Wahabi, are Shiah. The special manufactures of Hofuf have been already mentioned ; for its trade with Riyadh and with the Gulf through 'Oqair, see above, p. 301. 2. Mubarraz lies 2 miles N. of Hofuf, with which it is connected by a raised causeway; it has the desert on the W., but cultivation on the other sides, and is surrounded by a dilapidated wall, with gates N. and S., but no ditch. Outside the wall on the W. is the fort Qasr Sahud, and beyond this the camping-ground, Hazam (see above, p. 304). The town contains five quarters, of which the largest, 'Ayuni, is in the centre and SW., containing the market, the per manent shops and the former residence of the Turkish Mudir. In the NW. quarter, Siydsib, resides the headman of the town. The number of houses, mostly of stone and lime, is estimated at ARABIA I tt306 HASA 1,670, with a population of 8,500. The business of the town is. agricultural, and there is a weekly market for Bedouins on Fridays. 2. Oasis Qatif This tract adjoins the coast; it is bounded on the N. and W. bv the desert country of Biyadh, on the S. by Barr edh-Dhahran. Its length from N. to S. is about 18 miles, with an average breadth of 3 miles, the town of Qatif lying in the middle. Its height is only a few feet above the sea, and most of its area consists of a sandy plain saturated by spring water, of normal temperature. The cultivated part of the tract ends 6 miles S. of the town, but, as in Hasa, there are detached blocks of cultivated ground; in the N., about Safwa and Umm es-Sahak, are reed-producing marshes. The atmosphere is denser than in Hasa, and the moist heat more oppressive ; the climate is thus damp and unhealthy, and there is much malarial fever. The settled population is said to be 26,000, nearly all Bahdrinah (see p. 299); a few non-nomadic Arabs (Beni Khalid) are found at Umm es-Sahak, and a few Huwalah in Qatif town. Agriculture forms the principal industry, and the yield of dates from the irrigated plantations is very large ; a high proportion of the crop is exported to Oman, Persia, Bahrein, and India. The following weights and measures are peculiar to Qatif: {a) For general 18 riyals 1 Qiyas = 1-07 lb. (sometimes = -| 102 mithqal shirazi, i or rather less). 1 Alf =2 qiyas (2-14 lb.). 1 Mann = 16 alf (34-37 lb.). 1 Qallah =2 mann (68-75 lb.).

The unit of linear measure is the of 19| in.DISTRICTS 807 The principal villages of the oasis are ; a hamlet on the coast, 4 miles SSE. of Qatif town, with a fort formerly garrisoned by a Turkish battalion, and date plantations owned by Beni Khalid ; 1 Awdmlyah, walled, with 300 houses, 3 miles NNW. of Qatif, and 1-2 miles inland, watered by excellent springs ; 4 miles S. of Qatif, and 3 miles from the sea, walled, with 250 houses, and three fine springs near a mosque outside the E. wall; 8 miles N. by W. of Qatif, walled, with 350 houses and the two copious springs of Ddrush, and 'Atlqa 1 mile to S. ; Ldjdm, walled, with good springs, in the centre of a cultivated area 6 miles WNw! of Qatif. Dammdm, on the coast, 9 miles SE. of Qatif, is now deserted, but has ruined houses and two ruined forts, one on the mainland, the other on a reef. The towns and port of Qatif are as follows : 1. Qatif, situated on the bay containing Island, 230 miles SE. by S. from Koweit, 64 miles N. by W. of 'Oqair, and 36 miles NW. by W. from the nearest part of Bahrein. A reef opposite the town extends 10 miles seawards ; upon this, 2 miles E. of the town, is an islet with a ruined fort, Burj on the N. side of which is a basin where three channels from the open sea converge ; from here a passage leads to the town, but boats of over 6 ft. draught cannot reach an inner berth. The town consists of the Kutor fortified quarter, outside which are a long bazaar and various suburbs. The Kut has bastioned walls 30 ft. high, with a frontage of 400 yds. towards the sea, where there is a gate, and a frontage of 300 yds. towards the W. and S., where there are also gates, the former opening upon the suburb Bdh esh-Shamdl, to which it gives its name ; to the N. is a dense forest of date-palms. The fort contains 700 houses, mostly of stone and gypsum-mortar, but no shops; the Turkish Government offices were in the extreme SE. corner. The bazaar runs a quarter of a mile S. from the SW. corner to the suburb of ; it is stone_built and roofed, with 300 shops. Other suburbs are Maddris, Mayyds,Dabeiblyah, and SharVah. The population of the town is computed to be 5,000, and that of the suburbs an equal number ; nearly all are There are no Oriental Christians, Jews, or Persians; the 70 Hindu traders, who were once settled here, withdrew after the Turkish occupation. But in June 1910 an Indian firm from Bahrein opened a shop and did most satisfactory trade, an example which has no doubt been folio wed 2. Seihat, on the coast, 2 miles SE. of 'Anik. A walled town of 600 houses with its own sheikh ; it has abundant water, and is occupied with agriculture. u 2308 HASA 3. 'Oftair (frequently pronounced 'Ojair), 64 miles S hv w Qatlf town and 24 miles WSW. of the S. end of BahmWand It lies on the SW. shore of a bay, with an entrance 200-300 varrk wide, and a channel of 3-4 fathoms. There is, strictly speaking no town of 'Oqair the place consisting of a fort and a large » close together The latter is an enclosure of 150 by 80 yards, surrounded by a wall 16 feet high, with sheds along three sides in the interior- it contains three shops, and all travellers to and from the nort take up their lodging within its walls. Under Turkish rule there were practically no inhabitants other than the detachment of soldiers in the fort, some police, the customs and port officers and a few agents representing merchants in the Hasa oasis. Water is obtained in the sandpits at Abu a short distance SW. of the fort, but that from the well of in the surrounding tract of Biyadh is of better quality. The^ port serves the Hasa oasis, and, to a great extent, S. Neid to which it imports rice, piece-goods, coffee, sugar, and hardware' chiefly coming through Bahrein. The neighbouring Arabs are Ahl Murrah, Ajman, and Beni Hajar. 3. Other Tracts i. Zor el-Audhdn, from Jebel Manifah to Musallamiyah Bay, and inland to the marshy depression of Sabkhat el-Mutaya. The tract, which is without settlements, has an extension on an average less than 20 miles. Its wells are poor : that of is on the coast half-way between Has el-Ghar and Has el-Museinah; that called Sudah is about 3 miles inland from the NW. side of Musalla miyah Bay. ii. Huzum, S. of the above, extending 25 miles to the foot of Dohat ed-Dafi; the wells of Mistannah (see Route No. 13) are on its W. boundary. The soil is sandy, bearing the tree, with shrubs and grasses. Wells average 6 ft. in depth. That named Nuqurlyah is in the base of the promontory point of Musallamiyah Bay ; that of Mutdya is 3 miles SW. of the foot of the same bay. There is no settled population, but the tract is frequented by the Beni Khalid and Ajman. iii. Biyddh, the largest of the Hasa tracts, S. of Huzum, extending about 130 miles from opposite Abu 'Ali Island to Ras es -Sufeirah opposite the S. end of Zakhnuniyah Island, with a maximum breadth of about 50 miles. The soil is sandy, with many low white sand-hills {naqiydn) ; grasses and scrub grow in profusion, and water is obtainable everywhere by digging a few feet beneath the surface.f S' DISTRICTS 309 In the N. of the tract are two broad saline depressions, Sabkhat es-Summ and Sabkhah Salaliyat, while a nitrous and marshy depression, Sabkhah Shatar, lies close to the E. border of the Hasa oasis, and is crossed by the route from 'Oqair to Hofuf. The best watered regions are Dabeisi, S. of Qatif, with 13 wells, and 30 miles W. by S. of the same town, with 9 wells. There are a large number of Bedouin camping-grounds near wells in Biyadh. Only one place in the tract contains a settled population, the village of QasrAl Subeih, about 4 miles inland, opposite a point half-way between Abu 'Ali Island and the hill of Jubeil el-Bahri. This is a fortified enclosure, with 6 muzzle-loading guns, surrounded by 350 date-stick huts. The fort was rebuilt in 1905 'as a base of operations against the Muteir and Ahl Murrah by Sheikhs of the Had-hud and Dhaheirat clans of the Al Subeih sub-tribe of the Beni Khalid. The latter tribe is said to predominate in the N. half of Biyadh, the Ajman in the S. In 1910 some Al Bu Ainein, kin to the Beni Khalid, leaving Wakrah in El-Qatar, established themselves at Qasr Al Subeih, and intrigued with the Turkish Government. iv. Wddi el-Miydh, a long valley or depressed tract, lying inland, and extending S. from the hill of Na'airiyah on the Koweit border for more than 100 miles. It has a dark brown soil, susceptible of cultivation, and after heavy rain the ground in the N. is said to be flooded; in spring grass is abundant. The principal route between Koweit and Hofuf passes through the tract. The settled population is concentrated in the three villages of and Muleijah, and the temporary village of all in the northern part. Ntd' is about 50 miles inland from the foot of Musallamiyah Bay, about 140 miles S. by E. from Koweit, and 160 miles NNW. from Hofuf. It contains about 250 houses, three or four mosques, and ten shops kept by blacksmiths, carpenters, tailors, &amp;c. ; it is surrounded by a wall 12 feet high, with bastions and gates on the N. and S. sides. It has good water, and wheat, barley, and maize are grown by irrigation ;live stock includes camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats. The inhabitants are or settled Arabs of the 'Ajman, Hawazin, Beni Khalid, Muteir, Rasha'idah, and S. Shammar ; the Emir is head of all the settled people of the tract, who are Sunni Mohammedans. Nta' is said to recognize the authority of the Sheikh of Koweit, who, however, claims no alle giance. Sarrdr, which is also walled, is 8 miles S. of Nta', and has a mixed Arab population. The tract contains numerous ruined sites, the most considerable of which is Thaj, 24 miles SE. by S.310 HASA of Nta', formerly inhabited by Beni Khalid, and said to have Wn destroyed by Wahabi and Ajman attacks. v. The following are less important tracts : Eadd'if, between Wadi el-Miyah and the Sabkhat el -jMutaya has a firm dark soil, treeless, but with grazing of grass and plants and numerous wells. JauShamin, directly S. of Rada'if, is a s'andv plain with scrub and grass. Hahl, S. of Wadi el-Miyah, is a desert tract about 70 miles inland WSW. from Qatif town, with a soil of dark- coloured sand, in which mounds alternate with low valleys bearing marhh trees, scrub, and grass, and a large saline depression in the centre called Khor, containing wells of poor water ; in the N. part are the Beni Khalid, in the S. the Ajman. SW. of Habl, consists of low-lying rocky ground. Faruq is a long valley 30 miles W. of the Hasa oasis, and immediately E. of Summan, said to extend for about 100 miles with a varying width usually of more than a mile, and in parts to consist of a labyrinth of sand-hills; it is occupied in autumn by the Ajman, and raided at times by the Ahl Murrah and Manasir. Na'a a narrow stony tract, and Ghuwdr lie between Wadi Faruq and the Hasa oasis, S. of which is Kho/rmah, with a red sandy soil and little water, but containing depressions in which the Ajman and Ahl Murrah pasture their flocks. The well of 'Aweisah in this tract is a halting-place on the S. route from Hasa to Nejd (see Route No. 11). NW. of the Hasa oasis are J au es-Sa'addn, a low tract covered with a thin layer of sand, Badd el-Asis, a sandy plain interspersed with undulating rocky ground, and J auf, a sandy depression with numerous wells, mounds, and hollows, in which grow markh trees, scrub, and grass. Dhahrdn and Barr el-'Oqair are coastal tracts between Qatif and Eas es-Sufeirah. Both are rich in wells ; the latter has date plantations of the Beni Hajar, and contains the port of 'Oqair (see p. 308). In addition to the above tracts, three islands belong to Hasa. Musallamlt/ah, in the bay of the same name, 5 miles E. of Ras el- Bidya', has on the E. side a village of 400 houses with two forts and several wells, inhabited by Beni Khalid of the Ama'ir sub-tribe, under a sheikh, and occupied with pearl-fishing. is a smaller island of pearl-fishers, S. of Musallamiyah. SW. of Ras el-Bidya', is an uninhabited island, extending 12 miles E. to W., surrounded by pearl banks, and with an anchorage on the S. side. Zakhnunlyah, also uninhabited, lies about 10 miles ESE. of : 0qair port, and is separated from the mainland by a channel two miles wide. It is about four miles long, ban en, and without good water; upon it is a ruined fort built about 45 years ago by the Sheikh of Bahrein. The flag of the present sheikh was hoisted in 1911; theDISTRICTS 311 Turks had previously established a small garrison, which was with drawn in 1910. The ownership of the island of about 36 miles NE. by E. of Ras el-Bidya', is undetermined. It has an anchorage on the S. side, and is frequented by fishermen from Bahrein, Musallamiyah, and Jinnah, who dry fish and make turtle oil. C. BAHREIN Area The present Sheikhdom of Bahrein consists of the archipelago formed by the islands of Bahrein, and NebiSdlih, with a number of lesser islets and rocks. The whole forms a compact group almost in the middle of the gulf which separates the promontory of El-Qatar and the coast of Qatif ; the Sheikhs of Bahrein have had relations of a political nature with El-Qatar (seep. 328). The principal island has an extreme length of 30 miles from N. to S. and a maximum breadth of 10 miles. Muharraq, which lies KE, and is separated from Bahrein by a strait 1| miles broad, has a maximum diameter of 5 .&gt; miles, but owing to its horseshoe form contains little territory. Umm Na'asan, which is less than 4 miles by 2| miles, lies 3 miles off the W. coast of the main island. Sitrah, separated from the E. coast by a narrow channel, has a length of 4.1 miles from N. to S., and a maximum breadth of 1J miles. Nebi Salih, commonly called J ezlrah, lying in the inlet of Kabb on the E. coast of Bahrein, NW. of Sitrah, has a diameter of only ■&gt; mile. Physical Characteristics Bahrein Island is mostly flat and low, but rises gradually to an interior plateau 100 to 200 ft, high, in the middle of which is an oval depression about 13 miles long from N. to S. by about 4 miles broad, containing the solitary hill Jebel Dukhan, about 440 ft. in height. The descent inwards from the plateau to the depression is in most places too steep to be practicable for animals ; at the N. end is a nearly vertical drop of 20 ft., followed by a slope of 30 ft. The plateau is extremely stony, presenting on the N. side a low clin-line of about 15 ft., with a sandy plain below it, extending in all direc tions to the coast, and draining from W. to E. On the same siae of the plateau is a great field of ancient tumuli covering about 12 square miles, called by the Arabs large inlet, Khor312 BAHREIN el-Kabb, runs into the island from the E. coast nenptrat^ „ i 5?

The springs N. of the Khor el-Kabb are generally almost pure, but warm, as in Hasa • the best known are called l Addri, and C limate Through the nearness of the sea on all sides, and abundant irriga tion the atmosphere of Bahrein is damp and heavy, with a mean humidity ranging from 79-80 per cent, of saturation. Though there is much malaria and rheumatic disease, the climate is not the most unhealthy in the Gulf. The maximum temperature, usually attained m August, is about 104° F.; the minimum, reached in i)ecember or January, about 48°. The average rainfall for the years 1910-13 was 4-55 in. The weather from October to April inclusive is not unpleasant, indoor temperature ranging between bU and 85 In January and February N. winds blow, and it is cold enough for fires to be acceptable. Though the weather is hot from the beginning of May to the middle of June, the heat is still tempered by the sea-breeze, and nights are fairly cool. The oppressiveiy hot weather lasts from the middle of June to the f nC j 'I September ; in this period, though there may be irregular land-breezes, the thermometer remains persistently above 100° F. All rams fall between the middle of October and the middle of May, but actual wet days are few. The prevailing wind is the or north-wester, which blows for forty days from the second week m June and is very violent in winter; next to this in frequencyCLIMATE 313 comes the north wind, and in violence the south-wester which is fiercely hot in August and blows irregularly between December and April. See further, vol. ii, p. 346 f. Population Though no census has been taken, the population of the 4 towns niS? tillages in the principality has been estimated as over 100,000, of whom 60,000, chiefly townsmen, are Sunni, and 40,000, chiefly villagers, Shiah. The latter are for the most part Bahdrinah (see p. 299), but this class, which is mainly agricultural, is here hardly above the servile state. The most numerous Sunni com munity is that of the Huwalah, who are townsmen of Manamah, Muharraq, Budeyya, Hadd, and Halah Bin Anas, living by trade and without solidarity among themselves or influence on others. Tiig Utub 3 Sadah, and Dawasir are the most influential tribesmen, the first on account of their connexion with the ruling family, the second by virtue of their supposed sacred origin, the Dawasir because they are well disciplined by their chief and comparatively wealthy; there are also a few Beni Ivhalid (see below, p. 608). The remainder of the Sunni population live mostly on the coast, and depend for their subsistence rather on the sea than on culti vation. There are at least 5,000 free negroes and 6,000 negro slaves; a few Persians, Hindus, Basra Arabs and Jews com plete the population. Life in Bahrein is more various and many- coloured than on the mainland of Arabia : the exclusiveness of a people cut off from intercourse with other races is absent, and the opportunity to indulge a taste for luxury has not been disdained. Direct relations with Persia and India have influenced costume, domestic appliances, and the architecture of the larger houses, in which the pointed arch is a conspicuous feature. Industries and Trade The most important occupation in Bahrein is pearl-fishing, and the fisheries are the most valuable in the Gulf next to those of imcial Oman. Were the fisheries to cease, most of the urban population would have to leave the country. They employ more than 900 boats, each with a crew of about 20, the total crews amounting to nearly 20,000 men. The pearling season opens in viay, and some boats continue operations until about October, special measures had to be taken in 1915 by the Sheikh, in conjunction with the British Resident, to enable the pearl-fishing population to tide over the crisis caused by the stoppage of the314 BAHREIN pearl-trade during the war. Sea fisheries are also extensive, the fish being taken in nets and in tidal weirs or enclosures made of reeds, some of which surround large areas in the shallow waters round the coasts; 500 lb. of fish a day were supplied without difficulty to the Indian Expeditionary Eorce in 1914. Agriculture is carried on by irrigation, the chief products being fruit (dates, citrons, limes, melons, figs, &amp;c., but few of the first quality), lucerne, and a few vegetables; a great belt of date-groves on Bahrein Island runs S. from Manamah to the village of Buri, a distance of about 7 miles. Domestic animals include about 2,000 donkeys, less than 100 horses owned by the Sheikh and his family, about 100 camels, chiefly used in carrying water to Manamah for sale, and a small but fine local breed of cattle, in high repute for their milking qualities. Of the donkeys, some 200 are of the famous breed imported from Hasa, from 12 to 13 hands, and white in colour. The chief handicrafts are sail-making, weaving of abbas, lungis, and checked sheeting, and the manufacture of mats from Hasa reeds. Palgrave described the B as excelling in the crafts of the weaver, the tailor, the dyer, and the worker in metal, wood, or leather. Boat-building, with timber imported from India, employs about 200 carpenters ; Bahrein builders can turn out an excellent forty-ton boat in less than a month. Many boats are sold to purchasers in El-Qatar and Oman. Trade at the port of Manamah was for years hindered by the unsatisfactory arrangements for handling cargo, distribution being delayed, and goods left to deteriorate without any proper protec tion. In 1910 the control was given to a European, but in the following year native sentiment demanded native control, and two Arabs were appointed, with lamentable results. Since then matters have improved; a Hindu has been placed in charge, and the con struction of a jetty and storage-shed has modified the worst of the former defects. The Sheikh is entitled by treaty to an duty of 5 per cent, on merchandise. Bahrein is the principal market for the pearl-industry, the export of pearls in a good year attaining about £2,000,000. But it is also an important emporium for the east coast of Arabia, distributing merchandise from India and from countries bordering on the Persian Gulf, to El-Qatar, Qatii, and 'Oqair, from which last two ports goods are carried into the oases of Hasa and Qatif, and beyond into southern Nejd. This local trade is carried in native boats without manifests, so tha exact statistics cannot be obtained. .. The total average imports of Manamah for the three years 1911-i amounted to £2,061,038, and exports £2,106,766. During tiieINDUSTRIES AND TRADE 315 same period the figures under the three main heads averaged as follows :— Exports. £1,826,430 60,970 219,350 The principal commodities imported are rice, piece-goods, coffee, dates, sugar, tea, tobacco, spices, fuel, and animals for slaughter. Real exports other than pearls are of small value and importance, Bahrein heing a distributing and not a producing centre , a few textiles and a little sail-cloth almost complete the tale of local manufacture. The principal share of the Bahrein trade falls to the lot of India, which is responsible for more than half of the total, though many goods arriving from that country are really of Europea.n origin, sent there for reshipment owing to the lack of direct facilities, and to the fact that Bahrein has grown accustomed to placing orders in Bombay. Next to India come Persia and 'Iraq less than 10 per cent, falling to all other countries. The natural result of this preponderance is that trade is largely in the hands of Indian and Persian merchants. Besides legitimate commerce, there is a contraband traffic with the South Persian coast. In 1914 there was but a single British firm in Bahrein, Gray, Paul and Co., who are agents for the British India Steam Navigation Co. ; the only other European commercial house was that of R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., of Hamburg, which had been established for some years. On the outbreak of war there were two resident members of the latter, the manager, who was arrested and interned at Karachi, and his assistant, who belonged to the active reserve of the German Army, and escaped to Basra. The branch was then closed. There are no banks, and transactions are largely carried out by means of Indian currency notes. Steam communication is chiefly in British hands, the British ( India Steam Navigation Co. maintaining a weekly service up from Bombay and Karachi, and a fortnightly down to Karachi and Bombay. The Arab Steamers, Ltd., a line started in 1911 in oppo sition to the British company, call from Bombay about once every three weeks, and again on the return voyage from Basra. The boats of the Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Co. from Bombay call on th&lt;5 outward voyage once a month, and again on their return. Before the war, the steamers of the Hamburg-Amerika line called about once a month on the outward voyage, thus providing the only regular direct access to Bahrein from Europe. Imports.

His authority over the rest of the principality is little more than nominal, for the land is divided among various relatives of his own, who hold it as almost independent fiefs, collecting their own taxes, and administering their own justice. Thus the islands of bitran and Jsebi Salih, with all the villages on the E. side of Bahrein t0 ?: £ of 1 I S 6r el ' K abb, and the inland villages of Rifa' esh-Sharqi and Rua el-Gharbi, are held by the Sheikh's brother Khalid. The subtraction of all this territory considerably reduces the Sheikh's revenue, which is derived not only from customs, but also from agricultural duties, taxes on pearl-boats, judicial fees, and rent of town lands, shops, or khans. The Sheikh is assisted in the govern ment by a wazlr, whose aid is all the more necessary, as the ruler is frequently absent on the mainland, chiefly for sporting purposes. In the towns of Manamah and Muharraq there are deputv governors with the title of emir. Justice, in criminal cases and important civil cases, is adminis tered on behalf of the Sheikh by a chief qadhi. The treatment of minor cases depends upon the religious belief of the parties; if both are Sunnis, they go before the (Sunni) Sheikh of Muharraq : if both a ^- - ia before the (Shiah) Sheikh of Manamah. There are, in addition, seven other qadhis permitted to adjudicate upon cases reierred to them by agreement. Mercantile cases, especially those in which foreigners are con- are ^cided by a tribunal variously called or Mejhs et-Tijdrah, a Customary or Commercial Court, with per manent members nominated by the Sheikh in consultation with the British Political Agent. When one or more of the parties to a case is a British subject, or when none of them are Bahrein sub jects, the Mejlis is usually convoked by the Agent, and sits at the Agency, a representative of the Sheikh being permitted to attend, tases arising out of pearl-diving operations are settled by a special ooard of arbitration known as the Salifat Recent History and Present Politics Although the Sheikhs of the Khalifah family had been in direct relations with us since 1805, and under treaty since 1820, another ' lx J years elapsed before the ruler of Bahrein entered into a binding318 BAHREIN agreement similar to that accepted by the Sultan of Oman. By this treaty he undertakes, in return for a subsidy, to alienate no part of his territory except to the British, to conform to British policy, and to accept no help, pecuniary or other, from any foreign power! A British Political Agent, under the Resident at Bushire, is stationed at Manamah. The present ruler. Sheikh 'Isa ibn 'Ali el-Khalifah, now an old man, owed his accession in 1867 to our influence, and has been supported by us against other claimants of his family, notably Khalifah ibn Hamed ibn Mohammed el-Khalifah, who has intrigued with the Porte. Although Sheikh 'Isa is not without natural sagacity, he has proved to be lacking in the force of character and practical ability which distinguished his contemporary. Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit. In addition, he has sometimes shown himself sensitive of control, even to the point of obstructing reforms, encouraged in such courses, perhaps, by a certain impatience of foreign influence prevalent in Bahrein ; he has thus on at least one occasion incurred the censure of the Indian Government. But in spite of these short comings, he has avoided serious complications ; in the difficult times which began with the crisis in the pearl industry in 1913, and have been aggravated by the war, he has shown ability and reason able goodwill. His heir. Sheikh Hamid, is described as a man holding moderate views. Islands 1. B The general nature of Bahrein Island has been described in a previous section (p. 311). In the present place the chief centres of population may be noticed. The island has nearly 100 villages and hamlets, of which the following are the most important: Hdlah Bin Anas, a short distance E. of Manamah, with 85 huts of Sunnis, who are pearl-divers and fishermen. i Askar, on the E. coast, 4J miles ENE. of Jebel Dukhan. 75 stone houses and reed-huts of A1 Bu Ainein, pearl-divers, owning about 20 boats ; 1,500 date-palms ; a little live stock. Bildd el-Qadlm, about 1J mile SW. of Manamah fort; about 350 mud and reed huts. The inhabitants are who gam a livelihood as pearl-merchants, cultivators, or tailors; many ruined stone houses. It has a suburb to the SW. called , an on the NW. side the Suq el-Khamis, where a large market is hew 0I J Thursdays. About mile to the W. are the ruins of the Madrasa Abu Zeidan, the minarets of which, in combination with Je eIP itl ISLANDS 319 Dukhan, form a landmark for vessels entering Manamah harbour. In the ruined part of the village is the fine spring over which a modern Shiah mosque has been erected ; the water fills a tank much resorted to for bathing in hot weather. There are nearly 12,000 date-trees, with other fruit trees, and a little live stock. Bufi, 7 miles SW. of Manamah at the SW. extremity of the great date-belt. A few stone houses and 150 huts of date- growers. About 10,500 date-palms ; a little live stock. 1 mile ENE. of Budayya' town (p. 322) and f mile from the sea! Several well-built houses, and 150 huts of cultivators, weavers, and pearl-divers ; a considerable quantity of cloth for abbas woven ^ 1,500 date-palms ; live stock. Bt'ni | mile E.of Budayya ; 50 huts of BaJidrinah weavers ; good well; 1,300 date-palms ; live stock. Jau, on E. coast, 5 miles ESE. of Jebel Dukhan. A few well-built houses and about 400 huts. The people are Sunni pearl-fishers, owning about 30 boats. H miles w ' 0 f S 6 ruined Portuguese fort, el-'Ajdj, which is miles W. of Manamah fort. Large village of 300 houses, occupied by Bahannah date-growers, carpenters, lime-burners, and pearl-mer chants. Irrigated gardens with lucerne, vegetables, and fruits. 16,000 date-palms; live stock. The smaller village (50 houses) is practically a suburb. Jufeir, N. of the cape of the same name ; 80 reed huts of Baha- nnah cultivators and fishermen. Near the point of the cape is a large stone house belonging to the Wazir of Bahrein. About 900 date-palms, lucerne fields ; live stock ; 15 pearl-boats. j mile from the W. coast, 7 miles below Budayya'; 150 huts of Bandrinah cultivators and sail-makers • large date-groves ; 16 500 trees ; donkeys and cattle. Ma amir, on E. coast, opposite Sitrah Island ; 130 houses, in cluding stone buildings ; population, pearl-fishers, own- mg more than 20 boats. MdlihlyaJi, near W. coast, 8 miles below Bujiayya , and close to the landing-place for passengers from called Aqdrlyah ; 100 huts of Bahdri cultivators ; about 6,000 date-palms ; some_ 20 donkeys. Near the village, a stone-built bmah shrine. Bifd i esh -Sharqi, large village with watch-towers on a bare site 7 miles S. of Manamah, at the NE. corner of the central depression, which it overlooks. There are two large masonry houses one occupied by Sheikh Khalid ibn 'Ali, brother of the Sheikh of ■Dahrein, who governs the place, the other by another member of ruli ng family. The village itself consists of 300 mud houses occupied by Maliki Sunnis, whose living is made by selling in ivianamah the excellent drinking-water from the wells of in m 1 III i i320 BAHREIN the depression below (17 fathoms or more); another good well, 'Ain Khdlid, is in the centre of the village. The people own 85 donkeys and 16 horses. This village, like the next following, serves as a sanitorium for the island. Rifd'el-Gharhi, in a similar position to the above, from which it is distant 1J miles WNW. One large masonry house is occupied by a member of the ruling family, though the village is under the juris diction of Sheikh Khalid ; there are 40 reed huts, the inhabitants of which are Maliki Sunnis, chiefly of the 'Utub tribe. The people gain a livelihood by selling Manamah drinking-water from the well UmmGhuweifah on the plateau near the village, carrying it thither on camels. No cultivation ; some live stock. The village, like the preceding, is a sanitorium for the island. on the N. coast; a long village with a mosque, inhabited by 1,500 Bahdrinah, engaged in boat-building, fishing, and the pearl trade; 30 pearl boats ; 900 date-palms; some live stock. on the W. coast, 11 miles below Budayya'; 3 stone and 200 mud houses, inhabited by Dawasir engaged in the pearl fisheries. There is a ruined fort. The people own 30 boats; live stock includes 30 donkeys and cattle. The following are the principal towns :— 1. Manamah, the commercial capital, is an open town situated on the coast at the NE. corner of the island ; the anchorage is good, but steamers of 19 feet draught cannot come nearer than the outer anchorage 4 miles to the NW. of the town ; smaller vessels can run up to an inner anchorage 2 miles off shore in the same direction. The bottom shelves so gradually that at low water even boats cannot get within J mile of the beach, but must discharge passengers and cargo by means of donkeys ; the harbour has many nets and fish- weirs always set. Manamah with its suburbs extends 1| miles along the sea-front, and has a depth inland of about | mile. The general appearance of the town is dingy and unprepossessing; the beach quarter is occupied by fishermen's huts, and the shore is formed ot a dirty shingle. The larger buildings are of small stones cemented by mud or inferior mortar, which is apt to fall out, suggesting neglect and decay; while the ground floors are used as S 0 ' 0 0 ^ and business offices. The bazaar (450 shops), in the centre of wh ic is the market-place, has been described as ' a filthy labyrinth o narrow lanes lined by shops and generally covered over with ma s to keep out the sunIn the outskirts dwellings are usually matting huts standing in courtyards enclosed by hurdles of upright da e- fronds. The best buildings are the British Political Agency to war the NE. end; the American Mission and Hospital; Qal at ed-JJiwISLANDS 321 or Manamah fort, the Sheikh's summer residence, a large bastioned structure, standing in the open plain between the town and the date gardens behind it; a well-built house rather farther inland, belonging to Sheikh Hamid, the heir apparent, and a further large house, near the SW. end, formerly occupied by another member of the ruling family. With the exception of the new Jami' mosque, places of worship are mostly unpretentious. The former villages of RasRummrln (or Farlq Hamidah) and Na'lm now form suburbs ; the first covers a point of the same name beyond the British Agency, and is inhabited by pearl-divers, fishermen, and ferrymen serving the strait to Muharraq; the second, at the west end, is inhabited by poor Bahdrinah occupied in boat-building and pearl- fishing. The population of Manamah and its suburbs is about 25,000, of whom three-fifths are Sunnis and the remainder Shiahs ; the former, who show a noticeable infusion of negro blood, include 5,000 about 400 Arabs from Koweit, Hasa, and Nejd, 1,000 Arabs of uncertain origin, 500 'Utub, and more than 2,000 negroes, enslaved and free ; the Shiahs are composed of 12,000 of Bahrein, 1,250 Bahdrinah from Hasa and Qatif, 1,500 Persians, and a few Arabs from Basra. The Arabs from Nejd are mostly Wahabite. The small non-Mohammedan residue of a few hundred souls consists of Hindus, Jews, and Oriental Christians. Drinking-water is obtained from a well called sunk in the coral rock between the British Agency and the American Mission, and from a cistern called about a mile W. of the fort, filled by the surplus water of several springs. These are used by the poorer inhabitants ; the first is brackish, the second con taminated by ablution of men and animals. Other inhabitants buy their drinking-water from camel-men of Rifa' esh-Sharqi and Rifa' el-Gharbi, who bring it for sale from the wells in their villages (see above). For washing purposes water can be reached anywhere at about 6 feet, and almost every house has its well. For the trade of the port see p. 314 f. The town and suburbs possess about 150 pearling and other boats. The date-groves beyond the fort begin the large belt already mentioned. The number of trees belonging to the town proper is limited to about 500; a rather larger number belong to the suburb of Na'im el-Kebirah. There is a British Indian post office. Should Manamah be used as a temporary base for troops, the best site for a camp would be on the east side of the plain behind the town, where perhaps a division could be accommodated. Dis embarkation can be carried out in three places, at the beach of ARABIA I Y322 BAHREIN Qasablyah clear of the town, at the customs pier, and at the jetty of the British Agency. 2. Budeyya', near the NW. corner of Bahrein Island, stretches for about a mile along the sea with a depth of about 300 yards. It has three quarters with about 8,000 inhabitants, Fariq 'Amdmarah, Fariq ed -Ddm, and Fariq containing a con siderable number of stone houses, five or six buildings of solid masonry with upper storeys, and a tower. The people are all Sunnis, the most numerous Arab communities belonging to the Dawasir (800 houses) and 'Amamarah (100- houses). There are a large number of negro slaves (450 houses) and free negroes (200 houses), with about 60 households of Most of the people are engaged in the pearl-fisheries, and more than 100 boats are owned. The Dawasir, whose Sheikh administers the town without interference from the Sheikh of Bahrein, chiefly occupy the Budayya' and Dam quarters, obtaining their water-supply from wells in the date-plantations of Dirdz and Beni Jamrah villages ; the well of the 'Amamarah quarter is a little to the E. of the houses. 2. Mu This island lies immediately NE. of Bahrein, from which it is separated by a narrow strait a mile and a half broad ; it is of horse shoe shape, with the open side to the S. ; the maximum diameter is about 4 miles. The island is really a low sandbank surrounded by flat coral reefs which almost triple its surface at low tide; from this projects on the NW. a rocky spit called extending seaward for nearly 4 miles and constituting the chief danger to ships entering Manamah, harbour. Several marine springs rise near the coasts of the island. There are some 15 villages or hamlets in addition to Muharraq town, the more im portant of which are : 'Ardd, on a promontory on the S. coast; 100 huts of Bahdrinah date-growers, fishermen, and pearl-divers. There is a rectangular ruined fort, with sides about 90 ft. long, at the E. point of 'Arad Bay. Plantations with about 12,000 date- palms. Buseitln, on the W. coast, 1 mile N. of Muharraq town; 400 houses, some of stone, but most of date-mats. The people are Sunnis, chiefly of the Madhahakah tribe, owning about 50 boats, mostly used for pearl-flshing. Date-palms number about 1,000; carrots and lucerne are cultivated beneath the trees. Two wells in the date-grove, with brackish water. on NW. coast, 2 miles N. by E. of Muharraq town; 300 houses of mud or date- mats ; 3 mosques. Inhabitants are engaged in theISLANDS 323 pearl-fisheries, and owning more than 20 boats. Date-groves with about 1,700 trees, among which are several large wells (water at 15 ft.) serving to irrigate the groves, and fields of lucerne, Abu Mahur, on a small island some hundred yards S. of Muharraq town ; and connected with the larger island at low tide ; 500 houses and huts inhabited by Sunnis, chiefly A1 BinMaqla, with a number of negroes, enslaved and free. A number of boats are constantly engaged in taking to Muharraq water from the submarine well 600 yards E. of the fort of Abu Mahur at the S. end of the island, now used by the Sheikh as a stable. on the NE. coast; 450 mud and reed huts with two good masonry houses. The inhabitants are Sunnis, chiefly of the Manana'ah tribe, engaged in pearl-dealing or diving and sea-flshing. About 60 boats; no cultivation. The principal towns are the following :— 1. Muharraq, the residence of the Sheikh for eight months in the year, lies on the W. side of Muharraq Island, on the strait dividing it from Bahrein, and about 2 miles from Manamah. The fort of Abu Mahur, which has now no military value, stands on a small island 800 yards S. of the town, near the celebrated submarine spring of the same name which supplies the town with most of its drinking-water. At high water Muharraq is surrounded by the sea on the E., S., and W. sides, a great sanitary advantage, as the sea daily removes the rubbish shot within its reach. The population is estimated at about 20,000, half of whom are There are about 3,000 'Utub, 2,000 ll Bin 'Ali Arabs, nearly 1,000 Ziya'inah, 1,000 Bahdrinah, and 2,500 negroes, free or slaves, with smaller numbers of other tribes and aggregations. Of this population all but the Bahdrinah and a few Persians are Sunnis. The people are general merchants, shopkeepers, pearl-merchants, pearl-divers, sailors, boatmen, fishermen, small traders and craftsmen, the pearl- divers forming a much larger proportion of the community than at Manamah. The place possesses about 700 vessels, nearly one-half of which are used as pearl-boats. More than 200 donkeys, 150 head of cattle, and 80 horses are owned in the town. Muharraq has fifteen quarters, mostly named after the tribes inhabiting them ; there is a bazaar of 300 shops, but the town has no date-palms. During the hot weather the greater part of the population migrates across the strait and encamps in the NE. part m ® a ^ re ' 1 I s l an d. As the principal residence of the Sheikh, Muharraq is the political, as Manamah is the commercial, capital of the principality. It is drier and brighter of aspect than the latter city, and architecturally more impressive when viewed from the sea.324 BAHREIN 2. Hadd, on the SE. promontory. The town contains perhaps 200 well-built stone houses, and possibly as many as 1,500 mud- and-stone or mat dwellings. The population, estimated at about 8,000, consists of Sunnis, chiefly of the Sadah and Beni Yas tribes. Hadd is the greatest pearl-diving centre in the principality, owning about 170 pearl-boats. There is no cultivation. Water is obtained from wells in a date-grove called half a mile to the N. Live-stock consists chiefly of more than 100 donkeys. 3. This island lies off the E. coast of Bahrein, from which it is separated by a narrow channel. It measures 4| miles from N. to S., with a maximum breadth of 1| miles at the N. end, where there are date-groves of exceptional growth, watered from spr ing s and wells; the narrower S. end is a low expanse of sand. Sitrah is a part of the fief held by Khalid ibn 'Ali, brother of the Sheikh, who in summer resides in a bastioned house at The inhabitants of the N. part are Ba occupying seven villages or hamlets, of which the more important are : or on the N. coast, a hamlet where passengers land from Manamah or Muharraq. Khdrijlyah, near the W. coast, 1 mile from the most northerly point; fort forming the summer residence of Sheikh Khalid ; 50 reed huts of pearl-divers, fishermen, and mat- makers ; 1,500 date-palms. Marqu near the centre; 30 huts of pearl-divers and cultivators ; about 5,000 date-palms. on E. coast, near the N. end; 60 reed huts, about 30 boats, over 4,000 date-palms ; a good spring feeding a tank. Quryah, near the NW. corner ; 40 reed huts ; gardens belonging to Sheikh Khalid; 7,000 date-palms ; about 20 boats. Between Quryah and Halat is the fine spring of 'Ain er-Raha, the water of which is collected in a tank for irrigation. Sufdlah, on the E. coast, 1| mile from the N. end ; 50 mat huts; date-groves on N. side, with 4,000 trees; about 20 boats. Good water-supply from the spring at Wddiydn, J mile ESE. of Kharijiyah ; 60 reed huts ; 4,000 date- palms ; a fine spring used for irrigation. The only village in the S. part is inhabited by Sunnis. There are three rocky islets off Sitrah ; two, called are 500 yards from the N. side; the third, is 250 yards from the NW. corner. On all three Na'im Bedouins encamp during the hot weather.ISLANDS 325 4. Nebi Sdlih, Jezlrah Ihis island, lies in the inlet of K;ibb on the E. side of Bahrein Island; it measures only I mile in each direction, and is practically one large date-grove, said to contain 16,000 trees. There are two villages inhabited by Bahdrinah cultivators, pearl-divers, and fish.ei men , one, JvCijidn, with 40 houses, the other, with 35, owning about 10 boats. Two copious springs, es-Safdhiyah and l Ain el-Khadhra, supply abundant fresh water. The island is under the jurisdiction of Sheikh Khalid, brother of the Sheikh of Bahrein. About 200 yards to the N. is a still smaller i;sland, 'Jezeijyivulb, covered with date-palms, now belonging to Sheikh Khalid, but formerly to a Shiah mosque of which only the ruins remain. 5. U mm This island lies about 2 miles off the W. coast of Bahrein Island, and measures less than 4 miles in length from N. to S. by about 2^ miles in breadth ; it is uninhabited. Though low, it contains two peaks of inconsiderable height, and furnishes the best building- cement in Bahrein. There is a freshwater spring near the W. coast. The Dawasir of Budayya' and Zallaq villages on Bahrein Island send their cattle to Umm Na'asan in the hot weather for grazing. D. EL-QATAR Area Ll-Qatar is a peninsula running N. and S. with a maximum length of 80 miles and a breadth, at the base, of 40 miles ; it projects from the Arabian coast about midway up the Persian Gulf, and forms the eastern side of the Gulf of Bahrein. Its S., or land boundary, is not clearly defined. Beginning at the foot of the bay called Dohat es-Salwa on the SW., it runs SE. to the wells of Sakak, continuing thence to the E. coast, either ENE., to the N. end of the Naqiyan sand-hills, which run parallel with the sea for 30 miles from a point 10 miles S of Wakrah, or E. by S., to the S. end of the same hills, and the shore at the N. end of the Khor el-'Odeid. The Sheikhs of El-Qatar claim territory even to the S. of this ; but the British Government has recognized Khor el-'Odeid as belonging to the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi (see p. 337).326 EL-QATAR Physical Character El-Qatar has only once been traversed by a European (Burchardt), who merely followed the regular route from Hofuf to Dohah (Route No. 75) ; the interior is therefore only known from fairly comprehensive native accounts. Almost the whole of the pro montory is described as rocky and pebbly desert. The elevation of the greater part is rather greater than that of Bahrein, though the northern region at least is very low; the single hill of importance is Jebel et -Tawdr in the SE., though mention may be made of Niqa el-Mahdrah, a solitary sandstone hill, 11 miles from the coast and 25 miles S. of Dohah, used by the people of that town as a look-out post in times of war. The soil is poor, consisting, in the better districts, of gravel and marl mixed with sand; there are few fields or date-groves, and gardens exist only near towns and villages ; trees are almost wholly absent. The only extensive vegetation is coarse grass, with occasional low brushwood, but in places fine crops of natural hay are said to be produced. There is an oasis called Bu Hasa 10 miles W. by N. of Luseil, consisting of about 300 acres of low ground suitable for sheep-grazing, and containing a well called Lutheilah. A large depression, el-Bahath, lies 2-3 miles inland, beginning about 14 miles N. of the foot of Dohat es-Salwa. It has a length of 20 miles and a breadth varying from 2-4 miles ; about 1 mile from the S. end, 4 miles inland, is a group of about 10 masonry wells with indifferent water at about 9 ft. An island, Jezirah Hawdr, lies 5 miles W. of on the W. coast, with which it is roughly parallel; it is about 10 miles long, and has no permanent population, but the Dawasir of Zallaq in Bahrein have houses used as shooting-boxes in winter, and a cistern for rain-water. The islets and lie to N. and S. of Hawar, those of Ajlrah and in the channel between it and the mainland. Water is found without great difficulty in El-Qatar. In addition to wells in or near the towns and villages, there are about 100 Bedouin camping-grounds with wells, mostly masonry-lined, which can be used by those traversing the peninsula ; the water is found at depths varying from 3 or 4, to over 20 fathoms. As there appears to be no regularly frequented route of importance except that from D5hah to Hofuf, it is unnecessary to enumerate wells or pools other than those which lie on or close to the coast; such are found at Ras Quteifdn, 12 miles N. of Dohah, a group of 6 brackish wells near the base of the cape, at the foot of Dohat es -SalwaPHYSICAL CHARACTER 327 (see Route No. 75); wells on the W. side of Feishshdhh near a ruined fort; at RasDa'asah, 18 miles N. from foot of Dohat es- Salwa, a masonry well with good water, 1 mile inland, at Fahdl, 16 miles N. from the same, 4 masonry wells with good water ; at Bas Faheihll, 6 miles S. of Zubdra a single well; at Na'mdn, 7| miles S. of the same place, 2J miles inland, a stone-lined well with good water at 7 fathoms, and a ruined fort; and at Umm el-Ma, 12 miles S. of Ras 'Asheiriq, masonry wells inland from the bay, with a ruined fort built by one of the recent Sheikhs of Bahrein. Climate There are no statistics with regard to the climate of El-Qatar, but it is described as exceedingly dry. Rather more rain is said to fall in the course of the year than at Bahrein, but it may be assumed that the average does not exceed 5 inches. Tempera ture may be conjectured to resemble that.of Bahrein, but to be slightly less equable, at any rate in the interior. Population The sedentary population is composed of communities and tribes nearly all of which are common to El-Qatar and the Bahrein Islands; they fall into some 25 groups, of which the' following are the most numerous : A1 Bu 'Ainein (about 2,000), a clan of the Al Subaih sub-tribe of the Beni Khalid (see p. 608), at Wakrah; Al Bin 'Ali (1,750), Dohah ; Huwalah (2,000), and Wakrah; Khaleifat (850), Wakrah ; Al Bu Kuwarah (2,500), Sumeismah, Dha'd'in, and Fmveirat ; Ma'adhid (875), Wakrah, and Luseil; Mahandah (2,500), Khor Shaqlq and Dhakhlrah ; Sulutah (3,250), Ddhah; negro slaves (4,000), Dohah; free negroes (2,000), There are some 500 Arabs from Nejd, and an equal number of Bahdrinah and Persians. The total settled population, as estimated on the conjectural basis of native statement, would be about 26,000. The Bedouins proper to El-Qatar are the Beni Ha jar, and the small tribe of the Ka'ban, but a large body of Na'im from Trucial Oman have become detached from their tribe and now move between Bahrein and Qatar. The peninsula is also visited by Ahl Murrah from Hasa, and, in the cold weather, by Manasir from Trucial Oman ; both tribes are said to rob the villages when occasion serves. 'Ajman are occasionally seen; the tribe made a raid into Qatar in 1909. In 1904 Burchardt, travelling from Hofuf to Dohah, had to pay tax to four tribes, Ahl Murrah, Hajar, Dawasir, and Manasir : the tax was levied even on Turkish328 EL-QATAR officers. There are no data from which the numbers of the El- Qatar nomads can be deduced. Almost the entire population sedentary and nomadic, is in religion Sunni of the Maliki sect • the few exceptions are the Bahdrinah and Persians, who are Shiahs and the Wahabi Arabs from Nejd. Pbodtjcts and Trade The chief occupation in El-Qatar is pearl-fishing, supplemented in some places by the breeding of camels. The interests of the peninsula are essentially maritime; the men live by the sea, and for much of the year upon it; the towns and villages turn their backs as it were, on the barren land. There is hardly any agriculture, and date-groves appear to be confined to half a dozen towns and villages. Little live stock is owned by the settled inhabitants, but the Bedouins have the average amount possessed by nomadic tribes. Boat building is carried on by carpenters from Bahrein and Persia, and the scanty foreign trade is with Bahrein (see p. 314), and with Lingeh on the Persian coast. Pearls form almost the only export, : but until quite recently (see Chap. VIII, p. 247) the arms traffic provided a profitable re-export, rifles and ammunition from Muscat being shipped by El-Qatar boats on the Trucial Coast for Dohah, which was an important centre of distribution for Nejd and Persia. Apart from maritime relations, communication with the rest of Arabia is chiefly maintained by the route from Dohah to Hofuf, and its connexion with Nejd (see Routes Nos. 75 and 11), but little traffic goes this way. Recent History and Present Politics Prior to 1868, the Sheikh of Bahrein claimed suzerainty over El-Qatar, and was represented at Dohah by a member of his family But in that year, as a result of negotiations conducted by the British Government, the interest of this Sheikh was limited to the receipt of tribute, and this ceased on the occupation of Dohah by the Turks in 1872. The Ottoman troops consisted of about 300 men under a major, with a few guns, quartered in the fort; but the authority of the commander did not extend beyond the town, and was always precarious even there. In 1904 Burchardt, here an unimpeachable witness, noted that upon his request for permis sion to take photographs, he was referred by the Turkish com mandant to the local Sheikh, and that posts were carefully placed at night because the Arabs were well armed, not only with Martinis,RECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 329 but even with magazine rifles. The Porte, however, was strong enough to control the foreign relations of the local Sheikh, though the British Government never acknowledged the occupation; before the outbreak of war there had been negotiations between the two Powers for the removal of the garrison, which has since shared the fate of that of Hasa (see p. 303). Down to 1882, the Govern ment of India had an agreement with the Sheikh of El-Qatar similar to that signed with the Trucial chiefs ; but it was then allowed to lapse. At the present time Great Britain exercises an informal protectorate. The ruling Sheikh is 'Abdullah ibn Jasim eth-Thani, second son of the old Sheikh Jasim ibn Mohammed, who died in the summer of 1913. Before his father's death he had acted for a time as governor of the port of Dohah, though supplanted in this post by his elder brother, Khalifah, in 1912. This brother is still hostile, as are his cousins, the sons of Sheikh Ahmed eth-Thani. Sheikh 'Abdullah has maintained friendly relations with the British, which have continued during the war; he is on good terms with Ibn Sa'ud of Riyadh, for whom his father more than once acted during the latter s overtures to the Indian Government. He is not, how'ever, regarded as an energetic ruler. Towns and Villages El-Qatar is so little known that for practical purposes it has only one district—the coast and the country near it; for the interior the few facts stated in a previous section are all that we possess. The principal towns are the following : 1. Dohah, formerly better known as Bida', with a population of about 12,000, ' the miserable capital of a miserable province', stands on the S. side of a deep bay at the SW. corner of a natural harbour on the E. coast about 63 miles S. of Ras Rakan. The harbour is about 3 miles in extent, and is protected on the NE. and SE. sides by natural reefs. The entrance, less than a mile wide, is from the east between the points of the reefs; it is shallow and difficult, and vessels of more than 15-ft. draught cannot pass. The soundings within the basin vary from three to five fathoms and are regular; the bottom is white mud or clay. Dohah is a rather squalid town, built up a slope of rising ground on a frontage of nearly 2 miles, and at present consists of 8 distinct quarters, by the name of one of which it has often been known. Ihese are, from E. to W. : Al BinAli, Sulutah, esh-iSharqi, Dohah, Duweihah, Qal'at el-'Askar, and Dohah330 EL-QATAR contains a bazaar of about 50 shops and an hereditary mansion of the Al Thani, the ruling family, though the ruler himself gener ally lives 15 miles away at Luseil (see below). In Qal'at el-'Askar is the fort formerly occupied by the Turkish garrison and officials built in 1850. Bida' is the oldest quarter ; it is a compact settle ment, half occupied by Sudan, descendants of the original settlers • Rumeilah claims the residence of Khalifah, brother of the present Sheikh. Between Qal'at el-'Askar and Bida' is a space now de serted, but formerly occupied by a 9th quarter named el-Gharbi. The principal elements of the population, other than the Sudan above mentioned, are Sulutah (3,250), Al Bin 'Ali (1,750), Huwalah (1,000), Ma'adhid (500), and negroes, slaves and free (3,500), with smaller numbers of other tribes, and 600 Bahdrinah and Persians. With the exception of the who are blacksmiths, coppersmiths, and petty pearl dealers, the inhabitants live by pearl-diving, sea-fishing, and a small maritime carrying trade. About 350 pearl-boats, 60 sea-going boats running to Oman, and nearly 100 fishing-boats are owned in the place. The only well close to Dohah, called 'Weled is mile S. of the Dohah quarter. The Turkish garrison obtained most of its water from Musheirih, a group of wells 1 mile W. of the same quarter, where they kept an outpost of 8 men in a tower, and cultivated a vegetable garden. Three miles farther inland is a large stone-lined well of indifferent water named on which the town chiefly depends. The wells of Na 4 miles S. of the town, are used by the wealthier inhabitants ; they are situated near some date-palms and a fort; the water is at 2J fathoms, and the best well is called 'Aseilah. Little can be obtained in Dohah in the way of supplies. Live stock includes about 800 camels and 150 horses. 2. Wakrah, on the coast, 10 miles SSE. of Dohah, with about 8,000 inhabitants, mostly pearl-divers, sailors, and fishermen; the residence of Sheikh 'Abd er-Rahman, brother of the Sheikh of El- Qatar, who occupies a large fort J mile inland from the town, re sembling that of the Sheikh of Bahrein at Manamah, but with less massive walls. The houses are all of mud and stone, and originally formed a compact block along the beach, but of recent years a detached quarter named Rumeilah has sprung up about ^ mile to the N., under another brother of the ruling Sheikh. There is no proper harbour ; two reefs, one 7 miles to the SE., the other 1 mile to NE., imperfectly protect the anchorage. European vessels, even of small draught, cannot approach nearer than 2 miles from the shore. The chief sections of the population are Al bu 'Ainein (2,000),TOWNS AND VILLAGES 331 Khaleifat (850), Huwalah (1,000), and negroes (3,000), of whom two-thirds are slaves. Wakrah'has about 75 shops, and is a market for Bedouins ; the tradesmen belong to the and rinah classes. Pearl-boats number about 150 ; there are 20 sea going boats and 30 fishing-boats. Live stock includes about 40 horses and 150 camels. Water is fetched from about 1 mile W. of the town, where are about 15 shallow stone-lined wells round a walled date-grove, with some lucerne, belonging to the Sheikh. Two deserted towns may be mentioned : on the E. coast, was originally the chief town, and was once known to the English as ' Owhale ' ; there are numerous wells about 2 miles inland, yielding water of indifferent quality. lies almost in the same latitude on the W. coast; it was formerly a stronghold of the ruling family of Bahrein, and its site is still visited by Na'im of Bahrein and El-Qatar. It was a walled town, surrounded by 10 or 12 forts within a radius of 7 miles, only one of which, is not ruinous and abandoned. The following are the principal villages :— 1. Dha'd'in, some_ 20 miles N. of Dohah ; about 150 houses, occupied mostly by A1 Bu Kuwarah, who own about 70 pearl-boats, 10 trading vessels, and 10 fishing-boats, with 60 camels and 10 horses. Drinking water is brought from 'Awe 6 miles inland. 2. Dhakhlrah, on an inlet about 10 miles N. of the above, and consisting of about 100 houses of the Mahandah tribe, all pearl divers and fishermen, owning 15 pearl-boats, 2 sea-going boats, and 5 fishing-boats, with 10 camels. Drinking-water is from 2 miles to the NW., a masonry well with fairly good water at 6 ft. 3. Abu Dhaluf, on the NW. coast near the top of the peninsula, with about 70 families of the Manana'ah tribe, owning 20 pearl-boats, 5 other sea-going boats, and 10 fishing-boats, with 30 camels. Drink ing-water is from the well of Umm about 1^ miles inland. A broad reef fronts the village, nearly dry at low water, and making approach from the sea difficult. 4. Fuweirat, on the E. coast about 10 miles from the N. extremity, immediately to S. of a hill or cliff called Jebel el-Euweirat. The village consists of about 100 houses of the A1 Bu Kuwarah, and 50 of the Kibisah tribe, each occupying separate quarters ; it is not continuously walled, but is surrounded by towers ; all the houses are well built of stone and mud. The people are chiefly pearl-divers, owning 44 sea-going and 12 fishing-boats, but they possess some 100 camels, 60 donkeys, 20 horses, and 80 head of cattle. Water is brought from the Zarqa well, 1 mile to W., but a better supply is332 EL-QATAR obtained from the wells of Filihah and Sandn, distant 2 miles and 4 miles respectively to the SW., the latter with a fort kept in repair by the A1 Bu Kuwarah. N. of the Jebel is the now ( IpspvWi •11 n Si J — - r village of Ohanyah. 5. Khor Hassan, on the W. coast, about 10 miles from the end of the peninsula: often called Khnweir in contradistinction to i e Khor Shaqlq (see below). The inhabitants are about 80 families of the Kibisah tribe, occupying a fort, and living by pearl -diving and fishing. They have 20 pearl-boats, 5 fishing-boats, and 20 camels Drinking-water is fetched from T 3 miles to SW., where is a fort, with a stone-lined well yielding good water at 36 ft. 6. Luseil, on the E. coast, 15 miles N. of Dohah, a village of more than 50 stone and mud houses chiefly of the Hameidat tribe. Luseil contains the residence of the Sheikh of El-Qatar, who lives in a large high-walled house of stone and plaster, built about 1901, some 200 yards S. of the village. The people own 9 pearl-boats, 2 other sea-going vessels, and 3 fishing-boats, with 70 camels and 20 horses. Behind the village is a rocky hillock, on the summit of which is a two-storeyed tower ; at the foot of the hill are 3 wells with brackish water, one on the N., the two others on the W. side. 7. Buweis, near the tip of the peninsula, about 2| miles S. of Jezirat Ras Rakan. A village of 70 families of Sadah, protected by a small fort with four towers. The people own 18 pearl-boats, 2 other sea-going vessels, and 10 fishing-boats, with 4 horses and 20 camels. Drinking-water is brought from the well of 1 :t miles inland to S., and water at 18 ft. There is a reef before the village, within which boats anchor. 8. Khor Shaqlq (generally pronounced or on the S. side of the inlet of the same name on the E. coast; often called Khor or Khor el-Mahdndcoh in contradistinction to or Khor Hassan, on the opposite coast. It is a large village of 400 mud and stone houses inhabited by Mahandah of the A1 Hasan and Misandah sub-tribes, owning 80 pearl-boats, 90 other sea-going vessels, and 30 fishing-boats, with 100 camels. Near the village is a hill surmounted by a watch-tower ; under the hill is a well, Haleitdn, with good water. 9. Sumeismah, a walled village on the E. coast midway between Luseil and Khor Shaqiq, in the same bay as Dha'a'in. It is inhabited by about 250 families of the Al Bu Kuwarah tribe, with a few Kibisah, owning 50 pearl-boats, 10 other sea-going vessels, and 10 fishing-boats, besides 70 camels and a few horses. Drinking water is brought from the wells of 'Aweinat Husein, 4 miles to W.; the water of the small well Kharlqat is bitter.333 E. TRUCIAL OMAN Area This region, formerly known as the Pirate Coast, extends for more than 300 miles from the Khor el-'Odeid on the S. frontier of El-Qatar to the S. border of Ru'us el-Jibal, the northern promontory of Oman ; it receives its name from the permanent truce established between the five recognized ruling Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Sharjah, 'Ajraan, and Umm el-Qaiwein by the agreement of 1853 with the British Government. Ru'us el-Jibal (see p. 248) is an isolated district of the Sultanate of Oman, the Trucial frontier, between Ras Sha'am on the Gulf Coast and a spot between the villages of Dibah and Bei'ah on the Gulf of Oman, cutting it off from the bulk of the Sultan's territory. From Dibah- Bei'ah the eastern frontier follows the coast for about 50 miles to a point between Khor Kalba and Mureir, where it turns inland, first westwards, then southwards, passing ISL of the districts ^ of Mahadhah and Jau, till it reaches that of Khatam; from this point the inland boundary is the edge of the Ruba' el-Khali and Jafurah deserts, running more or less parallel to the Gulf. By far the greater part of the region, therefore, consists of low country along the Per sian Gulf ; only at the eastern extremity is there a mountainous district formed by the spinal range of the Oman promontory. The whole western part of this great area is little known and sparsely populated, the capitals of the five principalities affected by the truce all lying in the eastern portion. The more important land communications of Trucial Oman 'converge upon the Bireimi oasis (see p. 282), which is connected by various routes with Abu Dhabi, Ras el-Kheimah, Dibai, Sohar, and Hasa. Many routes cross the peninsula, linking places on the two gulfs ; such are those from Dibai to Shinas, Sharjah to Mureir, Umm el-Qaiwein to Fujeirah, and Ras el-Kheimah to Dibah. Physical Character The coast along the Persian Gulf is low and monotonous ; the hills visible from the sea in the NE. section near Ras el-Kheimah soon recede from view. To the W. of Abu'Dhabi the shore is lined by a labyrinth of shoals, reefs, and islands, rendering navigation difficult even for native boats. To the E. of that place it is open, but shallow, and exposed to the full force of the (NW. wind).334 TEUCIAL OMAN The coast on the Gulf of Oman is bolder, the hills sometimes coming down to the water's edge, and the hilly tract inland, perhaps 20 miles in breadth, is the highest part of the whole territory. The interior of Trucial Oman, approached from the Persian Gulf, consists of a low and sandy maritime plain (taff) almost entirely unsuited for tillage, though not without natural vegetation and even wood and provided with enough wells and water-holes to support a scanty Bedouin population. Beyond the are inland plains containing tracts with occasional cultivation, of which Jin, and Llwah are the best known. Climate Between November and April the heat is bearable and the nights are cool. From May to September the climate is excessively hot. The rainfall, which is confined to the winter months, is believed to be about 5 in., and would therefore approximate to that of Bahrein (see p. 312). Population The ethnology of the tribes inhabiting Trucial Oman is often intricate and perplexing. The tribes which are numerically the most important are the following : Beni Yas, in the Abu Dhabi Principality (10,000 settled, 2,000 nomadic); Sharqiyin, in the Shame tract and district in the Oman promontory (7,000 settled) ; Al Ah, chiefly at TJmm el-Qaiwein (6,750 settled) ; Al Bu Maheir, in all coast towns (5,500) ; Sudan, in coast towns and Island (5,000);' Na'im, in Central Oman promontory (3,500 settled and 1,200 nomad) ; Za'ab, in Jezlrat el-Hamra and Khor in the Sharjah Principality (3,500) ; Ahl Ras el-Kheimah, in the town and district of that name (2,000) ; Shihuh (2,500) and Taneij (2,500 settled and 1,500 nomad), in the same places ; Beni Qitab (2,000 nomad), in Sharjah territory; Shweihiyin (2,000), in and Sharjah. Several of these tribes are also represented in the Sultanate of Oman, in El-Qatar, and in Bahrein. In addition may be mentioned 1,500 Huwalah in Shdrjah town ; 1,400 Baluchis at ; about 2,500 Persians in Abu Dhabi and Dibai towns, Khor and ; some hundreds of Hindus in the coast towns, and numerous negro slaves. The total population has been estimated at over 80,000 only 8,000 being nomadic. The people are divided between the HinawiPOPULATION 335 and Ghafiri political factions (see Chap. VIII, p. 240), the former being Sunnis of the Maliki sect, the latter virtually Wahabis, though not of the militant order. Modern rifles are widely distributed both in town and country, but the traffic in arms has now been virtually suspended (cf. p. 247). I ndustries and T rade The most important industry is pearl-diving, which in summer employs most of the able-bodied men with more than 1,200 boats ; though during the winter some of the divers take part in the ordinary fisheries (the second great industry of the coast), the majority take their ease, retained by the pearl-boat owners and contractors, by whom they are supported through the slack season. Agriculture employs the settled population of the interior; vege tables are raised by irrigation from wells in most places, and dates are also grown, though they seldom fully ripen S. of Ras el-Kheimah. Cereals only succeed in a few favoured spots such as in the Shameiliyah district. The live stock of the villages consists of camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats ; horses are rare. The Bedouins subsist chiefly by their herds. In winter, when there is pasture, they roam far and wide ; in the hot weather they gather about the more abundant wells, such as those of the plain in the N'., and Beinunah in the W. Pearls are the most valuable export, and are sent almost entirely to India from the port of Dibai. The oyster-shells from which the pearls are taken come next in importance ; it is questioned whether the practice of selling these, instead of at once returning them to the sea, may not in the long run tend to exhaust the pearl-banks. Dried fish are exported from Abu Dhabi. The imports in order of their value are : grain and pulse, from India and Persia ; cotton piece-goods from India ; dates and date- juice from 'Iraq; coffee, chiefly from India; sugar, from or through India, and miscellaneous provisions from Persia. The only steam ship port is Dibai, but the other coastal towns are used by native sea-going boats running to and from India, Persia, and 'Iraq. Inland trade with the Bedouins is of no great volume, but Trucial Oman shares that of the Bireimi oasis with the Sultanate. The coast between Has Musandam and Abu Dhabi was formerly used as a base by smugglers of arms, bringing rifles and ammunition from Sohar through Bireimi, and loading for Persia and El-Qatar either at the coastal towns, or at lonely spots between them. Within recent years it was necessary to warn the Sheikhs of 'Ajman, Sharjah,336 TRUCIAL OMAN and Dibai for their connivance in this traffic ; in 1910 resistance was offered at Dibai to an armed party from H.M.S. an encounter resulting in loss of life on' both sides. Such illegal traffic satisfied the adventurous spirit of a maritime people, whose indulgence in buccaneering before the policing of the Gulf earned for their W. littoral the name of the Pirate Coast. But the estab lishment of the Arms Warehouse at Muscat (see Chap VIII, p. 247) has cut off the principal source of supply. Local manufactures are few, and their products not sufficiently extensive to be exported. Fine sheep-wool abbas are made at Sharjah and daggers at Has el-Kheimah. The latter are of the curved form universal along the Gulf from Koweit to the S., as also in parts of Western India. R ecent H istory and P resent P olitics The position of the five ruling Sheikhs is regulated by two agree ments with the British Government. The first, signed in 1853, provides for the cessation of hostilities at sea between the signa tories, and imposes on Great Britain the duty of enforcing peace and obtaining reparation for breaches of it. The second, signed in 1892, binds the Sheikhs not to enter into correspondence or agree ment with any power other than the British Government, not to permit the agent of any other Government to reside within their territories, and not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise alienate to any other Government any part of their respective territories. The apparent effect of the two agreements is to place the foreign relations of the Sheikhs under British control, and to make Great Britain responsible for their protection should they be endangered through carrying out their obligations. In 1913 there was a certain apprehension, especially at Abu Dhabi, that the victorious Emir of Nejd might extend his conquests on the side of Oman. The number of Trucial chiefs recognized by Great Britain may at any time be increased. The Sheikhs of Eas el-Kheimah, Hamriyah, and Fujeirah are already practically independent. The sheikhdoms are very unequal in importance, ranging from considerable terri tories like those of Sharjah and Abu Dhabi to small districts con sisting of little more than a single township and its environs. In the following sections the Principalities, or Sheikhdoms, are described in order from east to west.II lU THE PRINCIPALITIES 337 T he P rincipalities I. A bu D habi This principality is the largest in area and only second in impor tance to Sharjah. It stretches along the coast from the creek of Ghanadhah on the N. to that of 'Odeid on the W., a distance of over 200 miles. Towards the interior the boundaries are ill defined ; they are said to extend on the E. to the Bireimi oasis, and on the S. to the margin of the Ruba' el-Khali desert. The settled population is believed to be between 10,000 and 15,000, while the Bedouins (chiefly Beni Yas and Manasir) may number nearly 4,000. The ruling Sheikh is Hamdan ibn Zeid el-Khalifah, who succeeded his brother Tahnun in 1912, and is described as a firm ruler, able to maintain order. During the period of anxiety following the vic tories of Ibn Sa'ud of Nejd in 1913, he endeavoured to introduce arms and ammunition on the plea that the Emir might invade his territories (see above). In the same year he negotiated a truce between the Sultan of Oman and the rebel chiefs. He appears to be a worthy descendant of his predecessor Zeid ibn Khalifah, who in 1908 was the most powerful personality in Trucial Oman. The principality consists of the following districts from E. to W. : Abu Dhabi, Dhafrah (including Beinunah and Liwah) Sabkhah Matti, Mijan, and 'Aqal, with the possible addition of Khatam. It further includes the islands of Arzanah, Dayyinah, Dalmah, Das, Qarnein Salali, Yas, and Zirko. i. Abu Dhabi, the 'home district', consists of undulating sandy desert, with scanty grazing and poor water-supply; there are, however, wells on or near the routes to the Bireimi oasis at Huweil, Masheirif, and Juhar, and at Silmlyah, 20 miles SSE. of Abu Dhabi town. SuqI bits, about 25 miles E. of the town, is a fantastically shaped outcrop of sandstone forming a landmark on the main Bireimi road. Sameih, 6 or 7 miles E. of Kb or el-Ghana- dhah, is a hilly place with 7 wells of poor water used as a rendezvous by tribesmen of Abu Dhabi and Dibai when preparing for war. The only village of consequence is on the N. shore of the inlet of the same name, miles SW. of the nearest part of Abu Dhabi town; it consists of 130 date-branch huts belonging to the A1 Bu Maheir and Sudan tribes ; it has some date plantations with wells, and 50 pearl-boats. The town of Abu Dhabi is situated on the coast, about 88 miles • SW. of Sharjah, with a population of over 6,000. It extends for about 1| miles along the shore, and consists chiefly of mat huts, ARABIA I v338 TRUCIAL OMAN with only a few stone buildings ; the Sheikh's large rectangular fort, with towers at the corners, is a little distance inland behind the town, and on the outskirts in the same direction is a bazaar of Indian traders from Tatta in Sind. There are some indifferent wells at the back of the town, and shallow pits yield water at a place 3-4 miles distant; formerly water was brought by sea from Dibai. The bazaar has about 70 shops, more than half of which are kept by Persians, and a third by Hindus. The people live almost entirely by pearl-diving and fishing, there being little culti vation, but they own more than 700 camels. About half are of the Beni Yas tribe, the remainder of various other tribes, chiefly A1 Bu Maheir, Sudan, and Marar. The Persians number 500, the Hindus less than a hundred. At high tide Abu Dhabi becomes an island, through the connexion of creeks and backwaters. About 10 miles inland there is a ford on the creek called Khor el-Maqta', connecting the interior of Khor el-Batin with the sea at a point 2 or 3 miles beyond the town. Here a fort on a sandbank in the middle of the creek commands the passage to the mainland, which can only be made on foot at low tide. ii. Dhafrah, between the Persian Gulf on the N. and the Great Desert on the S., is bounded on the W. by Sabkhat Matti and the Jafurah desert, and on the E. by Khatam. It is a vast region, containing at least five known tracts, Quj'a. and Dhafrah Proper. Liwah, the most important, lies farthest inland ; it is a narrow belt 176 miles long, running E. and W., and consisting of undulating white sand-dunes, with a series of more than 20 depressions, each of which contains fertile soil and supports the cultivation of a neighbouring village ; water is obtained at about 12 ft. Beinunah is a tract of heavy red sand or soil, with scrub and grazing, lying NW. of Liwah, and between it and the Gulf. Qufa, N. of Liwah, is a barren region of sandy ridges, with a few shallow wells; Taff, a maritime strip extending the whole length of Dhafrah. The tract of Dhafrah Proper is E. of Beinunah, and resepibles it in character. The inhabitants of the whole of Dhafrah belong to the Beni Yas and Manasir tribes. The remaining tracts are of less importance, iii. Sabkhah Matti is a coastal district W. of Bei nunah, extending for a distance of about 30 miles and consisting of a saline or nitrous marsh without wells or vegetation, iv. W. of the preceding, is a district of stony mounds and firm pebbly tracts, with some grazing in winter, and a good many wells, v. 'Aqal, between Mijan and the base of the peninsula of El-Qatar, is a tract of heavy dark sand. vi. Kh lies NE. of Dhafrah Proper,THE PRINCIPALITIES 339 and is said to be a meeting-ground of the Beni Yas, Manasir, and Na'im tribes. Of the islands, only Dalmah and Yds need be described. The former lies more than 40 miles E. by S. of the mouth of the Khor el-' Odeid, and about half that distance from the nearest point of the coast to the SE. It is 5 miles by 2| miles, and for the most part hilly, with wells of brackish water and deposits of red oxide of iron. There is a small settlement of Beni Yas ; but the chief importance of the island is that at the end of the pearling season a temporary bazaar is set up, and persons engaged in the trade, including the Indian merchants of the Trucial Coast, go there to collect debts and purchase pearls. Yas is about 20 miles SE. of Dalmah, and only a few miles from the shore at Jebel Dhannah. It is 6| miles by 5 miles, with low shores, but central volcanic hills ; at the S. end is a landlocked natural harbour known to British sailors as Meriton Bay, with a depth of 4-6 fathoms. Water is only obtainable after rain. The island is visited in winter by Beni Yas fishermen. II. D ibai This small principality lies on the Gulf Coast S. of Shariah, between Abu Heil on the N. and the creek Khor Ghanadhah on the S. • its extent towards the interior is not precisely known. It consists of low sandy country without important natural features, the only hill being Jebel el-'Ali, 19 miles SW. of Dibai town, which, though only 225 ft. high, is a landmark visible for 17 miles. The town contains almost the whole settled population, the only other places with permanent inhabitants being the small coast village of rah, 3 miles to the SW., and the larger isolated village of Hajarein 50 miles away to the SE. in the Wadi Hatta, an isolated dependency' geographically belonging to the Sultanate of Oman. The ruler of Dibai is Sheikh Sa'id ibn Makhtum, who succeeded his cousin Buti ibn Suheil in 1912, and is at feud with the latter's family. He is a wealthy chief, owing to the commercial importance of his capital, but his relations with the Indian Government have not been uniformly good ; in August 1913 he had to be warned because a boat of H.M.S. Sphinx was fired on from the town. There had been trouble under previous rulers, chiefly owing to the use of Dibai by smugglers of arms (see above, p. 336). The town of Dibai, with a population perhaps not far from 20,000, lies 7 miles SW. of Sharjah and 79 miles NE. of Abu Dhabi, on both sides of a creek with a shallow entrance extending some miles to the SE. ; it was once walled, but with the exception of towers on y 2340 TRUCIAL OMAN the landward side, the defences are ruinous. There is good water in wells from 5 to 30 ft. deep. The town has three main quarters: (1) Deirah, on a tongue of land on the NE. side of the creek, between it and the sea, with a date-grove at the back, contains the main bazaar of 350 shops and about 1,600 houses, inhabited by Arabs Persians, Baluchis, and others ; (2) on the SW. side of the creek, contains a residence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, with about 250 houses all occupied by Arabs, domicile being for bidden to others ; (3) Dibai proper, on the same side but farther from the sea, with about 200 houses, 50 shops, and the principal mosque, is the quarter in which British-Indian subjects are collected. The chief elements of the population are ; Beni Yas (440 houses), A1 Bu Maheir (400 houses), mixed Arabs, including natives of Hasa, Bahrein, and Koweit (400 houses), Persians (250 houses), Sudan (250 houses), and Baluchis (200 houses). The people own about 4,000 date-trees ; other cultivation is confined to a little lucerne; live stock includes nearly 2,000 camels, 400 donkeys, 400 head of cattle, and about 1,000 goats. There are about 335 pearl-boats, and 20 sea-going vessels. The importance of Dibai lies in its increasing use as a port of call for steamers, which lie outside the creek ; the place has largely supplanted Lingeh in Persia as the chief distributing centre of foreign goods to the interior, especially to the Bireimi oasis. Before the war, steamers of the British India and Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Companies called at the port, the first at regular fort nightly intervals. III. S haejah This is the most important of the principalities, having coasts on both gulfs, and covering a considerable portion of the Oman promon tory. With the exception of the Sheikhdoms of Ajman and Umm el-Qaiwein on the W. coast, and a part of the interior which is to all intents and purposes independent, it practically includes every thing between a line from Sha'am to Dibah on the N., and Sharjah town and Khor Kalba on the S. The principality is nominally all under the Sheikh Khalid ibn Ahmed, who succeeded Sajar ibn Khalid in 1914. But, as in Bahrein, his resources are curtailed by the cession of important territory as fiefs or appanages. The Sheikh rules Sharjah town and district, and the Oasis of Dheid is adminis tered by a Vali in his name. But Ras el-Kheimah, under the late reign, had almost attained a recognized independence; and the important Shameiliyah district on the Gulf of Oman, nominally a fief held by a member of the ruling family residing in'Aiman, has£72 THE PRINCIPALITIES 341 broken from control under the influence of the sheikh of Eujeirah. The town of Dibah, the appanage of another relative, who enjoys the title of Vali, in like manner adds nothing to the exchequer of the Sheikh. The principality, in its undiminished state, consisted of four districts, Ras el-Kheimah in the N., Shameiliyah on the E., Dheid in the interior, and Sharjah proper on the W. The island of Sirri is claimed by Persia, and is no longer effectively occupied by the Sheikh of Sharjah. The districts are described in the following sections : i. Ras el-Kheimah is divided from the Ru'us el-Jibal district of the Oman Sultanate on the NE. by a line running obliquely from Ras esh-Sha'am on the W. coast of the promontory to a point between the villages of Dibah and Bei'ah on the E. coast ; on the W. its boundary is the sea ; the S. boundary follows a line drawn from Jezirat el-Hamra to the S. extremity of the Jiri plain, from which point a line to Dibah forms the limit on the SE. The district consists of low sandy desert near the sea, rising to the hill country of the Oman promontory. Its chief subdivisions are the plain of Sir, a cultivated strip on the coast, extending from about 3 miles S. of Rams to about 7 miles S. of Ras el-Kheimah town, with a length of about 12 miles and an extreme breadth of about 5 miles in the S.; and J iri, immediately S. of Sir, a cultivated plain of dark soil between the Oman hills on the E. and sandy desert on the W. The upper part of the Wadi Ham, dividing the district from Shameiliyah, belongs to Ras el-Kheimah. Several islands are also connected with the district. Jezirat el -Hamra (also called which is low and sandy, lies 12 miles WSW. of Ras el-Kheimah town; it runs for 2 miles parallel to the coast, with which it is nearly joined at low water. BuMiisa, in the Gulf, about half-way between Sharjah town and Lingeh on the Persian coast, has a maximum length of about 3 miles ; it also is low and sandy, with occasional isolated hills, possessing about 20 wells and a small date plantation. There is a permanent population of about 20 households from in Sharjah, owning pearl-boats and live stock, and a shifting popu lation composed of fishermen from the mainland of Oman and Persians who work deposits of red oxide of iron for a Lingah con tractor. Sir Bu Na'air lies about 70 miles from the coast, a little S. of W. ; it is 2| miles by 2 miles, uninhabited, with hills of volcanic rock, a low sandy point in the SE., and neighbouring pearl-banks ; it possesses brackish wells and salt deposits in the hills. about 32 miles NE. of Bu Musa, with a few permanent inhabitants and a well on the S. side, is about 2^ miles in diameter, and rises342 TRUCIAL OMAN to 166 ft. at its highest point; except for a little grazing it is barren Ndbiyu Tnnb, 8 miles to the W. of Tunb, with an area of 1 mile by f mile, is uninhabited and without water. The town of Ras el-Kheimah, consisting of about 1,000 houses and forming the administrative centre of the district, is on the Gulf Coast about 48 miles N. of Sharjah town. Sheikh Salim ibn Sultan claims to be independent of Sharjah, but his independence has not yet been recognized. The town stands upon a narrow spit of land 2| miles long, running parallel to the coast and connected with the mann l ^ j at the SW. end ; the creek between the spit and the shore, though its entrance at low tide is only 2 ft. deep, has a general depth of 9 ft., and forms a good anchorage for native boats ; large vessels must anchor 2-| miles to 3 miles NW. of the town. About half of the houses are of stone and gypsum mortar, the remainder of date-branches. There is an old fort of no military value, and a ruinous wall crosses the isthmus SW. of the town. The inhabitants are a mixed race known as Ahl Ras el-Kheimah, oeeupy- ng 400 houses, Maharah (250 houses), Al 'Ali (150 houses), and ATBu Maheir (120 houses), with a few Na'im, Baluchis, andKhojahs. Drinking-water is scanty and of poor quality. The town possesses about 16,000 date-palms, while the large groves belonging to begin on the mainland opposite the town. The people own 33 pearl- boats and 15 other sea-going vessels, with about 120 fishing-boats; ive stock includes s ome 800 goats, 150 cattle, 175 donkeys, 130 camels, and 20 horses. Trade resembles that of other ports on the Trucial Coast ; the chief manufacture is of daggers. At Maharah, the site of an old village on the E. side of the creek, there is usually a tem porary colony, sometimes of Persians from Rams. The chief villages, of 100 houses and above, are as follows : In Ras el-Kheimah district : 1. Rams : 400 houses, mostly of mud and stone, on the coast about 8 miles NE. of Ras el-Kheimah town, on the S. side of a small creek with shallow entrance. The inhabitants are Taneij, chiefly pearl-divers and fishermen, but owning date plantations partly situated at Dhdyah, a place now uninhabited, 2 miles inland. Live stock includes 500 goats, 50 donkeys, 20 camels, 20 head of cattle. 2. Sha'am : about 300 houses, mostly of mud, on the coast 17 miles NNE. of Ras el-Kheimah town and 2 miles S. of Ras Sha'am. Inhabitants are all Shihuh, occupied with pearl-diving, fishing, and cultivation, and owning a few pearl-boats and coasting vessels, with 7,000 date-palms. Live stock : 50 donkeys, 30 camels, 20 head of cattle. About 1 mile S. is a small tower upon a hillock used for defence.THE PRINCIPALITIES 343 3. Dibah, on the coast of the Gulf of Oman, 1 mile S. of Bei'ah; the most southerly village of the Sultanate ; nearly 200 houses, half of which are occupied by the peasant class known as Bayadir, the rest by 'Awanat, Naqbiyin, and Sharqiyin ; good wells with water at 25 ft.; 10,000 date-palms. Live stock: sheep, goats, donkeys, and camels. Dibah is held as a fief by a relative of the Sheikh, who also governs the small village of W a few miles to the W. In the tract of Sir ;— 4. Shimil, 5 miles inland ; 200 houses of Beni Shameili; 4,000 date-palms. Live stock : sheep, camels, and a few head of cattle. In the tract of Jiri:— 5. Khatt, under the hills on the E. side of the plain about 12 miles SSE. of Ras el-Kheimah town; 100 houses. Oasis of 20,000 date- palms, and a hot spring used for irrigation. Live stock of sheep, donkeys, camels, and cattle. In Jezirat el-Hamra island :— 6. Village of the same name : 500 houses of the Za'ab tribe, divided into two quarters, Umm and ; 25 pearl- boats. Live stock ; 500 sheep, 100 camels, 100 donkeys, and 150 cattle. ii. fShameillyah, on the coast of the Gulf of Oman, extending for more than 30 miles from Gharfah on the N., to Khor Kalba on the S., and inland to the Wadi Ham, the boundary towards Sharjah district, the lower part of which it includes. The hills in the N. approach the coast, but recede from it in the S. The principal villages, all on the coast, are the following, in order from N. to S. :— 1. Bidydh ; 300 houses of Sharqiyin, fishermen, and cultivators of dates, wheat, and maize ; 10 sea-going boats running to Sib and Muscat; 3,500 date-trees. Live stock : 200 head of cattle, 100 sheep and goats, donkeys and camels. 2. Khor Fakkdn, fief of a relative of the Sheikh; about 5 miles S. of Bidyah on the S. shore of a bay with sheltered boat harbour at its E. end ; 150 houses of Naqbiyin and Persians, living by cultivation of wheat and dates and by pearl-diving; good water; 5,000 date- palms ; a few shops ; 4 or 5 coasting vessels running to Muscat. 3. Fujeirah, 15 miles S. of Khor Eakkan, but about 2 miles from the sea; its landing-place is called Ghareifah. Eujeirah is surrounded by a 9-ft. wall, with an outer ditch and breastwork on the S. and W. sides. It has 150 houses, chiefly of mud and stone, occupied by Sharqiyin pearl -divers and cultivators. It is the stronghold of the Sharqi leader, Nasir ibn Shahin et-Tawar, who claims independent rule over the village and a considerable neighbouring tract.344 TRUCIAL OMAN 4. Ghdllah (or Kalba), 4 miles S. of Fujeirah ; about 300 houses chiefly of date-branch, and a few mud go-downs ; a small fort held by a representative of Sharjah. Inhabitants chiefly Naqbiyin and Sharqiyin, fishermen and cultivators. About 25,000 date -palms and tobacco plantations in the hills ; wheat also grown. About 10 sea-going boats run to Muscat, Mekran, and the Persian Coast. 5. Khor Kalba, 4 to 6 miles S. of Ghallah, situated on a creek and defended by a fort; 160 houses of the Za'ab tribe, who own a few sea-going boats. Not to be confounded with Ghallah which is also called Kalba. iii. Dheid, a plain measuring about 15 miles in each direction, situated in the interior about 30 miles due E. of Sharjah town; it is bounded on the E. by the hills forming the backbone of the Oman promontory, on the W. and N. by sand-dunes, and on the S. by the shingly plateau of Qallah Mahafidh. Dheid is fairly well wooded, containing numerous acacia trees, and after rain pro duces abundance of coarse grass. It is also sufficiently watered; a stream {felej) flowing from Wdd in the hills to the SK irrigates the cultivation round Dheid village. There are also wells at Muraqqibdt, 3-4 miles N. of the village, on the route across the promontory from Umm el-Qaiwein to Fujeirah, in the Fareikh valley, a few miles NW. of Muraqqibat, at Tu'i 'AM, 6 miles SSW. from the village under the sand-dunes bordering the plain, and at 3 J miles S. by E. of the village in the Wadi Katheirah on the route to the Bireimi oasis. In the summer months a continuous hot wind blows; at other times the climate is not oppressive. There is only one village of any size in the district:— Dheid, consisting of about 140 date-leaf huts inhabited by Taneij, Beni Qitab, and Na'im ; in the quarters occupied by the first and last there are fortified mud towers. On the E. side of the village is a large fort of the Sheikh of Sharjah, with a tower at each angle, and held by the governor of the district. Through the precincts of the fort runs the above-mentioned stream, the water being systematically distributed to the cultivators of the neighbouring date-groves ; before being tapped for irrigation it is about 3 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep, clear, and with a strong flow. A little wheat is grown, and there is the usual complement of domestic animals. ' There is reason to think that in the event of British or Indian troops being required in Trucial Oman, Dheid would be the most suitable station for them in the interior, at least during the cold weather. The water- supply is excellent and ample; camel and other grazing is abundant; and the place is probably already accessible for wheeled transportTHE PRINCIPALITIES 345 froju Has el-Kheimah town by way of the Sir and Jiri plains, besides which there are camel routes through the hills connecting it with the ports of the Shameiliyah district on the other side of the Oman promontory.' {Persian Gulf Gazetteer.) iv. Sharjah, a narrow strip of sandy desert on the W. coast between Ajman and Dibai; the Sheikh of Sharjah also claims the allegiance of Hamrlyah on the other side of 'Ajman. The chief centres of a population amounting in the aggregate to about 20,000 are three coastal villages and the town of Sharjah. The town of Sharjah, the capital, and residence of the Sheikh, is the most important town on the Trucial Coast. It is situated between 'Ajman and Dibai, and extends for more than a mile along the E. shore of a small creek parallel to the sea, a detached quarter, Layyah, standing on the opposite shore ; at low tide the entrance to the creek, on the NE., has only about 2 ft. of water. At the S. end of the town is a bluff rising 30—40 ft. ; inland the country is sand with scattered date-groves. There are numerous masonry buildings, including 21 mosques, but most of the houses are of date- branches, and the streets are really narrow and crooked lanes. The population of about 15,000 is composed of Shweihiyin (400 houses), Huwalah and Sudan (300 houses each), A1 'Ali, A1 Bu Maheir' Abadilah and Matarish (200 houses each), Na'im (100 houses), and mixed tribes (700 houses) ; nearly all the Arabs are Wahabis, calling themselves Hanbali Sunnis. About 200 British-Indians reside in the town, whose interests are protected by a native agent from the British Residency at Bushire. The bazaar has 200 shops, and there is an equal number of warehouses for wheat, rice, and dates. The chief manufacture is of fine woollen abbas. A few sea going boats are also built yearly, and about 20 vessels run to Basra, the Persian Coast, Bombay, and occasionally to Yemen ; there are also nearly 200 pearl-boats, with an equal number of fishing-boats. Date plantations contain some 4 000 trees, and live stock includes about 500 camels, 550 donkeys, 2,200 sheep and goats, and some cattle. The villages are :— I. Hamrlyah, 12 miles NE. of Sharjah town and 6 miles NE. of Ajman, about 300 houses. It is situated on the N'. side of a creek defended by a fort on the shore, and by several towers. The inhabi tants are chiefly Na'im, owning about 20 pearl-boats and 1,000 date palms, with live stock including camels, donkeys, cattle, and sheep. The local Sheikh, 'Abd er-Rahim, nominally under Sharjah, is practically independent, and may ultimately be recognized as a Trucial chief.346 TRUCIAL OMAN 2. Heir, between Sharjah town and 'Ajman, defended by 7 or 8 towers ; 250 houses of Na'im, owning 25 pearl-boats, 2,500 date- palms, and live stock of camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats • wells 3-5 fathoms deep. , 3. Khan, on the N. side of an inlet about 2 miles SW. of Sharjah town. About 200 houses, chiefly of stone set in gypsum mortar or mud ; inhabitants, Al Bu Maheir, Mazari', and Manasir, owning 74 pearl-boats and 40 fishing-boats, with camels, donkeys, cattle, and goats, IV. 'Ajman A small principality consisting of the town of the same name and its environs, situated 6 miles SW. of Hamriyah, and 5 miles NE. of Sharjah, in the territory of which it forms an enclave. It lies on the S. side of the entrance of a creek with 5 feet of water on the bar at low tide. The population is less than 1,000, chiefly Al Bu Maheir and Na'im, all pearl-divers and fishermen, owning about 40 pearl- boats and 25 fishing-boats. Fresh water is obtained from wells 9 ft. deep, of which the locality is constantly changing. There are date plantations with about 2,000 trees, but no other cultivation. Live stock includes camels, donkeys, cattle, goats, and a few horses. The Sheikh, Hamid ibn 'Abd el-'Aziz, who succeeded his murdered father in 1910, is of a rough and quarrelsome character; he has given trouble by connivance at the illicit traffic in arms. Friendly relations usually subsist between the Sheikh and the inhabitants of Bireimi, V, Umm el-Qaiwein Another small principality composed of a town with the adjoining country, and also forming an enclave in Sharjah. It extends north wards to Jezlrat el-Hamra and southwards part of the way to Ham riyah, The town lies about 12 miles NE, of 'Ajman and 18 miles NE. of Sharjah, on the E. end of a peninsula, forming, with a neighbouring island, a landlocked creek with very shallow entrance ; it is defended by a wall across the isthmus, and by detached block-houses. There are about 1,000 houses, 250 of which are of stone, the rest of date- branches ; they include 20 shops. The inhabitants, numbering some 5,000, belong chiefly to the Al 'Ali tribe, and are mostly pearl- divers and fishermen, owning about 70 pearl-boats and 60 fishing- boats, with a sea-going vessel running to Bombay ; about 20 boats are built yearly in the town. Live stock includes 720 camels, with donkeys, horses, sheep, and goats. The water is good, obtained fromTHE PRINCIPALITIES 347 wells 6 ft. deep ; date plantations comprise about 1,500 trees. The only pomt of importance not on the coast is Felej about ^ I ^ 3 r e ^i^ . o: ? ^ own ? with about 5,000 date-palms belonging to the oheikh, irrigated by a stream ; this is a place of assemblage for rm? U1 cvu Umm el-Qaiwein service when called to arms. The bheikh, Rashld ibn Ahmed, is at feud with his expelled half- brother Nasir, who disputes his title. In 1914, on his persistent xi Tvr oo n cer tain claims of Nasir, Rashid was coerced by . , . iox, Dartmouth, and Odin, and forced to pay Rs. 10,000, with a fine of Rs. 15,000.CHAPTER X NEJD Area This region is equivalent to Central Arabia, south of lat. 27° N. and between (roughly) longitude 43° and 47° E. The name ' Nejd' is used as convenient, although, to an Arab, it would not signify merely what is intended here, but either Jebel Shammar also and the high steppes west, or (in the strictest use) the high steppe and desert alone. Our ' Nejd', then, is bounded north by Jebel Shammar; west by the high steppes lying east of Hejaz and Asir; south by the Great Desert; east by the Dahanah Desert lying to west of Hasa. It is a loosely linked group of nine more or less settled districts (from north to south), Qasim, Sedeir, Woshm, 'Aridh, Kharj, Harici, Aflaj, Saleyyil, and Dawasir. Nejd measures about 450 miles from the extreme N. of Qasim to the extreme S. of Dawasir, and some 200 miles from the W. of Woshm to the E. of Sedeir. But if we follow its curving N. and S. axis, we get a length of well over 500 miles. Physical Character A. Belief Physically Nejd falls into three parts :— I. A northern valley region determined by the middle basin of the Wadi Rummah, which lies SE. by NW., and including the lower courses of underground tributary drainage from left and right. This is Qasim. The floor of this region, sandstone in the south but becoming chalky in the north, is, to a large extent, covered by drift-sand, but remains exposed and topped by sandy loam in many considerable patches, where water is obtainable at a depth of a few feet. The main Wadi itself is a wide depression, varying in breadth from two miles to five hundred yards, least steeply inclined on the left bank, and having a well-defined storm water course, which generally hugs its cliffy right bank. This water-PHYSICAL CHARACTER 349 course may run from six to nine feet deep after heavy rain in the western harrahs. Between Aneizah and Boreidah the sand has drifted across the depression so as to form a dam, which often holds up storm-waters for some months in a large lagoon Below this dam the bed of the depression becomes a salty, slimy clay and bears little or no vegetation. From the left bank of the wadi the ground slopes up uniformly westward, emerging above the sands as hard steppe, which runs up towards the highlands of Jebel Shammar. From the right bank the slope is more gradual, and, since there is less drainage flowing underground, the drift-sand along the edge of the wadi itself is backed by a more barren desert. II. A central region dependent on a chalky, broken-up plateau,which trends from north to south and is composed of two ridges with escarp ments facing west and long slopes falling eastward. This plateau (Jebel Toweiq or Tuweiq) has a mean elevation of about 600 feet above the general level of the plains to west of it. It admits of settled life in its hollows, and bears one of the Nejdean districts, Sedeir, almost entirely on its broad back, together with the northern half (Mahmal) of another, 'Aridh. The two ridges diverge in S. Sedeir, leaving an intramontane depression. The eastern ridge bears away SE. into desert; the western breaks down to a deep and broad gap and then, after rising again on the farther side, takes a south-westward course. The gap allows waters drained off the western face to escape through the ridge by a great valley, kn own at first as Wadi Heisiyah, and lower as Wadi Hanifah. The upper part of this valley with the lower country on each side of the broken ridge make the rest of 'Aridh, which is therefore about half and half chalky hill country and sandy valley and plain. Below the westward escarpment of Jebel Toweiq lies a plain of sandy loam sloping up gradually towards SW. and divided longi tudinally by a belt of drift-sand running N. and S. In its western part subterranean drainage collects and comes near the surface before finding its way from the northern half to Wadi Rummah, from the southern half to Wadi Heisiyah. This whole district may be called Woshm, though the name belongs particularly to the southern part only, while the northern is El-Mudhnib, and the inter vening low watershed contains a large water-logged depression known as 'Ayun es-Sirr. III. A southern region, dependent in the main on the same western ridge of the Toweiq plateau after its deflection to south- westward. Only a very small part of it has been seen by any European eye, and its physical character remains largely con-350 NEJD jectural. It may be assuihed that the eastward slope from the plateau is very gradual and long, and that the rich grazing districts of Hariq and Kharj both lie on this slope, one below the other, till it melts imperceptibly into plain and is bounded by the southern con tinuation of Wadi Hanifah. Partly on the plateau itself and partly below its westward scarp lies a third not unfertile district, Aflaj, fed by its inland drainage. To the south and south-westward of the latter lie two more districts, Saleyyil and Dawasir, but how related to Jebel Toweiq we do not know. It is certain, however, that they are fed by a wholly different sj^stem of drainage—that which, starting in the highlands of SW. Arabia, flows inland and probably is absorbed midway across the peninsula. The whole region is only intermittently fertile, and all its settlements have an oasis character ; but, internally, it contains no formidable desert, though much steppe. Ah and harrah do not occur in it at all. No part is rich, as the present Emir of Riyadh has borne witness, in pleading more than once that his inland dominions contain no district so productive as Hasa (q.v.). B. Climate The region is comparatively temperate, except, according to report, in its extreme southern districts. Harlq in particular is reported exceedingly hot, and all heard of Dawasir, coupled with the dark coloration of the Dosiri, leads us to suppose it no cooler. In Riyadh, Palgrave says a fire is welcome on winter nights, but his testimony and that of others suggest that sharp cold is not known there. On the Toweiq plateau it is different, and Qasim has a keen desert air, which would render all except its summer nights very chill, were it not for its comparatively low elevation (under 2,000 feet). It can be unpleasantly cold in spring, even in the daytime. Rainfall is, throughout, very scanty, the precipitation which the northern Nefud enjoys rarely extending south of Jebel Shammar, and the rains of the Gulf littoral, which delayed Shakespear in the Koweit district in late winter 1914, not passing Jebel Toweiq. Most of the rain which does fall in South Nejd is during summer storms. The prevailing winds are westerly, except in the extreme north of the district, where they are deflected to southerly, as shown by the altered direction of the sand-waves in the Nefud north of the lower course of Wadi Rummah.I SOCIAL 351 SOCIAL A. Population The total population may be estimated conjecturally at rather over than under a quarter of a million. No account is here taken of unsettled Bedouins, since there is only a very small nomadic element in Nejd—less than in any other Arabian region. All the known unsettled Bedouin tribes, which owe fealty to the Emir of Riyadh, range either outside the boundaries we have indicated, or for a very short distance and very occasionally within them. Such are the Ahl Murrah, B. Khalid, and 'Ajman on the east, the Qahtan on the south and south-west, and the Sebei' and Sahul on the west. Nor do independent tribes, like the Muteir on the north-east, the Sham- mar on the north, and the Ateibah on the north-west, penetrate Nejd except on occasional raids. The settled folk are, however, almost all of original Bedouin stocks—Beni Tamim and Beni Khalid in Qasim; southern Anazah, Tamim and Dawasir in Central Nejd ; and Dawasir and Qahtan in the south-west. If other tribesmen come in, it is to settle (see Chap. XVI, pp. 603 f¥.) It is to this constant homogeneity of its society that Nejd owes its common adherence to Wahabism, its unification under one sceptre, and its comparative stability and strength. B. Domestic Apparatus and Manufactures These are as simple and primitive throughout Nejd as in any other Arabian region where there is settled life. At the top of the very narrow scale stand the citizens of Aneizah in Qasim; at the bottom, the Dawasir and Saleyyil villagers. All buildings are of sun-dried clay, with walls thinning upwards, except in the southernmost villages, where the construction material is palm-branch. Roofs are flat, and made of clay laid on palm- fronds or tamarisk branches, which are supported by palm-beams. Windows are represented only by triangular light- or smoke-holes. Each house has a court or yard used for keeping domestic animals, depositing dung, &amp;c. Privies are very rare—the yard, roof, street, or even a room being used. Two-storeyed houses are exceptional. Furniture—even a fitted divan frame—is virtually unknown. Men sit and sleep on palm-fibre mats, and half the floor will be bare and deep in dust. A shallow depression with a clay rim serves as a hearth. For dishes and plates small palm-leaf mats are used. No implements for carrying food to the mouth are known.352 NEJD Artificial light is seldom provided : only rich men possess badlv made petroleum lamps, imported from the Gulf. Cooking utensils are of copper, badly tinned, and of very simple forms. Except in Qasim these are seldom of native manufacture Only very rude ' kitchen ' pottery is made in Nejd. Bread is baked in flat pancakes either on the ashes themselves, or (in richer houses) on an iron tray. Except in Qasim towns and the largest urban centres of S. Nejd there is no metallurgy : and even in those cooking-pots of copper, and other very simple vessels and necessaries alone are made. Coffee-pots come from Hasa, daggers and knives from Ha'il or the Gulf, and firearms exclusively from abroad. These last are adapted by the owners to their use by knocking off the sights, paring down the stock, hammering in decorative nails, &amp;c. They soon become foul, being seldom or never cleaned. As for clothing materials, all are imported except the coarse woollen cloth used for abbas, and the woollen head-cords. Camel- hair cloth for tents and saddlebags is manufactured locally, but with only a monochrome stripe. Better class abbas come from Hasa. No underclothes except a cotton shirt are worn. Foot-covering is not very generally worn, and leather articles are almost all imported, except the simplest utensils of ill-tanned hide, e.g. water-skins and buckets (used in irrigation), skin robes of some nomads, and rude saddles, sandals, holsters, &amp;c. Very little basket- or reed-work is produced beside mats and fans. There is some improvement on this standard of production in Qasim, especially in Aneizah; but even there the technique and output are much below those of Gulf ports, e.g. Koweit, and the apparatus of the household is of the simplest. Throughout Nejd the food-stufis do not go beyond milk, ghi, dates, and bread, as staples, and rice and mutton as luxuries. C. Trade There is almost nothing to treat under this head, except in respect of one district, Qasim. This produces a superfluity of dates and ghi, but in the last commodity trades more as middleman than producer, collecting from the Bedouin herdsmen of the western and northern steppes. At one time it used to_breed horses for export, but (as also in Central Nejd, Woshm and 'Aridh) the production of these has almost ceased as a result of the wars between Ha'il and Riyadh during the past half-century. But if Qasim does not produce much, it trades in the products of others more than any other Arabian district. Doughty heard in 1878 that more than a third of its population acted as carriers, andi SOCIAL 353 hirers-out of camel-transport. Hence the society of the whole district, and especially its towns, has an exceptionally commercial and cosmopolitan character. (See pp. 370 ff.) In the rest of Nejd comparatively little caravan traffic seems to go on. Leachman heard in 1912 that trade had declined to almost nothing in Riyadh; but Shaqrah, though not what it was, seems still to be a trading centre. There is said to be regular traffic between Riyadh and the south-western districts of the penin sula by way of Wadi Dawasir, but what its measure and character may be is not known. D. Curbency The only currency in common use in Nejd is the silver dollar {riydl) ; but when the Emirs' dues and the Meccan contributions have been paid very few coins remain in circulation. There are no smaller denominations except stray Turkish pieces, and these are accepted only in Qasim. In S. Nejd even Turkish gold, in current circulation in Hasa, is taken very reluctantly. Persian currency, and the rupee, though common on the Gulf Coast, do not pass in Nejd, except, possibly, with big merchants of Qasim towns or of Shaqrah, and at heavy discount. Doughty, however, got for a cheque in Aneizah. Ordinary exchange is effected by barter in kind calculated on a basis of date-fruits, measured by the Sa' (see below). E. Weights and Measures Dates are measured by weight, says Doughty, at Aneizah, but what weights are used as a standard he does not say. Leachman reports Indian weights and measures to be used at Shaqrah, but gives no details. (Compare Indian scales used at Muscat, p. 244.) Doughty (1877) found a measure of content, the Sah or (of Medina), in use as the basis of trade in dry commodities throughout W. Central Arabia. He says it varies according to locality, being equivalent to nearly 2 pints at Teima; 2| a.t Ha'il; nearly 3 at el-'Ala ; and 5 at Kheibar. He gave the following table :— 12 Sahs = 1 Medega (a small palm-basket). 5 Medegas = 1 Mejellad. ? Mejellads = l Hashiah (i.e. a skinful of dates. Lorimer {Gazetteer of the Persian 1908) gave the following information for both South Nejd and Qasim: ' Wholesale weights are arabia i r?354 NEJD the Wazndh = 52 dollars in silver coin, or about 31b. 1 oz. 6 dr. English avoirdupois, and the Mann = 40 or about 123 lb! 6 oz. 12 dr. Wholesale weighments are generally made with a sort of steelyard. For retail transactions dry and liquid measures of capacity are employed, which are really weights in disguise. ... The standard sizes of bowl are the Mi which holds a Waznah, and the Sd', which holds two ; but quarters, fifths, sixths, and eighths of Sa's are also employed. This is in tabular form :— 1 Waznah = 1 Midd. 2 Waznahs or Midds = 1 Sah 40 Waznahs or Midds | _ j Mann , 20 Sahs The unit of lineal measure, he adds, is the DJmT = 19| inches. POLITICAL Recent History and Present Politics _A11 Nejd acknowledges at present the Sa'ud dynasty of Riyadh in 'Aridh. The latter's jurisdiction is enforced directly by accredited representatives in 'Aridh, Sedeir, and probably Kharj, and also in parts of Aflaj, Woshm, Qasim (e.g. Boreidah), and probably Hariq: i indirectly, in the other parts of these latter districts, in the towns of Aneizah and Mejma', and probably in Saleyyil and Dawasir. Each town has its emir or governor and its or council, but only in Aneizah of Qasim have we heard of the council having much power. Hereditary emirs are not uncommon even in directly administered districts, and they seem to be the rule in the outlying quarters of the south, where, as in parts of Woshm also, the settle ments are free except for a tributary obligation. The origin of the present power of Riyadh has been stated in Chap. II. It suffered eclipse at the hands of the Shammar Emirs of Ha'il from th^ middle of the eighties of last century until 1902, the representatives of the Sa'ud family being reduced after 1891 to puppets, w r hile Rashidite governors took charge of all the impor tant settlements in Qasim, Sedeir, 'Aridh, and Woshm. This state of things was terminated by 'Abd el-'Aziz es-Sa'ud, who had remained in exile at Koweit with his father, 'Abd er-Rahman, until he heard j that his uncle, the mediatized Emir, had been murdered by Ibn Rashid's orders. With only about forty followers he appeared in Sedeir, raised part of that district and marched on 'Aridh, where he . had no difficulty in surprising and removing the Rashidite governorPOLITICAL 355 of Riyadh. His father stood aside and accepted his son as Emir. Acknowledged by all the southern provinces, 'Abd el-'Aziz marched on Qasim in 1904, and though forced to retire thence by a Turkish force sent under Ahmed Feizi Pasha to co-operate with the Emir of Ha'il, he returned in 1906, and has held that district to tribute, and partially in direct subjection, ever since, but not without frequent skirmishes with the forces of Jebel Shammar. In 1910 he had to meet both an internal and an external danger. Certain grandsons of his late uncle, Sa'ud, claiming the throne for the elder branch, tried to raise Kharj and Hariq. At the same time 'Abdullah, son of the Grand Sherif, appeared in Qasim, professing to champion the rights of the Ateibah violated by 'Abd el-'Aziz. The latter's younger brother, Sa'd, his representative in Qasim, was made prisoner; but finding that the Emir of Ha'il, who had lately made peace with 'Abd el-'Aziz, did not co-operate, 'Abdullah retired stipu lating that the Qasim towns contribute to the Meccan treasury a sum of £4,000 annually (the larger towns had previously paid ' Peter's pence' voluntarily), and be free to elect their own governors. 'Abd el-'Aziz assented to these terms. The southern rebels had no success, and after being driven from town to town, fled out of Nejd. For harbouring some of them, 'Abd el-'Aziz inflicted heavy punish ment on the Ateibah a year later, in violation of his convention with the Sherif. Hard pressed for resources, he had been coveting Hasa, which before 1871 pertained to his dynasty, and he had tried, without much success, to enlist the support of the Indian Govern ment, seeking to revive an agreement which had subsisted between his uncle, the Emir 'Abdullah, and ourselves in regard to Gulf matters. The Balkan War and the internal dissensions of the Rashid house at last offered him an opportunity, and the presence of rebel grandsons of Sa'ud at Hofuf an excuse : and early in 1913 he descended on Hasa, captured the central oasis, and ten days later took Qatif. He sent the Turkish governor and garrisons down to 'Oqair, whence they made their way into El-Qatar. In the following year he had a conference with two representatives of the Indian Government, and, after a show of negotiating with the Ottoman Power and accepting the title ' Vali of Nejd', he invited a British agent to his court, and declared for us and against Ibn Rashid, the ally of the Turks. The latter advanced early in 1915 into Sedeir, but retired after fighting a drawn battle near Mejma', in the course of which our newly arrived agent, Captain Shakespear, was unfortunately killed. In the early autumn the Grand Sherif, who shelters rebel grandsons of Sa'ud, again sent up 'Abdullah, with a considerable force, to mediate between the Z2356 NEJD two Emirs and at the same time to enforce the pact of 1910 especially its financial clause. A peace was patched up (it has not been long observed), and the Sherif's son retired, leaving some sore ness behind. In 1916 'Abd el-'Aziz, who had been having serious trouble with the 'Ajman in Hasa, sent his son from Qasim to raid almost up to Ha'il; and he has continually been harrying Ibn Rashid. His present attitude is opportunist. He subscribes to the Arab Unionist party, headed by the Sherif, but disparages the latter and allows the Turks to procure camels from his territory. At the same time he does his best to be on terms with the Indian Government and has, lately, concluded a definite treaty with it, of the same kind as those in force with the Gulf potentates. He keeps his grip on Hasa and Qasim. DISTRICTS The internal boundaries of the nine Districts, though undelimited, appear to be immutable ; but their external boundaries lying in desert admit of no precision. I. 'A ridh The central district, geographically and politically. It has Sedeir on the north beyond the sha'lb El-'Aj sh : Dahanah desert on the east; Kharj and Hariq on the south beyond Jebel Alayyah; Aflaj on the SW.: and Woshm on the NW. and west. The part of 'Aridh which contains permanent settlements is a square of about 100 miles with the capital, Riyadh, lying towards the SE. corner. Physically, 'Aridh is the central part of the Toweiq system. The heart of the district is the valley of Heisiyah-Hanifah. On the south-west, beyond the western ridge, lies a plain, Dhrumah, sparsely inhabited and containing some villages, but no towns, unless Dhrumah itself be reckoned a town because of its 1,500 inhabitants and its small suq. On the western ridge itself, north of Hanifah, lies a subdistrict called Mahmal, well settled on the west where wadis drain through it to the left bank of Heisiyah. On the east of the same ridge, in the intramontane depression, known as Khafs, is another sparsely settled district, containing only hamlets. The eastern ridge and the plain district of 'Urmah beyond it again are not settled, but contain a few wells which facilitate passage to Hasa and Koweit. Only away to NE. lies a single isolated patch of two or three hamlets in a district known as Safurrah. -The strength of 'Aridh lies therefore in the subdistricts, Hanifah and Mahmal, which, between them, hold over 90 per cent, of its fixed population. Here is the heart and spring of Wahabism, andDISTRICTS 357 here, in one town or another, has always resided the chief political power controlling Ncjd. The principal villages are noticed along Routes Nos. 15 and 16 (q.v.). The towns, arranged under the two districts Hanifah and Mahmal, are :— i. Hanif 1. Riyadh, capital of Nejd, since the destruction of Dar'iyah in 1818. It lies in a depression about 100 feet below the general level of the plain {riyddh = 'green hollows'), and from north or east is not seen till at short range. It is enclosed by date gardens on three sides, and with these and its suburbs it stretches about two miles from north to south, where it impinges on the valley-bottom of Wadi Hanifah, locally called El-Batin. The actual town is 'L' shaped, with high mud-brick walls strengthened by towers, pro tected by a ditch, and pierced by six fortified gates. The ruling Emir's palace, a huge structure, stands S. of a large central space, open to NE., with the principal mosque on the W. and shops on the N. According to Shakespear, the palaces of the ruling family, renewed since Ibn Rashid's occupation (1891-1902), and their gardens occupy about one-third of the town. There are four wards. NE. live notables; SW. the middle classes; SE. (Khaziq) the poor. To the NW. are relegated outsiders and all who are not of the strict Wahabite persuasion; and on this side lie the cemeteries through which runs the main track leading up Wadi Hanifah-Heisiyah to the north and west (Mecca). Entering the town by the E. gate, at the top of the L, the visitor follows a wide and sandy street flanked at intervals by large two- storeyed houses, built since the Rashidite occupation. Their blank outer walls and wide division one from another by palm gardens and courts, with similarly blank walls, give this street rather an empty appearance. It conducts direct to the open space in which the palace is situated near the angle of the L. To reach the same point from the west, any one coming from Wadi Hanifah must pass through a number of quiet by-streets and then through the market. The large open space north of the palace will then lie east. Here the mejlis is held and public prayer is performed under the leadership of the Emir himself ; and here camels collect. But when a military expedition is toward, the place of assembly is the great plain outside the town on the north. The chief date gardens lie outside on the south and west in Wadi Hanifah, and the irrigation of these is effected by animal-traction, buckets dipping358 NEJD into wells some of which are of considerable diameter, lined with unmortared ashlar and from 40 to 80 feet deep. Raunkiaer saw one at which eight donkeys were working. But there are gardens also within the walls, and these with the large courtyards and the vast palatial buildings occupy so much space that the population of the town is disproportionate to its area. Estimates of it have varied very much. Leachman heard in 1912 that the town contained 20,000 inhabitants, and that 7,000 men had attended prayer at the Great Festival. If so, a consider able proportion in all probability were not townsmen but Bedouins or other outsiders attending on a special occasion; and Leachman, during his visit, actually saw only about 300 at prayer. Lorimer, since he puts the whole population of the Wadi Hanifah subdistriot (inclusive of Riyadh) at only 15,000, must estimate the urban body much lower (8,000). Perhaps 10,000 is not far wrong, the truth lying rather under than over. Wahabism is all-powerful in Riyadh. The score of mosques are all unpretentious, with minarets only a few feet high. Attendance at prayer is enforced by the rod, the bazaars being closed five times every day. But there has been some relaxation of the severity practised in the early nineteenth century. Gay-coloured head- scarves and robes are now commonly worn by the townsmen, and coffee, and on occasion less permitted beverages, are indulged in. The Emir is considered lax in observance, amusing himself with a gramophone in camp. 2. Dar'iyah (Deraya), a town of about 1,000 inhabitants, built on the N. side of Wadi Hanifah, opposite the ruins of the old capital destroyed in 1818. It lies about 12 miles W. of Riyadh, and has immense date gardens, irrigated from 40-foot wells. One quarter, Tareif, lies across the Wadi: the other two, and Ghaslbah, are separately walled. ii. Mahmal 3. Sedus is a small town situated in Toweiq in Wadi Wutar, a left-bank affluent of Heisiyah and near the head of another water course which follows a remarkable natural depression due south to' Ayeinah about 23 miles ESE. • Pelly, in 1865, found it a ' cheerful neat-looking town embosomed in date-groves with many wells . Raunkiaer in 1912 reported it (as seen from outside the walls) a well-fortified town in a particularly well-kept oasis. It has two quarters, upper and lower, the latter, owing to floods, now halt abandoned. The place seems to be rather an agglomeration otf c ■ - - . ' DISTRICTS 359 hamlets with small central fort than a town proper, and it has about 800 inhabitants. It is reputed unhealthy. It is far-famed for a broken free-standing column three feet in diameter and about 20 feet high, supposed to be pre-Islamic, and inscribed on the lower part with two Greek crosses. It was thrown down by the Wahabites after 1865, but has been set up again. 4. Hareimlah, in a considerable oasis about 12 miles NNW. of Sedus, is also in Toweiq but almost on the watershed and at the head of the Abu Kithadah depression which drains to Wadi Wutar. Shakespear found it a considerable place of about 2,500 inhabitants, who cultivate large fields and fruit gardens in the depression, irrigating from deep wells by donkey-traction. A large ruined fort, built by the Egyptians early in the last century within the walls at the lower end of the town, is now ruined, and the place contains much other ruin and seems to have declined. There is a small suq. The main road N. from Riyadh to Sedeir passes this way. 5 and 6. Jarinah and Malham are townlets beyond (E. of) Hareimlah on the eastward slope of western Toweiq, the last being at the foot, 15 miles from Hareimlah. They hold, respectively, 1,250 and 1,500 inhabitants. Both have considerable, but not luxuriant, date gardens. Water is obtained at both places at depths from 50 to 90 feet according to season. Malham consists of two separate villages about a mile apart, largely inhabited by settled Beni Khalid, and owns the larger area of cultivation. 7. Thadiq (pronounced Thddij or a small town of about 1,500 inhabitants, lies in a large oasis in a side valley of the west ward Toweiq slope NW. of Hareimlah. II. Khahj (or Yemamah) The district SE. of 'Aridh, into which Wadi Hanifah runs away, is called by one of the above names and its capital by the other ; but there is some doubt which is which. The mediaeval geographers and all moderns until lately regarded Yemamah as the district name, but the most recent authorities transpose the two. The district extends, in any case, from the right bank of Wadi Hanifah, just below Riyadh, to the Great South Desert, and from the borders of Hariq and Hautah (q. v.) on the south-west to the Eastern Desert. Its habitable area may be about 80 miles N. to S., by 50 W. to E. Except the extreme north, no part of it has ever been seen by a European. We know only that it includes grazing country where the Emirs of Riyadh keep their stock, at about two days' march from their capital. It is also said (both360 NEJD Pelly in 1865 and Leachman in 1912 were so informed at RivarlM to contain running springs and large date-groves. According to Pa grave it is the most populous and the richest of the Neidean districts. But he spoke from hearsay only. Physicallv it should t a u' Sc ]i y i P111 0r down countr y 5 in the north-eastern part of de l )resslon of Wadi Hanifah runs out into the Desert OI oS/JLlS/Dctil. The once considerable town of Manfuhah is on its extreme northern edge over against Riyadh, but its other towns lie in a group some 50 miles to the south and not far from the Southern Desert. Pre- sumably the fall of the land is southward and eastward and there is a depression (Wadi Breik) which collects the drainage from Toweiq after it has passed Hariq (q. v.). A running stream, called Ferzan, feeds the group. Its towns are reported to be :— 1. Manfuhah, in Wadi Hanifah, on the northern edge, visited by oadiier in 1819 and reported by him to contain 2,000 families (i e about 10,000 inhabitants) and to have good mud and stone houses' often two storeys high. The fortification wall had been newly razed! and the ditch filled up. Since Riyadh was then only a village, Manfu hah was probably more populous than now ; but it is still said to possess 30,000 date-trees, and a moderate stock of camels, horses, donkeys, and cattle. Its wells vary from 25 to 70 feet in depth according to their distance from Wadi Hanifah. • ( or Salamiyah), a small place of only about 500 inhabitants, lies on the Perzan stream flowing from Dilam (q. v.) (Pelly heard in 1865 it was actually on Wadi Hanifah). It is about 50 miles SSE. of Riyadh. It has also abundant well-water at about 35 feet depth, and cultivates large gardens. It possesses some 300 camels and other stock (not horses). • if' ^ es p^ose by on the same stream. It has about 750 inhabitants, and similar well-water and gardens. It is said to occupy the site of the early town of its name, which was once the capital of the most important central Arabian state. 4. Dilam (or Kharj), the present chief town of the District, lies about 8 miles WSW. up the same stream. It is walled and has ^ e i.' War( ^ S ' Samhdn, Tuwdlah, and (30 shops) and about 5,000 inhabitants, who cultivate large gardens and fields, growing even nee. The wells vary from 35 to 50 feet in depth. Ibn Sa'ud's governor occupies a fort inside the walls. There are some 600 camels and other stock.DISTRICTS 361 III. H abiq— H autah Whether these are two districts or one, under either, or some other name, and whether, if two, the districts properly bear these names, which are certainly those also of their chief towns, are open questions. No European has ever visited this part of Nejd, and our scanty information is conflicting. This district certainly lies west of Kharj and south of 'Aridh. Whether it fills all the interval between the south-western part of the latter (Jebel 'Aleyyah) and the Great South Desert, and what lies to west of it depend on the position we assign to Aflaj (q.v.). Roughly the area may be put at about 50 miles each way, the central point being about the intersection of lat. 24° N. with long. 46° E. We may guess the district to lie on a higher shelf than Kharj, below (east of) the main ridge of Toweiq, or, perhaps, to be a valley in the eastern part of the plateau itself. It is divided into north and south by a ridge, Jebel Hileyyah, but the drainage from both parts joins E. of this ridge and flows into Kharj by Wadi Breik. But, beyond the fact that the district contains two considerable towns, and produces unusually fine dates and other fruits, we know little of it. 1. Hariq, the northernmost town, lies 50 miles south of Riyadh, and some 40 miles west of Dilam under the SW. slope of Jebel 'Aleyyah, which seems to be an eastward outlier of the main Toweiq. It is reported to have 3,000 inhabitants, many living outside the walls, and a suq with 40 shops. Its well-water lies deep (100 feet). It possesses few horses and donkeys, but a considerable herd of horned cattle and some 500 camels. The rebel grandsons of Sa'ud first raised their rebellion here in 1910. 2. Hautah (= Palace), a walled town, lies about one short day's journey south of Hariq. Pelly heard that it was the southernmost town of Nejd, eight days' march from the northernmost, Zilfi in Sedeir. Hautah is said to have 4,000 inhabitants, a of 80 shops, and large gardens and fields irrigated by camel-power from wells as deep as those of Hariq. It has about the same amount of stock as the latter. It also was a scene of rebellion in 1910, The Emir is a local man deputed by Ibn Sa'ud to rule all the district. Since the town itself is known as Hillah, it is possible that Hautah is really the district name. 3. Hilwah, near by on the S., has about 1,500 inhabitants and very large gardens.362 NEJD IV. Aplaj According to Palgrave, who states that he made an excursion in 1862 to Kharfah, this district is conterminous with 'Aridh. He says that he crossed Wadi Hanifah and reached the boundary of Aflaj at the village of Safra in one easy day's ride from Riyadh. He heard at Kharfah, which he reached in another long day, that the district of Dawasir began one moderate day's journey to south again, He found the water-courses to fall southward and away from Wadi Hanifah after he had gone some miles over a broken calcareous plateau (Toweiq). Though he nowhere explicitly states the relation of Aflaj to Kharj, it is clear that he placed it west of the latter, and north of Hariq, Saleyyil, and Dawasir, all these being bounded on the south again by the Great Desert. _ According to Lorimer, however, Aflaj is not conterminous with 'Aridh at all, but divided from it by Hariq. The only point of agreement is its relation to Dawasir. Kharfah, thus, will be placed over 150 miles SSW. from Riyadh. Pending further information, we prefer Palgrave's position for Aflaj to Lorimer's, and place it south-west of 'Aridh, with Dawasir, Saleyyil, and the Maqran depression on its own south-west and south, and Hariq on the east. Palgrave's estimate would make its length from NE. to SW. not much above 50 miles. Fortunately, in their descriptions of the general character of the district, Lorimer and Palgrave are not inconsistent. Physically, Aflaj would appear to consist of scrubby and broken hill country on north and west, containing several villages. It sends down its drainage to a plain country on the east and south, containing the most fertile lands and the most considerable settle ments. Aflaj, therefore, lies partly in and on the southern Toweiq plateau, which sends off a spur, called Jebel Birk, to divide it from Hariq. All authorities agree that there is a good deal of spring water in the district, both in the hills and in the western part of the plain; that the settlements have gardens of date and other fruit trees, these being most luxuriant in the hill villages; and that it holds a considerable settled population. The settlements above village rank are reported to be 1. Kharfah, in the eastern plain, known as Aflaj proper. It was the chief town and seat of the Emir's representative when visited by Palgrave in 1862, and was estimated by him to contain 8,000 souls. But native report now reduces this total to 750 and no longer ascribes to it the capital position. It lies in a sandy plain amid sparse palms, has a main ward, and some detached groups of settlement, and is walled. Water is abundant from wellsDISTRICTS 363 40 to 50 feet deep, but the gardens are comparatively small. The inhabitants are partly Beni Khadhir (low-caste cultivators of very dark tint), partly Dawasir, the latter being the landowners and fanatically Wahabite. 2. Badi', in the extreme south of the district, has two quarters, Batinah and Taraf, separated by date-groves, a small fort, and about 3,000 inhabitants drawn from the same constituent elements as at Kharfah. There are very large date gardens and fields, watered from wells 30 to 40 feet deep. 3. Raudhah, ten miles north of Badi' and about three south of Kharfah, has about 1,200 inhabitants, and large palm-groves. Its well-water lies at over 40 feet depth. It possesses considerable stock in camels and cattle, but no horses. An extensive sur rounding arable region depends on it. 4. Leilah, in the north of the district, appears now to be the largest settlement in Afiaj ; but it is rather a group of villages than a town. It has 4,500 inhabitants, of whom some 350 are Ashraf. Ifs wells are deep, 36 to 60 feet. 5. Seih, some four miles south-east of Leilah, is another group of villages or isolated wards, which has 6,000 inhabitants. Its gardens are unusually large and well planted, and its wells unusually shallow (under 10 feet). There are some 250 Ashraf residents, besides the usual Dawasir and Khadhir, In summer its population is increased by some 2,000 Dawasir. 6. Hamar lies in the hill-country about twenty miles W. of Seih. Large date and fruit groves. Population about 2,500. The gardens of Wasit, farther down the valley, which runs to Seih, are owned by the Dawasir of Hamar. V. Saleyyil This district lies south-east of Dawasir and of the Maqran depres sion, which is uninhabited but not unproductive. On the south of it, behind a chain of heights, extends the Great Desert. It is hilly in part and drains to the SE., but beyond the fact that it is a sandy tract and that it contains about a dozen hamlets, all poor and savage, nothing is known about it. By some it is regarded as a sub-district of Dawasir. VI. DAWASItt This district, more strictly to be called Wadyan (or Widyan) Dawasir, lies to the south-west of Aflaj and the west of Saleyyil, and,364 NEJD according to Palgrave, begins within twenty miles of Kharfah town What is known about it is all hearsay. It has always been spoken of as one long wadi with, apparently, tributaries coming into it at a central point. At this point settlements are grouped thickly round a central town called Dam. As for its extent, Palgrave heard at Kharfah that Dawasir was 200 miles in length. Leachman (1912) was told in Riyadh that a route lay down Wadi Dawasir to Bishah (East Asir) which could be covered in eight days' fast travelling. (Doughty however, was informed twelve days.) The distance between these points (crow-fly) is a little more than 400 miles. If we assume (following Palgrave) that the first part of this route lies through Aflaj, of which the farther border is from 90 to 100 miles SW. of Riyadh, and, further, assume that its final stages lie in country beyond Dawasir, we can accept the intervening 200 miles as Wadyan Dawasir itself. It is practically certain that the fall of the drainage of Wadi Dawasir is from SW. to NE., and that it is lost ultimately in sands. Leachman says it rises ' on the eastern slopes of the plateau of Asir', and evidently he believed it to be a continuation of Wadi Bishah. This, too, seems to have been the belief of Tamisier and Chedufau, who heard news of it from the Asir side during the Egyptian Expedition in the thirties of the nineteenth Century, But it is not safe to assume such to be the fact. The statement made to Leach man (see above) that there is a route by Dawasir to Ranyah (or Wadi Sabai') or Bishah does not necessarily mean that this route all lies in one wadi: and, equally, we know, on both mediaeval and modern authority, that there is a route by Dawasir to Nejran, whose waters, carried along Wadi Habunah, were reported to Halevy, at Nejran itself in 1870, to flow into Wadi Dawasir. (Leachman's informant denied this, saying the Nejran water is independent and goes through Wadi ' Aftana' orAftan into the Great Desert.) In any case, it appears that the main nucleus of the Dawasir province lies well away from any known part of either Wadi Bishah or Wadi Habunah, but nearest (150 miles) to the former. There are here some 14 or 15 well-watered settlements, among extensive palm-groves. It was also told to Doughty that palm-groves extend through Dawasir for about 140 miles, and to Leachman that these are prolonged all the way from Seih (? the place of that name in Aflaj) to Ranyah in Asir. On the left hand (south) lies continuous desert. The population is said to be fanatical, secretive, and barbarous, a woman requiring her man to have killed seven enemies before enjoying her favours. But it supplies the caravans, which are reported to pass up the wadi regularly. The poorer folk do notjg/ \ I. J DISTRICTS 365 build their habitations of anything more permanent than palm-leaf and palm-fibre, but they cultivate both cereals and fruits. The population is in some degree subject to the Emir of Riyadh, but how numerous it may be is uncertain. It has, however, bred in sufficient numbers to overflow Aflaj, and to contribute an element to the population of other districts, e. g. 'Aridh, Woshm, Hariq, and even Hasa and Bahrein. Dam, in the centre of WadyanDawasir, is the capital of the whole district, its Emir not only ruling the town, in nominal dependence on Ibn Sa'ud, but having some authority over all Dawasiri villages, though each of these is, in a measure, self-governing. The of Dam is arbiter in their disputes. The town is reported a walled place with four gates, two quarters, and Shawd'iq (E.), and two suqs, joined by a street which is the meat-market. The Emir's palace (Qasr el-Haseyyin) is in the E. quarter. There are four mosques. The houses are said to be well built and some to be two-storeyed. The inhabitants have been estimated at 5,000, all Wahabite Dawasir, who own large gardens, watered from 30-foot wells, and many camels, do a good deal of trade, and exercise various handicrafts, including rifle-repairing, cartridge-filling, and sword-blade forging. There seem to be no other settlements that can fairly be called towns in Dawasir, though there are some very big villages, e.g. Aseil, about 10 miles W. of Dam, walled, with 2,500 inhabitants but no siiq ; Mishrif, quite near Dam on the N., with a large suq and 1,750 inhabitants ; Ma 'talah, SE. of Dam, 1,500 inhabitants ; Hanabijah, NE. of Dam (20 miles), 1,000 inhabitants ; Quweiz, about 10 miles SE. of Dam, 1,500 inhabitants ; Thamamiyah, 20 miles E. of Dam, 1,750 inhabitants ; and Nazwah, 15 miles NE. of Dam, 1,000 inhabitants. All of these have large date plantations and abundant, but not always good, water. VII. Woshm Here we return to better-known ground. This district (if we include in it, for convenience, all the country as far as the_northern limit of Mudhnib) lies well out from Jebel Toweiq, with 'Aridh and Sedeir on its south and east and Qasim on the north. The boundary of Qasim lies about midway between Mudhnib and Qufiziyah (Kufizie), On the west Woshm fades away into the great Ateibah steppe, and on the south a belt of desert (Hammadah) divides it from the Dhrumah district of 'Aridh. Its whole area is about 100 miles N. to S. by somewhat less E. to W.366 NEJD Physically it is all more or less plain. Leachman describes it as a strip of sandy loam bounded on the east by Toweiq, and undefined on the west. Down the middle of it runs a narrow elevated band of nefud, which is bounded by a cliffy slope on the west, about 200 feet high. Into this sand the western part drains, the water soaking down either southward to the Dhrumah district of 'Aridh, or northward and eastward into the Rummah system. The watershed seems to be a low sandy strip about 15 miles wide, crossed on the road from Shaqrah to 'Ayun es-Sirr, East of the longitudinal nefud there appears to be another loamy belt called Jareifah, lying under the western scarp of Toweiq, which is reported to contain at least one considerable settlement^ Washeiqir ; but, except in the extreme SE. corner, on the roads from Shaqrah to Thadiq in Sedeir, and to W. Heisiyah and Riyadh, this eastern part of Woshm (by some reckoned to Sedeir) has not been seen. The nefud ends south of the town of Tharmidah, and at its termination the boundary between Woshm and 'Aridh is placed. In the SE. Woshm is described as an almost park-like countiy with scattered farms and hamlets, and two fairly considerable towns, Shaqrah, the capital, and Tharmidah. But in the centre and north it is evidently a leaner land. The basin of Shaqrah is bounded on N. and E. by stony arid country, after which comes the large depression of Ayun es-Sirr, 30 miles from S. to N. It has no drainage outlet and is often waterlogged, but its wells and springs are brackish. Still, wherever the loamy soil belt shows, Woshm is not unfertile and carries, even in Ayun es-Sirr, a succession of hamlets, often more properly to be described as large farms consisting of a qasr, or fortified residence of a landowner, surrounded by huts of his dependants and cultivators. Such, for example, is the so-called ' village ' of Murabba' between Ayun es-Sirr and Mudhnib, which, in reality, consists of no more than three small and widely separated qasrs in a green hollow of the steppe. The population is said to consist mainly of Tamim (as in Qasim) and Anazah, and to be a sturdy warlike folk, not fanatical, and of independent spirit. The great Ateibah tribe (Berqah section) raids into it from the west. The total of settled folk may be estimated at perhaps 12,000. They inhabit some twenty large villages and towns, besides numerous hamlets and isolated farmsteads. The settlements of town rank seem to be four only:— 1. Shaqrah, lying towards the SE. corner. It was visited in 1912 by Leachman, and in 1914 by Shakespear. They ascribe to it from 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants. The walls, with their towers and four gates, lie largely in ruins since its long siege (45 days) byDISTRICTS 367 Mohammed ibn Rashid in 1891. The gardens are small for the size of the place, the wells being deep (60 to 70 feet), though unfailing even in droughts. Leachman found it a better built, cleaner, and more prosperous place than any other in Nejd, and its governor (of a local Beni Zeid family) an enlightened, hospitable man. There is a large su(/ where Indian currency and weights are in use. At one time the place did a considerable export trade in horses with India. It was captured by the Egyptians in 1818 and visited by Sadlier a year later. The latter was more impressed by its gardens than the most recent visitors have been. 2. Tharmidah, south-east of Shaqrah, is a considerable place much ruined by the punishment meted out to it in 1903 by the present Emir of Riyadh, after it had sided with Ibn Rashid. It has now 1,000 inhabitants, a large fort, a small and many well- built houses. The gardens, watered by deep wells (50 to 60 feet) are extensive. 3. Mudhnib, in the north centre on the main road from Shaqrah to Qasim and, strictly, not in Woshm but in a separate district of its own name, is an agglomeration of villages rather than a town, but of considerable population (2,000). It is an undesirable place with salty wells and surly inhabitants, having scattered plantations and qasrs dependent on it. It is poor in camels and other stock, 4. Washeiqir, a town reported to lie in the eastern part, between the central nefdd strip and the face of Toweiq, and a few miles NE. of Shaqrah. It has not been visited, but is said to be walled, to have three mosques, a small siiq, and large plantations, watered by wells 50 to 60 feet deep. VIII. Sedeir The northernmost district of Nejd proper. It has on the N. and NW. Qasim, the boundary lying in desert about 20 miles S. of the Rummah valley between Zilfi and Shamasiyah or Mudhnib ; on the W. is Woshm, the boundary being either at the foot of Jebel Toweiq or on the edge_of the nefud strip some distance out on the west ; on the S. lies 'Aridh, the boundary being Sha'ib el-'Ajsh, south of 'Audah and W. of Thadiq; on the E. extends the Dahanah desert. The whole area may be estimated roughly at about 100 miles N. to S. by about 90 W. to E. Physically Sedeir is the northern part of the Toweiq system, including the beginning of the range which forks towards SE., with the intramontane region and the desert for a short distance on either hand. Its main part is the single elevated plateau in the north above368 NEJD the fork of the south-eastward range, and its principal settled area is a slightly depressed strip down the centre of this plateau which includes the heads of several sha'l or water-courses, which mostly take a direction from SW. to NE., following a slight depression between the western and eastern ridges. These wadis are divided one from another by stony steppe, and the villages are all isolated oases. There are also spots of settlement out on the eastern ed^e of the plateau, both in the north to the east of Zilfl and Meima' and also in the south in the upper part of the fork. Though the central depression carries a series of flourishing villages, it offers so narrow and intermittent a habitable strip, and there is so little settled life outside it, that the number of settlements is small compared to the whole area of the district. Shakespear was informed in' 1914 that Sedeir contained no more than eighteen villages altogether. We may put the population of the whole eighteen settlements at a little under 20,000. All the villages of any importance lie on a main route, dealt with later (see Route No. 16). Among them the following seem to be reckoned towns :— 1. Mejma', in the north, situated on the S. side of a wadi running into the Mishqar valley. The levy of the whole district marches under its banner, and like Aneizah in Qasim it is autonomous, choosing its own emir but paying tribute to Ibn Sa'ud, under the agreement by which it surrendered to the latter after a very long resistance in 1906. Its sympathies were, and are, Rashidite. Its population is about 3,500. It is walled, and has a castle or tower on a knoll to the west. The wells vary from 35 to 70 feet in depth, and are precarious. The sug has 50 shops. The date- gardens are large, and the Emir occupies a house near the walls, finely enough built and decorated to be called palatial according to Nejd standards. 2. Zilfi, sometimes reckoned to Qasim and sometimes neither to that district nor to Sedeir, lies in the extreme north, in a plain (1,800 ft.) enclosed between Toweiq E. and N. and high dunes W. Palgrave (1862) described it as a single wealthy and commercial town, but Shakespear (1914) found it split into two walled towns, Shamaliyah, on the NW.—the older town—and Jumbra on the E., which he was told had formerly been joined. The first stands out in the bare plain; the other in extensive gardens, about 1 mile distant, Raunkiaer (1912) visited only the first and heard of the other as a suburb. The local Emir lives in Shamaliyah, which Raun- kiaer estimated as a quadrangle with sides from 250 to 300 metres in length. The mud walls are about 16 feet high, with three towersDISTRICTS 369 on the east, one each on north and south, and one west, pierced by the only large gate. All towers are about 10 feet higher than the walls, and loopholed; but the wall is only crenellated. The gate is both wide and high enough for a camel-rider, and has a high threshold. The NE. quarter is ruined and waste ; in the rest streets run N. and S., with lanes crossing at right angles. There are few two-storeyed houses, and only one very low and simple mosque-minaret. Jumbra is smaller and newer. The gardens are large and enclosed by high walls ; irrigation is by animal traction from wells from 40 to 60 feet deep. The sand encroaches on the cultivation from W., and there is much spoilt ground. The popula tion of the two Zilfis should be about 3,000 souls. 3. Ghat is terraced up the north side of a wadi. It has about 1,200 inhabitants and very large gardens. It lies one day S. of Zilfi and a short day N. of Mejma'. 4. Jalajil (or Janajil) lies 18 miles south of Mejma', and about 200 feet above it. It is a walled town with castle, some two-storeyed houses, and very large gardens, which has somewhat superseded Tuweim, 5 miles SE. (1,200 inhabitants). Shakespear estimated the population at about 4,000, but 2,000 seems the true figure. IX. Qasim Qasim is distinct from the other districts of Nejd in many respects, and has an individual history. It might better have been considered as a self-contained region were it not for its comparatively small area and its frequent political dependence on Nejd. It has Woshm SE. and the Ateibah steppe SW. : the same steppe and Jebel Shammar W. and N. ; the North Arabian Desert, where it changes from nefud to dahanah, NE. ; and the of Sedeir E. It measures about 90 miles S. to N., and about 60 miles E. to W. ; the axis lies from SSW. to NNE. (Rassto Sarif), a crow-fly distance of about 85 miles. Physically it consists of a section (about 100 miles) of the middle basin of the great Rummah depression. The north-eastern part of this is called High Qasim [Qasim el- Its wells are fed by under ground drainage from the higher-lying ground and mountain ranges of Jebel Shammar to NW. On its way to the Rummah depression this drainage follows at least one line of concentration marked by a chain of settlements from Quseibah through 'Ayun to near Boreidah. These lie along a well-marked valley, bounded E. by a sandy cliff. The southern half is in the main deep lying in long swelling waves, with uniform N. and S. direction. But it has aeabia i ao370 NEJD many sand-free patches in which cultivation is possible, and water obtainable at a few feet depth. The belt on the right hand of the Rummah depression is the most barren part, and has only a few scattered oases, of which one, however, supports one of the two largest towns, Aneizah. The northern end of this belt is steppe soon merging into nefud, which continues right up to Sedeir. No settlements lie in the Rummah depression itself, for fear of its sells or storm-floods ; but there is cultivation in it, especially on the gradual left-bank slope. Lower Qasim has been described as a land of ' green villages in a winding sheet of sand ', but great as is the proportion of nefud, the loamy bottoms of the oases are so deep and good that their vegetation has evoked the enthusiasm of Europeans who have come in sight of it after journeying over steppe and desert. Shakespear, looking down the Wadi Rummah on his way from Aneizah to Boreidah, found it ' a fine sight The settled population may be estimated at about 60,000. It is predominantly of the'ancient Tamim tribe, which Doughty calls a ' thick blood' disposing the Qusman to be prudent yet adven turous. The geographical situation of the district midway on a main trans-peninsular route (it is the only considerable oasis tract between Mecca and Mesopotamia), has had a strong economic influence (see p. 352 f.); and since the eastern half of the trans- peninsular route, down the Rummah (or Batin) depression, is free of difficult desert, whereas the western half has to cross some 200 miles of very lean and unsafe steppe, Qasim derives its social colour chiefly from Mesopotamia. While distinctly religious, inde pendent, and warlike, it has a wider outlook and more acquaintance with extra-Arabian civilization than any other inland district. The number of settlements of urban and village rank is over fifty, and among these are two towns more metropolitan than any others in Central Arabia. All the minor settlements (in Lower Qasim at any rate) depend to some extent on Boreidah and Aneizah, the former owning all except about half a dozen. Hence Boreidah is known as ' Umm el-Qasim ', i. e. ' Mother of Qasim '. This state of things appears to have obtained for two or three centuries at least ; but, to judge from the earlier Arab geographers, neither Boreidah nor Aneizah was of importance before the Middle Ages. 1. Boreidah lies at the N. end of Lower Qasim, high above the left bank of Wadi Rummah, which here makes a great elbow, embracing the town on three sides, but at some distance (six to seven miles). ' A great clay town built in the waste sand with enclosing walls and towers . . . beside a bluish dark wood of trees upon high dunes' (Doughty). It stands, in fact, on a sand-ridge, with a higher ridge* f DISTRICTS 371 to west of it; and between the latter and the walls are the great date gardens, invisible to one approaching from north-east or north. They extend for nearly 3 miles in the direction of Wadi Rummah to the village of Khadhar, and water, abundant but not very palatable, is obtainable in them at from 20 to 40 feet depth according to the flood level under the Rummah bed. Sand encroaches on these gardens. The walls form a quadrangle 15 feet high with towers at intervals, and four gates only, one in each face. Shakespear estimated the length of the N. face at ' nearly a mile '. Lorimer, quoting Leach- man, gives only 200 yards for the N. and S. faces and 400 for the E. and W. faces. This would be less than Raunkiaer's estimate of the enceinte of Zilfi in Sedeir, and Shakespear's photographs support his more generous impression. The town has five wards, (the largest), NE. ; Jedldah, SE. ; Butah, SW.; W. ; and Shamdl, NW. The suq, said to contain 300 shops, lies in the southern quarter and is approached directly from the S. gate. It is divided, in the regular Oriental urban manner, into trades. There are also camel and cattle markets, and six large mosques. The main fort, a vast erection with walls 40 feet high, the architecture of which Doughty greatly admired, is in the NE. In the NW. angle stands an old watch-tower, conspicuous in views of the town. Travellers' estimates of the urban population have varied from 8,000 to 15,000. Since, unlike Aneizah, the place does not include gardens within its walls, and every traveller has observed a busy life there, one must incline towards the larger total. The inhabi tants, who are mainly Beni Tamim, have made a uniformly bad impression on visitors as suspicious, inhospitable, and fanatical; and this character, so far as its repute has not been earned by the personal discourtesy of the Emirs (who happen to have been, from the peasant 'Abdullah in Doughty's time to Eahhad ibn Ma'mir, Ibn Sa'ud's representative to-day, objectionable individuals), is perhaps to be traced to the frontier position which has made the town a bone of contention between the Emirs of Riyadh and Ha'il for more than half a century, while itself desiring only to be free of both. In other respects its society seems comparatively civilized. Doughty thought the place as urban as any Mesopotamian city, but for the absence of public coffee-shops, and praised the variety and cheapness of its supplies. The inhabitants travel widely, a large proportion being cameleers ; not only can many citizens be found who have been in India, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Syria, but an occasional individual who has seen America. The place, besides doing a great carrying trade between Meso potamia and Mecca, exports ghi, dates, and cereals. Its breed a a 2372 NEJD of stock has declined during the long wars between Ha'il and Riyadh, and little trade is done in horseflesh now. The town is healthy owing to its comparatively elevated position on clean sand, and fortunate in having fertile and easily irrigated garden-grounds close at hand. It possesses about 1,000 camels and considerable other stock. 2. Aneizah {'Oneizah) stands on the right of Wadi Eummah, some 2 miles from the bank and about 12 miles SSE. of Boreidah. It occupies a loamy hollow with nefud running round it on the north. Indeed, almost all ground immediately outside the town is desert, and all palm-gardens (except two or three) are included within the outer walls, now ruinous. An inner wall in better repair encloses the residential quarter. The gardens are singularly dense and luxuriant, and from one to two miles in breadth on the north side. This singular arrangement of walled town within walled oasis has rendered Aneizah at all times very self-sufficing and defensible; and its population, having preserved more independence than that of Boreidah, is less affected by fear and suspicion. The water, though abundant and not deep down, is not very good, there being but one quite sweet well. The inner wall is less thick than the outer, but, like it, is strength ened by towers. The city proper has three wards : (1) north and west; (2) Hof uf, south ; and (3) Umm Himdr, east It boasts no such palace as Boreidah, and its Emir, elected locally, lives in the market. There is a or fort, above the east gate, immediately outside which lies a large open space used by caravans. The houses, while like those of Boreidah all adobe, are cleaner and better built. There are at least 15 mosques. The population is reported at the present moment to be less than that of Boreidah, and probably does not much exceed 10,000. The towns men make a more pleasant impression than the Boreidah folk, though mainly of the same creed. They gain by a large infusion of Beni Khalid blood in the Tamlm stock. Tobacco is freely smoked, and attendance at prayer not rigorously insisted upon. The spirit of the people, however, is not less independent and warlike. The town is as well and variously supplied as Boreidah, exceeds it in live stock, and equals it in the number and excellence of domestic crafts, its metal-workers being renowned. But, though it does a similar carrying and export trade, and has as wide relations, it is distinctly a less cosmopolitan and commercial place. The trans- peninsular route, via Bass, does not necessarily touch Aneizah. At the same time it offers as good an example of a purely Arab urban centre as can be found.fit I'o DISTRICTS 373 Aneizah has always contested with Boreidah the primacy of Qasim, and at the present time is the less subjugated of the two. It retains an emir of its own choice, who is limited by a local constitutional tradition. In armed contests, if neither Riyadh nor Ha'il has inter fered, Aneizah has generally got the better of Boreidah. It claims the metropolitan title ' Umm en-Nejd '. 3. Rass is at the southern and higher end of Lower Qasim, about 50 miles SSW. of Boreidah and 40 SW. of Aneizah, on the right bank of Wadi Rummah. It is a walled town with three wards, Ruweidhah, Rafl'ah, and Shindnah, and a high watch-tower. It contains some 3,500 inhabitants, and gave much trouble to Ibrahim Pasha in 1817, standing a long siege. It has been visited by no European since two years after that date, when Sadlier passed through it on his way from Aneizah to Medina. He has, unfortu nately, left no description of the place. Its gardens lie on all sides except the east, and it has large fields in the Rummah bed and elsewhere. 4. Khabrah is on the left bank of Wadi Rummah, about 9 miles N. of Rass. It is a walled town of about 3,000 inhabitants, with a Friday market, a high watch-tower, and a large public square in the centre. Water is drawn from wells at 50 feet depth. It is a poor place, meanly built, but possesses some 300 camels. 5. 'Ayun, in Upper Qasim, about 28 miles NW. of Boreidah, is an unwalled, though frontier, town. It lies in a depression and extends for about half a mile from south to north. Doughty, who passed near it in 1878, thought it a small place of not more than 500 souls; but it has grown by the junction of two villages, and is said now to hold at least 4,000 inhabitants, and to be more important than Rass. It has, however, no regular suq. It grows a variety of date of local renown in its large gardens, irrigated from sweet and abundant wells about 30 feet deep. Leachman, who was well received here in 1912, found several travelled men in the place and heard that many inhabitants were cameleers. The air is heavy, and the town not very healthy. 6. Quseibah, in the extreme NE. of Upper Qasim, is sometimes reckoned to Jebel Shammar, and is often in the power of the Emir of Ha'il. It lies in a deep hollow of the steppe, and has abundant but saltish water at little depth, one spring being warm. The gardens are very large {2%miles long), and the dates grown are very fine. The inhabitants (2,500) live in four detached wards, or separate walled villages, on the W. side of the hollow. The place is mosquito-ridden and feverish.CHAPTER XI JEBEL SHAMMAR Abba The Arabian highland, stretching southward from the sands of the Northern Nefud towards the Wadi er-Rummah, is known as Jebel Shammar. The term, which was originally geographical, being applied to the highlands where the tribe of that name wan dered and engaged in cultivation, has now become of greater political significance. There is, therefore, a certain vagueness about its boundaries. Topographically, Jebel Shammar signifies the mountain groups of Jebel Aja and Jebel Selmah, together with the outlying groups of Trnan, Misma, Hubran, and Rumman, &amp;c., all occupied by the Shammar tribesmen. But since the establishment of the Emirate at Ha'il, the name has been extended to the whole area under the jurisdiction of its ruler. Even these frontiers, like all tribal borders, are not clearly defined, for they shift with the varying fortunes of the rival Emirs of Ha'il and Riyadh. Broadly speaking, the administrative district of Jebel Shammar is bounded westwards by the Hejaz, southwards by the Qasim province of Nejd, while the Nefud and the Dahanah form a sort of neutral zone, on the N. and E., between the Emirate and the independent nomad tribes who hold the steppes beyond. In greater detail: the Shammar kingdom extends so as to embrace the oasis of Teima, and, until recently, Jauf ; Hayyaniyah and Trobah (Trubah) stand as the Emir's outposts on the NE., while southwards the line of demarcation between Jebel Shammar and High Qasim passes—somewhat uncertainly—between Kehafah and Quseibah, thence to the Wadi Rummah, following up to its sources in the Kheibar Harrah. This watershed between Persian Gulf and Red Sea drainage can be taken as the boundary between Jebel Shammar and the Hejaz. The whole area has a total breadth of 300 miles, while from the Nefud to the Rummah is 150 miles. Physical Character The Shammar Emirate is a plateau, lifted to 2,300 ft. above sea- level, and seamed by higher uplifts. The plateau is tilted, fallingPHYSICAL CHARACTER 375 from the SW. to the NE., the watershed in the Kheibar Harrah being about 5,000 ft. above sea-level, and the north-eastern fron tiers being only 2,000 ft. The drainage, for the most part, falls into the Wadi Rummah. The principal features of the Emirate—and indeed of all Northern Arabia—are the two parallel ranges of mountains Jebel Aja and Jebel Selmah. These lie in the northern part of the Emirate, and run in the same direction as the tilt of the plateau, viz. from SW. to NE. They are granite ridges of con siderable height. Jebel Aja averages 1,000 ft. above the plain, and rises at one point—Jebel Eara'—to 5,550 ft. above sea-level. The range covers an area of about 100 miles by 20 miles. Jebel Selmah is not very much lower in altitude, but it is considerably less in area. The mountain region is continued westwards along the southern borders of the Nefud, by isolated groups of sandstone crags such as Trnan, Kharam, Misma, and Hubran ; southwards also there are small uplifts of granite and basalt, such as Rumman and Habshi. Geologically, the region can be divided into two zones : the western and north-western plain, dotted with solitary sandstone crags, shelving finally into the Nefud sand-bed ; and the southern and eastern basalt plains out of which rise the granite ridges, capped with basalt. The lava beds of Kheibar lie on the south-western edge of the region. Jebel Aja is the principal feature of the Shammar Emirate. It rises abruptly out of the plain, and is dominated by imposing crags which are worn into fantastic shapes by the sand-bearing winds from the NW. The barrenness of its flanks is intensified by a con siderable amount of vegetation in its gullies; brushwood, acacias, and palms show that these hills attract a certain quantity of mois ture. There is a considerable amount of animal life ; ibex Sinaitica), gazelle, fox, wolf, jackal, hyrax (coney), and partridges of three varieties are all to be found in the ' Jebel The ruggedness of the mountains constitutes a certain barrier between Ha'il and the outside world. Laden camels cannot easily cross to the NW. or to the S., and some tracks are difficult for any but unshod horses. A notable col gives access to Ha'il from the direction of Teima, named Ri' es-Self, a defile which cuts the range a little to the SW. of Ha'il. A similar pass cuts Jebel Selmah at about its centre. Within these two ranges is comprised the heart of the Shammar Emirate, As might be expected, the natural conditions of this region are more favourable to progress than are the featureless deserts below. The air is exhilarating and the climate healthy. The highlands attract sufficient rainfall to ensure a certain supply of grazing,376 JEBEL SHAMMAR while the water below the surface is so near and so easily tapped that there is an unusually large cluster of oases. The fact that about one-half of the subjects of the Emir are cultivators not herdsmen, shows that the conditions are very different to those of most of desert Arabia. Nomadism is not the principal mode of life ; indeed, if it were not for the rich vegetation of the Nefud the herdsmen of the Shammar would be ill supplied with pasturage' The cultivated areas are situated for the most part in the 'BatiV between Jebel Aja and Jebel Selmah ; but there are a few scattered villages on the northern flanks of Aja, while there is another group of settlements to the SW. of the twin ranges, where many sources rise which flow towards the Rummah. There are no permanent streams, but springs abound and an abundant supply of underground water is fairly easily tapped by wells which are seldom less than 100 ft. in depth. Water is most abundant in the ' Batin' between the ranges and on their flanks, especially towards the SW. Beyond this the typical arid steppes prevail, which are badly supplied with wells. A string of watering- places extends along the southern margin of the Nefud, but none are very abundant, the only permanent water between Jebel Shammar and Teima sufficient for a large assemblage being the Beidha Nethil. The rainfall is scanty but regular. The first rains are due in November, and when they are sufficient, the winter prosperity of the desert is assured. A few thunderstorms in February or March will keep the camel-thorn green until early summer. All cultivation, of course, is dependent upon irrigation. After heavy rains, water runs in torrents down the bare rocky hills, but no attempt is made to store it. The high plateau is cold in winter ; snow falls occasionally on Jebel Aja, and has been known to lie for several hours on the high plains. Even during the summer the nights are cool. The climate is, therefore, not unhealthy; epidemic diseases are rare and are always brought from without. P opulation In contrast to Nejd proper, which is almost entirely occupied by settled communities, Jebel Shammar contains a strange mixture of sedentary husbandmen and wandering Bedouins. Owing to its altitude and more equable climate, the region enjoys more favourable conditions, and consequently supports a population of a higher stamp than that produced by the lowlying deserts. The Shammar are a powerful tribe, and with their confederates form a strong alliance.ipfc POPULATION 377 The mixture of nomadic and sedentary conditions is remarkable. Bedouins do things that no other desert tribe would do, while at certain seasons the villagers themselves lead a partially nomadic existence. Bedouins possess palm-groves, and the cultivators own and pasture innumerable horses, camels, and sheep. Numbers are necessarily unreliable, but it is estimated that the sedentary population of the territory under the present Emir (excluding Jauf) probably does not exceed 18,000, while the nomads are under 20,000. The townfolk are concentrated chiefly around the heart of the Emirate in the neighbourhood of the ' Jebel'. Beyond this area range the pastoral sections of the Shammar tribe, their limits being bounded by the Harb, the Huteim, the Bishr section of the Anazah, and the Fuqara section of the Wuld 'Ali on the SW. and W., by the Sherarat on the NW., while the Anazah clan holds and threatens the whole of the northern and north eastern frontiers. The people of Ha'il and of the villages (except a few merchants from Nejef) are fanatical Mohammedans, belonging to the strict sect of the Wahabites. The tribes are at once more indifferent and more liberal; yet, for the most part, the hours of prayer are observed among them, and the influence of Wahabism is felt up to the Sham- mar frontiers and even beyond. European travellers, however, have been received more cordially in the Shammar oasis than in Nejd ; and it should not be difficult for British soldiers to gain the goodwill of so essentially a Bedouin society as that of Jebel Shammar. P roducts and T rade Jebel Shammar does not produce (enough of the necessities of life to support its population, in spite of the fact that the inhabitants are entirely employed in agricultural or pastoral pursuits. There must be a very considerable head of stock, if we include horses, camels, sheep, and goats. The horses are of value for export to India. The camels are of a very good type, and are also sold in considerable numbers in Mesopotamia. The sheep yield a fine wool, and with innumerable goats form the staple meat-supply of the country. The date-palm, apricot, apple, pomegranate, lemon, and quince are cultivated in the oases, but of these only the date- palm can be considered to furnish a food-supply of any appreciable value. Wheat, barley, oats, millet, and maize are grown ; also lucerne for fodder. There are no exports except the camels and horses, and no manufacture with the exception of a common cloth woven by the women, and a few striped abbas and coarse carpets.378 JEBEL SHAMMAR these being all for home use. All trade is carried on with the towns of Turkish 'Iraq, not with the Hejaz or the Syrian vilayets; there is a considerable caravan traffic between Jebel Shammar and Basra and Koweit. Recent Histoby and Present Politics The Rashid have been the dominating house among the Shammar since the end of the eighteenth century, when they overturned the Beni 'Ali, who are also of the Ja'far sub-tribe. Beginning as wakUs of the Beni Sa'ud in Ha'il, they gradually threw off the yoke of Riyadh and asserted their independence. The reigning Emir, Sa'ud ibn Rashid, is a boy under 20, ignorant and weak. He came to the throne in 1908, two years after the death of his father, 'Abd el-'Aziz, in battle against Ibn Sa'ud and the Muteir tribesmen. During the interval three Emirs had fallen victims to the ambitions of their nearest relatives, and three times Ha'il had witnessed massacres of some branch of the Rashid family. In this stormy period, after the death of 'Abd el-'Aziz, the suc cessive Emirs Mit'ab, the elder half-brother of Sa'ud, and two distant cousins. Sultan and Sa'ud ibn Hamud, enjoyed a brief authority, brought in each case to an abrupt termination by the hand of the successor. Each accession was attended by a compre hensive massacre of all the nearest male relatives of the late Emir, together with all their male slaves. Even the people of Ha'il, accus tomed as they are to accept the feuds of their sheikhly house as akin to other natural phenomena uncontrollable by man, speak with scarcely veiled horror of the family history of their rulers during the two years which elapsed between the death of 'Abd el-'Aziz and the establishment of Sa'ud on the throne. The preservation of the infant Sa'ud was due partly to the fact that his mother had been taken to wife by the usurper Sultan, and partly to the care of his maternal uncle, Hamud ibn Subhan, son and successor of the vizier of the Emir Mohammed. The child was sent to Mecca and remained there in safe hands till 1908, when Hamud compassed the murder of the reigning Emir, Sa'ud ibn Hamud, and recalled from Mecca the young Sa'ud ibn 'Abd el-'Aziz. He cannot, at the date of his accession, have been more than 10 years old. Hamud, by all accounts an able and statesmanlike man, died in the following year, and was succeeded as tutor and adviser to the Emir by another member of the Subhan house, Zamil, a wise and moderate man, who directed the government of Jebel Shammar in the Emir's name. He was assassinated in 1914, the victim oiRECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 379 another court intrigue, and with him wisdom and sobriety of judge- ^ 1 ment are said to have vanished from the immediate counsels of the Hid Emir. His post as the Emir's adviser was taken by the distant cousin who had instigated the murder, Sa'ud ibn Salih es-Subhan, a man of bad reputation and little ability. Sa'ud himself has a reputation for irresponsible violence. Notwithstanding these internal dissensions, the policy of the mar Rashid house has held to the lines laid down a generation ago by the the great Emir Mohammed, though the authority of the ruler of lift Jebel Shammar has suffered considerable diminution. Mohammed eof instituted friendly relations with the Turks, which have been con- i 'M tinued unbroken. Erom 1888 until his death in 1897 he maintained the a supremacy over Riyadh, which was lost by his nephew and suc- Iziz, cessor, 'Abd el-'Aziz. In fact, since 1897 the Rashid have been the almost continuously at war with Ibn Sa'ud, Emir of Riyadh, and heir fortune has been mainly on the latter's side. On several occasions, isof notably in 1904 and 1905, Ottoman forces were called in to help 'Abd el-'Aziz in his struggle against Ibn Sa'ud and the Sheikh of stic- Koweit; but in an eight years' campaign, which impoverished his two own territories, he did not succeed in unseating his rival. The inter- jrief vening oases of Qasim have thrown off their allegiance to Ha'il. Of the their chief towns, Aneizah is now ruled, under Ibn Sa'ud's suzerainty, pre- by an independent Sheikh, and Boreidah pays tribute to Riyadh. It mir, is true that for the last two years, since Ibn Sa'ud has been engaged in ens- the Hasa, Ibn Rashid has been able to maintain his position against to him ; the latest pitched battle between the Emirs, fought at Mejma' nth early in 1915, left honours easy. There have been rumours that the ting Sherif of Mecca, with whom Ibn Rashid is on friendly terms, has In attempted, through the mediation of his second son, 'Abdullah (see jon p. 355), to bring about a reconciliation between the two ; but his y efforts do not seem to have been attended with any success ; nor, !a ie in any case, is a lasting peace within the bounds of probability. Ibn Rashid still holds the oasis of Teima and exacts a yearly in( l tribute from the group of Bishr tribes,' Awajah, Wuld Suleiman, and ged Euqara (Eejr), who roam over the southern and western borders y of the Nefud and over the desert up to the Hejaz Railway; but to the north the Sherarat have slipped from his hands into those of the Huweitat, and to the south the Harb no longer give him obedience, [in The Huteim offer open resistance, raiding the Teima road up to the the gates of Ha'il. The oasis of Jauf el-'Amr, on the northern edge 1]lt | of the Nefud, an important station on the caravan road from Ha'il nar to Damascus, was seized four years ago by the Ruweilah Sheikh, [0 f Nuri esh-Sha'lan, and is administered by his sonNawwaf ; nor has380 JEBEL SHAMMAR the Emir, in spite of a determined attack in 1914, succeeded in regaining it. Caravan traffic from Damascus has fallen off with the growing lawlessness of the desert, and the market for the sheep and camels of Jebel Shammar has shrunk in consequence. The weakened con trol exercised by the Emir over the desert has borne other fruits prejudicial to the prosperity of Ha'il. The road from Nejef to Jebel Shammar has grown too unsafe to admit of the passage of the Shiah Hajj under Ibn Rashid's escort. Since, in 1912, the Ottoman Government forbade pilgrims to use this road to the Holy Cities the Baghdad Hajj has not been re-established, and a fertile source of revenue to the Shammar has disappeared with it. But the means of communication between Ha'il and Damascus have improved with the opening of the Hejaz Railway ; the journey can now be performed in six days, four days' camel-riding to Mu'adhdham, and two by rail. Thus the whole journey from Constantinople to Ha'il now takes under a fortnight if sufficient camel-transport is forth coming. It is by this route that presents of money, motor-cars, rifles, ammunition, and even of a few machine-guns, have come down from the Sultan of Turkey to his friend and ally in Central Arabia. To estimate the forces which the Emir can put into the field is a difficult matter. Doughty reckoned the settled population of Jebel Shammar at 20,000, and the allied tribes at about 14,000 souls. Of these last, about 6,000 (using his figures as a basis) have now passed out of the control of Ha'il. He thought Ibn Rashid could arm about 2,000 villagers and some 1,500 tribesmen. Guarmani had put the figure higher ; he spoke of a possible 3,000 armed and mounted men from Jebel Shammar, and some 8,000 from the allied tribes. His figures are certainly inflated ; while Doughty's perhaps are rather low, more especially since the arming of levies must now be largely facilitated by the Sultan's bounty. In his annual raids Sa'ud takes with him a force of about 800 fighting men, composed of tribesmen and his own personal bodyguard of slaves brought up in his household. Besides new machine-guns, reported to be served by Ottoman gunners, there are at Ha'il ten or twelve ancient pieces of artillery dating from the time of the Emir Moham med or even earlier ; but these weapons might conceivably cause more casualties among those who used them than in the ranks of the foe against whom they were turned. Outside his personal guard and his villagers, who are unswervingly loyal to him, the tribal forces are a fluctuating quantity, except those derived from his own Shammar, who number perhaps a thousand armed and mounted men, or somewhat less. These provide a solid nucleus bound to-, RECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT POLITICS 381 ^ ® gether by close tribal relations and by what might be called a national pride in Shammar achievements during the past 50 years. The result is a measure of unity rare in Arabia. Combined with mels valour and a plentiful supply of arms, it will continue to make Jebel ^ Shammar formidable to its neighbours. Over this group the Rashid raits are revered autocrats. They themselves are tribesmen, being of the Mel 'Abdah, one of the great Shammar divisions, and their hold on their ' ^ own people is undisputed. They share the tribal life. After the Man first winter rains have quickened vegetation in the warm sandy fa, hollows of the Nefud, they go out under tents with their horses and race herds of camels ; and yearly, when their cattle have recovered from leans the semi-starvation of winter, they lead—following a universal wed nomad custom—a raid against some tribe which has troubled their w k borders or grown so rich in flocks and herds as to concentrate upon ,M{1 itself the cupidity of its rivals. Hal Since the days of the Emir Mohammed there has been a diplo- ortl- matic connexion between Ha'il, Damascus, and Constantinople. «, 'Abd el-Hamid cultivated Ibn Rashid's friendship in the hope of lown establishing a point d'appui from which Ottoman influence, radiating at over Arabia, might counteract the machinations of England, which ildis he held to be based on Koweit and to extend to Riyadh. In 1904-5 in of small expeditions were sent from Basra to aid the Emir Abd el- onls. 'Aziz, who was hard pressed by Ibn Sa'ud, and this policy has been no* continued under the present Sultan. In December 1915 the Otto- iGiild man Government was said to be reaping the fruits of its forethought rnani and obtaining through Ibn Rashid camels for the expedition against and Egypt; but personal relations between Wahabite Arabs and adherents ied of the C.U.P., who are regarded by the former as little better than haps infidels, are never likely to be easy, and as yet no permanent Turkish no* representative has been posted at Ha'il. raids The policy of the Emir Sa'ud ibn Rashid has been anti-British, losed in that he has worked with the Turks and been hostile to the Sultan fflj of Koweit; and lately he has shown some active hostility towards 0 te us, and towards sheikhs and tribes friendly with us in the Euphrates t - e lye valley. But independence is, after all, the primary desire of the jjjj . Shammar federation; although until lately the comparative ease allS f with which the Turks could reach Ha'il from either the Hejaz Rail- jgof way or Samawah, has contributed to make Jebel Shammar sensitive mjd to Ottoman pressure. ■y If assured against both Turkish attack and Ibn Sa'ud, the Rashid pU Emir would not be hostile to us. The princes of his house have the M tastes and interests of nomads. They covet the Jauf oasis as a 11 0 . - point of control north of the desert, and are largely dependent on the384 JEBEL SHAMMAR Shatt el-'Arab district for supplies. The produce of the oases of Jebel Shammar is not sufficient to support the traditional hospi tality of the Emir's palace. Every spring he brings down food- caravans from Nejef and Samawah. Like the nomads in all other parts of Arabia the Shammar must go beyond their own borders for much of their supplies, food, clothing, and for the utensils which even the most primitive desert existence demands. Since the Damascus trade has diminished they have become the more depen dent on Mesopotamia and the Gulf. Indian brocades are worn by the Emir's harem, and every house in Ha'il is lighted by oil lamps from Baghdad. Any interruption of this traffic would seriously embarass the inhabitants of the Jebel. In short, here, as elsewhere in Arabia, it must be borne in mind that those who hold the settled lands and their markets can control the interior. D istricts and S ettlements As has been already noted, the principal settled district lies in the hollow between Jebel Aja and Jebel Selmah. Here is situated the capital, Ha'il, and not far off to the SW. is Qafar (Gofar)— another very ancient village—on the southern flanks of Jebel Aja. Nearer Jebel Selmah is another group of villages, including Peid, the ancient capital. On the north of Jebel Aja, between it and the Nefud, are a few scattered oases, but none are of any particular importance. In the mountains there are many cultivated areas which are only occupied during the season of agriculture. There is only one settled area of any size in Jebel Aja, namely 'Aqdah. Here, in a well-protected valley, are several scattered villages and palm-groves which are reputed to number 75,000 trees. The only other district where settled localities exist is on the south-western spurs of Jebel Selmah, of which Mustajiddah is the centre. Beyond this the outlying portions of Jebel Shammar are portioned out between the various nomad graziers ; villages do not exist except for the outposts such as Teima, Jubbah, the Beqa' depression, and Kehafah, &amp;c. There are, however, several centres, where, owing to a good supply of well-water and of fodder. Bedouins are wont to con gregate. The Beidha Nethil, on the western confines, is such a place; Jubbah, in the Nefud, is another; HayyanIyah,Trobah, Sha'ibah, are all held by the Emir's guards for the protection of his nomad subjects. The only town in the Emirate is Ha'il, the capital, of which the following is a description :— Ha'il lies in the Batin, on the NW. side of the valley between Mts. Aja and Selmah, at its N. end. It is sheltered behind the rocky volcanic ridges of J. Samra, which spread N. and NE. in twoDISTRICTS AND SETTLEMENTS 385 wings, separated by a dry torrent bed. To the W. the northern Samra runs down into low mounds, flanking the town. The main part of Ha'il is surrounded by a battlemented mud wall, 15 to 20 ft. high, set at intervals with round machicolated towers. It was built by the Emir 'Abd el-'Aziz, andis from 3 to 4 miles in circumference, but within its enclosure much of the ground is taken up by cornfields and vineyards, while some is neither built over nor cultivated. Five gates break the line of the outer wall, the Medina Gate on the SE., the small Mubbah Gate (called after the quarter to which it gives access) to the E., the Nejef Gate to the N., the Jubbah Gate to the W., and another small gate to the SW. All are closed after sunset. To the north, the part of the town which runs up between the Samra hills is not walled ; it consists only of palm gardens with a few scattered houses, and the mean dwellings of semi-nomadic folk. About half a mile E. of Ha'il, and 2 or 3 miles to the S. under Jebel Aja, are a few walled palm gardens and cornfields held by the Rashid. Besides the palm, the pomegranate, sweet lemon, (citron), an inferior orange, quince, apricot, and apple are cultivated. The water, both for irrigation and for household purposes, is drawn by water-wheels worked with camels from wells some 90 ft. deep. At the northern end of the town, among the palm-groves, the wells are shallower, but the water is slightly brackish. There is no other water-supply in Ha'il but the wells. Within the town some of the larger houses are provided with tall mud-built towers, like wingless windmills, the largest of all, the Barzan, forming part of the palace of the Emirs. The palace and the adjoining market are separated by an inner wall from the rest of the town. A heavy wooden gate way, guarded by slaves and closed at night, gives access to these precincts. The southern quarter of the town, the Samah, consists of wide, empty, walled enclosures, some of which are cultivated, while in some the wells have become partially choked, and the ground produces nothing but a few tamarisks Adjoining the Medina Gate is the summer palace of Mohammed er-Rashid, now little used save for the entertainment of guests. The population of Ha'il is probably about 4,000. It includes a large number of slaves, some of mixed parentage born in Arabia, others full-blooded negroes imported from Africa the Hejaz. The supply of these last has largely diminished, and, in the last few years, has almost ceased. Nevertheless, a household of any preten sions has its slaves ; the Emir's bodyguard and the labourers he employs in his gardens are all bondsmen. A few merchants from Nejef are probably the only free persons in the town who are not natives of J. Shammar. The inhabitants are fanatical Wahabite ARABIA I ^386 JEBEL SHAMMAE Moslems, abjurers of tobacco and strict observers of the fast and the hours of prayer. The women are veiled and closely secluded. The palace is a mud-built fortress with walls over 30 ft. high, sur mounted by the great Barzan tower. Besides the Emir's reception halls and living rooms, it contains his public cofEee hall, and a cloistered court, the rudif, surrounded by two stories of rooms devoted to the use of guests. Doughty reckoned the cost of the Emir's hospitality at £1,500 a year. Opposite the palace is the Great Mosque. There are few trades in Ha'il except those of the herdsman and the agriculturist, but the people live well according to desert standards, and are comfortably removed from want. Mutton is good and cheap (the sheep of Jebel Shammar are famous); from mid-winter till the late summer, milk, butter, and sour curds are to be had in abundance ; rice and most grain stuffs are brought wholly or in part from the Mesopotamian markets, but as a staple of diet they are largely replaced by a plentiful supply of dates. The principal villages may be divided into two groups, those in the Batin and on the flanks of Jebel Aja and Jebel Selmah, and those which, with Mustajiddah as a centre, lie farther towards the SW. on the track to Medina. 1. Feid, 45 miles ESE. of Ha'il, on the Boreidah route, lying on the south-eastern flanks of Jebel Selmah. The palm-groves extend for two or three miles, and there is considerable cultivation of cereals. The inhabitants, who are partly Shammar and partly Beni Tamim, number about 1,000. 2. Qatar (Gofar), the second town of importance in Jebel Shammar, and almost equal to Ha'il in the number of its population. It is situated in the Batin to the SW. of the capital, under the slopes of Jebel Aja. The oasis is extensive, and the palm-groves are even more numerous than those of Ha'il. It is inhabited by Beni Tamim. Qafar lies on the track to Teima at the mouth of the defile, Ei' es- Self, which cuts Jebel Aja by a fairly easy pass. 3. 'Aqdah. A group of scattered villages situated in a large group of palm-groves, which fill an enclosed valley in Jebel Shammar to the SW. of Ha'il. The situation is peculiar, for it is entirely shut in by steep granite crags, except for one narrow gorge. Owing to its inaccessible nature, it has been regarded by the Rashid family as their ancestral stronghold ; the entrance is fortified so as to make it a still safer refuge. This amphitheatre is large enough to contain palms to the number of 75,000 and several villages, which have a total population of about 1,500. 4. Muqaq lies on the side of Jebel Aja, on the slopes facingDISTRICTS AND SETTLEMENTS 387 SW. It guards the entrance to the Ri' es-Self defile. There are about 100 houses, and a little cultivation. 5. Sab'an, situated on the Batin side of Jebel Selmah, is a small village of 50 houses and some cultivation. The group of villages, which have Mustajiddah as their centre, lies towards the Wadi Rummah on the Medina track ; the more important are the following : 6. Mustajiddah itself is about 67 miles from Ha'il. It has 100 houses of the Beni Tamim, Shammar, and Huteim, and a consider able area under cultivation of dates and cereals. 7. Ghazalah, 10 miles W. of Mustajiddah, has 60 houses of Sham- mar, Anazah, and Huteim. There are date-groves and other culti vation. 8. Hafnah, to the NE. of Mustajiddah, consists of 50 houses of Shammar, with palms and corn land. 9. Raudhah, 15 miles to the NE. of Mustajiddah, has 50 houses of mixed Arab tribes, with cultivation. 10. Sanurah, to the E. of Mustajiddah, overlooking the Wadi er- Rummah, has 50 houses of Beni Tamim, with good corn land, but no palms. Other outlying villages, under the rule of the Rashid, are on the western marches (for description see pp. 1181), and (see vol. ii, p. 113) midway between Ha'il and Boreidah, the last oasis before entering Qasim. The latter village is unwalled, and contains about 50 houses ; there are about 3,000 palms and some cultivation. It will be convenient to include in this chapter a description of Jauf el-'Amr, as, until its recent capture by the Ruweilah, it was under the rule of the Rashid : Jauf el-'Amr) is the principal town of a large cultivated area, which is situated on the northern edge of the Nefud, at the head of the Wadi Sirhan, being bounded on the north by the Syrian Hamad. The main oasis lies in a large saline depression, the floor of which is about 500 ft. below the surrounding deserts. There are several outlying oases, dependencies of Jauf, situated to the north-east of the depression ; these are Sakakah, Qa'rah (large oases), Tuweir (or Atweir) and Jawah (small hamlets) r Of these Sakakah is the most impor tant, its palm-groves being even more extensive than those of Jauf itself. The oasis of Jauf el-'Amr is a long narrow belt of gardens and palm-groves, covering an area measuring some 2 to 3 miles in length, with an average breadth of -J a mile. It runs from NW. to SE. Interspersed among the gardens and palm- groves are the various villages or S (eight to twelve in number, according to various authorities) which together compose a strag-388 JEBEL SHAMMAR gling town of about 400 houses. The settlement has no bazaar nor streets, the central nucleus of houses being crossed by a number of very tortuous lanes between high mud walls. A characteristic feature of the larger houses, both here and throughout the Jauf, is a round tower, usually of unbaked brick, from 30 ft. to 40 ft. in height and 12 ft. or more in breadth, with a narrow entrance and loopholes above. In some houses the tower forms part of the house ; in others it is built in the garden. The dwellings of the chief families are generally isolated, being surrounded by their own gardens and plantations. The houses of the poorer classes are clustered together in irregular groups. The gardens, which fill the intervals between the quarters, are usually enclosed by mud walls 10 ft. in height; they are exceedingly productive and are famous for the dates which they produce. Although these form the staple food-supply, wheat, barley, millet, maize, lucerne, vegetables, and fruits of various kinds are cultivated. The latter include apricots, figs, peaches, grapes, and melons. The chief industry is the weaving of 'abbas', saddle-bags, and camel- gear. The ' abbas ' are of excellent quality and are in great demand over all northern Arabia and Syria. The inhabitants have also a great reputation as artificers in metal and marble. The water- supply is abundant, and comparatively near the surface, but the water is insipid. The most striking feature of the town is the castle, which stands on rising ground above the principal at the south-eastern end of the oasis, and is of comparatively recent construction. It is a large irregular mass of rough masonry of early date, originally rectangular, but so patched and added to that its original form has almost disappeared ; the lower tiers are constructed of dressed stones. Near the centre of the castle stands a tower about 50 ft. in height and 20 ft. broad at the base, provided with narrow loop holes for defence. It is partially enclosed by a curtain wall built of rough blocks with rubble. The entrance gate, which is arched, lies at the southern angle. On the same side of the oasis (the southern), but further to the NW. 5 rises the castle of ' Marid' or the 'Rebel'. It is of massive stone masonry, probably of Arab construction. Jauf derives considerable importance from its geographical position, for it lies on the direct caravan route between Central Arabia and Syria. It is quite isolated, being about midway between the Euphrates and the Hejaz Railway, and between Jebel Shammar and Jebel Duruz. It lies roughly some two to three hundred miles from any of these points and is the only oasis of any note between Akaba and Baghdad.CHAPTER XII THE NORTHERN NEFUD AND DAHANAH BELTS A. The Northern Nefud The Northern Nefud is a wilderness of deep sand, which separates the Syrian desert from Jebel Shammar. It extends about 140 miles from N. to S., and about 180 miles from E. to W. Formerly it was considered to be of much greater dimensions ; but the limits of the sand area are now accurately known, and the above is a fair allowance for the maximum distribution of the Nefud. It forms a rough triangle, extending from a day's march E. of Teima to the edge of the Jauf depression ; southwards it reaches to the foot of Jebel Aja, and in the NE. to the wells of Hayyaniyah. The unbroken sand-bed is known as Nefud (or Nefd, plur. Anfad), or occasionally by the Bedouins as rami 'dli, ' the high sandThe term Nefud was applied by Doughty to all sand-tracks in the peninsula. The Arabs say,' the Nefud reaches from Jauf to San'a.' As a general statement this is correct; but, to be more exact, there are two main sand- beds—the Nefud in the N. and the Ruba' el-Khali in the S., these being more or less connected by the tongues and belts of sand which chiefly cross the eastern confines of Nejd, but also lie in isolated patches across the very heart of the peninsula. These are called Little Nefuds or Dahanah, according to their character, the latter term being especially applied to the belts which are composed of parallel ridges of sand, divided by intervening plains of hard steppe (see above, p. 11). On the N. and W. the margin of the sand-bed of the Northern Nefud is very abrupt, the dunes rising like a wall above the sur rounding steppes. On the S. the margin is less clearly defined. On the E. the sands break away from their uniform boundary and throw out long tongue-like strips into the hard desert. The two most remarkable of these are the Dahanah and the Ardh el-Madhu', one of which continues right across the centre of the peninsula, eventually joining up with the southern desert, while the other extends for a hundred miles. In the true Nefud there are practically no wells, but its margins390 NORTHERN NEFUD AND DAHANAH BELTS are fairly well supplied with water. The only break in the whole extent of sand is the depression of Jubbah, on the Jauf-Ha'il track. This locality is a hollow, about 300 feet below the level of the surrounding sands, protected from encroachment by a ridge of low sandstone hills. In earlier days there was a settlement here— Wallin reckoned it at 170 families, besides palm-groves and abun dant water-supply. Later on it was reduced to about a hundred inhabitants, and according to the most recent report it is now abandoned altogether. The neighbourhood is, however, still a great centre for nomads, for the grazing is some of the best in the Nefud. The only other settled locality in the sand-bed is the small village of Qana, which lies just inside the Nefud on the track between Ha'il and Jubbah. It used to contain about 20 houses, with a small patch of cultivated ground. There are a few watering-places just within the margin of the Nefud; for instance, Shaqiq, 12-14 hours to the SE. of Jauf, can be said to be inside the sand-belt; Nolde records the wells of ' HoaESE. of Jauf in the Nefud, and Wallin watered at Bir 'Atwa, in the sands between Ha'il and Hayyaniyah. On the southern margin there is water in the great ' Eelj ' of Umm el-Qulban to the NNW. of Ha'il, and at Hazun (or Heizun), Qulban (or Gulban), and 'Abeisah, between Ha'il and Teima. These are the only known wells actually in the sands ; but it is possible that there are others known only to the Bedouins, in the deep horseshoe pits, which occasionally sink down to the underlying floor, and may therefore contain wells. Travelling is slow and laborious owing to the detours and circuits which these pits necessitate, and to the soft texture of the sand. These remarkable hollows, which may be as much as from 2 to 300 feet deep, are the only features of the landscape besides the occasional outcrops of rock which emerge above the sand-bed, and serve as excellent landmarks. There is only one recognized crossing of the sand-barrier which shuts off Jebel Shammar from Syria. Caravans from Damascus bound for Ha'il traverse the Nefud between Jauf and Jebel Aja in from ten to twelve days. The distance between the oases is 266 miles, of which 220 lie over sand desert. The long waterless stage is between Shaqiq and Jubbah, a distance of 160 miles, which usually takes between seventy and ninety hours to accomplish, although it has been done in fifty hours. The only other line which has been followed across the Nefud is that taken by Nolde, who travelled from Jauf along the northern edge of the sands (but inside the Nefud) to Hayyaniyah, and thence southwards to Ha il.THE NORTHERN NEFUD 391 Nolde claimed that this was the shorter route, and that the waterless stage was shorter than that on the Jauf-Jubbah track. As a matter of fact,from our present knowledge of the true position of Hayyaniyah the distances between wells are practically the same, while the total length of the journey is if anything longer. The latter half of this route, between Hayyaniyah and Ha'il, is a recognized track across the eastern end of the Nefud, and connects Jebel Shammar with 'Iraq ; the sand-crossing takes two days and the going is comparatively easy. The only other track in the Nefud of which we have any record is one which is said to lead westwards from Jubbah to Fajar (Eejr) and Tebuk. There would be a waterless stage of 100 miles. Deserted in summer, when the heat becomes intolerable, the Nefud is, in winter and spring, an asylum for all the tribes upon its borders. The sand-area, curiously enough, supports a considerable vegetation. The dunes are more or less covered with large bushes of (tamarisk) and artah (yerta), with scrub such as and 'actor, and with tall succulent grasses, nussi (or nassi), and sobath (or There are also many peculiar parasites that grow on the roots of the ghadha ; these are typical desert growth—full of moisture and greatly sought after by the drinkless fauna. The Nefud grasses afford excellent feed for camels, and are so nourishing in the spring months that these become quite independent of water for many weeks at a time. Thus the Bedouins, living on their camel's milk, are enabled to wander far into the depths of the waterless dunes.. The sands even lend themselves to artificial afforestation. Doughty mentions how he found the ' great dune of Boreyda ' newly planted with ithl (tamarisk) trees. The natives set the young plants in the loose sand and water them for one year. By that time they have struck out long roots and are able to thrive of themselves. ' Planted with tamarisks '—he notes—' the sands of Arabia might become a green wood.' The first rains fall about mid-November, and very soon afterwards the sap begins to run in the twigs of the thorny bushes, and grass and flowering weeds spring up in the sand. The nomads have a great liking for the Nefud, finding, as they do, an abundance of fuel and pasturage. The warm hollows afford them a shelter which is much appreciated after the exposure of the surrounding deserts. There is also comparative immunity from the attacks of raiders ; although the Bedouins also complain that the Nefud is dangerous on account of the ease with which an enemy can track them in the sand. The Bishr. the Wuld 'Ali, 'Awajah, Euqara, Sherarat, &amp;c.,392 NORTHERN NEFUD AND DAHANAH BELTS occupy the western and south-western quarters; the Shammar tribes the south and east; the great Anazah tribes (Amarat and Ruweilah) come into the Nefud from the north. The distribution is however, only typical of normal conditions; Shammar and Ruweilah have been known to meet in conflict on the western confines. The only other nomads likely to be met with in the Nefud are the Sulubba Wild game is abundant in the sand-area. Gazelles, ostriches hares, and innumerable small rodents are to be found, while the Nefud and its confines form the true home of the Arabian oryx (oryxbeatrix) —an antelope allied to the oryx of African fauna. There are several poisonous snakes. The axes of the dunes lie N. and S., and the great horseshoe hollows face the SE. The prevailing winds being from the W. and NW., the dunes have their steep faces towards the E. and SE. This statement applies to the main sand-bed, but on its eastern margin the axes of the dunes gradually swing round until on the Ha'il-Hayyaniyah track they lie E. and W. The prevailing wind between Ha'il and Boreidah appears to be from the S. The ' felj ' pits are by far the most remarkable feature of the Nefud. They are known in different localities by the names of felq, qa 'rah, and qa'r. Felj, or felq, is usually applied to those on the Jauf-Ha'il track. Qa'r ah or Ga'rah (pi. qa'rdt, gar'dt) is used by the Shammar of those in the NE. (pi. is a more general term both for those in the Nefud and those in the Dahanah. There has been considerable discussion as to their origin, and as to peculiar facts relating to them. The prevalent west winds are no doubt the principal agency to which the forma tion can be ascribed, but whether it is by the direct movement of sand from the W., or by a process of scouring-out by back eddies is still undecided. They appear, in many cases, to go right down to the underlying floor of the sand-bed, and some are certainly stationary, for they are habitually used by travellers as camping-grounds and even contain wells. Erom this it would appear that the pits are formed by a different process to that which piles up the moving dunes. In shape they are most regular, being best described as resembling the imprint of a gigantic horse-hoof. In size they vary greatly, some covering a hundred acres, others not more than an acre ; the average depth may be between 150 and 250 ft. They all lie with the deepest part of the horseshoe towards the NW., the sides running out to the SE. Apparently they never vary in this respect, whether they lie in the Nefud dunes which run N. and S., or in the Dahanah belt among dunes trending E. and W. The internal walls are very steep and unstable in theTHE NORTHERN NEFUD 393 middle of the bend, but less so at the sides. The sides are as well covered with vegetation as are the ordinary dunes. The sands lie deepest, and the grains are heaviest, in the western, southern, and central portions ; on the N. and E. the beds become shallower and lighter both in texture and in colour. The character istic hollows and high bare dunes of the centre and W. fade away on the E., the sands assuming a more even surface ; finally the sand-bed breaks up into intermittent dunes and hard desert. The depth of sand in the W. is reckoned at from 200—300 ft., and in the E. at less than 100 ft. The nomenclature of the dunes is somewhat confusing. There is a host of names, which includes terms for every variety of sand formation. Jurdah is applied, in Qasim, to the hard stationary dunes where desert bushes grow ; to the high single dunes, generally bare of vegetation, and also to the little white dunes which accompany a felj; 'adandt and to the light shifting sand; habl is an ordinary sand-hill, and b an isolated patch of Nefud. In colour the sands vary from white to dark red, being heaviest and darkest in the centre and lighter and whiter on the edges. The Nefud is situated at an average altitude of 2,600 ft. above sea-level. On the N. and E. the underlying floor of the Nefud is about 2,000 ft. above sea-level, on the S. and W. it is 3,000 ft. As regards climate, the sand-bed is by no means a rainless area ; travellers have experienced heavy rain-storms and snow, standing pools of rain-water have been seen, while the vegetation on the dunes proves that the sands hold much moisture. The weather is subject to great variation in a short space of time. Shakespear experienced rain, thunder-storms, cold winds, and great heat in April on the northern margin of the sands. Frost is quite usual during the winter nights. The temperature is liable to considerable change during the 24 hours ; great heat at noon may be followed by frost soon after sunset. B. T he D ahanah , A edh el -M adhu', and W oshm N efuds The Dahanah is a term usually applied to belts of sand which, breaking off from the Northern Nefud, lie in_tongues and strips along the eastern borders of Qasim, Sedeir, and 'Aridh, and separate these districts of Nejd from the Gulf provinces of Koweit and Hasa. The term should really be reserved for the middle portion of the most easterly belt, the particular characteristic of the Dahanah being a series of parallel ridges of sand divided from each other by zones of hard bare ground. The ordinary sand-belts composed of continuous dunes, or even confused and shapeless sand-hills, should394 NORTHERN NEFUD AND DAHANAH BELTS uot be included under the same name. The Dahanah belts are for midable barriers in themselves, but they do not cover a single large area, and they do not therefore entail very long waterless stages The principal Dahanah is the belt of sand which breaks away from the Nefud in the neighbourhood of Leinah, and stretches for 600 miles before losing itself in the southern sand desert. At its birth it is H miles broad, but the sands are not deep nor difficult to cross. Where the Persian pilgrim route—the Darb Zobeidah— crosses it, the sands are scarcely noticeable as a land feature; but 40 miles to the E., immediately to the S. of Leinah, it is 15 miles across, the dunes, which run E. and W., being about 50 ft. high, and the crests of the waves about 300 yards apart. There are also modified forms of the ' felj ' pits—so typical of the true Nefud. The Dahanah now sweeps to the SE., and continues in the same 15-mile wide belt for 100 miles, at which point it traverses and bars the great Wadi Rummah. Here it is crossed by the caravans trading between Boreidah and Basra or Koweit, The crossing takes about 4 hours, the dunes rising to 225 ft. above the plain. For another 50 miles the Dahanah keeps the same solid form and the same direction; then the sands begin to spread out and divide into parallel ridges. Sixty-five miles to the SE. of the point where it crosses the Wadi er-Rummah, the sands are 18 miles wide, and are formed into four distinct ridges, separated from each other by bare hard steppe. The sand-ridges vary in width from half a mile to 4 miles, the intervening plains being from half a mile to 5 miles across. A more direct track than the Wadi er-Rummah route here crosses the Dahanah from Koweit to Boreidah by way of Bir es-Safah and Zilfi. Twenty miles farther on the Dahanah is 23 miles across, and is composed of seven belts. The main direction is here ESE. Fifty miles farther it extends to its maximum width—38 miles, but the number of sand-ridges is seven as before, while the width of each dune and of the intervening plains continues to vary. Some are several miles in breadth, and stand from 200 to 300 ft. above the plains, which in their turn vary from 5 to 12 miles in breadth. For the next 120 miles the Dahanah runs in a south-easterly direction, and is unknown ; but just beyond this it is crossed by the Riyadh- Hofuf caravans, and its character is known to have altered. The sands are now in a solid 18-mile wide belt, but the dunes are insig nificant as compared with the Nefud. The Dahanah type—of parallel ridges—has not entirely disappeared, for there seem to be the remnants of other sand-belts on the eastern margin. Slightly to the N. of the Riyadh-Hofuf track there is apparently a widerTHE DAHANAH BELTS 395 stretch of sand, for Pelly reckoned the crossing of it at two days' march. Beyond this point the Dahanah has a direction of SSE., and then nearly due S. ; except for Leachman's crossing of it—40 miles on— it is unknown. By report it continues in the same direction, until it finally merges into the great southern sand-bed—the Ruba' el- Khali. At Leachman's crossing it was 30 miles wide, but it had lost so much of its true character that he was able to describe it as being ' scarcely more than a sandy plain '—the waves being small and the sand of little depth. The general disposition of this sand-area is in a long semicircular barrier shutting off the central tableland of Nejd from the lowlands of 'Iraq and the Gulf Coast. It lies at an average altitude of 1,200 ft. above the sea, and is bordered on the W. by higher ground and on the east by the level plain called Summan. The prevailing winds appear to vary at different localities between S. and W., the trend of the dunes varying accordingly. In the N. they run E. and W., with their steep faces towards the N., ; in the middle section of the Dahanah the dunes run NW. and SE., the steep sides being turned toward the NE. At the Riyadh-Hof uf crossing the dunes lie about N. and S., being formed by westerly winds. The vegetation is remarkably abundant, as in the Nefud, and attracts many nomads to its vicinity, especially in the winter months. The Muteir are almost the exclusive possessors of the Dahanah, but in the southern portions the Murrah and their foes the 'Ajman come at certain seasons into the sands for pasture. In the N. the Dhafir range the deserts to the north of Leinah, and doubtless occasionally use the Dahanah pastures. The Dahanah is the principal sand-area between the Northern Nefud and the Ruba' el-Khali. There are, however, several sub sidiary sand-belts worthy of notice. All of these differ from each other in character. Some are isolated dunes or hummocks of sand, others are miniature Nefuds in themselves, and one is an offshoot of the Northern Nefud. All are consistent in one point, however, namely, that they are all long drawn-out belts of fine sand, having the same general direction as the Dahanah. The belt which has its origin in the Northern Nefud is the 'Ardh el-Madhua ' (Leachman), ' Nefud Matsour' (Huber), or ' Araj Mathur' (Shakespear), i. e. the Ael-Madhu . This tongue of sand breaks off from the main sand-bed between the wells of Methe- yahah and Trobah, in lat. 28° 30' north. It is here 6 miles wide, being of the same width 50 miles to the E. where crossed by Leach man. In character it is more like the true Nefud than the Dahanah. Leachman described it as ' formed of great waves of sand running396 NORTHERN NEFUD AND DAHANAH BELTS east and west, with a difference in level of 151 ft. between trough and crest, while at certain places horseshoe depressions (jWitj) are encoun tered in the trough. The sand is a darker red than the Nefud very heavy, and most difficult to traverse, while the sides of the waves are so precipitous that it is necessary to dismount from one's camel to get over themThe Ardh el-Madhu' is supposed to extend to the Wadi Rummah, and to cease there. It is possible that it connects with the belt called El-Bittah, which must come very close indeed to it on the S. El-Bittah is the northern extension of a long, isolated sand-helt which extends for 235 miles, starting from the borders of Woshm and 'Aridh, and reaching to within 30 miles of the Northern Nefud. It is divided from the Dahanah by the Toweiq uplands, having a general direction of SSE. by NNW. That portion of the belt N. of the Wadi er-Rummah is called El-Bittah. In character it is typical Dahanah, being composed of parallel ridges of sand divided by valleys of hard soil. At its northern end there are seven strips of sand each about a mile broad, in between them being gravelly depressions of the same width. The dunes face N, and their sides are very steep. Farther to the S., on the Boreidah track, is a single down-like wave of sand, 300 ft. high, called supposed to be connected with El-Bittah. The Bittah retains its Dahanah-like character for about 85 miles. The track from Basra, or Koweit, to Boreidah, by way of the Wadi er-Rummah, crosses it as such, but a little farther on the parallel ridges come together into one broad belt. The remainder of El-Bittah is of the Nefud type. Between Zilfi and Boreidah it is a solid sand-ridge, 13 miles broad, characterized by three depressions containing uninhabited palm- groves. The dunes are said by Raunkiaer to trend from SW. to NE. Near Shaqrahthe belt is 8 miles wide, the sands being easy to traverse. Here it is called Areij el-Bildan or Nefud el-Woshm. Within this last belt, 20 miles to the W., is yet another of the same type. We know it for about 100 miles running nearly due N. and S. from Boreidah to lat. 25°. Beyond this point it is entirely un known. East of Boreidah, where it surges to the very edge of the Wadi er-Rummah, it is a 5-mile ridge of big dunes; W. of Shaqrah it is 15 miles across, and more difficult to traverse than the Nefud el-Woshm. The only other sand-area on the eastern confines of Nejd is a small belt in the space between the Temamma and Toweiq ranges, which Pelly recorded on his track between'Urmah(Rumhlyah) and Sedus. This is a 4-mile wide ridge, running parallel to the Temamma range ; apparently the sands are deep, for Pelly speaks of a 'gigantic pyramidal dune{2oo CHAPTER XIII SETTLED TRIBES OF THE NORTH-WEST belqa The Belqa is a district east of Jordan and_the Dead Sea, which extends roughly from Zerqa, north-east of 'Amman (Ammon), to the Wadi Zerqa, south of the ancient Christian village of Madeha, and eastward nearly to Qasr el-Azraq. The Jebel Hauran and the Jebel 'Ajlun bound it on the north. The Beni Sakhr are the predominant tribe in its southern reaches, the Ruweilah penetrate into the eastern pasturages near Azraq, the 'Adwan are paramount over the Jordan valley (the Ghor), the Beq'a (i.e. the hills between the Ghor and the Heshban), and the lands round Heshban. The smaller tribes of the Belqa acknowledge the authority of the prin cipal 'Adwan Sheikh, Sultan ibn 'Ali Dhi'ab, whose head-quarters are at Heshban ; and it will therefore be convenient to treat the whole of the Belqawiyah, including the 'Adwan, under one head. They are a half-settled people, scattered pretty thickly over a comparatively small area ; for though the Belqa is not in extent considerable, it is a country rich in pasturage, with plentiful rains in winter, and supports a much larger population than any corre sponding area of the Hamad. At a moderate reckoning there must be at least 4,500 tents within its confines, in addition to the big villages of Salt, 'Amman, and Madeba, which hold permanently settled inhabitants. 1 It contains much cultivated land and still more which would repay husbandry. The valleys leading down to Jordan are full of timber, oak, terebinth, and smaller trees, and even the uplands might be well wooded, but for the depredations of the goats and charcoal-burners. Round Salt the hill-sides are terraced for vineyards, and the gardens of the sturdy Christian and Moslem population are planted with fruit-trees. The pasture grounds of Heshban are famous, and Madeba, which is still largely Christian, is set in cornfields. At 'Amman an industrious Circassian 1 The villagers themselves are grouped into tribal confederations.398 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE NORTH-WEST colony has filled the valley with gardens and poplar groves con structed roads along which they can drive their two-wheeled carts and covered the slopes of the hills with corn. Innumerable ruin- fields, remains of villages of the Christian period before the Moliam' medan invasion, testify to the fertility of the soil, and its capacitv for carrying a larger population. In the winter the warm Jordan valley is favourable for early crops, and forms an ideal refuge for flocks and herds. 8 Unhappily the edges of the desert suffer notoriously from the shortcomings of the Turkish administration. Since 1895 the Ottoman Government has occupied Kerak and Ma'an, placing a mutesarrif at the former and a kaimmakam at the latter • there are mudirs at Walah, Tafilah, and Shobak, a kaimmakam at Salt and mudirs at Madeba and 'Amman. With the opening of the railway to Ma'an in 1905 communications have been facilitated and small military posts are established along the line. The results have been disappointing. The Belqawiyah, like all the herder tribes, have lost touch with the desert law, though they have not acquired any other code in its place. They maintain a tribal organization and a vast network of tribal feuds in which the Otto man Government seldom interferes, even on behalf of settlers, Circassian, Christian, or Moslem. The whole country is turbulent, crime abounds, and justice is almost non-existent. The villagers protect themselves as best they can, partly by force of arms, but mostly by paying tribute to the Arab Sheikhs in the form of unstinted hospitality and liberal propitiation by gifts in kind. The Circassians, a race detested by the Arabs, incur more hostility from the tribes than other townsfolk, but are also better able to hold their own, being born fighters and well armed. Though the disputes often lead to bloodshed, they are usually small affairs, petty robberies taking the place of raids among the border tribes. But in the summer, when great numbers of the Beni Sakhr come up to the northern pasturages, and the Anazah draw in from the east, the Belqa is the scene of continuous disturbance, ranging from pitched battles to the satisfaction of individual blood-feuds, and no established authority intervenes. Yet it is just in such frontier lands as these that any strong administration would seize its chance, and herein lies the political importance of tribes like the Belqawiyah. They are cultivators, after the inefficient manner of the Arabs, and like all the half- settled people their numbers are surprisingly large in comparison with those of purely nomadic tribes. They have few camels, and those which they possess are bought from the Bedouins, not bredr BELQA 399 by themselves ; but they rear large flocks of sheep and goats, and live richly on their milk during the spring. The fact that they own cultivated ground should give the Government a firm hold over them ; they are immobilized thereby, nor do their pastoral conditions give them the means of rapid transport. Their numbers would make them a solid barrier between their wandering kinsmen, who can slip through the fingers of the law at any moment leaving no pledge behind, and the permanently settled lands. Moreover, their geographical position makes them the first problem to be dealt with, a problem on which the security of wide and fertile regions, now lying to a great extent derelict, must depend. A group of the 'Adwan, some 700 tents, is seated in Mesopotamia at Qorinshar, west of the Khabur. Numerically the largest of the Belqa tribes are the Beni Hasan, who are sometimes counted among the Jebeliyah since they are an offshoot from one of that group, the Ghiyadh. They go up into the slopes of the Druze hills, and sometimes wander into the volcanic country to the east. The Shawabkah, as their name indicates, come from Shobak and are a new tribe ; but the 'Adwan are an old confederation tracing their descent through Qeis to Mudhar, a respectable lineage. The 'Ajarmah venerate an ancestor, Sobah, who, they relate, came from lands farther east. His son, 'Ajram, is the eponymous founder of the tribe. No doubt all the Belqawiyah are, like the 'Adwan, Ahl esh- Shimal, and though their own stories of their parentage are mere legend and usually devoid of any historic basis, it is reasonable to conjecture that they must have taken part in the gradual sweep northwards of the Hejaz tribes after the Mohammedan conquest. They displaced and even wholly obliterated the powerful Yemenite nation of the Beni Ghassan, which held the marches for the Roman Empire along the Hauran harrahs and in the Belqa, just as the Ghassanids had stepped into the place of the Nabataeans and tribes of the Safa, whose Aramaic dialects, attested by countless graffiti, link them with the civilization of Eastern Arabia and the frontiers of Mesopotamia. It is conceivable that the legendary origin of the 'Ajarmah from an Eastern ancestor may have some real founda tion in history, and that they may be connected with strata of culture long since submerged by later migrations, which go back to the last centuries before the Christian era. The Sirhan, now a small tribe scattered over the Belqa, the Jordan valley, and the Southern Hauran hills, are reckoned to be of the best Northern Arab blood, though they have fallen to low estate They owned the whole of the Wadi Sirhan, which isKERAK AND SHOBAK t 403 Kerak and Shobak The Arabs of the Kerak-Shobak district were long the bane of all travellers and entirely beyond official control. They are noted robbers, cruel, faithless, and intractable. Since the establishment of a Turkish Mutesarrif at Kerak and a Kaimmakam at Shobak, they have been reduced to some sort of order ; but in the autumn of 1910 the Majaliyah of Kerak revolted, tore up the Hejaz Railway in several places, killed the employes, held up the trains, and stripped the passengers. They were severely repressed by Sami Pasha, who called all the Bedouins as far as Ma c an to account, including the Huweitat. His energetic action has not yet faded entirely from memory. All the tribes of this group are cultivators and sheep-breeders. Those who have houses in Kerak or Shobak send out their flocks into the desert in spring. The Shobak Arabs exact tribute from the Kerak people^ The list here given is taken from Jaussen, who explains that the word house, used as a unit in his computation, implies the patriarchal family, including the married sons with their wives and families.

Ashraf i' The Ashraf (Sherifial clansmen) in general are the descendants of Hasan, who was son of 'Ali and Eatimah, and, through the latter, grandson of the Prophet. There are said to be twenty-one clans of this descent scattered over Arabia, of which fifteen live wholly or in part in Hejaz or North-West Asir, and chiefly in and near Mecca. Eor the most part numerically small, they derive impor tance from the consideration which their individual members enjoy throughout Arabia. Theoretically, the Emirs (Grand Sherifs) of Mecca might be chosen from any clan of the Ashraf : but, in fact, they have belonged to one or another branch of the descendants of Abu Numej (who was of the Qatadah stock) for so many centuries that nowadays succession to this office is, in practice, as much confined by prescription to two or three clans only as the Sultanate of Turkey is to the house of 'Othman. The mutual affinities, the interconnexion, and the present con dition of the Ashraf clans are not well known ; and many of them are mere names to us. (a) 'Abddilah is the ruling clan at present, being that to which the Emir (Grand Sherif) and his house belong. It is descended from Sherif 'Abdullah, grandson of Mohammed Abu Numej (1631). It was raised to power by Mohammed 'Ali of Egypt in 1827 during his occupation of Hejaz, in place of the Dhawi Zeid who had held the throne since the latter part of the eighteenth century and also at an earlier epoch. In the earlier eighteenth century the Emirate had been with the Dhawi Barakat. The 'Abadilah clan of Hejaz is entirely settled, the bulk of it living outside Mecca south of the Jiddah road. Many of its members hold office under the Emir. There is another branch in Asir (see p. 407) and scattered families are found in other parts of Arabia. (6) Dhawi Zeid. The Dhawi Zeid clan, which descends from Zeid, great-great-grandson of Mohammed Abu Numej, is settled in1oS ASHRlF 407 Mecca. The houses of 'Abd el-Mutallib and Ghalib are of the Dhawi Zeid clan, and there is rivalry and bad feeling between it and the 'Abadilah. The only members of the clan who live at Mecca are Sherif Zeid, son of Feisal, a young man of about twenty, and the Sherifah Azza, daughter (?) of Sherif 'Aun er-Rafiq. The latter appears to be a woman of considerable character with a keen interest in politics and some power over the Harb. She is unmarried and about sixty years old. The Dhawi Zeid own a large amount of property in Mecca and Jiddah and possess many slaves. (c) Shenabrah. The Shenabrah descend from an eponymous Sherif, Shanbar, not of a ruling house. They are nomadic, and are dealt with on p. 72. (d) Dhawi Surur. The Dhawi Surur are descendants of Sherif Surur, who ruled as Emir in the latter part of the eighteenth cen tury. They are nomadic, and are treated on p. 72. (e) Dhawi Baralcdt. The Dhawi Barakat, descendants of Bara- kat, third son of Mohammed Abu Numej, are no longer in Hejaz proper, where they held the supreme power up to the latter part of the eighteenth century and, at a slightly later period, were robbers in Wadi Fatimah. They are said by Burckhardt to have been exhausted by family wars of succession. They are now found in North-Western Asir organized as a tribe. (/) Dhawi Hasan. Descendants of Hasan, second son of Moham med Abu Numej, are also no longer in Hejaz, but in North-Western Asir organized as a tribe (see p. 426). Other Ashraf clans of Hejaz, e. g. Hurith, M enema,Dhawi Jizdn, Dhaw Judallah, Ibrahim, and Dhawi'Amr, are, apparently, not of actual political importance. For the Ja'afirah of Asir see p. 429. Ashraf are numerous and powerful in Yemen, in the districts of Mareb and Harib, and in Wadyan Dawasir ; but, as is natural, they are most conspicuous and best known in Hejaz. B. A sir 1. 'Abddi One of the twenty one clans of Ashraf. 1. By far the more important section is that settled in Mecca, on which see previous section. 2. There is a small colony of them which has been settled for &gt;408 SETTLED TRIBES OE THE WEST many generations in the Beni Qutabah country of the Rijal el-M 'a Their influence is local and unimportant. Sherif 'Abd ibn 'Abdullah is their leading representative. 3. Another small colony has lived for many years with the Dhawi Barakat, about four hours east of Shakkat el-Yemeniyah They are allied with the Dhawi Barakat and friendly with the Zobeid. Their chief Sheikh is Sherif Talib ibn Qasim. 2. Ben'Ahs The Beni 'Abs inhabit the country between Wadi Habl on the north and Wadis 'Ain and Warith on the south. Their territory extends from the sea to the first foot-hills some 25 miles inland and is bounded on the north by the Beni Hasan, on the east by Beni Aslam, and on the south by the Wa'zat. They are from the people of the north and trace their descent from Adnan through 'Abs the son of Ghatafan, the son of Qeis, the son of Mudhar. They say that they originally came from the Hejaz, and after moving south at some unknown period to Beit el-Eaqih, they again passed north about 600 years ago till they came to their present territory. There is still a small remnant of the tribe, whose present Sheikh is Sheikh Bekhat, near Beit el-Eaqih, immediately to the north of the powerful tribe of Zaranik. The northern 'Abs can put into the field about 3,000 good fighting men well armed with Mausers and Martinis, and are enthusiastic adherents of Idrisi. In 1915 Yahya 'Ali ibn Thawab, their paramount Sheikh, was joint commander of Idrisi's second army opposed to the Turkish forces near Loheia. With Ahmed ibn El-Heij, the chief of the Wa'zat and the main local supporter of the Turks, the 'Abs have a long-standing feud. Between them and the Beni Aslam there is an enmity which leads to frequent fighting when the rest of the world is at peace, but which is laid aside when the interests of their common lord, Idrisi, demand. With the Beni Zeid, who are the allies of the Beni Aslam, their relations are the same. They stand to the Beni Hasan as protectors and friends and range freely over their country up to Wadi Heir an. They are partly nomad and partly settled and trading, and though less in number than the Wa'zat, they are richer. They sow enough grain for their needs and trade with the tribesmen from the hills, taking from them skins and coffee, and selling to them articles of clothing and the like which in times of peace they bring from Loheia and Hodeidah. Their two chief villages are Suq el-Himari and Suq 'Abs, where every Friday and Sunday respectively are held marketsASIR 409 to which the neighbouring tribesmen come.

'Alqam el- The 'Alqam el-Hul occupy a narrow strip of country beginning about 2 miles north of Ibha and running out to the west for about 20 miles. The Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah adjoin them on the north, the Beni Malik on the east, the Beni Mugheid on the south, and the Rijal el-M'a on the west. They are divided into two sections, 'Alqam es-Sahil near Ibha and 'Alqam el-'Alein to the west. Each of these numbers about 2,000 men. The chief Sheikh of the 'Alqam es-Sahil is Ahmed ibn Hamid, a prosperous man of about 45, who is a member of the ' Mejlis Belfedi' at Ibha. The A1 Yusuf are noted for the beauty of their women, many of whom are married to Turks. The 'Alqam el-'Alein are not on good terms with the 'Alqam es-Sahil, and their Sheikh, Abu Matir, a man of 65, is said to have pro-Idrisi tendencies. The tribe is, however, thoroughly under the control of the Turks and pays its taxes regularly. It is generally on bad terms with the Beni Malik and Beni Mugheid, although there can be no actual .fighting, and is friendly with the Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah, the Beni Qeis, and the Beni Zeidin section of the Rijal el-M'a.

They have always been violently anti-Turk and about ten years ago, under Sa'id ibn 'Othman, defeated a strong Turkish column led by Mohammed Amin Pasha which was sent to subdue them. They pay allegiance to Idrisi, but not to the extent of allowing him to levy taxes. They are allied with the Bulqarn and have an old feud with the Ka'b, Beni Kerim, and Neid sections of the Beni Shihir. The tribe traces its descent to the Rijal el-Hajar. Paramount Sheikh : Sa'id ibn 'Othman esh-Shij. 2,000 men. Clans :— The Bahr Ibn Sekeinah live along the Muha'il-Birk road from about 9 miles south-west of Muha'il to within 18 miles of Birk, a distance of approximately 29 miles. They are bounded on the north by the A1 Musa, on the east first by the Beni Thuwwah and then by the Rijal el-M'a, on the south by the Rijal el-M'a, and on the west by the Beni Hilal. They number 1,000 men, of whom 600 are settled and the rest, the Latim and the Makhlutah, nomad. They share with the Beni TTilal the reputation of being one of the most unregenerate and irresponsible tribes of Asir, and the nomads are still Moslems merely in name, though the influence of Idrisi during the past few years has done something to reform them. They have never acknowledged the sway of the Turk nor have the latter been able to subdue them. Their country in the highlands of Asir is thickly forested, abounding in running streams, but only a little has been cleared for cultivation. Their paramount Sheikh is Seyyid Mustafa, a man of 35 years of age, and one of the most prominent figures in Asir. He belongs to a family of Seyyids and not to the tribe itself. In 1912 Idrisi placed him in supreme command of the forces opposing the Turks and the Sherif of Mecca. When the fighting was over, the Rijal el-M'a, who will suffer no outsider, complained to Idrisi against his being put over them and even went so far as to try to murder him. He has his own tribesmen thoroughly under control and is A1 Suleiman Udheidat Beni Rafi' A1 esh-Sheikh Ahl Jebel el-Mutla Mukhasir ibn Mohammed. 'Abd ibn Talhah. Dhuleim ibn Bukheikh.

He is responsible for collecting tribute for Idrisi and, reserving for himself a quarter of all he receives, has grown rich and lives in some state in Jannah. The most serious engagement in the war of 1912 took place at 'Ayadi in his country, resulting in a check for Idrisi. The Bahr Ibn Sekeinah claim kinship with the Rijal el-M'a and are usually on good terms with them. They reckon the Beni Thuwwah amongst their friends, but are always at feud with the Beni Hilal and A1 Musa. Chief Sheikh : Seyyid Mustafa. Villages : 600 men.

Bal The Balahmar live in the rich highland country to the north of Ibha, their southern boundary coming to within 10 miles of that town. The tribes which adjoin them are on the north the Balasmar, on the east the Shahran, on the south the Beni Malik, and on the west the Rabl'ah wa Rufeidah. The tribe is a strong one and numbers about 7,000 men, of whom 4,000 are settled, the rest nomad. Their country is well watered and produces fruits as well as cereals. The paramount Sheikh of the settled portion is Abdullah ibn Milhem, a young man of 25, who is liked by the tribe both for his justice and the open house which he keeps. He is a warm supporter of Idrisi and collects taxes for him. 'Ali ibn Abshan, or 'Ali Ghalib Bey as the Turks call him, is the nominal head of all the nomads, but for the last few years he has only had the A1 Asia under his control. In his younger days he went to Constantinople and received a military training for five years. On his return to Asir with the rank of Bimbashi he was appointed by the Turks chief tax-collector for the whole district. When Idrisi revolted he stood by the Government, but was not supported by the Balahmar who, with the exception of the A1 Asia,v ASIR 413 all went over to Idrisi. For the last few years he has lived en tirely at Ibha, fearing to go back to his country. He had a house in the village of Melahah in the Beni Malik district, which was razed to the ground a few years ago by Sheikh Seyyid Mustafa of the Bahr Ibn Sekeinah, the chief general of Idrisi in Asir. His son 'Ali was one of the first to be chosen to sit in the Ottoman Parliament, but on his return from Constantinople was captured between Qunfudah and Ibha by the Idrisi's men and died in captivity at Sabia about six years ago. 'Ali ibn 'Abshan himself is now about 55 years of age and is said to be brave and capable. The Balahmar say that they are descended from the Eijal el- Hajar; but they are probably from some other stock, since they are fairer than other Arabs and most of them have red hair, which they wear short, and light eyelashes. The villagers have a reputation for cowardice, but the nomads are stout fighters. The whole tribe, however, has an evil name for treachery and theft and are known amongst other tribes as ' Kilab en-Na'al', intimating that as a dog in the night they will steal the shoes from their sleeping guests. The Balahmar are friends with the Balasmar, Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah, and Beni Malik, but are enemies of the Shahran. (a) Settled. 4,000 men. Paramount Sheikh: 'Abdullah ibn Milhem.

Ba The Bal'aryan or ' Sons of nakedness ' have received their name from the poor and savage conditions under which they live. Thev appear to be mostly of African extraction and, save for a few miserable villages, they are nomads. Their exact boundaries have not been ascertained, but it is known that they have the Ghamid on the north, the Bulqarn et-Tihamah on their east, the Beni Shihir on their south, and the Zobeid on their west. They are divided into four sections, the Bal'aryan, Beni 'Isa, Beni Suleim, and Beni Suheim, and are said to number 6,000 men! In normal times they quarrel amongst themselves, but unite when danger from outside threatens. They reckon all their neighbours as foes, but have been known to help the Shamran against the Ghamid. The Beni 'Isa pay a nominal allegiance to Idrisi, which means that they help him in war if there is a prospect of loot, and in peace refuse to pay him taxes. The other sub-tribes are completely independent and refuse to recognize the authority of any one. There are many of these tribesmen scattered all over the country as far as Muha'il and Birk, plying the trade of butchers. Although respected for their bravery, they are despised by all true Arabs for their mixed blood and their lack of religion, which almost amounts to paganism. Sub-tribes :— Bal'aryan, 2,500 men, mostly nomad. Beni Tsa, 1,200 men, mostly settled. Bern Suleim, 2,000 men, mostly nomad. Beni Suheim, 600 men, mostly nomad. 8. Bal The Balasmar are a strong tribe, reported to number some 9,000 men, and situated due east of Muha'il, from which they are divided by the Jleish. The adjoining tribes are the Beni Shihir on the north, the Shahran on the east, the Balahmar on the south, and the Reish on the west. They are said to be descended from the Rijal el-Hajar, and are of the same stock as the Beni Shihir. They dwell on the fertile slopes of the hills and up to the long ascent known as the 'Aqabah Sajein to the top of the main ridge of Asir, and are known accordingly as people of the mountains or people of the Tihamah. Much coffee is grown on the hill terraces, and wheat and other cereals round the villages.ASIR 415 Jebel Hadhah is the chief centre of the tribe and the most pro ductive. The Ibha-Ta'if road runs through their territory for about seven miles between Madfa'ah and Tanumah. The paramount Sheikh of the whole tribe is 'Ali ibn Mohammed, a man of 50, tall and powerful, with a scar over the right eyebrow. He lives at Madfa'ah and is a firm adherent of Idrisi, as are the rest of the tribe. Idrisi takes taxes from them. In former days Turkish influence reached them, but since Idrisi's rise to power they have been left alone. The Balasmar are friendly with the Balahmar and the Beni Shihir ; with the Reish and Shahran they are at enmity. Their reputation for hospitality and prowess in war is good. 'Ali ibn Ra'ih is the mufti of the tribe, a dark-skinned man of about 55 with a long flowing beard. He is said to have Turkish leanings, and is on bad terms with 'Ali ibn Mohammed, but he is sound in his judgements and generous, and is liked by the tribe.

Ahl _The four tribes of Humeidah, Al Musa ibn 'Ah, Al Isba'i, and Al Jebali are known collectively in Asir as the Ahl Barak, and it will therefore be convenient to class them together, although they416 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST do not form a confederation or trace their descent to the same ancestors. The district of Barak begins about 15 miles north of Muha'il, and covers an area of about 20 miles from north to south and 30 miles from east to west. It is a fertile country with plentiful rains and is largely cultivated, simsim being the principal crop. It is bounded on the north and east by the Beni Shihir, on the south by the Reish, Al Dureib, and Rabi'at et-Tahahin, and on the west by the Rabi'ah Mujatirah. The most important tribe is the Humeidah numbering 7,000 men, of whom 4,000 are nomads. They occupy the western part of the district, and the Muha'il-Qunfudah road from Dhahab to Ghar el-Hindi is in their territory. They quarrel with the Al Isba'i and are divided amongst themselves, the vil lagers favouring the Turks, the nomads Idrisi. Mohammed ibn Hayazah is their Sheikh, and the paramount Sheikh of the whole district by the nomination of Idrisi. He is a man of about 45, and has the reputation of using his position with wisdom and moderation. The Al Musa ibn 'Ali occupy the south-eastern portion of the district along the first stages of the Barak-Tanumah road, and number about 3,000 men. They are entirely sedentary and agri cultural, and disagree with the Al Jebali. They are friendly with the Reish and the pro-Idrisi section of the Al Musa. The Al Isba'i are between the Al Musa ibn 'Ali and the Humeidah and north of the Al Jebali. Both the Al Isba'i and Al Jebali are entirely settled in villages. Taken as a whole the tribes support Idrisi, with the exception of the settled Humeidah, and pay him taxes. They are peaceful and pleasure-loving, and by no means fond of war. At the same time they are not above harrying small Turkish convoys. The road from Muha'il to Qunfudah, however, is so beset with unfriendly tribes that the Turks seldom pass over it except in numbers suffi ciently large to repel any ordinary attack. Humeidah.

DhawiBarakdt The Dhawi Barakat are one of the tribes of Ashraf related to the Qoreish. They occupy a barren stretch of the sea-coast from Shakkat esh-Shamiyah and about 25 miles south, and extend inland for about 14 miles. The Wadi Dokhah runs through their country and provides water for their annual crop of and dhura. They number only 400 men, but make up for their paucity of numbers by their reckless daring. Coastal dhows give their shores a wide berth, for they live chiefly on what they can make by piracy, and in their swift vessels take toll of all who come their way. Their chief is Sherif Hasan Abu Mandil, a man about 45 years old, who recognizes the authority of neither the Sherif, the Turks, nor the Idrisi. His right-hand ARABIA I JJ (J418 SETTLED TEIBES OF THE WEST man and the one most noted in raiding is Sherif Mohammed ibn Sa'idah. They maintain a perpetual feud with their piratical rivals the Dhawi Hasan, but are on friendly terms with the Zahran, their eastern neighbours, and with the Zobeid to their south. There is a small colony of 'Abadilah Ashraf in their country, which is allied to them. An offshoot of the tribe lives at Manadil in the Bela'ir country.

The Bela'ir are a strong and truculent tribe inhabiting the country roughly from between Khabt el-'Umr and Jum'at Eabi'ah to Habil and Joz Bela'ir, on the Qunfudah-Barak road. They are bounded on the north and north-east by the Zobeid, east by the Rabi'ah Mujatirah, south-east by the Rabi'at et-Tahahin, south by the Aulad el-'Alaunah, and west by the Marahibah section of the Beni Zeid. They are divided into main divisions, the Nawashirah, 3,000 men, and the 'Umr, 4,000, the former partly settled, the latter entirely nomad, and ranging the country to the south of their borders. Their situation astride the two main roads from Qun- fudah to Muha'il is an excellent one for raiding, and they take full advantage of it. They hate the Turks, who can only pass through their country in force. The chief Sheikh is 'Ali ibn Medini, a man of 50, who was formerly paramount Sheikh of the whole tribe. He was bought over by the Sherif of Mecca in 1912, and his desertion of the Idrisi lost him the support of all the 'Umr and of the Nawashirah with the exception of the Eirshah and Sa'dah clans and the inhabitants of the village of Joz Bela'ir. The tribe is still split in two, and Sheikh Ibn Kheirah of the Nawashirah has gathered most of the power into his hands, and is reckoned amongst the Idrisi adherents.ASIR 419 Their country includes both plain and hills, and is rich enough to give pasture for large herds of camels, goats, and cattle, and to grow cereals in the rainy season. They are allied with the Zobeid, but are generally at loggerheads with their other neighbours. The most extreme section and the one most feared by travellers is a colony of about 300 of the Dhawi Barakat, called the Ashraf Manadil, living at Manadil, just to the west of Joz Bela'ir, on the main road to Qunfudah. They have lived there for many years and have severed all connexion with their parent tribe, but they have retained the tribal reputation for lawlessness. Their chief is Sherif Abu Talib, who pays allegiance to 'Ali ibn Medini. The colony, however, keeps to itself and does not intermarry with the Bela'ir, nor does it adopt the local custom of allowing its women to go unveiled. The Bela'ir Arabs are lax in their marriage customs, but they do not marry outside their own tribe. Although truculent and quarrelsome, they have a reputation for clean fighting, and are hospitable to those with whom they are not at feud. Paramount Sheikh ; 'Ali ibn Medini of Joz Bela'ir.

Bulq d d 2420 SETTLED TRIBES OP THE WEST nomads of Beni Shihir, on the south by the Beni 'Amr and Beni Shihir, and on the west by the Bel'aryan and Ghamid. The Bulqarn es-Serrah are two-thirds settled and one-third nomad, the Sheikh over all being Mash'ad ibn Bahran, who lives at 'Alayah, a large village about eight hours west of Qal'ah Bishah. He is a rich landowner and also possesses date-groves in Bishah. The country appears to be fertile and well wooded, and supports large herds of camels, goats, and cattle. The nomads draw in to the cultivation during its season, and when it has been harvested take flour to Bishah, which they exchange for dates. There is a general truce with the Shahran amongst all the tribes during the date season at Bishah, which lasts about four months. At other times the Bulqarn are at feud with the Shahran, Beni Shihir, Ghamid, and Shamran. They are friendly to the Khath'am and Beni 'Amr. The Bulqarn el-Yemen occupy the lowland district of 'Urdiyah and are wholly given up to farming. Their chief Sheikh is Mujarri ibn Said. The two sections of the tribe are friendly and help each other in war. They are not remarkable for their courage, but can render a good account of themselves. In politics they all favour the Idrisi and pay him taxes. They are hospitable in character, and passage through their country is generally safe. A. Bulqarn esh-Shdm or es -Serrah. 6,000 men.

They occupy about ten miles of the Sikkat el-Helawiyah from_Muha'il to Qunfudah between the villages of Turqush and Ma'mal Al Ikhleif, and stretch up along the Barak road for about five miles north of Musabbah, which is in their territory. They are bounded on_the north by the Al Musa, west by the Reish, south-east by the Al Musa, south by the Beni Hilal, and west by the Rabi'at et-Tahahin. They are a good fighting race, but are not naturally quarrelsome or bellicose. The Idrisi, how ever, frequently incites them to cut Turkish communications. Their_country is fertile, and they possess many fiocks and herds. The Al Musa and Rabi'at et-Tahahin are friendly to them, the Al Jebali, Reish, and Beni Hilal as a rule inimical. They have the reputation of being hospitable beyond the ordinary, and travellers can journey without fear in their country. There is a small offshoot of their nomad subsection, the Al Ikhleif, situated in the Rabl'ah Mujatirah country near Ghar el-Hindi, who have cut themselves adrift from the main tribe. Mohammed ibn 'Amr Akhu 'Abdiyah, a man of 35, is the chief Sheikh. He has been to Mecca several times, and frequently goes to Sabia. During his absence the tribe is governed by his sister 'Abdi yah, who married a Turkish officer, now dead, named 'Ali Bey Rida. Chief Sheikh : Mohammed ibn 'Amr Akhu 'Abdiyah. 800 men.

The Ghamid own a wide stretch of territory in the highlands of Southern Hejaz and Northern Asir, roughly from latitude 19° 30' to 20° 15' and longitude 41° 30' to 42°. The tribes which adjoin them are, on the north the Shalawah, east Shamran, south Bulqarn and Bel'aryan, and west Zobeid and Zahran. It is difficult to estimate their numbers, reports varying from Burckhardt's estimate of 5,000 to 10,000 fighting men, to a native estimate of 60,000 men. The first is probably as wrong as the last, but there seems no doubt that they are considerably more numerous than any of their neighbours. The inland road from Ibha to Ta'if runs through the midst of their country, which is well watered and fertile. The tribe is divided into two portions, the nomad and settled, who are always at odds with one another. The nomads are A1 Seyah, a tall race of fine fighters who live to the north of the settled portion and roam far afield to the Shalawah country round Turabah, to Ranyah, Tathlith, and Wadi Dawasir. They are rich in horses, camels, and goats, and recognize no authority. Their chief is Mohammed ibn 'Abd er-Rahman, a man of about 45, and a noted warrior. He is entirely independent of outside influences. The chief of the settled Arabs is 'Aziz ibn Musheit, a young man of 25 years of age, who follows the Sherif of Mecca and frequently visits him. He is at enmity with Mohammed ibn Abd er-Rahman. A large number of his men go yearly to Mecca, Jiddah, and Ta'if and act as porters during the pilgrim season. They remain there for about four months, and return with supplies for the rest of the year. Many invest their savings in rifles, which they buy at one of the two chief markets, Ru'eis near Jiddah or Nuzulah Beni Malik. They also buy rifles from the Rijal el-M'a. Although not noted for their fighting skill they yet are frequently at war, their chief foes being the Zahran, and after them the Bel'aryan, Bulqarn, Shamran, and Shahran. The A1 Seyah, who are the better fighters, combine with them when trouble with the Zahran arises. Their friends are the Zobeid and Beni Malik of Hejaz. Their women occupy a much more important position than in most tribes, and take an equal share in all harder forms of manual labour, and even have a say in the tribal councils. The tribe is still nicknamed the Khadimin ed-Derwishah, after a woman who died about fifty years ago, having ruled them for nearly 40 years. The women also weave camel's-hair garments and blankets. OwingASIR 423 to the annual migration to the Hajj, the tribe is more civilized than most and has a good reputation for hospitality. In May 1915 some of their Sheikhs, whose names are not known, wrote to the Idrisi proposing to join him. The Idrisi advised them to keep quiet until a more favourable moment arrived, but sent a Qadhi to collect money from them. At the beginning of 1916 he was still in communication with them. A man of importance in the tribe is Salih ibn 'Ajalah. He is the richest merchant and controls most of the trade between Mecca and the Ghamid. The export of tobacco, of which a considerable amount is grown, is entirely in his hands. Another man of influence is Mohammed ibn 'Ali of the Beni Kebir. He was chosen as one of the representatives of Asir in the Ottoman Parliament ten years ago, and went to Constantinople for one session. Not liking the life, he resigned his seat, but still keeps up his Turkish connexions.

AMHali The Ahl Hali consist of four tribes, which may conveniently be considered together, since, although of different origin, they are politically one, sharing the same country, uniting against common enemies, and being ruled over by one chief. Their country embraces the coastal village of Hali and the district round of the same name The boundary starts from the coast about five miles north of Hali^ runs north-east along the Beni Ya'lah territory, and thence follows a line parallel to the Hali-Jum'ah Rabi'ah road and about four miles to the west, up to Kidwah, which is 18 miles NNE. from Hali and close to the boundary of the 'Umr section of the Bela'ir. Thence it goes south-east for about ten miles along the Rabi'at et- Tahahin and Beni Dhi'b territory to Kiyah, which is 21 miles NE, of Hali. Here it reaches the Beni Hilal and follows their line towards the coast, which it touches about 12 miles south of Hali. ^ The four tribes are the Abid el-Emir, Ghawanimah, Aulad el- Alaunah, and Kinanah, who are all settled with the exception of the Salalimah clan of the Abid el-Emir and the Fellahah clan of the Aulad 'Alaunah, both small and unimportant units. The largest tribe is the Aulad el-Alaunah, who number 3,000 men and are strung out along the Jum'ah Rabi'ah road from Kidwah to Minjiyah. Next in importance are the Ghawanimah (1,600) from Radha to Kha'i along the Muha'il road, then Kinanah from the Beni Hilal to Minjiyah, and finally the Abid el-Emir (600 men) on the Beni Dhi'b frontier. The paramount Sheikh over all is Ibn Aji, a man of about 55, who in the past was a friend of the Turks, but seceded to the Idrisi when the latter began to grow powerful. The Turks used to occupy Hali, but they were driven out sixteen years ago, and have been unable to regain a footing. The confederation is a rich one, havingAsm 425 sufficient water for its agricultural needs and possessing large herds of cattle. They are noted warriors and maintain feuds with all their neigh bours. The Rijal el-M'a are the only tribe whom they regard with friendly eyes. Their relations towards each other are at times strained, but they unite for common defence and when the Idrisi calls them out. The 'Abid el-Emir were originally slaves of Sudanese stock, but have long since gained their emancipation and now rank on an equality with the Arabs. A number of them go every year on the Pilgrimage to Mecca, where they have an evil reputation for robbery and theft. The Kinanah are an ancient and famous tribe, who probably came into being about a. d . 100, and are descended from the Mudhar branch of Nizar. The Qoreish are a branch of them. They were at first settled near Mecca, and took a prominent part against Mohammed the Prophet, by whom they were subdued. When Africa was invaded part of the tribe went to the Sudan, where they are still found in Kordofan, while others went to Egypt and from there pushed as far west as Morocco. The Arabian remnant had meantime taken up their residence near Hali, where they were reported to be by Ibn Batutah in 1353. Some severe fighting took place in the Hali country during the campaign of the Sherif of Mecca and the Turks, in 1910, in which the Ahl Hali 3 who were fighting for the Idrisi, gave a good account of themselves.

Dhawi The Dhawi Hasan occupy the coast-line from just north of Lith down to Shakkat esh-Shamiyah, a distance of about 46 miles, and inland to the beginning of the mountains, which are here only a tew miles from the sea. They are of Sherifial stock and connected witn the Qoreish, but they do not reflect credit on the tribe, for they pay small attention to religion and concentrate all their energies on piracy, being the most notorious band of freebooters and sea -robbers along the whole coast. The Turks have a garrison about two hours inland from their main town of Lith, and exercise a certain res rainasir 427 over them; but the Dhawi Hasa'n hate both the Turks and the Sherif, and what little deference they show to any one is paid to the Idrisi, who is sufficiently far away to be attractive. Sherif Mustur repre sents the Sherif at Lith, and collects a certain amount of taxes. The chief of the tribe is Sherif Mohammed ibn Hasan ibn el-'Aud, whose name is known with dread by every sailor along the coast. Almost equally feared are his followers, Sherif Isma'il Abu Khurfan, Sherif Rajib ibn Dajhid, and Murzut ibn Bekhit, a Sudanese slave who won his freedom by his skill in raiding. They are friendly with the Zahran and Juhadlah, their eastern and northern neigh bours, but have a long-standing feud with the Dhawi Barakat, who lie to their south. The Dhawi Hasan possess many slaves, and the cruelty with which they are treated is notorious in the Hejaz. Blacks captured at sea are invariably enslaved and hamstrung to minimize their chance of escape. Chief Sheikh : Sherif Mohammed ibn Hasan ibn el-'Aud. 3,000 men. The Beni Hasan inhabit the country between Wadis Heiran and Habl from the sea to about 20 miles inland and are bounded on the north by the Beni Marwan, on the south by the Beni 'Abs, and on the east by the Beni Zeid. They are firm friends of the Beni 'Abs, who protect them and range over their country, and they keep on good terms both with the Beni Zeid, whom they fear, and with the Beni Marwan. In number about 2,000 souls, they can put 500 fighting men into the field. Manjur is their chief village, about 20 miles ESE. of Midi; Hasan es-Sa'id and Musa Hasan their chief Sheikhs The Beni Hilal occupy a broad expanse of country stretching from the Sikkat esh-Sheraf between Hali and Muha'il to Birk on the sea-shore.

On the north they are bounded by the Rabi'at et-Tahahin and Al ed-Dureib. From Sirr the boundary goes south-west to Birk, marching first with the Al Musa, and finally near the coast with the Munjahah. The coast is theirs for about 18 miles north of Birk, and then the boundary goes inland and so up to Sabt es- Sawalah along the Hali border. The country is densely wooded and provides pasturage for large herds_of camels and goats. The tribe is divided into the Ahl Birk, the Al Ikhtarsh^ who live in the direction of Muha'il, and are subdivided into the Al Misjar and Al TT m m Jam'ah, and the Arabs of the western parts whose sub divisions have not been ascertained. The Al Ikhtarsh are said to number 5,000 men, and the remainder, including the Ahl Birk, 7,000. The Ahl Birk and the Arabs inhabiting the villages along the sea- coast, such as Nakhl el-Birk, Nahud, and Sobakhah, form the only respectable portion of the tribe. They cultivate a little, grow date- trees in some of the villages, and supplement this by collecting salt near Birk, which they sell to their neighbouring tribes. Mohammed ibn 'Abdu is the chief Sheikh, a man of 35 years of age and a staunch adherent of the Idrisi. He is nominal chief over the whole tribe, and does in fact have considerable influence over them. But to keep them entirely in check is almost an impossibility, for they have the well-earned reputation of being one of the wildest and most intractable tribes of the Asir. Almost pagan, they lead an entirely nomadic life, subsisting on meat and milk and buying what little they need from outside. They have closed the Sikkat esh-Sheraf to the Turks, who are obliged to travel by the more northern roads, the Sikkat el-Helawiyah or the Barak road, and even ordinary travellers do not dare to pass through their country except in large armed parties. As far as they may be said to have any politics, they are pro-Idrisi, but they are far too out of hand to be of value as allies. They are at daggers drawn with all the neighbouring tribes with the exception of the Rijal el-M'a, whose hand they fear. . 'Ali ibn 'Abdu, the Sheikh of Birk, was recently reported to be in the pay of the Turks, and to be smuggling mails up to Ibha, but the well-known attitude of the tribe renders this improbable. ^ In 1910 the Sherif tried to suborn him with the offer of £3,000. All ibn 'Abdu's only reply was to send him a Mauser cartridge. Mohammed ibn Hasan, chief of the Al Ikhtarsh, is a notorious highwayman, and has a most unsavoury reputation for treachery and cunning.asir 429 1. AMBirk. Chief Sheikh : Mohammed ibn 'Abdu, of Birk.

KhatJkam The Khath'am are a small settled tribe on the Ibha-Ta'if road, with the Shamran to their north and west and the Bulqarn to their east and south. They do not muster more than 1,500 men and are partly nomadic. The chief village of the settled portion is Lasfar, where lives their chief Sheikh, Juheish ibn 'Aqad, an old man of 60. The nomads are camel-owners, and are almost all engaged in the carrying trade to Bishah and Namas. They excel in fighting, and are allied with the Bulqarn and Shamran.430 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST Their chief menace comes from the Ghamid, and the Khath'am Bulqarn, Beni 'Amr, and Shamran all unite against that powerfui tribe when it threatens any one of them.

Bm The Beni Malik live to the north of Ibha, their southern boundary being only 2 miles away. The adjoining tribes are: on the north the Balahmar, east the Shahran, south the Beni Mugheid, and west the 'Alqam el-Hul and Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah. They are of Qahtan stock, and with the Beni Mugheid, Rufeidat el-Yemen, and 'Alqam el-Hul form what is, strictly speaking, Asir. The tribe numbers about 5,000 men, of whom 2,000 are nomads. The villagers are under Sheikh 'Ali ibn Ma'addi, and are divided into the three chief clans of Al el-Mujemmil, Beni Rizam, and Beni Rabi'ah. They are Turkish in sympathy with the exception of the Beni Rizam, whose Sheikh, Tahir Abu Hashar, was imprisoned for a year at Ibha for attempting a revolt. They all pay taxes, and are peaceful and unwarlike people, looked down on by all the neighbouring tribes, who have named them in derision 'Jauba' or donkeys. The nomads are good fighters, and pay only a nominal allegiance to the Turks. They come into the villages during the harvest, and for the rest of the year wander to the east round Jinfur, an isolated village of theirs in the Shahran country, or go down to the 'Alqam el-Hul or Rabl'ah wa Rufeidah. They are at enmity with the Beni Tha'labah section of the Balahmar. The country is fertile, and largely supplies Ibha with fruits. 'Ali ibn Ma'addi, the chief Sheikh, is an old man of 60, and is a member of the Ibha town council. He is reported to be mean and avaricious. . . Sa'd ibn Dhuh, the chief of the nomads, is a brave old warrior ot over 70, and is anti-Turk. He is supported by his seven sons.432 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST (b) Nomads. 2,000 men.

Beni Mar wan A Sunni tribe numbering about 1,000 fighting men and inhabit ing the country from Wadi Heir an on the south almost to Wadi Ta'ashar on the north. They are bounded on the north by the Masarihah, on the east by the Ahl Haradh and Khamisin, and on the south by the Beni Hasan. The port of Midi is in their country, and their chief village is Suq el-Keiran. Formerly they were partisans of the Idrisi, but they rebelled against him when he accepted help from the Italians. They are evidently still dis loyal, for the Idrisi is reported to have sent a punitive expedition against Ibn Bakri, their chief Sheikh, in November 1915. Sheikh Tahir 'Ali is the Sheikh of Midi. 25. M A Sunni tribe supporting the Idrisi, who occupy the country from Wadi Ta'ashar almost up to Abu 'Arish and Jeizan on the north and east to the first foot-hills. They are bounded on the north by the Reish, on the south by the Ja'dah and Beni Marwan, and on the east by the Beni Mohammed. Their chief village is Samtah, and they are said to muster 1,000 fighting men. The chief Sheikhs are Ahmed Masawah, 'Othman Siwadi, Abu Halim, and Yahya Mihah. 26. Beni A tribe east of the Masarihah in the hills south -east of Jeizan. They support the Idrisi. 27. Beni The Beni Mugheid are a fine fighting tribe dwelling in the steep hill country which leads up to Ibha from the south and in an around Ibha itself. The adjoining tribes are: on the north e 'Alqam el-Hul and Beni Malik, on the east the Shahran, on tneASIR V 433 south the Sha'af Rashah and Al Yinfa'ah sections of the Shahran and the Rabi'at el-Yemen, and on the west the Rijal el-M'a. Their southern limit is the Wadi Shahlah, which flows into the Wadi Dhilah (or Dhil'a) at Heidat et-Tihamiyah. The tribe numbers about 7,000 men, of whom more than 5,000 are firm adherents of the Turks, and as their fortresses are practically impregnable in Arab warfare, they are a valuable asset to the Ottoman Government. _ The tribe is divided into seven divisions, the Al Yazld, Al Najih, Al el-Wazi, Al Umm Sheraf, Al Umm Jerei'at, Al Umm Wadi Malah, and Al Weiman. Their country is fertile, with running streams, and produces coffee and fruits. The Al Yazid are the ruling clan and are subdivided into the families of Ibn Mufarrih, Al Abu Sarah, and Aulad el-Emir Moham med ibn 'A'idh, who ruled supreme over all Asir before the days of the Turks and the Idrisi. The Idrisi's rise to power has split up many a tribe in Asir which was formerly united, and the Al Yazid have not escaped the general feeling of discord. The head of the Aulad el-Emir Mohammed ibn 'Aidh is Hasan ibn 'Ali, a young man of 26, who has already dis tinguished himself in battle. He was at one time with the Idrisi, but in 1910 was bribed by the Sherif of Mecca and seceded to the Turks, who made him Vali of Asir, which strictly speaking only includes the tribes of Beni Malik, 'Alqam, Rufeidat el-Yemen, and Beni Mugheid, who are all descended from Qahtan, but is used loosely to include all the tribes from Wada'ah to Zahran. In practice he only rules those tribes who recognize Turkish authority. The Turks, as is their custom with local chiefs whom they wish to keep in good humour, have made him a Bey. His own house is divided against him, for while his cousins Nasir and Mohammed ibn Abd er-Rahman support him and occupy positions under the Turks, the rest of his family, including his brother 'Ali, a young man of 20, have Idrisi sympathies and refuse to countenance the Government. The family lives at Reidah and Harmalah, about 15 miles to the south-west of Ibha, Hasan ibn 'Ali himself occupying the strong fortress of Qasr 'Ali ibn Mohammed. The Aulad ibn Mufarrih live at Sijah, three miles north of Reidah, and are descendants of Sheikh Mufarrih, who ruled over Asir until he was ousted by the house of A'idh. On this account there has always been ill-feeling between the two families, which has developed into open hatred in the present generation owing to the murder of Ahmed ibn Mufarrih, father of 'Abdullah ibn Mufarrih, by the father ot Hasan ibn 'Ali some years ago. The Aulad ibn Mufarrih rebelled against the Turks when the ARABIA I E ^434 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST Idrlsi arose, and under 'Abdullah ibn Mughethil defeated a force sent against them. 'Abdullah ibn Mufarrih is their chief, a man of 45, who holds the title of Bey from the Turks, and on account of his large estate and his landed property in Ibha is outwardly on good terms with them, but secretly in communication with the Idrisi. Of the Al Abu Sarah, whose head-quarters are at Dhohyah, just to the north of Sijah, 'Ali ibn Lahiq and his son Husein were for merly with the Turks, but have seceded and allied themselves with the Aulad ibn Mufarrih. Mohammed Abu Dusah has long been a noted opponent of the Turks. The Al Najih are just to the west of Ibha and are divided in their sympathy. Their Sheikh, Yahya ibn Salim, was taken captive and imprisoned by the Idrisi five years ago for refusing to pay taxes to him._ The Al el-Wazi live near the 'Alqam el-Hul boundary, and are especially noted for their bravery, which has earned their nickname of Turk el-'Arab. They are all pro-Turk. The Al TT mm Sheraf are all settled along the Al Sirhan (Shahran) boundary and are entirely out of hand, being at open enmity with the Turks and all their neighbours, as well as their own tribe. Their country is the focus of all the thieves and highwaymen of the dis trict, and they continually hold up the roads and rob innocent travellers. They also go up to the Wadi Tayyah in the Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah district, and help the Al Harith in their war against society. The most notorious amongst them are 'Abdullah ibn Mifdhil,_ Nasir and Musa ibn Sherein, and Gharam ibn Rabih. The Al Umm Jerei'at and Al Umm Wadi Malah are both settled in and round Ibha, and are with the Government. The Al Weiman, a small section of 400 men who live near the Rabi'ah border to the south, are under the influence of the Idrisi. The Beni Mugheid are not a quarrelsome race and live at peace with all their neighbours, except the Rijal el-M'a, with whom they have a hereditary feud, They take a considerable part in the local government, occupying many of the smaller posts, such as clerk ships and the like, and a few have been chosen to represent Asir in the Ottoman Parliament. Amongst these are Ahmed ibn Umin Shibah of the Al Umm Mufarrih, a man of 60, fat, dark, and oi average height. He is an eloquent speaker, a keen politician, an very pro-Turk with a strong hatred of the Sa'dah. When at lb a he sits on the ' Mejlis BelediHe is a rich landowner, bu is unpopular on account of his meanness. i ii tt m 'Ali ibn Khanfur is another deputy, and belongs to the Al m Wadi Malah. He belongs to a middle-class family, his people e gASIR 435 traders in hides in a small way. He used to be Bashkatib of accounts in Ibha, having worked his way up from a small clerkship. He is a small man of about 40; his face is pitted with small-pox. He is very intelligent, and used to be religious, but has latterly taken to drink. He is not liked by the tribe, Mohammed ibn 'Aziz, of the Al Umm Manadhir, is another man of importance. He married a sister of Husein Eff, weled Muzeiqah Julas, a deputy for Asir and the Finance Minister (Sanduq Amini), and is accustomed to act for the latter during his absence abroad. He is also responsible for assessing the taxes in all the Turkish districts. A man of 25 years of age, small and dark, he is clever and has a good reputation. His brother, Mansur ibn 'Aziz, was sent to Constantinople three years ago to represent certain grievances of the people of Ibha, and succeeded in securing the dismissal of several Turkish officials, Mohammed ibn Musallat, who is Sheikh of the Al Umm Wadi Malah, is also president of the town council, or Mejlis Beledi, at Ibha, A man of 30 years of age; he is not liked by the tribe, but is capable and has a fine fighting record.

Munjahah The Munjahah occupy the sea-coast and a few miles inland from just south of Birk almost to Shuqaiq, and are bounded on the north by the Beni Hilal, east by the Rijal el-M'a and south by the tribes of Mikhlaf el-Yemen. They muster about 6,000 men, of whom five-sixths are nomads. The villagers live in the small ports of Wasm, Wahlah, and Khasa'ah. They have a little cultivation, a few date-trees, and eke out their existence by acting as porters in their own villages and at Birk. These places, though small, are important as being the chief inlets for arms and ammunition, a trade which is chiefly in the hands of the Rijal el-M'a. The Idrisi stations his port' officers at them, but the Rijal el-M'a, who treat with him as equals rather than subjects, refuse to recognize his right to tax them, and he does not press the point. The Munjahah, however, all pay him taxes, Sheikh Hasan Easikh being deputed to collect them. The nomads are fairly well off in sheep and camels. They are fishermen and sell dried fish in the interior. They also export nuts to Musawwa'. Their reputation is very evil and even their guests sleep with their rifles by their sides. Their solemn oath has no meaning for them and they are notorious for their treachery. Before the Idrisi reduced them to order they were slave-dealers and kidnappers, highwaymen and sea-pirates, and used to raid right up to Muha'il and Barak. They do not dare now to commit more than an occasional robbery or murder, for the Idrisi's police are always stationed in their country and punish severely any attempt to return to the old way of living. They are disliked by all the surrounding tribes, but in ordinary times they wander out of their country to the Bahr ibn Sekeinah and Beni Hilal. They do not go south of Shuqaiq at all, having no wish to come into closer contact with the Idrisi than is necessary. Their chief Sheikh, 'Ali ibn Eayy, is a man of 46 years of age, and helps the Idrisi to maintain law and order. His house is in Wasm, where he owns considerable property. He has seen much fighting and always leads his tribe in battle. Chief Sheikh : 'Ali ibn Eayy. 6,000 men. (a)Settled. 1,000 men. Chief villages :— Qahmah 'A'idh ibn 'Isa.

AlMusa The Al Musa own the town of Muha'il and the country round within a radius of from 5 to 10 miles. They are mostly settled, but the clans of Umm Jirban and Beni Yazid are nomad. The tribe a mixed one, the nomads and a few of the townsmen being of pure Arab blood, the rest being blacks, originally of some African strain. No doubt they were at one time slaves, but they have long since earned their emancipation by their courage, and are now on an equality with the Arab portion of the tribe, although no inter marriage takes place. The tribe is fairly rich in flocks and herds, and although their country, which stands comparatively low, cannot rival the fertility of the highlands, it nevertheless produces good crops in the rainy seasons. The enmity between the Turks and Idrisi has disorganized the tribe, and divided it into two opposing factions Sheikh Suleiman ibn 'Ali, who is by right of inheritance the paramount chief, has thrown in his lot with the Turks, and has behind him the Umm Jirban and about half the villagers. The remainder have broken loose under the leadership of Dhakir ibn Sha'r, and many of them have retired to live at Jannah in the Bahr ibn Sekeinah country, refusing to live at Muha'il so long as there is a Turkish post there. From Jannah they carry on a guerrilla warfare, closing the roads and cutting off Turkish convoys whenever they can. The tribe is bounded on the north by the Al ed-Dureib and Reish, on the east by the Reish and Beni Thuwwah, on the south by the Beni Thuwwah and Bahr ibn Sekeinah, and on the west by the Beni Hilal. Against the Beni Hilal and Beni Thuwwah the whole tribe has had a feud for many generations. Their other neighbours,ASIR 441 30. Nafu The Naj'u are an entirely nomadic tribe, numbering about 6,000 men, inhabiting the portion of the district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen between Sabia and Darb. They possess small herds of camels and goats, but, although numerous, are of little political importance, since they are poor fighters and there is little cohesion amongst their clans. They earn their living chiefly by selling milk and in Sabia. Sheikh Mohammed ibn Musa'i is their chief. The tribe pays taxes regularly to the Idrisi. Chief subdivisions are the Beni Mohammed (not connected with the Beni Mohammed farther south), the Hajawi or Haju, and Beni Mufarrih. 31. BeniNash A small tribe in the mountains east of the Wa'zat and to the south of the Beni Aslam. Their chief village is Suq Beni Nashar, where a market is held every Wednesday. They do not number more than 1,000 souls, but afford what help they can to the Beni 'Abs and Idrisi against the Wa'zat. Sheikh Yahya Saghir is the principal Sheikh, others being 'Ali el-Qahm (who was originally with Ibn el-Heij of the Wa'zat, but submitted to the Idrisi two years ago), and Ahmed Janah. 32. Qa The Qahtan of Asir are the Rufeidat el-Yemen, Beni Bishr, Senhan el-Hibab, 'Abidah, Wada'ah, and Shereif. They are known in Asir generically as the Qahtan, and Sheikh Mohammed ibn Dhuleim of the Shereif is Emir over them all by appointment of the Idrisi, as was his father by appointment of the Turks, but they are in fact six separate tribes, each living within its own boundaries, having its own particular ambitions, its special likes and dislikes, its peculiar customs, and forming by itself a completely independent unit. Part of the Rufeidat el-Yemen are under Turkish influence. It is only in times of great crisis, as when the Shahran rose in a body against them about a hundred years ago, that they answer to the call of their common blood, or nowadays when the Idrisi calls on them to rally to his standard under their tribal leader. In normal times some are at enmity with others, and although Sheikh Mohammed ibn Dhuleim may be called in to settle tribal disputes and is responsible to the Idrisi for their good order, he has nothing to do with their tribal administration. They are in fact a loose confederation, who will only combine for defence in face of a danger442 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST which threatens to extinguish all, and for offence at the biddiiw of the Idrisi, g On this account they are dealt with one by one, but are grouped together under the heading of Qahtan for convenience of reference They are far too removed from the northern Qahtan to keep in touch with them, and never go near their country. Sometimes in times of drought a few of the former come down south and are always well received, but the connexion ends at that. The southern Qahtan tribes are for the most part, and with the exception of certain nomad sub-tribes, well conducted and pros perous, and interested in trade or agriculture. The different sections vary considerably in military skill and few of them appear to have inherited the characteristics which have earned for their northern relations such an unsavoury reputation. 33. The 'Abidah appear to be the bravest as well as the most pros perous and enterprising section of the Qahtan. Their boundary in the south, where they have their villages, is well defined, but to the north their nomads wander over a vast stretch of country, and for almost 150 miles their western boundary adjoins that of the Shahran. To the east lies Tathlith and the Yam tribes, to the south the Beni Bishr, and to the south-west the Rufeidat el-Yemen. The 'Abidah will follow Mohammed ibn Dhuleim in battle, but they do not like the Shereif in normal times, and look to their own chief Sheikh, Sa'd ibn Suleim, in tribal matters. The latter is a man of about 40, and lives at Khamis Abidah, the principal village and market-place of the tribe. He is a rich man, and owns a large estate, and is much liked by his tribesmen, both for his justice and fairness and because he always is in the forefront of every fight. His sister married one of the sons of 'Abd el-Aziz Musheit, chief of the Shahran, about 20 years ago, and a truce was made between the two tribes. Shortly afterwards he had the misfortune to kill another of 'Abd el-'Aziz's sons in a petty tribal dispute, and war again broke out and continued until the Idrisi pacified the country. There is still a bitter hatred between the two, which shows itself in periodical outbreaks. So deep is the enmity that in the case of a murder of an 'Abidah by a Shahran no question of blood money is entertained, and the murdered mans relations do not rest until they have killed a Shahran in return. Sheikh Sa'd ibn Suleim was formerly with the Turks, but he joined the Idrisi in his first revolt and has been one of his most faithfulASIR 443 i# 1 followers ever since. The Idrisi has a representative at Khamis 'Abidah, who collects taxes from all the tribe. The 'Abidah engage largely in trading, and buy up much of the ! coffee which comes from the district round Jebel Razah through f Wada', subsequently selling it throughout Asir. Some of them live • permanently in Rijal, Ibha, and Namas, and others are engaged ' in the Jiddah trade. They are a very industrious race, always on the look-out for making money, and their villages are numerous J and well built. They also specialize as masons and ply their trade ■ throughout Asir. They do not agree with the Shereif or Beni Bishr • in peace time, but are friendly with the Rufeidat el-Yemen and f Senhan el-Hibab. Unlike a great many tribes, the 'Abidah are entirely united and the nomads are guided in their policy by the villagers. They are rich in dark-haired camels and black sheep, and take great pride in their pedigree horses. They will sell their poorer animals in the market, but they take great care of their finer beasts, feeding them on milk and only parting with them on special occasions, such as when they make a present to the Idrisi. The Al Hamdan and Hurjan, who number about 3,000 men and 2,000 men respectively, are the two largest sections of the nomads. They come down to Khamis 'Abidah for the harvest and afterwards go up to BIshah with the other nomads for the date season. They also wander out to Tathlith, where they meet other Qahtan Arabs and those of the Yam tribes, and where are to be found succulent grasses on which to fatten their herds. Their country abounds in gum, which they collect and sell in Khamis 'Abidah. In war they fight on camel-'or horse-back, and carry rifles, lances, and long curved jendbih. For a long time the Al Rusheid and Al Ghamar of the Shahran used to pay them money in order to escape being raided, but Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz ibn Musheit refused to countenance this. They are always at odds with the northern nomads of the Shahran, and sometimes cut across and raid the Bishah-Ibha road round Bir Umm Sarar. The 'Abidah do not seem to have inherited the bad qualities of the northern Qahtan.

BeBishr The Beni Bishr stretch from the down country of the central plateau to the mountainous slopes leading down to the district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen, their nearest point to Sabia being about 30 miles away. Their country is barren in the east, but productive and well forested near the sea. The adjoining tribes are the 'Abidah on the north, Yam, Shereif, and Senhan el-Hibab on the east, Beni Jum'ah on the south, and the Naj'u and Rufeidat el Yemen on the west. The tribe numbers about 1,000 settled men and 3,000 nomads. 'Abd el-Hadi is the chief Sheikh, but his influence over the nomads is only nominal. He deserted the Turks some years ago, and all the tribes pay taxes to the Idrisi now. The settled portion is hos pitable and prosperous; the nomads wild and intractable, almost without religion and with no marriage laws. They roam chiefly about the Tihamah and are rich in a breed of large black sheep. The tribe is friendly with the 'Abidah and Rufeidat el Yemen, and generally at odds with the Naj'u, Senhan, and Yam.

Bufeidat el-Y The Rufeidat el-Yemen is a large tribe, numbering some 15,000 men, to the south-east of Ibha, extending up the main mountain ridge and on to the plateau to beyond the source of the Wadi Shahran. The tribe is divided into four main divisions, the Al el-Jihal, Bishat Ibn Salim, Beni Qeis, and Sha'af Yarimah wa Khutab. The chief Sheikh over all the tribe is Husein ibn Heif, a man of 40, who lives at Mudhiq, where he is a large and prosperous land owner. His father was a mudir under the Turks, and died in the Ghamid country fighting for them, but Husein ibn Heif joined the Idrisi when he first revolted, and fought for him in 1910. His tribe shares his dislike of the Turks and respects and obeys him. The Al el-Jihal have for generations been separated from the rest of the tribe, and live a few miles to the west with the Sha'af Rashhah and Al Sirhan sections of the Shahran. They have not, however, intermarried with the latter, and are obedient to Husein ibn Heif, although they do not join in any of the quarrels which constantly occur between their own tribe and their hereditary enemies the Shahran. They are strongly in favour of the Idrisi and have fought for him on several occasions. The chief of the Bishat ibn Salim is Mohammed ibn 'Ali Weled 'Ali ibn Mura'i, a shifty and cowardly man of about 45, who sup ports the Turks and is paid by them. This section pays taxes to the Government. The Beni Qeis lie to the east of the Bishat Ibn Salim, and also pay taxes to the Turks. Their Sheikh, Abu Salam, is now an old man of 75 and deaf. He has always had the reputation of siding with the strongest party. The nomad portion of this section, the A Shuwat„ are inde pendent of him and the Turks.446 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST The Sha'af Yarlmah wa Khutab who live to the south are likewise free, and the allegiance which they pay to the Idrisi is only nominal They are a wild and suspicious people, and though they have no objection to entertaining guests, they will not suffer them to sWr, in their tents. ^ The country of the Rufeidat el-Yemen is for the most part fertile and densely wooded on the slopes of the hills, and the tribe is a prosperous one. They are not noted for their martial ardour though the A1 el-Jihal and the nomads can fight well. They are nicknamed by the other tribes the 'Muhaniyatein el-Murrah', owing to their habit of staining their women with henna. All that portion of the tribe which is against the Turks recognize the overlordship of Sheikh Mohammed ibn Dhuleim of the Shereif, The sister of Husein ibn Heif is married to Sheikh Mohammed, and the two chiefs are close friends.

The vil lagers pay taxes to the Idrisi, but the nomads will not do more than help him in war. Their friends are the 'Abidah and Beni Bishr • their foes the Shereif, Wada'ah, and Yam. When the Idrisi calls on them to fight they unite under Mohammed ibn Dhuleim of the Shereif, but in normal times they pay him only a nominal allegiance Chief Sheikh : Eerdan ibn Dhuleim. 4,000 men.

The Shereif inhabit the down country to the west of the Yam tribes, and are bounded on the north by the Beni Bishr and Yam, on the east by the Yam, on the south by the Senhan el-Hibab, and on the west by the Beni Bishr. Their country is flat and treeless, and most of their cultivation is from well water. They are traders rather than agriculturists, and are well conducted and unwarlike. Their number does not exceed 800 men, of whom a quarter are nomads. They are chiefly known on account of their leader, Sheikh Mohammed ibn Dhuleim, His father, Dhuleim ibn Sha'r, who died about 16 years ago, was a famous man in Asir, and for many years was the Mudir of all Qahtan tribes. His head-quarters were at Harajah, in Shereif, where there was also a Turkish garrison. Mohammed ibn Dhuleim succeeded him at a monthly salary of £25, but seceded to the Idrisi when the latter raised his standard of revolt. The Turks thereupon sent an expedition against him and burnt his fortress in Harajah, but were ultimately forced to retire and have not penetrated to his country since. The Idrisi made him one of his Muqdamis or generals, and he was in command of the Qahtan tribes in the fightingASIR 449 ^ against the Turks and the Sherif of Mecca in 1910. Afterwards he 1 and Seyyid 'Arar ibn Nasir led the Idrisi's army against the Imam's p forces under Mohammed Abu Nuweibah, in the Sahar country, ® about three years ago. He is still a young man about 35 years of J'-' age, rich according to the standards of the country, and with an h excellent reputation both as a leader in war and a tribal adminis trator.

W The Wada'ah are a small mercantile tribe numbering about 600 [tbi men, living in the district of the same name near the Yam tribes mill of Nejran. They are bounded on the north and east by the Yam Mi and on the west by the Senhan el-Hibab. Their country is not naturally productive, but they have a large number of wells and alfcl grow grapes which they convert into raisins and sell as far as itiic Ibha and Rijal. They also import coffee from Jebel Razah and ■Jgi Khaulan esh-Sham, and sell it in Asir or to the merchants of the ([{I ' Rufeidat el-Yemen. They are generally on bad terms with the ijH Yam tribes, but are not a quarrelsome or pugnacious tribe. The Idrisi has his police and tax-gatherers amongst them, as he has ^r, amongst the other Qahtan tribes.

The Barak-Qunfudah road runs through the middle of their territory for about 20 miles between the villages of Gliai el-Hindi and Juma'ah Rabi'ah. They are bounded on the nortli by the Beni Shihir, on the east by the Humeidah, on the south by the Rabi'at et-Tahahin, and on the west by the Bela'ir. Thev are said to be fairer of face than most Arabs, with blue eyes, and to wear their hair well down over the shoulders. They are almost pagan, and at odds with all the world except the Rabi'at et-Tahabin who are as savage as themselves. The Idrisi sometimes succeeds in levying taxes on them, but his influence is only nominal. Passage through their country is dangerous both to the Turks and ordinary wayfarers. They are rich in camels and cattle. A small clan of the A1 Ikhleif section of the A1 ed-Dureib lives in the north-east corner of their territory with their consent. 40. RabVatet-TahaMn The Rabi'at et-Tahahin hold the country on either side of the Sikkat el-Helawiyah (Muha'il-Qunfudah road) between the villages of Ma'mal A1 Ikhleif and Markh, a distance of about 30 miles. They are bounded on the west by the Bela'ir, on the north by the Bela'ir, Rabi'ah Mujatirah, and Humeidah, on the east by the A1 Jebali and A1 ed-Dureib, and on the south by the Beni Hilal and the Hali tribes. Their country is mountainous and well wooded, and they are rich in camels, goats, and cattle. About 2,000 in number of fighting men, they are entirely nomad, despise all forms of husbandry, and are a terror to travellers on the road. They are allied with the Rabi'ah Mujatirah and A1 ed-Dureib, and generally on fair terms with the Hali tribes. With the Beni Hilal, Bela'ir, Humeidah, and A1 Jebali they keep up incessant feuds, The Turks have never been able to do anything with them, but the Idrisi is able to tax them to a certain extent, and what outside sympathies they have are for him. 41. Rabi'ah wa The Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah stretch from a few miles NNW. of Ibha to within about 15 miles of Muha'il, their country being about 35 miles from north to south, and 20 miles from east to west on the average, though it tapers to a point in the north.

P f 2 ASIE 451 which adjoin them are ; on the north the Reish, on the east the Balahmar and Beni Malik, on the south the Alqam el-Hul, and on the west the Rijal el-M'a and Beni Thuwwah. The tribe is divided into four main divisions, the Rabi'at esh-Sham, A1 Asimah, Rufeidat esh-Sham, and Al Harith. The Rabi'at esh- Sham and Rufeidat esh-Sham have no relationship or connexion with the Rabi'at el-Yemen and Rufeidat el-Yemen, as might be supposed. The Rabi'at esh-Sham occupy the southern portion of the terri tory, being entirely settled in villages along the Ibha—Athalif road. _ They have no Chief Sheikh, having expelled 'A'idh ibn Hasan, their former Sheikh, on account of his desertion to the Turks. The Al 'Asimah are partly settled and partly nomad, chiefly along the Beni Thuwwah boundary. Their Chief Sheikh, 'Ali ibn Hamud, fought for the Idrisi in 1910, was captured by the Turks, and after a year's imprisonment was released and reinstated. The Al Harith, who are both settled and nomad, live in the Wadi Tayyah, along which is the main road from Ibha to Muha'il, and for years have given a great deal of trouble to the Govern ment. The Wadi Tayyah is the head-quarters of all the bad characters in the neighbouring country, and a caravan has to be very strong to pass through without paying toll. The Al Harith are notoriously treacherous, and their hand is against the whole world, including their own tribe. They engage in the camel- carrying trade to a certain extent between Muha'il and the Rijal el-M'a, but they seldom venture near Ibha, nor can the Turks levy taxes from them, as they sometimes do from the rest of the tribe. Their Sheikh, Mohammed ibn Shahir, has a very bad repu tation. The tribe as a whole favours the Idrisi, chiefly because it is dis contented with the Government. It is, however, notoriously fickle and unreliable, and goes with the side which pays it best. It maintains a hereditary feud with the Rijal el-M'a. It is descended from Qahtan.ASIR 463 Umm Muqza'ah A'farah. Lasafah. Lahiq ez-Zeidani, (ii) Nomad. Chief clans :— 11 Dhi'b Ahmed ibn Dhatir. Hidha'ah. Mughra'ah. Al Nahyah A1 'Aqabah 42. Rabl l at The Rabi'at el-Yemen are a nomadic tribe keeping chiefly to Wadi Dhil'a (Dhulah) and Wadi Shahlah, and sometimes going down to Shuqaiq or up to the Beni Mugheid country. The adjoining tribes are the Beni Mugheid on the north and north-east, the Shahran on the south-east, the Beni Shi'bah and other nomads of Mikhlaf el-Yemen on the south, and the Rijal el-M'a on the west. They are rich in camels, donkeys, and flocks, and make a good living by selling semn in Ibha. They are well armed with the type of French rifle which they call ' Abu Bukrah', and carry shields, as well as long curved knives {jendb They are noted for their bravery and deem it a disgrace to die in their beds. Though wild and rough and with such a contempt for marriage that as a rule they have to be known by the names of their mothers, they are nevertheless hospitable, and clean in their fighting, and have the reputation of never going back on their word once given. In person they are very tall and fairer than most Arabs, with blue eyes. They say they are descended from the Ashraf el-Huseiniyah, but their enemies name the Sulubba, or wandering gipsy tinkers, as their forefathers. They pay but little attention to religion, and on the first day of Ramadan choose thirty young men, whom they dress in white and compel to fast for one day at some ap pointed place, on behalf of the whole tribe. Having done this they have a feast, and taunt the neighbouring nomads for their inabihty to rise to such heights of self-sacrifice They are a united and conservative tribe, condemning those who smoke, and in their contempt for foreign luxuries eating only milk and meat. They live in straw-plaited tents. Their friends are the Beni Mugheid: their enemies, the Rijal el-M'a, Shahran, Beni Shi'bah, and Naj'u. The Turks have never been able to keep them in order, and their attitude to the Idrisi depends entirely on his power to make them obey, 'Ali ibn Jabbar is their chief Sheikh, a man of 45 and a noted warrior.

Their southern boundary comes to within 5 miles of Muha'il. They are divided into two sections of Reish and Al Meshwal. and number about 2,500 men. But although fairly numerous, they are cowardly and unwarlike, and are classed in contempt with the Beni Malik by the fighting tribes round. They all favour the Idrisi and pay him taxes. They tried to make a stand in 1912 against the Sherif of Mecca, but were badly worsted and their country laid waste. They are entirely sedentary and engaged in farming. The country is fairly level, thickly wooded and pro ductive, with running streams in places. Their enemies are Balas mar, _Beni Shihir, and Balahmar; their allies, the Barak tribes, the Al Musa, Beni Thuwwah, and the Beni Qutabah and Beni Dhalim of the Rijal el-M'a.

Rijdl el-M'a The Rijal el-M'a, though not so numerous as some of the Asir tribes—it can at most put 17,000 men in the field—is nevertheless one of the most renowned for its courage and dash in war, its internal unity, and its pride of independence. Its country lies between Ibha and the sea, and is roughly a stretch of 50 miles from NW. to SE., and 25 miles from NE. to SW. Its neighbours are the Bahr ibn Sekeinah and Beni Thuwwah on the north, Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah, 'Alqam, Beni Mugheid and Rabi'at el- Yemen on the east, Beni Shi'bah on the south, and Munjahah and Beni Hilal on the west. The tribe is divided into seven subdivisions : the Beni Qutabah, Beni Dhalim, Beni Junah, Jeis ibn Mas'udi, Beni Zeidin, Shahab, and Umm Bina. The chief Sheikh of the whole tribe is Ibrahim ibn Muta'ali of J ulla, a man much respected for his prowess in war and his wisdom in tribal matters. He is now over 70 years of age, and for some time most of the administration has devolved on his son, Ahmed ibn Muta'ali. The latter is a tall man of about 30, with a fair skin, who first made his name as a fighter when the Rijal el-M'a overran Mikhlaf el-Yemen just before the rise of the Idrisi. He fought the Sherif in 1910 at Muha'il and in the Balahmar country, but with drew his forces at a critical moment owing to the appointment of Seyyid Mustafa, of the Bahr ibn Sekeinah, as general of the whole Asir army. So greatly did the Rijal el-M'a resent having an456 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST outsider placed over them, that soon after one of thpir mi.. Sheikhs Seyyid Yahya walad Esh-Sheiri, with the full approval of the tnbe attempted to murder him. The Idrisi gave way on the matter, but the mischief had been done, and the Riial el-M'! took no further part in the campaign. sub-tribes, the Beni Qutabah live in the fertUe vallev of Wadi Us, which nses near Suda, and joining the Wai Ahabesh near Athahf, eventually flows into the Wadi Dhofa' bv a u -f-i 1- - Tlie ■ Beni Qutabah stretch from near its source to beyond Athahf in a succession of villages surrounded by cultivation. The slopes of the hills and the valleys, except where cleared, are here as elsewhere in the Rijal el-M'a country, deeply forested. The Bern Qutabah, though dwelling in villages, are of a wandering temperament, and are the chief camel carriers on all the trade routes of Asir, going to Sabia, Qunfudah, Birk, and sometimes as far as Bishah and Mecca. There is a small colony of 'Abadilah Ashraf who live with them and wield a certain amount of influence. The Sheikh of Athalif, Ibrahim el-Hufdhi, is a man of some notoriety. His father was made a Kaimmakam by the Turks and granted a pension of £15 a month, which was paid to his family until the tribe revolted. Ibrahim el-Hufdhi went to Constantinople in 1914 to assert his loyalty to the Turks and ask that the pension should continue to be paid to him. His influence in the tribe is not great. The Beni Dhalim lie to the south of the Wadi 'Us and are entirely settled. They are the largest section, numbering 4,000 men, and also by far the richest. They have most of the trade of Asir in their hands and bring petroleum, sugar, tea, clothing, &amp;c., from Aden and Musawwa', which they sell chiefly in the large village of Rijal. They have been the foremost pioneers in the importation of fire-arms from Jibuti, which has increased so largely during the last few years and which the Turks have found it im possible to check. Eijal is the focus of all local products and skins; gum semn are brought from as far as the Shahran country, bought by the Beni Dhalim merchants, and exported to Aden. The village next in importance is Sha^bein, the chief rifle market. The Rijal el-M'a never marry outside their own country, but as they have grown rich they have bought much land in the neighbour ing districts of 'Alqam el-Hul and Rabl'at el-Yemen. Amongst the most wealthy of them is a family of Seyyids, known as the Sa'dat en-TSa amiyah, who have lived amongst them for many generations, and whose head, Seyyid Husein en-Na'ami, is the most important leader in war after Ahmed el-Muta'ali and Ahmed el-Hayyani.ASIR 457 The Beni Junah are partly settled in villages and partly nomad, and inhabit the country towards the Munjahah. They, too, engage in trade to a certain extent, and one of their Sheikhs, Ayuh, was the first man to start the gun-running venture. The village of Jabut was the chief centre, and received its name from Jibuti. They are also occupied with home industries, and both men and women are employed in making straw-woven articles, such as matting, baskets, and hats, which they call and which are largely worn by the women of A sir. The most important man of the Beni Dhalim and one of the best known in Asir is Zein el-'Abidin, chief Mufti of Asir, and greatly trusted by the Idrisi. Educated at Zebid, he had already become a force in Asir before the rise of the Idrisi, by reason of his learning and the justice of his decisions. He has now powers of life and death, and is the chief judge of appeals from the judgements of the tribal Qadhis and Muftis wherever the power of the Idrisi runs. He is also frequently called in to arbitrate in the more important tribal disputes, and as the Rijal el-M'a have implicit confidence in him and are willing to back it by force of arms, his influence is very great. He is now a man of about 40 years of age, and has houses in Sabia and Rijal. The Jeis ibn Mas'udi live near the 'Alqam el-Hul border and are the aristocrats of the tribe. The paramount family belongs to them, and they consider it beneath their dignity to engage in trade of any sort. They live for fighting alone, and have as high a repu tation for courage as any tribe in the country. Their integrity, too, is unchallenged, and in most of the tribal disputes in neigh bouring friendly tribes they are called in to arbitrate. In the south are the Beni Zeidin along the Beni Mugheid and Beni Shi'bah boundaries. They, too, are noted fighters. They grow much coffee on the slopes of the hills and their nomad clans are rich in flocks. Their chief Sheikh is Ahmed el-Hayyani, who lives at Hiswah. He is a man of about 45 and, after Ahmed ibn Muta'ali, he is the most important man in the tribe. An enemy of the Turks since childhood, he eagerly supported the Idrisi, and is said to have almost as much influence with him as Mohammed Yahya Ba Sahi. He is a great friend of Seyyid Mustafa, and keeps on good, though at times jealous, terms with Ahmed ibn Muta ali. The Shahab and Umm Bina share the country in the Wadi Ahabesh to the north. They are entirely agricultural and pastoral, and seldom leave their borders except to fight.458 SETTLED TRIBES OP THE WEST The Rijal el-M'a are foes with the Beni Hilal, Beni MushpiH Rabxah wa Rufeidah, A1 Musa, and Munjahah. With the TW Thuwwah, 'Alqam, and Beni Shi'bah they are allies Thev W p ! once good friends of the Bahr Ibn Sekeinah, but relations hav been strained since the Seyyid Mustafa episode. Before the Idrisi arose they were under the domination of the Turks, but since Ms revolt they have entirely thrown off their yoke. During the last few years the road to Muha'il from Ibha, Athalif, has been closed to the Turks, and frequent dashes are made to the main Muha il-Ibha road when news is received that a Turkish convov is passing through. They support the Idrisi as equals, rather than as subjects, and will neither consent to pay him taxes nor suffer his officers to rule them. They have a code of justice amongst themselves which is fairly rough and ready, but is rigidly enforced. Murder is severely punished, sometimes by death, sometimes by the payment of blood-money ; theft, after two warnings and when proved by witnesses on oath, by the loss of a hand. There is a fixed dowry, both for rich and poor, of P 120, and plurality of wives is the excep tion. There is a strong feeling against divorce without adequate reason. A man is considered justified in taking a second wife if the first fails to bear him children, but such a failure is not a suffi cient excuse for a divorce.

AhlSabia The term Ahl Sabia is vaguely used in Asir to include the people of Sabia itself and the villages round within a considerable radius. They are in no sense a tribe, and should therefore properly be excluded from this handbook, but as mention of them is sometimes made in reports, and they are closely connected with the Idrisi, whose head-quarters are at Sabia, a brief description is included. Before the Idrisi's rise to power these villages were a succession of small independent units, each a law to itself and generally at odds with its neighbour. The Turks never attempted a proper adminis tration of the country, and violence was rife to such a degree that only large armed parties could travel with safety. Only when the hillmen descended on them was there any degree of cohesion, and in the last attack of the Rijal el-M'a, which took place about thirteen years ago, the villagers all combined to save their homes. The first task of the Idrisi was to conciliate the different warring elements and to promote peace, and to-day the district is thoroughly under control and law abiding. The largest element of the population is of Sudanese blood, partly unemancipated slaves, but chiefly those who have gained their freedom. With these are the Muwallads, Sudanese with an Arab strain, and over them the Arabs of pure blood and the Sa'dah and Ashraf. Sabia itself, of course, contains merchants from other Mohammedan countries, the strongest element coming from the Hadhramaut. Mohammed Yahya Ba Sahi, the chief adviser of the Idrisi, and the Emir of all Mikhlaf el-Yemen, which of course includes Sabia, is from that country. The Idrisi's standing army of about 500 men is entirely recruited from amongst the Sudanese round Sabia, and they can muster about 10,000 men when the general rally is sounded. The following is a list of the chief villages and their approximate number of fightingfmen. Sabia. Chief sections :— Ashraf el-Khawaji Sherif Idam 300 Sa'dah Seyyid el-Hasan 400ASIR 463 Shamran, and other tribes of Asir, trace their descent to the Rijal el-Hajar. The tribe is divided into nine main divisions, the A1 Musheit, A1 Rusheid, A1 Ghamar^ Nahas, Qa'ud, Beni Bijad, Beni Wahhab, Sha'af Rashhah, and A1 Yinfa'ah. The Al Musheit are numerically the smallest, but politically the most important sub-tribe, since they contain the ruling tribal family. In former days its influence over the whole tribe was unquestioned, but since the Idrisi's rise to fame some sections have joined him, while others have remained faithful to the Turks, and discord has crept in and weakened its power. It is still, however, very powerful, and in purely tribal matters has the ultimate word over the majority. The paramount chief is 'Abd el-'Aziz ibn Musheit, now an old man of 60, who lives in considerable state at Dhahban, and also owns a house in Khamis Musheit, the largest and most important trading centre in Asir. Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz is a rich man, since he levies his own taxes in this town, taking a piastre for every donkey sold, 2 piastres for each camel, and 5 piastres for a skin of semn, &amp;c. The Turks do not interfere with him in this, but content themselves with taking from the local cultivators. He is, however, expected to entertain freely members of the outlying sub-tribes who visit him, and always keeps an open house. In his old age he has taken to drink, and leaves all the active management of the tribe to his son, Sa'id ibn 'Abd. The latter, like his father, supported the Turks, but he is also said to be in correspondence with the Idrisi. He is now about 32 years old, and is popular with the tribe and, as a leader, famous in war. The only other man of importance in the family is Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz's nephew, Sa'd ibn Husein, who has been won over by the Idrisi with the promise of the chief Sheikhship if he can oust his uncle and cousin. His appointment, however, would not be popular with the tribe, for he is reputed to be mean and overbearing. His two brothers, 'Abd ibn Ibrahim and Husein ibn 'Abd, ate with him, but have not much influence. The Al Rusheid live round Khamis Musheit and towards Ibha and number about 4,000 men. 'Ali ibn Tteij is their chief Sheikh, a fighter of repute. They all support the Turks, but they refuse to pay them taxes, nor do they join the local gendarmerie. They are a prosperous community and their nomads are rich in a breed of large white sheep. They also own many horses. They have not a good reputation in war. The Al Ghamar are braver than the Al Rusheid and quarrel with them. They live along the Beni Malik boundary, and muster about464 SETTLED TRIBES OE THE WEST 1,000 men, of whom 600 are nomads. Mohammed ibn 'Urur, their W chief Sheikh, dislikes Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz and supports the Idrisi His followers, however, keep very much to their own country and 'J* do not meddle in politics. The Nahas are a purely nomad section and are rich in horses and sheep. They live out to the east along the Abidah boundary, ^ and are of all the Shahran the most famous in war. They do all ^ their fighting on_horseback, principally against the 'Abidah. The Dt; 1 Qa'ud and the A1 Rusheid pay them ' khawah', at the rate of 12 piastres for every well, as a bribe against being plundered, ^ They have no cultivation and live by selling and their animals f® in Khamis Musheit. Their young men are not permitted to wear rings until they have killed a man, and once blooded they cut ^J 1 a notch on the stock of their rifles for each of their victims. Utterly tie! out of hand, they never approach Ibha, and recognize neither the * Turks nor the Idrisi nor their own paramount Sheikh. 'A'idh ■ ibn Jabbar is their chief, a man of 50, who has led them into battle ^ for years. i The Qa'ud are entirely settled in Wadi Tindahah, which flows into the Wadi Shahran, and is the most fertile of all the Shahran W country. They are peaceable and unwarlike, and obedient to Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz. oile The Beni Bijad are a large sub-tribe numbering 10,000 men, of Jp whom 7,000 are nomads. The settled portion lives along the Ibha-Bishah road between A1 Batat and Shafan, and is entirely M agricultural. The nomads are warlike and fight both on horseback ft and on foot. Their cavalry carry lances as well as rifles. They are rt on bad terms with the Beni Wahhab and fight the 'Abidah, Balah- stat mar, and Balasmar. Like most nomads they go up to Bishah for it the date season. Sa'id ibn Hashbal is chief over all the sub-tribe, w, He was formerly with the Turks, but now sides with the Idrisi, wtll and only pays a nominal allegiance to Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz. He * collects tithes from his followers, with whom he is popular, and is «■ a rich man. * The Beni Wahhab are the largest sub-tribe, numbering 15,000 'fltt men, of whom 13,000 are nomads. They live in the Wadi Shahran up to Bishah. Of all Arabs they have the most evil reputation, i), They are robbers and highwaymen, treacherous, even to then guests, have little religion and no marriage laws, and kill women and children in their raids, a custom which is execrated by all other fighting tribes. They are also unclean in their feeding and eat rats and jerboas. The man with the strongest hand rules them, and the present Sheikh, Nasir ibn Heif, and Heif ibn Nasir, his son, won ^ASIR 465 their position by forcibly ejecting the former Sheikh, Ibn Hashal. who has now degenerated into a petty and uninfluential high wayman. They are against every tribe and every government, and are paid by other weaker tribes to refrain from raiding. The villagers of Bishah and the clans who live near, such as the Rimathan, Uqlub, and Beni Sulul, are, however, slightly more civilized. Only during the date season at Bishah, which lasts about four months, there is a general truce, and Arabs from all over the country mil foregather. Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz owns large and valuable date- » groves, and both the Sherif of Mecca and the Idrisi have agents tin- there. These two agents belong to the Beni Wahhab, Sheikh tk Yahya ibn Fa'iz acting for the Sherif, and Nasir ibn Kurkman for the Idrisi, for the purpose of collecting The former is the more influential. The Beni Wahhab go out to Tathlith at certain seasons of the year, where there is excellent grazing for their many flocks and herds. The Sha'af Rashhah and A1 Yinfa'ah occupy the Tihamah to the south of Ibha, from which they are separated by the Beni Mugheid. The Sha'af Rashhah, who are to the_north of the A1 Yinfa'ah, are entirely settled and peaceful. The Al Yinfa'ah live in the district of Temniyah (Thimniyah), which is the most fertile of all Asir, and approach to within 20 miles of Sabia. They are numerous and wealthy, and have a good reputation for hospitality and courage, 'Abdullah ibn Hamad is the chief Sheikh of both sections, a tall man of about 55, with a long white beard. He was formerly on the side of the Turks, but broke with them and with Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz about 8 years ago, when his son was murdered by the Beni Wahhab, while a guest of Sheikh 'Abd el-'Aziz. Since then he has joined the Idrisi, and, being a man of great influence, has brought his tribe with him. The Idrisi now collects taxes from them and keeps about 100 police at Temniyah. The enemies of these two sub- tribes are the Rufeidat el-Yemen and Rabi'ah ; their friends, the Arabs of Mikhlaf el-Yemen. The nomads of Al Yinfa'ah are horse- owners and sell their stock in the Sabia market. (a) Al Musheit. 'Abd el-'Aziz ibn Musheit, paramount Sheikh : Sa'id ibn 'Abd, his son.

Beni The Beni Shi'bah live chiefly round 'Itwad ('Itwid) and up the Wadi Dhilah to the Rabi'at el-Yemen boundary, but their nomads have no fixed boundaries and wander all over Mikhlaf el-Yemen, north of Sabia. Their Sheikhs and chief families are Arabs and trace their descent to Qahtan, but the majority of the tribe are Sudanese, who have been emancipated for many generations. They are excellent fighters, amenable to discipline, and are generally known as 'Asakir or soldiers. They all support the Idrisi and pay him taxes. The Beni Shi'bah do not engage in trade, the villagers being agri culturists and the nomads possessing large herds of camels, cattle, and sheep. They also own horses and nearly always fight as cavalry. They are friendly with the Munjahah, Rijal el-M'a, and the Mikhlaf tribes, but are hereditary enemies of the Rabi'at el-Yemen and generally on bad terms with the Beni Mugheid, whose country they avoid.

They are a tall and well-made race and their women are noted for their beauty. They inhabit the country from the Tihamah 25 miles east of Qunfudah up the main mountain range and across the watershed almost to Wadi Shahran. The tribes which adjoin them are, on the north, starting from the Tihamah, the Bal'aryan, Bulqarn, and Beni 'Amr, on the east the Shahran, on the south the Balasmar, the Reish, the Al Musa ibn 'Ali, the Humeidah, and the Rabi'ah Mujatirah. On the west, where their boundary has narrowed to about 15 miles, are the470 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST Zobeid. Their territory is funnel-shaped, widening out as it goes inland, till it reaches the Shahran in the east, with whose boundary it marches for over 60 miles. The settled portion of the tribe have shown little sympathy with the Idrisi. They are divided into three main sections, the north south, and Tihamah, ruled over by different Sheikhs, who are usually on bad terms with each other, but unite against common enemies. The largest section and the most important politically is the Beni Shihir esh-Sham, who live chiefly along the Ibha-Ta'if road, between 'Asabili and 'Uqrum. The leading family, and one of the noblest of Asir, is that of Ibn Qurum, closely connected with Mecca, both ! by sympathy and relationship, Sherif Mohammed ibn 'Abd el-Mu'in ibn 'Aun, the grandfather of the present Sherif, having married into the family. The present head of the family is Sa'id ibn Fa'iz, an old man now, with two sons, both born of a Circassian mother, Earaj Bey ibn Sa'id, who has been one of the Hejaz representatives in the Ottoman Parliament, and Fa'iz ibn Sa'id. They all visit Constantinople and Mecca regularly, have a house in Ibha, and have furnished their house at 'Asabili in semi-European style, and, having also adopted the western habit of smoking and drinking, are looked at with dislike and suspicion by other tribes. They are, however, large landowners and rich men. Faraj Bey ibn Sa'id is a tall man of about 38, with a fair skin, which he gets from his mother. He was formerly Kaimmakam of Qunfudah, Muha'il, and Hali district, where his cruelty when in his cups made him greatly feared. He speaks Turkish and French and has a Circassian wife in Constantinople. He is a notorious libertine and drunkard, but is a force to be reckoned with. His brother, Fa'iz ibn Sa'id, a young man of 25, is much more steady and takes greater interest in tribal matters. About a third of the Beni Shihir esh-Sham are nomads, whose main subdivision is that of the Neid. They have little to do with the settled parts, and do not acknowledge Sa'id ibn Fa'iz, the Sherif, or the Turks. Most of their life is spent in bickering with the Shahran, but what political leanings they have are in favour of the Idrisi. The Beni Shihir el-Yemen occupy the rich district of Namas and are under 'Ali Bey ibn Dhafir, who, like the Qurum family, i s strongly pro-Turk. He is, however, a man of much stricter morals, and is respected by the tribes. His mother is a Circassian. ThisASIR 471 section is entirely settled in permanent villages, and provided a large proportion of the local Turkish gendarmerie. There are said to be a few Idrxsi sympathizers among them. The Beni Shihir of the Tihamah are neither as numerous nor as powerful as those of the uplands, but their country is fertile and they are more prosperous than most of their neighbours. Their Chief Sheikh is Abu Mismar, who is said to favour the Idrisi secretly. The nomads under Sheikh Khadan ibn Mohammed, are all on the Idrisi side. They live chiefly in 'Aqabah Sajein and 'Aqabah Sihan, between the Namas district and the Tihamah, but go down to lower ground for the harvest. The Beni Shihir are a good fighting tribe, and on account of their political tendencies are almost hemmed in by foes, the Balasmar being the only tribe with whom they have a pact. The Zobeid and they have a feud of many years' standing. They are well armed, having received rifles from the Turks at Ibha. They are descended from the Rijal el-Hajar.

Sham The Shamran occupy a part of the high upland country through which runs the Ibha-Ta'if road and extend down the slopes of the hills to the Tihamah. They are bounded on the west and north by the Ghamid, on the east by the Shahran, and on the south by the Khath'am and Bulqarn. They are divided into the Shamran esh-Sham, Shamran et-Tihamah, and the nomads, each section numbering about 2,000 men. The northern Shamran and the nomads are under the Sheikhship of Hasan ibn Matar, a young man of 30, who has a good reputation for wisdom in tribal matters, and has made a name for himself in war. Their chief centre is Balus, the largest of a number of villages near the Khath'am border, set in a rich and well- wooded valley. The nomads, the Suhab and A1 Mubarak, wander down into the Tihamah in the winter, or stay round Balus, and in the summer go up with the Bulqarn and other nomads to the Shahran country round Bishah for the date season. They own many sheep and goats, but few camels. The most important section of the Shamran et-Tihamah is the 'Ubus, under Sheikh Is-haq ibn Muzellaf, whose chief village is Marwa'. They have permanent villages in which they live during winter, but in summer most of them lead a nomadic life, living in straw-woven tents. The whole tribe unites in war, their chief enemies being the Ghamid. They are also usually at odds with their weaker neighbour the Khath'am. Their reputation as a fighting race is good, and they share with the Bulqarn the custom of purifying themselves and wearing their finest clothes before going into battle. In normal times they are a hospitable and light- hearted race, ever ready to find an excuse for relaxation. Marriage474 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST festivals are celebrated on a much larger scale than is usual in Asir Their outside political leanings are strongly in favour of the Idrisi as against the Sherif of Mecca and the Turks.

The territory between these roads is theirs, and their boundary on the north approaches within 5 miles of Muha'il. Their neighbours on the north are the A1 Musa and Reish, on the east the Balasmar, on the south the A1 Nahyah and Al Haritli of the Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah, and on the west the Bahr ibn SekeinaL The tribe numbers some 2,000 men, of whom two-thirds are settled, the remainder nomad. They are a bold and fearless tribe who live chiefly by raiding, and unprotected parties, either of the Turks or ordinary travellers, are never safe while in their country. They have never submitted to Ottoman authority, and, since the rise of the Idrisi, have quite got out of hand. Their chief Sheikh, Sheikh Sarwi, is one of the most noted highwaymen of Asir, and has given endless trouble to the Government. They are generally at feud with the Al Musa, Rabi'ah wa Rufeidah, and Balasmar, and are still allied with the Rijal el-Ma and Balahmar. Their relations with the Bahr Ibn Sekeinah are neutral.

Beni The Beni Ya'lah are a small settled tribe, numbering 500 men, situated along the coast a few miles north of Hali. They are bounded on the north by the Marahibah section of the Beni Zeid, on the east by the Aulad el-'Alaunah section of the Ahl Hali, and on the south by the Shawarah section of the Ahl Hali. They are divided amongst themselves. Sheikh Bahran of Shija'fah favouring the Idrisi, and the remainder, under Sheikh Beit-'ali Abu 'Atanah, paying allegiance to the Turks. The Bela'ir and Hali both raid them, and they depend chiefly on the Turks for their existence as a tribal unit, since they are as unwarlike as their only allies, the Beni Zeid.

Zah The Zahran is one of the largest tribes of Asir and is bounded on the north by the Beni Malik and Shalawah, on the east by the Ghamid, on the south and south-west by the Zobeid, and on the west by the Dhawi Barakat for a few miles and then the Dhawi Hasan. Their western boundary approaches in places to within476 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST 15 miles of the coast, and inland they go up the main mnnntai. range and beyond the Ibha-Ta'if road. Their country is a fertile one and is thickly populated, the whole tribe being said to number 30,000 men. It is divided into two main divisions, the settled and the nomad each of equal size. Rashid ibn Jum'an is paramount sheikh of the villagers and belongs to the main sub-tribe, the Beni Sadr; Sa'id ibn Aseidan rules over the nomads. The former got his title by inheritance, the latter by his prowess in war; but they are both good men' and have their tribesmen well in hand. When he was a young man, Rashid ibn Jum'an sided with the Turks and was made a Bey, but twelve years ago he raised a successful revolt and has barred the country to the Turks ever since. The nomads were always against them and against the villagers for the same reason, but since the revolt the two chief sheikhs have been good friends. Rashid ibn Jum'an is now a large fat man of He lives at Jebel_Dus and is married to Nafalah of the Aulad el-Emir Mohammed ibn 'A'idh family of the Beni Mugheid. The Zahran are purely a fighting race, and never leave their country except to raid. They cultivate and become rich thereby, but they despise all other forms of manual labour. The Ghamid are their great and hereditary enemies. They declared for the Idrisi when he first raised his standard in Asir, and fought for him in 1912 against the Turks and Sherif of Mecca In May 1915 they wrote to the Idrisi, proposing to join him, hut the Idrisi, doubtless realizing that they could do little good while hedged in between the Turks at Ibha and the Sherif, advised them to adopt a passive attitude for the present. He, however, sent a Qadhi to them to obtain monetary help, and early in 1916 reported that he was still in friendly communication with them. The Zahran, like several other tribes of Asir, trace their descent to Rijal el-Hajar. (a)Settled :— Paramount Sheikh ; Rashid ibn Jum'an. 15,000 men.

To the north they inhabit the villages along the Qunfudah-Lith road for some 14 miles, till they reach the boundary of the A1 Difra section of the Zobeid. To the east they stretch along the Barak road for 12 miles, almost to 'Umr of the Nawashirah section of Bela'ir, and then, keeping always about 10 miles from the coast, their boundary runs south for 20 miles, marching first with the confines of the Muja'adah section of the Bela'ir and then with the 'Umr Bedawi till it reaches the Beni Ya'lah, when it turns due west to the coast. They are partly settled and partly nomad, the former numbering about 4,000 men, the latter 3,000. The villagers are by no means wealthy, but there is a sufficiency of rain to enable them to cultivate in the summer, and their wells provide water to grow vegetables in the dry season. The two nomad sections are the Rabi'ah Weinah and the Marahibah, the former strung out along the Qunfudah-Barak road, the latter roaming the country to the south of Qunfudah, along the coast and inland. They are rich in camels, and are the chief carriers to Hali, Muha'il, and Barak. Most of them carry antiquated rifles, swords, and a curved knife about 3 ft. long, called a They also supply Qunfudah with milk, and are looked down on by the more independent tribes, both for this practice and for their lack of prowess in war. Hasan ibn Khidhr is the principal Sheikh of the whole tribe, a man of about 30, who has proved a faithful servant of the Turks. He held firm when the Idrisi threatened Qunfudah in 1912, and was given 2,000 rifles by the Turks for defence. The Beni Zeid doubtless owe a great deal to the Turks, for they are on terms of478 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST enmity with their neighbours the Bela'ir and 'Umr and „ raided by such distant tribes as the Beni Tsa, Dhawi Barats? „ !

The paramount Sheikh of the tribe and of one of its subsections, the Beni 'Aqal, is Mohammed c Ali Sebak. They are on friendly terms with the Beni Hasan, who stand in fear of them, and close allies with the Beni Aslam. They are old enemies of the Beni c Abs, but sink their differences when fighting for Idrisi, as they are doing now. 56. Zobeid The Zobeid are a detached section of the Harb, and indeed are locally called Harb as often as by their real name. When on the Pilgrimage, they generally visit their northern brethren, and are received with honour, and similarly extend a warm welcome to any Harbi who may be in their country. They are hospitable and well conducted, and appear to possess the bravery of their race without its traditional lawlessness. Their boundary starts about 7 miles north of Qunfudah and, after running along the coast for rather more than 20 miles, turns inland and follows the Dhawi Barakat boundary till it reaches the Zahran.—»«.... wssaa ASIR From there it runs parallel to the coast and about 30 miles inland along the confines of the Zahran, Ghamid, Bal'aryan, and Beni Shihir till it reaches a point due east of Qunfudah and then follows the boundaries of the Bela'ir and Beni Zeid to the sea. The Zobeid are settled in permanent villages and are rich in cattle. Their land near the sea is barren, except in the wadis, but increases in richness and fertility as soon as the mountains are reached. They are said to number 15,000 men, and their paramount Sheikh is Mu'adi ibn Khair. The whole tribe is strongly in favour of the Idrisi, and pay him taxes. They are equally strong in their feelings against the Turks, who in spite of their proximity have not ventured to interfere with them for years. Their chief enemies are the Beni Shihir, but they dislike and despise the Beni Zeid. With the Dhawi Barakat, the Ghamid, and Zahran they are friends. The Zobeid go in for gun-running to a certain extent, buying their rifles from Ru'eis near Jiddah, or from Birk, and selling them chiefly to the Zahran, Paramount Sheikh : Mu'adi ibn Khair. 15,000 men.

They own 15 or 20 small villages, of which the largest is Beit Jasliish, Their chief Sheikh is Sheikh Daghshar, a man of about 55, who has considerable influence in the country round. He is a great friend of the Imam and has frequently tried to make peace between him and the Idrisi. 3. Afldh A small and unimportant tribe allied to the Khairan, to the east of the Beni Aslam in Hajur. Half Zeidi. 4. BeniAhlds A small tribe, numbering about 2,400 souls, of the Da'udiyali sect, settled to the east of the Beni Murrah and Beni Muqatil, with whom they are allied. They are good fighters and support the Turks, chiefly by reason of their hatred of the Imam and his Zeidi followers. Coffee and Icat are grown in their country. Their chief Sheikh is Nasir Husein el-Ahlasi, an old man of about 65, who visited Constantinople just before the deposition of Sultan Abdel- Hamid. Chief villages : Seihan, Marabah, Rabitah, and Masna'ah. 5. AM A large and peaceful Zeidi tribe about 20 miles NE. of Qa'tabali, living round Shekab 'Ammar, and cultivating cereals and in Wadi Bana.

A The boundaries of the Anis stretch from a short distance west of Dhamar due north nearly to Wa'lan, keeping always a short distance to the west of the Dhamar-San'a road. To the west they extend along the B. Matar confines almost to Mefhaq and then, skirting Menakhah, and cutting the W. Siham, go down a few miles south of Jebel Reima, and then across almost to Dhamar. The paramount Sheikh is 'Ali Miqdad, who lives at Jebel esh- Sharq. He is a man of about 50, and used to be a firm adherent of the Imam. He fought for him in 1911 and captured the Turkish Kaimmakam of Dhur'an, Zakari Bey. In August 1916, however, ARABIA I tt Vi482 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST he was reported to have quarrelled with the Imam and closed the road against him. The Imam accused him of collecting revenues for himself; and dispatched the Dhamar Arabs against him, with what result is not known. The tribe numbers from 8,000 to 10,000 men, but not more than 3,000 can take the field owing to lack of rifles. Their country is fertile, wheat, oats, barley, and being the principal crops. They are on good terms with their northern neighbours the Beni Matar. They dislike the Arabs of Jebel Reima. and also the Khaulan, whom they fought 12 years ago. With the Beni Muqatil, who are of the Da'udiyah sect and opposed to the Imam, they have a long-standing feud. There is a well -known Seyyid at Dhur'an, their chief town, by name Seyyid' Ali ibn Isma'il.

Beni 483 A small Zeidi tribe south-west of the Beni Husein and Wadi La'ah, and about 50 miles due east of Loheia in the mountains. Their chief Sheikhs are 'Ali Da'am and Husein ibn Hasan. They come under the suzerainty of the Turks, but are said to be discontented with them and with the Imam. 11. Beni 'Aziz A small Zeidi tribe of Hajar el-Yemen, living at Hubur Meili just to the south of the Beni Zafir and Beni Ghill with whom they are allies. Formerly under the Turkish Markaz of Qufl, but came under the Imam by the treaty of 1911. Good fighters. Noted for their fruits, coffee, and Jcat. 12. B See Hdshid Bekll. 13. Zeidi tribe living in Jebel Bura', SSW. of 'Ubal. Chief Sheikh is Husein ibn 'Abd er-Rahman el-Bura', who is on unfriendly terms with the Imam, and hates the Turks, under whose immediate juris diction he is. He is a friend of Nasir ibn Mabkhut of the Hashid. The tribe is allied to the Hufash, Sari, and Mahweit. They are a peace-loving people, numbering about 2,000 men. Yahya 'Abad is the Sheikh appointed by the Turks over Jebel Bura', Hajeilah, and 'Ubal. He is about 65 years of age and lives at Hajeilah, which, with 'Ubal, can muster about 400 men. The chief villages are Manwab, Kamah, Fayish, and Rukab. 14. Al A small tribe to the E. of the Al 'Ammar, with whom it is generally at feud. Little is known of it except that it is Zeidi and under the Imam. The chief Sheikh is Sa'd ibn Sa'd. The chief Seyyids are 'Ali ed-Damaji and Husein Merza'. The chief clans are Al el-Wadi (Sheikh 'Abdullah), Al 'Utuf, and Al 'Awadah (Sheikh Qahtan Damaji). 15.

Beni Ghill A small Zeidi tribe of Hajur el-Yemen living in Mikhlaf el -Yemen between the tribes of Beni Zafir on the north and Beni 'Aziz on the south, with whom they are allied. Formerly under the Turkish Markaz of Qufl, but since the treaty of 1911 under the Imam' good fighters. Noted for their fruits, coffee, and kat. 17.^ Small Zeidi tribe in and round the town of Hajjah (Hadda). There is a Kaimmakam in Hajjah, so they come under the direct jurisdiction of the Turks, whom they dislike, and against whom they fought in 1911. Since the Imam made peace with the Turks their relations with him have been strained. Paramount Sheikh is 'All ibn Hizam. The tribe is descended from Beni Tamim. 18. There are two sections of the Hamdan, both claiming descent from Qahtan. (a) Hamdan esh-Sham, a very large Zeidi tribe, almost entirely Bedouin, and roaming over the country a day and a half to the north-east of Sa'dah. They are bounded on the north by the Yam tribes of Nejran, east by the Bekil, west by Bedouin tribes, and south by Bekil nomads. At present they are on bad terms with the Imam. They are quite independent, and will fight for any one who pays them. Chief Sheikh is Sherif Salih ibn'Ali. They are of the same stock as the Hamdan el-Yemen, but too far off to be in touch. (b) Hamdan el-Yemen. Living to the W. and N. of San'a, chiefly in Wadi Dhahir. They are of the same origin as the Hamdan esh-Sham. Owing to close proximity to San'a, they do not show their real feelings,but are said to dislike the Turks and the Imam, and to have a secret under standing with Nasir ibn Mabkhut of the Hashid. Their chief Sheikh, 'Ali Shawi', is in the pay of the Turks with the rank of mudir. Chief clans : B. Dhurhan (Sherif 'Ali Hamud), B. Beshir (Sheikh 'Alawi), B. 'Afar, B. Dhayyan, B. Harith, B. Meimun (Salih ibn Meimun), B. Jabran.(244 YEMEN 486 jil, | Chief villages : Mehajir ('Ali Matlaq), Luqmah ('Ali Yahya el- Hamdani), Tubar ('Ali et-Tubri), Qebil (Ahmed Salamah). 19. H A small Sunni tribe living a few miles south of the Turkish post of Zeidiyah, east of the Kamaran Islands, and coming under the juris diction of 'Abdullah Pasha el-B5ni. To their south is the Quhrah tribe. They number between 250 and 300 fighting men, and their chief Sheikhs are Isma'il 'Ali and 'Abdullah Mashhur. Their chief villages are Qaryah, Dar el-Bahri, and Mahal. 20. Beni Hasheish AZeidi tribe immediately to the north-east of San'a, living in Wadi Sirr, Wadi Sawan, and down to Jebel Nuqum. They cultivate grapes extensively and also engage in trading. They muster some 1,500 men, but, living so near San'a, possess few rifles. In sym pathy they are pro-Imam. Their chief Sheikh is Muhsin el-Jamrah. 21. Hdsh Bektl It is not clearly established whether the Hashid wa Bekil are all of the same descent and therefore one tribe, or a confederation of two tribes of differing origin. The available evidence seems to show that the Hashid trace their descent back to Himyar and the Bekil to Qahtan. Whatever the truth, there is no doubt that their names are commonly linked together by natives in Yemen, that they are on terms of close friendship and have been so for many generations, and that together they form one of the most powerful tribal bodies in Southern Arabia. The home country of the Bekil is to the east in Marashi and Barat, but, as will be seen from the description given below, there are also tribal units living in the midst of the Hashid country and even so far south and west as Hajjah, Wadi Shirs, and Mahweit. The Hashid occupy the country from a few miles north of 'Amran almost to Sa'dah, and to the west they extend almost to Hajur. To the east they are settled in Bilad el-Kharf and round Dhibin, but their nomads wander far jjl afield to the north and towards Barat and Jauf. For many generations the fortunes of the Hashid wa Bekil have been intimately connected with those of the Imams of Yemen; and this must always be so, both on account of their common creed and because some of the chief strongholds of the Imam, such as Sheharah, Qafilat 'Udhr, and Madan, are set in the midst of the486 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST Hashid country. The Imams have drawn largely on the confedera tion for their fighting material, and in return have rewarded its chief men by governorships in different parts of the country. Thus before the Ottoman conquest, the chief family of the Himran tribe of Hashid ruled all the country from Najrah to Wadi La' and Kaukeban, and the head of the Wada' governed Mikhadir just south of Jiblah. The leading Bekil Sheikhs were equally powerful' and the family of Ausat held the overlordship of Ibb, Suhul, 'Udein' Nadrah, and Ta'izz, while the family of Sha'if were Emirs of Hajjah and Zufeir. The conquest of the Yemen by Mukhtar Pasha in 1872 and the consequent restriction of the power of these Sheikhs left them with a strong hatred of the Turks and a lasting desire to regain their lost territories ; and the many Yemenite revolts against Ottoman authority during the last forty years have always seen them taking a leading part. They bitterly resented the declaration of peace in 1911, and the Imam's treachery towards Idrisi; and his proposition that they should pay taxes to the Turks caused Nasir ibn Mabkhut, the chief of the Himran and paramount Sheikh of the Hashid, to withdraw his tribes and enter into relations with the Idrisi. A truce was arranged in the following year ; but there is still bad feeling between the two which is not likely to cease until the Imam declares definitely against the Turks. The defection of so powerful a body of supporters has of course reacted in favour of Idrisi, who during the last few years has been steadily working to make the feeling permanent. He has, however, to contend against a sentiment of loyalty to the Imam, which has been handed down for many generations, and his lack of ready cash has prevented him from doing more than keep relations between the latter and the confederation strained. He has been in constant touch with its chief Sheikhs for the last few years, and has said that money is the only thing required to bring them on his side. The outstanding figure of the Hashid wa Bekil confederation is Sheikh Nasir ibn Mabkhut. This Sheikh, a man of forcible and ruthless character, has gained almost complete ascendancy over the Hashid tribesmen and largely influences the Bekil chiefs. He is cruel and unscrupulous, and will join whichever side pays him most. His power is such that, given adequate material help, he can in all probability force the Imam to what terms he likes. No attempt has been made to estimate numbers in the accoun which follows, but the confederation is said to have put over 50,000 men in the field against the Turks in 1911.YEMEN 487 A. HASHID The boundaries of the Hashid have already been described. The tribe is largely an agricultural and pastoral one, but certain sections, especially the Himran, are engaged in trade. The most important sub-tribes are the Himran, Dhu 'Udhrah, and Dhu Fari', and most of the tribal policy seems to be guided by Sheikhs Salih ibn Muslih, Salih Ma'id, Mas'ud el-Barak, and Dirhem ibn Yahya, under the direction of Sheikh Nasir ibn Mabkhut. The only sections which have stood out against them and solidly sup ported the Imam are the Ahnum, Al Ahim, Zuleimah, and the southernmost tribes, the Beni Surih and Arhab, The country of the Hashid is by no means uniformly fertile, and, in consequence, there are many nomad sections. Theoretically taxes are payable to the Imam, but of late years they have mostly found their way into the coffers of Nasir ibn Mabkhut. The Seyyids are very powerful in the Hashid country, Huth being their most important centre in the Yemen after San'a and Sa'dah. They stand with the Imam, or against him, according to the favours they receive from him. His meanness and parsimony seem to have sent the majority into Nasir ibn Mabkhut's camp. The tribes which follow are placed in the order of what is believed to be their numerical and political importance, irrespective of their geographical position. i. Himban Chief Sheikhs :— Nasir ibn Mabkhut. Tall, powerfully built, fair skinned with a small white beard. About sixty. Ambitious and unscrupulous. Rules chiefly by fearj Is rich through taxes levied on his people. His two chief sons are Hamud (age about 35) and Nasir (age about 25). His chief strong holds are at Hamri, Habur, and Dhofir. Salih ibn Muslih. Nephew of Nasir ibn Mabkhut and his most important lieutenant. Age about 40. Is rich and generous, and well liked by the people. Lives at Hamri. Range :— {a)The majority live in villages between Khamir and Huth. {b) There are several small sections in Wadi La'ah and Hajjah. The Himran traders travel over most of the Yemen. There are many of them in San'a and Hodeidah.YEMEN 493 Sub-Tribes :— Beni Bu'san,. Beni Adham, Beni 'Afar, Beni Mezwad, Beni Laqamah, Beni Jalid, Beni Dugheish, Beni Dhofar, Beni Hideyah, Beni Harash, Beni Qafan. B. BEKIL The Bekil are mainly settled in the oases of Barat, Ruhub, and Khabb, which lie some days to the NE. of the Hashid territory, and they are engaged chiefly in the raising of horses and sheep. The most powerful tribe both in numbers and in military prowess is that of the Dhu Mohammed, whose Sheikhs have nearly all fol lowed the fortunes of Nasir ibn Mabkhut. The Bekil tribesmen do not find their home-country sufficient for all their needs, and many have emigrated to Jauf and different parts of the Hashid country. Thus whole tribes are found in the latter, such as the Beni Malik near Sheharah and the Beni Jabr round Sudah, while there are still in Hajjah, Wadi Shirs, and Mahweit survivors from the old days when the Bekil Sheikhs were all-powerful in those districts. The Bekil and Hashid Sheikhs are on terms of close friendship with the Dhu Husein of Jauf, so much so that the latter are sometimes spoken of as a part of the Bekil. But there is no doubt that the Dhu Husein are descended from the Ashraf (Sherifs), and they are there fore dealt with separately. The chief Sheikhs of the Bekil are Abdullah ibn Ghazeilan, Yahya ibn Yahya esh-Sha'if, Naji' ibn Yahya and Abu Harbah. No personal details are known about them except that they rose with Nasir ibn Mabkhut in 1911 against the Imam and have followed his fortunes ever since. The influence of the Seyyids of Huth is almost as strong amongst the Bekil as amongst the Hashid. The Emir Seyyid Ibrahim Muhsin er-Rusas of Huth is their chief Hakim Shera'i, and he has agents all over their country collecting tithes. The chief Bekil tribes are as follows :— i. Dhu Mohammed Chief Sheikhs :— Abdullah ibn Ghazeilan, of Dhu Ghazeilan. Yahya ibn Yahya esh-Sha'if, of Sha'if. Naji' ibn Yahya, of A1 Ausat. Abu Harbah. Range :— (a) The majority in Barat. Chief villages : Suq el-Anan arid Rajuzah.YEMEN 495 v. Beni Malik Chief Sheikhs :— Ibn 'Ajman. Mohammed el-Kamarani. Range :— Settled south of Beni 'Arjalah in Hashid country. Chief villages are Rahabah, Harfah, Say at, Heifah. Sub-Tribes :— (a) Settled :— Beni Sinan, Beit el-Haddi, Da'udah, Beni 'Askar, Beni Iswid, Beni Thaqafah, Beni Kenanah. (b) Nomads :— Beni Da'ud, Beni Eadl, Beni Misbah. 22. BeniHubeish A Zeidi tribe about 40 miles west of San'a. Revolted with the Kam'alah and other Zeidi tribes under Emir esh-Shibi against the Turks in 1914. 23. Beni Hibah A small Zeidi tribe under the Imam to the east of the Beni Aslam in Hajur. 24. Hufdsh A tribe between Jebel Melhan and Bajil. They are Zeidis and belong to the Imam, though they come immediately under the authority of the Turks, whom they hate. They are allies of their northern neighbours the Sari and Mahweit, and also with the Bura' of Jebel Bura'. Chief Sheikh is 'Ali ibn Yahya. 25. Beni A small Zeidi tribe just to the NW. of Hisn Jemimah and west of the Beni 'Udhaqah and Jebel Meswar. Pro-Imam. Sheikh, Ahmed Husein. Formerly under Seyyid Ahmed ibn Mohammed el-Kaukebani, Emir of Kaukeban and the surrounding country. Seyyid Ahmed was defeated by Mukhtar Pasha and died in captivity at San'a. His family, Beit Sheraf ed-Din, fled to Huth. There is a small Turkish garrison at Hisn Jemimah.496 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST 26. Dh The Dhu Husein are a powerful tribe of Sherifial descent inhabit ing the fertile oasis of Jauf. Although somewhat isolated by reason of the distance which separates them from the main centres, the; have always kept in close political and commercial touch and havi: played an important part in the history of the Yemen. Theii relations have always been intimate with the Hashid wa Bekil so much so that they are sometimes spoken of as forming an integral part of that confederation. The troubles between the latter and the Imam have had their effect on the Dhu Husein and drawn them into two opposing camps, of which the larger seems to have remained faithful to its old allegiance. There are several Sheikhs who appear to rank equally in impor tance. Of these, Sherif Ahmed ibn Husein has always supported the Imam and gave him valuable help against the Turks in 1911. Sherif Muhsin ibn 'Abdullah is also a trusted friend and was sent by the Imam to Aden on a political mission in August 1911 Previously he had commanded an army against the Idrisi. The chief opponent of the Imam and a close friend of Nasir ibn Mabkhut is Husein ibn Thawabah. The tribe is noted for its fighting qualities, and its Sheikhs are better educated than is commonly the case in Yemen, their capital, Matamah, being a well-known centre of learning. Tlie Dhu Husein go in largely for horse-breeding, and own perhaps it best pedigree stock in Southern Arabia. The chief sub-tribes are : A1 Thawabah (Sheikh Husein ibn Thawabah); Beni Furyan (Sheikh Suleiman ibn Ahmed) ; Dhu Gheilan ; A1 Wajhah (Sheikl Nasir el-Akhram) ; Dhu 'Akam ; Beni 'Aseyan ; Beni Hashim. 27. BeIsmd'il A small Shafei tribe in the mountains round Menakhah, numbering about 2,500 souls, and neutral during its siege in 1911. They are now under Turkish domination.

The chief clans are : A1 Jaradi, Aj 1 Jebali, Beni 'Atiyah, Beni Bisher, and Beni Rajah. The cbie villages are Masaribah, Jalbein, Jurn Ja'dal, and Jurn 'Arah. 28. A Shafei tribe just north of Loheia and east as far as Zahiwl which is their chief village. In 1011 they fought the Turks onYEMEN 497 behalf of Idrisi, but they are now close allies of Ibn El-Heij of the Wa'zat. The chief Sheikh is Mohammed Zeid, who comes from the Ashraf of S&amp;bia, and is Mudir of Zahirah. He is under his cousin Sherif Hamud, the Kaimmakam of Loheia, who lives at Mutaridh, and governs the Beni Jami' and Wa'zat. 29. Jeml A small Zeidi tribe living round Jebel Jemimah, about 15 miles east of Qufl in Hajur. They are outside Turkish jurisdiction, and are ruled by the Imam's nominee, Seyyid Ahmed ibn Qasim. Their chief Sheikh is 'Ali ibn Nasir. 30. Beni A powerful and independent Zeidi tribe, partly nomad but chiefly settled, living in the country north-east of Abu 'Arish almost to Jebel Razah. Eight years ago the important Sheikh, Seyyid ed-Dahyani, at that time Emir of Sa'dah and district, quarrelled with the Imam and fled to the Beni Juma'ah for protection. Since then he has lived with them and established a firm place for himself amongst them. He is a great friend of the Idrisi, whom the Beni Juma'ah also support. 31. Kam' A Zeidi tribe about 40 miles west of San'a, which revolted with the Beni Hubeish and others against the Turks in 1914 under Emir esh-Shibi. 32. Khau There are two branches of this tribe. (1)_ Khaulan et-Tawal. A Zeidi tribe to the east and south of San'a, inhabiting the country on either side of Wadi Meswar. They are settled and agricultural, and number 7,000 to 8,000 fight ing men. Kibs, 3 hours due east of San'a, is their chief town, and the head-quarters of the influential Seyyid family of Kibs. Seyyid Ahmed Mab'uth el-Kibsi and his brothers Seyyid Husein and Seyyid Mohammed ibn Isma'il are the heads of the family. The Khaulan have always fought for the Imam. The representative of the Imam, who is responsible for the collection of tithes, is Seyyid Abbas. The Khaulan dislike the Anis, and fought them 12 years ago owing to the expulsion of a Khaulani from Anis. AEABIA I r .•ratmh Zsr^ YEMEN 499 ll0ham ®^ 35.

Makdrimah A small remnant, numbering about 2,600 men, of the house of Makrami, the ruling family of Yam, still left in the district of Haraz. For 12 years the Makramis held the Emirate of Heima, Haraz, Menakhah and district by gift from the Imam Muhsin, but they were expelled by Mukhtar Pasha in 1872. Their followers who remained behind have little political importance now, and are chiefly engaged in trade. Like the rest of their tribe they are of Isma'iliyah sect. In 1911 they fought for the Turks against the Imam. They occupy the villages of Mugharibah, Safiyah, Beit el-Hud, Khiyam, Beit el-Ghail, Beit el-Akhbari, and Qushamin. Their chief Sheikh is Qa'id el-Luf, who lives at Mugharibah. They are continually at feud with the Shafei, Zeidi, and Da'udiyah tribes of the vicinity. 38.

They bear no love to the Turks, but on that occasion were glad to receive arms and food from the Kaimmakam of Menakhah in return for their help. They are of the Da'udiyah sect and are markedly hostile to their Zeidi co-religionists, such as the Anis. They muster between 2,400 and 2,700 fighting men, and are allied with the Beni Murrah and Beni Ahlas. 48. Beni A small tribe of the Da'udiyah sect, inhabiting with the Muqatil and Beni Ahlas, their allies, the country between Menakhah and Mefhaq.

The country is fertile, and coffee is largely grown, while there is said to be gold in the mountains. They claim descent from Khazraj, and acknowledge as chiefs Sheikh Ahmed ibn Salih and Seyyid 'Ali ibn Huseini. The chief clan is the Dhu Hatim (Sheikh Sa'd 'Abdullah). Seyyid Yahya'Aral ibn Nasir, one of Idrisi's chief muqdamis, administers the countif of both the Ahl Razah and the Beni Juma'ah. 56. Ah The Ahl Reimah occupy the fertile Reimah massif, always spokeii of by Arabs as the finest district in Yemen. Coffee, fruits of at !YEMEN 503 sorts, and cereals are produced. The district is bounded on the N. by J. Bura' and Wadi Siham ; E. by Salfiyah and J. 'Utmah ; S. by Wadi Reimah, and W. by the 'Abs and Zaranik districts. The Sheikh is Murshid ibn Mohammed el-Jabi, who is Turkish Kaim- makam. The Mudir is Seyyid Mahmud. There are said to be seventy Sheikhs and seventy districts in J. Reimah, and a total strength of over 50,000 men. The principal clans are : Beni Waghid, Jad, Sa'id, Walid, Mukhtar, Tuleibi, Mas'ab, Ghuzi, Nomah, Yafuz, Ahl Dalamlam, Beni Harazi, Ahmed, Khudam, Ahl Jabi, and Beni en-Nahari. The last defeated a Turkish expedition sent to collect taxes in 1914 and captured the Kaimmakam of Menakhah. Their chief Sheikh is Seyyid 'Abdullah en-Nahari. His brother, the late Sheikh, Yahya, was defeated by the Turks, and died a captive. This clan is generally on bad terms with the Anis. Principal villages: Jabi (head-quarters of the district and of Sheikh Murshid), Raubat en-Nahari (Suq of Sheikh Murshid), Kusmah, 'Alujah (Suq of Sheikh Mahmud), and Hadxyah. 57. Beni A tribe in the mountains WNW. of Menakhah, and separated from it by the Masar block of the Da'udiyah sect. They helped the Turks in 1911, and Abdullah Beshir, their Sheikh, by his friendly co-operation, enabled the Turks to turn the Imam's flank and relieve Menakhah. He is about 65, an experienced fighter. The tribe is a large one, numbering nearly 10,000 souls. It is generally on bad terms with the neighbouring Shafei, Zeidi, and Isma'iliyah tribes. The chief clans are : Beni 'Ali Yahya and Beni Harun. The chief villages are : Metwah, Za'lah, Ashkar, Jari, Sharaji, Mujwan, and Hijri. 58. S The Sahar are a fairly numerous tribe, of which the settled portion lives in and round the town of Sa'dah and is engaged in agriculture and trading. Owing to internal disunion and an absence of tribal fee lin g it does not possess the political importance which its numbers should warrant. The villagers are all under the authority of the Imam, but the nomads are almost completely independent and are accustomed to range far afield to the north and east in the direction of Nejran and Barat. The tribe keeps on good terms as a rule with its neighbours, the Hashid and the Arabs of Khaulan esh-Sham.504 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST 'Ali Ma'wad is the chief Sheikh of the settled portion Sev Ahmed and Qasim el-Hashimi are the representatives of the Ima? Chief clans : Beni Hazim (Sheikh Tabran Muqbil) Beni (Sheikh Taheir), Beni Hamdan and A1 Nuqeim (Sheikh Hamrls! el-Jirbi), Beni Dhufeir (Sheikh 'Abdullah Dahmi), Beni Sineida (Sheikh Ahmed Sineidar), Beni Huran and Beni 'Umarah (Sewid Qasim), Beni Jurman (Ahmed el-Hashimi), Beni Juma'ah Sheildi Dahmash). v Nomads Chief clans : A1 Sinan and 'Amalacjah (Sheikh Salih Qadir) Beni 'Ajlah and Beni Hureimah (Sheikh Ibn el-'As), Beni Shami and Beni Beddar (Sheikh 'Ali el-Wada'i), Beni 'Awad and Beni Haddad (Sheikh Mansur el-Haddad). M 59. A tribe just north of the Hufash and south of the Ahl Jebel Milhan, whose chief Sheikh is Salih ibn Muslih. They are Zeidis and under the Imam, but their country is administered by the Turks, whom they hate. Allied with their northern neighbours, the Mahweit, also with the Hufash and Bura'. 60. A small Zeidi tribe stretching from just south of San'a to Mehaqarah and the northern edge of the Bilad er-Ruhus. On the east they are bounded by the Khaulan. They are entirely devoted to cultivation, and number about 700 men. Seyyid Mohammed Sibsib of Mehaqarah is the chief Sheikh. The tribe is loyal to the Imam, who has his representative, the Qadhi Lutf ez-Zubeir, living there. The chief villages are : Na'd, Juzah, Qulfan, Hazyaz, Lubad, Safiyah, Mehaqarah, and Sha'asan. 61. Their stronghold is Da'an, 3 hours north of Amran. Their chief is Sheikh Rajih, who was granted the grade of Mirmiran before the Constitution and was made Pasha to secure his loyalty, but he remained staunch to the Imam and fought against the Turks in 1911. Peace was signed at Da'an between Tzzet Pasha and the Imam in 1911.YEMEN 505 62. Ahl A large and peaceful tribe inhabiting the district round Jebel Sha'ir in Southern Yemen. They cultivate and cereals in the fertile valley of Wadi Bana. Their paramount Sheikh is Salih ibn Yahya Hizam, of the Beni Hizam, who comes under the Kaim- makam of Qa'tabah. Sheikh Hajj el-Kabs of the Beni Kabs and Yahya el-Qeishi are also important men in the tribe. 63. Sha A small Zeidi tribe attached to the Imam, north-east of the Beni Aslam, in Hajur. 64. She » A small Zeidi tribe numbering about 1,000 souls, east of the Beni Ghill in Hajur. They pay outward allegiance to the Imam, but are said to favour the Idrisi. Their chief is Seyyid Yahya ibn el-Hadi. 65. Beni The Beni Suleil occupy a large area from the coast opposite Kamaran to the foot of the hills below Jebel Milhan. On the north they have the Bu'ajah, Za'liyah, and Beni Qeis, on the east the Beni Qeis, and on the south the Hashabiri, who are perhaps really only one of their sections. The main road, which runs north and south through the Tihamah near the foot of the hills, passes through their country, as well as that of those other tribes mentioned above, and they and the Beni Qeis control the caravan trade going up to the Wadi Maur. Esti mates of their numbers vary from 1,500 to 10,000 fighting men. The western part of their territory is desert, but they have a good deal of cultivable land under the foot-hills in the east. The tribe supports the Turks, and their two chief men, 'Abdullah el-Boni and 'Abdullah Kauzi, have each received the title of Pasha and been appointed Kaimmakam of Zeidiyah and Mudir of Kenawuz respectively. They are friendly with the Wa'zat but independent of them. Towards the Quhrah they are always hostile. Their chief villages are : Zeidiyah (Sheikh 'Ali Nukar), Kenawuz, Ibn 'Abbas, and Salif on the coast. There are important salt-works at the last named, and a jetty where sea-going ships come alongside. 66. Ahl A large and peaceful tribe living about 13 miles north-west of Qa'tabah, and coming under the Turkish Kaimmakam of that place.506 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST They live round Jebel Madra, and cultivate and cereals in Wd Bana, Hizam es-Sayadi is their chief Sheikh. 67. A Zeidi tribe who claim descent from 'Anazah and 'Adnan and live round Jebel Meswar to the west of 'Amran, where there is a strong fortress at present occupied by the Turks. Their Emir is Seyyid Mohammed ibn El-Hadi, a servant of the Imam. 68. The Wa'zat occupy the country to the north of Loheia, which has been the scene of the recent fighting between the Turks and the Idrisi. To the north Wadi 'Ain and Wadi Warith form the boundary between them and the pro-Idrisi tribe of Beni 'Ahs; to the east are the Beni Nashar ; to the south their boundary is'the Wadi Maur, including Mutaridh and Ghanamah, but not Zahirah, which belongs to the Beni Jami'. Their chief villages areMu'luq, near Jebel Tzzan in the district of Jarb, and Deiramshuma, a forti fied Turkish post about an hour south of Wadi el-'Ain. The para mount Sheikh is Hadi ibn Ahmed el-Heij, a staunch supporter of the Turks who, always anxious to encourage the Sunni opponents of the Idrisi, have made him Pasha and Mudir of the district. He comes second to the Sherif Hamud, one of the Ashraf of Sabia who have seceded from the Idrisi, and who as Kaimmakam of Loheia governs the Wa'zat and their allies, the Beni Jami'. Ibn El-Heij has long been opposed to the Idrisi, and three years ago the Idrisi captured his brother 'Abdullah and still holds him prisoner. With the Beni 'Abs the Wa'zat have an ancient feud. During the Turko- Italian War Ibn el-Heij wavered in his allegiance and took money from the Italians, but in the past two years he has been most active on the Turkish side. In September 1915 he raided the Beni 'Abs and was wounded. The Idrisi retaliated by cutting off his supplies, and Ibn el-Heij, finding himself short of food, and his followers begin ning to desert, appealed to the Imam for help. The latter sent the discouraging reply that he would send troops if they were fed. The Wa'zat are reported to number between l,500to 3,000 fighting men. Sheikh 'Ali Ibrahim is the most important Sheikh after Hadi ibn Heij. 69. A tribe of the Isma'iliyah sect in the district of Haraz, which sided with the Turks against the Imam in 1911.YEMEN 507 70. Yam The Yam tribes form a powerful confederation. They stretch from the northern boundary of the Bekil in Barat up the Wadi Nejran and Wadi Habunah far to the north in the direction of Tathlith and Wadi Dawasir. Joseph Halevy, the only European who has visited their country, found it in 1870 a fertile and productive region inhabited by a well- to-do population. In religion they are Isma'iliyah and are known to the rest of Yemen as the Mu'tazilah or isolated sect; but as Wadi Nejran was the last refuge of Christianity, and has remained far removed from external influence, it is possible that traces of the ancient worship still exist. Halevy was not long enough in the country to verify this, but the tolerance and even favour which he found extended to the Jews in Mikhlaf were hardly in the spirit of strict Mohammedanism. The religious chiefs are probably more orthodox than the bulk of the inhabitants, since they are in com munication, not only with the chief Ashraf of Yemen, but with the Agha Khan, their spiritual head. The ruling family is that of Makrami, descended from their famous ancestor who in the middle of the eighteenth century preached his reforming gospel from Nejran to Hasa. About the middle of the nineteenth century they developed ideas of expansion and obtained from the Imam Muhsin in 1860 the Emirate of Heima, Haraz, and Menakhah. Their tenure, however, was short-lived, as in 1872 they were defeated and banished to their own country by Mukhtar Pasha. There is still a small remnant of the tribe, calling themselves the Makarimah, in the Haraz district, who fought for the Turks in 1911 but are chiefly traders and have little political importance. The present Emir of Nejran is Isma'il el-Makrami, who owes no allegiance. His tribesmen, however, are willing as a rule to serve as mercenaries with either the Imam or the Turks, if well paid. They have a reputation for ruthless bravery. Idrisi has been in negotia tion with them at various times during the present war, hoping with their help to force the Imam's hand against the Turks, but up to the present without result. 71. Beni A small tribe of Ha jar el-Yemen living in Mikhlaf esh-Shems which is noted for its fruits, coffee, and Formerly they were counted as in the Turkish Merkaz of Qufl, but after the treaty of 1911 between the Turks and the Imam they came under the juris-508 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE WEST diction of the latter. They are Zeidis, good fighters, and allied with the neighbouring Zeidi tribes of Beni Ghill and Beni 'Aziz. 72. A small tribe immediately to the south of Loheia and the Wadi Maur down to the Beni Suleil. They are independent of the Wa'zat their northern neighbours, and come under 'Abdullah Pasha el-Bom! Sheikh Hadi 'Ali, living at Dar el-Muhannab, is their chief Sheikli, They number 400 men. 73. Zaranik(Dhardniq) A powerful and warlike tribe divided into two sections, the Zaranik esh-Sham and Zaranik el-Yemen, and occupying the country between the sea and the hills from a few miles north of Beit el-Faqlh almost to Zebid. The Zaranik have for long been a thorn in the side of the Turks, especially during the Turco- Italian War. Repeated expeditions have failed to subdue them, but latterly there have been reports that part of the highland section, under Sheikh 'Ali ibn Hamud, have succumbed to Turkish bribes, Mohammed Yahya Fashik, the chief of the lowland section and paramount over the whole tribe, living at Huseiniyah, nine miles north of Zebid, has, however, continued to hold out stoutly. In November 1915 he made common cause with the Idrisi in taking active measures against the Turks, and has succeeded in effectually cutting all communications in the Tihamah from north to south. At the beginning of 1916 he was attacked by an irregular force from Mocha, increased by 300 Arabs under the leadership of Abela Effendi, the brother of Elias 'Osman, Kaimmakam of Mocha, but unsuccessfully. In May 1916 he again took the offensive and looted the Turkish serai in Beit el-Faqih. The two most important Sheikhs after Sheikh Fashik, and closely allied with him, are Sbami and Munasar Saghir of Kokar, chiefs of the Highland section. Other Sheikhs, of whom nothing is known save their names, are 'Abdullah Munasar of Huseiniyah, Nasir Jurmush, Isma'il Ahmed, Sheikh of Qaramshah, 'Abdullah Duneidinah of Zebid, Ahmed Eisqallah of the Al 'Ali, Hasan Rish of Jiz, Samud of Al Musa, Hasan Mubarak Umm Faza', and Ibrahim Dhumbi of Direihimi. 74. Small Zeidi tribe 5 miles north of the Hajjah, with whomtheyare allied. They come under the Kaimmakam of Hajjah, but are sai to dislike the Turks and to have lost confidence in the Imam.Zsc CHAPTER XV SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH A. Aden Protectorate 1. 'Abdali The Ottoman attack on Aden in July 1915 resulted in the occupation of the 'Abdali country by the Turks, the fall and sack of Lahej, its capital, the death of the ruling Sultan, and the retreat of most of his subjects to the Aden lines. Previous to that event the 'Abdali tribe occupied the country immediately round Aden. Its boundaries extended about 35 miles inland to the Haushabi tribe on the north, to the Fadhli Sultanate on the east, and the Subeihi tribe on the west. Formerly it held the Aden peninsula, until an outrage perpetrated on a shipwrecked crew and the absence of any satisfaction led to the British bom bardment and occupation of Aden in 1839. The Sultan of Lahej, who is the head of the 'Abdali, still receives a yearly subsidy from the British Government for its occupation of the town of Sheikh 'Othman, and leases to it a large area of land in the neck of the isthmus. The present Sultan, Abd el-Kerim ibn Fadhl ibn 'Ali, is a man of 35, of sedentary habits, who has up to the present shown no marked ability. He is fairly well educated according to Arab standards, but knows no English. He is very popular with the tribe. He succeeded his cousin H, H, Sultan Sir 'Ali ibn Ahmed ibn 'Ali, K.C.I.E., on July 13, 1915, when the latter was accidentally shot during the Ottoman occupation of Lahej. The tribe owes its importance more to its wealth than to its military prowess. It is entirely settled and agricultural, with the exception of the Ahl Ban, who are chiefly pastoral but have arable land westwards in Abiyan near the Fadhli Sultanate. The popula tion is estimated at 14,500. The late Sultan of Lahej controlled the first stage of the main caravan road from Aden to Yemen up the Wadi Tiban, and main tained armed and fortified posts at Zeida, Sha'qah (Shaka), and 'Anad. He also had a customs post for the Aden traffic at Dar510 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH el-Amir. He was then able to put into the field about 2 000 men who were of doubtful fighting value but strong enough to rewl any tribal attacks, knowing that British troops would come t their aid in the event of serious trouble.

'Abd el-Wahid The 'Abd el-Wahid confederation lies immediately to the east of the Upper and Lower 'Aulaqi Sultanates, with whose tribesmen it is at constant feud. Tribally it is divided into the Sultanates of Balhaf, Habban, and Izzan. The Sultan of Balhaf, who lives in the town of that name on the sea-coast, is Salih ibn 'Abdullah, who used to be officially recog nized at Aden as the head of the 'Abd el-Wahid confederation, and who received a small subsidy from Government. He is well conducted, anglophile, but without much influence over his tur bulent tribesmen. The latter have an hereditary feud with the Ba Kazim, but lack their resolute grit and hardihood. Passage from one country to the other is dangerous, and supplies from Aden ordinarily come by sea. The Sultan of Habban, the chief mercantile town of the district, is Nasir ibn Salih. He is untrustworthy, and strongly opposed to any European penetration of his dominion. He is unpopular with his tribesmen and frequently has trouble with the Lakmush and Ahl Iswad, two small but turbulent vassal tribes who lie between him and his hereditary enemies, the Ahl Ma'an of Upper 'Aulaqi. The chief of the Izzan Sultanate, which lies 25 miles to the east of Habban, is Muhsin ibn Salih. He is a man of about 45, un popular with his tribes, a robber and a bad governor. He was expelled by the tribesmen in the early nineties, and after taking refuge with the Ahl Ma'an, went to Aden, Jibuti, and Hodeidah. Having tried in vain to raise money by pledging his Sultanate in turn to the French and the Turks, he returned San'a and managed to reinstate himself. In 1898 he again came into dis favour by endeavouring to blackmail the Austrian Expedition,2VT ADEN PROTECTORATE 511 He is now recognized by the Aden authorities as paramount and receives a subsidy of Rs, 720 per annum. He is also supreme at Balhaf, but shares the dues with Salih ibn 'Abdullah. Officially recognized Sultan, Muhsin ibn Salih of Izzan. Subsidiary Sultans : Nasir ibn Salih of Habban. Tribes ; Ahl Isivad, Lakmush, Salih ibn 'Abdullah of Balhaf. 3. AM Karab The Ahl Karab is a nomad tribe ranging the desolate tracts north of Upper 'Aulaqi and penetrating as far west as Beihan el- Jezab and the Musabein country. They are a tribe of marauders and robbers, and though nominally vassals of the Upper 'Aulaqi Sultan, are always at war with the Ahl Hammam. Their chief is Hamid ibn Nasir abu Kateyan, who lives at Shabwah, a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, some 55 miles north east of Nisab, built on the ruins of an ancient Himyarite city. They muster 400 men. 4. Ahles-Sa'ldi The Ahl es-Sa'idi are a small confederation bounded on the north by the 'Audillah, on the east by the Oleh, on the south by the Oleh, and on the west by the Yafa'. They are chiefly to be found near Dakhlah and the Sa'idi plain, and are the original owners of the soil under the tenure of the Sultan of Upper 'Aulaqi, whose influence extends as far as Qarn Murshid. A land-tax is due to him from them, and is always withheld until he comes down to fetch it with a large force. This happens about_every five years. The chief 'Aqil is Mohammed 'Ali abu 'Awad, who resides at Nubat es-Suwa, and also holds supreme authority over the Yazid, who pay taxes to him. The Confederation numbers about 300 men, and are the nucleus of the following sub-tribes : (1) Ahl Diyan. Living at El-'Ain and Hamra. Their 'Aqil Nasr Hamid, lives at El-'Ain and receives a small tax from them, but at Thuwarein they pay a far larger tax or to Mohammed ibn 'Ali, a chief of the Ahl es-Sa'idi, whose grandfather was formerly 'Aqil on condition of receiving 'ushr from the Ahl Diyan, which was levied on land which512 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH they tilled, belonging to the Ahl es-Sa'idi. The 'AqMin passed from that family, but the is still paid Th Ahl Diyan muster about 200 men and are an offshoot of the sub-tribe at Khaura, but may now be considered as a component part of the Ahl es-Sa'idi Confederacy. (2) Ahl Yazid. Living at Dakhlah. They muster about fiftv men. There are three more actual sub-divisions of the Ahl es-Sa'idi but they barely muster between them 100 men and are scattered throughout the neighbouring villages in a most confusing manner. There is a settlement within their territory called Hafa, whicli is peopled by Sadah (or Seyyids), whose origin is from Waht ('Abdali country), where is the shrine of a well-known saint, 'Aim abu 'Ali, who, it is stated, formed a friendship with 'Amr ak Sa'id (now enshrined at Mijdah) and was granted by him a small tax on the land round Dakhlah, which these Sadah collect. It is payable in kind, as are all these ecclesiastical contributions, and is about 5 per cent, on the year's crop. There is a shrine at Hafa (Fatimah bint Ahmed), and its attendants form the balance of the population. 5. A small and peaceably disposed tribe, numbering about 700 souls, ranging north of Aden lagoon and west of Bir Ahmed, the tribal capital. Here is the residence of the local Sultan, the tall mud tower of which can be plainly seen from Aden harbour. Tie inhabitants are agricultural and pastoral. Their chief is Sheikh Fadhl ibn 'Abdullah Ba Haidarah, who succeeded his father in 1905, He is now about 31 years old, and is said to be fairly intelligent. His uncle, 'Ali Ba Haidarah, a shrewd old man of nearly 70, un successfully pressed his claim to the Sheikhship in 1905, but later worked in harmony with the present chief. In the present war pressure from their powerful northern neigh bours, the Subeihi, and from the Turks has brought them in tem porarily on the side of the latter. Their Sultan is said to be a prisoner in Turkish hands. 6. A small tribe of 1,200 souls whose chief village is at Suleiq, about 55 miles north of Aden. They live just south of the Quteibi tribe, Sheikh 'Ali ibn Nashir ibn Sheif, who lives at Kasha', is the present chief. He has the tribe well in hand in spite of the chronic disputesADEN PROTECTORATE 513 with the Quteibi. A middle-aged man of no particular influence, he was at first loyal and amenable to advice, but for some years his hatred and jealousy of the Quteibi, combined with excessive indulgence in hat, led him into trouble. The animosity between him and the Quteibi finally cooled down and a permanent settle ment was effected between them in 1913 by the late 'Abdali Sultan, Sir Ahmed Fadhl. He succeeded to the Chief ship in 1898 and signed an agreement for the safety of the trade routes in July 1914, under which his stipend was raised from Rs. 600 to 1,200 per annum. Early in January 1916 he and his tribe were reported to have submitted with the Quteibi to the Turks and to be marching against the Fadhli Sultan. 7. Am The Amiri is a pastoral and agricultural tribe numbering 5,000 souls and occupying the country round and south-east of Dhala, their capital. The original Emirs of Dhala were Muwallads or half-caste slaves of the Imams of San'a. When the power of the latter was broken up, the Dhala district was in the hands of certain Seyyids, from whom it was seized by the forefathers of the present chief. There has been a long line of Emirs, and since the occupation of Aden by the British these chiefs have been in receipt of a subsidy, except during the period from 1873 to 1878, when the Ottoman Govern ment made a strong aggressive effort to place the district under their own control. By allegiance or conquest several additions have been made to what may be called the district of Dhala proper. These consist of Kharafah, Jebel Harir, the valley of the Suheibiyah as far south as Qaflah, the Dhubayyat hill (only nominal), Sufyan, and Zobeid. The population of the Amiri territory is of a mixed nature. Firstly, there are the descendants of the original Amirs, constituting a large clan, although, as at present, not always united; secondly, such Sheiri Sheikhs as are content to acknowledge the authority of the Emir ; thirdly, the various settlers who have from time to time become possessed of land which thej^ cultivate ; fourthly, the ever-present Seyyids or descendants of the Prophet; and, lastly, a colony of Jews. The Emir is Nasir ibn Sha'if ibn Seif, who lives at Dhala. He became Emir in 1911 and is the son of Sha'if ibn Seif 'Abd el-Hadi, who attended the Delhi Durbar during the Boundary Commission of 1902. He is a man of 36, good-natured, but weak and avaricious ARABIA I K k514 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH and of little ability. He has two brothers, 'Abd el-Hamid and Seif the latter of whom is said to possess a considerable amount of energy and character. The ruling house is unpopular with the tribesmen. When the Turks appeared in 1915 they took from him some fifteen hostages and deprived him of his position. Towards the end of the year they summoned him to Lahej and made a settle ment by which they released the hostages, keeping his son in their stead, and reinstated him with the gift of 50 rifles and a subsidy It is doubtless owing to this that the neighbouring tribes of Quteibi and 'Alawi were coerced into joining them. Sheikh Qasim of Zobeid, who accompanied him to Lahej, received a gift of 10 rifles. Emir, Nasir ibn Sha'if ibn Seif ; 'Abd el-Hamid ibn Sha'if ibn Seif, Seif ibn Sha'if ibn Seif. Suh-Tribes.

'Audillah The 'Audillah is a predatory tribe mustering 5,000 fighting men (including l asdlcir) and inhabiting the Kaur, the main ridge of the Aden Hinterland. It is bounded on the north by the Beida Sul tanate, on the south by the Oleh confederation of Dathinah, on the east by the 'Aulaqi, and on the west by the Yafa'. The tribesmen are mainly pastoral, but cultivate barely sufficient for theiri2s*f ADEN PROTECTORATE 515 They hold a weekly market at Laudar, near the south foot of the Khaur, which the neighbouring tribes attend under a mutual understanding of neutrality. Here lives their Sultan, Qasim ibn Hamid el-Ghabir, a man who is powerless to curb their freebooting tendencies, but who provides the only ready channel by which the tribe can be approached. He made overtures for treaty rela tions in 1902, but was not at the time considered of sufficient impor tance for these to be encouraged. In 1912 he renewed his request, and as it was confirmed that the Turks had been making advances to him, a protectorate treaty was concluded in September 1914. The tribe has remained loyal during the present war. The only man who exercises any influence is Mohammed ibn Mohammed 'Abdullah, 'Aqil of the Kaur, a powerful chief whom, owing to the natural strength of his fortress, it is almost impossible to reach or constrain.

Upper l Aulaqi The 'Aulaqi country is inhabited by a large tribal confederation, divided for political purposes into the Sultanates of Upper and Lower 'Aulaqi, but maintaining close intertribal relations and uniting in the event of any aggression from outside. It extends from the edge of the Ruba' el-Khali to the Aden Gulf, and is bounded on the east by the 'Abd el-Wahid Sultanate and on the west by the Sultanates of Beida, 'Audillah, Oleh, Yafa', and Fadhli. The inhabitants are mainly pastoral and semi-nomadic, but there are large tracts of arable land, while the main wadis all have their settled population. The history of the confederation is as follows: From the Prophet's epoch (or still earlier), the Nisab Sultanate was in the hands of the Umm-Rusas dynasty of Beida, while the whole of Wadi Yeshbum (then called Wadi Kahai) was under the Sultanate of 'Abd el-Wahid, whose capital was then at Habban. Wadi Yesh- bum seems to have then been inhabited chiefly by who paid taxes to the 'Abd el-Wahid dynasty. The Ba Kazim were then confined to Heid Herif (a part of the Utheili system), while Ahwar and district was in the hands of a tribe called the Ahl Zeidi. Soon after the Prophet's death considerable political dissension seems to have occurred in the land of Jauf, where dwelt the rem nants of the ancient and powerful Minean dynasty, which flounshea before the Sabean kingdom, owing to the death of the paramoun chief, named Ma'an. The house of Ma'an was much persecutedADEN PROTECTORATE 617 and fled the country, together with two branches of a former ruling chief named Salih, whose descent was as follows : SALIH. These three clans, the Ahl 'Abdullah, Ahl 'Ah, and the Ah! Ma'an, wandered across the outskirts of the Great Desert until they came upon Wadi Yeshbum, where they settled side by side with the my a of 'Abd el-Wahid on the spot where now stand Wasitah and Sa'id. They had, of course, to become them selves, as they were aliens under the protection of another Sultanate, and for many years they paid tribute to the Sultan of Habban. In the course of time, however, they increased enormously in numbers, and the Ahl Ma'an left the wadi and adopted a pastoral and semi-nomadic life in the mountains, leaving the two branches of Manasir Bu Salih still settled in the Yeshbum Valley. About the middle of the sixteenth century these latter became very dis contented with their lot owing to excessive taxation, and in a.d . 1590 they persuaded the Ahl Ma'an to join them in an attack on the Umm-Rusas dynasty at Nisab, with a view to the annexation of the whole of that district. The Ahl Bunyar, who now inhabit the plateau of Dahr but then occupied the Nisab district as well, fought desperately for their Sultan, but could not stand before the rush of the Ahl Ma'an, who were fighting for their very existence as a tribe. The then representative of the Umm-Rusas dynasty at Nisab fled for his life, and the Ahl Bunyar were chased up Wadi Khaura with great slaughter. The Ahl 'Abdullah received the Sultanate, and from them the present Sultan is descended. Many of the Ahl Ma'an settled in this new Sultanate, as will be shown later on when considering the distribution of the various sub-tribes. The remainder returned to their pastoral life near Wadi Yeshbum, the Ahl 'Ali going back to their settlements in the wadi. The Ba Kazim now realized that this alien race was becoming a formidable power, and, having also views of expansion, sent a deputation to the Ahl 'Ali asking for their assistance in wresting Nas. A son (killed in Jauf). Farid. 'Ali 'Abdullah.518 SETTLED TRIBES OE THE SOUTH Ahwar from the Zeidi, offering them the Sultanate of that district. A famous diplomat and ascetic, Sheikh Abeid, whose name is still revered in both Upper and Lower Aulaqi, arranged the treaty between the two parties. It was agreed that the Ba Kazim should have three-quarters of the arable land at Ahwar and the Ahl 'Ali the other quarter, the latter receiving the Sultanate. In the attack on Ahwar the Zeidi were completely defeated. Some tendered their submission, and are there to this day as mere tributary and the rest fled towards the north-west, and no trace of them remains, although it is said that a small colony of them are settled at Jauf, The Ba Kazim then spread all over the country now known as Lower 'Aulaqi, but never seem to have submitted to the suzerainty of their nominal Sultan, whose dynasty they regarded as aliens whom they themselves had pitchforked into power. After the Ahl 'All had left Yeshbum, one of the two divisions of the Ahl Ma'an abandoned their pastoral life and settled in the wadi. This was the Ahl 'Ali Bu Hamid, the other division, the Ahl Mohammed Bu Hamid, still following their nomadic, life in the mountains. The Upper 'Aulaqi Sultan is Salih ibn 'Abdullah, who lives at Medaq, a short distance from Nisab. He is a man of about 55, energetic and with considerable influence oyer the tribes. He was a signatory by proxy of the Aden Treaty in 1904, and has main tained his Anglophile attitude during the present war by refusing to join the Turks in their attack on Aden. His descent is as follows; (AHL 'ABDULLAH) 'Awad Abu 'Abdullah (the last Sultan who visited Aden). f T ^ i 1 Hamid. 'Abdullah. Sakkaf. Umm Eusas. Salih ibn 'Abdullah. His tribesmen are inclined to be predatory, and although he does not give his official sanction to their raids, he nevertheless connives at them and generally receives some of the plunder in an unos en tatious manner. At the same time he keeps a firm control ove his subjects, and only permits measures to be taken against tur lent and aggressive tribes whom it is necessary to punish. 'Audillah are always blockading the roads through his country, ani, . g) ADEN PROTECTORATE 619 the Ahl Deman have an evil reputation for acts of violence and oppression perpetrated on petty traders. The Elhin and the Ahl Diyan are similar offenders. The ethics of such measures are, of course, doubtful^ but it can at least be said that many tribes and sub-tribes abstain from predatory acts, deterred by the fear of bringing wholesale ruin and disaster on themselves and their fellow tribesmen. The two chief tribes are the Ahl Ma'an and the Ahl Mehajir. The Ahl Ma'an, with the exception of a large detached section, the Ba Thuban near Wadi Khaura, east of Nisab, inhabit the fer tile valley of Yeshbum and its surrounding hills. They are noted for their bravery and fighting qualities, and can muster about 5,000 fighting men. Their ruling family is the Earid ; its present representative Muhsin ibn Earid. He is a man of about 45, and has always been Anglophile. He signed the Aden Treaty in 1903, and was granted a stipend of Rs. 1,440 per annum. He succeeded his elder brother Erwes, who was deposed by the tribes in about 1895 for intriguing with the then Sultan of Habban, Muhsin ibn Salih, and committing them to the sack of Habban, a venture which they refused to undertake. His family is as follows : (AHL MA'AN) N ase I • I I Umm Dheb Abu Bekr Farid. (killed at Seilan). (killed at Lahej). ih. Umm Moham- Abu Muh- 'AbduJ- Rusas. med. Bekr. sin lah. (present 'Aqil).

They can raise about 4,000 fighting men, but their strength is not concentrated like that of the Ahl Ma'an. They lead a more nomadic life, and range the country from the northern boundary of the 'Audillah and the Kaur el-'Aud to the desert stretches north of the Nisab and the wild country of the Ahl Karab and the Musabein, who pay a nominal allegiance to the Sultan of Upper 'Aulaqi, but are ever swift to raid his tribesmen when an opportunity occurs. The most northern section of the Mehajir, the Ahl Hammam,520 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH are themselves inclined to be predatory, and scour the Hammarn Desert on the look-out for caravans. When the depredations become too frequent and obtrusive, the Sultan of Nisab marches his troops into their country and quickly restores order, dealing out condign punishment on any raiding parties met with. The Hammam 'Aqil, Husein abu Ahmed, has not much control over his people and-cannot check marauding. In addition to his own tribesmen, the Sultan exercises suzerainty over the following : 1. The Bal Harith, who pay immediate allegiance to the Sherif of Beihan, who in turn is under Nisab influence and pays a private, semi-voluntary tribute. 2. The Musabein, merely nominal. 3. The Ahl Karab, also nominal. 4. The Ahl es-Sa'idi, who pay him land tax under pressure, A further description of the above will be found under their names, 5. The Ahl Nasiyin, who derive their origin from the almost extinct race of Beni Hilal, a few surviving representatives of which may be found 'at Heid Hadhinah. They number 700 men, and their territory stretches from Hajar to Heid Jehur and towards the south-east. Its limit occurs at Jaul (or Jal) Heirur, and maj be said to lie along the Wadi Markhah within the limits named, The Sultan is Nasr abu Thalib, who belongs to the Abu Thalib dynasty, an offshoot of the Nisab dynasty. His sway is, of course, subject to the jurisdiction of Nisab. 6. Three clans who are termed 'Asakir.

Ahl Ba Hadah, another treaty tribe of the Ahl Ma'an, who number 300 men and extend from below the Nakabah gorge to within a short distance of Habban. 9. Khalifah, a treaty tribe living on the western slopes of Heid Hadhinah, a range to the west of the Hammam Desert, and muster ing about 1,000 men. The fighting strength of the Sultan, including his 'Asakir or standing army, is as follows ; Troops at Medak, Nisab, Wadi Dhura, Wadi Abadan (or Abdan), Wasat, and Beihan ..... 1,100 Ahl Ma'an and Treaty Tribes 4,900 Ahl Mehajir and Nasayln . . . • . 4,400 10,400 In case of a great emergency the Sultan would, as suzerain, secure the services of the desert tribes lying east and north-east of the Hammam as far as human life can be supported in the desert. The Beihan tribes would join as a matter of policy, for they are too close to escape being crushed by the fall of the 'Aulaqi dynasty. The people of Jauf would certainly throw in their lot with the 'Aulaqi, for it has always been the policy of the Nisab Sultans to keep in touch with the parent tribeship, and Jaufi chiefs are often entertained at Nisab. The Khalifah of Hadhinah would also come forward, as a serious reverse to Upper 'Aulaqi would cut them off from all their trade routes to Nisab, Yeshbum, and Habban. Lower 'Aulaqi would follow the lead of the Ahl Ma'an, as between Umm Rusas abu Farid and 'Ali abu Muhsin, the paramount chief of the Ba Kazim, there is firm friendship and also a defensive treaty. Only in the case of aggression against the 'Abdali Sultan would the Ba Kazim keep out, there being a close alliance between 'Ali abu Muhsin and the 'Abdali Sultan. If the position of Dathinah is considered, it will be seen that the Oleh confederacy must join in or be annihilated, and, besides, their sympathies are with the 'Aulaqi. Under such circumstances the forces may be estimated as follows : Upper 'Aulaqi . 10,400 Lower 'Aulaqi . . . • _ • • • • 4,800 Jauf and tribes between them and Beihan . . . 12,000 Beihan ....••••• 6,000 Desert tribes, Ahl Karab, &amp;c. ..... 8,000 Khalifah of Hadhinah 1,000 Oleh of Dathinah ....... 3,200 45,400522 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH The Ahl Bunyar, who number about 4,000, are excluded as they would follow the Beida Sultan, and some tribes, whose forces are not known, are also omitted. The supply of breech-loading rifles amongst these tribes has increased enormously during the last few years, and they have some good mounted troops. Their military spirit is undeniable their history for the last century being full of martial episodes. The Ba Kazim with its numerous subdivisions compose the entire tribal population of Lower 'Aulaqi, and can put into the field about 5,000 men. They are a hardy and turbulent race, always engaged in petty feuds amongst themselves, or raids on their immediate neighbours, the 'Abd el-Wahid, Fadhli, and Oleh They have a bad reputation with the other tribes on account of their fondness for drink and their slackness in religious observances, but are redeemed by their genuineness and bravery. They have no paramount chief, such influence as the tribe will into permit being exercised by the brother chiefs of the Ahl 'Ali section at Ghidabah, Fadhl and 'All Muhsin. The late Sultan of Lower 'Aulaqi, Bu Bckr ibn Nasir, lived at Ahwar, about five miles from the coast, and had very little influ ence over the Ba Kazim tribesmen.

Bei Beihan is the name given to the district adjoining Wadi Beihan from the point where it leaves the mountain system of Beida down to the region where it loses itself in the Great Desert. Commencing from the upper reaches, the land on both sides of the wadi is in the hands of the Beida Sultanate. Farther down are the limits of the Musabein, chief town Hajarah. Below them the Sultan of Nisab has some land, and farther down are the tribal limits of the Bal Harith, in which are the towns 'of Durb, Hakaba, and Seilan ; the two latter belong to the Ashraf of Beihan and Durb belongs to a large and influential family of Sadah. The above towns have also a large population of raya, or trading classes, all of whom pay taxes to the Sultan of Upper 'Aulaqi. The Ashraf and Sadah also pay a private semi-voluntary tribute (Jibar) to him, and he ARABIA I L 1530 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH exercises considerable influence in the district.

The chief Emir at Beihan is Ahmed ibn Muhsin of Hakaba, who also resides at Beihan el-Jezab. He is an old man of about 67, crafty, but less powerful than he pretends. He is comparatively wealthy, entertains lavishly, and is very popular with the Bal Harith, among whom he lives for a great part of the year as a Bedouin, in the lower reaches of Wadi Beihan. He acts as an arbitrator and dispenses justice. As regards his outside relations, he is on bad terms with the Sherif of Mareb, He has always been anglophile and signed the Aden Treaty in 1903. More recently he has expressed anxiety to extend the British sphere of influence northwards over Beida, Mareb, and Jauf. The Sheikh of the Bal Harith is Shammakh ibn Ghannam, a middle-aged man who visited Aden in 1904 and confirmed the treaty concluded with Ahmed ibn Muhsin in the preceding year. Neither he nor any of the Ashraf have any influence with the Musabein. The Bal Harith, Sadah, and Ashraf number together 2,000 men. The Musabein are said to muster more than 4,000 men. The sand-dunes which surround Beihan on three sides prevent anything in the nature of a cavalry dash for raiding purposes, but marauding parties (especially from the Hammam), frequently slip through on saddle-camels and play havoc with the Musabein.

Dhdmhari A small tribe north of Aden, about 40 miles east of the Haushabi, whose Sultan claims suzerainty over them, a claim which they only admit when it suits them. They have always given trouble, and in 1903 a British column meted out punishment to them for raiding the mail, and destroyed their fortress at Nakhlein. The chief Sheikh is Salim Husein. They are reported to have recently Joined the Turks. 14. Fad The Fadhli are a large and warlike tribe, numbering about 8,000 fighting men, who are probably well armed owing to their large seaboard and resources. They are pastoral and agricultural, and extend from Maqatin (the Lower 'Aulaqi boundary) to the Eadhli border and British frontier line at Tmad, where the tribeship is a mere coastal strip and uninhabited. To the north is the Oleh confederation, over whom the Sultan claims a suzerainty, which is not admitted. In actual practice his power does not extend inland of the maritime ranges. The Sultan is Husein ibn Ahmed, resident at Shiighrah (Shuqrah). He is an old man of 90, and in 1877 was deported to India and confined in the fort of Ahmed- nagar for 9 years, having been implicated in the murder of his brother Heidiyah, who was then Sultan. Heidiyah was succeeded by Sultan Husein's son, Ahmed ibn Husein. The latter died in 1907, after giving much trouble to the authorities, and Husein was proclaimed Sultan. He is unpopular with his subjects, and his grandson 'Abdullah Din ibn Ahmed has greater influence and is anxious to supplant him. He has a son aged 31 named 'Abdullah ibn Husein, who acted for him during his absence in Delhi at the Durbar in 1911, and again in 1913 when he visited Jerusalem. Sultan Husein visited Aden late in 1916, afterwards returning to Shughrah. In January of this year he was summoned to Lahej and received by Sa'ud Pasha with much honour. After remaining there for some time he returned to Shughrah and reopened corre spondence with Aden, claiming to have been compelled by majeure to visit Lahej. His subsidy has been withheld and an embargo been placed on Shughrah. He has been ordered to Aden to state his case, but it is not expected that he will comply until the situation is clearer. The Fadhli Sultan is in a favourable position, owing to the con vergence of several caravan routes from the northern and eastern districts, to collect onerous transit dues and hamper traffic generally.

They claim suzerainty over the Dhambari, which that tribe admits only when it suits them. They are agricultural and pastoral and number about 6,000 souls. The capital is Musemir, a town 60 miles north of Aden, situated on a small plateau overlooking the left bank of the Wadi Tiban. The Sultan, ' Ali ibn Mani, threw in his lot with the Turks when they appeared in 1915, and accompanied them south in their attack on Aden. He is said to be under the influence of Mohammed Nasir Muqbil of Mawiyah. He had always shown signs of weakness and irresolution, and although his conduct improved just before the war broke out he had the misfortune to be in the hands of ill-disposed and irresponsible advisers, of whom the chief is Fadl ibn 'All Humadi. 16. Haj The Sheikh of this district is Ahmed Na'man, formerly a tax- farmer and made a Kaimmakam by the Turks. He maintains a Zeidist levy of 500 men, and raised a larger force to help the Turkish expedition against Aden. Sub-Sheikhs under his influence attacked us at Sheikh Sa'id late in 1914. Early in 1915 he attacked Sh. Mohammed Hasan, the chief of a religious fraternity at Jebel Habashi, near Ta'izz, for refusal to pay tithe. More lately he has been reported to have been killed and succeeded by his son Moham med, who was formerly A.D.C. to the commandant of Ta'izz, and is said to be energetic and anti-British.ADEN PROTECTORATE 533 17. Qut A small tribe, about 50 miles north of Aden, whose head-quarters are at Dhi Hajarah. The Sultan of the Amiri, who rules imme diately to the north, claims suzerainty over them, but cannot enforce it, nor do they admit the claim. The tribe rebelled in 1903 and a British expedition was sent against them. Their Sheikh, Mohammed Salih el-Akhram, nursed a grievance about this for some years, but was eventually won over. He has not much influence over a restless and quarrelsome tribe. He was at odds with the 'Alawi until 1912, when the 'Abdali Sultan effected a reconciliation. The real power lies with his nephew, Sheikh Muqbil 'Abdullah, who has always been an unre liable factor. Sheikh Mohammed Salih endeavoured to remain neutral when the Turks advanced in 1915, and as late as November in that year wrote to the Resident, Aden, saying that the Turks were exercising pressure on him, and that he was afraid of invasion. He was still holding out in March 1916, but his nephew had been to Lahej to treat and temporize with the Turks. 18. Mdwlyah The Sheikh of Mawiyah, Qa'tabah, and Shurman is Mohammed Nasir Muqbil, a powerful chief on the Yemen boundary, whose influence extends from Qa'tabah to Sheikh Sa'id on the west, and south-east to the Haushabi country. He was originally a tax- farmer, whom the Turks made Kaimmakam of Shurman and Kama Ira. He opposed us in 1901 and, after an initial success against the Haushabi, was defeated by a British column which blew up his fortified tower at Darajah. On our protest to the Ottoman Government he was officially degraded as scapegoat, but was promoted later. In February 1915 he signed an agreement with the Resident, Aden, agreeing in return for a subsidy to expel the Turks and recalcitrant chiefs' from the Liwa of Ta'izz. Subsequently he joined the Turkish advance, bringing with him his permanent levy of 500 Feidis and some fighting men from the neighbouring tribes. Latterly he has been reported as being at Lahej with the Haushabi. 19. Musa A wild, semi-nomad tribe between the country of the Sherif of Beihan, who has no influence over them, and the Bal Harith tribe. Their head-quarters are at Hajarah and they range east to the Ahl Karab country. They are nominally vassals of the Upper534 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH 'Aulaqi tribe, but are on bad terms with the Ahl Hammam, who frequently send small raiding parties against them through the difficult sand-dune country which surrounds them. They are Scaid to have 4,000 men. The Oleh are a powerful confederation of tribes, descended from a chief of that name, in a district known as Dathinah, which, however, only occupies the centre of the confederation. Its limits are rather vague. The boundaries of the confederation are, on the north Upper 'Aulaqi, on the south the Merqushi (Markashi) section of the Eadhli Confederation, on the east Lower 'Aulaqi, and on the west and north-west the 'Audillah, with whom they have an here ditary feud. They number about 3,000 fighting men of good material, but undisciplined and lacking cohesion. They have no paramount chief, but Sheikh 'Ali ibn 'Alawi of the Elhin, who claims descent from the common ancestor, Oleh, influences tribal policy to a certain extent. He has the right to adjust disputes between any tribes of the confederation. There are three main family divisions of the Oleh, their family names being at the present time merely abstract titles denoting the branch from which each tribe was originally descended. They are the Ahl Ba Leil, the Ahl Annan, and the Ahl Sa'id. The Ahl Ba Leil are the most numerous division, mustering nearly 1,500 fighting men. They occupy the south-eastern portion of the con federation and have a bad name for raiding caravans, although such acts are by no means common. Their 'Aqil is 'Awad ibn Haidarah of the Ahl Hanash. They are all nomadic and pastoral, but own a few fortified villages and possess a little arable land. The Ahl Arman number 700 men and are mountaineers, pastoral and semi-nomadic. The Ahl Sa'id dwell in the plain of 'Amudiyah and are the richest and most civilized portion of the confederation. They are agricultural, settled and trading. Ahl Ba Leil.

True ' Children of the Dawnas their name by some is said to imply, they by preference select that hour for their attacks on wayfarers. They are divided into a large number of petty clans, and there is no paramount chief. Except for some arable land near Umm Rija, they pay little atten tion to agriculture, nor do they engage in commerce to any extent. Many members of the tribe, however, earn a livelihood by becoming muqaddams, or leaders, of caravans from other districts which pass through the Subeihi country for Aden. On account of their frugal diet, which consists of little else than they are very spare in frame, but possess great powers of endurance and have a high reputation for courage, unfortunately blemished by their character for treachery.

They were placed under the sovereignty of the 'Abdali in 1881, but overthrew his control and resumed their old position of inde pendent relations with the Residency in 1886. Agreements were made with the Dubeini, Mansuri, Makhdumi, and Rujei subdivisions of the tribe, whereby, in consideration of a monthly allowance, the traffic passing through their districts was freed from transit dues and protection granted to travellers.

Upper Ydfa' The Confederation of Upper Yafa c is situated to the NE. of Aden, and is bounded by the Lower Yafa 4 Sultanate on the south, the Beida and 'Audillah on the east, and the Amiri and Dhambari on the west. The inhabitants are warlike and hardy mountaineers, always ready for active service, which they seek in different parts of the world. As a confederation they lose power owing to the lack ofADEN PROTECTORATE 539 cohesion and a uniform policy and the personal ambition of the different Sultans. Like many other tribes in the south of Arabia, they were formerly subject to the Imams of San'a. The tribe is called after their ancestor ' 'Afif Although known as ' Upper Yafa' ' in English, the confederation is called in Arabic Yafa' es-Sufla, or ' Lower Yafa' The rightful Sultan of Upper Yafa' is 'Omar Qahtan, who suc ceeded his father in 1913, but was expelled by the tribe for coming to Aden to make a treaty with us, as they were jealous of his selec tion. He belongs to the Dhubi section, though originally of the house of Sheikh 'Ali Harharah. He was opposed by his brother, Salih ibn 'Omar, and, despite English influence, failed to get himself reinstated. The Government accordingly refused to recognize him as Sultan and gave him a year within which to bring about his rehabilitation. They, however, continued to pay the stipend received by his father, Qahtan, who was a man of little influence and in his later days an exile from his capital. His brother Salih ibn 'Omar, who is a man of much stronger character, was recognized in 1911 by the Maflahis as their Sultan and receives tribute from Rub'atein. There are four chief tribes : the Mausata, Maflahi, Sheibi, and Dhubi. The Sheikh of the Mausata is Muhsin 'Askar. He is a man about 75 years old and comes of a family of intriguers, but wields undoubted influence. He signed the treaty with the Bombay Government in 1904 as joint signatory with his brother 'Ali 'Askar. The latter died in 1907 and was succeeded by his son Naji 'Ali 'Askar, but most of the power has remained with his uncle Muhsin 'Askar. The Sheibi are the most northerly tribe of the Confederation and impinge on Ottoman territory towards the Bana. Their Sultan is 'Ali Mauna es-Sakladi. The Sheikh of the Dhubi is Salim Salih ibn 'Atif Jabir. He is a stipendiary and his predecessor was the first Upper Yafa' Sheikh to conclude a treaty with us (1903). Two other stipendiaries of this section are the brother Sheikhs Mohammed and 'Omar ibn Muthanna ibn 'Atif Jabir. The latter has little influence and has not justified his selection as stipendiary. He is grasping and a master of intrigue. Rub'atein is an appanage of the Dhubi tribe. The three principal Sheikhs are Yahya ibn 'Askar, Salih ibn Ahmed, and Yahya Nasir. Before the war they were all fearful of Turkish intrigue and desired closer relations with the British Government. Another important tribe is that of the Maflahi, whose chief is540 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH 'Abd er-Rahman ibn Qasim. He is a stipendiary and has always been a well-wisher of the English. His residence is at Jurba* The conduct of the Upper Yafa' Sheikhs has not been entirely satisfactory lately. Some of the non-stipendiary Sheikhs have lone resented their exclusion from the list of recipients of doles and have turned to the Imam of San'a. The descent of the Turkish forces opened an avenue for securing loot and monetary consideration from Sa'id Pasha. The stipendiaries have been outwardly loyal, but there is evidence to show that some sort of secret understanding exists between them and the transborder Arabs. A section of the Mausata have actually gone over to the enemy, and the rest will follow where they think that their interest leads them. UPPER YAFA' CONFEDERATION Tribe.

They can muster from 8,000 to 10,000 men under Thabit ibn 'Omar, their Paramount Chief.542 SETTLED TRIBES OE THE SOUTH 7. Ham A strong and warlike nomad tribe descended from Himyar in the country north of Makalla. They are entirely independent, can put nearly 10,000 men in the field, and are always at war with the Sultan of Makalla, the Awabthah, and the Seiban. Their chief Sheikh is Sheikh Halreish.

K The Kathiri tribe is one of the most warlike and powerful tribes in the Hadhramaut and is the chief menace to the ever-increasing power of the Sultan of Makalla. They are partly settled and partly nomad, and occupy the country between Terim and Seyyun, their chief towns, almost up to the Sultan of Makalla's frontier city of Shibam. The feud between the two arose in the early seventies of last century and has ever since dominated the politics of the Hadhramaut. At that time the Kathiri Sultan of Seyyun borrowed three lakhs of rupees from the head of the Ka'aiti family, and after wards repudiated the debt. Recourse was had to the Political Resident of Aden, and after arbitration had proved abortive, Shiheir and Makalla, then in the possession of the Kathiri Sultan, were bombarded by a British ship and handed over to the Ka'aiti. SinceHADHRAMAUT 543 Bjat nUf fc 111 fSli then there has been an increasing fend which has at times led to actual warfare. The present Kathiri Sultan is Mansur Kathiri, a man who has been unable to enforce his will on his independent tribesmen; the latter are said to number 10,000 to 15,000 fighting men, and with their allies the 'Awamir, Tamimi, and Jabiri, who can put into the field another 5,000 warriors, they form a very powerful con federation. Like all tribal confederations, however, jealousies and an innate independence prevent them from making full use of their power. 12. Mandhil A warlike and independent nomad tribe, roaming the country to the north of the Hamumi, numbering between 5,000 and 6,000 men. They are allied to the Hamumi in opposition both to the Seiban and the Sultan of Makalla. 13. Mohammedin A small nomad tribe, numbering 300 men, between the Nu'a on the west and the Beni Hasan on the east. They trace their descent to Himyar. Sa'id ibn Suleiman is their Sheikh, living at Haseisah, the main tribal centre. 14. Nah The Nahad areaBedouin tribe, descended from Kindah, numbering from 3,000 to 4,000 men and occupying the country due north of Haurah. They are on friendly terms with the Sultan of Makalla's representative at Haurah, but are bitter enemies of the powerful tribe of Sa'ar to their north. Their Paramount Chief is Sheikh Ibn Minif. 15. Nu The Nu'a are a Bedouin tribe, descended from Himyar, with head-quarters round the valley of Wadi el-Hajar. They are bounded on the west by the tribes of the 'Abd el-Wahid Sultanate, on the north-west by the Deiu and A1 Hamim tribes, on the north by the Numan, and on the east by the Seiban and Mohammedin. Between Bir 'Ali and Haseisah they come down to the sea. They cultivate dhura and wheat in Wadi Hajar and raise dates, but their chief wealth is in camels, of which they are said to possess about 6,000, and in sheep and goats. The Sultan of Makalla cast covetous eyes on their possessions and for 12 years strove to wrest the Wadi Hajar from them. He met with no success, and two years ago relinquished his attempts and made peace. The Nu'a can put544 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH from 5,000 to 6,000 men in the field, all armed with rifles. Their chief Sheikh is Ahmed ihn Qadim, who lives at Luhnah, a man of about 45, strong and well liked by his tribes. He keeps on good terms with the Sultan of Balhaf and with the Dein, and is allied with Thabit ibn 'Omar, the chief of the A1 Hamim, who helped him in his war against the Sultan of Makalla. The Ashraf are strong in the district, and Sherif el-Beit of Kanini is much sought after as an arbitrator in quarrels between the different clans. Paramount Sheikh : Ahmed ibn Qadim. Sub-Tribes.

Their chief Sheikh is Salih ibn Selim ibn Qutam. 17. The Sa'ar are probably the most numerous tribe in the Hadhra- maut; but though completely independent and lawless, they are too far removed to play a very important part in its politics. They roam the country north of the Nahad and Haurah right up to the edge of the Ruba' el-Khali and are said to number 20,000 men. An old feud exists between them and the Nahad. Their chief is Ibn Jarbu. Thev claim descent from Kindah. 18. S AHimyarite tribe of nomads inhabiting the desolate plateau to the west of the upper reaches of the Wadi el-'Aisar. They are bounded on the north by the 'Amudi, on the south by the Abaharan and Beni Hasan, and on the east by the Hamumi. 'Omar ibn Ahmed is their chief Sheikh, but they come also under the suzerainty of the Sultan of Makalla. They are friendly with the Nu'a and the small tribes on their south. With the Hamumi they have a long-standing feud which leads to continual fighting.HADHRAMAUT 545 They put about 2,000 men in the field. Abd er-Rahman esh-Shatri has great influence over them. Paramount Sheikh : 'Omar ibn Ahmed. A nomad tribe to the east of Terim and the Kathiri, with whom they are allied for purposes of defence. The Yafa' tribe, whose real home is in the Sultanates of Upper and Lower Yafa' to the north-east of Aden, are represented in the Hadhramaut by the influential and wealthy family of Ka'aiti. Some six generations ago the Seyyids of the Abu Bekr family, at that time the most powerful in the Hadhramaut, were seriously threatened by the Bedouin tribes, and in their extremity invited the assistance of the Yafa' Sultan. The Ka'aiti were sent to the rescue, and, having repulsed the enemy, established themselves in the country, where they have been ever since. Their power has steadily grown and was notably increased in 1874 by the expulsion of the Kathiri Sultan from Makalla and Shiheir and the presentation of these two towns to them by the British Government in settlement of a debt which had been repudiated by the Kathiri. They now own Makalla, Shiheir, Shibam, Haurah, and Hajarein, and exercise a suzerainty, which at times is only nominal, over the tribes of 'Amudi, Seiban, and Nahad. Their wealth comes chiefly from the Straits Settlements, whither many Hadhramis migrate, leaving their own sterile country to seek their fortunes abroad. Their connexion with Haidarabad is also very close, the Nizam maintaining a Hadhrami bodyguard, which is always commanded by one of the Ka'aiti family. The present head of the house, styled Sultan of Makalla, is Ghalib ibn 'Awad el-Ka'aiti, a man of fifty, who is anglophile and main tains close relations with Aden. He keeps a permanent bodyguard of 1,000 men, but frequently has recourse to hiring mercenaries both to maintain himself against his implacable enemies the Kathiri and their allies, and the Hamumi, and also in furtherance of his ARABIA I M m Sub-Tribes* B asarah.

They cultivate dates and corn and are generally a well -behaved and peaceable tribe. They are the real masters of Awabi, but Bahlah is their tribal capital and Hamra their largest separate village. 4. Beni'Adi (sing. A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering about 5,000 souls; Hinawi in politics, settled chiefly in Western Hajar at the villages of Sawalih, Murbah, Qasra, Ghashab, and Wabil in Wadi Fara, but also found on the coast at Quryat and at Ghuweisah in the sub-vilayet of Saham. Those at Ghashab belong to a section called Beni Bakr. 5. 'Ajam, or Persians (sing.

Their tribal capital is Yanqul. They are a leading Hinawi tribe who have generally supported the present ruling family of Muscat. They grow grain and dates. 8. Beni Bu'Ali (sing. The principal Ghafiri tribe of the Ja'lan and Sharqiyah districts in the Sultanate of Oman. They are partly nomadic and partly settled : the Bedouin portion inhabit Ja'lan and possess consider able herds of camels and goats, while the settled portion cultivate dates and corn in the Beled Beni Bu 'Ali oasis, and are found also at Sur and at Ras er-Ruweis, Suweih, Khor Beni Bu 'Ali, Jumeilah, and Lashkarah, on the SE. coast of Oman, where they are mostly mariners and fishermen. A few occur at Khabbah in Wadi Khabbah. Some authorities connect the Beni Bu 'Ali with the Al 'Ali of Trucial Oman and the Shibkuh district of Persia. They number in all about 7,000 souls, of whom 1,000 are Bedouins. They became Wahabites at the time of the Nejdi invasions of Oman about a century ago, and as late as 1845 were strict if not fanatical in the observance of Wahabite principles. They have since relaxed somewhat and now smoke tobacco, but they continue to be exact in the forms and times of prayer and are accounted the most religious tribe in the Oman Sultanate. They belong to a Wahabite sect known as Azraqah. They are on the average men of middle size with short features and quick, deep-set eyes; gloomy and determined in expression and M m 2548 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH character ; warlike and independent, with a high reputation for courage and dash. Their favourite weapon was originally a thin, straight, two-edged sword, sharp as a razor and attached by a leather thong to a shield 14 inches in diameter, in addition to which they carried matchlocks; their armament is now more modern, but they still have few breech loaders (1905). They are the only tribe of the Sultanate who have met a British force on land. On November 9,1820, they defeated a force of British Indian Sepoys at Beled Beni Bu c Ali, and on March 2, 1821, suffered severe retribution near the same place. On the latter occasion the tribe lost heavily in killed and wounded, the town and fort were destroyed, and a large number of prisoners were taken, including the principal Sheikh, Mohammed ibn c Ali; but the date-groves were spared—an act of clemency that was much appreciated and is still remembered. The prisoners, after being kept for two years at Bombay, were repatriated and received grants of money from the Indian Government to enable them to rebuild their houses and restore irrigation. Since this episode the tribe have uniformly shown themselves well disposed to the British and have treated hospitably more than one British traveller, but they have never fully regained their position in tribal politics. They have a chronic feud with their neighbours the Beni Bu Hasan. The following are the chief sections, &amp;c., of the tribe : Section.

Beni 'Ardbah (sing. 'Ardbi) A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 1,000 souls, of unascer tained politics and religion, found chiefly in Wadi Tayin at Sibal, Qurr, Hammam, and Shat. They are said to have been a large tribe once, but cholera killed off a great number. They have been at feud with the Siyabiyin for many years, but relations are less strained now. The singular form 'Arabi is avoided because it means a hill donkey. 11. Beni'Auf (sing. 'Aufi) A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering in all 1,000 souls ; Ghafiri in politics, Ibadhi in religion. They are found in Oman Proper at Earq in Wadi Kalbu; in Western Hajar at Qasmitein and Teikha in Wadi Beni 'Auf, at Fara', Misfah, and Naziyah in Wadi Fara', and at 'Awabi in Wadi Beni Kharus. 12. 'Aivdmir (sing. 'Amiri) A large tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering probably 10,000 souls ; of Nizari descent, but now Hinawi in politics and Ibadhi in religion ; about 6,500 are settled and 3,500 are Bedouins. To take the settled portion first: in Oman Proper they possess the villages of 'Aqil, Qal'at el-'Awamir, Felej, Hameidhah, Quriyatein, Qarut, Khurmah, Shafa', Seiyahi, and Suq el-Qadim, and are found at Nizwa; they occur also at Muscat town, Beit el-Felej, and Ruwi in the Muscat district; at Ghallah and Sad in Wadi Boshar ; at Heil A1 'Umeir, Sib, and Ma'bilah in Batinah ; at Khodh in Wadi Sema'il and at Khubar and Luwiz in Daghmar. Their sections are Aulad Ahmed, Aulad 'Ali ibn Hamad, Aulad 'Ali ibn Khalf, Aulad Amir, Haramilah, Ja'afarah, Aulad el-Ja'id, Khanajirah, Mohammed, Aulad Musa, Rakhbah, Aulad Rashid, Aulad Saba, Aulad Seif, Aulad Salim, Aulad Sand, Sarahin, Sarahin el-Muweilah, and Aulad Shiraz; at Sib a section called Aulad Maheyyi is found. The Bedouin portion range the borders of the Ruba' el-Khali from Trucial Oman in the north, which they occasionally visit in small numbers, to the district of Dhofar on the southern coast of Arabia. A term 'Afar frequently used in connexion with the 'Awamir appears to denote a portion of the tribe inhabiting a territory, called 'Afar, between Mahot and Dhofar ; it includes representatives of many sections. The 'Afar are popularly supposed to feed upon carrion : they deny this, but they wear skins and admit that they are not infrequently reduced to devouring them. The 'Awamir are reputed brave and warlike but crafty, treacherous,550 SETTLED TRIBES OE THE SOUTH and predatory ; they are said to plunder indiscriminately all whom they meet, not excepting members of their own tribe with whom they happen to be unacquainted. They speak a peculiar dialect of Arabic, which varies to such an extent that the westernmost Bedouin sections are hardly understood by their settled brethren in Oman Proper. The 'Awamir are at feud with the Jannabah and the Daru'. 13. l Awdndt (sing. A tribe of Trucial Oman, now practically extinct; about 50 are found at Khatt and Jezirat el-Hamra. Some even deny that these 60 are genuine 'Awanat. 14. Al (or l Aydl) 'Aziz (sing. 'Azizi) A small tribe, numbering 700 souls; settled in Dhank town in Dhahirah ; in politics Ghafiri, in religion Ibadhi and Sunni. They are usually reckoned as Na'im (see p. 581), but their true origin is not known. 15. Beni'Azzdn (sing. A very small tribe, numbering 20 souls; settled in Nakhl in Western Ha jar ; in politics Ghafiri, in religion Ibadhi. 16. Badd'ah (sing. Bada'i) A small tribe, numbering 120 souls; settled in Bidit in Wadi Mabrah in Western Ha jar ; in politics Ghafiri, in religion Ibadhi. 17. Al Badar (sing. A tribe of the Oman Sultanate, numbering 1,200 souls; Hinawi in politics and Ibadhi in religion ; settled at Barkah and Billah in Batinah. 18. Bahdrinah (sing. Bahrani does not mean ' native of Bahrein '. It is the name of the race, or class, to which nearly all the Shiahs of the Bahrein Islands, of the Hasa and Qatif oases, and the Qatar promontory belong. The Sunni inhabitant of Bahrein describes himself as Ahl el-Bahrein. As employed along the western coast of the Persian Gulf the term Bahrani is practically a synonym for a Shiah whose mother tongue is Arabic. Altogether the Baharinah number not less than 100,000 souls, of whom only 850 are in Oman, viz. 250 in Sohar town in the OmanOMAN 551 Sultanate and 600 in the towns of Abu Dhabi and Dibai in Trucial Oman. They are all Shiahs, unwarlike in character and engaged in peaceful pursuits ; the richer living by trade and the poorer by husbandry, pearl-diving, and various handicrafts. The local tradition is that they are descended from Arab tribes who were converted to Shiism 300 years ago, but some European writers are inclined to regard them as aborigines conquered by the Arabs. 19. BeniBahri (sing. Bahri) A small tribe of 500 souls ; settled in Western Hajar at 'Aliya and 'Awabi in Wadi Beni Kharus and at Hibra in Wadi Ma'awal; in politics Ghafiri, in religion Ibadhi. 20. Baluchi, or Balush (sing. Balushi) In Baluchistan the word Baldch is strictly used to designate certain respectable middle-class tribes of the country only ; but in the Gulf of Persia and Oman it is used in a wider sense to include all immi grants from Baluchistan and persons whose mother tongue is the Baluchi language. In the Oman Sultanate there are 20,000 Baluchis excluding Jadgals, who in Baluchistan are reckoned as Balochis but here are designated under their proper name from other Balush. In Trucial Oman they number 1,400. In religion they are seldom Shiahs, even abroad, and they settle more readily among Arab than Persian communities. They were originally introduced as mercenaries, and are still largely in military service. The rest incline to sea-faring occupations, and some have amalgamated with the Arabs inland. Their distribution is as below : In the Sultanate :— Muscat District . . . Muscat town, Matrah, Sidab, Qabil 'Ali ibn Zaman, Mizra' el-'Alawi. Batinah ....

They arrange their hair in a top-knot instead of binding it with a fillet. Their dialect differs from that of other Bedouins of Oman and has not been investigated yet. The A1 Kathir are a Hinawi tribe, and claim to have emigrated from Hadhramaut three centuries ago, conquering Dhofar Proper and establishing a capital at Dahariz. In religion they are Ibadhis. They are at constant feud with the Qaras, whom in their arms, clothing, and habits they resemble.572 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH 95.

This tribe of the Oman Sultanate is also called Beni Ghafir, but the alternative name is apt to lead to confusion between the Miyayihah tribe and the Ghafiri political faction to which the tribe belongs and to which it gave its name. It has not now, and never had, as a tribe, any dominant position in the Ghafiri political faction : that the faction was named after it was due not to the strength of the tribe but to the personal energy and talents of its Sheikh, Mohammed ibn Nasir, who commanded the faction in the earliest struggle against the Hinawi. The Tamimah of the Miyayihah is no longer head of the Ghafiri faction. The Miyayihah number about 7,000 souls, all settled.

The district of Jau, in which the Bireimi oasis is situated, may be regarded as their head-quarters, but they predominate in Dhahirah on the east, and on the west extend to Khatam, which they share with the Beni Yas and the Dhawahir. In the winter some of them pasture their animals on the watershed between the Bireimi oasis and Sohar, and are an important factor in tribal politics at the head of Wadi Hatta. On the north their principal grazing ground is the plain of Jiri, which is shared by their Khawatir section with the Ghafalah tribe. In the direction of Sharjah the tract known as Gharif was once in their possession, but they were displaced by the Beni Ka'ab, who, in their turn, have had to cede it to the Beni Qitab. Roughly speaking there are ordinarily 1,200 Na'im Bedouins in Trucial Oman, 900 in the Sultanate, and 400 in independent Oman.

They call themselves Hakli, speak a language which has been described as a dialect of Mahri, and are commonly stated to be a branch of the Mahrah tribe. They differ greatly in appearance and character from the typical Arab, who regards them as heathens. They are classed as Sunnis of the Ghafiri faction, but it is doubtful whether they are Arabs at all. They keep camels, cattle, sheep and goats, and subsist chiefly by collecting frankincense and other gums. They also do a little cultivation and a little business in hides and In winter they live in caverns which, if large enough, they share with their animals. One cavern at Dirbat is 150' x 50' x 30'. A few have guns, the rest use iron swords, daggers, and even pointed throwing sticks. They carry a shield which serves also as a hat or water bucket or stool as desired.

Outside Trucial Oman the subjects of Sharjah are sometimes spoken2?4 OMAN 585 of as Jawasim, and a tribe which has submitted to the sheikh is said to have become ' Jasimi'; to this fact is probably due the indiscriminate application in old British records of the term ' Joasmee' to all the piratical inhabitants of what is now Trucial Oman. The Trucial flag of 1820 unfortunately came to be known, and is still known, as the Jasimi flag, and the Beni Yas of Abu Dhabi have consequently always shown a disinclination to fly it. The genuine Qawasim in Trucial Oman in 1905 only numbered 18 adult males. Other Qawasim to the number of 650 occur at Duvvan in the Lingeh district of the Persian coast. A tribe of Qawasim, supposed to be identical with the genuine Qawasim by some, while others hold it to be a section of the Mda- biyin, is settled in the Oman Sultanate at Miltiqa in Wadi Sema'il, Nafa'ah in Wadi Mansah, Felej el-Hijari in Wadi Riseil, Mizra' el-'Alawi in Wadi Maih, and at Bandar Jissah on the Muscat coast. This tribe numbers 1,100 souls. 151. Beni Qitab (sing. Qitbi) A tribe of Oman, having a considerable range over the promon tory and in Dhahirah.

They are said to be of Yemeni descent and among the earliest Arab settlers in Oman. They are well to do and peaceable, but those of the hills are disliked as being irascible, slothful, immoral, and inhospitable ; the prejudice against them may be partly due to their disregard of Mohammedan principles in drinking a wine made by themselves from home-grown grapes. They are described as haggard and prematurely old and lacking the usual vivacity and strength of mountaineers. The women go unveiled and are sometimes of a clear ruddy complexion. Their sections are Jawa- mid at Seiq and Shareiqiyin at Misfah. 160. Riydyisah (sing.

In Wadi Boshar they are found at Fuleij esh-Sham (15), in Wadi Dima at Hajir (100), and in Oman Proper at Izki, Khadhra Bin Daffa' (60), Nizwa (4), and Saddi (10). In Wadi Mistal they occur at Ghubrah Beni Ruwahah (40) and Heil (40). The greater part of Wadi 'Andam belongs to them and the whole of Wadi Mahram. They are a troublesome tribe ; they were against the Sultan of Oman from 1871 to 1888 consistently, and are supposed to be still very hostile ; but they can be bought, as they were in 1905, when the Sultan made use of them. Half a mile below the village of Wabal, in Wadi Beni Ruwahah, is a wall with towers and a gate through which the highway leads. This is called Darwazah (door), and its object is to close the route up the valley. It is permanently held by a garrison of the Beni Ruwahah.f T OMAN 589 territory 25 miles in length towards the east end of Batinah, but a number of coastal villages in their tract are in other hands.

They are also found at Khabbah and Hadhib, the town of that name 5 m. E. of Khaburah. Among Arabs they are reputed unwarlike, mean spirited, and inhospitable. They are wealthy, owning hundreds of thousands of date-palms and a considerable area under grain, also many trading and fishing boats. They pay nothing to the present Sultan, and have always been inclined to side with the Azzan branch of his family. On the whole, however, they give no trouble so long as they are left alone. The principal divisions are ; Location, Muladdah, Bat-hah Suweiq, and Khadhra Masna'ah, Sur el-Qarat, and Tharmad Masna £ ah, Sur el-Qarat, and Tharmad Tarif, Muladdah, and Raqqas Masna'ah, Tau esh-Shawi, Raqqas, and Khadhra Khabbah and Hadhib iother tribe of Yal Sa'd in the Oman Sultanate numbering 150 souls ; Ibadhi in religion but Ghafiri in politics, settled at Daris in Wadi Fara'.

Their principal settlements are at Bidyah (300 houses), Eujdrah (150), Gharfah (100), Marbah (100), Qareyyah (100), Qidfa' (100), and Ghallah (70). About half of those residing in the Shameiliyah tract have suc ceeded (1905), under the leadership of the Sheikh of Fujeirah, in casting off the yoke of Sharjah. Their independence has not, how ever, been recognized by the British Government.OMAN 593 The occupations of the Sharqiyin are various. They cultivate, fish ; dive for pearls, trade with Muscat and Sib, grow dates, and keep live stock, according to the facilities of the place where they reside. Their sections are Hafeitat, Yamamahah, Hamudiyin. Some claim the Jalajilah, Maharizah, and Zahum as sections of the Sharqiyin, but this is not certain. 187. Shawdfi 1 (sing.

The whole of the Ru'us el-Jibal district is in their occupation, except a few villages belonging to the Dhahu- riyin. They also occupy Sha'am, Ghalilah, and Khor Khuweir in the Sharjah principality and the village of Heil in Sir, and are found, too, at Saham town in Batinah. Their number is roughly estimated at 21,500 souls, of whom 14,500 are on the coast and 7,000 in the interior. Those of the interior are described as Bedouin, but some of them have houses built of loose stone. The Shihuh are almost entirely included in the dominions of the Sultan of Oman. Only about 2,000 of those on the coast and a few of those in the interior are resident in Trucial Oman. There is little intercourse between the coastal Shihuh and their brethren of the interior, many of whom never come down to the coast. The former are chiefly engaged in diving and wading for pearls and in fishing, though they keep goats and grow dates where they can ; their food is chiefly fish which they catch, rice which they import, and dates which they grow and import. The latter are engaged in tending large flocks of goats and in agriculture. With irrigation from natural reservoirs in the hills they grow almost all the grain they want for home consumption. They live on the produce of their cultivation and their goats, and have nothing to do with the sea. ARABIA I x&gt; T \594 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE SOUTH In religion the Shihuh, both settled and nomad, are mostly Shafeis but from and including Sha'am and Bei'ah southwards on either side of the promontory they are now Hanbalis. As a tribe they are still imperfect Moslems ; those in the hills have no mosques and are extremely superstitious, still offering sacrifices to the mountain Jinns. From the time of the Wahabite movement, however, thev have given up worshipping at Mazars or tombs of holy men. There are two languages spoken amongst them. The more general is the Shihhi dialect of Arabic ; the other is an Iranian dialect chiefly spoken at Kumzar, and on Larak Island by the Kumazirah sub division of the Beni Shateir and their Dhahuxiyin relations. Prom this fact it is inferred that the Shihuh are a composite tribe, originally Arab, but now containing some Persian elements. There are two main divisions of the tribe : 1. Beni Hadiyah. 2. Beni Shateir. The coastal Shihuh regard only these two main divisions and classify themselves in detail by villages and not by subsections. In the interior the classification is by subsections. The following is the classification by sections among the nomad Shihuh of the interior: Section. Families, Location* The hills above Khasab Hills above Limah Beni Mohammed 'Abeid Beni 'Ali.

B This tribe, which is intimately connected with the Sebei' and Sahul (see p. 74), is said to be represented among the inhabitants of the villages of Rumadan and Turabah in the district of Wadi Sebei'. 6. D This widely diffused tribe, which has almost ceased to be Bedouin (see p. 75), is settled in various districts of Nejd ; the Saieyyiland Wadi Dawasir divisions of Wadyan Dawasir belong almost entirely to them. In Aflaj they occupy the following places : Badi', Haddar, Hamar, Kharfah, Marwan, Rajeijiyah, Raudhah, Wasit, and Wuseilah. In 'Aridh, Dawasir are found in the following places in Mahmal: Bir, Dqalah, Hasi, Jarinah, Malham, Sufurrah, and Thadiq ; and in Wadi Hanifah at 'Ammariyah, Darlyah and Manfuhah ; they also occur in Dhrumah and Mizahmiyah. Their settlements in Kharj are at Dilam, Suleimiyah, and Yemamah; in Hariq-Hautah at Hariq town, Hautah town, and Hilwah; in Woshm, at Marat; in Sedeir, at 'Audah, Ghat, Hasun, Jalajil, Ma'ashibah, Raudhah, Ruweidhah, and Zilfi; in Qasim, at Hatan, Huweilan, Quwei'ah and Shamasiyah. In the district of Wadi Sebei' and Wadi Turabah they are settled in Hazam, Khurmah, Raudhah, Rumadan, and Suweyyid. Beyond the limits of Nejd, Dawasir are found in great numbers in Bahrein (see p. 313), whither they immigrated in 1845, after first settling in Zakhnuniyah Island. Offshoots of this community are found in the Persian coast-district of Dashtistan, in Chah Kutah and its dependent villages, and at the village of Jazirah in Bushire harbour. A few households are also settled at Dohah in El-Qatar, and in Koweit town. It is possible that the A1 Breik are not to be regarded as a main tribe of the Dawasir, since by some authorities they are classified608 SETTLED TRIBES OF THE CENTRE 13.

In the southern districts of Nejd a strong infusion of negro blood is reported, and there are said to be many full negroes, especially in Aflaj and Wadyan Dawasir. 16.
