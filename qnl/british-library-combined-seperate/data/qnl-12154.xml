The papers are primarily receipts and lists of weapons and ammunition requested and subsequently transported from India to Muscat. Most of the correspondence takes place between British Political Agent in Muscat and representatives of the Government of India, however the file contains letters from Sultan Sa'id bin Taymur himself, and the Sultan's military representative in Muscat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Firearms</topic></subject><subject><topic>Weapons</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000f7#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000f7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
