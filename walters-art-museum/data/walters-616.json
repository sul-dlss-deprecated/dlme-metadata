The top of the scarab is high and has a simple carved design. The workmanship is slightly rough, and some of the details are out of shape. \r\n\r\nThe piece functioned as an individualized amulet and was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should ensure royal protection and support its owner, and make him as successful in warding against dangers as the king. The scarab was produced after the death of Thutmosis III, who was most probably understood as a protective god and successful model of divine kingship. The combination of different royal manifestations with protective renewal and good luck elements intends to assure the all-inclusive magic power of the amulet. \r\n\r\nThe body and posture of the animal figure in the lower round of the scarab is similar to a donkey, but the long horns, which are too long to be ears, make it more likely that it represents the royal bull. Images of bulls on scarabs are mostly part of a motif showing the animal trampling on an enemy.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1911 (?)", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/26540", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1911 (?)
