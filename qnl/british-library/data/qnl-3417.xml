Stannus transmits an extract from a letter, dated 9 March 1824, from the Agent at Muscat, which concerns a reported act of piracy by two boats from Sharga [Sharjah]. The second enclosure is a translation of a letter, dated 20 November 1823, from Sooltan Bin Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī, ruler of Ra's al-Khaymah and Sharjah] to Captain Charles J Maillard, in which Sooltan Bin Suggur states that the boats in question left Sharga without his knowledge. In his letter, Stannus makes the case for Sooltan Bin Suggur's duplicity in this affair. He includes two further enclosures: a translation of a letter, dated 24 March 1824, addressed by Stannus to Sooltan Bin Suggur, in which Stannus discusses the two piraticial boats without referring to Sooltan Bin Suggur's communication with Captain Maillard; and a letter, dated 24 March 1824, from Stannus to Captain Charles Sealy, Senior Marine Officer in the Persian Gulf, in which Stannus requests that the two boats in question, which are reported to have committed the first act of piracy since the conclusion of the treaty [the General Maritime Treaty of 1820], be intercepted on their return from Muscat. At the end of this final enclosure, Stannus encloses a letter addressed to Sooltan Bin Suggur (the second enclosure of the original letter), and requests that it be dispatched to Sharga as early as possible.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x00002a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
