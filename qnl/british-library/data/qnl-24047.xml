In it is the first mention of which I have on record regard ing the proposal to import 'skilled Iraqi labour' into Bahrain. This will probably be not free from complications and I should like to know urgently regarding this labour. a) Its quantity. b) The work it is going to do. c) Its wage rates.To A.L.O. R.A.F., Bahrein (in duplicate) From R.3. Bahrein Date: 7th May 1945. Messrs. Solel Boneh Contractors It is advised that Mr. S. Steiner &amp; Mr. M. Julis^ representatives on site of above firm will be emplaning for Habbaniya Iraq on or about the 9th inst. and will be returning to Bahrein very shortly. As the likelihood of repeated journeys- is more than probable, it would be appreciated if you can arrange permanent visas for Iraq and Bahrein for above named agents of Jewish nationality through the Political Agent. Also as the importation to Bahrein of skilled Iraqui labour is now imminent it v/ould be helpful if the Political Agent can communicate with the. Iraquian Consulate in order that their Bahrein visas can be prearranged. Sd. Resident Engineer, A.M.Yv.D. Bahrain. Countersigned . H.C. Parker A. L.0• 12-5-45.1 mmmmm From;- Rhe Air Liason Officer.

(b) The R.A.F. were responsible for re-patriating the Labour when no longer required. (c) The R.A.F. were responsible for accommodating, feed ing, and generally controlling the Labour whilst in Bahrain. In consequence of this agreement by the Political Agent, Air headquarters Iraq and Persia have made all arrangements for the Labour to be imported and it is to be hoped that no objections will be raised at the last minute which will seriously jeopardise the construction programme at Muharraq. It will be appreciated that the work has now been stepped up to the highest priority. S ' At'&amp;JLr. Wing Commanders' Air Liason Officer. Copy to- Resident Engineer, AMWB,R.A.F.
