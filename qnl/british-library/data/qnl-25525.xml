Anglo- P rench-Russian Agreement. 2. Mr. RICHARD LAMBERT asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether the Anglo-French-Russian Agree ment of 21st February, 1917, is still held r °u b t on the parties to it; and whether this country still affirms its inten tion to hand over Ispahan and Yezd, in Persia, to Russia, and to extend the British sphere of influence in Persia over the zone determined as neutral by the Agreement of 1907? The MINISTER of BLOCKADE (Lord Robert Cecil) : I know of no Agreement i corresponding to that referred to by the hon. Member. As regards a possible revi sion of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, I would refer the hon. Member to the reply returned to the question put by the hon. Member for Xorth Somerset on the 3rd instant. Sir J. D. REES: Does not the use of the expression ‘‘Hand over Ispahan and Zeyd ” show a complete misapprehension as to what such agreements as these really are ? Lord R. CECIL : Yes, Sir; an entire mis understanding. Mr. OUTHWAITE: In any rearrange ment that is made will the right hon. Gentleman seek to establish the inde pendence of Persia? Lord R. CECIL: The hon. Gentleman is no doubt aware of our obligations in that respect.0 &lt;/ o 3 [ Or Ci^j^ol'^v^s J PEKSIA &lt;ANGLO-Rl SSlAX CONVENTION). 22. Mr. KING asked whether by anr agreement or understanding arrived at during the W ar this country has expressed its intention, or taken power, to establish British influence over that part of I ersia declared to be neutral in the agreement with Russia made in 1907 : Lord R. CECIL: No definite proposals have been made in the matter, although His Majesty’s Government have signified to the Russian Government that a revision of the Anglo-Russian Convention in the sense indicated will be a matter for eventual discussion between the two Governments.tt. Consulate, Kermanshah Dated the 12th April 1917. Jo. 1 &amp; &amp; &amp; Sir, 2 i 9 0 D 'O &lt; r ‘* ! / n')'*' 6 : j ^ J^J / I I have the honour to ^dr&lt;6^5‘~yoTi On the subject of the line delimiting the Russian and neutral spheres, as it affects Kermanshah an&lt;1 adjacent provinces. There is no correspondence on record in this Consulate on this subject, and I therefore write in ignorance of the exact considerations which led to the adoption of the present line,or whether any modification of it has since been proposed. Its in conveniences however- apart from specie* 1 disadvantages to our selves- are so obvious that it may he sunposed that the Kasri- Shirin-Ispahan line was only traced as a makeshift, pending the establishment of a line that would follow provincial boundaries. Dow that Baghdad has been occupied by our troops, I venture to think that this question should, if oossible, be re considered, before the establishment of a new condition of things, that might make the reopening of the matter more cif- ficult. The existence of oil and coal deposits in the Kasra Shirin district will make this area of great importance in the future. There is again the fact that the Baghdad-Kermanshah road is the only natural gateway into Persia from Mesopotamia and will certainly form the alignment of a railway in ^ture. It is therefore of the first importance ^hat^^ir influence in y ermanshab should he ^eIt, especially ^ith regard to such natters as the improvement of communications, telegraphs and Customs, as also in the management of the Persian herder trj bes. The Minimum concession that would secure to us the advantages alluded to and also give recognition to the predominant influence no’’ possess in Luristan and !akhtiari would be the alteration of the line to one following the boundary between the Kermanshah and iv urdistan provinces. Such a line would run from the iersian frontier on the west to the© /**&gt;/ tri-junction of the -boundaries of the provinces named with Hamadan. It would thence follow the Kermanshah houndary to its junction with that of Luristan. This would leave the districts of Tusakhan, vehavend, and -alayar (called topether Cielasa) on the Russian side. The Lurietan honndary would then he follo'-ed to its junction with the AWhistan houndrrar.which ■province officially includes also the whole o'- the Rakhtiari country. It would of oohrse he of advantage if the province of Araq, in which there is a considerable amount of 'British capital invested in the carpet industry, could also he con- ceeded, hut the above it, as has been said, the minimum that could reasonably be claimed in view of our newly acquired position at Uaphdad. It is probable also that the principal carpet firms of Arrq would transfer their establishments to the Kermanshah province if the latter were brought within the neutral commercial sphere. I do not follow the line further as I am not competent to express an opinion on t'-e -'ost dc- glrsMe alignment further ^ T have in the forgoing presumed the continuance of a neutra sphere. If the neutral sphere is abolished it isdesirable that the British sphere should extend to the line indicated above as a minimum. Wy personal opinion is however that it would he more advantageous to us to extend the neutral sphere as suggested than to extend the British sphere to include the neutral sphere as at present defined if these were alternatives. This conclusion is based on the practical certainty that our superior activity would soon gain for us commercial predonin, woe in a sphere in which both powers hrfl equal opportunities. Since however when the present spheres were determined, all Persian provinces conterminous with Russian territory were allotted to the exclusively Russian sphere, it may he hoped that the Russian foreign Office would no'-' agree to the same principle being applied in the card of the Persian provinces J )© and should be returned to the Foreign _Qfflce when done with unless required tor official use.] from me that the Government would approach us with proposals to substitute neutrals tor British officers in southern persia Rifles.

( 10710 .) .j 056 1 Memorandum respecting the Revision of the Anglo^BussU.^ . Convention of 1907. PART 2 of the memorandum of the Political Department of the India Office sets forth so comprehensively the British desiderata in Persia that there is little comment to offer from the point of view of the Foreign Office, unless it lie a fear that all these requirements can scarcely be regarded as any longer within the range of practical politics. The genesis oi the present discussion does not lie in any new suggestion by Russia that the two Powers should allocate afresh the whole of Persia into two spheres, to be assigned to one or other of them. On the contrary, it is to be found in an invitation made by the Russian Government to His Majesty’s Government to enter into possession of practically the whole of the neutral sphere. To accept this offer and in the same breath to ask for a considerable area of the present Russian sphere can scarcely be held likely to facilitate our negotiations. It is accordingly submitted that the line of demarcation now advocated by the Government of India should be abandoned at the outset, and that, so far as the inclu sion of territory in the new British sphere is concerned, our efforts should be concentrated on the towns of Ispahan and Yezd, or, in the last resort, on Yezd alone. The great importance to British interests of recovering our position and freedom of action in Ispahan is emphasised in the India Office memorandum both as regards the Bakhtiari and our approach to the oil-wells and the Persian Gulf, and some notes to this effect which His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has just furnished on the subject are annexed hereto. Asa counterpoise to this cession on the part of Russia, an offer might be made to surrender to her the oil-bearing districts in the neighbourhood of Kermanshah, which at present belong, in a more or less undeveloped state, to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. That Russia attaches great price to these wells was clearly shown in the summer of 1914, when His Majesty’s Government invested some 2 , 000 , 000 Z. in that oil company. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Petrograd was severely reproached by the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject, and reported by telegraph that— “M. Sazonof said that action taken by His Majesty’s Government (in purchasing shares of Anglo-Persian Oil Company) had changed whole character of concession. He did not want oil. Russia had enough and to spaie, and we were at liberty to develop all the oil areas in south marked on Blue Book map, but it was a different matter with those near Kermanshah. Russian public [? opinion] would never tolerate arrangement under which a company controlled by Biitish Government could operate in Russian zone and Aiituall v absorb whole of the neutral zone. He did not want to make difficulties, hut he must ask us to slate publicly that we would not avail ourselves of all the rights conferred on D’Arcy by the concession. “ I repeated all the arguments used in vour above-mentioned telegrams, and insisted that nothing had °l)een changed. His Excellency, however, adhered to what lie had said, and, as his view of the matter is universally held here, he is not likely to give way. .. ^ c “ I would therefore venture to submit that it is advisable lor us to oiler Russia some satisfaction with regard to oil-wells in the north. We do not apparently intend to develop them for vears to come, and there is such a large held open to us in south that it is worth company’s while to make a little sactifice to gain Russia s g°od-w^ concession Anglo-Persian Company is empowered to found subsidiary companies for the working of its concession, and Russian opposition would, I think, be disarmed were His Majesty’s Government to undertake that when f1009] B2 time comes for developing oillields near Kermansliab, 01 any otlieisthat may be discovered to the north of those marked on Blue Book map as leporteu oil areas, an Anglo-Russian colony, somewhat on lines of Anglo-German company in Mesopotamia, should be formed for their exploitation. No term need be fixed for opening up of these oilfields, but if they are ever to be developed company would I believe, gain by working in co-operation with, rather than in opposition to, TtussiET^ It is the political rather than the economic side of the question that is of importance in the eyes of the Bussian Government, and such a spontaneous offer on our part might dispose them to adopt a more conciliatory attitude with regard to larger question of their general policy in Persia.” While the question of supply is primarily a matter for the Admiralty to decide, the desirability of finding adequate compensation for Russia necessarily falls on the Foreign Office. It is suggested that this oilfield in the neighbourhood of Kermanshah might be more appropriately used as a lever regarding Ispahan or Yezd than, as was proposed by the India Office memorandum, p. 5, as a counterpoise to railway activity as far as, or even beyond, Meshed. This latter point of railway construction might be dealt with in connection with the fresh alignment of the spheres in the Zulfikar triangle, especially in view of the probability that after the war the question of Russian finance will for a considerable time necessitate every possible economy. The reference in point 5 of the Russian memorandum of the 22 nd March to the desired priority of Russia’s rights in the northern sphere “ for financial and economic undertakings ” is clearly aimed at the position in those regions of the Imperial Bank of Persia. This company, incorporated in September 1889 upon the basis of a concession to Baron de Reuter, has for over twenty-five years been the State Bank with the monopoly of issuing notes. The concession is to be in force for sixty years, and empowers the bank to establish its head office (“ sibge social ”) at Tehran, and branches in other towns in Persia and abroad. The bank may also undertake on its own account, or on account of third parties, all sorts of business, financial, industrial, or commercial, on condition that none of these undertakings be contrary to the treaties, laws, usages, or religion of the country, and that previous notice thereof be given to the Persian Government. Certain additions to the concession were made on the 27th July, 1889, but these do not affect the right of the bank to establish branches in towns of Persia. According to the “Statesman’s Year Book ’ for 1915, the bank has branches at Tabriz, Resht, Kazvin, Meshed, Ispahan, Yezd, Shiraz, Kerman, Ramadan, Seistan, Kermanshah, Bushire, Mohammerah, Aiiwaz, and Sultanabad ; and agencies at several other towns. By the convention signed at St. Petersburgh on the 31st August, 1907, England and Russia engage not to seek or to apply for concessions of a political or commercial nature, such as railways, banks, telegraphs, roads, transport, insurance, &amp;c., within t e spheie lelt to the other of these two countries, nor to oppose, either directly or lu . demands for such concessions supported by the other of the two countries within its particular sphere. By article 3 of this convention it is provided that all existing concessions in the two spheres are maintained. Gn the other hand, the Russian company (Banque d’Escompte), though an offshoot of the Russian Ministry of Finance, has never been a successful undertaking, and is nou in veiy low water. Last year the two banks came to an arrangemefit, at the ms ance of the Russian Bank, regarding a minting contract for the Persian Government. 10 ussi aii dknm is, however, exceedingly jealous of the position and good standing of the Imperial Bank, and loses no opportunity of endeavouring to thwart the latter’s successful business operations. The Imperial Bank, with its head office at Tehran, and with nine branches (out of een) in the present Russian sphere, would have every reason to protest with justice against any limitation in the Russian sphere of its activities as the ic ussians iaye no similar institutions in either the present British or presen neu ra sp ere. , t len, His Majesty s Government decide eventually in any way t ri l e p . e usslau ^quest and to limit the Imperial Bank’s activities to the remainde of Persia-a course which it is submitted could not be viewed without considerabl alarm regarding the prosperity of one of the soundest British interests in the Middl ast such cession could be used as a most valuable lever with regard to the inclusio of Ispahan in the new British sphere. ^ rv P i r3 It would, however, hardly be possible to take such a course unless His Maiestv’s “P*' 1 rf,h ' ““'“v i S*h an iinlnrtmity would k. dl««,lf”™n“ tl ' Annex. A otes by Mr. Marling. U ,? E . N / + 7 as P aSSm ' throu g h Petrograd I saw M. Sazonof, who, in sneaking on the subject ot the disappearance of the neutral zone in Pers.a, insisted very fifmW on the desne of Russia to obtain a modification of the present limits of the ^Rusdan sphere, so as to include the Ispahan district as well as the town. He intimated that this extension was required so as to protect Russian trade in the Russian sphere from mtht Take'Yezd raerC f ia ' lt f.&gt; and llinted ^at if we desired a pro quo we g a e ezd. 1 e also wished the extreme eastern end of the present limits to the Russian sphere to be brought a little south ward for military reasons, which “ he could not explain, as lie did not understand them.” M. Sazonof was quite va^ue as to the area of the Ispahan districts, but at the ussian Legation here I have heard that Kumisheh, some 45 miles away on the Shiraz road, would be included ; J have no other indication as to the remainder of the area desire !, but the mention of Kumisheh makes it look as though a very considerable tract may be contemplated. J 1 he justification put forward for this claim seems to me to be totally inadequate am 1 mge that instead of Kussk being allowed to push further south, Ispahan and a certain area north should, in our interests—and even partly in Russian interests also— be included m our sphere. The leasons for our claiming Ispahan are almost entirely bound up with the position ot the Bakhtiaris, whose territory, if we accede to the Russian desideratum, would je cut in two unequal parts, the smaller and northern part being in the Russian zone, and the larger part, now in the neutral zone, falling to us. Although by no means the most numerous tribe in Persia, the Bakhtiaris, in spite of family squabbles, constitute probably the most important tribal unit in the Empire, and they have been taught the value of unity by the considerable role which they in late years, thanks to our support, have played, and still play, in Persian polities. They would therefore certainly resent very strongly a partition of their territory, and their resentment would be directed against us rather than against Russia. Until quite recently the tribe was practically open to no foreign influence except our own, and looked to His Majesty’s Minister to settle all their internal quarrels and to adjust the nice ^ balance of power between the two branches when the question of the appointment of the Ilkhani and the Ilbeggi came up. Even the big push which Russia has been making at Ispahan of late, and the intimate relations which the Russian consul succeeded in establishing with Sardar Ashjaa, did not seriously shak 1 Sir W. Townley’s influence with the khans (one section looked to him as their protector against the Zil-es-Sultan, whose vast interests in Ispahan had just been taken under Russian protection). Since then, however, events have occurred which furnish a useful object-lesson. To assist the Russian Legation to obtain satis faction for the murder of Baron von Kaver at the end of May, I was constrained to agree to the application of the “Russian - ’ Sardar Ashjaa as Governor of Ispahan to replace Sardar-i-Motesham, and this concession to Russia, the significance of which i he khans misunderstood and exaggerated, gave them an idea that we were, for the moment, powerless, so that they got quite out of hand, while simultaneously German blandishments and German gold proved such an attraction that at one moment our influence with the khans was scarcely more than traditional. That state of affairs 1 ^ OV.CVi- V-'V_'A V - 111 ' 'JL U 1 1 Ci A It V*. a JL 1 U. J.J.

The result cann &gt;t be questioned. The tribe would be divided into “British” and “Russian” parties, but both parties possessing a common grievance against Great Britain, viz., that by what they would vie.v as weakness she had permitted the division of the tribe.

The Bakhtiari summer quarters aie in die districts west of Ispahan, and would partly or wholly—supposing the Russian frontier followed the circumference of a circle drawn with Ispahan as c^tre am e distance Ispahan-Kurmisheh as radius—fall within the Russian sphere. ic tov\n itse. is the tribe’s market, whither they repair every summer to sell their nocks and produce, and where they buy their European goods for the following season. With the wealth they have of late years acquired the khans have bought lands, gardens, and villages in the neighbourhood of Ispahan, and in the town itself have accumulated quite considerable interests. It is at Ispahan, too, that the periodic family assembly to discuss tribal affairs takes place. It is not too much to say that half the interests of the ti ihe, both practical and sentimental, are centred at Ispahan, and it requires only the most superficial knowledge of Bakhtiari character to realise that to place Ispahan and its surrounding districts under the protection of Russia would be to create a constant source of irritation and friction between us. Since writing the foregoing I have gathered from conversations with M. de Etter that, in his opinion, Russian claim should be limited to a very small area immediately round the town of Ispahan. If this should be the official view also, the force of my argument would, of course, be modified, but not by any means to a degree commensurate with the reduction of the Russian claim. The whole case was put in a nutshell only a few days ago by Sardar Assad, who, without any invitation from me, remarked abruptly, “If you want quiet, get the Russians out of Ispahan.” M. de Etter does not wish his opinion to be quoted. It seems to me incredible that the reasons given by M. Sazonof for Russia’s wish to maintain and extend her zone at Ispahan can really account for her readiness to create such an open sore in her relations with us in this part of the world—a sore, moreover, of which we shall be far more sensible than Russia. Still, on what may be termed legal grounds, Russian claims to the region south of Ispahan are, it must be conceded, much stronger than ours to the north, for while Russia only asks for a slice out of the present neutral zone, we are asking for a cession from the Russian sphere. As a matter of “sacrifice,” however, we are to be asked to surrender much more than we require of our Ally. The southern limit of the Russian sphere, as defined by the 1907 convention, passes through Ispahan, not south of it, and according to strict letter of the convention we could have endeavoured to consolidate our interests right up to and even into the south side of the town. But we have not done so, but have recognised in the most liberal way that in and around Ispahan, in spite of our ancient predominance, these Russian interests must be treated with friendly respect. But even so, and notwithstanding the great efforts begun three years ago by the Russian consul and the Russian bank to push Russian interests, Russian influence, though it became a serious competitor, was never in danger of eclipsing our own; and at the present moment— i.e., since the death of Baron von Kaver terminated the contract which placed the vast estates and influence of the Zil-es-Sultan under Russian control—British influence is incomparably the greater of the two. Indeed, were it not that the two Powers are now known to be acting with the most complete harmony, the local influence of Russia—apart from that exercised from Tehran—would be almost nil. We are therefore asking Russia to make but a small sacrifice, viz., to resign a position r rwhich, though legally reserved to her, she has only recently endeavoured to make good. M. Sazonof s reason for an extension of the Russian sphere demands examination. His Excellency believes that by this means Russian trade in the Russian sphere will ^de secured against the British competition under which it now suffers. I venture to ohink that the pcint is open to question. It is one that seems to resolve itself in a question of cost of transport.* It may, 1 think, be assumed that as a consequence of the present war:— 1 . The Khorremabad Railway will not be built. '2. I he construction of the trans-Persian Railway will be indefinitely postponed, and that when built the trace of the line may be governed by quite different considerations from those obtaining in 1912—4. 3. We become virtual masters in Mesopotamia and Bagdad. !i assumptions 1 and 2 are admitted, the question is narrowed down to this: Can the British trader deliver his goods by the Bagdad-Khanikin route into the Russian sphere at a cheaper rate than the Russian merchant ? The large transit trade—the preservation of which was the chief element in deciding His Majesty’s Government to construct the Khorremabad Railway—via Bagdad, which is worth about 1,250,0007. per annum, proves that he can do so, and if this were possible under the regime of Turkish maladministration and obstruction, it will not be contested that if assumption 3 be conceded the British importer will be still better placed under the vastly improved conditions that our rule would achieve in Mesopotamia. Future railway construction, both Russian and British, has to be taken into account, but it is probable that any resulting change will be in favour of British trade — 1 . Because railway construction in the comparatively flat country of Mesopotamia is far cheaper than through the highlands of Western Persia. 2 . Our railway administration is cheaper and more efficient than Russian. 3. If the Willcocks schemes of irrigation are carried out, the vast export trade will enable import freights to be kept down. It is then at least arguable that the inclusion of Ispahan in the Russian sphere will not do for Russian trade all that M. Sazonof expects, any more than as a matter of fact it does at present, though it would possibly secure this trade from our competition at Ispahan itself. The advantage then is so small, and even doubtful, that the real reason of the Russian demand must be sought elsewhere. Is it very far to seek ? It is useless to blink the fact that from the abolition of the neutral zone and the recognition of the “ free hand ” the step to partition is short, and when partition comes about, all possibility of British competition in the Russian sphere will be set at rest by the erection of the Russian tariff wall. I bus, whatever the value of M. Sazonof’s adduced reasons, they at most hold good for a limited period. The sore created bv the division of the Bakhtiari tribe would however still remain, though bv the force of the new circumstances it would eventually be healed by the drastic remedies of Russian administration in the East. It may, perhaps, be permitted to call attention to the fact that M. Sazonof is now ready to violate a principle which, during the Turco-Persian frontier negotiations of 1913, was to be held in special respect, viz., that that frontier should not he so traced as to place one part of a tribe in Persian territory and the other part in that of Turkey. There is another aspect of the case which appears to me to merit study, viz., how the possession by Russia of so large and important a centre as Ispahan must be regarded in relation to our large and ever-increasing interests in the oilfields of Bakhtiarietan and to our future position in Mesopotamia. The question is one of politico-military * The Russian Minister’s reasons postulate that the two routes in the Russian sphere via, Ispahan are more costly than that via Bagdad and Khanikin. I am not quite sure that this is the case, and my attempts to get authentic figures here have failed. In any case, freights vary constantly, but it must be conceded th at— (1.) The irreducible charges owing to second customs examination and to double handling are higher on the Bagdad than on the other routes; . (2.) That the traffic into Persia by Bushire-Ispahan alone (i.e., without counting in that by the nwaz route) is two and a half times greater than that by Bagdad; but allowance must, of course, be made for the fact that the whole of the imports by Bushira and Ahwaz do not reach the Russian sphere.character, but it seems to me to involve interests that are likely to be of first-rate importance in the future. It may be of use, in case His Majesty’s Government decide to endeavour to obtain the cession of Ispahan from Ttussia, that 1 should indicate roughly what modification of the present limits of the Russian sphere would bring the whole of the Bakhtiari tribe within our sphere. Such a line would commence at or about Bultak, where longitude*^ 50° east cuts the present Russian line, and then, running in the direction of Khonsar would turn south-east-east, and follow a line roughly parallel to the present Ru^ian* but 18-20 miles north of it, until it met the circumference of a circle drawn with a 25-mile radius on Ispahan as a centre. The sector of that circle would form our northern frontier until it met the existing Russian line—again on the east side of Ispahan. This line does not constitute a very large deflection of the present limits of the Russian sphere. It does not include all the tribes that bear the name of Bakhtiari, but those that remain outside of it, to the north-w^est, are a distant branch, and have never stood in the same relations to us as have their connections further south.

Extract from Secret Letter from the Government No. 85, dated 29th September 191G. of India, 5. htussia.—W e have already had occasion to submit our opinions on various matters connected with the post helium settlement with Russia, notably in our Foreign Department secret telegrams 1 2 of the 19th April, 13th May, and 12th dune 1915, but we would take this opportunity of somewhat elaborating our views. As regards Persia, if the Persian Government maintain their present attitude of neutrality to the end of the war, we may take it that no question of formal partition will arise, and we earnestly hope that this may be so, for we can only regard the proposition of actual partition, involving as it would a very serious increase in our responsibilities, obligations and expenditure, with grave apprehension. But even without actual partition the future of Persia, of course, presents a very difficult problem and one upon which we feel that at the present moment it is impossible to form any final opinion. The Persian situation is too kaleidoscopic for this. Our view roughly, however, is that there must be a rearrangement of spheres of influence whereby the neutral zone falls to Great Britain. We have already, in the telegrams referred to, suggested what we consider would be the ideal line between our own and the Russian sphere, but the line thus suggested was, we realise, a counsel of perfection, and we have no wish to press for it strongly if it is likely to cause difficulties in the negotiations or to make us appear grasping in our demands. As a pis alley the existing Russian line might be accepted as it stands. We must face, of course, the fact that within her own zone Russia will probably exercise, whatever we may say, an even stricter administrative control than heretofore, and this will perhaps necessitate the exercise of considerably greater interference by our Consular Officers in local administration and finance within our sphere of iniiuence. It would obviously be undesirable to leave our sphere to the chaos of uncontrolled local Persian rule, while the neighbouring Russian sphere was well-ordered and peaceful. Such a condition would only lead to friction and difficulty. We do not suggest, however, by this any attempt at direct administration. Our aim in the immediate future should he to assist the Persian Government so far as possible themselves to establish a reasonably effective administration in Southern Persia. To this end the South Persia Rifles have been created. The extent of our interference with the actual administration must depend upon the extent to which the Persian Govern ment appear capable of improved administration, but, generally speaking, once we have restored a modicum of peace and order in the mam trade centres and on the mam trade routes and re-established commeicial facilities we should be content merely to advise as regards the actual administration of the country itself. Ihis may appear somewhat a make shift arrangement, but short of actual partition it appears to be the onl^ course feasible. As regards the Persian Gulf, we assume that if the present neutial zone falls to us, all Russian claims in the Persian littoral will be ipso facto finally extinguished. It might be desirable perhaps to get this definiteK stated. This somewhat vague admission by Russia referred to in Sir E. Grey’s letter to Sir A. Nicholson, dated 29th August 1907,- in connection with the Anglo- Russian negotiations, might certainly with advantage be reaffiimed in some definite form. 1 Printed in Appendices A and B of Memorandum C. 14l&gt;. 2 Cd. 3750 of 1907, p. 1. s 3 a io Turning to Afghanistan, on the assumption that the Amir maintains his neutrality till the conclusion of the war, we consider that we shall be under considerable obligations to him ; and so 'will Kussia.

It is true that the present conditions in Afghanistan are unsatisfactory in the extreme ; that we know that Afghanistan is a hot-bed of fanatical and anti-British intrigue ; that if the Amir maintains his neutrality it will be due mainly to the fact that Afghanistan lies between the devil and the deep sea—between Russia and ourselves. It is true that Afghanistan has been, and is, a constant source of anxiety; that it has been a base of Pan-Islamist intrigue against the allied powers generally. But in spite cf all this, if Afghanistan continues to the end neutral, we shall be under heavy practical obligations and there can be no question of our agreeing to any alteration in the status of Afghanistan that would interfere with its treasured independence. Indeed, we shall have to consider some signal recognition of the Amir's services, both as a reward for the past and an encouragement for the future. Assuming that the political status of Afghanistan is to remain unaltered we consider it of vital importance to the maintenance of that status without undue difficulty and friction, that Russia should abandon the policy of constant and often frivolous complaint and demand which so often embarrassed us in the period antecedent to the war. We fully admit that the present Afghan system of administration may cause some occasional inconvenience to adjoining Russian territory just as it does in adjoining British territory, but that inconvenience was not, we think, such as to warrant the series of demands and complaints which the Russian Govern ment made in regard to Afghanistan during that period. In 1912 they put ionyard a claim for an irrigation agreement in regard to the Murghab and Han Rud rivers which was entirely inadmissible in the light of the ruling of the Afghan boundary Commission of 1885. In May 1914 they pressed a proposal to construct an irrigation canal from the Oxus with its head works m Afghan territory, without any explanation of the difficulty or impossibility of locating those head-works in Russian territory. In the same year they pressed for a self-denying ordinance on the part of Great Britain in remird to concessions lor railways irrigation, &amp;c., in Northern Afghanistan, which we pointed out could only have the result of exciting the Amir’s liveliest suspicions In May 1915, in connection with the question of the post, helium settlement, they again apparently reverted to this demand. There were also various more or less frivolous complaints, e.g„ connected with locusts which 1 appealed, and Afghan raids into Russian territory which had not occurred Indeed, we were forced to the conclusion that the Russian Oovernmen had made up their minds to have a standing grievance in regard to Afghanistan partly perhaps genuine, partly to bargain with in respect of to embaiXom- leutions uitn the Amir. \\ e hope that with the much more cordial „mW Stand,ng established by the war, Russia may be induced to a£t a lie 2 easonabledud generous policy in regard to Vfcrfnm'cstMn nnri i i • sr ilSsrsTJ?

As regards Tibet, here again we want nothing but a reasonable and generous policy on the part of Russia. The circumstances of the last few years, particularly the Tibet Conference and the consequent secret Treaty between Tibet and Great Britain, have placed Tibet in an even closer relation to ourselves than nefore. and both on this ground and on geographical grounds we muse, we think, insist on our very exceptional position. The Chinese yoke has been removed from Tibet: and the Chinese Government have refused to subscribe to a Treaty actually signed by their representative. For the time being therefore Chinese suzerainty has ceased to exist, at any rate, so iai as Outer 1 ibet is concerned. In these circumstances the Tibetan Govern ment have naturally turned to Great Britain for advice and assistance : and these have naturally been accorded. Until the future relations of China and 11 bet—and indeed the future status of China herself—have been determined, there must inevitably lie a period of diplomatic chaos as regards 11 iet. Until the position clears, we think that Russia might reasonably agree to our continuing the present practice, to which she has as yet taken no exception, and allow us directly to advise and assist the Tibetan Govern ment m despite of Aiticle IT. of the Tibet Agreement of I90i—and herself abstain from all interference in this country. It might be made plain that we have no desire or intention to avail ourselves of anv other privileges, e.g., commercial concessions or the despatch of an Agent to Lhasa, contemplated m the Tripartite Convention. It might be explained that we have no ambitions, territorial or other in Tibet : and that our only wish is that Tibet should develop on peaceful lines without foreign interference. As regards the Xew Dominion, we have nothing to add to what is contained in our telegram of the 14th October 1915, in which we strongly deprecated any attempt to bring Chinese Turkistan into the post helium settlement with Russia. If Russia herself raises the question, we should be glad to be consulted, and we need only now repeat that we regard the recognition of a suitable boundary line on this side as an essential preliminary to any negotiations. It seems inevitable that a complete revision of the Anglo-Russian Agreement! of 1907 will be necessitated by the post helium settlement and doubtless the future of Iraq will form a portion of the revised Agreement. As already stated, this must closely touch our interests. But it is in regard to any revision of the Agreement regarding Afghanistan that we feel the greatest concern ; and we trust that in this respect no arrangement will be concluded without our being given an opportunity of advising on the matter, and if his interests are even remotely affected, of consulting the Amir. This is not onlv obligatory in accordance with a pledge we have recently given him, but it is essential in order to avoid sowing once more in Kabul the seeds of mistrust and suspicion such as were sown by the Agreement of 1907.Put awaj, A.Ji.,., 3 telfe. osrjxsmm /ST^&gt; Ah rm i T Simln he 3rd Septerijber]915. h' r p 3 4 9 3 Please refer to the telegram fromtfre f)ecretary of State for India, dated the 30th August 1915, asking for a map showing the provincial boundaries along which the ^ suggested lines of demarcation in Persia run.

(sd) A.Hirtzel The necessity of coming to an agreement with Russia on this subject without delay is obvious, as onfce Russia is in possession of Constantinople she will he the less ready to make concessions to us. That being sc the immediate point for cons id: ration is what factors arc vital ones for us. The first and supreme factor in the problem is the maintenance of our absolute supremacy in the Persian Gulf. The second great factor is the recognition of the claims we are establisning to £he montml control of Mesopotamia i.e. of the Baghdad - Basra region,and with it of the Karun Valley and the Angle Persian oil fields. The third essential factor is the inclusion in our sphere of the whole of the Bakhtiari region. Finally there is the consideration that tie f jw off we can kc-p Russia and P- saian influence the better for us from a military point of view. The first of the above material factors compels us tc include not only the whole of the provinces of HeMan and Jars in our own sphere but also Arab is tan whilst tne second and third factors call aloud for( 2 ) L'iie inclusion of* the whole ol* Xhuzistan and Luristan* Tith those provinces in our complete possession or under our undisputed political influence we r®. y I thinh he said to have secured for ourselves all. military and strategical points essential to us. T7e shall have entire cpntrol of the GrU.if and the Oilfields and of Tersian Seistan and we shall dominate all possible railway lines approaching India and Afghanistan except of course the one through Herat. There is however still the consideration that the further we can keep Russia away the letter and therefore as Sir Arthur Hirtzwl proposes we should endeavour to include Yazd and Ispahan in our sphere in the TTest and as the Viceroy sug gests Grhain fKain) and SirJand on the East. Indeed I am not at all sure that we should not also include Yun and Tahhas which are important oases and .might he useful out posts in the great eta am® rib desert which protects out sphere on the Hcrth. However I should he quite content if we got hir^and and Grhain and Yazd for it seems to me highly impro bable that Russia would agree to surrendering Ispahan whifch by the Anglo Russian agreement of 1907 was so lightly aban- doned to Russia. Ghain and Birjand are really more impor tant than Yazd for the reason that if we are at war with Russia the main Russian line of attack must be via Herat, in which case a developed Seistan may have a first rate importance ij tt for us as a flanking position, which again might attract an attack through Birjand. Lord Curzon T s memorandum on the defence of Seistan written about 1902 or 1903 explains clearly the importance of Seistan and its approaches.SECRET. C. 142. Revision of Angio-Russian Convention of 1907 I. hi accepting the Russian proposals about Constantinople His Majesty’s Government deferred stating their own desiderata, but said that they would include the transfer of the neutral sphere in Persia to *our sphere. In accepting this the Rus. ic*n Government revived certain questions connected with Afghanistan which had been discussed last year in connexion with Tibet. Thus in effect the whole of the Anglo-Russian Agreement has been brought into question. Before going into details there are one or two generalities to be considered. 1. The obvious and natural time to put forward our desiderata about Persia is when we come to discuss with the Allies the future of the Ottoman Empire, and this is what the Foreign Office contemplate. Then will be the time for bargaining. Russia will be getting Constantinople, and possibly a great deal more in Armenia and on the Black Sea ; and until we know how much she will want and is going to get there, it is difficult to judge how much we may with reason expect her to give in Persia and elsewhere. 2. Does the same consideration apply to Afghanistan, and even Tibet? In Afghanistan the Russians have their desiderata, in Tibet (which has not been expressly mentioned by either party) we have ours. It is inconvenient to split up one Agreement by separate treatment. It will be difficult, I believe, to get the Russians to abandon their wishes in Afghanistan, for irrigation is really a serious problem for them. We cannot refuse to discuss them altogether, and it will be no answer to Russia (apart from being inexpedient) to say that we no longer want anything in libet. When are we likely to find her most amenable as regards both—when the main issue of the European war is still uncertain, and her own military and other weakness is palpable, and when, moreover, large deals in territory may be under discussion in Asia Minor at someone else’s expense ? or after the war, when she is once more secure, when past services are foigotten, and when, if it be necessary to buy her off, w T e shall have to do so at oui own expense, and may be hard put to it to find a quid pro quo ? It seems to me that primd facie the more advantageous course is to agree with our adversary whde w r e are in the way with him, and to. make a clean sw'eep of the Angio-Russian agreement at once. But there are considerations on the other side : — (a) The treatment w'hich Persia and Afghanistan are to receive after the war must depend upon their behavior during the war. How then can we agree with Russia about them till after the w r ar ? 1 ersia, perhaps, has already behaved so badly that she will need scant consideration. But the Amir has behaved extremely well, and if he maintains his neutrality to the end he will have put Russia, no less than ourselves, under obligations which it will be difficult to repay, and which we certainly cannot repay by partitioning his kingdom.\ 0 ) Again, tiie nature ol our future relations with liussia depends largely on the kind of Russia that is going to emerge from the war. The Government of India talk about impressing on the Russian Govern ment that a change in their attitude towards British interests in Asia is very desirable. So it may be. But it will not come after the war, any more than it came after the Anglo-Russian Agreement, unless there is going to be a new spirit in the Russian bureaucracy, and the old tchinovniks are sent about their business, and people are put in with whom we can deal. What are the prospects of that ? The present internal condition of Russia seems to be insecure.* Moscow rose against certain reactionar} r ministers, and they have disappeared. Is this the beginning of a really constitu tional Government ? Will it be continued and extended after the war? And whether is better for us—to revise all our agreements with the Russian Government as we know it, or to keep things going as they are and try to tide over till there is a better Russian Government ? Or, on the other hand, shall we not see, after the war, changes in the conduct of our own foreign relations, in the direction of more effective Parliamentary control, the tendency of which may be to weaken our hands in dealing with Russia in , matters not of vital importance, or the vital importance of which is not easily recognisable? (c) To return to Afghanistan—there is the obvious danger of concluding an Agreement with Russia now which must be kept secret until some time after the war ; which, if divulged or even suspected would do incalculable harm ; and to which, when the time comes, the Amir is not likely to give effect. These are weighty considerations, and though the policy of putting off the evil day is nearly always wrong, it may be held in this case that they prevail over the others, and that we should make an attempt to get the Russian Government to postpone the Afghan question, provided that, in doing so, we do not use any language that may prejudice the Tibetan question, which will some day be of great importance. But it must be expected that the Russians, looking at the matter from their own point of view, and for reasons the exact converse of ours, will resist the attempt; and in the refusal of the Amir to accept the Agreement of 1907 and their own toleration for over seven years, they have a powerful argument. II. P E R S I A. Ihe Persian question must, however, be proceeded with. What we can reasonably expect Russia to give us must, as already observed, depend partly on what she is going to get elsewhere. But there are some con- sidotations arising out of the Anglo-Russian Agreement itself which must be taken into account. Sir Richmond Ritchie, who was Political Secretary when the Agreement was negotiated, used to call it an “abdication ” ; and most of the difficulties that have since arisen have been due to the fact that His Majesty s Government, having abdicated in theory, found themselves quite unable to abdicate in practice. While securing recognition for our position in the Gulf, m Persia itself we took as our own sphere the one ✓ U'- _3 region in umcn we had no commercial interests worth speaking of (though Seistan is, ol course, capable of immense development in the future); and all that from the merchants point of view, and a good deal that from the political point of view, was most worth having, we allowed to become either Russian or neutral. Since then we have been endeavouring to evade the consequences by constantly interfering with Russia in her own sphere, and by treating the neutral sphere as though it were our own. The former was unnecessary, except in cases like the bombardment of the Meshed Shrine (and the execution of the Tabriz Mujtahids; the effects of which were felt throughout the Moslem world. But the latter was inevitable if we did not want to sacrifice the rest of our trade, and with it our political influence, and see Russia sooner or later on the shores of the Gulf. But it can hardly have been what Russia expected when she signed the Agreement, and in con sidering whether her willingness to relinquish the neutral sphere is in itself a reasonable proposition, or whether we should ask for more, it is necessary to look at it from her point of view as well as our own. From that stand point the offer must seem to her to be a sufficiently handsome one. Moreover, had she proposed to divide the neutral sphere she would have put us in a great difficulty ; for our interests are so distributed throughout its whole extent that there is literally no substantial part of it that we can afford to sacrifice. Tn fact, we are asked to sacrifice nothing except a small, but (from the Russian point of view) not unimportant area on the Afghan frontier. Yet not content with this, the Government of India want us to ask for Yezd, Ispahan, and Kermanshah. We made a present of these to Russia in 1907 ; with what eyes will she regard a request for their restoration in 1915? C ommercially they are important to her, partly because they are the principal objectives of our trade, which she wants to capture, partly because from Ispahan and 5 ezd she can eventually flood our own sphere with her bounty- fed goods. Accordingly, at Kermaushah she has done her best to throttle our trade by tolerating, if not fomenting, such disorder on the Khanikin road that our great trade via Bagdad had, for some time before the war, been practically held up at the frontier. At Ispahan she has entrenched herself strongly by characteristic measures—by the control of the Russian bank over the Zil-es-Sultan’s property, and by acquiring land through the medium of Russian-protected Persian subjects. At Yezd we do not seem to have heard of any special activity. These three places are further important to her strategically—Kermanshah as commanding the road to Bagdad and the Gulf and the oil fields at Chiah Surkh, Ispahan as commanding the Ahwaz-Gulf and Shiraz-Gulf roads, as well as the oil fields at Maidan-i-Naphtun, and Yezd as a stage towards Kerman-Seistan and Kerman-Chahbar, on the cherished Trans-Persian Railway. Ispahan is important to her politically—apart from historical reasons—as a point from which to control the Bakhtiari, who penetrate far down into our future sphere, and on 'whose loyalty we very largely depend. It is obvious that she will not lightly relinquish these advantages. For compensation we must mainly look elsewhere, since in Persia there is nothing to offer save the Zulfikar salient, and the southern environs of Ispahan and Yezd, for which Russia has already asked. This, however, though small, is not unimportant. The lines were drawn in 1907 to prevent the Russian sphere from abutting on the Afghan frontier. This is a matter of considerable importance to us politically, because we are responsible forthe Amir's relations with both Persia ami Russia. Put it is important to Russia economically to acquire the salient, because it will bring some 70 miles of the Hari Rml into her sphere, and so strengthen her hold on that river for irrigation purposes. [Jins lact showy, incidentally, that it mav be difficult to separate the Afghan from the Persian question in the negotiations.] We have therefore something to bargain with, and 1 think we might hope to get Yezd with it, if we ask for Ispahan and Kermanshah as well. It remains to consider what disadvantage we shall sulTei if these three places—or two of them—remain in Russian hands, and what safeguards w r e ought in that case to recpiire. So long as Persia is not actually partitioned, any disadvantages will he at their smallest; but partition is an eventuality for which we must be prepared. Meanw hile the worst feature is the political inconvenience that wull be caused to us through the Pakhtiari from Ispahan. For this there appears to be no remedy except, as we suggested to the Govern ment of India, to adjust the line west of Ispahan so as to bring the Bakhtiari entirely within our sphere. In this way it will be reduced to the smallest dimensions. But so long as Ispahan and Tehran (wdiere some of the leading khans spend a considerable portion of their time) are Russian, there is sure to be intrigue. Commercially, so long as there are no railways, it does not appear that we shall be much worse off, provided that order is restored, and that the Persians do not, under Russian influence, revise their customs tariff to our disadvantage, as in 1901-03. Some agreement with Russia on both these points therefore seems essential. But the advent of railways cannot be long delayed, and Russia has reserved the question of railway construction in the present neutral sphere for future consideration. From this it may perhaps be inferred that she abandons the extreme claims made in 1913 in the Trans-Persian Railway negotiations. She then opposed strongly our proposed Bunder Abbas- Shiraz-Ahwaz concession (which she suspected us of wanting to link up with the Bagdad Railway and so wrecking her own scheme), and claimed for herself the right to construct, or be predominant in, the following :— Ispahan—Shiraz. Ispahan—Ahwaz. Ispahan—Khorremabad. Yezd—Shiraz lezd—Kerman. It seems desirable, while accepting her proposal to consider railways later, to get fiom hei now a oeliinte recognition of our predominance on all these lines, as w ell as a general acceptance of a formula prohibiting discrimination on any railways in lersia. But there is one line which I incline to think that we should insist on at once as a condition of our leaving her Ispahan and Kermanshah, viz., the extension of our Mohammera-Khorremabad project to Ramadan. In practice this would mean that Russia would extend hei Julfa-Tabriz line to meet our Mohammera-Khorremabad line at its entrance to the Russian zone. If we can secure that, we are independent of the Bagdad-Khanikin-Kermanshah road. It will be opposed, but we ought to fight foi it, and, as this Office has argued before, if the Russians are genuine in their desire to co-operate with us, here is an opportunity for the joint development of the richest part of Persia.5 Two other projects must he mentionerl. (a) Any attempt to raise the Trans- Persian Railway question should be avoided. We do not want to embark on any scheme connecting India with Europe until we have seen what the new India after the war is going to be like; and we do not want to be further committed to this particular scheme until we have seen the new Russia. Further, the Ragdad Railway will now enter on a new phase ; and if it is to he completed—as I hope it will not be —it will be for consideration whether it will not give a better through connexion than the Russian scheme. (b) It must be anticipated that one of the first things the Russians will do in their own sphere when their hands are free is to construct the Askabad- Meshed line. This project has always been a bugbear to us, and one of the conditions on which we assented to the Trans-Persian principle was that it should not be constructed without a previous understanding with us. Now, by giving Russia the Zulfikar salient, we shall have made it possible for her to extend it, within her own sphere, to within measurable distance of Seistan. It seems to me that we cannot hope to succeed in blocking it for ever. It is absurd that Meshed should not sooner or later be connected with the Trans-Caspian system. And, further, I believe that in a not very remote future we may have to agree to link it up with a line of our own from the sea, because it is surely quite certain that when Central Asia is developed, access to the sea at some nearer point than Vladivostok or Constantinople will be absolutely essential to Russian interests, and we shall have to revise our own attitude towards those interests as surely as the Government of India would have Russia revise her attitude towards ours. This consideration suggests that, without mentioning the railway, we should endeavour to get Russia now to agree—in consideration of our special interests in Afghanistan—to discuss with us beforehand any undertaking contemplated in her sphere within a given distance of the Afghan frontier. In return for this we might, if necessary, agree to some joint arrangement with regard to any portion of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession which is within the Russian sphere. The Government of India very naturally point out the consequences of giving Russia a free hand in her own sphere. It will become virtually a Russian province, and the capital will always be under Russian contiol. But those conditions really exist already, and I venture to think that it is better to face the facts, and make our own arrangements in our own sphere, than to attempt to impose restrictions which Russia, even if she keeps them in the letter, will (as we shall think) break m the spmt. Suiely we know enough now to realize that it is idle to talk of making icvival of I trsia possible.” The happiness and prosperity of the people of that unfortunate country depend, so far as can be foreseen, upon administiation which onl) outside control—whether directly or indirectly exercised--can secure. A scheme for such control ought to be part of our settlement, not onlj in the interest of the people, but as a means of obviating friction between ouiselves and Russia. Probably it would take the form of Inspectors-General, Russian and British, in our respective spheres. The conclusions seem to be :— ( 1 ) That there is something to be said for endeavouring to reserve the Afghan question for consideration after the war, but that it will be difficult to do so, partly because it is really important to Russia, partly because the re-alignment of the Russian sphere in 1 ersia itself in\ol\es it.

No differential rates, &amp;c., on any Persian railwajs. (ih) Any proposed undertaking in the Russian sphere in the neighbourhood of the Afghan frontier to be the subject of joint discussion. {d) Concert with Russia a scheme for the joint control of Persian Note on the Persian Question by General Sir Edmund Barrow. The necessity of coming to an agreement with Russia on this subject without delay is obvious, as once Russia is in possession of Con stantinople she will be the less ready to make concessions to us. That being so, the immediate point for consideration is what factors are vital ones for us. The first and supreme factor in the problem is the maintenance of our absolute supremacy in the Persian Gulf. The second great factor is the recognition of the claims we are establishing to the political control of Mesopotamia, i.e., of ihe Baghdad-Basra region, and with it of the Karim Valley and the Anglo-Persian oil-fields. The third essential factor is the inclusion in our sphere of the whole of the Bakhtiari region. Finally, there is the consideration that the further oil’ we can keep Russia and Russian influence the better for us from a military point of view. The first of the above material factors compels us to include not only the whole of the provinces of Kerman and Ears in our own sphere * t * This will give us Burujird. which is better than nothing if we cannot get our railway through to Hamadan./ but also Arabistan. whilst the second and third factors call aloud for the inclusion of the whole of Khuzistan and Luiistan. With those provinces in our complete possession or under our undisputed political influence we may, I think, be said to have secured for ourselves all military and strategical points essential to us. We shall have entire control of the Gulf and the oilfields and of Persian Seistan, and we shall dominate all possible railway lines approaching India and Afghanistan, except of course the one through Herat. 1 here is, however, still the consideration that the further we can keep Russia away the better ; and therefore, as Sir Arthur Hirtzel proposes, we should endeavour to include Yezd and Ispahan in our sphere in the West, and, as the Viceroy suggests, Ghain (Kain) and Birjand on the East. Indeed, I am not at all sure that we should not also include Tun and 'babas, which are important oases and might be useful outposts in the great desert which protects our sphere on the North. However, I should be quite content if we got Birjand and Ghain and Yezd ; for it seems to me highly improbable that Russia would agree to surrendering Ispahan, which by the Anglo- Russian agreement of 1907 was so lightly abandoned to Russia. Ghain and Birjand are really more important than Yezd, for the reason that if we are at war with Russia the main Russian line of attack must be via Herat, in which case a developed Seistan may have a first-rate importance for us as a flanking position, which again might attract an attack through Birjand. Lord Curzon’s memorandum on the defence of Seistan, written about 1902 or 1903, explains clearly the importance of Seistan and its approaches. III. AFGHANISTAN AND TIBET. In case it is found necessary to take up the questions of Afghanistan and Tibet in the near future, it would seem desirable to arrive at some conclusion without delay as to the policy we are to adopt. As regards Tibet, the position is that a “ tripartite ” (Anglo-Sino-Tibetan) Convention was negotiated in India last year, but has remained inoperative owing to the refusal of the Chinese to sign. The terms of this Convention, which had been initialled by the three plenipotentaries on the 27th April, were communicated to the Russian Government in May 1914. I hough described by M. Sazonow as “ abrogating ( and again as virtually tearing up ”) the Tibetan section of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, the new instrument, in point of fact, affects the 190&lt; Agreement at two points only, viz. :— (1.) Article 6 of the Convention renders necessary the rescission of the “ self-denying ordinances ” contained in Article 4 of of the 1907 Agreement under which (treat Britain and Russia undertook to seek no concessions in Tibet; (2.) Article 8 , giving the British Trade Agent at Gyantse the right of access to Lhasa under certain conditions, conflicts with Article 3 of the Agreement, under which both Russia and Gieat Britain engaged not to send representatives to Lhasa.' 8 \fter ci good dool of discussion llic iiussiuii (dovciniiH hi on tiic i.itii Mu^ 1Q24: expressed tlieir willingness to ciccept tlio Con\ention subjec t to one modification, on the following conditions (1.) Article 6 .—The British and Russian Governments to engage, by an exchange of notes published simultaneously with the Convention, not to ask for concessions for their respective subjects without previous mutual understanding. The Russian Government to engage in a secret note not to ask for concessions for Russian subjects nor to oppose any request by His Majesty’s Government for concessions in favour of British subjects. (2.) Article 8 .—The Britisli Government to engage, by an exchange of published notes, not to put this Article into force without previous agreement with Russia. The latter to engage, by a secret note, to raise no objection to the Gyantse Trade Agent proceeding to Lhasa, whenever it should be thought necessary for him to do so, on the understanding that he must retain the character of a commercial, not a political, agent. (3.) Great Britain to address a note to Russia engaging “ not to support any demand on the part of British subjects for irrigation works, “ railways, or any preferential rights for commercial or industrial “ enterprises in Northern Afghanistan.” M. Sazonow subsequently agreed to the immediate signature of the Convention, provided the British Government at once addressed an official note to him engaging not to give effect to Articles C and 8 without a previous understanding with Russia. His Majesty s Government agreed to the third of the Russian conditions'^', subject to the stipulation that “Northern Afghanistan ” should be defined, by means of an interchange of secret notes, in the manner desired by the Government of India T ; but M. Sazonow demurred altogether to the proposed definition, mainly because the area defined did not include the Hari Rud, the most important river of all for the purposes of Trans-Caspian irrigation. He also piessed for the publication of the definition. ^ n out &lt; uly 1914 the Chinese finally declined to sign the Tibet Convention, and, as a consequence, the negotiations with Russia were suspended. We informed the Russian Government on 11 th July of what had happened and undertook to consult them before acting upon any of the provisions of the Convention that conflicted with the 1907 Agreement. It must be added that, quite independently of the Tibet negotiations, the Russian Government in May 1914 called attention to the urgent need, in the interests of Russian Transcaspia, of the construction of irrigation works on the Russo-Afghan frontier. They also formulated definite proposals b\ which the water needed for the scheme was to be drawn entirely from Afghan territory, and invited His Majesty’s Government to a joint^(fecf^rati^on 8 by^ vq 11 Gc^ernments^Tn wMcrR^ 6111 Sh ° Uld ^ &amp;S f that Afghanistan is outside the sphere of her Mdcal IXenee^ tXr r agreed to the proposed reaffirmation. political influence.

The Afghan question has since been revived by the Russian Govern ment in connection with the discussion of the ultimate terms of peace. A memorandum by the Russian Ambassador dated 22nd March 1915, after enumerating the Russian desiderata for a general settlement, ended with the following paragraphEnfin le Gouvernement Imperial considere qu’il “ serait desirable qu'en meme temps les questions du nord de TAfghanistan, “ limitrophe avec la Russie, regoivent une solution dans I’esprit de desirs “ exprimes a ce sujet par le Gouvernement Imperial an cours des pour- “ parlers de 1’annee derniere.” The telegrams to and from the Government * To Government of India, dated 8th India on the Russian proposal are May domditto, dated 13th Mav 1915. P'' 16 / , in A PP endix B - Mow - As To ditto, dated 17th May 1915. regards irrigation a draft formula was From ditto, dated 10th June 1915. prepared in the India Office, and accepted by the Government of India in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 10 th June 1915, as suitable for proposal to the Russian Government. This formula is printed in the first column of Appendix C. It is to be doubted, however, whether the formula, as it stands, will satisfy the Russian Government. It must be remembered that Russia has asked us not only ( 1 ) to make arrangements to meet her own irrigational needs, but ( 2 ) formally to disinterest ourselves in all commercial (including irrigational) enterprises in “ Northern Afghanistan.” The draft formula (though it contains the phrase “ Northern x\fghanistan ”) is silent on point ( 2 ) ; and while we should be glad enough to see this point tacitly dropped, we must be prepared for the Russians to press it. If they do, and if it is found necessary to meet their vdshes, our object should be to give the required undertaking in such a form as will be least calculated to arouse the Amir’s suspicions or to convey any suggestion of a partition of Afghanistan, or of its division into “spheres of influence,” commercial or otherwise. With this object the draft formula might be modified as shown in the second column of Appendix C., the effect being ( 1 ) to introduce the renunciation required of us incidentally, and as a subsidiary point, into a document primarily dealing with a practical question of irrigation rights, in which Russia and Afghanistan are clearly the only parties interested ; and (2) to make it apply, not to “ Northern Afghanistan ” or to any defined section of the Amir’s Kingdom, but merely to certain specified rivers, all of which flow r through Russian as well as Afghan territory. It should be noted that, even under the revised formula, our renunciation will cover irrigation projects only, to the exclusion of “ railways or any preferential rights for commercial or industrial enterprises ” mentioned by M. Sazonow in May 1914. But, as irrigation is the Russians’ main concern — and probably the only one in which they are genuinely interested—they would perhaps be ready to accept a compromise on the lines indicated. It is important, if w^e come to terms with Russia about Tibet, to get rid of the elaborate machinery of “ secret ” and “published ” notes favoured by M. Sazonow last year, and to obtain instead a plain intimation from Russia that she accepts the Tibet Convention and is willing to regard Article 4 of the 1907 Agreement as having lapsed, so far as concessions to British subjects are concerned. S. 273.i USSO-A FG HAN FRONTIER. Islands in the Onus. Another Afghan question still outstanding is that of certain islands in the river Oxus on the Russo-Afghan frontier. . The settlement of 1872-3, known as the 1 Clarendon-Ccortchakoff Agreement,” which was negotiated between Great Britain and Russia without reference to the Amir, fixed the Oxus as the northern boundary of Afghanistan from Lake Victoria or Wood’s Lake (about long. &lt;3 50 ) in the East to Khoja Saleh (about long. 00° 10') in the West. No special provision was made for regulating the ownership of enclaves or islands in the river itself; but it seems to have been assumed on our side that what the Government of India describe (letter of 20th April 1905) as the old and “ general rule by which the deep stream constitutes the boundai\ of jurisdiction and ownership ’ would be applied thiougheut. The Yangi Kila case.—Yangi Kila is an island some 20 miles in length, situated in about long. 70°. The locality was visited by Lieutenant J. Wood, of the Indian Navy, in 1838, while employed with Captain Burnes’ mission to Afghanistan; but our information regarding the whole tract is extiemeL meagre. The strategic possibilities of the island were discussed by the Government of India in June 1914 in the following terms “ It would appear that the proximity of the island of I angi Kila to the Chubek-Sarnti ferry gives it a certain military value in view of ihe iact that the Russians have a road from Termez along the right bank of the Oxus to Chubek-Samti ferry, linking up Kulab, a place of some importance in Bokhara, with the Khawak and other passes over the Hindu Kush via Talikhan and Deh Saleh. The island could thus be made use of for facili tating the passage of the Upper Oxus by a small Russian force, detailed either to make a secondary advance towards the Hindu Kush, or to create a diversion in Badakhshan via Faizabad on the.Kokcha river in the direction of Ohiga Sarai on the Kunar river. In view of these possibilities it would be to our interest to secure the island, if possible, for the Amir as an admitted part of Afghan territory.” It appears that the main stream of the Oxus formerly ran south of Yangi Kila, but has in recent years been diverted to the North. The owner ship of the island lias in consequence been the subject of dispute, and at one time (1904) both Russian and Afghan guards were in occupation. No actual collision occurred, however, and the Russians subsequently withdrew. The Amir placed the case before Mr. Dane at Kabul in February 1905, but His Majesty’s Government thought the moment inopportune for raising the question with Russia. Nothing more was heard of the dispute until February 1914, when the Amir again addressed the Viceroy on the subject, asking for His Excellency’s good offices in effecting a settlement. He argued that the Russians could not expect to have it both ways; and that, as they had claimed accretions of territory consequent upon southerly diversions of the Oxus, they ought to allow corresponding advantages to Afghanistan when the channel wasdiverted northwards. ' in a subsequent letter (1'Jtti August lUi4j the Amir mentioned two other tracts, in regard to which similar disputes had arisen, WVL - • 0 ) ^ ie forest of Bandar-i-kam Saligh in Kattaghan, and ( 2 ) the tract of land and foiest in the hed of the river situated in Uazrat-i-Imamsahib (or saiyid), opposite Saiai k.amar-i-I\hanja,'j' both of which he claimed as Afghan territory. The Viceroy replied (19th October 1914) that His Majesty’s Government would he in a better position to take .up the case with Russia if they were possessed of accurate local information ; he accordingly Sll gg (, sted that a small British mission, including a survey officer, should proceed to the Oxus and there make a full examination of these tracts and of any othei tiucts m the vicinity that may become the subject of dispute.^ the Amir leplied on the 28th April 1915 that, in view of the preoccupations of Great Britain and Russia elsewhere, he would not press for further action ; he added that his officers would be instructed to do nothing likely to cause disturbance. 11 the question is now to be raised with the Russian Government, our object should presumably be ( 1 ) to obtain their assent to the general principle that the main current of the river, for the time being, forms the frontier; and (2) to induce them to admit the Amir’s claims to Yangi Kda and the other tracts mentioned in his letter of the 19th August 1914. If difficulties are made about ( 2 ), it may be necessary, after the war, to revive the suggestion of a British mission to investigate locally. Incidentally, such a mission would have valuable geographical results (the region being almost unknown), apart from the military and political intelligence which our officers might be expected to collect. But it is very doubtful whether the Amir would consent. V. CHINESE TURKESTAN: THE HUNZA QUESTION. A further question, upon which (though outside the scope of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907) an understanding with Russia might be desirable, is that of the Hunza boundary. Stated very briefly, the situation in regard to Hunza (which is a small hill state situated to the extreme north-west of Kashmir, in the region “ where three Empires meet,” he., where the British, Russian, and Chinese frontiers in Central Asia converge towards a single point) is as follow’s :— The Chief (or “Mir”) of Hunza, who is a tributary of the Maharaja of Kashmir, has certain rather vague “rights of occupancy” over tracts known as Raskam and the Taghdumbash Pamir, in the Chinese district of Sarikol (Chinese Turkestan). On the other hand, China claims (and the claim derives some colour from the periodical exchange of presents between the Mir and the Chinese authorities at Kashgar, wuth which we * “ In the vicinitv of Shighnan the river has changed its course towards Afghan territory, and the land left on the other side of the water is regarded by the Russians as theirs; while, in the vicinity of Yangi Kila, the river has changed its course towards Russian territory, and the land left on this side of the water is also regarded by the Russians as Russian territory. Then what is the boundary line, and what is the meaning of the boundary settlement ? ”— Amir to Viceroy, 17th February 1914. t flazrat-i- Imam sahib is situated in about long. 69°; Bandar-i-Kam Saligh cannot be traced on the map. Roth tracts are in the Kattaghan (Kunduz) district.■ have not thought fit to interfere) to exercise “ concurrent jurisdiction ” of a shadowy sort over Hunza itself. The Hunza-Ohina border has never been delimited; but an excellent “ natural ” frontier is afforded by the main watershed of the Mustagh rano-e. In 1899 we made definite proposals to China for the settlement of die whole question, on the basis of (l) surrender by Hunza of practically all rights beyond the watershed, and (2) Chinese relinquishment of all claims in respect of Hunza itself, dhe Chinese Government, however, did not respond to our advances, and the mattei v\as allowed to drop. The position has been complicated in the past by the attitude of Russia, who in 1899 professed to sec, in our advocacy of Hunza rights in Raskam, an attempt to outflank the Russian position in the Pamirs. There is the further consideration that sooner or later, whether we like it or not, Russia is likely to absorb Chinese Turkestan. She already dominates the Sarikol district from her post at Tashkurghan; and until quite recently the process of further absorption appeared to be developing very rapidly. The Tashkurghan post was strengthened in 1911, and in the following year local disturbances at Kashgar were made the pretext for reinforcing the Russian Consular Guard ; while the unceasing activity displayed by Russian officials at both places made it evident, as the Government of India reported in duly 1912, that a policy of '‘peaceful penetration ” was being vigorously pursued and was likely, if unchecked, to end in permanent occupation. On the other hand, M. Sazonow, during his visit to England in the autumn of 1912, declared categorically to Lord Crewe that Russia had no wish to take over the administration of Chinese Turkestan, and would make no move in any part of the province without first informing His Majesty’s Government. Since 1912, the situation has been quieter and local Russian activities less conspicuous ; but the prospect of ultimate Russian occupation remains. Chinese pretensions in flunza matter little so long as China is the claimant, but might prove very embarrassing if transferred to Russia ; it is, therefore, desirable to dispose finally of them before Russia steps into Chinas shoes in Chinese Turkestan. For this purpose, however, our first requirement is an agreement with China, not with Russia ; the most that we could ask of the latter at this stage would be ( 1 ) a repetition, in more formal teims, of M. Sazonow s assurances of 1912, and ( 2 ) a generally bene\ r olent attitude towards our negotiations with China. Neither of these desiderata is veg\ substantial, and on the whole there seems little to be gained by raising the Hunza question in the present connection. India Office. August 191f).13 APPENDICES. APPENDIX A. Telegrams relating to Persia. No. 1 . From Viceroy, 23rd March 1915. f Extract.) As regards Persia, if she maintains nominal neutrality, we consider that our interests will be best served if Russia can be induced, in return for important concessions elsewhere, to relax her hold on Northern Persia and to give Persia a chance to revive. Russian retirement from Northern Persia at our instance would inspire confidence in Moslem world, and would save us from serious additional military and civil obligations involved in partition. If, however, Persia definitely goes into the war against us, eventual partition would appear only course open, and such partition might follow a line from about Yazdan (Sharakhs) on east, passing just south of Yazd to Yazd-i-Khast, thence through Madraseh to Khoramabad and thence along the boundary of the Russian zone to near Kasr-i-Shirin. In the event of partition being inevitable, this should be our claim, but it will require more careful consideration in detail than we have been able to give it within the last few days. No. 2. From Secretary of State fur India to l iceroy, 2dth March 1915. (Extract.) Line proposed in penultimate paragraph of your telegram of 23rd March . seems to cut Bakhtiari in two. In any eventual partition or readjustment of spheres Bakhtiari should, if possible, be entirely in our sphere. Any new demarcation line should not be mere line on map but should follow easily recognisable natural features such as watersheds. Please consider further in this sense, and propose two lines one including, the other excluding, ^ Ispahan. No. 3. From Viceroy, \i)lh April 1915. Reference to latter portion of your telegram of the 29th March last. Partition of Persia. We wish it clearly understood that we put forward partition as an unwelcome necessity in the event of Persia forsaking her neutrality, and regard additional responsibilities entailed, vague and undefined as they are, with utmost diffidence. Partition and spheres of influence are two entirely different propositions, and we sincerely trust that former may be avoided. Subject to these remarks, we propose following alternative lines :— (l.) Including Ispahan. We propose as our northern limit province of Kain, southern salient of Khorasan, provinces of Yazd, Ispahan, Bakhtiari, and Luristan. In this case our strategic requirements are hills surrounding Kain, Birjand, and extending to Afghan border, high headland around Naiband, hills north and north-east of Yazd, commanding roads from Meshed and Asterabad, high ground running north-westward from Nain to about Natanz, including Kashan if possible, but in any case running westward S. 273. D!' along watershed toKhimsaron border of llaklitian count 13 , thence folJoA\ ing ground north-west to DauJatabad , thence *\(st\\aid to l\.asii-Shiim, including Ivermanshah if possible, but otheiuise following natural features nearest to tribal border. (2.) Line excluding Ispahan. We propose as our northern limit provinces of Kain Kerman, southern portion of Yazd including Yazd City, Fars, Bakhtiari, including Luristan. Our strategical requirements would be the same as regards Birjand, Kain, and Naiband, whence line should follow' hills north of Yazd, as in former alternative, to south of Salt Lake, namely, south of Burneh Chah to Yazd-i-Khast. whence it would follow' hill crests on Bakhtiari border north-west to Daulatabad, thence to Kasri-i-Shirin as in former alternative. The first line including Ispahan would be easier to hold on account of better desert frontier obtained north of Ispahan. For administrative purposes it is desirable that line of partition should follow' as far as possible existing provincial boundaries. It will be noticed that we propose to bring eastern starting point of line from Zulfikar southward to the north boundary of Kain. The inclusion of Zulfikar would make our frontier a salient equidistant between Russian bases of Kushk and Meshed, and consequently our military position at Zulfikar would be precarious. It would be objected that by abandoning Zulfikar we leave Russia coterminous with Herat border west as well as north, but to all practical purposes she is so already, and military considerations appear paramount.

Speaking generally, w'e cannot jP fhmkmg that proposed great concessions to Russia in Constantinople and the Straits are by no means balanced by any advantage to us which we can discern in these proposals, and we regard with concern the omission of Mesopotamia, which apart from its own special importance certainly cannot be divorced strategically from Persian question.

As regards railway questions, we would suggest inclusion of paragraph reserving to ourselves right of veto on any project of strategical importance and in any case right to have majority, including military representative on boai d oi control on all railways outside Russian sphere. As regards Russia’s demands for liberty of action in her own sphere we realise that while this would be difficult to combat, it means eventual complete Russification of Northern Persia, and eventual establishment of Russian province coterminous with our sphere. The fact that the capital of 1 ersia would be within this province makes this development even more undesirable. Were it possible, we should infinitely prefer a self-denying ordinance on both sides limiting the introduction of troops and amount of administrative interference in our respective spheres. This alone would make revival of 1’ersia possible. Failing this, however, we should insist upon similar freedom of action in British sphere if we should in future find such a course necessary. Finally, wo are of opinion that the moment has come to impress upon Russian Grovernment that a change in their attitude towards British interests in Asia is very desirable; and. that while India, standing side by side with Great Britain and her Colonies, is supporting the Franco-Russian Alliance in five theatres of war to the very utmost of her strength and resources, and is even assisting to obtain Russian predominance in Constantinople and the Dardanelles, she has the right to expect Indian interests in Asia to be fairly and even generously treated, and without creating needless difficulties in Afghanistan, Tibet, and elsewhere. For it can only be upon a basis of equity and confidence, with a due regard to neutral interests of each, that the future peace of Asia can be securely maintained and controlled by British and Russian Governments.16 APPENDIX B. T ELEC HAMS RELATING TO TlBET AND AFGHANISTAN. No. 1. From Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Sth May 1915. (Extract.) Amono- Russian desiderata in connection with eventual peace nego tiations Is one to effect that questions affecting Northern Afghanistan should be solved in accordance with their wishes expressed last year in connection with Tibet. Foreign Office ask for my views and suggest that, in view of persistent refusal of Chinese to sign Convention, Russian acceptance of it is no longer worth purchasing at the price proposed. Please telegraph your views. Presumably Japanese action in China does not make it easier for us to disinterest ourselves m I ibet, and may lie a point which we can use in our favour with Russia. Quite apart from Tibetan negotia tions it may be expected that after war Russians will revive Oxus irrigation scheme, see my telegram dated 9th June 1914, and repeat complaints about Hari Rud and Murghab. No. 2 . From Viceroy, 13th May 1915. Your telegram dated Sth May. Russian desiderata. Our interests in Tibet are for the time being safeguarded by Anglo-Tibetan Declaration, and there appears no prospect of China signing Convention in near future. 1 therefore strongly deprecate any concession whatever to Russia as price of her prospective consent to Convention on the chance of its eventually being signed by China. Apart from this, if Amir maintains his present attitude in face of strong counter influences, we shall be under considerable obligations to him at end of war, as also will Russia. Any Anglo-Russian Declaration immediately after war regarding Northern Afghanistan could only result in arousing liveliest suspicions in Afghanistan, where public opinion is already considerably exercised by our alliance with Russia. Such Declaration, however harmless, would be regarded as act of perfidy and menace to integrity of Afghanistan and inevitably estrange Amir. Further, as a matter of actual fact, it must be obvious to Russia that we have no intention or prospect of doing anything in Northern Afghanistan in regard to irrigation, railways, Ac., when we cannot even in Southern Afghanistan construct the railways or telegraphs which we desire to. At the same time we are quite prepared, after the conclusion of war, to attempt to induce the Amir, if necessary by means of a mission, to remove such commercial and other inconveniences as Russia has reason to complain of at present, and generally to improve Russo-Afghan relations on the northern frontier. As regards Oxus irrigation scheme we must adhere to views expressed in our telegram of 22 nd July 1914, that Russian Government should fully explain necessity lor choosing Afghan territory for construction of proposed works before subject can be again considered/ No. 3.

We see no objection to draft formula forwarded with Political Secretary’s letter dated 14th May, on the distinct understanding that it is to be kept absolutely secret until some time after the conclusion of the war. If the Amir were given reason to think now that we were arranging with Russia to interfere as soon as the war was over with internal irrigation arrangements in Afghanistan his liveliest suspicions would be aroused, and it is quite possible that this might induce him to give way to surrounding influences and abandon his attitude of neutrality. Delicacy of Afghan situation cannot be over-rated, and we most earnestly deprecate anything likely to upset the equilibrium. As regards formula itself, wording appears suitable, but fact must be faced that Amir is not at all likely at any time to agree to Commission, or should he do so to surrender even the smallest of his rights except possibly for very ample compensation. In order, however, to silence Russian demands for the present, we agree proposed formula might be used on condition of its secrecy as above explained.18 APPENDIX C. Draft Formula relating to Afghanistan. I. As accepted by Government of India in Viceroy's telegram of \Dth June 1915.

In their investigations and suggestions the Commis sion shall be debarred from questioning any rights of the Afghan Government and its subjects in the water supply of these rivers that were recognised by the Boundary Com mission.

Irrigation Rights on Russo-Afghan Frontier. I. Extracts from Anglo-Russian Protocol of 26tli December J 88 f&gt; (N.S.) [i.) I he Russia-n Commissioner gave his adhesion to this arrangement Lt.e boundary line in neighbourhood of Chihil Dukhteran] on condition that it should come into force at the same time that it might be agreed that Russia (1) has the light, if she thinks proper, to construct a dam across the Murghab at the place chosen by her below the head of the Rund-i-Nadir canal ; and ( 2 ) shall receive in that case, on the right bank of the Mur^hab, a piece of land which shall be agreed upon as being sufficient for carrying out the work. (n.) 1 he question of the irrigation of the Ivushk and Kashan valley was raised by M. Lessar. . . . After the discussion which ensued, it was agreed that in the two above-mentioned sections [viz., Kushk valley between Ohihil Dukhteian and Ivara lappa Khurd, and Kashan valley between Torsekh and dam below Robat-i-Kashan] the Afghans should not have the right to increase the number or extent of the canals in actual use; but as regards the above-named canals [i.e., apparently, the Kashan and Jiund-i- Nadir canals] that, provided that condition was observed, they should retain the use and absolute control of them without interference. (iii.) It was further agreed that the want of water, no matter from what cause it arose, in the canals which flow into Russian territory, but of which the heads are in Afghan territory, shall not justify claims on the part of Russia. II. — Extracts from Anglo-Russian Protocol of 22nd duly 1887 (N.S .) 0 : — Clause 3.—The clause in the Protocol of the 2Gth December 1885, pro hibiting the Afghans from making use of the irrigating canals in the Kushk Valley below Chihil Dukhteran which were not in use at that time, remains in force, but it is understood that this clause can only be applied to the canals supplied by the Kushk. The Afghans shall not have the right to make use of the waters of the Kushk for their agricultural works north of Chihil Dukhteran; but the waters of the'Moghur belong exclusively to them, and they may carry out any works they may think necessary in order to make use of them. Clause 4.—The clauses in the Protocols of the 26th December 1885, and of the 13th September 1886,| relative to the construction of a dam on the Murghab, remain in force. M. Zinoview having expressed the wish that the obligation imposed on the Amir of Afghanistan to give up for this purpose a tract of land on the right bank of the Murghab under the conditions stipulated in the said protocols, should be extended to the whole course of the river below the canal-head of Yaki-Yuz, Colonel Ridgeway is of opinion that the necessary steps to obtain the assent of the Amir might delay the conclusion of the present arrangement; but he is never theless convinced that the assent of the Amir to the cession, under the same conditions, of a tract of land on the right bank can be obtained without difficulty, if later on the Imperial Government should inform Her Britannic Majesty’s Government of their intention of proceeding to the construction of a dam above the canal-head of Bund-i-Nadir. * * The Protocol of 22nd July 1887 embodied the final agreement between the British and Russian Commissioners for the delimitation of the Rnsso-Afghan Frontier t The protocol of 13th September 1886 merely fixed the limits of the “ piece of land ” referred to in extract (i) from the protocol of 26th December 1885. [t’.T.O.20 JH —Extracts from Anglo-Russian Protocol of 3rd September 1803 (N.S.)* : Clause 3 .—In order to elucidate and complete Clause 3 of the Protocol of 22 nd July 1887, the Commissioners have established that the Afghans shall not be able to take off water from the river Kushk, north of the ruins of the Chihil Dukhteran bridge (Pul-i-Khishti), for irrigation by means of either new or disused or closed canals, the Afghans shall not have the right to carry on, below the parallel of Chihil Dukhteran Frontier Pillar Xo. 23, for irrigation, the branches of the canals which take off from the Kushk south of the ruins of the Chihil Dukhteran bridge (Pul-i-Khishti), but they shall have the right to make use of the said branches to irrigate their cultivation as far as the parallel of the Chihil Dukhteran Frontier Pillar No. 23. The Afghans shall also have the right to the free use for irrigation or any other purpose of the waters of springs which exist on the left bank of the Kushk between the hills and the river to the south of the Karatappa Frontier Pillar No. 22 , up to the points where the springs reach the stream of the river. To the south of the ruins of Chihil Dukhteran bridge (Pul-i-Khisti) the Afghans have full rights to all the water of the Kushk, and shall not be subject to any restriction whatever. Clause 4.—The want of water in the Kushk, no matter from whatever cause arising, provided that the Afghans maintain the stipulations of Clause 3 of the Protocol of 22nd July 1887, and the arrangements above set forth, cannot give cause for further claims on the part of the Russian authorities. ♦ This protocol was drawn up by a Commission appointed “ to enquire into on the spot u a ? d se J tle tlie question of the alleged infractions, which may have been committed by either V.u on tj 16 /^^Jations reiating to the waters of the Kushk,” as contained in the Protocol ot the ^Jnd July 1887.

Stli ulth b^- Reference to concluding sentence of your telegram ol ic stn uitnno. Russian Meinoranduin relating to Persia. Speaking eneiallv, \\e cannot help thinking that proposed great concessions to Russia in ( onstantinople and the Straits are by no means balanced by any advantage to us which we can discern in these proposals, and we regard with concern the omission of Mesopotamia, which apart from its own special importance certainly cannot be divorced strategically from Persian question. \\ e think that this opportunity mm nut be taken to define our claims in that region, particularly as the reference to sacred places, as it stands, might be held to exclude us from some portions of Euphrates \ alley and in any case to restrict our freedom of action. As regards actual Persian proposal (1) For reasons explained in my telegram of 19th April, we recommend concession to Russia of the portion of Zullikar salient that lies outside province of Kain. (2) As regards Ispahan and 'l azd, we consider that for strategic reasons stated in our telegram of 19th April, it is desirable that both these places should be definitely included in our sphere together with natural features to the north-east, north, and north-west of these localities. Further without Yazd and Ispahan our commercial position in Southern Persia will not be materially improved, while politically it is obviously undesirable that we should have on the borders of our zone two large and important centres of Russian influence, which might become foci of intrigue. Moreover, Bakhtiari interests are intimately bound up with Ispahan. Our claim to Ispahan and \azd should be balanced against our concession at Zullikar, but if it is impossible to obtain both, we should prefer to insist upon the re linquishment by Russia of Ispahan, because it controls the Bakhtiari country, tribes, and interests, has the shorter and better line of communication with our base on the sea, is the terminus of the Lynch road, is better placed for securing our Mesopotamian and oil interests against pressure from the c aet, and would enable us to operate with better effect against any advance south ward from the Caspian. As regards railway questions, we would suggest inclusion of paragraph reserving to ourselves right of veto on any project ol strategical importance, and in any case right to have majority, including military representative, on board of control on all railways outside Russian sphere. As regards Russia’s demands for liberty of action in her own sphere, we realise that while this would be difficult to combat, it means eventual complete Russification of Northern Persia, and eventual establishment ol Russian province coterminous with our sphere. I he fact that the capital of Persia would be within this province makes this development even more undesirable. Were it possible, we should infinitely prefei a self-denying ordinance on both sides limiting the introduction of troops and amount of administrative interference in our respective spheres. Ibis alone would make revival of Persia possible. Failing this, however, we should insist upon similar freedom of action in British sphere it we should in future find such a course necessary. Finally, we are of opinion that the moment has come to impress upon Russian Government that a change in their attitude towards British interests in Asia is very desirable; and that while India, standing side by side with Great Britain and her Colonies is supporting the Franco Russian Alliance in five theatres of war to the very utmost of her strength and resources, and is even assisting to obtain Russian predominance in &lt; ’onstantinople and the Dardanelles, she has the right to expect Indian interests in Asia to be fairly and even generously treated, and without creating needless difficulties in Afghanistan, Tibet and elsewhere. For it can only be upon a basis of •onfidence with a due regard to neutral interests ol each, that of Asia can be securely maintained and controlle equity and the future peaceDRAFT TELEGRAM SECRETARY OF STATE VICEROY, FOREIGN DEPARTM (Retamilla)Minute Paper.

Our strategical requirements would’ be the same t,s regards B.rjand, Kain, and Naiband, whence line should lollow hills north of Yazd as in former alternative, to south of Salt Lake namelj, south ol Bmneh (.halt to Vazd-i-khast, whence it would follow hill crests on Ihikhtian border north west to Daulatahad, thence to Kasri-Shirin as m former alternative. ^mrni The first line including Ispahan would be easier to hold on account of bettei desert frontier obtained north of Ispahan. For administrative purposes it is desirable that hue of partition should follow as far as possible existing provincial boundaries. It will be noticed that we propose to brine eas ern starting point of hue from Zullikar southward to the north boundary ol Lain. I he inclusion ot Zuliikar would make our frontier a salient equidistant between Russian bases of Kushk and .Meshed, and consequenily our military position at Zulfikar would be precarious. It would be objected ilial by abandoning Zulfikar we leave Russia coterminous with Herat border west as well as north, but to all practical purposes she is so already and military considerations appear paramount.

The memorandum discusses in great detail British interests regarding Persia, Afghanistan, Tibet, the Russo-Afghan frontier, and the Hunza boundary. On the subject of Persia, the memorandum discusses possible rearrangements of the Russian and neutral spheres of Persia in favour of British strategic interests. Regarding Tibet and Afghanistan, the memorandum recounts meetings between the British and Russian Governments, following the completion of the Tibet Convention [between Britain, China and Tibet, completed on 27 April 1914, but not signed by China], in which Britain sought Russia's acceptance of the Convention, and in return agreed not to support any demand made by British subjects for irrigations works, railways, or any commercial or industrial enterprises in Northern Afghanistan.Appended to the memorandum are copies of telegrams between the Viceroy of India [Charles Hardinge] and the Secretary of State for India [Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes], a draft formula between Britain and Russia regarding Afghanistan, and extracts from Anglo-Russian protocols relating to irrigation rights on the Russo-Afghan frontier (dated 1885, 1887 and 1893 respectively).In addition to the memorandum, this part of the volume includes the following:remarks from General Edmund George Barrow (Military Secretary, India Office) regarding rearrangements of the spheres in Persia;two sketch maps of Persia showing suggested lines of demarcation;copies of telegrams from Sir George William Buchanan, Ambassador to Petrograd [Saint Petersburg], to the Foreign Office, recounting meetings in Petrograd with the Russian Minister at Tehran, on the subject of a new agreement regarding Persia;copies of telegrams from the British Minister at Tehran, Charles Murray Marling, to the Foreign Office, reporting on a press campaign in Persia in favour of abrogation of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907.The French material in this part of the volume consists of a short quotation from a memorandum from the Russian Ambassador, which appears in the Political and Secret Department memorandum mentioned above.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Military Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100034285662.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
