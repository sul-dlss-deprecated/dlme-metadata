Crown Prince of the Yemen in conversation with Seager referred indirectly to this subject by saying that the Yemen wished to ? import armaments for which it had applied to His Majesty*s Government in addition to what was coining from other sources.

(E 4f^4/llC/91) &lt;- O rH 4031 ! , I959 j r s&gt;' The French Ambassador, in his memorandum No- 259 of the 19th May, was so good as to communicate to Lord Halifax the views of the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs with regard to the question of Shaikh Said, and to enclose the text of a draft agreement with the King of the Yemen. Monsieur Corbin requested that he might be informed of the views of Lord Halifax on the document and also enquired whether the Foreign Office would be disposed to use their influence with the King of the Yemen with a View to persuading His Majesty to sign an agreement on ohe lines proposed. 2. Lord Halifax has now considered the French Ambassador’s memorandum and the draft agreement enclosed therein. He will be grateful if His Excellency will inform the French Government that His Majesty’s Government v G..come their readiness to declare that they have no intention of raising the question of Shaikh Said so long as the King of the Yemen continues to occupy Shaikh Said effectively, and refrains from ceding, leasing or mortgaging any part of his territory or entrusting its defence, either expressly or tacitly, to a third Power, The proposed declaration is in entire accordance with the declaration which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have themselves made in the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April, 1938, regarding certain areas in the Middle East, 3. The French Ministry for Foreign Affairs may, however,/ —however, wish to consider the desirability of omitting the last paragraph of the draft agreement. This clause provides that His Majesty the King of the Yemen is to take note of the French Government's declaration, and is to express his acquiescence in its substance. It is not understood what practical advantage there would be in endeavouring to persuade the King of the Yemen to sign a statement on these lines. Its omission would, it is true, alter the form of the document, which, instead of being a bilateral agreement between France and the Yemen, would become a unilateral declaration by France and would not require the signature of a Yemeni representative. Such a unilateral declaration would, however, seem to be equally satisfactory ao farss the interests of France are concerned, 4. If, on the other hand, it were though necessary to put forward to the King of the Yemen the draft agreement as it stands, Lord Halifax considers it doubtful whether it would prove possible to persuade the King of the Yemen to accept it. The King might well fear lest, by signing such a document, he might subsequently be held to have recognised the existence of a claim which he has never recognised in the past. He might also take the line that he is unwilling to assume, at least by implication, a limitation rn his own freedom of action which might be though to be incompatible with his sovereignty . The Middle Eastern Agreement has already led to representations by King Abdul Aziz (ibn 3aud) who considered that certain of its clauses infringed the independence of Saudi Arabia; his attitude being/being that, while he has every intention of maintaining the independence and integrity of his own dominions, he sees no reason why he should be forbidden to do otherwise by s*me other State. King Abdul Aziz has thought it necessary to address identic notes to the British and Italian Government asking for assurances (which have been given) that the agreement imposes no obligation on Saudi Arabia, and that the relation between the two Governments and Saudi Arabia are governed solely by international law and practice and the treaties in force between them. The King nf the Yemen is certainly aware of the views of King Abdul Aziz on this question, and it may well be that he will view the agreement proposed by the French Government with equal suspicion. • 5.

At the same time it would he most difficult for His Majesty’s Government to bring pressure to bear on the King to conclude it. Apart from the question whether their intervention would do harm or good, it would be embarrassing to His Majesty's Government to assume the role of pressing the King to accept an agreement in v/hich he is asked to recognise formally the existence of a French claim which past British Governments have always believed to have no merits, and to assume, at least by implication, a limitation on his own freedom of action which he might think incompatible with his sovereignty.

LACY t- aGALLAY.*■■M copy - -^E S404/110/91). (58/5/39) 940 ? British Emhassy, Parisc 30th March, 1939. My dear Baxter, When I handed to M. Lagarde to-day the Aide- Memoire based on Foreign Office despatch No. 705 of 34th March about alleged Italian activities in the Red Sea, he took the opportunity to refer to the question of the French claims to Sheikh Said. He said he would like to make an unofficial enquiry with regard to His Majesty’s Government’s opinion on French rights over this peninsula. He seemed to think that we had a definite opinion. The reason, he said, why they would be grateful for an unofficial and oral indication of our views was that the son of the King of the Yemen, when passing through Paris on his way to the Palestine Conference, had asked what was the French attitude. He would no doubt be returning shortly and the Ministry would like to be able tc give him an answer as they had promised to do on his earlier visit. M. Lagarde said that French rights rested on an agreement with the local Chiefs of October 1868, and the treaty of 7th July, 1870, with the Ottoman Government. The question of the French rights was a complicated and juridical one, but the matter for the moment presented itself in a practical way. At/ C.W. Baxter, Esq., M.C.At the time of the negotiation of the Anglo- Italian Agreement signed in April 1938, the French Government had, he said, enquired what was the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards Italian claims, hut had received no answer. Recently the French Ambassador in London had spoken on the subject of Sheikh Said and the Red Sea in a general way to vansittart, but he had not received an expression of our views on the French claims to Sheikh Said. In view of the general close association between our two Governments and in view of the great British interests in the Red Sea, the Ministry would wish that the attitude of the two Governments should, if possible, be similar on this point, and they wished, if possible, to avoid taking any action contrary to our views. What they were thinking of saying to the Emir was that they reserved their righis in Sheikh Said but did not intend to put them into effect unless a third party (obviously Italy) landed or attempted to land upon the peninsula, or upon the Yemeni coasto As this subject is a matter of discussion between the Foreign Office and other departments, I thought it best not to give to M. Lagarde on this occasion, at any rate, the view expressed in the first sentence of paragraph 5 of Foreign Office letter (E 1486/728/91) of the 7th March to the Admiralty and Colonial Office. Would you let me know, as soon as you conveniently can, what, if anything, I’ should say to Lagarde, or what you decide to say to the French Embassy in case/case you give any answer and choose that channel. Lagarde said that he would he glad to supply us with copies of the treaties of 1st October, 1868 and 7th July, 1870, if we should like to have them. Yours ever (For R. I. Campbell) (Sgd.) W.H.B. Mack.r Hr&gt; (E 2404/110/91) FOREIGN OPPICE, S.W. 1. 17th April, 1939. n n O O F- My dear Ronnie, I am sorry that owing, to Easter and* other preoccupations it has not been possible for us to answer sooner your letter (58/5/39) of the 30th March to Charles Baxter (who is away) about the French claim to bheikh Laid* 2. We should be interested to see the agreements of October 1868 and the 7th July, 1870, the exact texts of which do not seem to be available here. Without seeing these agreements we would hesitate to express any opinions to their value or effect when they were concluded. But we can say right away that the French claim was never recognized by His Majesty’s Government in the past, and that it seems to have been consistently regarded here for the last seventy years as having no foundation. R.I. Campbell, Esq.. , C.Br, C.M.G. Paris.I I'll IIIfoundation* Since M. Lagarde has asked for an unofficial expression of our opinion, we have no objection to your telling him so’ I think the same opinion has been expressed to the French Government on more than one occasion in the years before the war* 3. But we agree with M. Lagarde that what matters is the practical aspect. From this point of view we could only regard any attempt to assert the French claim as unwise in the extreme. Sheikh.Laid is not only incontestably in Yemeni territory, but it has been recognised as such by both Great Britain and Italy. The French Government have never, as we know, liked the Middle Eastern Agreement of the 16th April, 1938, but in our vi^w that agreement is valuable not only for us but for France as well. It will not stop trouble extending to the Red Lea if there is trouble everywhere. But we hope it may stop trouble starting there. Lowe do not want to do or see anything done which might disturb it. 4. Moreover, our enquiries go to show that there is no truth in the recent stories of Italian guns being placed at bheikh Said. What we have heard is that the Yemenis are going to place some guns there and that their reason for doing so is probably fear of a French coup in view of all the talk in the French press etc. 5. In these circumstances we should prefer that the French Government said nothing at all to the Yemenis about Sheikh Said, especially as they signed a treaty with the Yemen in 1936 in which they made no reservations about their claim. This is however, an unofficial expression of opinion, such as M. Lagarde has asked for, and if the French Government are really set upon making such a communication we suggestsuggest that they should raise it more officially. 6. The fact that we hold the views expressed above does not mean that we do not realise the possibility of an Italian occupation of Gheikh baid occurring as a prelude to general hostilities. That, however, is a different matter altogether. Such an occupation would be or inevitably become a military and not a political occupation, and the question of a French or British occupation to frustrate an Italian occupation would likewise be a military and not a political question, which should not, in our emphatic opinion, be resolved by either France or Great Britain except after the fullest consultation between the two Governments. Moreover, even if such an occupation were thought to be a wise precaution from the military point of view, its value^!L 'T &amp;aa { value would have to be balanced against the fact that it would very likely bring the Yemen into the war on the side of our enemies, I am sending copies of this correspondence to Rome Embassy and Jedda, (Sd.)

(E 7608/4822/91) 123/3 r\ » siL - British Consulate, Jibuti. 26th November, 1938* l_ f9c’ '• \ \ Dear Department, It will be of interest to you to know that French interest in Yemeni polities is becoming increasingly evident in this part of the world. Since the visits of Abdu f r Rahman Banabila and Monsieur Paul Zerbib to Sana’a (see our letters to you Nos. 108/14 and 108A5 of 26th August) during the past months I am assured th t the authorities of the French Somali Coast are doing all in their power to Improve their relations with the Imerr and to maintain a constant and reliable flow of information regarding the rise and fall of Yemeni internal politics. The reason for this sudden Interest is not far to se*-k. The heads of the Bureau dee Affaires Folitiques in general and Monsieur ZcrMb in particular are exceedingly disturbed at the reports which reach them of the degree of succes being obtained by Italian propaganda in the Yemen. My impression is that, while they would gladly leave the work of neutrali stion of this to us they fear that v;hat they regard as the British genius for procrastination will sooner or later land us and them in the position of Swellondng the unpalatable draught of another ^alt accomp li when nn Tt lian 1 rotectorate (at the very least) is established in the Yemen. I doubt whether thib sud en interest is inspired by an. other motive. It is certain that the French take a grave view of the situation. Zerbib himself/ The Eastern Department, Foreign Office, S. lv. 1*■■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■■■■■I himself shoved me the other day an extract from a confidential report in which he had stated guite baldly that the situation was such as to call for an immediate exchange of views on the part of the French and British Governments on the subject of the policy to be adopted by them in connexion with Yemen affairs. ierbib*s visit to the Yemen seems generally to have been regarded as a failure in respect of the establishment of closer relations *ith the Imam and the central Government, but he returned with three strong impressions, namely 1) of the poverty of the country and its resemblance, administratively and politically speaking, to the old rj 'thioria, 9) of the threefold comprehensiveness of Italian propaganda through literary, commercial and financial channels ^nd the fact that all the provincial Governors and many of the major officials were cuite openly in the pay of the Italians, and 3) of the virtual certainty of some kind of upheaval of a revolutionary nature after the death of the Imam (see our letter 108/15.) The latest action on the part of the French has been the establishment here as a dentist of one Msnduh, son of Hassan Tahsir Pasha el Faqir, who is one of the heads of the Yemeni army, and son-in-law of Ragheb Bey the Foreign Minister. This man will no doubt serve as a channel of communication and information and will almost certainly make it possible for his father-in-law, who is already drawing money from the Italians, to make something out of the French as well. The official representative \ of the Imam in the French Somali Coast, Sheikh Ahmad Saleh Addnheri, is reticent about the arrival of his compatriot, who, it appears, is Syrian in outlook and educetion.

I have thought these developments worthy of being recorded in a special report but I doubt whether any real political significance attaches either to M.Maigret's visit to San 1 a or to the changes affecting the French representation in Jedda. As you are aware M.Maigret plays no important ro le here. He is a fairly well-informed observer of events but he has not visited France for some years and continues to give the impression of having little pull with the French Government. He has a much greater connexion with Syria and the French authorities there. He has vague leanings towards Islam and is, I think, on the best of terms with King Abdul Aziz and the Saudi Government but even with them he does not appear to carry much weight. I believe that the creation of a legation and M.Maigret*3 promotion are more than anything else the realisation of his own moderate ambitions and would have taken place sooner but for financial considerations in Paris.In any further com mun ication on tlus subjecL please quote No, , and address —not to ttny person by «aw«,'but to “The Under-Secretary of State,” tofCign Office, London, S.W.

JEDDA w Sir Monsieur Roger Maigret, the French Charge d’ATfaires here, called on me on August 1 and said that he was about to go to Sana* for a short time on a mission from his Government. He expected a French warship to call for him hrer on August 6 and hoped to be back by the end of the month. 2. Monsieur Maigret was at pains to assure me that you were fully informed regarding his mission and that its nature was M purement protocolaire.' A French mission of some sort had visited Sana’ last December, had been well received and had left with a letter from the Imam to the President of the Republic. The sole object of Monsieur Maigret’s mission was to deliver a suitable reply. In view of these statements I have not thought it necessary to report by telegraph. 3. Secret . From information in my archives, the nature of which compels me to mark this innocent para graph M Secret, M I find that two Frenchmen, Capitaine R. Montagne and Monsieur R.

It is not in the least likely that a cold personally willingly assist Italyfor or acquiesce in oheir invasion. He hates and fears them. His amy would be powerless to resist them and Bhafei population would if handled aright actively aid them. It is therefore difficult to see“that Ibn Saud’a exhortations to Imam could achieve any useful purpose. Crown Prince is still somewhat an enigma and opinions have been expressed that although he fears the Italians he might actively aid them if he thought that they were likely to succeed.

THE French Ambassador, in his memorandum of the 19th May, was so f ood as to communicate to Lord Halifax the views of the French Ministry for dreign Affairs with regard to the question of Sheikh Said, and to enclose the text of a draft agreement with the King of the Yemen. M. Corbin requested that he might be informed of the views of Lord Halifax on the document and also enquired whether the Foreign Office would be disposed to use their influence with the King of the Yemen with a view to persuading His Majesty to sign an agree ment on the lines proposed. 2. Lord Halifax has now considered the French Ambassador’s memorandum and the draft agreement enclosed therein. He will be grateful if his Excellency will inform the French Government that His Majesty’s Government welcome their readiness to declare that they have no intention of raising the question of Sheikh Said so long as the King of the Yemen continues to occupy Sheikh Said effectively, and refrains from ceding, leasing or mortgaging any part of his territory or entrusting its defence, either expressly or tacitly, to a third Power. The proposed declaration is in entire accordance with the declaration which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have themselves made in the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April, 1938, regarding certain areas in the Middle East. 3. The French Ministry for Foreign Affairs may, however, wish to consider the desirability of omitting the last paragraph of the draft agreement. This clause provides that His Majesty the King of the Yemen is to take note of the French Government’s declaration, and is to express his acquiescence in its substance. It is not understood what practical advantage there would he in endeavouring to persuade the King of the Yemen to sign a statement on these lines. Its omission would, it is true, alter the form of the document, which, instead of being a bilateral agreement between France and the Yemen, would become a unilateral declaration by France and would not require the signature of a Temeni representative. Such a unilateral declaration would, however, seem to be equally satisfactory so far as the interests of France are concerned. 4. If, on the other hand, it were thought necessary to put forward to the King of the Yemen the draft agreement as it stands, Lord Halifax considers it doubtful whether it would prove possible to persuade the King of the Yemen to accept it. The King might well fear lest, by signing such a document, he might subsequently be held to have recognised the existence of a claim which he has never recognised in the past. He might also take the line that he is unwilling to assume, at least by implication, a limitation on his own freedom of action which might be thought to be incompatible with his sovereignty. The Middle Eastern Agree ment has already led to representations by King Abdul Aziz (Ibn Saud^who considered that certain of its clauses infringed the independence of Saudi Arabia; his attitude being that, while he has every intention of maintaining the independence and integrity of his own dominions, he sees no reason why he should be forbidden to do otherwise by some other State. King Abdul Aziz has thought it necessary to address identical notes to the British and Italian Governments asking for assurances (which have been given) that the agreement imposes no obligation on Saudi Arabia, and that the relations between the two Governments and Saudi Arabia are governed solely by international law and practice and the treaties in force between them. The King of the Yemen is certainly aware of the views of King Abdul Aziz on this question, and it may well be that he will view the agreement proposed by the French Government with equal suspicion. 5. If the French Government, after having considered the objections explained in the previous paragraph of this memorandum, should feel able to omit the last paragraph of their draft agreement, and to make a unilateral declaration on the lines of the remaining paragraphs of the draft, Lord Halifax would certainly be prepared to support the French Government’s action. He would propose in that event to send, through the Governor of Aden, a message to the King of the Yemen stating that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have been provided with an advance copy of the French Government’s3 declaration, and that they have no doubt that the King of the Yemen will be highly gratified to hear of the French Government’s action, which is clearly sutficient to remove any apprehension on his part with regard to French intentions towards the Yemen.
