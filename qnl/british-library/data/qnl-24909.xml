GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Dr. Clemow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 66.) Constantinople, June 8, 1912. IN the course of last year’s pilgrim season, complaints were more than once made by the authorities of the Hedjaz Railway against the director of the Tebuk lazaret, Dr. Eerid Ibrahim. On the 26th November last a teskereh from the Grand Vizier on this subject was communicated to the Board of Health, and it was then decided to send the vice-president of the hoard, Dr. Djenab Shehabeddm, on a mission to Tehuk to enquire into the complaints referred to. At the following meeting, it was farther decided that the Erench delegate, Dr. Delamare, should accompany the vice- president on his mission. In spite of the very just remarks of the then acting British delegate, Dr. McClean, to the effect that this mission might well replace the one decided on early in 1910 (which formed the subject of several despatches from rne at that period), his proposal in that sense was not adopted. ^ It may be added, m passing, that, though nearly two and a-half years have elapsed since that mission was dec idec on and its members named it has never started, nor is there any sign of its intending The enquiry made by Drs. Djenab Shehaheddin and Delamare into the complaints against the directors of the Tebuk lazaret will probably lead to certain administrative reforms in that institution which need not he more fully referred to here. 1 ieir mission has, however, led to the publication of an interesting report on the question o the sanitary defence of the Hedjaz line by Dr. Delamare, and I have now the honour to transmit several copies of that report. +„i, 0 „ In this report I)r. Delamare reviews at some length the measures already taken to ensure the sanitary defence of the line, and discusses many of' tie con roveisia points which have been raised in this connection during t e pas ew years, observations made on the spot lead him to approve thorough y le c oice o , a site for the principal lazaret on the line—choice made by the mission which travdied down the line in 1908. He also confirms in practically every detail the arguments that I have been compelled to put forward on several occasions (m the Board ol tlealtii, m the International Sanitary Conference at Paris, and in the monograph on the subject that I published in 1910) in defence of that choice. There is in fact, no ottier spot on the 1 line that presents so many advantages and so few disadvantages as T.buk to the construction of a large pilgrims’ lazaret. The question of the desirability of sue a lazaret and of the utility of land quarantines of any kind is another matter and Dr. Delamare quotes, with approval, the remarks that I have made elsewhere on t subject. ^ manner; t j le aues ti on 0 f the actual equipment of the Tebuk lazaret and of the need of improvements there is a matter for separate consideration, and the board will no doubt carry out many of the recommendations contained m the enctesed rep . In his closing pamgniph.®; Dr. Delamare raises the question of the abandor [2528 r—2]/^' \ {.* 12JUL1Q12r of a land quarantine, and the substitution for it of a system, to which he gives the title of “ prophylaxie hygi&amp;nique,” along the line. This would consist of improve ments in the sanitary conditions under which the pilgrims travel, a diminution in the overcrowding that now obtains in the pilgrim trains, the distribution of good water to the pilgrims on the journey, the construction of latrines at the stations, and so forth and, in time of epidemic, in submitting the pilgrims to a medical inspection at certain intermediate stations, where small hospitals would be put up for the isolation of cases ^ o plague or cholera found at those inspections. This is practically in everv respect identical with the scheme I had outlined in the monograph above referred to. The sole difference is that I proposed to combine the above measures with the creation of a large lazaret at Tebuk, where the main measures of disinfection and even fin view of the present state of public opinion) some period of quarantine would be applied And It is noteworthy that Dr. Delamare appears to be of very much the same opinion, even on this point, and to recommend the retention and improvement of the Tebuk lazaret there is, however one additional suggestion made by Dr. Delamare which howeier desirable in theory, would meet with many difficulties and objections in where 0 the H u re “ mme f. ds l P- the constru ction at Damascus of several houses certeL neri P od Srl S,ich af s er l6aVlng ‘ 16 ‘“i 1 ’ WOuld b ° uncler observation fora ceitam period.

I have the honour now to transmit copies thereof. It covers considerably wider ground than Dr. Delamare’s report, but, as already stated, the latter confirms almost in every detail the conclusions and proposals contained in the earlier work. E. G. C.Moulvi Inshi-tjllah, editor of the Watan, Lahore, has re mitted to the Hedjaz Railway Fund at Constantinople the thirty- fourth instalment, amounting to 1,120 re., collected from his readers during the past two and a half months. The chief con tributor of the present instalment is a Moslem lady of Buland- shahr district. Including this remittance, the editor of the 'Watan has altogether remitted about 98,000 rs., or about 7,0001. 'The present remittance is four times greater than the preceding •one, but still it bears no comparison with the amounts of the xemittances sent in 1908 when the line was being completed down to Medina. Notwithstanding many official or semi-official announcements on the part of the Turkish Government there are yet no visible signs of an early resumption of work on the most important portion of the line between Medina and Mecca. General disappointment caused by the attitude of the Turkish Government has been recently increased by the persistent com plaints regarding the maladministration of the already completed part of the line to such an extent that an Egyptian newspaper Al Ahrom (The Pyramids) has very recently given vent to it in a very outspoken manner. It says that the gross receipts of the last year, some 30 lacs of rupees, must have amounted to one crore of rupees if the administration had been intelligent and good. 'The paper pays an unintentional or indirect tribute to the good work done by the Pax Britannica in Egypt by remarking that Turks, owing to inexperience, are totally unfit for managing such enterprises, and unless the Ottoman Government borrows the services of experienced Egyptian officials matters will continue to go from bad to worse. The Watan has announced its intention of stopping the fund on the completion of the round sum of 1,00,000 rs. if the work is not resumed on the uncompleted portion of the line.jy ^yp ^This Docmnent is the Property of ritannic Majesty s GovenoaeoL] n fli EASTERN SANITARY REFORMS. / E CONFIDENTIAL. 11 [December 13.] iho [ 45135 ] No. 1.

MARLING. Inclosnre in No. 1. Dr. Clemow to Mr. Marling. (No. 101.) Constantinople, November 30, 1909. IN returning herewith the Foreign Office letter No. 74, Commercial, transmitting a report from Dr. Morrison on the question of the use of the Hedjaz Railway by Egyptian pilgrims, I have the honour to offer, as requested, the following remarks. Dr. Morrison’s memorandum, which is dated the 24th July, is in con mua ion o his earlier despatch, dated the 7th May, and the two have to be considered together. I quite concur as to the desirability of inducing the Egyptian pilgrims to go to t e Hedi'az by the railway (if they must use the line at all) and return by sea, rather than travel in the reverse direction. This is, of course, a matter which concerns solely the Egyptian Government. If that Government can find means, m practice, of obliging their pilgrims to choose a particular route, it will be so much the better for all concerned, for a sea route will always be much more easily defended than a land route, and, moreover, the sea route in question is already provided with an excellent lazaret (the growth of many years), while the land route has at present only a temporary lazaret (the growth of a single season). I would, however, venture to repeat what I have stated m former despatches . that the relation of Egypt to the Hedjaz Railway is only a minor part of the great question of the sanitary defence of that line. Egypt will probably rarely furnish more than about one-teuth of the whole number of pilgrims using the line. The mam measures of sanitary defence on this railway must be proportioned to the whole number ot nilgrims travelling by it, irrespective of their nationality or destination. With regard to the question of the efficiency of the Tebuk lazaret (the point on which my opinion is especially asked), I have to offer the following observations This lazaret has been in existence for one season only. It is admittedly a provisional institution. The Turkish Government having shown no disposition to provide for the sanitary defence of the line (though it is a purely interior Turkish railway), the Board of Health here, in view of the sheer necessity of doing something to protect this new and dangerous route from the spread of disease, itself took measures, and advanced money (which it had collected solely for the external defence o t country, and mainly from navigation) for the construction of tbe lazamt m que^io . In the first year some twelve or more thousand Turkish liras (£ 1.12,0UU or mo ) have been advanced for this purpose. No one would dream f ] com P™^ S a institution with the highlv organised and exceedingly efficient lazaret of Lamar a ^ with that of El Tor. I have very little doubt, however, that it is quite as efficient a^ the Tor lazaret was in the first year of its existence, after its transfer fiom j about the vear 1878. If the Turkish Government can be induced to perform its duty and contribute as liberally as the Egyptian Government does to th ® c0 ™ t ^ 0 ‘ 1 ^ l4 * sanitary institutions, there is no reason why, m time, the lazaret on the Hedjaz y should not become as admirable an establishment as that of Gamaran or Li lor. [2570 n—1]In the meantime, of necessity, the efficiency of the Tebnk lazaret is only relative. The degree of protection that it offers against the spread of disease is, in view of all the circumstances, very considerable, hut, of course, it is not complete. I therefore, as stated above, see no reason why Egypt should not take such measures as she depc.8 necessary and practicable to make her pilgrims return by sea rather than by land. The main problem—the sanitary defence of the railway in the future still, . s already pointed out, requires solution. When in Budapest two months ago, on the occasion of the International Medical Congress, this question formed the subject of prolonged conversation between Dr. Buffer, the president of the Alexandria Board, Dr. Kaller, my Austrian colleague here, and myself. A. suggestion was made that a conference on the subject between representatives of the Constantinople and Alexandria Boards might prove useful. I think there is much to be said for such a suggestion, though the attitude of Turkey towards such a proposal is uncertain. I have, &amp;c. F. G.

I AM directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 11th ultimo, transmitting, for their observations, copy of a despatch Irom^ ills Maiesty’s consul-general at Alexandria enclosing copy of Dr. Morrison s report ot the May meeting of the Egyptian Quarantine Board, at which it was decided to appoint a commissior to study the whole question of the return of pilgrims by the Hedjaz Bailway in relation to the sanitary defence of Egypt. ^ I am to observe that it is not clear that Dr. Morrison m his report does not somewhat over-estimate the drawbacks attendant on the Hedjaz Bailway route, while under-estimating those attendant on the Tor route. The railway journey it is to he presumed, will secure a saving in time, and it is doubtful if the discomforts of t ic train will be greater than those of the ordinary pilgrim ship. Moreover unless the tribes along the line of the railway route give trouble, the railway route is likely to be safer than the road from Medina to Yambo, on which in recent pilgrimages there has been a serious amount of robbery with violence. t j + 4 .v, As indicated in Dr. Morrison’s report, there is good reason to conclude that the creation of a new lazaret on the Mediterranean shore of Egypt wouid foliow it Egyptian pilgrims were allowed to return by the Hedjaz Bailway. It iurkish administration of the lazaret at Tebouk, on the line of the railway, could be trusted to be efficient, there would probably be no need to quarantine Egyptian pilgrims on their arrival in Egypt by way of the railway and Syria; but Dr Morrison doubts the efficiency of this' lazaret, and it seems improbable that the Egyptian Quarantine Board would be content to accept quarantine at Tebouk as a sufficient safeguard against the importation of plague or cholera into Egypt. It appears almost certain, therefore, that acceptance of the principle that Egyptian pilgrims may return from the Hediaz by the railway and Syria would involve the creation of a new lazaret on the Mediterranean shore of Egypt, probably at consideraole cost. It would also entail diminution- -perhaps great diminution—of the use of the lazaret at lor, a regrettable consequence, having regard to the large sums of money that have been expended on its construction. , , , ^ ‘ ^ In view of these considerations, it appears to the Board to be desirable, even though there may be certain advantages to the pilgrims in the return by the Hedjaz Railway, that Egyptian pilgrims should return only by way of lor.

No. 1. ic .. &lt; M Xq Consul-General Gould to Sir Edward Grey*—(Received May 28.) V© (No. 4. Commercial.) Sir, Alexandria, May 15, 1909. I HAVE the honour to transmit Dr. Morrison’s report of the May meeting of the Quarantine Board. In this report Dr. Morrison deals with two questions— 1. The expense of the maintenance of the quarantine station at Suakin. 2. The question of the return of pilgrims by the Hedjaz Railway. As to the first subject, Dr. Morrison shows that the expenses of maintaining the Suakin station is very large, and that the sum of 4,000/. a-year is now required to meet the demand. At present the Egyptian Government contributes only 500/. towards this amount. Dr. Morrison expresses a hope that this contribution will be increased without delay. I am unable to say whether the Egyptian Government is ready to accept the responsibility of the whole expense of this station, or whether it may he found possible to any extent to make the pilgrims themselves pay for the maintenance of this very necessary establishment. The Soudan and Egypt are immediately and vitally interested in this quarantine protection, but it will also he remembered that the whole of Central Africa, and therefore practically the entire continent, is also interested in the matter. In any case, it appears desirable that the question should be put on a permanent footing as soon as possible in order to meet the reasonable enquiries of the foreign delegates of the hoard. As to the second subject, viz., the return of pilgrims by the Hedjaz Railway, Dr. Morrison argues ably and at length against the establishment of a quarantine station for the pilgrims on the Mediterranean coast, and in favour of continuing to compel the returning pilgrims to pass through Tor as hitherto. Dr. Morrison’s arguments will no doubt receive the careful consideration they deserve. Should his view prevail and it be desired to continue to insist upon returning pilgrims passing through Tor, the authorities must he prepared to meet and deal with the cases of pilgrims who, in spite of all warnings and notices, return by the Hedjaz Enilway and arrive on the Syrian coast destitute. This year, as reported in my despatch No. 3 of the 18th April, 1909, a hatch of such pilgrims had to he dealt with. The case was treated as exceptional, and the pilgrims were admitted to Egypt direct. Had they been infected with cholera or plague they could not have been so easily dealt with. Every time that pilgrims who have disregarded the rules are thus absolved from the consequences of their contumacy a precedent is set which will every year induce more and more pilgrims to take the route they prefer and chance the consequences. It appears, therefore, that either the existing rules must be enforced regardless of the sufferings of those who disobey them, or that Egypt will be ultimately driven into the expense of a new and elaborate station like Tor on the Mediterranean coast. It is beyond my province to attempt to appreciate the arguments which will have to be considered in deciding this question. It is, however, an urgent one, and brings into prominence the heavy burden thrown on Egypt as the sanitary warden of the main gate to Europe from the East. I have, &amp;c. E. B. GOULD. * Copy sent to Local Government Board for their observations, June 11, 1909. [2292 ee—1] B2 Inclosure in No. 1. Dr. Morrison to Consul-General Gould. Sir, Alexandria, May 7, 1909. I HAVE the honour to present the following report of the monthly meeting of the Quarantine Board on the 4th May :— Closure of the 1908-9 pilgrimage, and the suppression of all measures except for Suakin. The president proposed to declare this year’s pilgrimage closed at Tor, but to maintain the station at Suakin, for the Soudanese and other pilgrims that pass by Suakin continue all the year round. Basing his remarks on this text, the French delegate desired once more to draw the president’s attention to the ever increasing cost of the Suakin station. The president replied that he had been in communication with the Egyptian Government on the matter, hut that the negotiations had not yet terminated. This matter, of the Suakin station, begins to become serious, so I desire to state the case as briefly as I can. The Finance Committee, in this year’s financial statement, made some very fair observations on the expense of the Suakin station. In my report on this year’s budget (dated the 2nd March) I made the following remarks:— u The Suakin sanitary station has to he kept open all the year round; for the Soudan pilgrim does not, in many cases content himself with performing the required rites in the holy places, but practically makes a year of it sojourning in the Hedjaz. Hence the expense of keeping open a sanitary station is excessive. The grant of £ E. 500 by the Government by no means covers the outlay, a matter that will have to be seriously considered, especially if the Quarantine Board’s receipts go on diminishing without a corresponding diminution of expenditures.” I desire now to go more into detail on this matter. Before the year 1902 Soudanese pilgrims were bound, in conformity with the regulations, to return by way of Tor to undergo the specified disinfection and observa tion there. The Egyptian Government, desiring to spare the Soudanese pilgrims the fatigues of the journey to Tor, asked the Quarantine Board to establish a station at Suakin for Soudanese pilgrims. After pourparlers that lasted two years the board, at its meeting of the 3rd June, 1902, decided to create a Suakin station on the following conditions (I quote from the proces-verbal oi the meeting of that date):— “1. Tons les frais d’installation et d’entretien de cette station seront apportes par le Gouvernement egyptien. “ 2. Le service sanitaire maritime et quarantenaire de Suakin dependra exclusive- ment, et dans les^memes conditions que par le passe, du Conseil sanitaire maritime et quarantenaire d’Egypte.” The establishment of the Suakin station was unanimously accepted, on those conditions, by the Powers. The Egyptian Government handed over to the board a sum of money for the installation of the station, and asked the quarantine administration to state what sum they required for its annual upkeep. The administration, basing its calcula tions on the data of that time, asked for £ E. 500 a-year, which sum was granted. Now the number of pilgrims that passed through Suakin the first year was 371 only, and the station was kept open four months. But the numbers have gone on increasing by leaps and bounds, the pilgrims keep returning the whole year round, and the expenses naturally increase pari passu. Thus in 1907 there were 4,587 pilgrims, twelve times the numbers of 1902, and this year, from the 1st January to the end of April, 4,300 pilgrims have passed through Suakin. Also in 1908 the expense of maintaining the Suakin station amounted to £ E. 5,300.Let me analyse the latter figure a little— 1. The Egyptian Government give an annual grant of £ E. 500. 2. The receipts from pilgrims amounted to £ E. 480. . „ ^ . _ 3. Before the establishment of the Suakin station, the administration ol kuakm $t the hoard about £ E. 738. It is obviously only fair to deduct the total of these three items^ £ E. LJIS from the total cost of £ E. 5,300. This leaves a balance of £ E. 3,582, which -EgyP^ 11 Government ought to make good to the board. Subtract the £ E. . e £ E. 738, and we get a total of £ E. 4,082, or in round numbers £ E. 4,000. ilns latter, instead of £ E. 500, is the sum that in justice the Egyptian Government ought to allow the board. I hope I have made the matter quite clear. I be leve a ie Suakin route has developed not solely with the increased number of pure y one ancse pilgrims, but also form a flow of Mussulman pilgrims from the centre ot Africa, even from the Congo, who are delighted with the facilities for performing the pilgrimage that are afforded by the Suakin station. p ji i I trust that the Egyptian Government will see that the position ot the board towards Suakin has completely changed, and that it is only reasonable and equitable that a large increase in the grant to the board should be made without delay. Proposal, by the President, to elect a Commission to study, in principle, the whole question of the return of pilgrims by the Hedjaz railway. At the April meeting of the board, when special facilities were granted for the return of a small group of Egyptian pilgrims (that had used the Hedjaz railway in spite of instructions to the contrary) from Jaffa to Mediterranean ports of Egypt, a decision was unanimously added to the following effect “de profiter de cette occasion pour faire connaitre au Gouvernement de son Altesse le Khedive combien il est necessaire d’avoir sur la cote dgyptienne de la Mediterranee un lazaret etendu, analogue a celui de Tor.” . , , ,. In my report of the April meeting I said: ‘ There was a third resolution, opposed by no one, to draw the Government’s attention to the necessity of es a - lishing a lazaretto for pilgrims on the Mediterranean shore of Egypt. W itii t ns matter I dealt fully in my report of the board’s meeting of the 12th January of this year; to that report I beg to draw your attention. I see no reason to withdraw from the position I then took up. I would especially deprecate dealing with the matter hurriedly; I think Egypt has protected itself adequately at Tor, and I see no reason for the Egyptian Government to launch out into what may prove formidab e expenses in the construction of a Mediterranean lazaretto.” I must sav I was struck with the light and airy way m which, at the last meeting, the hoard accepted such a serious proposition. A good many delegates evidently have been reflecting on the matter, and at this meeting the Erench, Austrian, and Italian delegates, in rather a clumsy manner admitted that they allowed the resolution to pass without having duly realised what they were doing In fact they regretted that they had, by their silence, supported it, and were anxious to expiate their omission by tacking on to the proces-verbal of the last meeting some Well, the president’s proposal to nominate a commission to study the principle of a Mediterranean station was adopted, and an old “ Commission des Amelioration was accepted, a commission made up of the Erench, Austrian, and luikis i an STP ia ^ delegates, the Powers most interested in pilgrims going and coming by way of Egypt. The idea to confide the matter to this old commission was suggested by the Erench delegate. Mr. Graves and myself silently acquiesced (as nobody seemed disposed to contest it), for absence from the commission facilitates criticism of i^s tin mgs. At the risk of repetition of my views laid down in my report ot the 12th January, I desire to express, as briefly as I can, the whole situation, for I am convince a 1 is the most important matter that has ever been submitted to the board, certainly since I have been a member, now seventeen years. , . . I desire specially to lay this matter before His Majesty s Government, to ask them to study it carefully and to give the British delegate (Mr. Graves; and myself the necessary instructions to enable us to represent authoritatively and adequately t eir view on the subject. I have no satisfactory map to make my views clearer but I am preparing a map of the Hedjaz and of the new Hedjaz Railway, which greatly facilitates perspicuity and clearness in discussing the matter, and m un ers -an mg i . [2292 ee—1] B 34 I propose to deal with the matter under three heads (1) The pilgrimage as it was before the construction of the railway. (2.) The pilgrimage as it is now, with the railway constructed as far south (3.) The pilgrimage as it will be when the railway is finished, presumably in near future. I shall suppose that we are dealing with an Egyptian pilgrim first of all. 1. The pilgrimage before the Construction of the Railway .— The pilgrim goes by Suez and the Red Sea to Jeddah. Goes on camel from Jeddah to Mecca (one and a- half day’s journey). At Mecca and its vicinity he goes through the religious rites and ceremonies. Then he goes on camel north to Medina (distance 243 miles, twelve or fourteen days’ journey), honours the prophet’s tomb there, goes from Medina to Yambo (port on the Red Sea) 120 miles, six days’ camel journey. Erom Yambo he sails for Tor, and thence back to Suez. Or else he reversed this journey, goes by Yambo to Medina, south to Mecca and then to Jeddah and back to Tor. 2. The pilgrimage as it now is, with the new railway construction as far south as Medina—The pilgrim goes from Egypt to Syria by steamer, embarks at Jaffa or Beyrout and goes by the long railway route from Damascus to Medina, 815 miles. He venerates the prophet’s tomb at Medina and thence he has to go to Mecca for the rites, twelve or fourteen days on camel, from Mecca to Jeddah, one and a-third days’ and thence to Tor. Or else (and here troubles begin to arrive) he goes to Jeddah by sea, to Mecca by camel, from Mecca to Medina by camel (fourteen days), and at Medina he either goes six days’ further journey to Yambo, or else he perversely joins the railway at Medina, goes 815 miles to Damascus, there to a Syrian port, where he desires to return to Egypt. At Jebouk on the railway, midway between Medina and Damascus, he has to undergo quarantine detention, &amp;c. 3. The pilgrimage as it will be when the railway is finished. —At present I believe work is going on between Mecca and Jeddah (a short line), but ultimately the 243 miles’ distance between Medina and Mecca will be completed. Then what will be the position ? The pilgrim can go to the holy places using the railway entirely except at the beginning and end of his journey, when he must go by sea. Now I wish to insist that the pilgrim should return by Tor. It involves no hardship whatever. If he desires to see the Hedjaz Railway, be can go that way. He proceeds to a Syrian port, goes the whole length of the railway, a long and very expensive journey of course, 815 miles by railway ; nevertheless he desires to g® that way and he goes. He sees Medina, goes on to Mecca by railway (when it is com pleted), finishes his religious observances, and is then homeward bound. He gets to Jeddah by train in a few hours, from Jeddah to Tor by steamer three days, at Tor he stays for sanitary measures and then embarks for Suez, where he arrives in twelve hours. Now, what possible advantage can it be for the pilgrim to return by Syria ? Erom Mecca to Damascus he has to go by railway more than 1,000 miles. About half-way he has to stop at Jebouk (exactly as he has to do at Tor), and arrived at Damascus he has to find his way to the coast, and thence return by steamer to Egypt. The journey by railway is much more expensive, much more fatiguing than the Red Sea, and lastly, from the sanitary point of view, much more dangerous. I am told that Jebouk is a fine place, ideal from every point of view as a detention station. 1 have no confidence in Jebouk. The Turkish Administration has had a sanitary station called Camaran for many years in the Red Sea. Will anyone say that it can be compared for efficiency with Tor ? Will Jebouk ever become'like Tor r Let us say that an outbreak of cholera occurs in the Hedjaz. Will anyone have the hardihood to assert that Jebouk will be efficient ? Why, the whole Hedjaz Railway will get infected with cholera, and the pilgrims will assuredly bring it to Syria. Then, what shall we do with our Egyptian pilgrims ? Let them come to Alexandria or Port Said in a new lazaretto constructed there ? They would certainly in that case infect Egypt. Construct a new lazaretto near Alexandria ! It would be impossible to isolate it effectively. Jebouk would be illusory, Alexandria would be illusory. Why change Tor ? Does going there involve any hardship greater than going by the new railway to Jebouk ? At Tor we have the finest sanitary station in the world, cost about 200,000/.

My local knowledge, coupled with a prolonged study of the question in all its bearings, compels me to oppose such a scheme as dangerous and illusory from a sanitary point of view, and as mad and ridiculous financially. I do not for a moment believe that France, with its Mussulman population in West Africa, or Austria, with its Bosnian Mohammedans, would accept pilgrims straight from Syria to their own countries. In any case, such an innovation, a constant menace to the health of Europe, would have to be submitted to a new international conference, who I hope and believe would refuse to sanction an arrange ment that offers no guarantees as Tor does for efficient isolation and for the smothering of epidemic disease.

Sir E. Grey is disposed to concur in the views expressed by Sir G. Lowther in this despatch as to the best course to adopt in regard to this question Difficulties are likely to arise as a result of the attitude adopted by the Russian Delegate on the Board of Health, who opposes the principle of the imposition of a tax on the pilgrims in order to contribute towards the cost of construction of the new lazaret at Tebouk, and also in consequence of the disposition evinced by the Turkish members on the Board to regard the proposed tax of 25 piastres as a useful precedent for relieving the Ottoman Government of all financial responsibility in future in respect of the estab lishment and upkeep of lazarets. It appears to Sir E. Grey that the best course to pursue in the circumstances would be to make the assent of this country to any advance from the funds at the disposal of the Board of Health towards the erection of the Tebouk lazaret conditional on the previous reduction of the present sanitary dues by 20 per cent. Sir E. Grey therefore proposes, subject to the concurrence of the Local Govern ment Board, to inform Sir G. Lowther, by telegram, that he is authorized to instruct the British Delegate on the Board of Health in the sense of the last paragraph but two of this despatch. Dr. Clemow should also, Sir E. Grey considers, be instructed to support the claim of the Russian Delegate on the Board to recover the sums paid by Russian pilgrims under a tax which has been imposed without the consent of the Powers, and which is therefore contrary to the Capitulations.

I have, &amp;c. (Signed) GEBABD LOWTHER. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Dr. Clemow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 19.) Sir, Constantinople, February 1, 1909. WITH reference to my despatch No. 16 of the 22nd ultimo, I have the honour to furnish, as requested, the following information respecting the outlay already incurred for this year’s temporary lazaret at Tebuk and the probable number of pilgrims who will return by the Hedjaz Railway this pilgrim season. The sums already actually spent on the putting up of the temporary lazaret at Tebuk amount to 671,871*25 piastres or something over £ T. 6,000. This total does not include the cost of sending from Paris a special employe to mount the pavilions demontables furnished by a French firm, nor many other items, such as the pay of a large number of workmen sent from Damascus, and so forth. As pointed out in my despatch No. 68 of the 20th July last, I anticipated that the outlay for the temporary lazaret would be something between 5,000 and 10,000 liras, and it seems likely that in the end it will approach the higher of those two figures. On each occasion when fresh sums have been asked and voted by the Board I have been careful to repeat the reserve which has from the beginning been a condition of our accepting these advances from the Board’s funds, namely, that the whole question of the sanitary defence of the Hedjaz Railway should have formed the subject of an entente between the Porte and the Powers interested before any works had been undertaken, and that in the event of any deficit occurring in this new branch of the sanitary service it will be at the charge of the Ottoman Government. A statement of the details of the outlay already incurred is inclosed herewith. The number of pilgrims who may be expected to return this year by the Hedjaz Railway was estimated, in a telegram recently received from the sanitary officer at Medina, a/t about 14,000. (It may be noted, in passing, that the recent reports in the papers, to the effect that the Bedouins had cut the line between Medina and El Oula, appear to have been exaggerated; pilgrims are already arriving safely at Tebuk.) This number of 14,000 will very possibly prove to be exaggerated, particularly in view of the statements contained in Mr. Consul Devey’s despatch No. 2 of the 2nd ultimo. In any case (to judge by last year’s experience at Medaini Salih), less than half may be expected to pay their dues. If only 7,000 pay the 25 piastres surtax, the yield will be only 175,000 piastres, or rather over £ T. 1,600. The most liberal estimate can scarcely put it at a higher figure than from £ T. 2,000 to £ T. 2,500; whereas, as stated above, the outlay incurred for the Tebuk lazaret will be something between 6,000L and 10 , 000 /. The “quarantine” dues paid in the lazaret by 7,000 pilgrims, for five days quarantine, would amount to 315,000 piastres. This may possibly cover the cost of the medical mission to Tebuk, and the working expenses of the lazaret, that is to say, the expenses which, under existing Conventions and in the case of the maritime lazarets, would be at the charge of the Board’s funds.

I HAVE the honour to transmit a Report by Dr. Morrison of the proceedings at the January meeting of the Quarantine Board here. At this meeting the 1909 pilgrimage was declared infected in consequence of cases of plague in the Hedjaz, and the usual quarantine measures will be taken. A proposal for the modification of the rules made by the Turkish Delegate found no support. The Turkish Delegate, Dr. Mizzi, also proposed to change the decision come to last year, by which pilgrims returning to Egypt by the Hedjaz Railway and the Mediter ranean ports were to be sent through the Canal to Tor for disinfection and observation there, and to substitute for these arrangements provisions for observation at Alexandria or Port Said. Dr. Mizzi supported his proposal by representing that the Turkish Government had established at Tebouk on the Hedjaz Railway an entirely reliable and up-to-date quarantine station, and that therefore it was quite unnecessary from a sanitary point of view to oblige Egyptian pilgrims to go to Tor. Dr. Mizzi concluded by dwelling on the undesirability, from a Mussulman standpoint, of putting difficulties in the way of the use by pilgrims of the new railway, &gt; . . Dr. Morrison states at length the arguments against any immediate change m the existing arrangements. The Board, influenced by these considerations, decided to make no alteration. # .... The only other matter of interest dealt with was the water supply to ships in harbour. As reported in my despatch of the 18th December last, the fact that some of the tanks supplying ships were dangerously foul had been brought to the notice of the Board, and the question had arisen as to the powers of the Board to compel foreign subject tank-owners to comply with the Regulations of the Boaid. The Iiench Delegate at the last meeting had maintained that the Board had the necessary powers. The President before taking action, had preferred to take the opinion of the Egyptian Law Officers, and the question was adjourned until this meeting, when it was reopened. The President reported that ne was advised by the Egyptian Law Officers that the Board would require the sanction of the Mixed Tribunals before taking penal action ao-ainst recalcitrant tank-owners. The President, however, proposed to deal with the matter in another wav, viz., by indorsing the Bill of Health of a vessel, in such cases as required it, with the Remark that the water taken by the vessel was not approved by the quarantine authorities. The effect of this would obviously be to oblige tank-owners in their own interest to put their tanks in order. # i r i This practical solution of the matter met with the unanimous approval of the Board, and no doubt meets the case admirably. . „ ,, ^ The French Delegate still desired to affirm the principle of the power of the Board, and proposed a Resolution to this effect. This platonic Resolution was carried, nine Delegates voting for it and eight abstaining from voting at all. ° I have, &amp;c. (Signed) E. B. GOULD. Inclosure in No. 1. Dr. Morrison to Consul Gould. Alexandria, January 12, 1909. 1 HAVE the honour to present the following Keport oi pruceeumgs at tnc uauax monthly meeting of the Quarantine Board to-day : [2170 6 — 1 ] 1 M2 The 1909 Pilgrimage. The President proposed that, in view of the existence of cases of plague at Jeddah, and of at least one case at Mecca, this year’s pilgrimage should be declared infected with plague. \ The only critic of this proposal was the Ottoman Delegate, who, while not venturing to oppose the general proposition, begged for some facilities at Tor. He said that frequently vessels arriving at Tor from the Hedjaz had to wait two, three, or four days until their turn for disinfection came. He suggested that the period of detention—ten days— shall count from the date of the vessel’s arrival at Tor, and not from the day of the landing and disinfection ot the pilgrims. He mildly sneered at the idea that Eg\pt should be so alarmed at the existence of a few cases of plague in the Hedjaz while her own borders had been infected for several years. Replying first to the latter taunt, the President said that if cases of plague had existed in Egypt for several years the Suez Canal ports had remained practically free; it was desirable, therefore, to avoid the possible addition of a fresh focus of disease, especially in those ports. With reference to the suggestion to date the ten days’ observation period from the moment of the pilgrim ship’s arrival at Tor, he declared this to mean a return to the old theory of so many days’ detention instead of the acceptance of the modern theory of quarantine, namely, disinfection of men and things coming from infected countries and their detention under strict observation for a period commensurate with the incubation period of the disease. It was, declared Dr. Puffer, quite impossible even to examine a crowd of pilgrims on board ship; to land them, disinfect them, and individually examine them was the only effective means of control. Eo one supported the Turkish Delegate’s proposal, which is, of course, opposed to the “ Reglement.” Proposal by the Turkish Delegate to change the Decision of last Year ivith reference to the Return of Pilgrims by the new Hedjaz Railway. Last year, in view of the existence of cholera in the Hedjaz, the Board decided to prevent Egyptian pilgrims from using the new Hedjaz Railway and returning by the Mediterranean, because we had no satisfactory assurance that the quarantine station on the Hedjaz Railway was efficient, and because no means exist at Alexandria or at Port Said for dealing with large numbers of pilgrims. It was decided, therefore, that those pilgrims that, in the face of express prohibition,, chose the railway route and returned to Egypt by Syria and the Mediterranean should be sent through the Canal back to for for disinfection and observation there. A certain number braved the situation, and were ruthlessly repulsed to Tor. At to-day s meeting the Turkish Delegate, in a long and eloquent speech, proposed to change the decision of last year, and to allow Egyptian pilgrims to return bjF the Hedjaz Railway, by Syria, and by the Mediterranean, and to put them under observation for twenty-four or forty-eight hours at Alexandria or at Port Said. Before referring to the discussion at the meeting I desire to clear up the situation. First of all I understand that the Egyptian pilgrims were duly warned this year that they would have to return to Egypt by way of Tor. Secondly, the Hedjaz Railway terminates at Medina. Many pilgrims go to venerate the Piophet s tomb there, and subsequently go to Mecca and its vicinity for the sacrifice and feast. If they finish at Mecca they have only one and a-half days’ journey on camel to the port of Jeddah. If they go to Mecca first for the religious ceremonies and subsequently go to Medina, then they have 213 miles to go—a twelve days’ camel journey. lo return to Egypt, they may then take the long raihvay route north through Syria to Damascus (a distance of 815 miles approximately), then come by railway to Beiiout, and embaik at Beirout for Alexandria or Port Said. Or else, having done the twelve days camel journey to Medina, they do six days’ further journey (12U miles) to Yambo, on the Red Sea, whence they embark for Tor and Suez. One cannot therefore fairly say that the pilgrim is spared any material fatigue by adopting the new Hediaz- Syria Railway route. The pilgrim’s only legitimate object, therefore, in preferrino' the raiRay is an object that all Englishmen at least will respect, namely, a desire to°see a new country, dreary enough no doubt, but still presenting the undefinable charm of terra incognita. 1 return to the discussion. Dr. Mizzi (Turkish Delegate) said that a Commis-sion had chosen as an excellent sanitary station on the railway a place called Tebouk, about midway between Medina and Damascus. (Tebouk is about opposite the middle of the Gulf of Akaba, a little further north in latitude than Tor.) Tebouk is said to be easily supplied with water and provisions, and lends itself to isolation, while observation and disinfection can be carried out there efficiently. The temperature in summer does not rise beyond 104 degrees, and the nights are cool. The Commission that chose Tebouk went there in summer, and the whole installation is already declared to be reliable—a marvellous event, even if inspired by Young Turkey. I must say that the only part of Dr. Mizzi’s speech that impressed me was the peroration, in which he declared that this railway constructed by the Sultan was regarded by Moslems as the work of the Chief of Islam, entitled therefore to respect, and that full liberty should be granted to good Mussulmans to travel by it. The argument, sentimental though it is, appeals straight to English tolerance. At the same time there are innumerable difficulties. In the first place the Egyptian Board has just declared the pilgrimage infected, the Ottoman Government has declared it clean; how, therefore, can the treatment of Egyptian pilgrims at Tebouk meet our views ? Again, the Board is bound by the last Paris Convention, where Tor and Suakin are the only sanitary stations mentioned. It is impossible to deal thoroughly with crowds of Egyptian pilgrims at Alexandria or at Port Said. Egypt has spent large sums on bringing the station of Tor to a marvellous state of efficiency and comfort, and it would be ridiculous to suppose that Egypt can equip a similar sanitary station on the Mediterranean. Besides, it is proposed to carry the Hedjaz Railway as far south as Mecca, and link it with Jeddah. In that case the Egyptian pilgrims would naturally return by Jeddah and Tor, and a sanitary station on the Mediterranean would be useless. The Egyptian pilgrims, to use the new railway, could go by Syria to Mecca and return by the Red Sea. Whether the new situation created by the railway, unforeseen, or at least unpro vided for, at the last International Convention, will require an extension of &lt;£ Rbglement ” remains to be seen. It is said that the newly instituted Bureau Sanitaire at Paris has the matter under consideration. I doubt, however, their competency to legislate in the matter. On the whole I see no reason to change the status quo, especially in a hurry, until, with the lapse of a few years, one sees the permanent effect accomplished by the new Hedjaz Railway when it is declared finished. Water Supply to Ships in Egyptian Ports. This question was adjourned from the December meeting in order to give time for reflection. The Quarantine Administration drew up some reasonable and sensible rules for insuring the supply of good water to ships, the floating tanks being in many cases in a disgraceful state of neglect and unsuitability. Most of the tank proprietors acceded to the Regulations at once, though there were a few recalcitrant owners. Against the latter it might be necessary to use some degree of force. The Egyptian Goyernment, consulting the State lawyers in the matter, were advised that the Board must obtain sanction of the Mixed Courts. The French Delegate, standing on the powers and dignity of the Board, refused this, and returned to the charge to-day. But, first of all, the Spanish Consul, making one of his rare appearances at the Board, read a declaration that the Board was not competent to deal with the subject, and demanded a vote. His declaration met with no support. The French Delegate read a long speech, affirming the competency of the Board to deal with the matter, founding his argument on Articles 9, 12, and 26 of the “ Decret khedivial organique ”—Articles that I quoted in extenso in my December Report. He declared that, for his part, if the Administiation found that any French owner of a tank did not comply with their Regulations, and if we emptied his water into the sea, that he (the French Delegate) would approve of the step. The President, in a conciliatory speech, said that he believed that the Board would be able to get its way, without any recourse to violent measures, in the following- manner : If any tank-owner did not conform with the Regulations drawn up, and supplied water to a ship, then the bill of health of the vessel would be indorsed with the remark that the water supplied was not approved by the quarantine autho rities. Masters of vessels would take good care to avoid any such indorsement oftheir bills of health; and soon all floating tank-owners would be obliged to accept the Regulations and put their tnnks in older. . . ,, ,i ° The Delegates were all disposed to accept this solution. ^ At the same time the French Delegate returned to the charge. He said he was quite disposed to leave the details of asserting the Board’s authority to the Administration itself, only he desired ^ to have the Board’s opinion on the matter of principle He believed and he was fortified in his belief by instructions from his Government, that the Board had full power to deal with the question, and he desired a vote of the Board on the question of principle To the objection that the State lawyers were against him, and that it was well to be guided by the adage, Ne sutor ultra crepidam, he replied that he himself is also a -jurist, and that his opinion does not coincide with the State jurists. \V hat he seemed to desire was the expression of a sort of pious opinion that the Board has full rights in such a matter, and can, in virtue of Article 26, call on the police to aid in carrying out its decrees. Nobody opposed this platonic Resolution; nine Delegates supported it, while eight (including the British Delegate) abstained from votm^uriousi enoU g} 1) though I highly approve of Dr. Buffer’s vigilance in the matter of water supply to ships, there seems to be no distinct Regulation dealing with the matter in any European State. So that Egypt has established some pioneer Regulations which cannot fail to be useful and beneficial to ships’ passengers and crews. The Board unanimously adopted the President’s suggestion to indorse bills of health with the annotation that the water supply is not sanctioned by the port quarantine authorities if certain floating tank owners prove obdurate. Of course this measure will bring them to book. r xu 4 There was no other item of great interest in the proceedings of the Board. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR MORRISON. r[This Document is the Property of His f OA Maj esty’s Government.] EASTERN SANITARY REFORMS. CONFIDENTIAL. [February 8.] Section 1. [5075] No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received February 8.) (No. 21. Commercial.) Sir, Pera, January 28, 1909. WITH reference to previous correspondence, and especially to Mr. Barclay’s despatch No. 98 of the 25th July, 1908, on the subject of the proposed advance from the Board of Health’s reserves for the sanitary defence of the Hedjaz Railway, I have the honour to transmit herewith two despatches which I have recently received from the British Delegate on that Board. You will observe that several fresh points have arisen in connection with this question. Briefly stated, the matter stands thus. The advance of a large sum from the Board’s funds to cover the cost of the Tebuk lazaret would involve the selling out of investments in public funds, with consequent loss of interest on those funds. This would put in jeopardy the proposal to reduce the sanitary dues, to which His Majesty’s Government attach great importance. Consequently the suggestion was made that a compensating income should be found by imposing on every passenger using the railway a surtax of 25 piastres. Before making this proposal to the Mixed Commission, the Grand Vizier (as representing the Hedjaz Railway Commission) was sounded by a deputation from the Board as to whether the railway authorities would consent to collect this tax with the price of the tickets, in the event of the advance being made. A Memorandum (copy of which was inclosed in Dr. Clemow’s despatch No. 150 of the 28th November, which was transmitted with my No. 186 of the 1st December) dealing with this point, and with the whole question of the co-operation of the railway authorities with the sanitary officials, was presented by that deputation to the Grand Vizier; and Dr. Clemow informs me that, both in the discussions at the Board and in the interview with Kiamil Pasha, it was made perfectly clear, firstly, that the product of the tax would be destined to cover only the loss of interest on the sums advanced, and not on the capital outlay (which would, as in the case of the other lazarets, be at the charge of the Turkish Government), and, secondly, that the tax can only be applied after it had been created by the Mixed Commission, and agreed to by the Powers interested. In spite of this an Irade was issued, authorizing the immediate application of the tax. The' Vice-President of the Board has, Dr. Clemow states, erroneously represented to his Government that this was the intention of the Board from the beginning, and that the product of the tax in question was intended all along to cover the cost of building the lazaret, and not merely the loss of interest, although the contrary had been repeatedly made clear, as already stated. The Irade in question speaks of the tax as intended ‘‘pour faire face aux depenses de construction du lazaret,” and the Vice-President has further contended, with great violence of language, that his Government would never consent to a tax intended merely to cover the loss of interest on the Board’s investments. In the meantime the Russian Delegate, and to a less extent the Austrian, had vehemently opposed the levying of the tax before the necessary entente had been arrived at; and as the Board of Health is not competent to impose any new tax by mere majority, it was agreed at the meeting of the 7th January to postpone the applica tion of the tax in practice until the whole matter had been dealt with by the Mixed Commission. This decision was a perfectly correct and regular one, and it was thought that the matter had ended there for the time being. But at the meeting of the 12th January, when Dr. Clemow was absent owing to indisposition, the Vice- President succeeded in obtaining a decision by majority to apply the tax at once, in spite of the Russian Delegate’s very strong protests. As it w r as of primary import ance to safeguard the principle that the Board can under no circumstances create a tax by mere majority, I instructed the British Delegate to support his Russian colleague, who reopened the question at the meeting of the 21st January. After a long and stormy discussion a decision was come to, the exact text of which appears in [2170 /i—1] B i ?Dr. Clemow’s despatch No. 16. In this decision it is clearly laid down once for all that the Board is not competent to create new taxation by mere majority, and to that extent it is satisfactory. But it maintains the decision to apply the tax this year; not, however, as a “tax,” but as a “contribution” to cover the expenses already^- incurred for the temporary lazaret at Tebuk. Dr. Clemow tells me that, for reasons which are set forth in his despatch, and which appear to me cogent, he was careful to secure that the decision was applicable for one year only, and to make it clear that the product of the “contribution ” thus collected is to cover only the outlay already incurred for the temporary lazaret. Thus the question of the large advance for the permanent lazaret, and of a more or less permanent tax to cover the loss of interest on the sum advanced, is untouched by the decision, and must be settled elsewhere. To this extent the decision is also satisfactory; hut, as Dr. Clemow points out, it opens up a certain danger that the Board may in future create new taxes by majority under the rather transparent disguise of a “ contribution ” for some special outlay incurred. The objections of the Bussian Delegate to the creation of any such tax as the one in question are explained in Dr. Clemow’s despatch No. 150 of the 28th November already referred to. The Bussian Delegate has further, under instructions from his Embassy, not only rejected the tax, but has entered a claim for the return of all sums thus collected from pilgrims of Bussian nationality. The Board will be called upon to decide upon this claim at the end of this ye-.r’s Haj, and Dr. Clemow asks tor instruc tions as to the attitude he should then maintain on this question. The claim is based on the existence of the Capitulations, under which no new tax can be imposed on foreign subjects without the consent of the Government interested. As the right of the Russian Government to appeal to the Capitulations can scarcely be questioned, as we may in future have to oppose attempts at new taxation on similar grounds, and as the amount to be returned will not be large (only about 1,000 pilgrims of Bussian nationality used the line last year), I propose, with your consent, to instruct Dr. Clemow to uphold the Bussian Delegate’s claim. Dr. Clemow further asks for fresh instructions in the question of the large advance for the Tebuk lazaret. I have pointed out above the principal points wherein this question offers difficulties. If the advance be made without compensation for loss of interest, the reduction of dues will be put in danger. If, on the other hand, the proposal be made to compensate the loss of interest by a 25 piastre tax on the pilgrims, the Turks twist the proposal into one for the creation of a tax to cover the capital outlay (not merely the loss of interest), and the Vice-President has even, as I understand, stated his desire to see similar new taxes imposed at Cameran, Abu-Saad, and elsewhere, to cover the cost of advances for the existing maritime lazarets. In other words, an attempt would be made by the Turkish Government to repudiate all responsibility for the cost of construction even of existing lazarets, and to throw 7 the cost on the pilgrims, and even the Bussian Delegate would support them in the event of the 25-piastre tax on the Hedjaz Bailway being imposed as a means of covering the capital outlay for the construction of the Tebuk lazaret. Under these circumstances, Dr. Clemow 7 is of opinion that it w r ould be better to refuse all advances from the Board’s funds for the lazaret of Tebuk. The purely interior character of the new line of sanitary defence, the fact that the Board’s reserve has been obtained by excessive taxation in the past on the maritime and terrestrial frontiers, and mainly from navigation; and the further fact that the reduction of dues w 7 ill he endangered by the advance of the large sum in question, are considerations which certainly tend to support this opinion. In view 7 of them and of the action of the Vice-President of the Board—action which has all the appearances of a breach of faith—I w 7 ould propose, whh your approval, to modify the instructions already given to Dr. Clemow, in conformity with your telegram of the 4th August, and to direct him to state at a suitable opportunity, both to the Board of Health and the Mixed Commission, that His Majesty’s Government continue to hold that the Hedjaz Bailway is a purely interior line of communication, and that consequently the Turkish Government and not the Board of Health is responsible for its sanitary defence; that in the event of its being established, by an entente between the Porte and the Powers, that that defence was to be put into the hands of the Board of Health, the cost of construction of the Tebuk lazaret w T ould be at the charge of the Turkish Government, as in the case of all other lazarets of the Empire; that the Board’s reserves have been obtained from unduly high taxation on the maritime and terrestrial frontiers, and mainly from navigation; that they cannot entertain any proposals for voting an advance from the Board’s reserves for this purely interior line until the reduction ofsanitar}^ dues has been carried into effect; and that, the decisions already taken laving been purely conditional and dependent on the sanction of all the interested parties, they maintain complete liberty of action in regard to such proposals when made, whether in the Mixed Commission or elsewhere. I have requested Dr. Clemow to furnish me with a statement as to the outlay already incurred by the Board of Health for this year’s temporary lazaret at Tebuk, and with figures which may indicate, as closely as possible, the probable product of the 25-piastre tax in this year’s Haj and in future years. I shall not fail to forward that statement and those figures when received. With regard to the other question dealt with in Dr. Clemow’s despatch No. 11— the creation of a camp outside Jeddah, and the creation of a new tax to cover the cost—I shall have occasion to refer to this again in another despatch. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) GEE A HD LOWTHER. In closure 1 in No. 1. » Dr. Clemow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 11.) Sir, Constantinople, January 15,1909. I REGRhT to have to report that, owing to my unavoidable absence from the meeting of the Board of Health on Tuesday, two decisions of far-reaching importance were taken which would certainly not have been taken had I been present. In each instance advantage was taken of my absence by interested members to carry decisions that I had successfully combated before, and which were irregular and ultra vires. The first decision was to apply immediately the surtax of 25 piastres on pilgrims returning by the Hedjaz Bailway. This matter was very fully dealt with in my despatch No. 150 of the 28th November last. While we are prepared to accept that surtax, others, particularly the Bussian Delegate, are not; and, as I pointed out in the despatch referred to, their right to object must be fully admitted. “ Not to admit this right,” I added, “ would be to open up dangerous possibilities in connection with future proposals of the Board to levy fresh taxes—to which we might object— elsewhere.” None the less, the Board, in spite of the Bussian Delegate’s protest, has applied this new tax by majority; and this in spite of the fact that my opinions on the point had been clearly expressed in the note communicated to the Board on the 1st December (copy of which was inclosed in my No. 153 of the 3rd December), and of the fact that no later than at last week’s meeting of the Board I had successfully vetoed the Vice-President’s attempt to apply the tax by a majority vote. It will be recalled that the object of the deputation to the Grand Vizier on the 10th October was to obtain the consent of the railway authorities to co-operate with the sanitary authorities in the scheme of sanitary defence. It was made perfectly clear that, with regard to the 25-piastre surtax, the railway would only be asked whether it would consent to collect the tax in the event of the Mixed Commission advancing the large sum for the permanent lazaret. The request was purely hypothetical, and only the Mixed Commission could impose a tax of the kind. The second decision taken by the Board relates to the proposal of the Austrian Delegate to construct a camp for pilgrims outside Jeddah, and to levy a new tax on these pilgrims to cover the cost of this camp and of the sanitation of the town of Jeddah during the pilgrimage. The decision to establish the camp and impose the tax was taken en principe by the Board, so that nothing definite has yet been done. The proposal was referred to in my despatch No. 134 of the 28th October last, and the details will be found in the Minutes of the Board for the 7th July, 1908. I have to beg your Excellency’s instructions as to the attitude I am to maintain on this very important matter. Hitherto I have held that the sanitation of Jeddah or any other Turkish town is not within the competence of the Board of Health; that' if it be once admitted that our funds are to be used for the sanitation of Jeddah, the same must be admitted for the towns ot Mecca, Medina, Damascus, Constantinople, and any and every town through which the pilgrims pass; that the cost of the camp (through which from 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims would pass each year) would be enormous, far more than a new tax of 10 piastres could cover ; that we have not the right or power to keep the pilgrims, once they have passed [2170 A-1] B2through our k~* ■ M lodge the immense mass, and there w , , ^ strongly oppose any attempt tc proposed camp; that the inhabitants of in January prevent the pilgrims entering the town; th n ' p l0 r^“°t es of the meeting of the last that any such attempt woul ^ e ^ P t ^ t flna u y) it is not within the powers of the ^ Board of tlie 21st January, 19 ), , m,' cc ^ eme i s in fact, in my opinion, Board to impose any new taxation of an tlie poss ibility of unlimited calls an impracticable and dangerous on .

(E' 0, 16 -) Constantinople, January 22, 1909. ir ’ WITH reference to my despatch No. 11 of the 15th instant, I have the honour to report that the question of the application of the 25-piastre surtax on P^^^^ard of ini by the Hedpiz Bail way was briefly discussed at Tuesday s meeting of the Boaid Health, and was adjourned for a special meeting summoned for yesterday Yesterday’s meeting was a prolonged and stormy one. Ti e Vice-Biesile endeavoured to maintain that the Board had full power to take any decision it pleased even for the creation of new taxation or for any other purpose whatever, hj P maiority. This view I successfully combated. After a discussion, which ranged over many debatable and important points, the following decision was taken : “ Apres avoir entendu les motions et observations de MM. les Deleguds d’Angle- terre et de Bussie et apres avoir pris en consideration les discussions et decisions du Conseil a ce sujet, le Conseil partage en principe lopimon de ces messieurs pour sa propre incompetence a creer une nouvelle taxe; mais, considerant qu il s agit dans e cas 1 special d’une contribution provisoire destinee expressement a couvnr les frais dhnstallation du lazaret provisoire de Tehuk—frais mcomhant an Iresor Impena considerant d’autre part que ce mouvement financier nentre pas dans le Budget ordinaire des revenus du Conseil, et considerant enfin 1 urge nee de la prophylaxie sanitaire a etablir sur la nouvelle ligne ferree du Heajaz, le Conseil mamtient sa resolution an sujet de commencer la perception de ia contribution des piastres (or) pour cette annee, et passe a Tordre du jour.” This decision was the best that it was possible to obtain under the circumstances. It is satisfactory in that it lays down definitely that the Board is not competent^ to create new taxation. As first drafted the word sanitaire appeared after taxe in the phrase, “sa propre iacompetence a creer une nouvelle taxe. 1 obtained its suppression, and the necessity for doing so was shown by the fact that the Austrian Delegate then desired that it should be retained, in order, no doubt, that m the tax he wishes to levy at Jeddah for the proposed pilgrims’ camp—tax to which the term (i quarantenaire ” or some other adjective might he applied should be imposed bv simple majority oi the Board. , . On the other hand, the decision is unsatisfactory in that it leads to a certain danger of other taxes being imposed in future by the Board under the guise of a “ contribution,” or some other periphrasis. . The Bussian Delegate has, under instructions from his Embassy, not only rejected altogether the decision to apply the tax, but has entered a claim lor the return of all sums that will thus he gathered from pilgrims of Bussian nationality. Ibis claim, will have to be dealt with at the end of the season, when the number of suchas be to ay ;lie :iefj ills lug !ase iiv&amp; r to irn- 1 of .ent sed, iple iyer gle- du sa i le •ais *et lie sa or) ces. ; to ” in its rian .ture lilcb 1 ^ rtain of a ectei of ill claiw such i pilgrims becomes known. He bases this claim on the existence of the Capitulations y under which no new tax can be imposed on foreign subjects in Turkey without the consent of the Government interested. The point is one of the highest importance, and one in regard to which I have to beg your Excellency’s instructions as to the attitude I am to adopt. Another point of capital importance came out in the course of the discussion. The Vice-President, Ahmed Midhat Effendi, maintained, with great violence of language, that the product of the tax in question was intended from the beginning to cover the cost of building the lazaret, and not merely to cover the loss of interest on investments that the Board would suffer if the advance of £ T. 150,000 were made from its reserve. He stated that the Turkish Government would never accept such a proposal as the latter. It is, in fact, clear that he has represented to his Government that the proposal of the Board and of the Special Commission that travelled down the line in regard to this tax was of the character just named (ie., intended to cover the cost of building the lazaret), in spite of the fact that it has been repeatedly made clear that the tax was intended only to cover the loss of interest. Under these circumstances it appeared to me to be necessary to show extreme caution, and to prevent the Board from taking any decision in regard to the permanence of this tax—decision which might commit it to the view that the lazaret was to be built not at the charge of the Imperial Treasury (as in the case of all other lazarets), but at the charge of the pilgrims. I therefore made it clear that any decision to be taken had better refer solely to the outlay already incurred lor the temporary lazaret and be lor one year only. The proposals in regard to the permanent lazaret and the mode in which its cost is to be covered must be settled elsewhere, presumably in the Mixed Commission. # . . On this point also I have to beg your clear instructions. It is evident that the Turkish Government hold that the Board’s reserve is practically at their disposal for the construction of the Tebuk lazaret, and that the product of the 2o-piastie tax nill exonerate them from all responsibility for the cost of that construction; and that they will later repudiate all indebtedness to the Board for the advance in question. In spite of this they have already claimed (in the Tezkere, which formed the second inclosure in my No. 150, of*the 28th November last) that the lazaret will be the property of the State. . . On the other hand, I have stated both at the Board and in the Mixed Commission that His Majesty’s Government will not consent to the large _ advance for the permanent lazaret unless some compensating revenue be forthcoming for the loss of interest on investments in public funds that that advance would involve, llns was rendered necessary by the fact that an uncompensated advance from the Board’s reserve would render almost impossible a reduction in the sanitary dues upon which His Majesty’s Government lay the greatest stress. If the Turkish Government do not accept this condition, and endeavour to maintain that the capital outlay (not the loss ot interest) will be covered by the 25-piastre tax, I am of opinion that it would be preferable for us to refuse all advance of any kind. The reserve has been obtained from excess taxes on the maritime and terrestrial frontiers of Turkey, and mainly from navigation; the Board is responsible for the sanitary defence of those frontiers, and not for the interior sanitary defence of the countiy. onsequen y it would be doubly irregular and unjust to make the Board responsible ±or this new line of interior defence, and to make the cost of that defence (me uding constructions) fall on its funds. If the Turkish Government is responsible for the cost of construction of lazarets on the frontiers, which under existing Conventions are administered by the Board, it is impossible to admit that it is not responsible for the cost of lazarets on this purely interior line, with which the Board has nothing to do under existing Conventions.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith two despatches from the British Delegate on the Board of Health with regard to the sanitary defence of the Hediaz Hailway. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) GEBARD LOWTHER. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Dr. Clemow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 150.) Sir, Constantinople, November 28, 1908. WITH reference to previous correspondence on the subject of the sanitary defence of the Hedjaz Railway, I have the honour to report further as follows :— Recently M. Gaudin, the “ Directeur de TExploitation ” of the railway, spent some time in Constantinople, and advantage was taken of his presence to further the wish of the Board of Health to insure the co-operation of the railway authorities in the creation and working of the proposed lazaret at Tebuk. M. Gaudin drew up a note on the principal points involved, and expressed the fullest readiness on the part of his department to co-operate with the sanitary administration in this matter. Based to some extent on this and on the result of several interviews and conversations, it was decided to embody in a Memorandum, the main points on which the co-operation of the railway was desired, and this Memorandum was presented to the Grand Vizier on the 10th October. Copies of the Memorandum are inclosed herewith.* The principal points are summarized at the end; they are ten in number. The first —the most important—deals with the proposal to levy a surcharge on the price of tickets to cover the loss (in interest from investments in public funds) which the Board would incur if it advanced the £ T. 150,000 to the Government for the construction of the permanent lazaret. It was suggested that this surtax might be fixed at 25 piastres a-head, and the railway was asked, in the hypothetical event of the advance being made, whether ifc would consent to collect such a tax. The remaining points dealt in some detail with the desired co-operation of the railway in the matter of the collection of the quarantine dues, and in generally aiding in the erection both of the temporary and permanent lazarets, and in the effective working of the system of sanitary defence proposed. Since the date mentioned no reply was received until Tuesday last, when a Tezkere from the Grand Vizier, copy of which is inclosed herewith,* was read to the Board. This Tezkere states that an trade has sanctioned the proposals of the Council of Ministers, approving those of the Board of Health concerning the erection of the lazaret at Tebuk, and adds that the Hedjaz Railway Commission has been instructed to do what is required to aid the sanitary authorities. The Grand Vizier also states that the future lazaret, “ devant etre construit avec I’argent a avancer au Gouvernement Imperial,” will naturally be the property of the State, and adds that the Council of Ministers approves the proposed tax of 25 piastres “ a imposer a chaque pelerin pour faire face aux depenses de construction du lazaret,” on condition that indigent pilgrims are exempted from the tax. There are some inaccuracies of statement in this document to which I shall recur later. The Board decided to adjourn definite action in this matter, and to refer the Tezkere to the Lazarets Committee. Satisfaction was, however, felt at the readiness of the Railway Commission and the Government to aid in the work in question. * Not printed. [2129 o—l]Strong opposition, however, came from the Russian Delegate (supported also by the Austrian) in the matter of the proposed surtax of 25 piastres. There is a good deal of truth in the arguments he advances. I had at first suggested that the collectiono^ the tax should he begun forthwith, as a provisional measure, to cover the equgf^' provisional expenditure already incurred by the Board (in the form of advances) for * the temporary lazaret (as reported in previous despatches), and that the accounts both of the expenditure and of the income from the tax should be kept separately from the Board’s other accounts, both to be regulated later by the proper authority when the whole question becomes the subject of the desired entente between the Porte and the Powers. There would, however, be serious objection to such a course, and it is evident that the matter requires further careful consideration before the Board is committed to any definite action. The arguments advanced by the Russian Delegate are briefly as follows : The proposed advance of £ T. 150,000, or any other sum, to the Government for the construction of the Tebuk Lazaret does not differ essentially from those made for the other lazarets of the Empire. The Government will be responsible for their construc tion, and should he held to that responsibility. The other advances have been made without any compensating revenue to the Board. The proposal to levy the tax of 25 piastres on persons using the railway is equivalent to shifting the cost of construc tion from the shoulders of the Government to their shoulders, which he states he cannot admit. He threatens, indeed, to demand a generalization of the principle #(if adopted in this instance), and its application to the advance of £ T. 130,000 now proposed for the other lazarets, and to those made in the past for Camaran. He regards the proposal as involving grossly unequal treatment for pilgrims coming to the Hedjaz from the south and those coming from the north. A possible reply to such arguments is found in the following considerations : The existing lazarets are all maritime or frontier institutions, in which are applied the measures for which the Board is directly responsible under existing Conventions. The 23roposed Tebuk Lazaret, on the contrary, is an interior institution, for which the Board is in no way responsible, and the finance of which must be kept absolutely independent from that of the others just named. A mutual agreement to advance sums from the Board’s reserves without any compensating revenue for the former group of institutions is therefore possible; whereas, on the other hand, if the Board is to come to the Government’s aid for the new institution, it will be purely a titre exceptionnelj and under such conditions that the Board’s existing financial arrange ments do not suffer in consequence. Secondly, the revenue from the tax in question would not be intended to cover the cost of construction of the lazaret—and here the Tezkere of the Grand Vizier requires correction. The capital sum advanced would always be at the charge (presumably) of the Government, to be repaid by them. The revenue from the tax of 25 piastres would only be intended to make up to the Board the loss of income derived from interest on the sum advanced from its reserve in public funds (interest amounting to about 3|- per cent.). Thirdly, the principle must be maintained that the new institution must be financially self-supporting from the beginning, and not in any way supported by the income derived from the other existing branches of the service. But if the large advance be made, the other branches will suffer at once from the loss of income on their capital, unless some compensating revenue can be assured. If the Government would consent to pay 3J per cent, interest on the sum advanced the question would be settled at once. But there is practically no likelihood of their consenting to this. The only alternative, therefore, is to make those using the line pay an equivalent sum. To this, however, the Russian Delegate replies with some reason that in that event the advance would be made, not to the Turkish Government, but to the passengers on the line, who are in no way responsible for the construction of the lazaret in question. Eourthly, the railway line is a luxury, and not a necessary and sole route of arriving in the Hedjaz, as the old sea routes were. The old sea routes will still be open to all who wish to follow them. Those who choose the railway route may then well be called upon to submit to an admittedly new form of taxation. Eifthly, the proposed tax would not involve an invidious distinction between pilgrims from the south and north as alleged. The line is open to all who care to use it, and, as the inclosed Table shows,* is used by pilgrims from north, south, east, and west, though naturally those from the north predominate. * Not printed.While I think the above arguments may he held to justify the proposed new tax, the right of those whose pilgrims would be affected by it to protest against it, and even to refuse to accept it, if they deem it necessary to go so far, must, I think, be nitted. Not to admit this right would he to open up dangerous possibilities in connection with future proposals of the Board to levy fresh taxes—to which we might object—elsewhere. I have obtained from the Bureau de Controle of the Administration the details of the nationalities of the pilgrims returning by the Hedjaz Railway in the last pilgrim season, and they are shown in the Table inclosed.* It will be seen that the large majority were Turkish subjects (6,710 out of a total of 11,190, or just 60 per cent.) Bokhariots, Turkestanis, and Russian subjects together only amounted to 1,146, or about 10 per cent, of the whole. They were nearly equalled by the number of Egyptians (1,097); Indians only numbered 88. The number of passengers other than pilgrims is not known. Another error of detail in the inclosed Tezkere is found in the fact that it assumes that the proposed tax would be levied on pilgrims only. The intention of the proposal as originally made was that the tax should he levied on all passengers alike and not on pilgrims only; and, whatever the solution ultimately arrived at may be, it will be necessary to treat passengers and pilgrims on the same footing. I am already authorized by Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 8, Commercial, of the 4th August last, to raise the whole question in the Mixed Commission. I had hoped to obtain a settlement of the three points already nearing solution before raising this question, which may retard the application of the others. I still think it would he desirable, if possible, to endeavour to obtain the settlement of those points first. I doubt, however, whether it will be possible, as they will be to some extent affected by the new proposals concerning the Hedjaz Railway. On this point I shall have occasion to report again, and to make definite suggestions as to the course to be followed. In any case, it would seem to be desirable to ask that, if the question is to be settled by the Com mission Mixte, representatives of the railway should be invited to assist in the preliminary deliberations on this question.

I HAVE the honour to submit the following information as to the probable extent to which pilgrims will use the Medina-Damascus Railway for their return journey :— At the end of last pilgrimage the railhead was two days’ journey to the north of Medina ; 13,000 or 14,000 pilgrims appear to have used it for their return journey. Of these, about 10,000 were Turkish subjects, the great majority of them Syrians and Kurds, for whom the railway is much the shortest and quickest way home. Of the rest, about 2,000 or less were Russian subjects, and only 600 or 700, as 1 am informed, were Egyptians, the balance being miscellaneous, including some Indians for Jerusalem and Damascus, and some Persians. The Egyptian pilgrims numbered in all over 18,000, and it is certain that none, or very few, of the Egyptians would have gone home by the railway if the country to the west of Medina had not been so exceptionally unsafe. There is no sufficient reason to suppose that any Egyptians will use the railway after the pilgrimage which is now beginning, unless the present Egyptian rules of return tickets and quarantining at Tor are rescinded. There is not expected to be so large a pilgrimage of Ottoman subjects as the last. The Syrians and Kurds will of course return by the railway, especially as it has nowreached Medina itself. Aconsiderable number of Russian pilgrims will perhaps return by the railway, as they are not obliged to take return tickets from Russian ports to the Hejaz ; but, on the other hand, (1) most of the Russian pilgrims will probably take return tickets from Russian ports ; (2) the railway is disadvantageous, taking six days from Medina to Hejaz, Haifa, or Beirout, the fares being, first class, 750 piastres (110 piastres = H-) &gt; third class (there being no second), 375 piastres, only 50 kilog. baggage allowed free, and very heavy rates charged for excess baggage, and food and water being expensive, and sometimes difficult to get, whereas the journey to Zambo from Medina is only five days at (in this now commencing pilgrimage) 60 piastres per camel, able to cany two pilgrims with ^ In vfew of the aj^ove considerations, it seems improbable that more than 10,000 pilgrims will use the railway for the return journey if the Egyptian rules above referred to remain in force, and if they are rescinded it will only, I presume, be in a small proportion of the Egyptians that curiosity and other motives will prevail over the consideration of expense.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 96 of the 29th ultimo, I have the honour to report that, together with my Italian, Dutch and French co-Delegates, I have recently seen, quite unofficially, and conversed with two members of the Young Turk party here—Dr. Essad Pasha ^id Dr. Djenab Bey—and with Dr. Loutfi Bey, of Paris. As I had anticipated, there seemed to be a considerable lack of exact knowledge as to the financial and other arrangements in connection with the existing mechanism for the external sanitary defence of the Turkish Empire. I have, consequently, prepared a brief note on the subject, which was presented to the Board at last Tuesday’s meeting, and of which copies are inclosed herewith. In this note I have given a brief history of the Board of Health and of the Mixed Commissions, and have grouped the reforms that it appears desirable to introduce under the following four headings :— (a.) Purely sanitary questions ; (b.) Financial questions; (c.) Question of a “ Reglement Interieur ” of the Board and the Sanitary Ad ministration ; and (d.) Question of the attitude of Turkey towards the International Sanitary Conventions. I have pointed out that the reforms of the second group (financial) are already being considered by the Mixed Commission; those under the first and third headings may for the most part be carried out by the Board of Health. Particularly in purely sanitary matters the course marked out for the Board is a perfectly clear one. One of the four reserves under which Turkey was prepared to accept the Venice Convention of 1897 was the maintenance of the “Reglement” of 1867 (now entirely out of date), until [1974 cc—l] B. IP ; &gt;. &lt; it should have been modified by the Board of. Health and the modifications approved by the Porte. It only remains therefore for the Board to draw up a new “ Reglement, and this should be based upon the purely sanitary clauses of the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1903, and submitted to the Porte for its acceptance. ^ With regard to the fourth point, I have merely expressed a general “ voeu that Turkey may be brought into line with the other Powers by accepting that Convention. In recent meetings of Delegates, as also in the conversation with the above-nameu members of the Young Turk party, the opinion was very generally expressed that it was highly desirable that a new International Sanitary Conference be held in Constantinople in order to draw up a new Convention acceptable to Turkey. I have been careful to make it clearly understood, when this proposal has been brought forward, that I was quite unable to state whether His Majesty’s Government would regard such a proposal with favour ; that, when the holding of such a Conference was suggested to deal with the question of the sanitary defence of the Hedjaz Railway, they did not regard the proposal with favour ; and that, in any case, I felt sure they would not consent to the reopening of important questions already decided, or to the putting into the melting-pot the Paris Convention of 1903—an instrument which represents an agreement come to after very great difficulty, and as the result of mutual concessions on all sides. I have also added that, in my opinion, even if the holding of such a Conference in Constantinople w T ere agreed to, it would be useless to hold it for some considerable time—until the new Government in Turkey has taken on a more definite form than at present, and until its attitude towards international questions in general and international sanitary questions in particular is more clearly defined. In the meantime there would be a vast amount of preliminary work to be done, and there are innumerable reforms which the Board of Health and Mixed Commission can themselves introduce in the sanitary service here without further delay. I shall probably have occasion to recur to this question in a later despatch ; but I venture now to express strong doubt as to whether the holding, in Constantinople or elsewhere, of a Conference in which all the Powers of the world were represented, would be the best means of arriving at the desired end, that is to say, the production of a Convention that Turkey would unreservedly accept. A very large portion of the existing Conventions deal—more particularly in connection with the Moslem pilgrimage —with measures to be applied on Turkish soil and by r I urkish officials ; and I gather that Turkey rather resents the idea of all the Powmrs of the world—five-sixths of whom have no interest in the pilgrimage—dictating to her the measures to be applied in this connection. She does not, I gather, object to the Board of Health imposing such measures, as she is strongly represented on it, and as the foreign members exist there by virtue of the fact that their Governments contribute (through their respective navigations, pilgrims, &amp;c.) to the expenses involved. The suggestion has been made— not yet as a definite proposal, but rather as the result of discussions in recent meetings of the foreign Delegates on the Board—that a Conference might usefully be held to deal solely with the question of the sanitary control of the pilgrimage, and composed solely of* Representatives of the Powers directly interested in the pilgrimage. Those Powers may be quickly named ; they are : Great Britain (and India), Turkey (and Egypt), Persia, Holland, Russia, and France. There is certainly need for revising the existing Regulations in connection with the pilgrimage (in connection, for instance, with the control of pilgrims from the north, and with the sanitary defence of the Hedjaz Railway, &amp;c.), neither of which is dealt with by existing Conventions. Should this suggestion ever take the form of a definite proposal, it would presumably involve the removal of the clauses dealing with the pilgrimage from the existing Paris Convention, and their incorporation (with the required modifications) in a new Convention signed solely bv the above-named Powers. There would seem, at first sight, to be not a little to be said in favour of such a course. Another point which has prevented Turkey from accepting the Paris Convention is the proposal to modify the composition of the Constantinople Board of Health. It must be doubted whether she will ever consent to the reduction of the number of Turkish members of the Board from eight to four. In the unlikely event of her ever doing so, she would probably demand that powers which contribute practically nothing to the Board’s funds, such as Spain, Sweden, Belgium, the United States, should cease to be represented on the Board. A third point which appears to have interfered with Turkey’s acceptance of the Paris Convention is that contained in Article 174 of the Convention, under which a Consular Commission would be created in Constantinople to deal with the application of fines for infringement of the Sanitary Regulations. It seems likely that Turkey will[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] I HAVE had under consideration the Memorandum which your Excellency was good enough to communicate to me on the 7th ultimo containing an inquiry as to whether His Majesty’s Government would be disposed to join in representations to the Turkish Government with a view to inducing them to adhere to the Paris Sanitary Convention, in view of the altered situation in regard to sanitary matters which has been created by the opening of the Hedjaz Railway. 1 have the honour to state that the view taken by His Majesty’s Government of this suggestion is that a request to the Turkish Government to adhere to the Paris Sanitary Convention would not, in their opinion, be opportune at the present moment, as this would appear to be a matter on which the Sultan might be at variance with his Government. When, however, the transition stage between the old and the new regimes has passed away and the new system of government is firmly established on the basis of a freely elected Parliament, His Majesty’s Government will be ready to join with the other Powers in representing to the Porte the expediency of adhesion to the Paris Convention, subject to such reserves as the Turkish Government may wish to make with regard to the constitution of the Constantinople Board. As soon as this occasion arises His Majesty’s Government will take the opportunity to propose a modification of those stipulations of the Convention which relate to the establishing of a sanitary station at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to add that instructions were given to the British Delegate on the Constantinople Sanitary Board on the 4th August last as to the attitude which he was to adopt in regard to the questions raised by the opening of the Hedjaz Railway. Dr. Clemow was authorized to raise the question of the establishment of a sanitary station on the railway, and was informed that if capital was required for the construc tion and initial expenditure entailed thereby, any such advance from the surplus at merely a loan, for the purpose, he was to reserve the rights of this country. I would further observe that, according to reports from Constantinople, there seems every prospect that the Mixed Commission wdll recommend a reduction of the sanitary dues on shipping by about 20 per cent. If the finances of the proposed sanitary station at Tebouk were to form a separate account, and if there was a firm J'rfo SP EASTERN SANITARY REFORM [October 0.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1, [ 31312 ] No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to M. Gambon. Your Excellency, Foreign Office October 6, 1908. the disposal of the Sanitary Board should take the form of a loan. He was further instructed to insist that the station should be self-supporting, and to satisfy His Majesty’s Ambassador as to the details of the scheme in the first instance. Dr. Clemow was further instructed that in the event of the Sanitary Board voting a grant, and not resolve to make the station self-supporting, allowing for interest on and redemption of the loan from the Board’s surplus, the reduction of the dues, to which the greatest importance is attached by the British shipping interest, would not be imperilled. His Majesty’s Government trust that the foregoing explanations will be of a nature to satisfy the French Government as to their attitude towards the proposal for the adhesion of Turkey to the Paris Convention.

Whitehall, September 26, 1908. ’ I AM directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 16th instant, transmitting, for their observations, a copy of a communication from the French Embassy with reference to the sanitary control of the Hedjaz Railway. The Board may observe that the adhesion of the Ottoman Government to the Paris International Convention of 1903 would entail the reorganization of the Constantinople Superior Board of Health in accordance with the terms of that Con vention. As a consequence, one of the two conditions attached by the British Government to their acceptance of a sanitary station at Ormuz would be satisfied, and only one reserve Avould remain in the way of the creation of that station. 1 he Board are advised, however, that this drawback would be more than compensated by the advantages that may be expected to accrue, both to the public health and to commerce, should the Ottoman Government adhere to the Convention of 1903 and carry out its provisions. It would seem desirable therefore to assist any step that would be likely to lead to this end, unless it were open to objection on political grounds. The Board are not in a position to judge what degree of success is likely to attend an appeal to the Ottoman Government on this subject by the Powers collectively; but it appears to the Board that any prospect of success, however small, would justify this procedure in the absence of objection on political grounds. But, although intervention of this kind by the Powers may be regarded as desirable, it appears to the Board to be very doubtful whether the suggestion that the Ottoman Government should be offered an advance of money from the funds at the disposal of the Constantinople Board of Health on the condition that Turkey shall adhere to the Convention of 1903, is a satisfactory way of approaching the question. It may perhaps eventually prove inevitable to provide from this source the means necessary for the sanitary control of the Hedjaz Railway, but the Board suggest that this should be a matter for negotiation in which the reduction of shipping dues, the possibility of which the French Ambassador seems to contemplate abandoning, should not be lost sight of. It appears to the Board that it would be preferable for the Powers to approach the Ottoman Government in the first instance on the ground that, in view of the greater danger of invasion of Europe by plague and cholera in consequence of the construction of the Hedjaz Railway, it is desirable, to an even greater degree now^ than it has been in the past that Turkey should adopt the more modern and more efficient methods of combating these diseases, embodied in the Paris Convention of 1903.

I defer making any comments on these despatches for the present, as the whole matter of the Tebuk Lazaret, dealt with in the first two and closely connected with the subject of the last-mentioned despatches, is still under my consideration. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) GERARD LOWTHER. , Inclosure 1 in No. I. Dr. Clemow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 84.) Sir, Constantinople, August 11, 1908. THE Lazarets Committee of the Board of Health met again recently, and presented a Report, of which polygraphed copies are inclosed herewith, to the Board at last week’s meeting. It will be seen, from the last paragraph of the Report, that the Committee proposed an immediate advance of 25,550 fr. (over 1,000/.) for the construction of a portable pavilion for the disinfecting stoves, and house for the staff, for this year’s Haj at the improvised lazaret of Tebuk, on the Hedjaz Railway. This sum does not include the expense of sending to Tebuk an employe of the French firm who are supplying the houses. The Board accepted the proposal of the Committee on these points. I then, in accordance with my instructions, made the following reserve: That, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, whatever measures are taken this year for the sanitary defence of the line must be regarded, as in the last two seasons, as purely provisional and as not affecting in any way the definitive solution of this problem ; that a fresh entente on this point is essential in order to arrive at such financial arrangements as shall make this new branch of the sanitary service self-supporting from the beginning ; and that in the meantime any deficit that may result from the measures now taken must be at the charge of the Turkish Government, so as not to cause any financial loss to the branches already existing. The earlier portions of the inclosed Report deal with the following—equally important—matter. It will be recalled that the Mixed Commission, at its third meeting, fixed the sums required for putting in complete repair each of the lazarets of the Turkish Empire. The total of these sums, as then fixed, amounted to some £ T. 83,000. Since that date (the exact figures will be found in my despatch No. 52 of the 8th June, 1905) various Commissions of the Board of Health have paid visits of inspection to all the more important lazarets, and, as the result of their reports to the Board, it has been found necessary to modify considerably the sums to be asked for [1919 hh—l] Bi : ^ ' I ! V t } : \ i »¥ r t many of them. This the Lazarets Committee has done, and the modified figures will be found in the inclosed Report. They may be summarized as follows :— Name of Lazaret. Sum asked in 1905. Sum now asked. Sinope £ T 3,800 £ T. 24,000 Monastir-Aghzi 900 1,500 Ciazomene .. 5,380 6,000 Beyrout 3,190 15,000 Tripoli (Barbary) 1,000 1,000 Abu-Saad (Jeddah) 6,375 f 22,500 } ( (at least) ) 12,000 Camaran .. 33,000 Bussorah 20,000 20,000 Khanikin 5,750 5,750 In 1905, also, a sum of £ T. 6,400 was asked for for the creation of disinfecting pavilions at the following places: Trebizond, Salonica, Yanbo, Yalona, and Kizil-Dize. The Lazarets Committee proposes no modification in this sum, but, in accordance with a decision of the Board taken some months ago, proposes to add to the list of ‘‘creations” a disinfecting pavilion at Benghazi at a cost of £ T. 1,250. This brings the total cost of “creations” to £ T. 7,650, and that of “improve ments” to £ T. 118,250. These together make a sum of £ T. 125,900, and the Committee proposed to fix the sum to be asked a qui de droit at the round figure of £ T. 130,000. The Board accepted this proposal. I accepted this portion of the Report without reserve. I have been a member of all the Commissions of Inspection of the different lazarets, and have satisfied myself of the real necessity of spending the sums in question. The total sum of £ T. 130,000 had alread} 7 been foreseen as the probable sum to be asked for, as shown in my note to the last meeting of the Mixed Commission, copies of which were inclosed with my despatch No. 70 of the 27th ultimo. The other portions of the inclosed Report deal with certain works to be immediately undertaken at the lazarets of Sinope, Beirout, Camaran, and Monastir Aghzi., At Sinope there is urgent need of providing temporary accommodation for a large number of pilgrims during^ the coming Haj, in order to avoid, if possible, a repetition of last year’s disastrous incidents in connection with the steam-ship “Gregory Merck.” The Board has agreed to the proposals of the Lazarets Committee, to advance about £ T. 2,000 for the immediate construction of seven temporary barracks for pilgrims, the repair and completion of the landing stages, the construction of a breakwater, and the repair of some of the old barracks. If the contract for the permanent works at this lazaret are given to the same architect, he consents to deduct the sum of £ T. 558 from the above sum, for value of the material employed in the new temporary barracks. I did not see my way to oppose this advance, as the Sinope lazaret in its present state is utterly inadequate to the calls likely to be made on it, and it will be impossible to carry out the permanent works of improvement (recommended by the Inspection Committee that recently visited the lazaret) in time for this year’s Haj. It should be added that, apart from the construction of the seven temporary barracks, the other works to be put in hand at once are included in the recommendations of the Inspection Committee, and their cost is included in the sum of £T. 21,000, which, as stated above, is to he asked for for this lazaret. It will be observed that all the proposals of the Inspection Committee (whose Report was presented to the Board on the 1 4th July) have been accepted by the Lazarets Committee and by the Board. The other proposals of the Committee, in connection with the lazarets of Beyrout, Camaran, and Monastir-Aghzi, deal with relatively minor points, to which it is unnecessary to refer in detail. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) E. G. CLEMOW.than this. I therefore consented to the above arrangement, as finally (after many counter-suggestions had been made) proposed by the Sub-Committee, while still main taining the view that a 25 per cent, reduction could be effected without danger to the Board’s finance. No further advance m this matter can be made until the next plenary meeting of the Commission, and the political crisis seems likely to cause serious delay in the holding bf that meeting. Hakki Bey, the President of the Mixed Commission, has been appointed Minister of Public Instruction, and it is uncertain whether he can continue to act as President of the Mixed Commission as well, as that body comes under the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency has, however, expressed a strong wish to retain the presidency, and hopes to obtain the consent of his colleagues to his doing so. It will be unfortunate it he is not able to do so, as he is now intimately acquainted with the details of the questions before the Commission, which his successor would not be. In the meantime I shall be glad to have your Excellency’s consent to my accepting in the plenary meeting the above proposal of the Sub-Committee. I find that in practice the reduction would be over 20 per cent, for all ships up to 4,000 tons. For larger ships it would be slightly less, but even in a ship of 10,000 tons the reduction would be over 19 per cent. The following figures show how the proposed reduction would work out in practice in the case of ships of various tonnage :— Tonnage of Ship. Dues under existing Tariff. Dues under proposed Tariff. Difference. Percentage reduction. 500 Piastres. 250 Piastres. 187£ Piastres. 621 sji 25 1,000 400 312^ 21 875 2,000 600 475 125 20-83 3,000 800 6371 1621 20-31 4,000 1,000 800 200 20-00 5,000 1,200 9621 2371 19-8 0,000 1,400 1,125 275 19 -65 10,000 2,200 1,775 425 19-32 As ships above 4,000 tons are comparatively rare in Turkish waters, the reduction in practice will probably prove to be something appreciably over the 20 per cent.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 594 of the 18th September, 1907, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah, reporting on the progress of the Hedjaz Railway. I ndATP rVT* (Signed) ’ N. R. O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Consul Monahan to Sir N. O'Conor. (No. 3.) Sir, Jeddah, February 3, 1908. WITH reference to my telegram of the 30th ultimo, I have the honour to submit the following information respecting the progress of the Hedjaz Railway :— Work is being done from Medina (where the foundation-stone of a station was laid with much ceremony on the 6th October, 1907), as well as from the present rail head about 100 miles from that town, and the railway is expected to be completed to Medina by next autumn. Erom Medina it appears to have been decided to prolong it to Mecca Via Rabigh and Jeddah, which route is not only free from serious engineering difficulties but well supplied with water ; whereas the eastern or highland route from Medina to Mecca, also free from serious engineering difficulties, lacks water. Rahigh is a small town of about 3,000 inhabitants, 3 miles from the sea and about 70 miles to the north of Jeddah. The Bay of Rabigli is thus described in the “ Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot,” 1900, p. 264: “An inlet about 2 miles long, affording excellent anchorage inside its entrance in from 8 to 12 fathoms, perfectly sheltered from all winds and easy of ingress and egress to sailing-vessels when north-westerly winds are blowing. In the entrance are from 18 to 20 fathoms, and immediately outside no bottom within 30 fathoms. Rabigh is a sacred spot to Mussulman pilgrims, who here disrobe and put on the white garh of pilgrims” [be., those pilgrims who come by the caravan route from Medina to Mecca]. The Government is already makingVrrangements for steamers to bring railway material to Rabigh, and a pier is, it is said, to be built there. The Bedouins interested in camel transport between Medina and the coast, and between Medina and Mecca, appear to have taken alarm. Kiazim Pasha, the Mushir n charge of the whole of the Hedjaz Railway construction, came to Medina about a month ago. On the 10th or 11th of January, he was proceeding from Medina to Rabigh with a large escort, said to have been of over 1,000 cavalry, when he was attacked at Bir-al-Mashi, 10 hours from Medina, by Bedouins of the Beni Amar clan of the Auf tribe, who killed eight or nine soldiers and wounded some, and themselves lost three killed. It is said that he returned to Mecca on the 14th (Bairam day) and there took part in the Bairam ceremonies and telegraphed to the Palace, and that Constantinople has promised him a force of 30,000 men, including cavalry and infantry and sappers and miners, to push on the line and punish the Bedouins. He is now back in camp at Bir-al-Mashi. The pilgrim route from Yambo to Medina was for some time closed in consequence of the above incident, Kiazim Pasha having imprisoned eight Sheikhs of those parts, which exasperated the Bedouins; but it has now been reopened, he having released the Sheikhs by order from Constantinople, and the first caravan, a large one of 6,000 camels, is about to start or has already started from Yambo. [2829 aa- ib ' /. v ?;nT The Sheikh of Rabigh, the virtual local governor, is said to be in favour of the Government’s railway project, as Rabigh and his small tribe, which is in its yicinity, would benefit from the increased importance of that town and district. Jeddah town will lose from the railway, as the pilgrims will merely pass through without stopping, and as the import of wheat and barley by sea will be greatly diminished. Imported barley, a food of the pilgrimage camels, will be very much less needed in the Hediaz.^6 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] published a letter from its Constantinople correspondent, stating that the Directors of the Hedjaz Railway have made an arrangement with the German geologist, Dr, Blankenkorn, to proceed to Palestine on behalf of the Company in order to prospect for petroleum in the Dead Sea Basin. . . After he has concluded the examination of this district, the scientist will proceed southwards and examine the mineral wealth of the country traversed by the Hedjaz line. It is hoped that important results may come of Dr. Blankenkorn s expedition^ as the Arabian coast to the south of the Gulf of Akabah was known in antiquity as being ASIATIC TURKEY.

I HAVE the honour to report to your Excellency that the Imperial Commission sent from Constantinople for the inauguration of that section of the Hejaz Railway constructed during the last year since the 1st September, 1906, arrived here on the 22 nd ultimo, and after stopping in this city five days started on the 2&lt; th on two trains to Medain-Salih and El-Ola, where they held the inauguration ceremonies on the 1 st instant, the anniversary of the Sultan’s Accession Day, and returned the next day, entraining for Haifa. They will later proceed from Beirout via Aleppo and Erekli to Constantinople. The Commission consists of Ferik Auler Pasha, Ferik Jevad Pasha, Ismail Hakki Bey, and Ali Nouri Bey, the last two being sons of his Excellency the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs. They were accompanied to their destination at El-Ola by Mushir Kyazim Pasha, Nazir of the Construction, Mushir Ali Riza Pash, Nazir of Traffic, Abdurrahman Pasha Muhafizul-Hajj, and about 100 others of dignitaries and officials. Since the 1 st September, 1906, the rails have been laid from Pebouk to El-Ola, which is about 30 kilom. south of Medain-Salih. The stations, building or proposed, on this section are : Tebouk (692nd kilom.), Wadi Athel (720th kilom.), Darul-Haj (744th kilom.), Mustabka (755th kilom.), Hamis (782nd kilom.), Dezad (805th kilom.) Moaddem (828th kilom.), Hishm-Sana (853rd kilom.), Dar-el-Hamra (880th kilom.), El-Mutaab (904th kilom.), Abu-Taker (918th kilom.), El-Mushim (930th kilom.), Medain-Salih ( 953 rd kilom.), and El-Ola (about 980th kilom.). The earthworks on 40 kilom. beyond El-Ola are being completed, while 44 kilom. more are prepared for work as regards plans and profiles. From the other end, at Medina, 4 kilom. are already finished and 46 kilom. are being laid out. The number of troops working on the line from this side to El-Ola and beyond is about 5,000, while three battalions are working at the other end from Medina, all being in good health and receiving their pay regularly. The stations are not built yet, except at Hamis, where a blockhouse is nearly finished, and in a few other places the foundations have been laid and cisterns for water constructed. At El-Moaddem there is an ancient reservoir which contains in its present condition 11,000 cubic metres of water, but if it would be cleaned and repaired it will have a capacity of 16,000 cubic metres. According to an opinion expressed by the Mushir Kyazim Pasha, Nazir of Construction, the troops between Medain and El-Ola could lay down 4 kilom. of rails in one day. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. P.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the translation of an article in the previous article to which it refers was on much the same lines, but gave far less interesting details. (Translation.) WITH regard to the report from Constantinople published in the “Cologne Gazette” of the 25th July, the following details concerning the construction of the Hedjaz line are perhaps of interest:— The construction, which was officially commenced on the 1st September, 1900, and will consequently shortly finish its seventh year, will then have to show an from Deraa to Haifa, on the Mediterranean (161 kilom.), built in 1903-6, also belongs to this railway; there have been, therefore, 1,011 kilom. built in seven years, which means a yearly average construction of 148 kilom., which corresponds to Geheimrat von Kapp’s rough calculation of 150 kilom. Herr von Kapp, at the immediate instance of the Sultan, after travelling over the first part of the line, sent in a Report in 1901, laying down the principles for the organization and subsequent construction of the line, and in 1905 undertook another journey and produced another Report. Already in the first Report he referred both to the indispensableness of the connection with Haifa, and the advisability of the extremely difficult connection of Maan with Akaba, in the first place at least as a strategic road, and above all to the idea of constructing a line from the south, he., from Jeddah via Mecca to Medina. Only the line to Haifa was constructed. The branch line Maan-Akaba, for the construction of which an Trade was issued in the autumn of 1904, fell through in consequence, it is said, of the objections of an Embassy at Constantinople, and the useful and important connection between .Jeddah and Mecca (75 kilom.) also fell through owing to the fears of certain Constantinople cliques of a possible coup de mam against Mecca before that town was connected with the north by rail and therefore defendable. In the meanwhile, however, measures were taken to carry out the foundations of the line at least from Mecca to Medina, so that the materials arriving from the north can be pushed on from Medina to Mecca in a comparatively short time. As Medina is roughly 1,450 kilom., and Mecca 1,850 kilom. from Damascus, there remain on the 1st September, 1907, 500 and 900 kilom. still to build, i.e., the line has nearly reached half-way to Mecca. It can be finished as far as Medina in 1910, and as far as Mecca in 1913, and the latter date can be advanced by a year if the loundations from Mecca to Medina are really laid in the next three or four years. In any case, the work accomplished up till now by Turkey is a very admirable effort, which shows what that country is capable of doing in a given case, and proves what sensible strategical and political interest the Sultan and the leading men in ASIATIC TURKEY. [August 19.] CONFIDENTIAL Section 3. i; [27663] No. 1. S’ir F. Lascelles to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 19.) (No. 358.) Sir, Berlin, August 14, 1907.

Extract from the “ Cologne Gazette,” of August 5, 1907. The Hedjaz Railway. advance from Damascus to the south of about 850 kilom. In calculating the average of work accomplished, the fact must not be overlooked that the difficult branch line 12607 f—3]2 l | \ I , \ Turkey take in this railway. For it is a question in the last resort of insuring the possession of the holy cities of Medina and Mecca. The idea has already been expressed more than once of making the Red Sea an Egyptian inland sea by annexing its eastern shore to Egypt, and, by taking possession of the holy cities, of possibly, seeing the Khalifate handed over to the Khedive or to a subservient Emir of Mecca There is also the idea that the rebellious tribes in Yemen might become dangerous' from the south. In any case, these fears are the mainsprings for the unusually large sums given by the Turks and other Mahommedans for the Hedjaz Railway. On the 1st September, 1906, these sums amounted to 57,000,000 fr., and they must have risen in the course of this year by about 10,000,000 fr., so that the financial backing of the railway seems assured. The real author and driving force of this great work, is, apart from the Sultan, His Majesty’s Second Secretary and Chamberlain, Izzet Pasha, to whose first-rate ability, indefatigable power of work, and iron energy, the present success of the scheme is chiefly due. It must not be forgotten that the technical manager of the construction is the German engineer, Meissner Pasha, who has spent his whole career from foreman to Chief Engineer on the railways built in Turkey under the direction of Geheimrat von Kapp, and was, therefore, specially suited for this post. Germany, who has never concealed her friendship for Turkey and her interest in her strengthening at home and abroad, can only greet the success of this great work with pleasure, and wish it a successful conclusion undelayed by difficulties from within or without.

Under Secretary 2 ; Secretary of State flnmrmft Aft 2Cf 27 - , Under Secretary 'l/U. 4 Secretary of State — —/-Ar ^ -—- Copy to \vM^ x Sc(UsJ^ '&lt;&gt;7■'ll There are also some 450 Italian, Greek, Montenegrin, and other Christian workmen, who construct station buildings, bridges, tunnels, and other more difficrdt labour, soldier labour being confined to simple earthwork, cuttings, and the laying of the^ permanent way. Efforts have been made to instruct soldiers in masonry bridge work, with some success, as a special bridging company can now construct culverts up to 10 feet. The Medina garrison, comprising some 3,000 men, has recently commenced earth work from Medina, under superintendence of Turkish Engineer officers, but no bridge^ work has been attempted, or raiJs laid. It will probably be found impossible to dispense entirely with the Italian or European workmen and contractors, and they will carry on their part of the work right up to Medina, or even Mecca. Tebuk, which has a plentiful water supply, is being made into a large depot, similar to Maan. Another depot will be made at El Ula (just south of Medain-i-Salih), a small town, with a plentiful water supply, and finally a depot will be made in Medina. All efforts are now being directed to reach Medina, and it is hoped in sixteen months’ time, he., in September 1908, the line will be completed thus far. It is not proposed to at once continue the line from Medina to Mecca, but to complete other projects, such as the construction of a sheltered port at Haifa, the construction of the Jeddah-Mecca line for the use of the Indian pilgrims, and some short branches in Syria, which will be likely to pay and bring in revenue. When this programme has been carried out, the construction of the Medina-Mecca line will be considered further. These proposals do not take into account the bitter hostility of the Arabs, and the possibility of an attack by Ibn Rashid from Hail, which is only eight days’ march from Akhdar or Muadhem, or by Ibn Saoud, the Emir of Nejd, both of whom see their independence threatened by the advance of the line. Even now work has been stopped temporarily at the Medina end, and several raids on the construction parties have been made near Akhdar by hostile Arabs, while individual soldiers, who stray but a short distance from their working parties, are robbed or killed. Between Medina and Mecca the powerful tribe of the Beni Harb will not even permit of the construction of the telegraph between those places, much less the railway. The policy of the Turks is to pay the various Sheikhs along the line an annual subsidy to prevent attacks by their tribesmen, and this serves fairly well for the large tribes of Ad wan and Beni Sakhr between Damascus and Maan, but those farther south are more difficult to control, and have far more power of mischief. Station buildings south of Tebuk are loopholed for defence, with a store of water and provisions to resist attack. In this connection must be noted the very large and increasing importation of rifles in recent years into Syria and Arabia. The principal weapon thus imported is the Martini. The Druzes, the people of the Hauran, the Lebanon, and the great Bedouin tribes south-east of Damascus, obtain rifles from Syrian ports, while the Bedouins of north west Arabia get them in from numerous small inlets on the Red Sea coast. The result of this has been that every Arab in the interior has his Martini with belt full of cartridges which he is able to refill from local resources, and thus finds himself as well armed as the Turkish troops. This applies not only to Arabia, but also to the Hauran, the Lebanon, and the districts close round Damascus. Arab raiding parties from the Shammar or Nejd can cover great distances, 60 to 70 miles in the day by mounting two men on a camel, and these might readily attack the scattered working parties on the railway, cut off the water supply, and destroy depots before the slow moving infantry detachments could be concentrated. Water being everything, and only found at long intervals, detachments would be in danger of perishing of thirst. Military Organization of Construction Works. The parties at railhead comprise three battalions of Nizam infantry and two railway battalions kept up to the full strength of 5,000 men by constant small drafts.These number 50 to 80 by each train, and do little more than replace the great wastage caused by sickness, the returning trains being crowded with sick from jailhead. ^ The organization is by companies, each having a particular section allotted to it under its own officers. The infantry do the ordinary earthwork, cuttings, embankments, &amp;c. Contractors and foreign workmen, Italians, Greeks, &amp;c., do station buildings, ^^dges, culverts, tunnels, and difficult rock cuttings. The railway battalions lay the actual permanent way of rails and sleepers. Stone is plentiful all along the line, and is used for bridges and station buildings. Wood beams for roofing have to be imported through Haifa. Iron bridges or ironwork are not used at all now. The Bedouin take no part whatever in the building of the line, but on the contrary are hostile, and cut off stragglers when they can. The drafts usually wear their ordinary civilian clothes, and have received no military training ; but their work on the line counts as military service, and they receive a certain amount of drill while there. The railway battalions have become expert in the laying of the permanent way, and can average 2 to 3 kilom. a day, and have done even 4 kilom. on special occasions. One company has been trained under European instructors in masonry work, and can now build culverts up to 10 feet. The men now receive extra pay, in addition to their ordinary pay as soldiers, calculated by piece work at the following scale :— 1 cubic metre of earth .. 1 cubic metre of rock .. Collecting- 1 cubic metre of stones Spreading 1 cubic metre on the railway Piastre. 1 2 2 1 This is found more satisfactory than payment at military rates by the day. The extra pay is issued fairly regularly, and a man can accumulate a sum of 15Z. or 201. at the end of his period of three years, a satisfactory sum in this country, and an important inducement to recruits. This extra pay comes from the Hejaz Railway fund, while the military pay is issued by the administration of the Vth Army Corps at Damascus, and is usually very many months in arrear. South of Maan, all employes get an extra rate of pay; thus, for an ordinary workman on the permanent way this is 150 piastres a-month with other rates in proportion. A special commissariat administration has been formed, with headquarters at Damascus, to supply the troops at railhead. This becomes an increasingly difficult problem, as there appears no chance of procuring any supplies in the country itself. Live sheep, for instance, have to be sent from Amman to Tebuk and the desert stations at railhead, a distance of nearly 300 miles, during which the animals suffer much and lose flesh. The principal store depot is now at Tebuk. The food supplied is bread or biscuit (“ peksemed,”) rice and sugar, with meat only at rare intervals. The want of vegetables is severely felt. The actual quantity of provisions is just sufficient, but the quality of flour sent from Damascus is very bad. Sickness is rife, dysentery, typhoid, and scurvy, brought on by the lack of green vegetables and want of suitable food when working hard in such a hot climate, are prevalent. Green vegetables might be grown at Tebuk oasis, as the Italian engineers have proved, but nothing is done to supply the troops in this way. As a contrast, the Italians and other foreign workmen support the climate well, their food being supplied by their own contractors. Military hospitals of 150 beds are to be constructed at Tebuk and El Ula, and that at Tebuk is approaching completion. There is a temporary hut hospital at Maan of 150 beds, while the worst cases are sent on to Damascus. The sick are sent up the line in open platform waggons without medical attendance of any sort. The Maan-Akaba route is always kept open for the passage of troops to embark at Akaba for the Yemen, and was being used this spring. A special commissariat depot is maintained in Maan, and one company of infantry with a post of zaptiehs is in garrison there. The present garrison of Akaba is one anda-half battalions of tbe Hejas Division, and three posts are maintained on the Akaba route of fifty men each, the distance being as follows :— Maan .. Fuele .. Gruera .. Abul Hairan Akaba .. At Guera is a telegraph office and a larger post of eighty men. The first stage to Fuele is a gradual ascent from Maan, the post being on the crest (4,625 feet). Several small springs exist in the vicinity, and Roman remains testify that the district was formerly inhabited. The second stage includes the very steep descent of an escarpment some 800 feet high—a continuation of the Batn-el-Ghrul. Guera is in a wide and nearly waterless plain, and possesses a small spring near the post. A few shrubs and some vegetation exist here in spring. The last stages are down the Wadi Ithm to Akaba, a valley about a mile wide with rocky sides in which a few small springs are found. • Feeling against Christian Employes. Throughout the Administration there is a certain feeling of antagonism to Christian employes, and the idea obtains that the line should be worked entirely by Moslems. This feeling is not exactly due to fanaticism, but rather to the conflict of Eastern methods with Western, and to a desire to get rid of Western influence, at any rate, in the Arabian sections. In the Construction Department it is generally admitted that Meisner Pasha is indispensable, although he has not been permitted to survey farther south than Medain-i-Salih. Now, however, that his contract has been renewed he will doubtless be allowed to go south as construction advances. Mukhtar Bey, whom I met at Deraa, has studied the country towards Medina, but scarcely seemed capable of any but a subordinate position. In the Traffic Department, M. Gaudin (now Gaudin Pasha), although energetic, does not seem to have the same tact in dealing with the higher Turkish officials as Meisner Pasha ; several of his European assistants have resigned because their position w^as made intolerable and the Turkish subordinate officials would not carry out the orders of a Christian. Although M. Gaudin was, when first appointed, given full powers, he is now entirely under Riza Pasha, with whom he does not get on, and consequent confusion results. The Turkish officials find their posts can be made very lucrative in many ways. Even booking clerks gain a good deal in such ways as refusing to find room for merchants’ goods on the train unless heavily bribed. The stations in the Hauran, whence a large export of wheat is possible, are still encumbered with piles of sacks of last year’s wheat. Trains, even on the short run between Haifa and Damascus, are often hours late for no reason ; long, meaningless stoppages being made at every small station. Turkish administrators seem incapable of grasping the idea of management and forethought required in working a railway.- There is practically no reserve of coal which all comes from oversea, mostly from Cardiff ; on one occasion the supply ran out owing to a steamer being late, and the line ceased working for forty-eight hours until coal was borrowed from the French line and the bunkers of a passing steamer. The extraordinary confusion at Deraa wffien trains arrive is another object lesson. Moslem engine-drivers whose fatalistic ideas are unsuited to such a profession, and scamped workmanship on the part of Belgian and German engine making firms make the life of an engine a short one, perhaps four or five months at most before it has to go to the repairing shops ; certainly the works at Maan, Deraa, and Haifa are full of engines awaiting repairs brought on largely through ignorance and neglect. Some Christian drivers still remain and their number will probably have to be increased.5 0 (I ? on tie remain des tie of tie ognear Iristian ms. rate,in 'asla is I tkn ubtless na, but rgetic, :ia]sas nsition * at tie q full i, and ? rays. l for still t run igless t and ■from .d tie dline rvien n,and make aas to full of Som e d. Terminus and Depots and Repairing Shops. New terminus and repairing works at Damascus .—It lias now been decided tbat Damascus and not Deraa shall be the head-quarters of the Administration of the line with the principal repairing shops at Kadem-i-Sherif where the present Damascus station is. A large terminal station with offices is to be built in the principal square near the new Government Serai overlooking the Wadi Barada. The present Kadem station is to be retained and the line continued to the new terminus passing close to the Maidan and Beramke stations of the French line. On the site of the Old Serai in the principal square is now under construction a hotel to contain 150 rooms, a line stone building with every modern comfort to attract tourists. The workshops and repairing works are now partly completed just east of the present Kadem Station. The machinery has been ordered from Baume and Marpent, Haine St. Pierre, Belgium, but has not yet arrived. It will be worked by electric power supplied by the Tramway Company (Belgian Concession) which has its power station at Ain-el-Fije, above the town, supplying both the tramways and electric light of the town. These will be the principal construction and repairing works for the line. In addition, smaller repairing works are to be made at— Deraa, Maan, Tebuk, El Ula, Medina, Haifa. At Deraa and Maan they are complete, and at Haifa are approaching completion. At Tebuk they have only recently been commenced, and will not be completed for some time. Tebuk and El Ula have been selected by virtue of their good water supply. Centre of Administration and Depots .—Thus the centre of administration, with the chief repairing and construction works, will be at Damascus. The new terminal station, the hotel, and the repairing works, are all favours which Izzet Pasha, the Sultan’s Chamberlain, confers on his native town in his capacity as chief of the Commission in Constantinople. The Mushir (Field-Marshal), Kiazim Pasha, still acts as chief of the Construction Department, but all plans and the real work are left in the hands of Meisner Pasha, the Chief Engineer, who has gained the complete confidence of the Commission at Constantinople. The construction offices are now at Maan, where Meisner Pasha has built a house, and where he has M. Schroder, a Frenchman, for his principal assistant. To Meisner Pasha all the credit of the construction of this very difficult project certainly belongs, and he has served the Turks well. The permanent way is well laid, and the bridges are solidly constructed. The Traffic Department of the sections already open is in a far less satisfactory condition, and great confusion results from want of proper direction and system. The chief offices are in Haifa, and the Mushir, Riza Pasha, an unsuccessful Commander in the Yemen, is the nominal manager. With him is Rear-Admiral Khalil Pasha, who superintends the disembarkation of stores at Haifa Pier. General Jew ad Pasha and fifty military officers of various ranks assist in the administration at Haifa, and have little knowledge or experience of railway management. Rolling-stock. Engines .—The existence of heavy gradients in the Yarmuk Valley and south of Amman has necessitated the purchase of high-power duplex engines to deal with the accumulation of traffic at these points. Eight have been ordered from Henschel and Sohn, of Cassel, and of these six have arrived, and are in use on the Yarmuk Valley section. They weigh nearly 60 tons, and are consequently rather too heavy for the light rails laid down. Several derailments have taken place recently, owing to this cause. [i.’556 dd—T] CThe rails vary from 38 to 42 and 52 lb. per yard ; the latter being found on the Haifa branch. * a There are in addition :— 9 large Krauss engines with tender each of 40 tons. 12 small Krauss of 30 tons. i n- -r u u 4 “B” Hohenzollern engines of small capacity, for use on the Haifa branch. This represents a total of thirty-three engines, many of which are under temporal There are twelve others, but they are useless, being out of repair or used for shunting only, and cannot be counted on for the general traffic. Fifteen more of the goods type have been ordered, which will increase the total to sixty. Other rolling-stock comprises :— 5 sleeping saloons used by high officials travelling, or by tourists. 2 1st class carriages, chiefly used in the tourist season on the Haifa branch, or when specially required. 19 3rd class carriages. 100 covered waggons. 145 open platform waggons. 6 special waggons for sheep. The Krauss engines are made by two German firms—Saechs Maschinen Fabrik, of Richard Hartmann, Chemnitz, 190G ; or Am. Jung, Jungenthal bei Kirchen, Rheinland, 1906. Carriages and waggons are by Belgian firms, which also obtain several important machinery contracts. The two principal firms are the Societe Anonyme Beige, Lion Hiard, Directeur; and the Usines et Fonderies de Baume et Marpent, Usine de Morlanweiss, Haine St. Pierre, Belgique, the latter now obtaining most of the contracts. Rails have been supplied by several different firms, the last contract being given to a French-Belgian firm in Russia, its rails being marked “ Providence-Russe, 1906. The iron is said to be of a very soft quality and to bend easily. Cockerill, a large Belgian firm, has executed another contract, the American Steel Trust another (the rails being marked “ Maryland, VU-IIIIIII ”), and a German firm at Donawitz another contract. The covered waggon is the most useful vehicle for the conveyance of troops, as it gives some shelter from the summer sun and cold winds in winter, while the peasants are accustomed to lying on the floor. The interior floor space is 27 ft. by 6 ft. 10 in., entered by double sliding doors at each side, 4 feet wide each leaf, or an 8-feet opening. The sides of the open platform waggon are made to let down, and these are also much used for transport of troops, pilgrims, and workmen, but they afford no shelter. The interior floor space measures 31 ft. by 7 ft. 10 in.; forty to forty-five men are usually crowded on to these waggons in troop trains. Six to eight of the small Syrian ponies can be carried in one covered waggon. All these waggons are of a capacity of 15,000 kilog., or 15 tons. The tare weight of a covered waggon is 8,500 kilog., or 8^ tons. The length of military trains would be entirely regulated by the Aveight the engine could haul up the steep gradients of the Yarmuk Valley and of Amman. With the usual type of engine six trucks, each loaded with 10 tons of goods, can be hauled up. With 40 men in each truck this would be 240 for each track, or 60 tons of goods. This specially applies to the long Yarmuk Valley incline ; that at Amman is worked by taking the train up in two sections of five carriages each. The new duplex engines can take double these weights, but then the engines have been found too heavy for the rails. Brakes. Hand brakes are in use on all these carriages, but Hardy’s system of automatic brakes is gradually being introduced, and some engines and carriages on the Haifa branch are already fitted. Couplings. A more secure method of coupling is now being introduced to replace the single buffer and hook, which was found very liable to break. Two screw couplings and two chains are now used and found to answer well.^ Signalling. The signalling is very simple, and consists in the driver of a train obtaining a “ line clear ” paper or message from the stationmaster, which takes him on to the next stopping-place. Green and white lamps are nsed at night at the points, hut there are hio other signals. Neglect of Rolling-stock. The rolling-stock is also in a had way through neglect. The third-class carriages, the only passenger vehicles on the main line, have scarcely a pane of glass in the windows, and the rain pours through the roof in had weather. For my journey a friendly engineer went round and unscrewed any whole windows he could find in other carriages, and hy this means a sheltered corner at one end of the carriage was obtained. A heated axle is not uncommon, and one unfortunate waggon on which 25 tons of wooden beams had been piled, regardless of the fact that its maximum load was 15 tons, collapsed, and had to be left behind at a wayside station. The pilgrims, wdio are not carried gratis except in a few cases, complain bitterly of the windowless carriages and open platform waggons on which they are forced to travel. There is still a large number who continue the old method of travelling the whole way by road, and there are others also who leave the Hejaz line at Deraa, cioss over to Mezerib, and continue their way to Damascus by the French line. The mosque carriage, specially constructed in Constantinople Arsenal, was resting in a siding at Deraa. The woodwork had not been properly seasoned, and was warped and split, the curtains were torn, the floor dirty, and the whole had an air of neglect while, owing to the carriage having been made too wide for the gauge, I was told that when in motion excessive rolling set in, and serious devotional exercises became impossible. There are some saloon sleeping carriages available for high ofhciafs travelling, or for tourists who will pay the very high charges demanded. A European traffic manager who had sufficient tact to deal with hiza I asha and the Turkish officials would alter all this and largely increase the revenue of the hue, otherwise it is difficult to see how^ the line can continue working under its present system with any chance of success in paying its way. If an Englishman could be appointed to replace M. Gaudm, it would bo an excellent means of introducing an English element into the working of the line. Supply of Water to Stations. The supply of water to stations and working parties is carried out in galvanized iron barrels of a specially strong design, electrically welded at each end, and holding 75 litres (16h gallons) and closed by a metal screw plug , , . Two of these constitute the load for a camel which are used to supply working parties away from railhead. , . , They are also carried by trains for giving out the daily supply to stations which have none Their strong construction and the fact of being electrically welded wit i no ioints for leakage make them very suitable for standing the rough usage on these services, and without them the supply of water, as Meisner 1 asha informed me, would probably break down. Windmill Pumps. Windmill pumps are found most useful and are erected where there are wells. Steady winds, sometimes creating violent dust storms, are usual m the desert, especia y at Maan and Tebuk. A steam pump is kept in reserve for each windmill pump ut is rareiy 1186^ ^ ^ reallybeen trie d, as the contract with a Belgian firm fell through. An attempt was made near Zerka in rocky sod which spoilt the boring machine, and only the depth of 30 metres was reached. The hollow basin east^ of Tebuk would seem a favourable site and there are others near Maan 1 he genera geological formation is limestone and sandstone with occasional lava beds or ’ harm.I This is an important feature as all coal is now imported for the line from Cardiff, only a small quantity being obtained from the Turkish mines of Heraklia on the Black Sea. The latter is found too smoky and liable to choke the tubes and is used mixecW with Cardiff in small quantities. ^ The reserves of coal at Haifa are ridiculously small, and through the improvidence of the administration it has actually happened that the Haifa-Damascus branch stopped working for forty-eight hours owing to the non-arrival of a steamer at Haifa. Only by borrowing from the French Company and from a British steamer in the harbour could traffic be resumed. M. Gaudin is now urging the administration to keep a reserve of at least 6,000 tons. The annual consumption for the line is from 20,000 to 25,000 tons per annum. A steamer unloading at Haifa Pier can discharge 300 tons of coal a-day in fine weather, which can only be trusted to occur in the summer months. ' • •' ' -■ Coal Supply. Defensive Station Buildings. The station buildings south of Tebuk are built on a special plan, with loopholes to enable the ten men usually found at a station to stand a siege from Arab raiders. The usual building is of stone, 11 metres by 12 metres, containiug four rooms, others are slightly larger and contain six rooms. The only entrance is by an iron door leading into a small courtyard on which the windows of the living room open. In the floor of this is a masonry cistern, or well, if such supply is obtainable. Provisions for fourteen days are stored in one of the rooms. The walls are loopholed at a height of 8 feet above the ground. The building is 5 metres high, and near the roof are some small windows 50 c.m. square. The flat roof can be ascended from the courtyard by iron battens let into the wall. The wall at the top is only 50 c.m. high and is without loopholes, so that firing would be onlv from the loopholes below. There is a verandah in front of the door, which seems a weak point. The latrine is in a loopholed projecting part, and is on the dry earth system. Receipts. The receipts last year amounted as far as could be ascertained, to nearly £ T. 100,000, and it is said that the traffic receipts on the paying sections up to Amman just balance the working expenses of the whole as far as Maan, the southern extension to Tebuk not included, this remaining entirely under military control. Revenue. The present revenue produced by the Hejaz stamp tax and other sources amoimted, according to Meisner Pasha’s estimate, to £ T. 350,000, or 8,750,000 fr. per annum! and this amount he counted on as available for construction purposes. Cost of Construction.—The Section in the Yarmuk Valley. The cost per kilometre of the present Arabian sections has been kept at £ T. 1.400. including the purchase of rolling-stock, and it was proposed not to continue building bridges over the dry wadis of Arabia but trust to the chance of the line being washed away at long intervals by rain floods, so that now he thought the construction expenses might be kept a little below this figure. Meisner Pasha estimated that £ T. 3,000,000 had been spent on the construction of the whole line up to the present. I tSince the construction of the line, the fertile districts ronnd Amman and along the Wadi Zerka have been brought under cultivation by Circassian colonists who have settled in several thriving villages, and are fully able to hold their own against the Bedouin tribes, their natural enemies. The European tourist traffic on the Haifa line from Nazareth and libenas to Damascus is quite an important item in the revenue. The paying parts of the line are therefore the main line from Damascus to Amman and the Haifa branch generally ; the sections from Amman to Maan and southwards into Arabia traverse a desert country, and produce practically nothing. The country south of Maan comprising Arabia PetrEea has been seldom traversed by Europeans. For 38 miles south of Maan it is hare stony desert, slightly undulating and crossed by several shallow wadis, which only fill in the rains at uncertain intervals of two or three years. Some low shrubs and scattered acacia trees are to be found along them. The' rugged hills towards the Red Sea constitute the El Hisme district, where several small springs, scanty vegetation, and a few Arab settlements are to he found. In Roman times several small settlements existed there. To the east of the line the country is more arid, hut generally level. Akaha, or Akaha-i-Hejazie, to distinguish it from the other Akaha on the Red Sea, is a ruinous castle or “ tala” on the pilgrim route, with a cistern dependent on rain supply. Just south of this commences an important natural feature, formed by the long escarpment of Batn-el-Ghrul, which necessitates a winding descent for the line in the form of a loop for nearly 500 feet. This wall of sandstone crags extends in a wide arc to the north-west, and forms a similar obstruction across the Maan-Akaba route. To the east it extends for some 40 miles without any easy passage, except a narrow foot track. The pilgrim route finds a fairly easy descent alongside the railway. _ The black rocks, in twisted shapes and pinnacles, contrasted with the brilliant red, yellow, and dazzling white of the rock and drift sand, form a very striking picture. The aspect changes at the foot of the descent, as a wide, undulating plain of red sand and stones supervenes, and extends far to the south. Jrom its surface project many curious dark red or black pinnacles, which sometimes rise to flat-topped ridges. To the west is a black serrated ridge, swathed in drifts of sand for much of the way up its slopes, forming the watershed with the Red Sea. Some 40 miles to the east is a continuous scarp of red sandstone, which forms the edo-e of the plain in that direction. O - 1 - ['4556 dd —Ij i s I D10 At Mudevere, 72 miles from Maan, is readied tlie first permanent water, and this is only an inferior supply from a deep well. 20 miles farther south, after crossing the Haraat Ahmar, a ridge dotted witl^ many black pinnacles of rock, and covered with drifts of sand and stones, is Zat-el-Haj, consisting of an old stone castle, half-a-dozen palm trees, with a good spring and well at the station. Jebel Sherora, the “ pulpit of the Prophet,” is a curious landmark in the ridge^s to the east, rising in turreted form to a flat summit nearly 3,000 feet above the plain. ▼ Tebuk contains the first habitations since leaving Maan, sixty houses of negroid Arabs in an oasis of date palms, a few fruit gardens and fields of wheat, about half-a-mile square, all watered from a large spring. Good water is found at the station wells, and advantage is taken of this to form a large depot for continuing the work in the waterless country farther south. It is curious to note that all the wadis from Batn-el-Ghrul, on the north, to Medain-i-Salih, on the south, drain inwards to a large depression east of Tebuk, at the foot of Jebel Sherora, and in a season of exceptional rain a shallow lake is formed here, which, however, soon becomes dry. Possibly artesian wells might here be a success but the attempt has not yet been made. South of Tebuk is the Wadi Atsel or Wadi Akhdar, the dry bed of which the line crosses by a masonry bridge of twenty arches. Although rain only comes to fill the wadi every two or three years, the bridge was this year found necessary as a rainstorm caused 6 feet of water to pass under it. Farther south it is proposed not to build such bridges and thus save expense, the line being laid across the dry bed, the chance of rainstorms and washouts being taken. The limestone hills now close in, the country becomes more accidented and, before reaching Akhdar, the line traverses a tunnel of 180 metres and then a rocky gorge called the Boghaz-i-Akhdar, before it emerges into the narrow valley between steep rocky hills in which the stone castle of Akhdar is situated. There are no habitations, but an excellent well with a constant supply is found inside the castle. The line now follows a waterless valley of the Wadi Akhdar and its tributaries by Dizad to Muadhem, another stone castle on the pilgrim route with a scanty supply of rain water stored in cisterns. ' Muadhem is the nearest point on the line to Teima. Medain-i-Salih is a similar castle among some rock-cut ruins with a poor supply of water from a well. The country is now much more broken, and before Medain is reached, the line traverses a rugged passage called the Mabrek-en-Naga through limestone crags. I he lava-strewn plateau of Jebel Auered extends to the west and shuts off access to the ^ sea ; eastward, towards Teima and Hail, are sandy plains crossed by some rocky ridges. leima is a fertile oasis m these high open plains, an outlying Colony from Jebel Shammar of 250 houses surrounded by palm groves. The railway passes it some forty miles to the west, but the place is important as on the road to Hail. Some thirty-five miles south of Medain the line reaches the large oasis of El Ula, the first habitation since Tebuk possessing the first good supply of water since Akhdar’ neaily 150 miles to the northward. Here it is intended to make another lar^e depot on the line, the last before Medina. ° The country between Medain-i-Salih and Hedie, and thence to Medina is rather more hilly, and wateiless as before, but a trace has been found following some of the smaller wadis tributary to the Wadi Humd, which affords a fairly easy gradient. As the line advances south of El Ula, a hilly country is traversed by an open wadi, a tributary of the^ Wadi Humd, which affords a fairly easy trace for the line. The Wadi Humd is the first opening in the line of hills to the west, giving access to the Red Sea at Wej. This wadi drains all the country about Medina and Eheibar as well as the country round El Ula, and forms an easy passage towards the coast. Eheibar is another important oasis, somewhat less fertile than Teima Ivina- off tho line some 40 miles east of Hedie. ’ ^ &amp; It contains 4,000 inhabitants in a large extent of palm trees, with several o- 0 od springs, and is surrounded by lava formations and barren rocks, from it a well- frequented route lies to Hail, and gives the place much of its importance. From Medina to Yambo-el-Bahr, on the Red Sea, is an easy, well-frequented route along which it would probably pay to make a branch line from Medina to the coast ’t From Medina to Mecca the trace of the line is not yet determined, no surveys having been made. The direct route is said to be rather hilly and difficult, and, ^noreover, passes through the country of the hostile Beni Harb ; one proposal is to take the trace somewhat east of the direct line through Suveriye and Sefaine, and down the Wadi Limon to Mecca. This route is nearly waterless, but avoids the more hilly part of the country. ^ Another scheme is to take the line down to Rabigh, on the coast, and thence to Rlecca. Both are indicated on the Turkish map of the projected routes inclosed in Sir N. O’Conor’s despatch No. 252 of the 6th April, 190k (I.D. No. 1836.) Competition of French Lines with Hejaz Railway. Since the opening of the Damascus-Haifa line, the French Company has suffered, owing to trade being diverted towards Haifa, and plans are now being considered of improving the narrow gauge part of the line between Beirut and Damascus. It will be remembered that the broad gauge section exists only between Rayak and Aleppo, and the line between Rayak and Beirut over the Lebanon is narrow. This gives no outlet for the broad gauge to the sea-coast, and it is now proposed to construct a new line from Rayak to Beirut through the Lebanon by a tunnel, and then at a lower level down the valley of the Beirut River to the sea. This was the original project, but the inventors of the rack rail system managed to induce the Company to accept their project, with the result that it is now unable to compete with the traffic brought to it from the interior, and unless something is done, the improvements at Haifa or Tripoli will divert almost all the traffic to those places. The new broad-gauge line after leaving Rayak would run to Zahle, and then through a tunnel some 5 kilom. long in the main ridge of the Lebanon, into the head of one of the tributaries of the Beirut River or Nahr-el-Beirut. The valley of this stream could be followed at a comparatively easy gradient down to the sea at Beirut. At Beirut itself the present harbour is far too cramped, and it is proposed to extend it considerably in view of the increased traffic that will accrue if the above scheme is carried out. It is also proposed to carry the broad gauge through the Anti-Lebanon from Rayak to Damascus ; but this will be a comparatively easy project as the present gradients are not too steep. The rack rail over the Lebanon could remain and be utilized for the large summer traffic to various resorts on the Lebanon. In winter it is now closed for long periods by snow. Arab Tribes along the Railway. In the desert immediately south-east of Damascus are_ the Wuld Ali, the deadly enemies of the Druzes, with whom they have constant skirmishes. The District of El Leja, which the railway skirts between Mesmie and Deraa, is an old lava flow from one of the mountains of Jebel Druz and a mass of lava blocks 30 to 40 feet above the level of the plain. In its fastnesses all kinds of Arab and Druze outlaws find a hiding place, and the district is a most unsafe one for travellers. Attacks are not, however, made on the line, and there is a strong garrison at Mesmie. The Druzes of the Jebel Druz are quiescent at present, and their trade in corn and other produce comes principally to the stations of Ezra and Ghazale, near Deraa. They are well armed, and are said to possess 16,000 rifles, principally Martinis, with some Gras and Berdan. The people of the Hauran Plain are also warlike and of fine physique possessing many Martinis also. It was not uncommon when travelling through these to meet half-a-dozen men, well mounted, and all carrying Martinis. They live in villages and cultivate this fertile plain, which is the granary of Damascus and exports to Haifa also. The Hauran people are under Government control, but are always spoken of as turbulent, which means they do not submit leaclily to Government exactions. The centre of Government of the Hauran is vested in a Mutessarif who lives at Sheikh Miskin. There are thriving Circassian settlements at Amman and along the W adi Zarka, which hold their own easily against Bedouin raiders ; but, at the same time, they have small respect for the Government.1 t . The two great Arab tribes along the line between Deraa and Maan are the Bern Sakhr and the Adwan, the latter a large confederation of seven sub-tubes. They occasionally make attempts on the line when they are camped near it sue# as lifting a rail or placing large stones along it; but the bheikhs receive a subsidy from the Government to prevent raids, and the system seems to work fairly well here The Bedouin are generally hostile to the Government and the line, and the Sheikhs were often spoken of in terms of contempt for having accepted money from th|| Government wan ^ Peni Sakhr are usually at enmity. The former are generally found near Es Salt, and the latter farther north. The Sheikh of the Beni Sakhr is Reimi-ibn-Faiz, and of the Adwan, Sheikh Ah Diab, whose son is called Sheikh-i-Sultan The great desert tribes of Roalla and Anaize of the Eastern desert rarely approach the South of Tebuk the hostility of the Arabs greatly increases and becomes a serious factor to be dealt with. The powerful tribe of Beni Atie and its sub-sections roam about the country between Maen Tebuk and Medain-i-Salih, and have shown themse yes hostile by cutting off soldiers who stray from the working parties and by making attacks on the construction works, one of such attacks quite recently resu ted in a captain and four men being killed. . „ , ^ . A ,. ir , The Sherarat to the east of Tebuk are another section of the Beni Atie or allied to them. The Beni Atie are m touch to the east with the tubes of Jebei bhammai, the great confederation under Ibn Rashid Emir of Hail and would act with them. The Chief of the Beni Atie is Sheikh Harb-ibn-Atie, whose tents are usually near Teima. The Fekr or Fakir is an allied tribe of the Beni Atie, their Sheikhs being Mutlak and Shebab. The Laida are another sub-section under Sheikh Diab. Both the Fekr and the Laida claim to be branches of the Wuld Ah near Damascus. The Wuld Suleiman, under Sheikh Asker are also a sub-section of the Beni Atie. Between Medina and Mecca is the powerful tribe of Beni Harb, which opposes even the extension of the telegraph and naturally object strongly to the line. Their present Chief is Sheikh Hamud. .. _ . TT , The Jihaine and the Billi to the north-west of Medina are allied to the Beni Harb, and it is they who recently stopped the working parties near Medina. The Ibn-er-Fadi, under Sheikh Suleiman Pasha, are on the road between Medina and the coast, and have rendered assistance to the Government, their Sheikh being rewarded with the title of Pasha. Possibility of invading Central Arabia from the Railway. If the Turks hope to make some point on the line a base for a movement against Central Arabia, they must select Tebuk or Akhdar as the starting point for such an expedition, the question of water being a dominating factor. Muadhem, the nearest point to Hail, has a scarcely sufficient supply of water. To be successful the Turks must alter their present want of system and create a more perfect supply organization for their columns in the long desert marches, and establish lines of communication that cannot be raided by the very mobile forces of the enemy. The supply question is the great difficulty experienced in campaigning in Arabia, for when Arabs have been brought to face Turks in the open they have usually been beaten, but when they confine themselves to raiding communications and cutting supplies, they have forced the Turks to withdraw as may be instanced by the recent Yemen campaigns and the recent Turkish expedition into Kassimand Hail which failed owing to being literally starved out. Thus a movement inland from Tebuk or Muadhem towards Central Arabia is an operation far more difficult than would appear from simply working out distances on the map, and would require a most perfect system of organization, which up to the present the Turks do not seem to have been able to create. The great Chiefs, Ibn Saoud or Ibn Rashid by combining the various sub-tribes might get together 20,000 men each ; and of these some 4,000 would be cavalry who would act as scouts and the remainder be mounted two men on a camel, carrying with them a store of provisions, cartridges, and a skin of water. They can cover sixty or seventy miles a-day, and the Turks have no defensive posts against an advance of such a mobile force.13 Possibility of a Line from Maan to Akaba. The construction of a line from Maan to Akaba has for the present been abandoned and the project entirely dropped. There are three alternative routes that might be found for the construction of ^uch a line :— 1. The direct route from Maan to Akaba, by Guera, following the present track used by troops. Owing to the very sudden descent of some 3,000 feet before reaching Guera from Maan, this line would be far too costly to construct, and this route is not to be thought of. 2. A line from a point farther south, such as Mudevvere to Akaba. This might start from the Wadi Rutm Station, at the foot of the Batn-el-Ghrul descent, and follow a difficult but possible route westward to the Gulf of Akaba. Meisner Pasha mentioned this would have to pass for 40 kilom. along the eastern shore of the Gulf, and for this reason it was unlikely to be sanctioned by the Sultan. 3. A route from Maan, by the Wadi Musa and ruins of Petra, after which a fairly easy descending gradient could be found into the Wadi Araba, and so to Akaba. This is perhaps the least difficult of the three routes, and, if the line is made, it will probably go this w T ay. Besides being easier to construct, it would be sheltered from attack by sea. The route crosses an easy col on the way to Petra, and there are few difficulties of construction thus far, the descent to the Wadi Araba would probably be found the most difficult. Jeddah-Mecca Railway. This project presents no engineering difficulties, and would follow generally the line of the pilgrim route. It would be principally intended for the use of the Indian and other pilgrims arriving by sea. The plans have already been drawn, but it is not very clear whether the Grand Sherif of Mecca and local Arabs would welcome the innovation. A line from Yambo to Medina wmdd not be difficult either, and would probably be a paying line too. 2. Haifa Harbour Project. The construction of a port at Haifa has been found more costly than at first supposed. The present pier is roughly built for a distance of 350 yards into about 15 feet of water, and serves to land railway material and stores from lighters. It is formed of rough stone blocks quarried near by, and these are unable to stand the storms raised by the north-west winds which drive into the bay, so that already 30 yards at the end has been swept away, and the twisted iron rails testify to the force of the waves. It is necessary, therefore, to construct a breakwater to give shelter to the landing quays. This breakwater will jut out from the town front, as shown in the accom panying plan, the arm A B being 700 metres, after which it will curve round to C, the harbour entrance being on the north next the shore of the Bay of Acre. The arm B C will be built in instalments, so as not to commit the railway to too much expenditure at first. The quay A. D will be about 500 metres, with a depth of 18 feet alongside. The arms xk B, B C will have landing stages for larger vessels, with rails laid alongside, and have 28 to 34 feet of water alongside. A considerable portion (shaded on plan) will be filled in to provide room for warehouses and railway sidings, space for which could not otherwise be found. The plan is from a sketch Meisner Pasha drew for me. The cost, he said, would amount to 800,000/. at first, but the extension of the breakwater will be gradual. Other estimates gave the total cost as 1,100,000/. Meisner Pasha insisted that the port should be made and owned by the Hejas Railway, and not leased to a foreign Company. Such a Company, he remarked, would |_2556 dd —1] E14 at once engage in competition the Beirut Harbour, and a war of rates would be disadvantageous, so that it were better to keep it in Government hands. | ^ n .1 ~r'v i 1 1 - ^ U I ^ H Ir - /~\r\~r\ +ho r*r\T~\ qt r*!! oil The Amman-Salt branch which was to have developed extensive phosphate deposits near Salt has not been proceeded with, chiefly owing to examination having prove the phosphate not as rich as at first supposed. ^ , . . Meisner Pasha’s estimate was 1,000,000 cubic metres of rich deposit worth working and he said that last report confirmed his view. . . , There were other extensive deposits but not sufficiently rich m phosphate to pay for working and transport to the coast. ^ i i j • There seemed no idea of extending this branch to Jerusalem, as the deep depression of the Jordan would be crossed and this could only be done at great cost. This short branch of ten miles along the sandy shore of the Bay of Acre has been previously suggested, and Meisner Pasha has revived the scheme as likely to prov e a paying one. Plans have been made but its construction is not so easy as might appear, as two rivers have to be crossed, the Nahr-el-Mokatta (Kishon) and the Nahr Namein, both in channels of deep shifting sand which entail expensive pier foundations. This would leave the Haifa-Deraa branch at Pule in the Plain of Esdraelon and pass through a well populated and fertile district of Syria by the large town of Nablus to Jerusalem. It would follow the existing main artery of traffic and not be difficult to construct. It would have considerable military value as a means of linking up Jerusalem, the coast districts of Jaffa and Ghaza with Damascus and other parts of Syria, and afford a means of concentrating Turkish troops from Damascus towards Ghaza to threaten the Egyptian frontier. This is another branch generally parallel to the above, starting from Tel-esh- made with Jerusalem, or a continuation made to Ghaza if found desirable. This w r as only a project which had not yet taken definite shape, and probably the Pule-Jerusalem scheme would first be undertaken. Syrian lines with the Bagdad Railway, although there might be surface opposition, with a view to obtaining more favourable terms from the Government. By this means the Bagdad Company would profit by the high kilometric guarantees of the Syrian lines, especially those on the section from Hama to Aleppo, and recoup themselves to some extent for the heavy expenditure in crossing the Taurus and Amanus ranges. He said that, according to his view of recent negotiations, the section from the Gulf to Mosul would become British, and the remaining portion from the Taurus to Mosul would be made by a combination of Prench and German capital, and on this understanding the combination of the French Syrian lines with the Bagdad Railway had been decided on. in his own hands. 3. Branch Lines. (i.)— -Amman-Salt. (ii.)— Haifa-Acre Branch. (iii.)— Fule-Nablus-Jerusalem Branch. (iv.)— Tel-esh-Shemmam-Plain of Sharon-Jaffa. Shemmam in the plain of Esdraelon and passing over a low ridge east of Carmel, after which it could traverse the fertile Plain of Sharon to Jaffa where connection could be 4. The Bagdad Railway in relation to the Syrian Lines. Meisner Pasha said the combination had practically been decided of the French 'Meisner Pasha did not favour the construction of a port at Alexandretta, owing Jo the difnculty of traversing the hills which overlook the town on the east, and he »eemed to think that the port would he made at Kestabol, as referred to in the Bagdad Railway Concession. Kestabol, he said, has no real existence, even on the map, and is only a convenient expression to include the most favourable site in the vicinity, such as Ayas or imurtaluk, a few miles farther down. He was strongly in favour of making Tripoli the principal port in North Syria, as being the best harbour on the coast, well sheltered, with a sandy bottom, only requiring dredging to obtain the necessary depth. An easy route for a railway could be found following the present road from Tripoli to Homs, there would be no steep gradients, the northern end of the Lebanon range would be turned, and this gap between it and the Ansarie Mountains would give access to the fertile Plain of Homs, and afford an outlet to the coast for the broad gauge line Aleppo-Homs-Rayak. In this connection it would perhaps be well to quote Article XII of the Bagdad Railway Convention, in which specific mention is made of Tripoli:— “ Dans le cas on le Gouvernement Imperial deciderait 1’execution d’embranche- ments reliant le chemin de fer faisant 1’objet de la presente Convention a la mer, en un point situe entre Mersine et Tripolis de Syrie, il ne pourra accorder la Concession des dits embranchements qu'exclusivement an concessionnaire, sous reserve, toutefois, de sauvegarder les droits deja accordes a la Societe du Chemin de Fer Damas-Hamah et Prolongements. ’ ’ The idea of making a branch to Tripoli seems, therefore, to have been under consideration when the Bagdad Railway Concession was drawn up. The Tripoli-Homs line could be cheaply constructed. The total cost for the 95 Idiom, between the two places, Meisner Pasha estimated at 150,000b, not including the construction of a port at Tripoli or the dredging work there necessary. He maintained that Beirut as a port had gained an entirely fictitious importance after the events of 1860, which led to the creation of the Lebanon province, and owing to this the claims of Tripoli as the principal port of Syria were overlooked ; but the place might now be restored to its proper importance. At the same time it is difficult to agree with Meisner Pasha’s condemnation of Alexandretta as a Mediterranean port for the Bagdad Railway, as it is naturally the port of Aleppo and of the rich districts near, while Tripoli lies rather too far south as an outlet for these places. The difficulties of traversing the hills east of Alexandretta are not very formidable, and when the project was proposed by an English Company, surveys proved it was quite feasible. It must also be remembered that the Bagdad Railway itself will have to traverse the same range higher up near Kazanali, and will encounter similar difficulties but only at a different point. 5. Proposed Connection between Egypt and the Euphrates Valley at Nejef. In view of the experience gained by the working of the Hejaz Railway, I would venture to put forward a proposal for a line connecting Egypt and the Euphrates Valley at Nejef, where it would join the proposed Bagdad line. This would connect up the two countries of Egypt and Mesopotamia, one already rich, and the other with a soil as fertile awaiting development. It would follow the ancient route between Egypt and Assyria, on which the rock city of Petra, near Maan, the old capital of Edom, was a station. From Cairo the line would pass near Suez and across the Sinai Peninsula to the head of the Gulf of Akaba. Thence the ascent would be made to Maan through Petra, water being found on the way and at the latter place, where there is a good supply. From there the line could be taken across to the Wadi Sirhan over gently undulating stony desert, with no hill ranges to hinder construction. It is true that this section is nearly waterless, but there are good wells at Hudruj, and at other points wells could be dug and water found. When the Wadi Sirhan is reached, several wells and a fair water supply is assured. Jauf is an important oasis on the northern edge of the Great Nefud Desert whic is thus avoided. The oasis contains 50,000 inhabitants, Skaka and Kara being other important places in it.16 fm »»(•.- ^^ss^sssrst ££RS?aitrsL Ll^rWadisSnwT there be' difficulty about water, and it is possible to +&gt;. A C W pllq inpre The line would have to depend almost entirely on through tamia to Egypt, avoiding a long sea passage and incidentally from India to. t e Mediterranean. ,, Distances on the proposed line would he as iollows Cairo to Maan through Akaba and Petra, 305 miles or 49^ kilom. Maan to Jauf 260 miles or 420 kilom Jauf to Nejef 31° miles or 500 tmim making a total distance from Cairo to Nejef of 875 miles or 1,412 kilom., little mo , than the distance from Damascus to Medina, which is l,o00 kiiora. This line could be begun at Akaba, Maan, Nejef, and Cairo simultaneously Assuming a general cost of 1,4001. per kilometre the total expenditure would work out to 3 000 000L, or 3,500,000/. with all expenses. , „ . The line would not so directly threaten Arab independence as the Hejaz line as i would pass north of the Nefud Desert and the districts of Jebel Shammar and Ha . As^regards the possibility of the line being used by the lurks to attack Egypt from the land side it may be noted that it would pass close to the sea at Akaba, whic place can always be reached by British cruisers, and that an occupation of that place would effectually check any movement towards Egypt. 6. Proposed Central Anatolian Line. In Damascus, where Izzet Pasha has many friends, it was said that a railway proiect in which he is now much interested is the construction of a line throng Anatolia from Angora through Sivas and Erzmgan to Erzeroum, Ais being constiucted bv the Turkish Government itself on the same lines as the Hejaz Railway. 3 Meisner Pasha mentioned that it had even been suggested that he should take over charge of the construction, and said he would be glad to get some change from the climate of Arabia. The object of such a line would be obviously strategical, and its construction would strengthen very greatly the defences of the north-eastern frontier of Turkey against a Russian attack from the side of the Caucasus. The construction of such a line would not be mcontravention of the Arran gem en with Russia regarding the construction of railways m the basin of the Black feea, a &amp; lines constructed by the Turkish Government itself are exempt from the agi cement. It would form a ready means of bringing the excellent fighting troops of Osmanh race from Asia Minor and enabling them to be mobilized rapidly across the Kars-Erzeroum Roa(i ‘ (Signed) F. R.

I HAVE the honour to report that, according to a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Damascus, the rails of the Hejaz line are now laid as far as the 755 th milometre from Damascus to a point a little beyond Akhdar, and the earthworks are nearly complete for 100 kilom. more. The Government are also beginning work at the Medina end, 1,320 kilom. from Damascus, and while the Haj was there in March the ceremonies of inauguration were held. Two battalions of troops have, Mr. Dever says, already begun the earthworks there, and the line from Akhdar via Medaini-Saleh to Medina has been studied. Mr. Loiso, the British Vice-Consul at Mersina, hears that the soldiers working near Medina have been attacked by Bedouins and obliged to withdraw, leaving the line to be destroyed, and that the authorities are trying to buy the Bedouins off.

[2503/-l] — The Hedjaz Kailway. —The Constantinople correspondent of the Indian Daily Telegraph reports an interview he has had with Izzet Pasha, whom ha describes as the Sultan’s right-hand man in supervising the construction of the railway for connecting the holy cities of Medina and Mecca with Turkey. Izzet Pasha stated that £T2,800,000 had been collected and another £'11,500,000 would be required to complete the 1,180 miles from Damascus to Mecca. The two sums work out a cost of about £3,600 sterling per mile of line. Izzet Pasha said that part of the country was very difficult, and at the present time food for the workmen and all materials had to be carried a distance of 580 miles. Five thousand soldiers were at work on the line, drawn from the 4th, 5th, and Gth Army Corps, and their employment substantially reduced the labour bill. The whole thing had been conducted honestly and above board, and no railway expert could accuse the committee of extrava gance. The work was being pushed forward in the hope that by August 30, 1008, the anniversary of his Majesty’s accession, a train might be steaming into Medina. Between that sacred spot and Mecca the country was mountainous, and there would be difficulty about water, but thoy hoped to cover the 2S0 miles between the two holy cities m less than two years. As they pushed further south the climate was against them, and they could not expect the same amount of work from men as in colder climes. During the year 5,000 pilgrims had been carried from Damascus to Tamboul, whence they proceeded by launch to Medina, the whole journey occupying only 12 instead of 35 days, and the railway ticket costing £5 2s. or about £d. per mile. In answer to a question, Izzet Pasha said there was at present no idea of prolonging tha railway to Jeddah to aid Indian pilgrims, or to Hodekiabi L as a strategic point to reliilorco the garrison of Yemen..

Mr. (x. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.-—(Received November 2(1.) (No. 758.) Constantinople, November 17, 1906. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith an interesting Memorandum prepared by Mr. G. A. Lloyd, Honorary Attache to this Embassy, on the progress of the Hedjaz Railway, and its influence on Arabian politics. While progress on the Bagdad Railway has been arrested owing to the difficulty in finding security for the loan necessary for the construction of the sections beyond Eregli, the Hedjaz Railway has been steadily advancing until the railhead is now at lebouk, some 190 kilom. south of Ma’an. Next year it, is expected to reach Meda’in Saleh, which, as Mr. Lloyd points out, is within about five post marches of Hail, and may serve as a military base, from which to conduct operations in Central Arabia, and the Nejd. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum bi/ Mr. Lloyd on some more recent aspects of the Hedjaz Railway, and its Importance and Influence on Arabian Politics. SOME rather remarkable ceremonies have recently been taking place on the Hedjaz Railway in connection with the completion of the line as far as Tebouk, a town situated some 190 kilom. from Ma an. . A good deal of space in the Turkish newspapers, and public attention generally,, has recently been devoted to these ceremonies, and to the progress of the line in general : and inasmuch as the difficulties that are being met with in the construction of this line as well as the immense future importance which the line must have in the near future are not easily or generally appreciated, 1 venture to draw attention to a few points of interest that are beginning to display themselves since the line has left Ma’an and entered into the little known province of the Hedjaz. The ultimate completion of the Hedjaz Xvailway depends upon -he successful solution of what may be called for the purpose of rapid review three problems (1) the constructional problem ; (2) the financial problem ; and (3) the political problem, by which latter term is implied the solution of difficulties that relate to the country and the people through which the railway must pass, and the opposition that ma\ be encountered from popular prejudice and the disturbance of local trade methods. 1. The Constructional Problem. The difficulties of construction of a railway through country which is for the most part absolutely sterile and destitute of water are very great. The question of water VoJ* » ; supply has so far been far the greatest difficulty. Up to Maan it had been overcome fairly well • a large reservoir that had been made and used by the pilgrims in the old days was found at Katraneh, which though shallow, and thus subject to great wastage of water from evaporation, proved to be a valuable supply and capable of improvement by being roofed in, &amp;c. From Katraneh to Ma’an water has had to be carried in trucks provided each with two large tanks, and though the cost of haulage of the water m this way has proved to be very costly, the finding of water at Maan at a reasonable [2223 re — 1 ] B2 depth, and the construction of wells there giving a large supply had fairly satisfactorily solved the water difficulty so far. ' ^ Since leaving Ma’an, however, the water problem has become increasingly difficult, no surface water being found, and generally speaking all attempts to sink wells has been a failure, water being only found at very great depths, and then in completely insufficient quantities. The discovery of water at Mudewere and Tebouk has assisted matters considerably though not relieving the necessity of a considerable intermediated transport of water. Added to the great difficulties which the scarcity of water has occasioned comes the question of fuel. The country being innocent of any kind of fuel, coal, oil, or wood, the transport of the same' over the long line of rail that separates Haiffa from the ever-advancing railhead, becomes a costly and difficult question necessitating an equally ever-increasing supply of rolling-stock and service, the organization of which on a single line of rail is in itself no mean task ; and the additional duty of providing food and other supplies sufficient for the 5,500 men that are engaged in the construction in varying zones results in great difficulties and hardships for*both the engineers and troops. The punctual daily arrival of the trains from .Ma’an to the railhead lias so far been fairly satisfactorily effected, but in many places the line of rail has had to be temporarily carried down into the beds of wadis,“until the stone bridges across them shall have been built, and so there is a risk that in the wet seasons the lines may be washed away and communication interrupted. The scarcity in the supply of masons has led to this course being adopted for the purpose of expedition, and the hope of beincr able to carry out the Sultan’s order that the line should reach Meda’in Saleh next year. he country south of Tebouk as far as Meda’in Saleh has been already surveyed by Moukhtar Bey, who reports favourably on the country, but holds out little hopes of finding water. There is some prospect of difficulty as regards the construction of the rm T r V ert f m dlstrict where ^ere appear to be sand drifts, but this is less a mfficulty of engineering than of avoiding increased expenditure per kilometre. n a i 1P c ff &lt;:a p s instruction are well given in a report published recently in German y Au er Bash a, a German officer in Turkish employ, which 1 have, therefore had a translation made of the most interesting portion, of which I inclose herewith a copy. e only other point that need be mentioned in reference to the Question of construction is that of labour supply. According to Auler Pasha there is no prospect an the Bedouin Arab will ever be got to work or to assist in the construction ot the line, but since the inauguration ceremonies, to which I shall refer later a considerable change has occurred in this respect The Shiekhs having become reconciled to the advent of the line, the Arabs appear to have realized a unique oppoitrinity of earning money and are now offering themselves in large numbers for employment, this new state of things will probably not reduce in any large decree e cost o. construction, but it has to a small extent solved the difficulties of food and suppies. ic number of troops employed on the construction will be able to be diminished, and the Arabs who are self-supporting will replace them. Tne Financial Problem. Perhaps one of the most striking features in the conception and realization of the tledjaz Kail way is the successful wav in which money has been raised by means as ingenious as they are yarious. Inclosed herewith will be found a translation from the the balance-sheet for 1905. In this balance-sheet is shown a surplus of oh ooe coi 1 ”- r s ’° r y e 7 approximately 230,000/. The total receipts shown are oVesfyeo F ,a f S ’ expenditure 224,713,347 piastres. Of the total receipts f ’ , 4,7 i' 3 piastres are derived from various revenues attributed to the line, 88,448 161 piastres from subscriptions, 30,899,801 piastres from subsidies allotted by Imperial order } it anque - gnco e, and 30,999,127 piastres are profits realized by conversion ot moneys c o 1Iected in the provinces. The traffic returns of completed sections, maudy that of the Haiffa branch, have yielded 6,190,336 piastres (almost entirely raffic of material for the building of the railway) and taxes on the districts covered y e railroad, 1,467,505 piastres. The total expenditure is given as £ T. 2 211 080, * l nno°\ hHt ;* Un ? lfc 18 Sai( J that £ T * 200 must be deducted as the Value of . tons of sleepers, and 11,000 tons of rails not yet used, and £ T. 79 436 placed to expense account, but which should be properly placed to the cost of running expenses. ^ u is pmfe impossible to check or to estimate the value of the figures given hut in all probability it would be unwise to place too much reliance on the details. But theirmain interest and importance is that they broadly show the immense sums of money that are both being raised and expended on the line. In addition to continual demand for “ subscriptions ” as a religious duty, money is raised in a large number of various ways, of which it is very difficult to get a complete list. 1 may, however, cite a few examples which may safely on the same lines be amplified tenfold in imagination :— 1. All Concessions and copies of them, poussolas and petitions, must be stamped with the Hedjaz Railway stamp. 2. All forms of leases, “ permis de construction,” “ permis de reparation,” for houses and property of all kinds are subject to a special Hedjaz Railway duty and applications for and copies of same must also be stamped with the Hedjaz Railway stamp. 3. The receipt of all Government salaries and wages must also be so stamped. 4. By arrangement with the Shirket Company of steamers up the Bosphorus, all ' fares from Stamboul are increased and the increase given to the Hedjaz Railway. 5. The profit derived from the sale of skins of sheep sacrificed for the Kourban Bairam throughout,the Empire are also devoted to Hedjaz Railway. There are countless other ways in which the imposition of the Hedjaz Railway stamp is used to extract money from all classes and creeds under Moslem rule in Turkey, but although it is a very serious burden on the people, yet whether it be from a feeling of the religious importance of the work, or the usual patient obedience ro authority, there seems no prospect of any refusal from the people or any cessation of payment. Between the time the line was commenced and September 1905 46*7 million francs were raised, and there seems no doubt that as long as this Sultan lives at any rate the railway will not be allowed to want for funds. Doubts have been expressed as to whether funds sufficient for the maintenance of the line will be found, once the interest which the construction of the line has aroused has died down. Auler Pasha’s views on this subject and the estimates that he gives seem somewhat unduly optimistic, a fact that is scarcely surprising when it is understood that his facts and information emanated almost entirely from Izzet Pasha, the Sultan’s Secretary ' and organiser of the whole work, and may therefore be expected not to err on the .side of depreciation, but his statements as to the earning capacity of the line as far as Ma’an, and the probable future development of the Hauran and its mineral and agricultural wealth, are probably to be taken seriously, and it must be remembered that the upkeep per kilometre of a narrow gauge railwav with one train a week running at slow speeds is not great, and a very small proportion of the taxation now imposed, plus certain revenues already assigned to the line would be sufficient to maintain the line. Auler Pasha suggests that the pilgrims will travel free to Mecca, but it is probable that they will he called upon to pay in one way or another some portion of the cost of their transport. c The third problem in connection with the undertaking is the attitude of the Arabs- and people of Mecca and Medina towards the ingress of a railway to the Hedjaz, and , the consequent interference with their trade and camel traffic*, that has held a monopoly of the pilgrim traffic from time immemorial. When the line recently reached Tebouk, an inauguration ceremony of an imposing character was arranged to coincide with the birthday of the Sultan. A few days previous to this the most important Sheikhs and officials of Tebouk and Meda’in Saleh were gathered together at Tebouk, and special trains took them over the whole extent of the line as far as Damascus, where they were entertained by the Yali and other offioiaR specially sent there for the purpose. On their return to Tebouk they all took part in the inauguration ceremony (of which I inclose translation of official accounts), when the religious character of the undertaking was specially brought out and special pravers made for the Sultan. The object of these ceremonies aeems to have been attained, and the question of hostility from the Arabs becomes for the present practically negligible, though the question may come up again when the rail from Jeddah to Mecca is commenced. The question of building this branch is daily becoming more urgent; the difficulties of construction so far from a seaport, under special conditions, will have to be solved either by a branch from Mudewere to the Gulf of A kata or from Jeddah to Mecca The harbour at Haiffa needs a considerable further expenditure of money to make it practicable in bad weather, and even so it is too distant a base. The delay in building the much-needed Jeddah branch is due probably to the fear of interfering with ti e camel traffic there, which is in the hands of the Shereef of Mecca, who, if deprived of this profitable source of income, might be likely to use his influence more in opposition to than in aid of theHedjaz Kailway. The Sultan is also said to have an obstinate dislike to bringing the railway into touch with the sea, and thus putting it within reach of naval hostility. However this may be, the necessity for joining up the main line to the Ked Sea is so urgent that it seems fairly certain that before very long the line will be built, and the financial difficulties to which Auler Pasha alludes as the cause for delay need probably not be seriously considered, as the cost of building a line from Jeddah to Mecca would be very slight, whereas both traffic and receipts should be very considerable.^ If the branch line is constructed, it is estimated that the main line will be completed in about three years ; if not constructed, in about five years. It becomes, then, very important to realize clearly the fact that we shall be face to face not only with an entirely new situation in Arabia, but with an entirely new force, the measure of whose influence, though not easy to gauge, is very easy to under estimate ; but there can be no doubt whatever that the change will be one which will increase immensely the power and prestige of the Sultan in those parts of his dominions. I venture to submit that it is of the very greatest importance that we should realize clearly that this railway will have, even before its completion, an immense and far-reaching effect on the whole situation in the Nedj ; that it will also be liable to affect in no small degree our political position and influence on the western shores of the Persian Gulf. Further, it would seem to be of the most urgent importance that sufficient attention should be paid to the masterly methods and deeply-thought-out policv that is finding an expression in the ways above indicated ; but one fact stands out clearly from the vista of conjecture, and that is, that the le-establishment of effective Turkish control over the Nedj must come either from Bussorah and Bagdad or from Meda’in Saleh. From the Hauran south to Jauf there is no central point whence the operations that should be effective m Hail or Boreyda can be based. The Hedjaz Railway will reach Meda’m Saleh before the Bagdad Railway has succeeded in crossing the Taurus—perhaps before it has attempted it—and it is fair to conclude^that on the Hedjaz Railway we shall see before long a strong military base, from which Turkey may hope to recover in Central Arabia and the Nedj a large portion of the prestige that it may be her destiny to lose, or to maintain only in an impaired condition, in Southern Arabia and Yemen. When the Hedjaz Railway reaches Meda’in Saleh next year, it will be only distant from Hail some five post-marches, and an indication that the lurks realize the significance of this may be seen in the otherwise somewhat inexplicable decision which they took on the death of Ibn Raschid, namely, to continue giving their support to the shattered remnants of this fallen dynasty against that of the victorious Ibn.Saoud. If the ability or determination of Turkey to finish this great undertaking be ever doubted, it should be remembered that she has recently given us a striking example of the risks she is prepared to take to achieve her ideal. Pan-Islamism was not the cause of the Akaba dispute, but the weapon ; but it was with eyes fixed upon the Hedjaz Railway that she then made her attempt to gain terricory that was of great importance to the furtherance of that scheme. In that dispute she made a final attempt to gain territory on the west shore of the Gulf of Akaba, whither she might bring the Maan branch of the railway and avoid the difficulties that are presented in the steep descent to Kalaat-el-Akaba from the high table-land above. There she failed, but she was ready to risk a serious situation for the chance of gaining that end. It is not generally known that an Irade for the building of a railway from Syria to Mecca was actually issued twenty years ago, but various circumstances prevented its execution; but the determination to build the railway has never been lost sight of, and will not fail now in its execution. The amount of interest that is being taken by all classes of lurks m the progress of the railway is very remarkable, and among the more educated of them there is a strong but quiet conviction of the success, as well as a thorough realization and appreciation, of the additional political and military strength that this railway means for them. I venture to reiterate that it is of importance to realize both this feeling as well as the intentions that exist for the use of the railway. (Signed) G. A. LLOYD.Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Report by Auler Pasha respecting the Hedjaz Railway. ^ Part III. — History of the Construction. (Translation.) ON the 1st May, 1900, appeared the Imperial Trade for the building of the line,, and preparations were at once set on foot. As the railway was for a religious object, the money for building it was raised by voluntary contributions from the whole of the Mahommedan world. Besides this money, certain Government revenues—for instance, certain stamp duties, and the proceeds of the sale of the skins of sheep slaughtered at Bairam—were devoted to the Hedjaz Railway. Further revenues for the future are the proceeds of the phosphate beds near Es Salt, on the Hedjnz line, and the sulphur springs near Hamma, on the branch line Haifa-Der’a, the exploitation of which has been handed over to the Hedjaz Railway. Up to the 1st September, 1905, the total income amounted to 46-7 million francs—* about 7’5 million francs per annum. On this date, after the payment of all expenses, the railway still had the sum of 8‘25 million francs at its disposal. At the same time as the preparation of the money, the following preliminaries were arranged for :— 1. The organization of the building authorities and of the Directors. 2. The introduction of negotiations for the acquisition of territory. 3. A survey of the whole line for the purpose of making a general plan of building. 4. The procuring of instruments and railway material. 1. For the direction of the construction the following Commissions were formed : — (a.) The General Commission for the construction of the Hedjaz Railway, estab lished at Constantinople. The Grand Vizier is the President. Members : the influential and indefatigable Izzet Pasha ; the Minister of Public Works ; and the Director of the Factories of the Marine Arsenal. Besides these, some officials of the Ministry of Public Works have been appointed as technical advisers. The Commission is charged with the care of finding the moneys required, and decides upon the applica tion of the same. It carries on' diplomatic negotiations in acquiring land, appoints engineers and officials, and makes contracts for supplies. As it is only twenty-two years since Turkey has had an engineering school for civil engineers, and these, through the lack of Government railways, have hitherto had but little opportunity for practical work, there was at first a dearth of experienced engineers. The Commission has therefore for the present imported engineers from abroad, especially from Germany, and bound them by contract. By degrees, however, during the building of the railway, a number of pupils from the engineering schools have become efficient engineers, and are equal to all demands made upon them. At the present moment there are ten foreign and twenty-five Turkish engineers at work on the railway, not taking into account the officers of the engineers. (5.) The Local Commission for the construction of the Hedjaz Railway, with its seat in Damascus. The President is the Vali of Damascus; the members are the Director-General of the Hedjaz Railway, Kiasim Pasha ; the Commanding-General of the 5th Army Corps ; and a .Notable of Damascus. The technical members are Chief Engineer Meissner Pasha, Director of the Engineering Works of the Railway Construction, and several Turkish railway engineers. The Commission examines the plans and proposals of the Director-General and lays them before the Constantinople Commission for decision. It also arranges for payment of salaries and wages. At the head of the railway construction was placed the afore mentioned Field-Marshal Kiasim Pasha, who has hitherto distinguished himself not only by his talent for organization, but also by his caution and energy. In addition to the troops, the whole of the engineering staff, the contractors and labourers, are under his orders, and it is particularly to his credit that he has managed to avoid friction between the military and civil elements, so that both parties work heartily together to attain this end. C6 The technical management of the construction was intrusted to Chief Engineer Meissner Pasha, and the choice has proved especiall} 7- happy, as Meissner has collected much experience during his many years’ work on the railways of European Turkey, and to this experience adds an iron energy. The building of the bridges, &amp;c., was given mostly to Austrian and Italian con tractors, and the work was for the greater part carried out by natives, as foreign labour was difficult to get. ^ The further into the desert the railway advanced, the more difficult became the question of labour. On this account, and for reasons of economy, Turkish troops were largely employed in the work of construction. There are now workinof there —- Railway Battalion, No. 1, with &gt;( 0 . 2, with The Sappers Company, oth Army Corps Detachment of the Telegraph Company, oth Army Corps Two battalions infantry regiment, 33rd Army Corps Tnree ,, ., -‘t9 h „ Four ,, „ 39th „ Total 1,200 men since September 1, 1900 (till April 1. 1900, only on the survey). 1,200 since May 1900 (from spring 1904 til! September 1905 on the Haifa Railway). 200 men since May 1900. 50 ,, September 1, 1901 ; 1,000 „ „ 1 , „ 1.000 „ „ 1 , „ 1,000 „ „ 1 , „ 5,650 men. The infantry battalions did the earthwork, while the railway troops made the heddins:, laid the lines, and did some of the minor masonry work, such as building bridges and culverts. They also supplied the men for the preliminary surveying and surveying companies, (c. Construction, Part IX.) The sappers were chiefly employed in the railway workshops as mechanicians, lock smiths, smiths, and carpenters. The telegraph detachment laid down the railway telegraph for the Hedjaz and Haifa Railways, and were then placed at the stations as telegraph operators. 2. The most important negotiations which the General Commissions in Constanti nople had to carry on were those with the French Company, Beyrout-Damascus- Muserib ; and with an English Company on account of the line Haifa-Damascus, which has just been begun, and for which the Company had received the Concession. It was important that the Company should obtain possession of the line Damascus- Muserib, as they would have then begun the railway direct from Muserib and not Damascus, thus saving the laying down of 120 kilom. of rail for the Hedjaz line. But their efforts were not crowned with success, and the apparently liberal compensation of 7,000,000 fr. was not accepted Negotiations with the English Company were more satisfactory, which may be attributed to the facts that they were in money difficulties, and that the whole line consisted of the substructure from Haifa to Beisan and 8 kilom. of rail. The Commission bought the Concession from the English Company for 925,000 marks. With the exception of these two, no other negotiations were necessary for the acquisition of land. The Sultan, as absolute Sovereign, can dispose freely of all the land of his kingdom, and whatever is necessary for Government purposes is requisi tioned without permission of the owner. As the construction of the Hedjaz Railway is a religious work, every Mussulman gave up his property with joy in order to contribute to the success of the undertaking. 3. In order to make a provisional trace of the Hedjaz Railway a survey of the whole line was necessary. This was undertaken by the Turkish Engineer, Hajji Moukhtar Bey, soon after the Imperial Trade for the commencement ot the work had been given. To this end Moukhtar Bey joined a caravan of pilgrims going from Damascus to Mecca, and during the journey he made his observations and took measurements. The results of his survey he has given in a report (see Annex) and in the accompanying map with sectional profile. His sketch of the line has been corrected as far as Mudewwere (572 kilom.) after the completion of the railway up to this point at the end of 1905 made it possible to take exact measurements. The trace of the line Haifa-Musenb is also the result of exact measurements after its completion. 4. Owing to the lack of native factories, the Herljaz Railway was forced to get from abroad all necessary material (rails and rolling-stock) with the exception ot a few ofthe carriages which were made in the marine arsenal. Rails and sleepers have been supplied by German, Belgian, and American firms, rolling-stock by German and Belgian firms only. On account of the transport, the cost of material is, of course, much augmented, hut this disadvantage is partially rectified by the fact that, with the exception of hmer and cement, the material required for the construction of stone bridges and bedding are to be found of good quality on the spot, and may be taken from the quarries free of cost. The real work of the Hedjaz Railway began with the laying of the railway telegraph some years after the laying of a Government telegraph line from Damascus, via Es Salt and Ma’an to Medina. Shortly afterwards the construction of the Hedjaz Railway itself was commenced, on the section Muserib-Der’a, as the negotiations with respect to the line Damascus-Muserib had not yet been definitely concluded. The work progressed but slowly, so a provisional contract of three years was made with Chief Engineer Meissner in January 1901. Meissner Pasha’s first step was to find suitable assistants and to get the necessary tools, especially measuring instruments. He then began with the military and civil personnel at his disposal, the construction of the line between Muserib Der’a and Damascus Der’a, as in the meantime the negotiations between the General Commission and the French Company had come to naught, and the former had decided to build a line Damascus-Der’a, parallel to the French line Damascus-Muserib. When later on these negotiations were again resumed, unfortunately without result, the work between Damascus Der’a was again interrupted for a whole year, so that this part of the line could only be opened to traffic in September 1903. However, the work on the line Muserib-Der'a was continued without interruption, so that the following sections could be opened :— Muserib-Der’a (12-8 kilom.) on the 1st September, 1901. Der’a Serka (79-75 kilom.} on the 1st September, 1902. Serka Katrame (123*45 kilom.) on the 1st September, 1903. Katrme Ma’an (132*60 kilom.) on the 1st September, 1904. On this day, the anniversary of the Sultan’s accession, took place the solemn inauguration of the whole line Damascus-Ma’an, by a special Imperial Mission under leadership of the Minister Tarkhan Pasha. , In connection with the year’s pilgrimage to Mecca, the opening of the section Ma’an Mudewwere (113*2 kilom.) has been planned. (Note. In the course of this summer, 1906, the section Mudewwere Sat-ul-Hadj has been completed, and it may be expected that at the end of this year the lines will be laid at the station Tebak.) It is easy to understand that the Hedjaz Railway wished to get an outlet to the sea as soon as possible, as the transport of the immense quantities of building material over the French line, Damascus-Beyrout, proved very expensive. Therefore the construe tion of the branch line Haifa Der’a was commenced from Haifa immediately on conclusion of the aforementioned negotiations with the English Company. The original English project by which the line was intended to run from Haifa straight through the valley of the Jordan to Damascus, was changed, so that the railway crossed the Jordan of the town of Beisan, then touching the Sea of Gennegaret near Lamach, took its way through the deep romantic valley of the Jai muk on to Muserib. Already on the 1st September, 1904, the section Haifa Jordan w-as opened to traffic. On the 1st September, 1905, the section Jordan Muserib was inaugurated and thereby was created for the first time a Turkish railway communication with the Mediter ranean. Through its natural position Haifa possesses all the conditions for a good harbour. But in consequence of the strong currents from the west, the sand is banked up and ships are forced to anchor outside the harbour. A jetty 350 metres long, has not yet improved matters. In order to make a usable harbour it would be necessary to build a breakwater 500 metres long, and a quay of about 600 metres.* Part IV .—Description of the Completed Section between Damascus and Mudewwere.

The Hedjaz Railway is a narrow-gauge railway of 1 05 metres breadth. This was made necessary, in the first place, by the small amount of money collected mostly from voluntary contributions. Secondly, the construction of a narrow-gauge line is, from an engineering point of view, considerably easier than a broad gauge, and, thirdly, came the circumstance that the line Beyrout—Damascus, which upon the building of the line Haifa-Der'a formed the only connection between the Hedjaz Railway and the sea, is also narrow gauge. Lastly, it did not seem likely that there would ever be any great traffic on the prospective railway. The iraufire of 1‘05 metres was chosen because it is the breadth of the line Beyrout-Damascus. The railway line, the sectional profile of which may be seen from the accompanying drawing (Table 2), follows in the main the old pilgrim and caravan road from Damascus to Medina. Between Damascus and Serka it keeps to the east of the road, then follows it again from Serka to Madewwere, deviating only occasionally to the east or west to avoid hills or unfavourable ground. The first important deviation from the straight pilgrim route was necessitated near Amman, where the rise from Serka to the plateau south of Amman, a rise of 340 metres, had to be effected. This has been done by a series of curves extending over a distance of 3 kilom., during which the steepest gradients are tuoi&gt;» with curves of 100 metres radius. On this part of the line several important pieces of masonry work had to be built, In particular, a viaduct of hewn stones, 20 metres high with 10 inches 12 metres wide, and a tunnel 140 metres in length, the only one on the whole of the main line. Between Ma’an and Batu-ul-Ghul there is a similar change of level on the line r but the difference in height is only 150 metres, and so could be overcome by a gradient of jootT an&lt; ^ curves in 100 in radius over a distance of 8 kilom.Besides these two points, the railway had to cross only a few valleys (wadis) with low banks, and so a gradient of was found sufficient on the straight. In the curves the gradient was even less. Near Batu-ul-Ghul the straight route of the pilgrims road had to be deviated from on account of the clay bed, which it was feared would cause a shifting of the embankment. Near Mudewwere a layer of drift-sand 2 metres deep had to he avoided. The bedding consists of a firm mixture of lava, basalt, and flint rubble. On the foundation, as far as Serka, are laid wooden, and from there on, iron sleepers, to which the rails are attached. The stone material for the bedding was found in plenty along the greater part of the route and of the necessary size, so that it seldom had to be broken up. The wooden sleepers have proved unsuitable to the hot climate. The wood soon shrinks in the intense heat of the sun and then splits. In consequence, the nails holding the rails loosen and cease to hold the rails in their vertical position, so that a change in the gauge is unavoidable and the waggons oscillate when passing over the lines. After this experience only iron sleepers are now used. The weight of the rail per metre is 21‘5 kilog., that of the railway (rails, sleepers, and appurtenances) 103 kilog. The groundwork of the railway has necessitated a great amount of masonry. The most important works, the tunnel and the large viaduct near Amman, have been already mentioned. On the section Damascus-Mudewwere, including the viaduct, there are, altogether, 462 bridges, 271 aqueducts, and 799 culverts, making a total of 1,532 engineering works. Only one, 15 metres long, bridge is of iron, all the other works were carried out in stone. The culverts are either arches, or covered with rails and beton. The strength of the masonry in the construction of these works has been measured with a liberal margin, to allow for the poorer quality of workmen employed, and the pernicious efiects of great heat and dryness on the mortar. 1 he lime and sandstone, which were found over almost the whole route, provided excellent building material. The heavy bridges are made with one or more arches, of breadths varying from 3 to 12 metres ; the opening of the culverts are from 0‘40 to 2 metres, according to the rainfall expected during the rainy season. In what surprising quantities the rain can appear in usually dry wadis, the Director of the Bailway Construction was to learn in the winter of 1904-1905. Certainly there had been a rainfall on the east Jordan highlands, especially beyond Amman, such as had not been known within the memory of man. A wadi to the south of the station of Kassr, in which there was^ no perceptible watercourse, had been crossed by the railway by means of a dyke, which, taking into consideration the expected rainfall, was provided with the following openings:— 1 bridge of 4 arches each, 3 metres broad. 1 j, b 5&gt; 1 55 ^ ,, ,, 1 „ 3 The openings were insufficient, in consequence, the water found no proper outlet, and tore down the bridges together with 20 metres of the dyke. Shortly afterwards, in pouring rain, a tram going’ at 20 kilom. an hour drove straight towards the breach. The driver only discovered the danger when he was within 5 metres of the hole. It was too late to stop the engine and tender, followed by five open and closed waggons, dashed into the opening and only the five passenger waggons remained upon the dyke. Wonderful to relate in this accident, not one man was killed and no one was ever seriously hurt. The damage to the stock was also slight, and the Kraus locomotive had scarcely suffered at all. Except for the break in the dyke, the heavy rains of the winter 1904-1905 did no damage on the main line, and one may say that it stood the first trial well.12 Part Y. —Description of the Branch Line Haifa—Der’a.

A stream of water 4 metres deep rushed through the valley, tore down all the temporary bridges, and even carried off a petroleum motor and three pumps, and caused such damage to the buildings in course of construction as to throw the work back at least four weeks. The branch line is built like the main line, with the exception that none but iron sleepers have been used. Excellent stone and sand for the masonry and bedding were found everywhere, but all the material, especiallv for the iron bridges, had to be imported from abroad. Platforms for the unloading of gun-carriages. &amp;c., are not to be found at any of the stations either on the main or branch line. The unloading is carried out by means of improvised gangways. * (■'/ r 1 Part A I .—\fanagement and Equipment of the Rantray for Traffic. By the equipment of the railway are to be understood all the furrushings of the stations, as well ns all arrangements necessary for the repairing and supervision of the line and rolling-stock. As the Hedjaz Railway is the first railway built and run by lurks there was a great dearth of experienced and energetic officials amongst them : so that the General Commission in Constantinople, even more than in the case of the building, had to fall back on outside help. In consequence, almost all the higher positions in the management of the traffic, workshops, &amp;c.. are filled bv foreigners, Germans, French, and Austrians, belonging to foreign Companies. The fact that no monev or trouble was spared to obtain only first-class men, is a proof of the sincerity and intelligence with which the whole enterprise of the Hedjaz Railway has been conducted. The subordinate officials for the traffic, the station-masters, drivers, guards, stokers, and workmen on the line are mostlv natives. At first there was much difficulty these s?c] latter the necessary care in the handling of the machinerv, care which is especially called for on the Hedjaz Railway. The continual wind on the highlands soon causes the machinery to be clogged with dust and sand, thus necessitating more frequent cleaning than in other districts. Of late, however, there has been a distinct improvement in the natives’ ideas of the treatment of rolling-stock. As all the material for the Hedjaz Railway, rails, sleepers, rolling-stock, Ac., arrives at Haifa, and is there loaded forks destination, this town has been chosen for the present as the seat of the goods manager. Since the opening of the branch line Der a—Haifa, the exports from the interior are also sent to the port of Haifa. Later, on completion of the Hedjaz Railway, the goods office will probably be moved to Damascus, the capital of Syria, where the authorities of the vilayet live, as there is difficulty in communicating with them from Haifa. The intercourse with the administration of the Beyrout— Damn sens-Aleppo line, and with Damascus commercial firms will also be considerably facilitated The assistant goods manager is stationed at Der’a, the junction of the two railways. The works manager is stationed at Damascus, as the largest workshop for the repair of engines and waggons is to be found there. Der a is appointed as the permanent abode of the traffic manager, and of the administrator of the section. The principal stations of the Hediaz Railway are Damascus, Der'a, Amman, Katrane, and Ma’an ; those of the branch line: Haifa, Beisan, and Samach. -As a rule they are provided with a large station building, engine-shed, turn-bridge, water- tank hydraulic crane, and a coal depot, and in addition to the chief line, the necessary sidings for the shunting of engines and waggons. There are workshops at Damascus, Der’a, Ma’an, and Haifa, and others are in course of construct*! n. At Der'a there is a moderate sized dwelling-house for the accommodation of officials. At all the other stations there is only a rail way-house to accommodate six workmen, and an overseer who also acts in the capacity of staticn- master. At intervals of 30-70 kilom. there are water stations. Only from Amman the water. which For this purpose are used eithersteam pumps or wind pumps the working of which is rarely interrupted on account ol the continual wind on the highlands which are almost devoid of trees. A peculiar feature of the railway is the lodging houses for passengers. They are intended to enable passengers to remain overnight at a station, as hotels are totally unknown in these regions. All the station buildings are solidly built of hewn stone, mostly one storeyed. In and outside they are exceedingly simple. The roofs are tiled. The stations are also provided with the necessary arrangements for a night service. So long as the troops are at work at the various spots, repairing the line, a regular service of inspection will not be provided, and indeed it is not so necessary as in civilized lands. Railway crossings, cabins, and barriers are unknown here, and the few Bedouin caravans that wished to cross the line would do so where they pleased, without paying any attention to the official crossings. The cavalry detachments at the various stations patrol the line from time to time and thus serve as guards. Two companies of infantry mounted on camels, are appointed to guard the telegraph lines in the desert from Ma an to Medina and to Acaba. They patrol the line occasionally and examine the telegraph wires, and a few soldiers of the telegraph detachment, who are attached to the Company, carry out the necessary repairs on the way. The great difficulty of the task of these two Companies may be realized if one remembers that Maim and Medina are /GO kilom. apart, ano that theie aie veiy few intermediate stations on the whole telegraph line to facilitate the work of inspection. As long as the line is being constructed, and great numbers of people at the head of the railway have to be supplied with provisions, the traveller will always be able to find some food, but when the railway is finished and the workmen have been withdrawn, the Directors will be forced to run restaurant cars—of the simplest . description—on their trains, as it will, as a rule, be impossible to make provision for travellers at the stations in the desert. Part YII.— Rolling-stock. [Omitted.] Part VIII.— Special difficulties, and how they were overcome. 1. Water. The greatest drawback of the Hedjaz Railway is the scarcity of water. Some of the stations are provided with wells, others with cisterns In these walled cisterns, some of which date back to Roman times, water “ lVf mssinf the rainy season, to serve in summer as drinking and cooking watei foi pass g Bedouins with their herds. They hold a considerable quantity of water-the cistern in Katrane for instance can hold 36,000 cubic metres and that of Djise 70,000 cubic metres—but they are uncovered, have a large surface and are of no great depth. Consequently, the water soon evaporates from the heat of the sun, am foi months the cisterns are empty. But even at these stations where there are wells there is scarcity of water, as the continuous heat makes it dry up On the part of the railway which is completed sufficient water is only to found with certainty in the wells at Damascus, Der'a Serka Amman El Hassa, Maan and aiudewwere. store of water is not sufficient to guarantee the regular working of the lailway Yet the further into the desert towards Medina the railway penetrates, the gieater will '“t^lrarattempt has been made to get over the difficuliy by procuring locomotives with tenders of large capacity (8 to 12 cubic metres) and recently by ordering special cistern waggons for the transport of water. But the expedient fs very costly so that it has been decided to dig wells or make krge covered cisterns of suffilent depth at intervals ot 50 to 60 kilom. A necessary condition of the first proposal is, of course, the presence of springs, as foi instance at Mesm j .16 Cisterns Avill only be made in cases where it is impossible to dig wells. By making cisterns of a depth of 6 to 7 metres and covering them, the watei r v\ onld not only be . j better guarded against evaporation, but would also be protected against the harmful bacteria in the air. This water could then serve as drinking water. Further, an effort will be made to improve the quality of drinking water by the use of filtering apparatus. ... , Lastly, an attempt was made to bore Artesian wells, m order to get more and better water. These borings were carried out by experts, but, although they were made to a depth of 110 metres in some places, no water was found, which maybe ascribed to the fact that the plateau across which the railway runs is 80 to 100 metres above the bed of the Jordan, which drains this country. In consequence of the porous nature of the ground, the rainwater trickles through immediately, and is only carried down to the Jordan from a very low strata. It is possible that from the Medina Salih, where the ground begins to fall towards Medina, renewed borings might meet with a better result. The water question becomes especially acute o,t the head of the railway. There, where larger quantities of water are needed daily for mixing the mortar for the building, as well as for drinking and cooking for thousands of workmen, it is impossible to transport it by camel. As the zone of construction then lay between Mudewwere (572 kilom.) and Sat-ul-Hadj (611 kilom.) and the nearest plentiful wells were in the Ma’an (458 kilom.) the camel transports would have had to cover a distance of 114 to 153 kilom., about three days’ march to reach their destination; and what an enormous number of camels would have been necessary to supply all the vatei needed in the zone of construction. As may be seen, the providing of water for the zone of construction must be done by the railway itself. For this purpose several waggons, each of which carries two tanks containing 8 cubic metres of water (see Part Yll) leave Ma’an daily. The only difficulty in regard to this method of transport, is that, for reasons already mentioned, the building of the bridges over the numerous wadis is very behindhand, while the rails between them are already laid. This difficulty is Surmounted by avoiding the bridges by means of a provisional curved line, which descends to the bottom of the valley, crosses it, then rises again in the old direction so as to regain the railway beyond the wadi. In this way it is possible to transport the water by rail at no great cost, and to bring it to the foremost bodies of workers. The danger of the provisional lines at the bottom of the valley being washed away by rains is but slight on account of the very rare rainfalls in these districts. On the branch line Haifa-Der’a the water conditions are more favourable than on the main line At Haifa, Tellusch Schmam, Apule, Samach and Muserib there are wells rich in water, and even though in summer some of the tributaries of the Jordan, including the Jarmuk, are dried up, still water is to be found in the Jordan itself at all times. 2. Fuel. Both Syria and Arabia have few woods and coal-beds, and in the districts bordering on the Hedjaz Railway, and the branch line, Haifa-Der’a, there are none at all. It was therefore necessary to import coal from abroad as fuel for the locomotives and stations. The principal coal depdts for the Hedjaz Railway and its branch line are at Damascus and Haifa. From there all the coal needed for the railway as well as for workers on the line has to be sent to its various destinations—to Medina, for instance, a distance of about 1,400 kilom. This difficulty is, however, somewhat lessened by the fact that in those regions the temperature seldom falls below zero, even in winter, and that a minimum amount of such is required for the heating of station buildings, &amp;c. As a rule only fuel for the cooking and baking for the workmen on the line come into consideration. In consequence of the dearth of fuel the idea of making lime-kilns in the zone of construction had to be given up, although in many places on the line there are good chalk beds. The lime required for mortar is brought from abroad in the form of hydraulic lime, and from calculations made it has been proved that this is cheaper than the making and working of kilns in a country where there is almost no fuel. Material for lighting has also to be imported. The problem of heating and lighting, which, by the way, also concerns the railways in Turkev run by foreign Companies, still awaits ~ —-‘---r---*- rm ' satisfactory solution. hole The wworking of the railway becomes much more expensive through the importation of all the fuel from abroad. But the further towards Medina the railway advances the more- difficult becomes the solution of the question. The Trans-Caspian Railway, built by the Russian General Annenkow through the Kara-Kum Desert, would have had to contend with the same difficulties had there not been the great petroleum springs on both sides of the Caspian Sea. The naphtha Residuum obtained there not only provided excellent fuel for the locomotives, station buildings and kitchens, and for the camp ovens of the workmen, but was also success*- fully used in the lighting of the station buildings. The thought occurs that the large petroleum and naphtha springs near Mosul might be used in a similar way for the Hedjaz Railway. Certainly the first condition would be the continuation of the Bagdad Railway from its present end station Bulgurlu to the petroleum region near Mosul. As soon as this railway has been built and the short junction of this line with the line Damascus-Aleppo has been me.de it seems to be a matter of course that the stores of naphtha at Mosul should be employed as burning and lighting material on the Hedjaz Railway—assuming a rational exploitation of the naphtha springs. l 3. Drift Sands. Along the whole line of the Hedjaz Railway as far as Mudewwere there is m&gt; Rrift sand. The only bed of it, found near this place, has been circumvented by the railway. The ground lias rather the character of a chalk steppe than of a sand desert, and therefore forms an excellent foundation for the railway. According to Moukhtar Bey’s survey, however, there are several beds of drift sand beyond Mudewwere, which endanger the solidity of the railway, and might interrupt the traffic by drifting and choking the line. In the building of the Trans-Caspian Railway General Annenkow has shown us; that this evil may be overcome. He increased the firmness of the railway foundation at the spots where it was threatened by drift sand either by covering the sand bank with a layer of clay, or by introducing horizontal layers of wattles, or by planting sand plants, especially wild oats or tamarisk, the roots of which bind the sand together. At places where there was any special danger he protected the line from the sand bv putting up a balustrade, covered with shingles, against which the sand oioke and coUe there is an absolute dearth of trees and bushes both in the districts bordering on the Hediaz Railway and those further off, it will be at some spots impossible to combat the drift-sand by the same means as General Annenkow though similar methods will be resorted to. Quite near the station Batu-ul-Ghul (520 kilom.| there are extensive clay beds ; the neighbourhood is also rich in stones of all sizes. n mv opinion there is no doubt that it will be possible with this stone and clay to make the sand banks in this region sufficiently firm, and that by building a narrow stone dam running parallel on the line, all danger of its getting covered ly drift sand mil be- avoided. Only time and labour are required to overcome these difficulties ; and in the construction of the Hedjaz line both are to be had m plenty. 4. Labour. lu Part XIII the difficulty for obtaining labour for the Hedjaz Railway is gone into at Greater length. Although this disadvantage has been for the greater part over come bv employing Turkish troops on the line there still remains the difficulty of o-etting the necessary contractors and workmen for the consti uction of engineering works bridges, stations, buildings, &amp;c. The natives have had but little experience of this sort of work, therefore the assistance of foreigners as managers and artisans is indispemsable^r k oweverj f ear the discomforts of a stay in the desert, and the hardships which they have to bear. Added to this, in consequence of the great d^ynnce from Haifa to the head of the railway, provisions and budding material do not always arrive in time, and thus the normal course of the work is impeded and made more difficult Every kilometre that the line advances into the desert adds to these difficul ties, the communication backwards lengthens and thus increases the need for working material and in consequence the cost. ^18 The best solution of the question of labour and supplies would be to construct a- short branch line south of Ma'an to the sea : or the suggestion of Gehimer Raaret Kapp von Gulstein might be followed, and the line Damascus-Medina, might be me . by a line from Jeddah via Mecca and Medina. P.art IX .—The Work of Construction. To understand the difficulties in the construction of a railway in the desert, it is necessary to cast a glance at the work going on at the nead of the line. Three chief zones of work must l&gt;e distinguished on the section now in course of construction. The most advanced is the reconnoitring (preliminary surveying) zone, then follows the surveying zone, and lastly the building zone. The length of these zones vary according to the conditions of the ground, but it is in general from 50 to 150 kilom. In each zone there are special divisions, which, following the naming of the zones, I shall call the reconnoitring, surveying, and building parties. Since the 1st December, 1905. the preliminary survey party has been working between the stations Tehuk and Medina Salih, the survey party between the stations Mudewwere and Sal-ul-Hadj. Note .—The building partv. having completed the section Mudewwere-Sal-ul- Hadj in the course of this summer (1906). is now at work on the section Sat-ui- Hadj—Tebuk, and the reconnoitring and survey parties have made a corresponding advance. The duty of the reconnoitring party is to make the necessary studies of the ground intended for the railway with compass pedometer and barometer, and to mark out the route of the line. The result of these studies, which take several months, is embodied in a report with accompanying sketch. To carry them out a complete caravan is equipped, frr the reconnoitring party must take with it not only all the necessary technical personnel and instruments, but also, as it is to work on the desert, tents, fuel, and provisions to last throughout the expedition, saddle and pack animals for transport, and a cavalry detachment as guard against Bedouin brigands. Such a caravan consists of:— 1 railway engineer as leader. 2 civil engineers or engineer officers. 1 doctor. 10 railway soldiers to assist in the survey. 20 cavalry as escort, and a number of camel*, horses, and mules for the transport of personnel and provisions. Among the soldiers there is a cook who looks after the feeding of the Company during the expedition. The food consists of Kaurma (tinned, mutton') rice, and rusks. If there is no prosnect of finding water, a supply is carried in goat or sheep skins. A camel carries four or five of these bags, which hold 30 to 40 litres. The nights are spent in tents. Similar caravans are necessary for the survey parties working on the middle zone and following the reconnoitring party. As a rule the surveying zone is divided into three equal parts, and surveyed by three separate parties, each of which has a section of 30 to 50 kilom. Making use of the sketches and plans of the preliminary survey party, these parties establish the exact levels of the projected railway line by means of the tachvmeter. Ec.eh of the three parties puts down the result of these surveys in a book of measure ments, which is submitted to the manager of the engineering works or to the technical bureau which is under his supervision. This bureau, which moves along as the railway advances, is now at Ma’an. In the zone which is furthest back, the real work of constructing the railway i« carried on. In this zone the work is divided as follows : earthworks, that is the making of embankments and cuttings, the substruction of the railway, that is bridges, culverts. &amp;c.. superstructures or bedding, with sleepers and rails. The work is so organized that the infantry detachments, which are scattered over the whole zone of construction, do the earthwork ; contractors and artisans undertake-pftwrmi— 19 the substructure, that is the engineering works, including tunnels and station buildings, and the railway battalions lay the sleepers and rails. The superstructure generally advances more rapidly than the substructure. The contractors necessary for the latter are hard to procure as they object to the hardships they would have to bear, and there are hardly any labourers to be found in these almost unpopulated regions. Bedouins absolutely refuse to carry out earthwork. It therefore sometimes happens that the rails are laid on a part of the line where the substructure (bridges, culverts, &amp;c.) are still very much in arrear. The transport of water to the head of the line has been described in the preceding chapter. Provisions are forwarded in the same manner. Four divisions of the railway troops are at work on the substructures at the same time, viz.:— 1 division for marking 1 the trace. 1 „ laying the bedding. 1 „ laying sleepers. 1 ,, placing the rails. The laying down of the line is performed by hand. 1 he goods train with sleepers and rails is propelled by a light locomotive advancing with the work. This train can pass slowly over the line as soon as the rails are laid on the plates and two bolts and three screws have been put in. _ . . As soon as the men have had a little practice at this work, it was possible in this way to lay 2 to 3 kilom. of rails a-day on the prepared bedding. Further back there are still more parties of men engaged in supplementing the work already done by filling up cavities under the sleepers, repairing embank- The troops live to the right and left of the railway in tent camps that are moved forward as the work progresses. Apart from the consideration that in the legion whic i the railway crosses dwelling-houses are very rare, the quartering of soldiers in villages is avoided on principle in Turkey. ^ c i c m i Each battalion, each company, has a separate camp, where the food for ofhceis and men alike is prepared in one great cauldron. The bread is baked on the spot in portable camp ovens. The soldiers generally work in their cloth uniforms m wmter, in ^summer in white linen suits. As protection from the sum they wear the Arab “ kethje The men continue to receive their regular pay during the time that the) are commanded to the Hedjaz Bailway. Extra pay is granted them at the following rates:— Piastres. 1. Digging out 1 cubic metre of earth o* ^ rock .. .. •• •• 3 ] Gathering up 1 cubic metre of stones from the neighbouring fields and piling them up beside the railway .. • • • • 4 Soreading l cubic metre of stones of the railway .. • • • , c . r \, .. per metre 5.

Presuming that by working hard a man can cut out 3 cubic metres of earth or 1 cubic metre of rock h a day, his extra daily pay amounts to 3 P 1 ' (about 6^ Nor do the other sorts of work yield any greater increase of pay. I he soldier, can only earn pay five days a-week, as Thursday is their washing day and Friday the Turkish Sabbath, and a further reduction m their pay is caused, as only two- 1 n _ the troops work at the railway at one time. The other third is occupied by service m Cam ErtL'paf isalso granted to the officers occupied in the railway construction. Salary and wages are paid by the War Office. Extra pay is defrayed from the '“'The graldG officers and men has borne good fruit, for more work is done and with greater zest. In spite of the comparatively good pay only the greatest economy and seff-sacrifice make it possible to bear for years such a life as the Turkish troops engted on the railway lead on those inhospitable regions But with their eyes fixed southwards towards the holy aim which they have in view, these courageous men bear all the hardships of their lot—the burning hot summer days and the abiupt changes of tempera Je at night, the tortures of thirst, a “ d ^ e tmn Lmmer and winter. Even the severe cholera epidem.c, which in 1J03 attacked 1 3 2 1 0-6 0-620 the troops working np the line and carried oft 100 soldiers within a short time, did not levssen their zeal. This is worthy of special commendation, as most of the soldiers had been kept on “under the flag,” that is to say, at the railway construction longer than the regulation three years, as they were regarded as being on active service. It is not uncommon for these men to serve six years. It may with perfect truth be maintained that, without the extensive help of the troops—by the 1st September. 1904. they had moved 3,800,000 cubic metres of earth— f the construction of the Hedjaz Kailway would have been out of the question, as the necessary labour could not have t&gt;een found in these desert regions, even for high pay. As the railway liattalions are a new creation of the Turkish army, a few words as to their formation and training may be of interest, and may. at the same time, give an idea of the Turkish gift of improvisation. About the time of the Imperial Irade for the building of the railway (1st May, 1900), a second Trade ordered an increase in the army of one railway battalion (No. 1). This battalion was formed in Damascus by suitable men, mostly artisans, from the detachments of the 5th Army Corps, and the gaps in the latter were filled up again by recruits. The officers’ posts were fllled by engineer officers. Some months later it was found necessary to form a second railway battalion to assist in the construction of the railway, as in the first case the men were taken from the 5th Armv Corps in Damascus. This battalion was formed only for the time of construction of the railway, and the gaps caused by the withdrawal of the men from this old detachment were therefore not filled up. The men are considered as still belonging to their old corps, and, in case of mobilization, would return to them. It may, however, be presumed that Kailway Battalion No. 2 will also later on be incorporated with the army. Kecruits joining the railway battalions are at once attached to the troops engaged on the railway, where thev receive their military and technical training. Part X. — Th? Speed and Cost of Building. AJthough the construction of the mil way bet ween Muserib and Der a was begun in. i 900 the progress made was so slight, through the lack of suitable technical direction, that it is not worth taking into account. The regular construction only began on the appointment of Chief Engineer Meissner to be Engineering Manager in January 1901. From that time up to January 190G have been completed— On the main line from Damascus to Mudewwere Kiloni. .. 572 Between Mudewwere and Sat-ul-Hadi, about .. 17 On the branch line from Haifa to Der’a .. •• •• .. 161 Total .. 750 This in five years gives an average of 150 kilom. a-year. This result may be considered favourable in a country which is but sparsely inhabited, and where there is a scarcity of water. The interruptions in the work in the beginning caused by the negotiations with a French Kailway Company, Damascus-Muserib, and the delay in the delivery of sleepers and rails must also be taken into consideration. Let us compare this work with that of the other railways built in Turkey:— The line Ismidt-Angora (121 kilcm. per year) .. 486 kiiom. completed in 4 years. Salonica-Monastir (73 kilom. per year; .. .. 200 „ „ 3*.. Salonica-Dedeeaentch (170 kilom. per year) .. 51ft ,, 3 .. Alashhehir—Afron Kara Hissar (100 kilom. per year) 252 ,, ,, 21 In the construction of the Anatolian Railway also an output of more than. 1 50 kilom. per year was not attained. It must, however, he taken into consideration that the above-mentioned railways are nominal-gauge railways, while the Hedjaz Railway is narrow gauge. Up to September 1903. before the commencement of the costly construction in the Jarudak Valley, the outlay for the Hedjaz Railway, including rolling-stock, station buildings, &amp;c., amounted to £ T. 1,500, equal to about 35,000 piastres, per kilom. The balance-sheets drawn up after the completion of the section through the JarmukValley at the end of 1905 showed a rise to £ T. 2,200, equal to about 50,000 piastres per kilom. But even taking into consideration only this latter sum, the cost of construction may be considered comparatively low. The reason of this cheapness may be ascribed chiefly to the extensive assistance given by the Turkish troops in the building. Part XI.— The Capabilities of the Hedjaz Railway. Having acquainted ourselves with the line and the rolling-stock of the Hedjaz Kailway as well as with the distances between the stations we can judge of the capabilities ol the railway. We will begin with the transport of troops, as the railway will be employed chiefly for this purpose. For such transport the section Damascus-Ma’an first comes into consideration, as it is the shortest way to the Gulf of Acaba, the Ked Sea, and the Arabian vilayets. The longest distance between any two stations on this section is between Djruf-ed- Derwisch and Anese—25‘3 kilom. As there are no steep gradients at this point, the speed which is set at 23 kilom. per hour on the Hedjaz Kailway can here be increased to 27 kilom. The' return journey between these two stations, including the time necessary for the crossing of trains, occupies about two hours. The interval between trains leaving Damascus or those returning from Ma’an must, therefore, be fixed at two hours. Thus, in twenty-four hours, ten military trains could leave Damascus at intervals of two hours, and after the departure of the last train there could be an interval of four hours. On the second day the same number of trains could be dispatched from Damascus, and on the evening of this same day, the first train from Maan could already reach Damascus. The new locomotives on the Hedjaz Kailway (46 tons weight) can all draw a weight of 168 tons at a speed of 23 kilom. per hour. Only on the gradient south of Amman must the speed be diminished to 15 kilom. per hour. A goods waggon loaded with forty men (4 ton) weighs, including its own weight (8 tons) 12 tons. The number of waggons needed for the transport of a battalion of 800 men may be seen from the following computation :— For 800 men, per wa^on 40 men „ 60 pack animals, per waggon 6 animals ,, ammunition tents „ baggage .. ,. officers . . • • • 1 luggage van for officers of battalion .. 1 cistern waggon for train W ug&lt;&gt;cms. Tons 20 — 260 10 120 1 23 1 23 1 23 1 12 1 12 3 105 Total 38 558 As ten trains of 168 tons weight could be sent from Damascus in one day it would be possible to transport three battalions from Damascus to Ma’an m one day, provided that the regular working of the railway was assured by a sufficient supply of water As the distance, Damascus-Ma an, is 458 kilom. the journey could be done comfortably in twenty-four hours by one of these transport trams at a speed of 23 kilom. allowing for the necessary stops at stations and sidings. Similar records were made by the railway at its opening. # . On the 30th August, 1904, the participants m the inauguration festivities were sent in five special trains (including one provision train) dispatched at intervals of two hours from Damascus to Maan. In spite of an official reception at each station, which greatly lengthened the regular time of stoppage, the first tram arrived at Maan withm the twenty-four hours. In thirty-two hours all the trains had arrived at their In summer 1905 also, twenty-eight Syrian battalions destined to quell the disturbances in the Yemen were dispatched from Damascus to Ma an, though m this case at irregular intervals. These trams took one or two days to reach their destination. The time of passage was increased by the long stops made at night. r*2223 cc —H GFrom Ma an the troops made their journey to Acaha, 110 to 120 kilom. in four days, a very creditable performance, when one takes into consideration that they had to march over strong broken ground, without any regular roads, At Acaha the troops were shipped to Hodeidah, which they reached in five days. 22 Part XII .—The projected Branch Line Ma'an Amman and Acaha- Es Salt. { A glance at the map is sufficient to demonstrate the great strategic and economic advantages of a branch line Ma’an-Acaba. By means of such a railway Turkey would be in direct touch with the Red Sea, and make itself independent of the Suez Canal, by way of which all communication between Turkey and the Arabian provinces takes place. The cost to the Turkish Government of this route may be seen when one considers that 10 fr. duty per ton has to be paid on every vessel passing through the Canal. The strategic advantages of a railway connection Ma’an-Acaba consists chiefly in the fact that in case of disturbances in the Arabian provinces troops could be transported to the sphere of action much more quickly than by way of the Suez Canal. As was seen in the previous chapter, in summer 1905, part of the Syrian troops required for the suppression of disorder in the Yemen were moved to Hodeidah in ten to eleven days, while the transport of the Turkish troops via the Suez Canal took weeks to accomplish. As is known, the building of the branch line Ma’an-Acaba has been abandoned in consequence of the frontier dispute between Egypt and 'turkey. This necessitates Turkey finding another outlet to the sea south of the Ma’an, which she urgently requires, not only for the afore-mentioned reasons, but also that the building material for the Hedjaz Railway and the provisions for the troops and labourers employed in the building may be brought more quickly to the head of the railway. The route via H;dfa is too long, so that interruptions even now occur in the transport of goods, besides which it requires too much rolling-stock and causes enormous expense. If the Hedjaz Railway is successful in establishing a communication with the Red Sea south of Ma’an, it will be both quicker and cheaper to procure railway material and provisions, and the whole work of construction will proceed more smoothly and speedily. Such a connection would, for instance, be practicable between Acaba and Mudewwere, where the ground is particularly favourable to the laving of a railway. The country between Tebuk and Dhaba (Siba), or Tebuk and Muveila, would also be suitable for the construction of a branch line. According to native information, camel riders cover the distance from Tebuk to Dhaba in two and a-half days. In any case, the latter branch line project presents fewer engineering difficulties than the one from Ma’an to Acaba. Ma’an is about 110 kilom. (as the crow flies) from Acaba. The difference in level between the two places is 1,074 metres. From Ma’an the railway would have to rise 1,600 metres in about 30 kilom., and would then, following the Wadi-el-Araba, descend in steeper gradients to the flat shore of the Red Sea. The upper part of the valley especially, which descends 600 to 800 metres in 10 kilom., would require engineering works of tooo- The total length of the branch line Ma’an-Acaba would have to be 150 to 160 kilom., about the same as the branch line Haifa-Der’a, and its cost would probably be the same. Even though the construction of the branch line Ma’an-Acaba has been given up, the advisability of thoroughly examining this neighbourhood with a view to building a military road to facilitate the eventual transport of troops should be considered. On a road of this sort—100 kilom. long-—the gradient need not exceed , and the sharpest curve would be 10 metres radius. On completion of this road troops could cover the distance, between MaAn-Acaba on foot, without difficulty in three days, provided that there were two halting places with barracks on the way where the necessary water could be obtained. For the present a telegraphic connection between Ma’an and Acaba has been established by the troops, with one intermediate station. It is served by military telegraph clerks. The projected branch line Amman-es-Salt (38 kilom.) is for the purpose of opening up the phosphate beds between these two places, which, as has already been mentioned, have been handed over to the Hedjaz Railway for exploitation. This branch would also be the beginning of a connection between the Hedjaz Railway and the English line Jaffa— Jerusalem, and so would lead with a further communication with the sea.The phosphate beds are very important, and contain 55 per cent, to 85 per cent, phosphates. They extend over several square kilometres, and are 20 metres deep. Recent estimates of the cost of exploiting the phosphate beds and of the transport to the European markets have awakened doubts as to the profitableness of the undertaking, and so the surveys for this branch line have for the present been discontinued. Part Xlli. — Continuation of the Line to Mecca. How will the further construction of the Hedjaz Railway shape itself? When can we count on the completion of the line to Mecca ? These questions force themselves upon any one who has seen for himself the difficulties with which the Hedjaz Railway has to contend. To answer them, an- examination of Moukhtar Bey’s report is necessary. In this report all the circumstances which tend to hasten or impede the progress of the railway through the desert region between Mudewwere and Mecca are considered from an engineering point of view. At the same time it gives a general picture of a land which has not been the object of much scientific research. Consequently I have kept as closely as possible to the Turkish original, a translation of which I append (see Appendix I). In judging of the report it must not be forgotten that Moukhtar Bey had an opportunity of examining only those districts through which the pilgrim caravans passed, a deviation from which for surveying purposes was out of the question. Moukhtar Bey sums up the result of his survey as follows: — “ The railway will meet with few engineering difficulties between Mudewwere and Mecca. The trace will necessitate neither costly tunnels, big bridges, nor other extensive engineering works. The railway could therefore be built at a cost of £ T. 2,400 per kilom. or even less, if other special conditions did not make it more expensive. “ The price of building will, hoAvever, be increased for the following reasons :— “ i. The road passes through very dry land, where water is found not only in very small quantities, but also at points far apart. The procuring of water for the building and working of the railway will therefore be extremely difficult and increase its cost. Between Ma an and Medina it would be necessary to assure a supply of water a year beforehand; that is to say that where water was to be got by boring, these borings would have to be made a year before the construction of the railway on that section, and where it was not to be had by boring, covered cisterns would have to be built, which would collect the rain-water and protect it from evaporation. “If a supply of water were not assured in time, the work would frequently be' interrupted for want of it, and the building programme for the year in question could not be carried out. “ 2 . In the whole neighbourhood between Mudewwere and Medina which the road crosses there are no villages. The nomadic Bedouins of this district are unaccustomed to work and it would be difficult to obtain their assistance. Labourers will therefore have to be brought from other places. It is clear that they will demand higher wages than men working near their villages. “ 3. The further into the desert the railway advances the greater will be the cost per kilometre; for the further the building material has to_ be transported, the more locomotives, waggons and coal are required for the working of the railway. I he personnel also will have to be increased to a corresponding extent. “4 A crreater number of troops will be required to protect the workers on the line, guard the building material, &amp;c., and this too will increase the cost.” The objections mentioned in 2nd and 4th have been for the greater part overcome by the employment of the Turkish troops in the construction, who at the same time take over the work of guarding the line. Points 1 and 2, however, remain, and will increase the cost of building in proportion as the railway approach es^ Mecca. To make these disadvantages less perceptible, it would be advisable to commence the Hedjaz Railway from a second point—from Jeddah, and to first build the section Jeddah Mecca, and then to work via Medina towards the main line coming from 33 clIO cLSCU s \t the close of his report Moukhtar Bey illustrates the great financial and moral advantages which would accrue from the building of the railway from Jeddah to Mecca, and warmly advocates the construction of this section.24 In this he is supported by Geheimer Baurat Kapp von Gulstein, an authority on railway construction in the East, who, in his report to the General Commission in Constantinople after an inspection of the railway in autumn 1905, brings forward, tue following interesting considerations and proposals. “ There are two ways to bring the Hedjaz Railway enterprise to a successful issue :— 1. The continuation to Medina (1,400 kilom.), and to Mecca (1,800 kiiom.) of the railway built from Damascus, which on the 1st January, 1906, had attained a length of 590 kilom. o 2 . The commencement of the railway at a second point by building the section Jeddah-Mecca, and from there working northwards to meet the railway running in the direction of Medina. “ 1. At the present rate of construction (an average of 150 kilom. per annum) the completion of the railway might be counted on to Medam Salih (360 kilom.) in about two years, or the 31st December, 1907; to Medina (800 kijom.) in about five years, or the 31st December, 1910; to Mecca (1,200 kilom.) in about eight years, or the 31st December, 1913. “2. Should it, on the contrary, be decided to build the line during the year 1906, from Jeddah to Mecca (7 kilom.), which might be completed by September 1907, it would be easy, during the years 1908-1910 to build the 400 kilom. between Mecca and Medina, and at the end of 1910 to effect the connection with the main line comine; from Damascus. By this means the Hedjaz Railway would be completed three years sooner and through the line Jeddah-Mecca would have gained another valuable outlet to the sea. According to Moukhtar Bey’s report (Annex 2) the building of the section Jeddah- Mecca would present hardly any difficulties. The necessary gradients would not exceed to^o and the curves would not be below a radius of 300 metres. Kapp von Gulstein estimates the cost of the line Jeddah-Mecca, including rolling-stock and station buildings at 3,750,000 fr., presuming that 1,000 Turkish troops are told off to assist in the work of construction. But as the yearly income of the Hedjaz Railway, amounting to 7’5 million francs will be required for further construction of the main line Damascus-Mecca, which advances 150 kilom. each year, the General Commission would either have to develop new sources of income, or borrow money for the line Jeddah—Mecca and its continuation to Medina, on the security of fixed revenue granted to the General Commissioners by the Government out of stamp duties, &amp;c. One can only agree with Kapp von Gulstein when he considers such a loan as par ticularly profitable. At the same time he proves that the railway Jeddah-Mecca would pay its way by the following computation :— “Mecca, with its environs has about 100,000 inhabitants, the food for whom all comes exclusively by way of Jeddah. Counting but 300 kilog. per head per year, with' a transport tariff of 0*05 fr. per ton and kilom.— Fr. The transport would yield an ineome per annum of .. .. . . 1,500 Assuming the number of pilgrims going from Jeddah to Mecca at the minimum of 30,000, a fare of 0T0 fr. per kilom. there and the same back would yield 0-20 fr. x 30,000 = .. . . .. .. • • • - 6,000 Substracting the working expenses per year and kilom. .. .. .. 3,000 There remains per year and kilom. .. .. .. .. .. 4,500 “ This sum represents the net income for an outlay of 3,750,000 fr. = 8 per cent. When one considers that the pilgrims pay 6-7 medjidies—50-60 piastres for the journey from Jeddah to Mecca, and as much for the return journey—it must be granted that the price of 2 75, 0*10 = 15 piastres for a return railway ticket is very low. “ The price might be doubled or trebled, or the pilgrims might be made to pay X E. 1 for the return railway journey, as a contribution to the building fund of the Hedjaz Railway. The yearly income of the section Jeddah-Mecca would then rise from £ T. 13,000 to £ T.'43,000, and, in spite of this, the pilgrims would save money and make the journey more comfortably.“ On the absence ot curves on this line, 480 pilgrims m twelve good tracks, could he taken from Jeddah to Mecca in two hours (40 kilom. per hour) if there were three locomotives of 30 tons, fifty good trucks of 15 tons and fifteen passenger waggons (already included in the total cost of 3,750,000 fr. as rolling-stock on this line), three trains (the goods trucks to he used for third class passengers) could be sent off in the day, each of which could make the journey four times. In this way 5,760 pilgrims could be forwarded from Jeddah to Mecca daily. So that the above assumed number of pilgrims could cover this section by rail in one week.” Lastly, Kapp von Gulstein adduces the following reasons for the necessity for building; the line Jeddah-Mecca :— “ 1. The Moslem world which choses the route via Jeddah for the pilgrimage to Mecca—by far the greater part of the pilgrims—and which has contributed voluntary offerings for the Hedjaz Railway, sees nothing of this railway construction which is being carried on north of Medina. Whereas a railway from Jeddah to Mecca would give the generous donors a visible proof that this money was being well spent, and would encourage them to make fresh sacrifices. “ 2. Through the railway, Jeddah-Mecca, a new outlet to the sea would be created for the Hedjaz Railway. The transport trains, which would have_ to forward railway building material a distance of 1,500 kilom. (Median) and 1,900 kilom. (Mecca), would be an enormous expense (the railway transport to Medina would amount to 106 tons X 0'05 fr. X 1,500 = 7,950 fr., and to Mecca 106 X 0‘05 X 1,900 = 10,0/0 fr.), which would be almost out of the question. “It would therefore he better to divide into two the 1,200 krlom. of the line Damascus-Mecca, which, on the 1st January, 1906, still remained to be constructed and begin the building of the southern half from Mecca or Jeddah. In any case it would be best to begin the construction of the 400 kilom. between Mecca and Medina from the southern end. TT ... T , .. u •. To save three years in the construction of the Hedjaz Railway would result in infinitesimal political and moral advantages. Considerations of foreign policy would have to be waived in view of the great importance which the railway Jeddah-Mecca would have for the advancement and rapid completion of the main line Damascus Such are the considerations advanced by Kapp von Gulstein So far there lias been no official intimation that his proposals, the great advantages of which are obvious^ have been entertained by those in authority. A1 that one sees is that vork is being pushed along the main line Damascus-Medina with great energy.

Taking into consideration the reloading in Rajak and other possible delays, about six days would have to be counted for the transport of ... Neither in the East Jordan district nor in the Hedjaz are there at present any industries of note, though they might be developed. At Wady Sirhan, near the foot of the spurs of the volcanic Hanram Mountains, near Kef and Etseri, salt is found, which is only exploited partially and in the most primitive manner by the inhabitants of these villages. The salt is carried to Damascus on camels, and is there greatly esteemed on account of its quality. In the Hanran-Adjling regions there are sulphur and petroleum springs, which till the present have remained almost untouched. Iron ore and other metals—to what extent is not even known—were also to be found. In the Adjling district (near Jedar) there are large quarries where large, excellent mill-stones are got. It may be expected that the railway will further the exploitation of these mineral treasures. The old Roman mines of the land of Midian, now in ruins, and even now rich in silver, and especially turquoises, will perhaps take a new lease of life. .... Herr von Kapp expresses himself as to the railway paying its way as The yearly income of the section Haifa—Der a—Damascus, and maybe also Der’a— Amman (together 385 kilom.), will hardly exceed 3,000 fr. per kilom. As the whole Haifa line in the wild valleys of the Jarmuk and Jordan will contribute nothing, and the section on the plain of Jezreel but little, owing to the camel competition near the sea, the whole income, therefore, must come from the Hanran, and this income will have to be shared with the line Muserib-Damascus. The income may suffice to cover the working expenses. The whole of the long section south of Amm&amp;n will, however, remain without any income worth mentioning. The Mecca pilgrims travel free of charge, and the few tourists who will travel every year to Petra via Ma’an will make no appreciable difference. It is intended to regard the line south of the Ma’an as a purely military railway and to hand over the working of it, with one train a week, to the railway battalions. “ With such a limited amount of traffic the expenses can be covered by 1 500 fr per kilom., which makes a yearly outlay of 2'5 million francs for the 1,600 kilom’. under consideration. As, however, at least a part of the taxes created for the payment of the construction of the Hedjaz Railway can still be levied alter the completion of the railway, there is no reason to fear that the enterprise will come to an untimely end for want of funds.” J Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Newspaper Extracts. Extract from the “ Ikdam” of August 19 (September 1), 1906. ON this glorious day takes place the opening of the portion of the Hedjaz Railway extending from Damascus to the 692nd kilometre, which coincides with the sacred city of Tebuk. This extraordinary work, accomplished in such a short time, is self-speakW evidence of the numerous successes of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan. It is to be hoped also, that the remaining portion of the Hedjaz line, which stands so high and so- * On account of the ri^e in the Taurus.27 :ins portof 1 preset ■ near tie ; is founij rbabitantj, re grea 1 ' ei Ir®, )uni In «miseral even boi way as so Dei jhe wMe hing, d cover tie however, il free of 1,500 fr, a. unOer n of tlie end for ed cify } , tof» and so 1 sacred before the eyes of all the Moslems, will happily reach an end very soon, so that the pilgrims within reach of these facilities will be able to go and pray in those holy regions. Is it possible to conceive any other religious service more sublime than this ? The whole Moslem nation is naturally proud of the accomplishment of such a super human and sacred work of our illustrious Sovereign, work, accumulating in itself all the greatest, religious, and non-religious, advantages. Its moral advantages, besides the advantages of securing, at the same time, the welfare of all the faithful there, are beyond inception. This huge line, which is to surpass 2,000 kilom., will revive and immerge into prosperity and wealth all those regions. Especially as the Hedjaz line will be joined by branch lines to the great Bagdad line, no single point of the vast Turkish Empire will remain deprived of profiting from the infinite resulting advantages. Bemarkable also is the extraordinary speed exhibited since the beginning of the construction of the Hedjaz line up to this date, because the distance from Damascus to Tebhk. requiring all the way along bridges, tunnels, and lots of other things, which of course require time ; thanks, nevertheless, to the praiseworthy measures taken by His Imperial Majesty, everything attained its end with extraordinary rapidity. Every single person hopes, and most sincerely wishes, that such a noble work, attracting both God’s satisfaction and the Prophet’s contentment, should be accomplished as soon as possible. It is quite obvious that as the most important part of the great line was finished in a very short time, the remaining portion also, will attain its end before ^ We are happy in publishing to-day herewith the progress made with the line, as well as a detailed account of all the receipts and expenses made up to date.

Effort of the High Committee of the Hamidie-Hedjaz Eailway to his Excellency Izz©t Pasha, Second Secretary of the Palace. As already ^ reported, the trains conveying the Special Committee and all other members, to assist m the inauguration of the Hedjaz Eailway to the sacred Tebdk point, started from Damascus amidst all the honours of dignity and the tune of Tmperial music, which all the way was continuously playing. Enormous crowds of people were standing in front of the various stations splendidly decorated, and, together with all the school pupils, they were exclaiming, ‘ c May the Lord help the Sultan.” In this way the Committee arrived yesterday at Tebuk. Early this morning all of us were wearing our official uniforms and our decorations, and in the company of all the Chiefs of thevarious tribes, the leading members, merchants and others, proceeded to the Mosque* and after making our morning prayer, we prayed also for His Majesty’s health, after which we returned to the magnificently decorated tents, where general congratula tions were proposed to His Majesty’s name. The Committee, with the one battalion accompanying it, and all the crowd again offered prayers. The Inspector of the Damascus line wished for the full success of His Majesty’s intentions, and delivered a few speeches appropriate to the occasion. Numerous sheep were sacrificed as usual, and after my delivering the following oration. His Majesty’s special envoy, his Excellency Rahim Pasha, read aloud the telegram of our beloved Sovereign, through which the Imperial greetings and satisfaction were transmitted to me. The whole congregation prayed again in great enthusiasm for the long life of the Sultan, and then the band played the Hamidie March, and the inau guration ceremony was accomplished. Then those of the soldiers, who proved worthy to be released from working in the construction of the line, received with flags in hand their tezkeres, the commemorative medal of the line graciously sent for them, as w T ell as one month’s wages as a present; and for all these benevolences, with tears in their eyes, raised to the Lord their inmost prayers for the precious health of His Majesty. Afterwards, all those present traversed by rail every single point constructed, and in two and a-half hours a distance of 2 kilom. was travelled with extraordinary speed, and thus the fine work accomplished by the troops has been admired by everybody. Five times during this, glorious day cannon were fired, splendid illuminations were to be seen the whole night everywhere, and a general enthusiasm was to be remarked. To-morrow morning the Special Committee will proceed to Haifa. August 19, 1322. Telegram sent from the first divisionary his Excellency Rahmi Pasha, Aide-de-camp of His Majesty, and a member of the High Committee of Military Inspection, to his Excellency Izzet Pasha, Second Secretary of the Imperial Palace. Early in the morning of this sacred holiday for the whole of Islam, which coincides with the anniversary of the Imperial accession, we all went to the Holy Mosque of Tebuk, and there morning prayers were read by the Mufti of Damascus. Further prayers were raised for His Majesty s precious health, at the end of which we passed in front of the standing Imperial troops, and went to the great tent, erected behind a beautiful arch, where, the music playing the Hamidie march, the ceremony of congratulations took place, and refreshments and coffee were offered to all those present. • . . A multitude of Arabs coming from Medina and Syria, prayed again for His Majesty, sheep were immolated, several speeches delivered, and thus the inauguration of the Tebuk portion of the great Hamidie-Hedjaz Railway line has been magnificently celebrated. In the meantime I transmitted the Imperial greetings to the troops and all the eminent persons of the congregation ; at the same time the inauguration of the newly built Mosque of Tebuk, as well as of the placing of the foundation stone of the military hospital of Tebhk having taken place, twenty-one cannon sent by Imperial^ order from Damascus were fired, and amidst the most enthusiastic exclamations of “ Lon o' live the Sultan,” medals, wages, and tezkeres were distributed to a\l the retiring soldiers of the construction battalions ; then a beautiful military review 0 f fpe battalions found here took place, the cavalry detachments, and a great many Bedouin cavalry gladly joined in the party, and thus the whole ceremony mi st imposingly ended with the repeated exclamations of Padishahim tchok yasha.” August 19, 1322.,30 Extract from the “ Jkdam” of August 23 (September 5), 1906.

Cannon fired five times during the glorious day of yesterday, were announcing each time the sacred character of the day, and all the Sheikhs and Bedouins, who arrived in Tebuk, Imperial troops and other visitors, were exclaiming prayers that the Lord may help our Sovereign. All the day through, mutual congratulations were expressed, and at 9 o’clock we went to a distance of 2 kilom. from Tebuk where all present assisted in carrying cross-bars. Then the Imperial troops completed a distance of 1,200 metres in the course of an hour and a-half, and we afterwards returned to Tebuk, where pilaff, with meat, halvas (sort of cake), and refreshments were duly served to all the Sheikhs and Bedouins, and various other delicious dishes to the troops and the visitors. At night the whole city was splendidly illuminated with thousands of lanterns, artificial fires were burned, and the greatest enthusiasm lasted up to the morning. Exclamations for the Sultan’s health were to be heard everywhere, and early in the morning we started for Haifa. On our arrival to-morrow in Damascus, the money presents of our beloved Sovereign will be distributed to each one of the artillery and band officers, as well as to all the other simple soldiers of your Excellency, &amp;c.

I HAVE the honour to report to your Excellency that the Hedjaz Eaiiway construction work, with the exception of ballasts on few sections, has been completely carried out as far as'* Tebuk on the 700th kilometre from Damascus. On the 28th ultimo a Commission, composed of the Eerik Eahmi Pasha and the Major Naji Bey, arrived here from Constantinople via Beyrout, and was received with all kinds of pomp and respect by the Vali and the other officials of the vilayet, who went out on a special train to meet the Committee at Eyak, 75 kilom. from Damascus. On the morning of the next day the Commission, accompanied by his Excellency Kyazim Pasha, Nazir of the Hedjaz line, the Mufti of Damascus, the Haj Muhafizi, and many others of the high officials of Damascus and Beyrout, proceeded on a Hedjaz train for Tebuk to hold there the ceremonies of inaugurating that section of the line on the 1st September, which is the anniversary of the Accession Day of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan. They arrived at their destination on the evening of the 31st ultimo and celebrated the fete on the 1st instant with all zeal and enthusiasm, encouraging the workmen, distributing medals, and disbanding those of the troops employed on the line who had completed their terms of service. On the 2nd they returned to Dera’a, and the majority of them took Haifa line to see Eahmi Pasha and Naji Bey off to Constantinople. In this connection I beg to sum up the progress made in the construction of the Hedjaz Eaiiway up to this memorable occasion. Including Dera’a-Haifa branch of 160 kilom., the trains now run over 860 kilom. built during the last five years, with the exception of good many stations and ballast still to be laid on about 100 kilom. between Mudevrera and Tebuk. Earthworks are now going on energetically on about 250 kilom. between Tebuk and Medain Salih, out of which 30 kilom. immediately after Tebuk are now nearly completed. The moving stock in possession of the Eaiiway Commission consists of 25 locomotives, 40 covered wagons, 250 platforms, 50 third-class, 10 first-class, and 2 “ de luxe ” passenger carriages, and 19 water tanks. Many others had been ordered from German and Belgian firms. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. P. DEVEY. [2174 h —3] !

(No. 507. Confidential.) Sir, Therapia, July 24, 1906. WITH reference to my despatch No. 401, Confidential, of the 12th June, I have the honour to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a Memorandum which has been prepared by Mr. G. A. Lloyd, Honorary Attache to His Majesty’s Embassy, concerning the reports which have from time to time appeared in the press to the eftect that the Hedjaz Railway is the outcome of German activity in this country, and is being employed as a means of propagating German influence. Mr. Lloyd, while showing how erroneous this impression is, explains the advantages of the railway from a strategic and Pan-Islamic point of view; it is, however, open to doubt whether the Hedjaz Railway is destined to succeed as an industrial enterprise,*or whether, in view of the fact that there is practically no goods traffic on the line, and that the passenger traffic is confined to two or three months in the year, it is economically possible for it to continue to exist. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Lloyd respecting German Influence on the Hedjaz Railway. FOR some time past, and especially since the late Akaba incident became prominent, there has been a noticeable tendency on the part of the press in England to adduce as an additional and new proof of the extent of German influence and activity in the Ottoman Dominions the construction of the Hedjaz Railway, and to see in this enter prise a dangerous weapon in the hands of Germany that may some day strike a blow against British Islamic influence. 1 think, then, it may be desirable at this time to make a few remarks on the real nature of this enterprise, which may perhaps serve to show that, at present at all events, the railway shows no signs of being anything more than a purely Turkish enterprise, and the outcome of a natural desire on the part of the Sultan to achieve an important and twofold object—(1) religious, (2) strategical; in the first to draw closer to the seat of the Caliphate the Holy Places on whose control that Caliphate depends, and in the second to provide a safe means of transit for and to facilitate the rapid dispatch of troops to a portion of his dominions which is at present so largely out of touch with Constantinople as to render very difficult the military control which tiie Yemen has lately shown itself to be seriously in need of if the Sultan intends to exercise anything more than a very nominal suzerainty over South-Western Arabia. These two objects are of such obvious importance to the welfare of and continuance of the Ottoman rule that they call for no further remark, and constitute, it will, I think, be admitted, an all-sufficing reason in themselves for the building of the railway without bringing up any question of German political ambitions in Syria and Arabia. The Germans, who hold a far greater interest in the railways in Turkey than any other Power, might naturally be expected to entertain ambitions to the control of the Hedjaz Railway, both in pursuance of their steady and increasing interests in Anatolia and as a natural sequence to their constant attempts to depreciate the value of British Moslem influence in this part of the world. Could it not be shown that the Hedjaz Railway does not in the present, or, indeed, in the future, appear to be going to be at all an adaptable German weapon for the furtherance of these ambitions ? Let us examine the case more closely. To begin with, the inception of the Hedjaz Railway was founded on no Con cession, as in the case of all other railways in Turkey, which could at any future time Le made the object of a commercial or political transaction in the way of transference [2062 ^-1]2 of ownership to a new concessionnaire. The enterprise, being built by means of money raised from Mahommedans in all parts of the Turkish Empire, has no share capital and belongs, in fact, to the Turkish people, and as such is a purely national concern. It is Moslem in its origin and in its realization, and as such, it may be remarked, is an interesting example as much of the vitality of Turkish enterprise when called upon to promote the interests of Islam as of the remarkable elasticity of Turkish finance, which, though hopelessly crippled in every European financial sense of the word, yet is able bv an appeal to Islam to raise without difficulty sufficient “ voluntary contributions for such an immense undertaking. The railway, then, having no share capital the possibilitv of Germany or any other Christian Power attempting to obtain a controlling interest is completely eliminated, and it seems unlikely that the fcultan would ever dare to enter into anv negotiations to hand over the control to a Christian Power ot a railway that has been built by Moslem contributions aud leading to the Holy Places. The question, then, of any definite German control in the future is, I think, sufficients disposed of; but it may be urged that, apart from any definite control, the railwav mav become, through the influence that Germany has succeeded m obtaining at the Palace* a channel for the dissemination of German influence into the Hedjaz. It would appear that such an opinion can only be the result of an imperfect appreciation of the real facts of the case. Such influence could only be used through indirect agents such as German engineers and employes engaged in working on the line, and could have little effect or weight with Moslems, who are willing, faute de mieux,to make use of the superior knowledge and engineering capacity of the foreigner, but who, once the construction of the line is completed, must only remain in subordinate positions on the administration of the line. , . It is also a grave question whether, once the line approaches Medina and gets tar into the Hediaz, the German engineers now employed on the line will be allowed to continue their work. It is more probable that they will be called upon to train up and instruct Moslem engineers for the carrying on of the work in its later sections, m which case any influence that might possibly have been exercised through their agency will be cut off*before the line reaches the district in which such influence might have anv effect. In support of this idea I may mention that a notice appeared in the Turkish newspaper “ Ikdam,” in its issue of the 14th July, saying that a special branch of the “ Ecole Technique has been started for the instruction of men destined to become employes in the Hedjaz Railway, and that eighteen students have already commenced work with this object. _ A considerable amount of stress appears to have been laid upon the fact that toe engineer in charge of the construction is a German. Before Herr Meissner obtained the appointment engineers of various nationalities had been engaged, and it is owing to his capacities as an engineer, more than to the accident of his nationality, that his influential position on the line must be attributed. Owing to the interest that Germany has taken in railway enterprise in Anatolia, as exemplified in the German management of the Anatolian, Bagdad, Mersina-Adana Railways, many more German than English engineers have been attracted to Turkey, and the appointment of Herr Meissner to administrate the Hedjaz Railway is the natural result of this influx of German engineers and cannot be looked upon as the result of an attempt at establishing political influence in those parts. It should, however, not be overlooked that Germany does reap one very practical and important advantage in Herr Meissner’s appointment, which is undoubtedly the reason of what interest she has in the construction of the line. By the appointment of Herr Meissner she secures certain commercial advantages over all other nations. The giving of contracts for all supplies and materials, rails, locomotives. &amp;c., for the railway is almost entirely in his hands, and it is remarkable that, whereas before his appointment America supplied a large quantity of rails for the line, since his appointment almost all the rails and locomotives have been supplied from Germanv. As far as I can ascertain, all the contracts for locomotives have more recentlv* been given to the German firm of Messrs. Kreutz, the Belgian engines on the line having been supplied before his taking charge. Germany thus gets at any rate a preferential treatment on equal terms, a preference, it must be fairly said, perfectly 'compatible with his duties to the High Commission, but a preference which is of immense value to German manufacturers, especially in the supply of steel rails, where competition is very keen. The importance to Germany, then, from a commercial point of view, purely as regards the supplyof materials, is undoubted, but this is an advantage that wifl do little to stimulate the* most important form of trade, namely, a steady and permanent trade, and has thus only a passing importance. The commercial importanceof the railway in future is very doubtful; cultivation extends only between Damascus and Amman, and that only on the edge of the railway, and the remainder of the route is one of absolute desert from which no trade can be expected. Of the through traffic that may be carried in the future it is scarcely possible to speak, but even in the very unlikely event of the quantity being existent, it may be quite safely asserted that the distance of carriage would completely check the trade, and it appears that the railway is destined, for a long time to come, to depend entirely upon passenger receipts, almost completely to be drawn from the carriage to and from Mecca annually of pilgrims for the Haj. Such are the commercial prospects of the railway, and it is hard to see where lies the pecuniary bait to tempt a commercial nation like Germany. Of the political use of the line as a method of disseminating German influence in Arabia I have already spoken, and I venture to think that it is fairly clear that German influence as exercised at present by means of the railway amounts to little or nothing in a direct way, at any rate nothing that cannot be forestalled by keeping a careful watch on the developments of the line. Apart from this, but indirectly connected with it, there are one or two points that cannot be overlooked when estimating the importance of the Hedjaz Railway, and in them lie a certain source of danger to British influence, which, though somewhat indefinable, is none the less real and must not be omitted from mention, especially as they do not appear to have been touched upon before in direct connection with the Hedjaz Railway. I refer to the recent activity in cable and telegraph line laying by Germany as exemplified by the Berlin-Constanza-Constantinople telegraph line. During the last few days only an arrangement has been concluded between Germany and the Turkish Post Office Administration, by which Germany lends to the said Administration 400,000 fr. to put the telegraph line from Constantinople to El Arish in good condition, and to insure the efficient working of the same. The capital and the interest on this sum is to be paid out of the receipts of the line, and the work has already been started, and completed as far as Pendik. I am informed by the Director of the Eastern Telegraph Company here that the object of the Germans in this loan is to insure good telegraphic communication for themselves direct from Berlin to Egypt independent of British lines, and though this scheme was initiated before the development of the recent events in Egypt, it is a matter whose importance should not be lost sight of should any complication of a similar nature arise in the future. I am also informed by the same source that Germany is contemplating a telegraph line to link up Gaza and Akaba, from whence it is intended to take the line to Jeddah, with the ultimate object of completing from Jeddah a cable to Dar-es-Salaam in German East Africa. Apart from the ultimate conclusion of the Hedjaz Railway to Mecca, it may be well to draw attention to the strategical importance from the Turkish point of view that the line will very shortly commence to have on its arrival at Medain-Saleh. The line has already reached Zat-el-Haj, which is scarcely 150 miles from Medain-Saleh, and, once arrived there, the centre and heart of the Nejd district becomes immediately in touch with the railway. Hail, the capital of the Ibn Rashid family, is separated from Medain- Saleh only by some four or five dromedary marches, and so it is that the railway will have a very important effect upon the politics of the Rejd, and it may be due to this fact that the Sultan recently decided, after the death of Ibn Rashid, to continue to support the fallen fortunes of that family against the superior forces of Ibn Saoud, and it is this aspect of the Hedjaz Railway more than any direct German influence that is the most important point to be dealt on from the British point of view. In conclusion 1 may venture to remark that the Pan-Islamic movement, in which Germany has shown such an interest of late, is not likely to be affected by the com mercial interest that she has taken in the line between Damascus and Maan, and a little more experience of the Moslem may help her to realize that Pan-Islamism is a weapon that may be used against more than one nation, and that in any case her penetration into the Hedjaz would, more likely than not, be fraught with considerably more danger than success.

Si r, With reference to your despatch No. 2768 E.B Confidential of June BJOjth I have the honour to return the trace from the map of Syria shewing the alignment and branches of the Hedjaz Railway together with the list of names, in which the Arabic equivalents have been duly filled in with their vowels , I may point out that the original intention of running a branch line from Ma 'an to Akaba has been abandoned owing to the difficulty of the country ana the consequent expense and the present intention is go build a branch that shall connect Akaba with Kalaat al-Mudawara, where easier gradients, etc., would be met with. I notice that the appended trace does not go beyond Kalaat al-Mudawara and, as the construction has now progressed some distance beyond,' as jar as Daf el-Hamra, 87C kilometres from Damascus, I have consequently added to the list oj names tnose Oj ^he principal stations between Kalaat-al-Mudawara and Me da’in Salih.

I have the honour to transmit herewith a photographic copy of a Turkish map sketched by Hajji Moukhtar Bey, technical adviser to the Hedjaz Railway and ccmpi 1 ed by Cep)tain Sumer Zekki and Lieut . liassan Muayin. The mop shows traces of the whole railway to Mecca with the proposed connection to Jeddah , and has the distances between stations indicated on the ■ margin. Although I fear that the Turkish map is only based on a rough survey, yet it should be useful in giving a g meral idea of the Railway scheme as a whole, and is probably the most accurate map of those* regions obtainable anywhere at present. I append thereto a list of stations compiled from this m,ap giving approximately accurate distances between Damascus and each station. The Sultan has expressed his wish for the rapid completion of the line as far as Me da in Sal in and the work is being pushed on with all possible energy. As an evidence of the interest being shown by His Majesty in the Railway I may mention that at his orders attempts have lately been made to interest the people of Medina m the line and to overcome tne religious repugnance that might be jel'; through the supplanting by the Railway of their camel traffic to which they have been accustomed from time immemorial.

By the desire of the Central Committee of the Hedjaz Railway Fund, I have the honour to represent the following facts and to request that you will be so good as to lay the same for the kind consideration and order of His Excellency the Viceroy. The construction of a Railway in Hedjaz having been authorised by the Turkish Government the work has been taken in hand but its completion de pends upon the pecuniary support of the Muhammadans at large* The Muham madans of Hyderabad (Deccan) have therefore formed an association which is designated the Central Committee of the Hedjaz Railway Fund and I have the honour of being its Honorary Secretary. The object of the Committee is to raise subscription throughout the Indian Empire and I have been deputed by them to open its branches in every important place to assist them in their noble object. Having visited the Province of Behar I have reached Calcutta, the metropolis of India to establish a branch, I take the liberty to state that by far the largest number of pilgrims including females of all classes who annually proceed to the Hedjaz for the performance of a religious duty are subjects of His Majesty the King-Emperor of India, and as they suffer the greatest inconvenience and run the risk of loss of life and property they are much interested in the proposed Railway. The Government of India has always in view the protection and comfort of the Indian Muhammadans in their journey to the Hedjaz and therefore the Central Com mittee of the Hedjaz Railway Fund respectfully pray that His Excellency the Viceroy may be graciously pleased to become the patron of the fund and give them his support in their efforts.

In acknowledging the receipt of Mr. Holland's letter No. 2233-E. B., dated the 29th May 1906,1 have the honour to report that, so far as my present informa tion goes, the members of the Central Committee of the Hedjaz Railway Fund, if they exist at all, are persons of no importance. The only one of whom anything is known is the so-called Honorary Secretary, Mulla Ahdul Kayyum. This gentleman who was formerly Talukdar of the Lingsugur District, attracted attention in the year 1900 by his obstruction of plague operations and by ■writing exceedingly offensive letters. An enquiry was ordered into his conduct and the Minister, Sir Vikar-ul-ITmra, proposed to Sir David Barr that he should be severely repremanded and transferred to another district where he would be under more immediate supervision and that his promotion should be stopped for two years. Sir David Barr considered the punishment suggested to be wholly inadequate and expressed his opinion in the following reply :—“I do not wish to make any suggestion as to the punishment which Mulla Abdul Kayyum should receive, but I must remark that if an officer in the service of the Government of India holding an appointment of the same position and importance as that held by Mulla Abdul Kayyum, had written the documents which he has written and now has the temerity to defend, he would most assuredly have been sus pended from his appointment from the date on which his misconduct was brought to notice and on his admission of being the author of such false, malicious, insubordinate, and treacherous documents I have no hesitation in saying that the Government of India would have deemed it necessary in the interests of the public service to dispense with his services,^ Mulla Ahdul Kayyum appears to have been removed from the Nizam’s service, on receipt of this letter. He was reported in the following year to be collecting money for the Hedjaz Railway in the stations of the Hyderabad Contingent, and about the same time^ he, as “ Secretary of the Railway Subscription Committee, ” asked Sir David Barr to become patron of the Committee. Sir David Barr sent the letter containing this request to the Minister, whom he desired to Mulla Abdul Kayyum that, though sympathising with the desire ot the Muhammadan Community for Railway communication with the Hedjaz, he was unable to accept the office of Patron of a Committee formed in the capital of His Highness* Dominions. 3. l am not sufficiently aware of the present attitude of the Porte to say vdiether it is desirable to withhold a reply to the request which has been addressed to His Excellency the Viceroy. In view, however, of the fact that the possibility of hostilities between Great Britain and the Porte has unquestion ably exercised the Muhammadans of India to some extent, that there is a section of the Muhammadan Community which is inclined to regard the Sultan as the Khalifa of Islam, and that certain ill-disposed persons are appar- ently using the name of the Sultan as a means of exciting disaffection, I venture respectfully to advise that a reply be sent in the terms proposed in Mr. Holland s letter. It would be easy to misrepresent the omission of a reply as an act of intentional discourtesy due to a want of sympathy with a project, however unworkable, which is intended to facilitate an act of piety incumbent on orthodox Muslims, and, of those who hear of it as such, few, if any, will be aware that the body bearing the high-sounding appellation of the Central Committee of the Hedjaz Railway Fund consists only of a Secretary of indiffer ent character and, possibly, a few entirely insignificant persons. u No. 2848-E.

The first is a Confidential Report furnished me hy Mr. Th. Loiso. British Vice- Consul at Mersina, from information supplied to him by his son, Mr. M. Loiso, who has been employed as engineer on the construction of the line. This Report, to which a map and a list of all the stations between Damascus and Mudeyere are annexed, has been carefully revised by Mr. Lloyd, Honorary Attache to His Majesty’s Embassy, and compared with the information concerning the railway already in the possession of His Majesty’s Embassy. The second Report is the work of a German engineer, Herr Otto von Kapp Kohlstein, who was deputed by the High Commissioner of the Hedjaz Railway to inspect the Haiffa-Damascus branch and the complete section of the line from Damascus to Maan, as well as the extension from the latter place, now in course of construction as far as the 533rd kilom. south. This Report was published in English in the weekly edition of the “ Levant Herald.” I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. B. O’CONOR. ARABIA. CONEIDENTIAL. ■‘\20671] Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Report by Vice-Consul Loiso. THE accomplishment of a line of rail that should lead to Mecca has for a long time been the dream of every Moslem, and with this object steps were taken by his Excellency Izzet Pasha, Secretary and Adviser to His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, to devise and initiate a scheme which should link up by rail Damascus with the holy places. The decision to build the line was taken in 1900, and a High Commission was formed in Constantinople, with subordinate Commissions at Damascus, for the administration of the work, and in the same year the survey of the Damascus- Mezereib-Deraa section was begun by Turkish engineers. It was soon, however, evident that progress was being much retarded by the ignorance and lack of organi zation of the Turkish engineers, whereupon the Government, in spite of their original ambition that the railway should he entirely constructed hy Ottoman subjects, proceeded to engage European engineers, and to appoint Herr Meissner, a German engineer of considerable repute, as Chief Engineer and Director of Construction. On his appointment Herr Meissner took immediate steps with the High Commis sion to ensure the regular payment of good salaries to all the officials working under him, to he guaranteed by the Ottoman Bank; formed survey gangs composed of a mixed personnel of Turkish and European engineers, and naming the railway the “ Chemin de Per Hamidieh du Hedjaz,” attempted, hy actively pushing on the work and by various other methods, to arouse the interest and induce the largesse of rich Moslems in Syria and all over the Empire. The commencement of the line from Damascus had been originally thought of and discussed ; but owing to various political difficulties, as well as to the hope that the Erench line from Damascus to Mezerib could be bought up by the Hedjaz Railway Company, the idea was abandoned, and Herr Meissner centred his energies on the construction of the Mezerib—Deraa section, making use, for the transport of materials, rolling stock, &amp;c., of the Erench Damascus-Mezerib line. The Company were at this time in urgent need of funds, and for the sake of [2021 *—1] B,.{ : ? • , I 1 • i, economy, profited by the example of the Russians in their construction of the Siberian Railway in recruiting their labour from the army ; and camps of soldiers commanded by young officers were drafted in 1901 to positions between Mezerib and Deraa to undertake both the work of the “ terrassement ” and the laying of the line. For the first few months the soldiers worked well, but owing to lack of pay and other grievances, the work was seriously interrupted for some time, and a mutiny or^ strike was only prevented by the prompt action of his Excellency Kiazim Pasha, who? obtained redress for the troops. In the beginning of 1902 Herr Meissner, who had been pointing out to the Com mission the necessity of letting out to contract some portion of the work of the new sections, received instructions to call for tenders, and owing to the prospect of getting good prices, a considerable number of tenders from large railway contractors in Europe were received. The Administration de Chemins de Per Beiges also had an idea of taking up 300 or 400 kilom. of construction, and with that object sent out their engineers to inspect in May 1902, but being unable to come to a satisfactory working arrangement with the Commission, the idea was dropped. During the early part of 1902 the railway made rapid progress. Herr Meissner’s energy and administrative capacity were felt in every direction, and the soldiers, getting practised at laying the lines, were completing daily from 2 to 3 kilom. of line. At this time, too, further skilled labour was plentiful, as the men employed on the Rayak-Hama construction had just finished that section, and were drafted down to hurry on the Hedjaz Railway construction. Unfortunately, in the late spring, soon after the return of the Haj, cholera broke out amongst the soldiers and amongst the men employed in the works at Amman, the centre of the construction, which consequently had to be closed for seven months. During this time the Commission had come to an understanding with the Erench Company by the payment of an indemnity or compensation, and during 1903 the 230 kilom. of railway that separate Damascus and Deraa were being put into exploitation, and though the train service was most irregular, yet it managed to be of considerable assistance in the transport of railway materials, &amp;c., as far as Deraa. The line was now, however, getting too far south to be able to bear the heavy expense of freight for materials on the Beyrout-Damascus line, as well as that on from Damascus to Amman, and the idea of constructing a branch line from Deraa to Haiffa was being seriously considered. The Haiffa-Damascus Railway had been already surveyed and begun by an English Company, but as such it was of no use to the Hedjaz Commission, who, being embarrassed by the excessive rates charged by the French on their line from Beyrout, were determined to obtain an independent outlet to the sea for their traffic. The Concession bought from Mr. Arnold Hills, of the Syrian Ottoman Railway Company, for about 150,000/., by the Ottoman Government, was then handed over to the Hedjaz Commission, and the railway that is now being constructed (and is virtually completed) from Haiffa joins the main Hedjaz line at Deraa. The line from Haiffa to Deraa gave serious difficulties in construction, passing through mountainous country and through the \ alley of Yiarmouc. The first half of the line from Haiffa was intrusted to I urkish engineers under Moukhtar Bey, but the latter and more difficult piece from Lake Tiberias to Deraa was split up into three sections and let out to contract. During fifteen months 1,200,000 cubic metres of earth-works and 70,000 cubic metres of masonry were satisfactorily completed on these three sections, and in October 1905 the line was ready for exploitation, awaiting only the steel bridges for the Yiarmouc, over the delivery of which there had been some delay. Meanwhile the construction of the main line was going steadily ahead, in spite of the many difficulties that were met with through lack of water, heat, and the sometimes hostile attitude of Bedawi tribes; and in 1904 the line reached Maan, which had been marked down as the point from which the branch line to the Gulf of Akaba should start. During 1905 the station buildings, &amp;c., for the junction were built there, and a party of surveyors sent back to survey the construction of a small branch line between Es Salt and some spot on the main line between Zerka and Amman intended to facilitate the exploitation of the phosphate mines at Es Salt, but soon after the survey had begun the engineers were recalled and the construction of that branch indefinitely postponed. Pushing on southwards from Maan the line was completed as far as the Valley of Bactengoul by November of last year, and in January of this year reached Mudevere making a total of 572 kilom. of line constructed from Damascus.

Report on the Hedjaz Railway, by Herr von Kapp Kohlstein. ,. following Report was written by Herr Otto von Kapp Kohlstein, the distinguished engineer, Privy Councillor of His Majesty the German Emperor, and Inspector of the Hama-Aleppo Railway, in the Vilayet of Beyrout, as also of theLao-Kai-Yutansen line in China. It contains Herr von Kapp’s observations and appreciations during an inspection of the Hedjaz Hallway in November 1905 By request of his Excellency Kiazim Pasha, Director-General of the Hallway, and Herr Meissner, Chief Engineer, and by order of the High Commission of the Hediaz Hailway, and with the permission of his Excellency the Yah of Beyrout, I have inspected the Haiffa Hailway and the complete section (Damascus-Maan) of the ^ Hediaz Railway, as well as the extension now in course of construction to the 75th kilom. south of Maan—altogether 533 kilom. (The extension lately reached Mudevere, and 733 kilom. are now open to traffic, including the Haiua Since 1901, when the Imperial Irade was issued for the survey of the first part of the Hediaz Railway, the tracing of the line, the drawing up of the estimates and the detailed reports to be presented to the High Commission, I have directed my efforts to the execution of the Imperial Order. As Director of Railway Constructions m the Ottoman Empire, I have built 1,800 kilom. of railway since 1889, and having through my former experience thoroughly grasped the situation, I have arrived at an opinion highly favourable to the enterprise. Trusting that my observations regarding so important an undertaking as the Hedjaz Railway would be found useful, I thoug it it well to draw up the following Report and present it to the High Commission. Before so doing, a few remarks relative to the organization may not be out of place.— In conformity with the Imperial will, the intelligent measures taken by the High Commission at Constantinople, combining with the constant zeal of the Damascus Commission, and the extraordinary activity displayed by his Excellency Kiazim Pasha, Director-General of the Hedjaz Railway, and Herr Meissner, the work has followed a regular course. The zeal shown by the local Commission and the loyal effoits of his Excellency Nazim Pasha, the Yali, who is the President of the local Commission, deserve the highest praise. Moreover, the devoted efforts of the civil engineers and of the officers in command of the ^Imperial troops employed on the line afford a striking example of the administrative powers of his Excellency Riazim Pasha. I need not dwell upon the merits of Herr Meissner, Chief Engineer of the Hedjaz Railway. Throughout his technical career he has worked under my orders, and always gave the greatest satisfaction. His work on the Hedjaz Railway hears ample testimony to his abilities. Herr Meissner has been working incessantly for five years and is in need of a little rest, and I hope that the Railway Commission will take my suggestion into consideration and give him several months leave next spring, in order that he might recruit his health. Herr Schroder, who has also been under my orders for twelve years, and who has ably assisted Herr Meissner, is well qualified to replace him during his absence. Willi the exception of Damascus, Kademi Sherif, Deraa, and Maan, the stations are not yet provided with warehouses, &amp;c. Only stone lodgings for the workmen have been built, and these cover an area of from 6 metres to 16 metres, as on the German military railways. mi • ^ -c One of these buildings is intended for the use of the station-master. This type of building suffices for the needs of the line beyond Oman. There are twenty-seven stations over a length of 458 kilom. Those between Damascus and Deraa are separated by distances ranging from 7 kilom. to 21 kilom., and those between Deraa and Maan from 11 kilom. to 36 kilom. Springs exist at the following stations : Damascus, the head of the line ; Deraa, at kilom. i2 ; Zerca, at kilom. 203 ; Oman, at kilom. 222 ; El Hassa, at kilom. 378; Maan, at kilom. 458 ; and Mudevere, at kilom. 572. At present tank cars are used for the supply of water to the locomotives. As already stated in my Report of 1901, the scarcity of water can be remedied by sinking a well'at every 50 kilom. or 60 kilom. or by building covered cisterns. The delay in providing for the supply of water is due to everybody’s efforts being devoted to the advancement of the building operations, to the exclusion of other requirements. Thanks, however, to His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, this state of things will soon l 3 e remedied If the pools, which have existed for centuries, and which serve the nomads for watering their camels, are not covered in, they can only be of little use to the railway. As, however, these pools are shallow and very wide, and the cost of covering them would be enormous, it would be more advantageous to build new cisterns at every 6 kilom. to 7 kilom. The pools at Katran have a capacity of 36,000 cubic metres, and those of Djeize 70,000 cubic metres, but being open, the water evaporates very quickly and both remain dry for months.^ On the 6th November, 1905, the line nearly reached kilom. 572, the estimates having been made as far as the 710th kilom. . The earthworks were completed to kiiom. 590 by the 1st January, 1906, and it is to be expected that they will reach Tebouk, at kilom. 690, by September 1906. (Herr Kapp believes that Tebouk will be reached, but it is to be hoped that by then the line will come near Mudaini Salih.) The Haiffa Section. The idea of pushing the Hadjaz Railway as far as the sea, c.nd of finding for it an outlet, led to the repurchase of the Concession which had been previously granted. Believing that the railway would be extended from Museirib to Mufarek vi5, Bremta, Erbaid, and Ramit, I showed in my Report for 1901 how to -join it at Haiffa by way of Eremta, Erbaid, and Wady-Arab. In this way 165 kilom. would have been saved, i.e., 123 + 14 + 8, from Museirib to Mufarek, and 20 from Eremta to Beissan; moreover, Wady-Arab would thus have no more of a gradient than 25 millim. But the Haiffa line having followed the valley of the Yiarmouc, and crossed two rivers with a gradient of 20 millim., and at times curving 125 and 100 metres, the above-named scheme has no more practical importance. To cross the valley of the Yiarmouc two iron bridges were built, each of 50 metres, as well as several stone bridges, of four girders of a length of SO + 50 + 30 metres, and arches of 12 metres. Large sums of money were spent in the stone foundations of these bridges, and it was necessary to buy two locomobiles for the pumping operations. Eight tunnels of a length of 1,100 metres were built. Save for the last iron bridge, which will be mounted in the course of January, all the masonry and ironwork has been completed in the course of eighteen months. Between the 1st September, 1904, and 1st September, 1905, 65,000 cubic metres of stone work was built on the Haiffa section; on the Maan section, 30,000 cubic metres of stone work and 300,000 cubic metres of embankment were built. This suffices to show with what activity the work is being pushed on. In view of the nature and importance of the work, the Haiffa line was given over to contractors, who were fully paid up on the fulfilment of their engagements. The first part of the railway crosses the Plateau of Esdraelon, and is 60 kilom. long; the second crosses the valley of the Wady-ul-Sheria, as far as Lake Tiberius, and is 30 kilom. in length; the third follows the valley of the Yiarmouc for 60 kilom. with a gradient, and the fourth goes through the Sanjak of the Hauran. Although there is a pier at Haiffa for the accommodation of small craft, it is proposed to Wild a convenient quay of 690 metres, with a breakwater of 500 metres, at an estimated cost of 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 fr. Jeddah-Mecca Section. To build junctions between Eeraa and Haiffa, or Maan and Akaba, so as to connect the trunk line with the sea, enormous sums would be necessary, whereas there are no such difficulties in the way of connecting Mecca with its port in the Red Sea. According to Ahmed Moukhtar Bey, the engineer, such a line could be built with a gradient of 20 millim. and curves of 300 metres; its length would be 75 kilom. Eor every kilometre of this line there would be 5,000 cubic metres of embank ment, 100 cubic metres of masonry to build, and 1,000 cubic metres of ballast to carry. The embankments and ballasting could be done by two battalions of 500 men each within eight months; including the masonry, the line would cost 15,000 fr. per kilom., or in all 1,125,000 fr.; in addition to this, there are the following outlays:— [2021 s—l] 0Cost of the line .. General expenses for one year.. ., Two stone bridges and three reservoirs ., Initial outlay for the port of Djedda Railway material— Ballast, at 20,000 fr. per kilom. Four locomotives of 30 tons Fifty waggons of 15 tons, at 4,000 fr. Fifteen waggons, at 16,000 fr. . Total .. . Cost.

As I have said before, work on the main line would have reached kilom. 590 by the 1st January, 1906. As Damascus is 950 kilom. from Mudaini Salih, 1,400 kilom. from Medina, and 1,800 kilom. from Mecca, this will serve as a basis for the following notes:— . , . The works having started on January 1901, the date of Herr Meissner s arrival at Damascus, and having reached kilom. 590 of the trunk line and kilom. 160 of the Haiffa section—750 kilom. in all—by the 1st January, 1906, the yearly average works out at 150 kilom. Compared with other railway works, this result is satisfactory. In order to form an idea of the work done, I append a list of railways I have built in the Ottoman Empire over a length of 1,800 kilom.:— Name. Length. 1’eriod of Construction. Annual Average. Ismidt-Angora .. Kilom. 486 Years. 4 Kilom. 121 Salonica-Monastir . # • , 220 3 73 Sa’ionica-Dedeaghat . * 510 3 170 3 Alasb eh r-Afi un-Kara-Hi s s ar . . 252 'l 100 Raya k-Aleppo .. •• 332 133 Total .. •• 1,800 15 120 The construction of the first four lines on the above list was commenced in January 1899, and finished in twelve years, or an annual average of 144 kilom. This shows that the building of 150 kilom. yearly on the Hedjaz Railway is sufficient, and that the idea of building 200 kilom. in a year is contrary to the results hitherto obtained. According to the report of Moukhtar Bey, the Hedjaz line ivill meet|no great obstacles ; but as the line gets further away from Damascus and Haiffa, the works of construction will become more difficult, and the water supply will become a question of great importance. Wells will have to be sunk or springs found, as was the case north of Maan. Prom the above it may be inferred that the work yet to be done, beginning with January 1906, can be mapped out as follows :— Names of Section. Length in Period of Date of Kilometres. Construction.

It is very difficult to calculate the average expenditure per kilometre for the Damascus-Maan and Haiffa-Deraa lines, for part of the Haiffa section was over most '' I M t ■uneven ground, and necessitated supplementary outlay, and the average based on the total expenditure can never be quite correct. Rolling Stock. The rolling-stock at present owned by the Hedjaz Railway is the following : . Locomotives.-' Eleven Kraus locomotives with three axles, each of 30 tons and naving a capacity of 3^ cubic metres; nine locomotives with four axles each of 40 tons, and having a capacity of 12± cubic metres. Four “ B ” HohenzoUern locomotives. Waggons. There are a number of double-axle waggons on their way out, each of tons weight and able to carry 15 tons; fifteen third-class passenger-cars; one fiist-class passengei-car and a waggon moscjue, built at the Admiralty workshops. The Commission has, moreover, ordered six locomotives for passenger traffic, with a speed of 45 kilom., and thirteen Kraus locomotives for goods traffic. Thus the Hedjaz Railway owns foity-thiee locomotives, of which thirty-nine are of modern system, and 460 waggons, including 135 which were recently ordered. From statistics it is found that the line has so far cost 50,000 fr. ner kilom but i- i XT. _ • IP,., * * _ ^ (The Railway Commission has paid half the cost of the rations, and has occasionally paid for the cost of clothing for the troops. In addition to this, the soldiers and officers were paid 45 paras per cubic metre, and also received a gratuity for each kilom. built. All these expenses have been placed to the Construction Account.) These accounts may serve as a basis for calculating the cost of building for the remainder of the railway. At the beginning of 1906 there will remain 1,100 kilom. to be built before Mecca is reached, and this will cost 60,000,000 fr., at the rate of 50,000 fr. per kilom. It will be necessary to build 150 kilom. annually, and the sum of 7,500,000 fr. will be annually required for eight years to come. During the first five years the subscriptions for the line amounted to 17,500,000 fr., that is 3,500,000 fr. per annum. Further, the sale of the skins of sheep sacrificed at Bairam, and the Hedjaz Railway stamp produced 16,000,000 fr. in four years, or 4,000,000 fr. per annum. The annual income of the railway has been 7,500,000 fr., which amount, as stated above, represents the cost of the building of the line for one year. Some of the waggons mentioned above are partly covered in, and others are open trucks. As most of the transit for the first eight years will consist chiefly of railway material and grain, it will be necessary to buy several waggons of a capacity of 30 tons. As a matter of fact, if each axle has to support a weight of 60 tons, the net weight of a waggon will be 9,000 kilog., and it can naturally stand a weight of 30 tons. The cost of these waggons is not high in comparison with the others, and the expenses for repairs equal those of waggons of 15 tons capacity. It is true that the first lot of waggons ordered were not provided with the same system for coupling as those on the Beyrout-Damascus-Hauran line, but this defect was taken into consideration when the new waggons were ordered, and, moreover, those on the line are being daily replaced. Having heard that there was a divergence of views as to whether the head offices, factory, and repairing sheds should be built at Damascus, Deraa, or Haiffa, I thought it advisable to take this opportunity for giving my opinion on the subject. In view of the Yilayet, the Administration of the Beyrout-Damascus Railway, and the Damascus merchants, I propose that the offices be established at Damascus, as also the repairing sheds. (The Hedjaz Railway Board are of the same opinion, and the work of construction has started from this base, but the head offices are temporarily established at Haiffa.) For the factory and repairing sheds a covered area of 8,000 square metres will be required, and they will entail an expenditure of about 1,000,000 fr., including the cost of machinery. The climate at Haiffa is not good, and at Deraa there is no possibility of getting the provisions and clothing necessary for the workmen. this amount does not include the. expense incurred for the troops employed on the line. Damascus. of the fact that the manager of the line must be continually in touch with the officials' , Small repairing sheds, similar to those existing at Maan, Haiffa, and Deraa r should he established at Mudaini-Salih, at kilom. 950; Medina, kilom. 1,400; and Mecca, kilom. 1,800. Concluding Observations. To sum up, the Hedjaz Railway has been well built, and the work has progressed at the rate of 150 kilom. a-year, which may he said to he a satisfactory result. The High Commission, having guaranteed the necessary sums for purchases and the building operations, and measures having been taken for the works to advance at the rate of 150 kilom. a-year, the Hedjaz Railway, wdiich is one of the greatest works of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, will be completed in eight years. The Board of Management and of Works have succeeded in obtaining the best results. The work done by the Imperial troops has been highly satisfactory and beyond all criticism. But for their services it would have been impossible te have made such rapid progress. The completion of this great line will successfully crown one of the many works of His Imperial Majesty, our August Sovereign. Moukhtar Bey, who worked with me for six years, and who lately surveyed the line as far as Mecca, has not only shown technical ability of high order, but has now proved himself to be an efficient inspector. Several other engineers also accompanied me, and I can affirm that amongst the graduates of the Civil School of Engineers there are a number of young men who are well qualified for posts of assistant engineers, and even sectional chiefs. By acquiring practical knowledge they wall become first- rate engineers. The employment of troops on the line has greatly contributed towards the progress of the works. The contractors would have found workmen as far as Oman and Maan, but not beyond these places. As a matter of fact, it is thanks to the soldiers that the work on the line has so rapidly advanced, and, taking into consideration the fact that the salaries, clothing, and rations were paid by the Seraskierate, the expenditure is following a normal course. Generally speaking, the railway is worthy of all praise. The building operations have been carried out satisfactorily, and all the material used is of good quality. As the line crosses level country, bridges and tunnels are comparatively few. Beyond Oman, however, on the Airi-Zorka incline, a gradient of 20 millim. had to be adopted, curves of 100 metres built, a superficies of 3 kilom. filled in, bridges erected 20 metres high, with ten arches each of 12 metres span, in order to obtain a level over valleys 340, 951, and 610 metres broad. The work on this section of the line has entailed triple expense, as well as thrice the time of construction compared with the other sections. On the other side of Maan, too, there is a slope of 150 metres, called the Batn-Ghoul, and this required a gradient of 18 millim., curves of 100 metres, and the levelling of an area of 8 kilom. The earthworks were executed hy 400 soldiers, who also dug a cutting of 80,000 cubic metres within five months, which is likewise a brilliant achievement. Progress of the work depends on supplying food and water to the soldiers, engineers, masons, and the workmen employed on the works of levelling and construc tion. As it is difficult to transport these supplies by camel, the railway has to be used. A train service has been organized for this purpose at Maan. The line crosses several valleys which have had to be spanned by bridges ranging from 3 to 60 metres in length; but as there is a bed-rock at a slight depth serving for foundations, and there is little fear of floods to undermine them, the bridges could be built without inconvenience with an opening of 4'3 and 6*5 metres.IT. 111 . 8 .

I HAVE the honour to submit herewith my General Report for the last quarter. Besides the change of Vali and Mushir, which I have reported in my despatch No. 9 of to-day, I have to record that Riza Bey Es-Sulh, who had been Mutessarif of Kerak since the 4th December, 1905, changed positions on the 1st February with Fend Pasha, Mutessarif of Poli, in Kastamouni. It is thought generally that the removal of Riza Bey was due to his failure to provide supplies for the Akaba garrison. Mgr. Meletius, Greek Orthodox Patriarch, died on the 9th February. Mgr. Athana sius, Bishop of Homs, is acting as Patriarch pending the election of the successor of Mgr. Meletius. It is probable that Mgr. Athanasius will be elected to the see, as he enjoys the favour of the natives and active Russian support. He is a Russophile, who handed over the schools in his diocese to the Russian Palestine Society some eight years ago. The two candidates next in importance are Mgr. Gregorius, Bishop of Tripoli, who is also a Russophile, and Mgr. Gerasimus, Bishop of Beirut. The prospects for the grain and fruit crops are good. General trade is normal and without fresh developments. Trains are now running on the Hedjaz Railway as far as Mudevvera, which is about 570 kilom. from Damascus and 110 kilom. beyond Ma’an. From Mudevvera to Tebuk, a further distance of 127 kilom., the earthwork is nearly complete, but no rails have as yet been laid. Surveys have been made from Tebuk as far as Akhdar, which is about 70 kilom. from Tebuk, and 765 kilom. from Damascus. Trains have not yet begun to run regularly between Haifa and Damascus. The project of building a line from Amman to Salt has been abandoned, as the phosphate deposits at Salt had been over-estimated. If, however, the Hedjaz Railway Commission decides on building a branch to Jerusalem, this would probably pass through Salt. Work in connection with the Damascus electric tram, power, and light scheme has been confined to operations at the power station in the Anti-Lebanon, and to collecting materials. The rate of progress depends to a large extent on the attitude adopted by the new Vali with regard to the scheme. It is improbable that trams will be running in the next three months. With the departure of Nazim Pasha the scheme for bringing good water to the town has been dropped. It is to be hoped that the new Vali, Shukri Pasha, will give so necessary an improvement as much support as his predecessor. The Mecca pilgrims began to arrive here by train on the 31st ultimo.

Our readers are already aware of the praisewor thy religious zeal shown by the people of Islam in India in contributing to the Hidjaz Railv/ay which is one of the greatest of the pious works of His Imper ial Majesty. We have explained with gratitude in several past numbers that the people of Islam, in habitants of the above-mentioned vast region, knowing that their chief happiness in this world and the next depends upon His Imperial Majesty who has given such proof of his piety, owing to the strong moral attachment which binds them to His Imperial Majesty, and their own religious zeal, have in their millions set about collecting subscriptions for the Hidjaz Railv/ay. As we have read in the newspaper Semerat el Funouni Funoun received by yesterday^ post, many of the Indian notables who came to Medina for this year's pilgrimage approached the Cadi of Medina, from whom they obtained information regarding this railway, which stirred their pride to the uttermost, and learnt how far the Railway had extended up to the present time, and when it will be possible to finish it, and have now declared their intention of setting about the collection of important sub scriptions. The Cadi reported to the Palace the representations made to him by these Indian Musul- man notables, and in reply the second secretary of His Imperial Majesty Izzet Pasta despatched a tele gram in which it was stated that the Hidjaz Rail way had extended to a distance of four hundred and thirty kilometres from Damascus, which portion of the line was completed. Eighty-five kilometres of the Haiffa branch line was also completed, and the section of thirty kilometres to Ma'an had been entrusted to the contractors. It was natural that this sacred work would soon approach com- pletioncompletion in accordance with the terns of the Imperial Iraxie ordering the earlier completion of the line; and therefore action was being taken in conformity with the order. Five thousand soldiers had been added to those employed on the line, and under the Imperial auspices it had been decided that the line should reach Medina in two years, whence in one year it would be extended to Mecca. Any contri butions which were offered by Musulmans with a view to the fulfilment of the Imperial order and any proofs of generosity shown would procure their sure reward hereafter.opy 'lo .412.

Sir In accordance with your instructions I have the honour to submit herewith a few observations on the progress of the Kejaz Railway made during my recent visit to Amman, Deraa, Nezreeb and Damascus. Trains now run twice a week from Amman to Damas cus and vice-versa - a distance of two hundred and twenty four kilometres (224), which under existing ar rangements is covered in two days; and the line though not yet open to regular traffic is completed as far as El Hasa, one hundred and fifty six kilo metres further South. The organization of the line is still very defec tive and hours of departure and arrival of trains quite uncertain. For instance - at Amman I was told that the train for Damascus would start punctually nu 11 a.rn., but passengers sat in their places for two hours and a half before the train left the Station. The train consisted of two 3rd class carriages R. Drummond-Hay Esq., C.M.G., &amp;c ., &amp;c ., &amp;c ., His Majesty’s and Consul General in Syria.and a luggage van, and there were about fifty pas sengers - all natives. The carriages were without lamps and extremely dirty. I gather that the gen eral lack of organization is due to the fact of the administration being mixed - partly civilian and partly military. The line does not show evidence of being badly laid; but on the other hand the appearance of the country, generally.speaking, does not suggest any very considerable difficulty in the undertaking. The first of the enclosed photographs is of the via duct at .Annan, which is eighty (30) metres long and eighteen (13) metres high. A few hundred yards to the South of Amman the line passes through a tunnel one hundred and twenty (120) metres in length; but a senior Turkish official at Amman informed me that beyond this point the engineering difficulties to be contended with are trifling. The scarcity of water in certain districts and the hostility of the Arabs are in fact the most serious obstacles. Three quarters of the work so far accomplishedhas been done hy Italians, and the rest by Turkish soldiers of whom five battalions are at present dis tributed and variously employed on the two lines viz. Damascus-Hejaz and (the branch) Haifa-Deraa, The soldiers employed in preparing the line are paid at the rate of one piastre per metre (three piastres if over rock), and the Italians two and a half piastres (about 5d.) a metre over ordinary ground and twelve to fourteen (12-14) piastres over rock. The stations, with the single exception of Deraa, are little more than stopping places, and consist of a siding, a water-turret and a few tents. Leaving Amman at 1.30 p.m. I reached Deraa (one hundred and one kilometres) soon after sunset, and here the train stopped and one was obliged to find what accommodation one could for the night. This station is the only one of any structural pretensions so far erected. It ov/es its importance to the fact that it will be the junction of the main line with the branch from Haifa, by which all plant and material will in future be transported from the coast (insteadof by the French Beirut-Damascus line, as hitherto). / It is hoped that the Haifa-Deraa branch will be com pleted within the year; and - largely owing to dif of the Main Line and the Directors of the above- mentioned French Company - every effort is being made to hasten the work. It is said that the en gineering staff of the Hejaz Railway (including Herr Meissner and other Europeans) will shortly transfer their headquarters from Damascus to Deraa. owned oy an Italian contractor. The train left ared and twenty-three kilometres) was reached at ferences which have arisen between the Management Hov/ever, notwithstanding the prospective im- Deraa an hour before sunrise next morning - some lights, and, as far as I recollect, the same might almost be said of the station. Damascus (one hun- 1 P.m. i.e, in little over six hours. The entire journeyI journey, therefore, from Amman to Damascus - a dis tance of only two hundred and twenty four kilometres - occupies nearly twelve hours; and this is at present distributed over two days. The line follows more or less closely the Darb el Haj, and the country traversed, - whether corn-land or pasture, is monotonous to a degree - sometimes for hours hardly a town, village or tree being noticeable. Amman (the Ammon of the Old Testament - later known as Philadelphia, the southernmost city of the Decapolis) is now inhabited exclusively by Circassians and is one of three or four similar settlements in this district founded within the last half-century by emigrants who prefer Turkish to Russian rule. There are ruins here of great interest which include a very large theatre, Byzantine Church, fortress &amp;c. No doubt, if a good road were made to connect Jerusalem with Amman, a large proportion of the tour ists would avail themselves of the Hejaz hailway to get to Damascus; but, until this is done, an arduous two days* ride over the roughest of country will prove an■nrl an insurmountable barrier to the majority. Of the two thousand kilometres from Damascus to Mecca only three hundred and eighty are completed up to date viz. as far as El Hasen, though it is hoped that within six months the line will be in working order as far as Maan (sixty four kilometres further South). It is estimated that the entire line will be completed in about seven years. The time at present occupied by Pilgrims in going from Damascus to Mecca is about forty (40) days: so that the profits from this source alone will be con siderable and should allow a margin for a branch line for strategical purposes to Akaba or elsewhere. Such at least would seem to be the idea, though Turkish tradition in undertakings of the kind - to say nothing of the vested interests of powerful Seer InS 1 IRegister No. / &gt; i^y Minute Paper. 2 77J SECRET y^pARTMENT.

It differs in the following particulars from other projects for the line :— (a.) There appears to he no proposal for a branch line from Maan to Akaba. (b.) Difficulties with the Arab tribes on the section between Medina and Mecca se^m to have prompted the proposal of two alternative lines, one going direct from place to place and another for going farther westward touching the Red Sea coast at the port of Rabigh, from whence it leads direct to Mecca. (c.) A line is proposed from Jeddah to Mecca, which appears to be new, and which, if completed, will doubtless draw off much traffic from the main Damascus line. As regards the section from Medina to Rabigh, the usual port for this place is Yembo, and not Rabigh. Round the edge of the map is a profile of the route Damascus-Maan-Medina- Rabigh-Mecca-Jeddah, given as 1,830 kilom., and showing the various elevations above sea level.

O’Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received January 4, 1904.) Y (No. 851.) My Lord, Constantinople, December 29, 1903. WITH reference to my despatch No. 670 of the 16th October last, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Damascus, reporting on the progress in the construction of the Hejaz Railway. Your Lordship will observe that, according to Mr. Richards’ information, the project of a branch from Maan to Akaba has now been shelved, if not definitely abandoned, although it was at one time really entertained and an engineer had been deputed to survey the line of country between those two places. Mr. Richards calls attention to the statement in certain Turkish papers that Indian Moslems generally have already contributed 5,000,000 rupees to the Hejaz Railway fund, and that the Moslems of Hyderabad have offered to contribute a sum of about the same amount on condition that three-fifths of this sum shall be spent on the construction of a branch line between Jedda and Mount Arafat (near Mecca). In my despatch No. 654 of the 9th October last, I had the honour to transmit a newspaper extract reporting an offer by the Nyzam of Hyderabad of 5,000,000 rupees contributed by his Moslem subjects. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. II. O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. L Consul Richards to Sir N. O’Conor. (No. 91.) Sir, Damascas, December 15, 1903. WITH reference to Mr. Acting Consul Monahan's despatch No. 74 of the 7th October, 1 have the honour to report as follows concerning the progress in the construction of the Hejaz Railway. As already reported, the Damascus-Amman section of the line—a distance of 237 kilom. (148 miles)—is now open for traffic, there being five goods trains and two passenger trains there and back every week. 1 understand that the traffic receipts are steadily increasing, the lowest estimate of their total amount per month being £ T. 600, while persons, inclined perhaps to exaggerate, maintain that they now reach a sum of £ T. 2,000 per mensem. I think that one may safely put them at £ T. 1,000 a-month. On this section, there are four stations which are completely built, viz., at Deraa, Mezerib, Nessib, and Mafrak, while at three other points, viz., Khirbet-es-Semra, Zerka, and Amman the construction of the stations has nearly reached completion. Ballast, however, has not been laid over the whole distance. Beyond Amman, the rails have been laid as far as a place called Debaa, a distance of 66 kilom. (4miles). Beyond Debaa, the earthworks are completed for another 38 kilom. (^3f miles) to a spot known as Katraneh, and from there for another 70 kilom. (43f miles) to a place called Anazeh the construction of earthworks is now going on. The rails are at present being laid on the Debaa-Katraneh section, and it is understood that as soon as this latter place is reached, the operation may be continued without interruption to Anazeh, seeing that the earthworks will by that time have been completed up to that point. Erom here (Anazeh) to Maan—a distance of 57 kilom. (35J miles)—the task of constructing earthworks will very shortly be commenced, it, indeed, it has not already been begun. To resume, rails have been laid, and so, it may be said, the line is more or less completed over a distance of 303 kilom.—nearly 190 miles—while over a further distance of 108 kilom. (67J miles) the earthworks are more or less completed and the rails are being laid. On the whole, therefore, the progress with the work has been fairly satisfactory during the past year. In the future, however, it will be very much slower, because, owing [1804 d—lji'' 1 ! II to tlic fact that the Prench Company have refused to allow material for the construction of the line to he carried over their Beirut-Mezarib Pailway, except at most exorbitant and, it may be said, prohibitive rates, the Turkish Government have decided to press on the construction of the Deraa-Haifa branch of the line with all possible speed, so as to import their materials by that route. As a matter of fact, the work on the Deraa-Jordan Valley section of this line has already been begun, and it is calculate^ by Herr Meissner, the chief engineer, that the whole of this branch line will hr completed in from fourteen to sixteen months. As regards the much-talked-of branch from Maan to Akaba, I have reason to believe that, although at one time the project was really entertained—and indeed I know as a fact that one of the engineers had been told off to survey the line of country between these two places, with a view to the construction of the line it has now been shelved, if not definitely abandoned. As regards the prospects of completing this railway as far as Medina and Mecca, I am inclined to believe that they are much brighter than they were two years ago, when such a consummation was ridiculed even by persons who were in possession of information which enabled them to gauge more or less accurately the possibilities of the enterprise. In any case, if it is abandoned in two or three years time, when, at the present rate of progress, half of the line will have been constructed, it will not be, I venture to say, from lack of funds. This was the obstacle which all along has been most apprehended; but from information obtained in reliable quarters and from a consideration of the various fiscal sources, which are now being drawn upon with a view to the formation of a railway fund, there would appear to be every probability that the money will be forthcoming when required. The estimated cost of the enterprise is now put by Herr Meissner himself at 5,000,000/. at most, whereas at one time this sum was deemed by experts to be the minimum expenditure possible. In addition to the amount which has been subscribed throughout the Mohammedan world, and which has nearly reached a total of £T. 750,000, there are the following sources of revenue, most of which have been specially created for the purpose of the formation of this fund :— 1. A poll-tax of 5 piastres on every Moslem head of a family throughout the Empire. It has been calculated that this will yield at least £ T. 100,000 per annum. 2. A tax to be levied on a sliding scale on the recipients of all honorific distinctions, according to their importance. Seeing that the race for decorations is as keenly pursued now as ever it was, this is likely to prove a very fertile source of income. 3. Half the proceeds of the taxes on charcoal and wood, which are said to yield some £ T. 50,000 annually. 4. A tax, consisting of a 1-piastre stamp, which has to be affixed to all Petitions and other documents presented to the authorities. 5. A tax, consisting of stamps of different values, which have to be affixed to all documents connected with the hire of houses, contracts, leases, &amp;c. 6. A tax of 1 per 1,000 on the value of certain land and house property when sold, and the title-deeds obtained from the authorities of the “ Tapou ” Department. 7. Another tax, in the form of a 1-piastre stamp, to be affixed to the Ilm-ou-Khaber (official receipt) provided by the &lt;e Mouktar ” and members of every Parish Commission, to any person wishing to sell land or house property. 8. A further tax, being a certain percentage (not certain how much) on the value of land or house property when sold, and the provisional ‘ k Hodjeli,” or title- deed, is delivered. 9. The proceeds of the sale of the skins of all animals killed on the occasion of the Co urban Bairam. 16. Proceeds of the sale of fancy cigarette cases made of gelatine and sold by the Tobacco Begie agents for 20 paras each, in addition to the cost of cigarettes which ihcy contain. 11. The revenue obtained from the net receipts of that portion of the line which is already open for traffic, and which even now is, as stated above, put at £T. 1,000 (gross receipts) per month. There may be, and probably are, other sources of revenue of which I am ignorant. # . Your Excellency will understand that a large annual sum will be obtained by these means, and which may safely be put at £ T. 250,000, if it does not exceed that amount. Such a sum, obtained annually, will, undoubtedly, cover all the expenses of eon- r * II 1/ 3 ■ t struction, so that, whatever is obtained over and above that—by means of subscription—will be so much to the good, for the purchase of rolling-stock, &amp;.*. I may mention in this connection that, according to a statement contained in a recent issue of the Damascus paper “ Esh Sham ” (which itself is a quotation from the Constantinople paper “Sabah”), Indian Moslems generally have already contributed sum of 5,000,000 rupees (considerably over 300,000/.) towards the Hejaz Railway Tfund, while the Moslem inhabitants of the State of Haidarabad alone are said to have offered to tax themselves to the extent of 6J per cent, ol their total wealth, which it has been calculated would produce another 5,000,000 rupees, on condition that three- fifths of this sum should be spent on the construction of a branch line connecting Jeddah with Mount Arafat (near Mecca)—a distance of 60 miles—while the remaining two- fifths should he allocated to the general railway fund. I am of opinion, however, that these statements should be received with caution. In conclusion, 1 might mention a rumour which is gaining currency, and whien is to the effect that the Turkish Government, in order to induce the Trench Company to lower their freights for the carriage of Hejaz Hail way construction materials from Beiront to Mezarib, have offered them a kilometric guarantee, the amount of which, however, is not known. Your Excellency will understand that the Company-s grievance is that the Government have constructed, a railway parallel with their Hauran line, in diiect violation of a clause of the Agreement existing between the two Contracting Parties.

AS I had the honour to inform your Excellency by telegram yesterday, a somewhat serious conflict between Armenian revolutionaries and Turkish troops occurred near the Russian frontier on the 1st instant. The former, to the number of about eighty, sixty of whom were mounted, had crossed the frontier, to the south of the Kars road, into Passin on Wednesday night, which they spent at the village of Taihoja, about three hours from the frontier. Early on Thursday morning they proceeded, about one and a-half hours, to Yuzveren, where they found a small detachment of troops, who, with the patrols, &amp;c., who came to their assistance, numbered somewhat under 100 men. The Armenians divided into three parties and took up strong positions, and a fight ensued which lasted the whole day. Eventually the Armenians were dispersed, leaving a good many killed and wounded, the number not yet known. The troops lost a captain, a sergeant, and five or six soldiers killed ; and two officers and several privates wounded. News of the affair only reached Erzeroum on Thursday evening, the Armenians having cut the telegraph wires, so that Hassan Kale was the nearest available station. The \ ali at once sent two companies of infantry and a small detachment of cavalry to restore order, under Ahmed Abouk Pasha, a capable and enlightened officer; and it is thought that the Armenians who escaped have retired across the frontier, and that all fighting is at an end. The Yali informs me that he is confident that the incident is over. As usual, the first rumours of the affair reached Erzeroum in a very exaggerated form, and there was considerable excitement and alarm.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 68 of the 5th ultimo, I have the honour to report as follows :— There is now on the Hedjaz line a train from Damascus Amman (223 kilom.) and back three times a-week. This train is primarily for the conveyance of material for the construction of the line, but tickets are also issued to passengers. On the 5th instant, the Chief Engineer in charge of the construction, Herr Meissner, accompanied by three other engineers, left Damascus for Ma’an (about 460 kilom.) to set out the line beyond Ma’an, and persons likely to be well informed assert that he will go to Akaba, which would lend probability to the theory that the Ottoman Government intends to construct a branch from Ma’an to Akaba. Herr Meissner has also been given charge of the construction of the east of the Jordan section of the Haifa line with an additional monthly pay of 1,000 fr. The French Company has refused to carry any longer material from Beirut for the Hedjaz Railway at a reduced rate, whereas it has hitherto allowed a 55 per cent, reduction, and for this reason the Ottoman Government intends to push on the construction of the Haifa Railway as fast as possible.

I have, &amp;c. \ (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. B 2 [2182 x —2]Inclosure in No. 4. « Quarterly Report. THE summer months have passed with great tranquillity throughout the Vilayet of Erzeroum. Crimes of all sorts have been rare ; and, except during a few weeks, when thep fear of serious events in Sassoun caused considerable excitement and anxiety, the popula tion has been remarkably calm. In view of the serious difficulties of (he Ottoman Empire m European Turkey, and of the insurrection in Macedonia, this tranquillity is very striking. It is true that, at one moment, reports from Erzingian and the surrounding district were alarming; but inquiry showed that the stories circulated in legard to the situation there were unfounded or very much exaggerated ; and it appears that they were the result partly of the arrest of a number of foolish young Armenians who were in correspondence with the revolutionaries in Russia, and partly of intrigues to obtain the removal of the Mutessarif, who is unpopular with Mussulmans and Christians alike, owing to want of tact and roughness of manner, as far as I can understand, rather than to any actual mal-administration. i • ii Nazim Bev the Vali of Erzeroum, has undoubtedly gained much in authority and reputation during the past months. It is realized that, under a somewhat hesitating and verv quiet manner, he conceals a strong will and firm determination to maintain order; and I think that there can be no doubt of his desire to administer the province in a just and enlightened manner. He is without strong prejudices, and always willing to hear both sides of a question ; and, being a wealthy man, young, and with considerable influence at Constantinople, be is able to take his own line without fear. Moreover, he has, by tact and prudence, placed himself on a friendly footing with the Mushir, a most important condition if any Vali here hopes to carry out his views ot administration. The measures which he has adopted, with the concurrence of the Mushir, in regard to patrolling the Passin and Khiais districts, and so controlling the Kurds, have met with complete success ; and he has, to a considerable extent, limited the carrying of arms. As already stated, affaire in Sassoun were, for a time, very threatening; and the expectation of any serious trouble there gives rise to fears ot more extended disorders. Both Mussulmand and Christians remember that the massacres of 1895 had their immediate origin in the everts in Sassoun in 1894; and such memories are in themselves a source of danger in a country where panics are frequent and where a combination of nervousness and fanaticism forms the ruling spirit, fortunately, the design of the authorities to use the presence of a considerable number of revolutionaries who had been allowed to assemble in the mountains of Sassoun as a pretext for military iterations, with the assistance of the nomad Kurds, against the Armenians—with the probable object of removing them from their mountain strongholds once for all—was put a stop to by the representations of the Embassies. Orders have recently again been given to use military force against the revolutionaries in Sassoun, but not until the nomad tribes have left the mountains ; and, under these circumstances, even if these orders are carried out, it may be hoped that the operations will not entail serious excesses. The season for operations in the mountains is nearly over now, and winter, the great pacificator in these regions', is at hand. t .. r u- u Various bands of Armenians have crossed the frontier from Russia, some of which have been successful in reaching Sassoun, while others have been met and turned back. They show very little disposition to face opposition; and I fancy that many of their movements have been undertaken as an “ acquit de conscience,” the result of some sort of agreement between the Armenian Committees and those in Macedonia. The Russian authorities would appear to show but little energy in preventing them from entering Turkey. . . , Considerable discontent is evident at the heavy increase of taxation, the tax ot 10 piastres per head on horses and cattle falling very hard on the peasants. The harvest is very abundant; but the high cost of transport by road to the sea coast prevents any piofitable expoit of grain. (Signed! CHARLES S. HAMPSON. Erzeroum, September 30, 1903.Sir N.

It might well happen in the future that we should find it necessary to discourage subscriptions by British Indian subjects: such a course would be a powerful leverage in certain eventualities as for instance the continued illegal levying on British subjects in Turkey of the tax which is called the Hedjaz Railway Stamp.

Assuming this to be the case, Lieutenant-Colonel Maunsell*s sug gestion to include it in Egyptian territory by the arbitrary extension of the Egyptian boundary would not seem to be a practical solution of the question. (b) A branch line to the port of Akaba may be expected to increase the general value of the Hejaz railway, and therefore it is only natural that the connection 1connection should he contemplated. (c) With regard to the strategical conditions involved^ assuming that we possess sea command. Sir William Nicholson is unahle to see that the construc tion of the railway from Ma*an to Akaha would con fer on Turkey, or an ally of Turkey, any advantages of importance. He is inclined to concur in the opinion expressed in Sir N. O'Conor's despatch No. 485 of the 18th August last, that the Sultan's principal object in making the line would he to afford his Mos lem subjects greater facilities for their pilgrimage to the Holy Cities without passing through the Suez Canal. (d) On the other hand, as a line from Akaha to El Arish would he of no commercial value, the only apparent object in making it would he to enable Tur key to concentrate troops by land within striking distance of the Suez Canal and Lower Egypt; and as El Arish is stated to he within Egyptian territory, there seems no reason why the British Government should acquiesce in such a project.&lt;* 9 Foreign Office, Octoebr 28 1903, Sir % I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His , .K-^Ta Majesty’s Charge d 1 Affaires at Cairo,relative tc the the intention of the Turkish Government to construct a branch of the Hedjaz Railway from Ma’an to Akaba. / am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, The Under-Secretary of State, RECEIVED ^ 1 2 9 OCT. 1903 India QFFICeJCopy.

There seems no doubt that Akaba is now re garded as belonging to the Turks. , the issue of the Firman by which, in in confirmed the present Khedive in the 1 ct, Akaha, Howila, Diba^ and El Wej which till then had been held by Egypt. Accordingly on April 13th, 1392 the Egyptian Government otearner 11 Aida' took the garri son of the Fort at Akaba, consisting of 1 officer and 10 men, on board, and transferred them to a Fort which had been constructed for them at Honabi. At the some time two brass muzzle-loading guns with their an muni tion wore transported to lonahi. The latter place is situated just south of L.he 29th degree of North Lati tude on the Western shore of the Gulf of Akaba. Count Gleichen, late Director of the Egyptian Intelligence Department in a letter dated 2. 7. 1903 thus describes the Eastern frontier of Egypt in the Sinaitlc Penin sula . * A line from a point a little to the East of Hafeh on the Mediterranean Sea, running in a South East direction to Akaba (at the head of the Gulf of Akaba) but not including that town forms the eastern boundary for map purposes. No delimitation on the ground has yet taken place. From Akaba to the 22nd parallel the RedRed Sea littoral fomiB ulie boundary.' There ir&gt; no doubt whatever that El Arleh is well within Egyptian territory, A railway froia Ivla’an or Medain Salih^ i distance of 100 miles to Akaba would enable Turkish pilgrims and Turkish troops to reach the Red Sea ports without pass- in,; through ihe Suez Canal, and would thus save pay ment of the Canal dues. From the Egyptian point of view this might have some advantage as they would presumably have their own Quarantine .Station at Akaba,or elsewhere, and this would relieve the strain on the staff and resources of the Quarantine tat Ion at Tor. As regards the proposed lino from Akaba to El Arish or its neighbourhood, it would appear that its object must be strategical but considering the inhos pitable and unattractive character of the Sinai tic Peninsula, it is hard to Imagine that the Turks have any intention to encroach in that direction; the difficulties of marching troops through such a howling wilderness for an attack on Lower Egypt must alwaysbo enormous, and would be enhanced by both bases being exposed to naval attack. The solution of the question suggested by Colonel Maunsell, the extension of the Egyptian frontier so as to include Akaba, is certainly simple, but it savours of the sin of removing ones neighbour’s land mark, and 1 venture to think such a step unadvi sable.

O’Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—{Received August 24. ) (No. 485. Confidential.) My Lord, Therapia, August 18, 1903. WITH reference to my despatch No. 237 of the 5th May last, I have the honour to transmit to your Excellency herewith, copy of a despatch from the Acting British Vice-Consul at Haifa, relative to the progress of the Haifa-Damascus Railway, and the supposed strategical aims of the Hejaz line. With regard to the latter question, Mr. Abela reports a rumour that not only is the Hejaz Railway to be diverted to Akaba, but that a branch line is in contemplation from that place to El Arish, on the Mediterranean. I submitted this report to Colonel Maunsell for his opinion as to the supposed strategical value of the extension to Akaba of the Hejaz Railway, and inclose an interesting Memorandum, in which he deals with this point, and shows that while there may be some doubt whether Akaba belongs to Turkey or to Egypt, it is clear from Lord Cromer’s despatch No. 41, Confidential, of the 18th March, 1902 (Confidential print, Egypt, the 31st March, 1902, section 1), that El Arish is well within Egyptian territory. I learn from Mr. Monahan, that while still at Haifa, in the early part of this year, he heard from a Turkish Colonel of the staff that the Hejaz line would go to Akaba, and that this is confirmed by what he now hears at Damascus. On the other hand, he informs me that orders were received at Damascus in June last, to continue the survey from Ma‘an towards Medain Salih (also called El Hedjer on the maps, and somewhat less than two-thirds of the way from Ma f an to Medina). He considers it tolerably certain that the line will reach Ma c an in about a year. On the whole, there seems to be little doubt that a branch line from Ma‘an to Akaba is contemplated, which would enable Turkish pilgrims to travel to the Holy Cities without passing through the Suez Canal, even before the further extension of the Hejaz Railway, but I am inclined to think that the supposed strategical value, both of the main line and of this branch, is a secondary consideration, and that the Sultan’s real object is to mark his reign by affording his Moslem subjects greater facilities for their pilgrimage.

I HAVE the honour to state that on the 17th instant the Vali of Beyrout arrived in Haifa to inspect the affairs of the Haifa-Damascus Railway. The work on the line is still going on without interruption. I understand from Mr. Schumacher that Mr. Hills will protest against any infringe ment upon his rights to the gardens which the Turkish Government intends to make into a station. Dr. Schumacher recommends Mr. Hills to make his protest through the Foreign Office. , TT . I . , I understand also from Dr. Schumacher that the Hejaz line is^ a pure strategical one. He does not believe that the line will ever reach Mecca. It is only intended to reach “ Akabah.” He adds that efforts are now being made to. bring, before next September, the Damascus-Mecca line to “ Katrane,” and thence it* will be stretched to &lt;c Kallaat-el-Akabah.” Another line is also intended to be built from “ El-Arish ” to “ Akabah.” Dr. Schumacher says that instructions have been given to three German [2089 oa—3]engineers to study the intended line between “ El-Arish ” and “ Akaba/' and that the intended line between “ Katrane ” and “ Akabah ” has been already studied. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) P. ABELA. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. f 1 'Memorandum by Lieutenant-Colonel Maunsell. BEFERR1NG to the statement in Mr. Vice-Consul Abela’s despatch, No. 44 of the 20th June, that the Hejaz Railway is a purely stategical line, and only intended to be completed as far as Akaba, I would venture the following remarks :— From the point of view of British interests the construction of a railway con necting Syria with Akaba would not be of such strategical importance as might at first be supposed. It is true that by its means troops might be massed at Akaba for an attack on the Egyptian territory of the Sinai peninsula, or even for an advance through that country (by the Egyptian pilgrim route) on Lower Egypt itself. But the Port of Akaba would always be at the mercy of the British Fleet in the Red Sea, the country round it and the Sinai peninsula is extremely barren and ill- suited for supporting an army which would be dependent on Syria for its supplies, while the principal base at Akaba would always be subject to an attack by a British Fleet. But, notwithstanding this, the fact of a railway having reached Akaba would have a considerable effect in increasing Turkish influence in those districts, and might lead to interference in our sphere in the Sinaitic peninsula. A port at Akaba would permit of Turkish troops being embarked thence for Red Sea ports, Hejaz and Yemen, avoiding the Suez Canal and saving the canal dues paid in passing through. In Lord Cromer’s letter No. 41, of the 18th March, 1902, the terminal point of the Egyptian frontier in this direction is mentioned as Akaba, but it is not clearly stated whether this includes the old fort and village of Akaba. If this is not already done the simplest solution of the question would be to extend the frontier line so as to include Akaba in Egyptian territory. The Turks do not appear to have any Mudir or Government in the place. As regards the proposed line from El Arish to Akaba, it is quite clear from the letter of Lord Cromer’s quoted above that El Arish is well within Egyptian territory, as the frontier post of the Rafeh, definitely marked by pillars, is some distance along the coast to the north-east of it. As stated in that letter the true frontier of Egypt was regarded as the route Rafeh- el-Wejh-El Mueilah Naki Akaba-Akaba, but for the moment it was not intended to extend authority further than the line Rafeh-El Gurieh-El Makdaba-Makdaba- Jebel-el-Helal-El Munbat-Akaba. In either case the trace of the proposed line would enter Egyptian territory near El Arish, and probably for most of its length (its exact trace is' not given). It is difficult to see what commercial value such a line would be to anyone, as the country is almost barren and produces little. There is no port at El Arish, and it would be practically impossible to make one on such an open coast, and apparently there would be no connection with any other proposed line through El Arish. The proposal to survey a route from El Arish to Akaba may possibly be an attempt on the part of the Turks to raise the question of the exact frontier with Egypt at that point. From the military point of view, when Akaba is connected by rail with Syria branch to El Arish would be strategically of some value to the Turks, as by it troops could be massed at Akaba and El Arish, from both of which points routes of invasion lead towards Egypt, but, as stated above, the Akaba route could be attacked by a fleet in the Gulf of Akaba, while that through El Arish would similarly be open to naval action in the Mediterranean.

It was announced, a few weeks ago, that the Sultan was inviting all the Moslem inhabitants of the Empire to contribute the sum of 5 piastres a head to wards the cost of the construction of the Hedjaz Railway. Letters were received from Constantinople | to the effect that Egypt - as an integral part of His ^ Mapesty*s Dominions - should not be behindhand in showing zeal in such a cause.

As this would be, on every ground, most undesirable, I suggested to Moustapha Fehmi Pasha who cordially agreed, that an official warning should be issued, which, whilst couched in such terms as could give no offence at Constantinople, should make it perfectly clear that the movement was entirely unofficial and that all contributions must be purely spontaneous.

In spite of the troubles in Macedonia, and of the absolute lack of money, the Government is nevertheless, pushing the Haifa and Heiiaz Railwav line with remarkable energy. They have now laid 15 kilom. ot rails and have at Haifa a stock of about 30 more kilom. of rails and sleepers, a huge mass of hydraulic cement, twenty-six large and some twenty small tip-waggons, freight car^for permanent way, and for 'Thursday next the “ Levante Lime” has announced to their agent here that they should prepare for the lighterage of ^ ne '' (German) locomotives.

They cannot sufficiently describe the wild energy displayed there. The rails are sometimes only laid on the bare soil, the wadies are crossed^ by bridging them with sleepers, and now they reached a point near Habaa near Zlat-I-Belka, east of the Bead Sea.

R. O’CONOR. [2321 h —3]‘2 Inclosure in No. 2 . Damascus, November 19, 1902. Consul Richards to Sir N. O'Conoi (No 98. Confidential.) I HAVE been somewhat struck lately by the growing tendency to call m question the utility of the construction of the Hedjaz Bailway, except on the supposi tion that it is being made exclusively for strategical and political purposes, the possibility of an attack on the holy cities of Islam, and the necessity for the dispatch of large bodies of troops to their relief, being, logically and arguably^ the only justification for so gigantic and costly an undertaking. I understand that in certain military circles it is more or less openly insinuated that England is the only Power which may, with justice and a show of probability, be suspected of harbouring designs, to'frustrate which, it is said, this railway is now being made! In support of this argument attention is called to the well-known fact that the jMahommedan subjects of His Britannic Majesty are five or six times as numerous as those of the Sultan; to the recent action of His Majesty’s Government with reference to Koweit; to the Aden territory boundary dispute, the nature of which is not clearly understood here, and finally, to the large number of Indian pilgrims who go yearly to Mecca and Medina and the existence of a very large resident Indian colony in the former city itself. It is pointed out that the Sultan would rather lose all the rest (fi his Empire put together than forfeit his right to the guardianship of the holy cities on which his claim to the title of Commander of the Eaithful (Emir-el-Mumenin)—(so held, though erroneouslv, by the general public) largely depends. These' considerations, or at least some of them, are trite and commonplace enough in the European press, but I was not aware till lately that they were appreciated and discussed in certain official and military circles here.

My Lord, Constantinople, November 13, 1902. I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a copy of a despatch received from His Majesty’s Consul at Damascus respecting the progress of the con struction of the Hedjaz Railway. An extract from the “ Levant Herald ” on the same subject is also inclosed. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R,. O’CONOR. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Richards to Sir N. O’Conor. (No. 92.) Sir, Damascus, November 4, 1902. I HAVE the honour to report as follows concerning the progress made in the con struction of the Hedjaz Railway, taking it section by section. From Mezerib to the 4th kiiom. the line has now been completed in every respect. From the 4th kiiom. to the 13th kiiom. (Dera’a), a second layer of ballast is required to make that part of the line also complete. From the 13th to the 30th kiiom. again the line is completed. From the 30th to the 70th kiiom., another layer of ballast is all that is required to render that part of the line complete; the sleepers and rails being already laid in this, as in the previously-mentioned 4th-13th kiiom. section. From the 70th to the 94th kiiom. there are twenty small bridges, so called, but the great majority of them are merely culverts, still to be made before this part of the line can be described as finished. From the 94th to the 114th kiiom. the earthworks have been completed, and the sleepers and rails temporarily laid, though no ballast has been put down as yet. This is the extent of the work achieved on that, the principal, part of the line. The stations on this more or less completed section of the line will be at Mezerib, Dera’a (13th kiiom.), Nessib (27th kiiom.), Mafrak (52nd kiiom.), Khirbet-es-Samra (75tb kiiom.), Zerka (94th kiiom.), and Amman (114th kiiom.), of which Nessib, Mafrak, and Khirbet-es-Samra represent merely names given to certain spots, there being no villages or even hamlets in those localities ; while even at Zerka, the actual village of that name is a long way from the line. At Amman, however, there is a village of considerable size, while Dera’a may almost he described as a small township. Only one of these stations, viz., that at Dera’a, is being seriously taken in hand, two-thirds of that structure being now completed, while the rest are represented merely by what are known as “ maisons d’equipe,” even some of these being only half-built. At Mafrak a large water-tank has been constructed; while the old Roman reservoir situated in the same place has been put into good repair, and so rendered serviceable, its capacity being estimated at 4,000 cubic metres. In addition to this main section work is being carried on, on the Damascus-Dera’a part of the whole line, 5 kiiom. from Dera’a backwards in the direction of Damascus being already completed. The work has been done entirely by two battalions of soldiers, who appear to have performed the task allotted them expeditiously and well. They are now making the earthworks from the 5th kiiom. onwards (or rather backwards) towards Damascus. Reckoning from this end 64 kiiom. of earthworks and ballast have been completed from Kadem (the Damascus terminus) to the village of Deir AH, it now only remains to lay the rails. Seeing that the whole distance from this city to Dera’a is 123 kiiom., there are only 59 kiiom still to be made. As reported in a previous despatch 4,200 soldiers (five battalions) are supposed to be working on the line, though owing to sickness, of which there is a great deal, desertion, [2259 aa —1]2 and other causes, 1 am informed that not much more than 3,300 men are actually engaged in work. In addition to their rations these men are, or should be, paid at the rate of 1 piastre for every cubic metre of work done, which those who should know inform me is not very generous pay. But even this pittance is not always forthcoming, and there is a good deal of discontent in their ranks in consequence. I am informed that so far about £ T. 120,000 have been spent here, a sum which represents money paid to the contractors, the salaries of engineers, assistant engineers and foremen of works, as well as the pay of the troops employed. A considerable portion of the Mushir Kyazim Pasha’s salary, viz., £ T. 150 per mensem, has also been paid out of this fund, the remainder of his pay, viz., £ T. 200 per mensem, being sent direct from Constantinople. It would appear that this functionary has made himself very unpopular of late by evincing a constantly increasing tendency to interfere with the engineers in matters of detail of which, of course, he is profoundly ignorant, and so an amount of friction has come into play which threatens to have the most serious consequences, not the least of which is the possibility of the resignation of Herr Meissner, the Chief Engineer himself, at the expiration of his two years’ contract, which will, as a matter of fact, take effect very shortly. It is earnestly hoped, h&amp;wever, that he will not be compelled to take so regrettable a decision. In addition to the £ T. 120,000 mentioned above as having been spent here, it may be calculated that another £ T. 170,000 to £ T. 180,000 have been expended at Constan tinople (on rails, sleepers, hydraulic lime, a certain amount of rolling-stock, including four locomotives, &amp;c.), making in all the considerable total of £ T. 300,000. If we take it for granted, as we are informed by the Press, that some £ T. 500,000 have been subscribed altogether, it will be seen that three-fifths of this total have already been spent, in return for which about 180 kilom. of railway, more or less completed, represent the work accom plished. This works out at £ T. 1,660 per kilom., or, in other words, at a little less than £T. 2,410 per mile, which, judged by European standards, is decidedly cheap, though it must be remembered that the labour employed is comparatively cheap, especially that of the troops, that the country to be traversed presents very few engineering difficulties, and that the stations on the section of the line (more or less) completed have still to be built. Then, again, on the asset side must be placed a very large quantity of rails and sleepers already bought and landed at Beyrout, which are calculated as sufficient for another 40 kilom. of line. Moreover, the initial expenses in a large undertaking like this are a very serious item, a fact w hich should also be borne in mind. The result as a whole, therefore, may be considered as not altogether unsatisfactory. I might mention in conclusion that Kyazim Pasha, consumed by a very creditable and intelligible desire to make the line as cheaply as possible, and encouraged very probably by the contemplation of the results obtained from the employment of troops on the construc tion of the line, proposed at a recent meeting of the Railway Commission that the Redifs of this Army Corps should be called out and employed entirely on the works, to the exclusion of the contractors and the men, foreigners and natives, employed by them. This proposition, which received the approbation of the other members of the Commission, with the important exceptions of the Vali and Herr Meissner, the chief engineer, was referred to Constantinople, where, however, I hear, it has not been adopted. The Vali informs me that the line will be taken as far as Amman within a few weeks, to a place called Katraneh in nine months from now', and to Ma’an within eighteen months. This, however, may be looked upon more in the light of a ({ pious opinion.” I have, &amp;c. (Signed) W. S. RICHARDS. P.S.—1 find that I have not explained that the Damascus-Dera’a section of the line does not pass through Mezerib, though that station is at present connected by rail with Dera’a. The reason of this is that when the construction of the line was commenced it was considered probable that the existing French line would be bought by the Turkish Government, but now that negotiations to bring about that result have practically ceased, it has been decided to take the new line straight to Dera’a without touching at Mezerib. i I might add that I hear that Herr Meissner has received telegraphic instructions to go and study the proposed line between Dera’a and Haifa, whither two battalions of troops are to be sent shortly to commence the construction of this railway. I have not, however, had time yet to verify the truth of this report. W. S. R.il * Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Extract from the “Levant Herald” of November 10, 1902. The Hedjaz Railway. —The “ Sabah ” is informed that the measures ordered by the Sovereign in view of hastening the works of the Hedjaz Railway will result in their completion as far as Maan by the 1st September in next year, which will be the twenty- seventh anniversary of His Majesty’s accession to the Throne. The distance between Mezerib and Maan is 800 kilom., or one-third of the entire length of the line. On this point being reached by the above date the average annual record of work executed since the beginning will be 200 kilom., which average, says our contemporary, is highly creditable considering that this essentially Islamic undertaking is carried on by Turkish engineers with Turkish money.

Tonnant, Directeur of the Beyrout-Damascus-Hauran Railway, M. Shaoul, the Maronite Christian Manager of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, Damascus branch, and Mussulman Notables, among whom were two Delegates from Cyprus, were taken by train from Damascus to ’ Ain Zerka, a place on the Hedjaz line 92 Idiom, distant from Mezerib, or 192 kilom. from Damascus. There travelled by the same train from Damascus to ’Ain Zerka about 100 Mussulmen, who were given return tickets at the cheap rate of 2J medjidiehs each. At ’Ain Zerka there was a banquet on the evening of the 31st, and on the 1st instant, the anniversary of the; Sultan’s Accession, an inaugural sacrifice, with prayers and speeches. The party returned by rail to Damascus on the 1st instant. The line is, I understand, not yet quite finished to ’Amman, about 8 kilom. beyond ’Ain Zerka. No trains for the public are yet running on the line. The “ Suria,” the Turkish-Arabie official Gazette of the vilayet, of the 4th instant, published on the 7th instant, contains in each language over five columns about this inauguration of the railway, and promises to give more on the same subject in its folio win number. It gives the text of telegrams to Constantinople from the Yah an d from Razim Pasha, Superintendent of the Hedjaz Railway Construction, and of a congratulatory and complimentary reply to the Yali from Ahmet Izzet Pasha, the Sultan’s Second Secretary.

I am also given to understand that three locomotives are already in use on that section of the line. Quite recently the staff of engineers employed on the construction of this railway has been increased by the arrival of eighteen freshly-engaged engineers, four of whom are “Chefs de Section,” and the remainder Cf Sous-Chefs,” so that the whole number of men so employed on this enterprise amounts now to thirty-five. The progress of the work has undoubtedly been slow hitherto; but it is hoped that now the engineering staff has received such a considerable addition to its numbers, there will he a perceptible improvement in the rapidity of construction. The Chief Engineer, Herr Meissner, in addition to natural abilities of a high order and profes sional attainments, which are evidently much above the average, is an energetic and keen workman, and, while he does not spare himself, he is not at all disposed, to judge by what one hears, to allow anything like malingering in those who are under his orders. His subordinates appear, on the whole, to be capable men of a good stamp, so that, provided the necessary funds are forthcoming when wanted, and that all the reasonable demands of Herr Meissner and the contractors are complied with by the authorities, I see no reason why good progress should not he made with the work in the course of the next year or two.

T n Q VA Sbo (Signed) ’ N. R, O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul Hussain to Sir N. O’Conor. (No. 3.) Sir, Jeddah, January 9, 1902. I HAVE the honour to report that his Highness the Grand Sherif and his Excellency the Vali of Hedjaz left for Mecca on Wednesday morning, the 8th instant. As far as it is known, the Grand Sherif had come down here under orders from Constantinople to arrange the matters with the Bedouins to allow the telegraph line to pass to Medina unmolested. The Sheikhs of the tribes through whose country the line passes have been called and subsidized, and the work has been started energetically. In several interviews with the Grand Sherif, his Highness has given assurances to me and other foreign Consuls that he will bring water to Jeddah from a large spring about 25 miles from here which he has been cleaning and enlarging for the last six years, and that he has already written to Constantinople and requisitioned iron pipes for the purpose. He asserted that when this spring will be connected with Jeddah by means of iron pipes it will give a permanent and sufficient supply of potable water to the town during all times, and will place it out of danger of scarcity of water for ever. His Highness also expressed his keen desire to begin the railway work from Jeddah to Mecca and thence to Medina, and said that as the line between Jeddah and Mecca can be finished within twelve months, it will be well paying owing to the pilgrim traffic and ibe trade that exist between the two towns, and the surplus after working expenses might be utilized to construct the line between Mecca and Medina. On the other hand, if the railway was to be made from the side of Damascus, it would not pay till it reaches Mecca and Jeddah, and so the work will be retarded very much tor want of funds. His Highness said that he had requested His Imperial Majesty the Sultan to order the work to be commenced from Jeddah, and in case it was not considered possible to allow to start the work on his own account and expenses, which he was ready to do at once. His Highness also expressed his belief that, if the railway was started from Jeddah, the large number of pilgrims coming annually will derive the benefit of the line at once, and will be willing to subscribe more freely for the railway, and on their return to their countries will induce their countrymen also to subscribe, which will surely augment the funds much and more quickly than at present. The views of the Grand Sherif in this respect appear very plausible if they ever seethe light of realization.

I HAVE the honour to submit herewith to your Excellency a few details of information recently obtained on the subject of the construction of the Hejaz Railway. The work on the greater part of the Damascus-Mezerib section of the line is practically at a standstill owing to the still pending negotiations for the purchase by the Ottoman Government of the existing “French” Hauran line. I hear that the Company have reduced their demands from 8,000,000 fr. to 5,000,000 fr.! but that the Govern ment is still holding out in the hope that a still further reduction may ultimately be obtained. It is confidently anticipated that the sellers will come down to 4,000,000 fr., and it is even whispered that they may be “ beaten down ” to 3,500,000 fr.! Beyond Mezerib, for the first 39 kilom., the line is being made by the troops (3,000 officers and men), while another 61 kilom. are being constructed by regular workmen supplied by contract. The soldiers are doing much better work now than formerly, because they are being paid by the “ piece.” Whereas, at first, they were paid by the day. Now every soldier receives 1 piastre (“Good money,” i.e., the mejidie at 19 piastres) for every cubic metre of earthwork made, whereas formerly he was paid at the rate of 1 piastre per diem. The result of this change of tactics is that whereas under the old arrangement a soldier never exceeded his cubic metre of work done in the day, it was not unfrequently only J a cubic meter. Now the same man will accomplish 3 and some times even 4 cubic metres of earthwork in the same time. The extra pay is, of course, a great inducement to the men to do their very best. The consequence is the work is making much more rapid progress than was the case a few months ago. At the same time it is more than doubtful how far it is good economy to employ troops on such work, even when they are doing their very utmost as at present. A foreign workman—say, Italian, of whom a great many are being employed on the line—will do twice the amount of work in the same time, and will do it better. He is better paid, it is true, but in the end rapidity and efficiency make the best possible combination. As regards the officers, they, up to the rank of Captain, are receiving 10 paras for every cubic metre of earthwork made by the men under their orders. As regards the higher grades, I understand that they are getting 12,000 piastres for every 15,000 cubic metres of earthworks completed. They have also the right to claim their transference elsewhere with promotion after two years’ service on the railway works. The men too gain this advantage, viz., that three years’ service in railway making count as four, as is the case with those serving in the Hejaz and Yemen. Altogether 100 kilom. of the line (exclusive of the Damascus-Mezerib section) are actually being constructed ; another 85 kilom. have been surveyed and staked out, while some 45 kilom. more have been studied with a view to a regular survey. The work is divided up into seven sections, nominally, but in reality there are only four on which work is actually being done : each of these (four) sections is being made by contract. [1849 c—3]2 Fifteen engineers in all, including Herr Meisner, the chief engineer, are now employed (there were originally seventeen, hut two have resigned), all but five of whom are foreigners of various nationalities. I understand that their chief grievance is that their numbers are insufficient, it being calculated that there should be at least three if not four engineers for every section of line under construction, consisting of some 30 Idiom, (some more and some less), whereas under existing circumstances, if all the sections were being made at once there would be only two engineers for every such section. As a matter of fact, however, each of the four sections of the line actually being made is being “ engineered ” by one chief engineer and two £ *' sous-chefs.” I should state that two of their number who are Moslems and both of whom are oddly enough, named Mukhtar Bey, have been ordered to accompany the Haj to Mecca with a view to their making a preliminary study of the country from the 270th Idiom, right on to Mecca itself. It is hoped that the line will be completed (not of course open for traffic) as far as Ain Zerka, a distance of 100 kilom. from Mezerib (62J miles) on the 29th August next, being the anniversary of the Sultan’s Accession. I understand that the two most difficult parts of the line will be from Mezerib to Ma’an, chiefly on account of the absence of water, and from Medina to Mecca owingto the natural (topographical) obstacles that will be encountered. I am assured that the line ought not to cost more than £ T. 4,000,000, ie., at an average rate of £ T. 2,000 per kilom., the whole distance of the line, according to present calculations, beino* 2,000 kilom., say, 1,250 miles. My informant asserts that everything is included in this computation, viz., all necessary buildings and rolling-stock, but that would seem almost incredible. He does not maintain, however, that the undertaking, if it is ever completed, will only cost that sum, because, as is invariably the case, where Turkish public works (or line’ else^ are concerned, the “ leakao-e ” nnfnrtnnntfOv 1 Cl n /'WTYl /Alln r* Vfc indeed anything else) are altogether incalculable. leakage, unfortunately, is enormous and I have, &amp;c.

The members of the local Commission, the ulemas and the sheikhs, the notables and others proceeded, by special train on Friday evening, to Muzerib, where nearly all the population of the Hauran had gathered. The train from Damascus reached Muzerib at sunset. The Mufti of Damascus, and after him the other ulemas and sheikhs, said prayers for the preservation of the precious life of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, all present shouting, “ May God guard His Imperial Majesty ! ” [2281 r—1][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 6 of the 26th January, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that it would appear that a certain amount of progress has been made at Mezerib with the construction of the Mecca Railway since the appointment of Shems-ed-din Bey to the command of the Construction Corps in place of Ali Pasha,, who has been recalled. I hear that some 3 kilom. of earthworks have been completed, and that whereas hitherto three soldiers only succeeded in making 1 cubic metre of road per diem, each man is now doing a cubic metre and a-quarter of work in that time. I understand that the newly-appointed engineers, MM. Meissner and Labella— the former of whom, I might mention, receives 100 Napoleons per month, and the latter 75 Napoleons—are men of capacity and energy, and it is hoped that hence forth the progress of the work will be very much more rapid than it has been in the past.

O’Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received February 4.) {No. 38 .) My Lord, Constantinople, January 29, 1901. WITH reference to my despatch No. 352 of the 1 0 th October last, 1 have the honour to report that the “ Levant Herald ” of the 24 th gives the following statements, which are taken from a letter published in a Syrian newspaper, the “ Semerat,” at Funan, respecting the proposed Mecca Railway :— At a meeting held at the residence of the Nawab Berk Dzink Mohim Ben Salikeh Kadi, at Hyderabad, which was attended by a number of Ulemas, Seids, and journalists, the Nawab read out a letter addressed by the Ottoman Ambassador in London to the British Government, asking for authority to open a subscription for the above railway. He followed this bv reading the reply of the Government acceding to the request. . ^ 8 i r 5 l am somewhat sceptical about the alleged correspondence between Costaki Pasha and His Majesty’s Government, and I am not prepared to say at present that any subscriptions raised in India for the construction of the railway will not be mis appropriated. From local sources I learn that the sums actually encashed, amounting to some 130 , 000 /., and lodged at the Ottoman Bank, have been transferred to the Banque Agricole, a purely Turkish institution, under the control of the Minister of Mines and Forests. 1 also understand that an order for 10,000 tons of rails, at the price of 156 fr. per ton, has been placed with the Belgian firm of Cockerell. I have the honour also to transmit an extract from a despatch of His Majesty’s Consul at Damascus, reporting on the slow progress of the work actually under taken. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Consul Richards to Sir N. O'Conor. (No. 3 .) (Extract.) Damascus, January 7, 1901. 1 HE railway construction works, on the other hand, are progressing so slowly that it is even permissible to doubt whether any real progress can be made at all. The fact that four, not five, as first reported, out of the six engineers engaged in this enterprise, have been summarily dismissed, and that although some 30 kilometres, say 19 miles, have been surveyed, the work has been so slovenly done that it will have to be done over again, would certainly appear to warrant this assertion.
