After Compliments, I beg to inform your honour that about my case against Thomas and the Couneil of Ministers of SgSg the Sultan. I explained to you yerbally that they dismissed d me from the post of the Secretary to the Couneil ( where I was appointe by orders of H.H. the Sultanj and ordered that I should be imprisoned in fort for 7 days. The delay has been caused on account of the Wazir haying gone to Baghdad. I informed you in my first letter about the order issued by the Wazir Thomas and the Council to cut Rs 100/ from my pay fixed by H.H. for my monthly maintenance. After my address to you I receiyed a useless reply from them. With great regret I say that this cut of Rs 100/ has been yery acute on me. &amp; I have nothing to to feed myself and my family. All the Muscat ^ people know it. It put me at the mercy of my friend’s help. I say, your honour and the ^reat ^oyt neyer like that a noble Of person should be insulted to this extent. I am son^a Sultan and A brother of a Sultan. I request you to help me in this matter as the case is serious and I fear that family may die* I say that the British G 0 yt is guardian to the G 0 yt of A1 Saeed and if I have - committed any offence towards the my uoyt which makes me liable to my dismissal from my post, and cutting of my pay and to destroy my respectability by imprisonment, they should show it to you and I at the orders of the ftpct High G 0 yt f if it is proyed against me as they say. I am at a loss to understand. I hay© submitted a letter to the Political Resident in the &lt;*ulf as informed you.You may know it. I request you Am kindly to reply me quickly.tj * v.j \ From All Din ^aisal, Muscat. ’ / J ( 5 ) To The Hon*Die the Lt.Colonel L.B.II.Haworth, H.B.M's Political Resident, Persian Gulf and Consul General for Pars, etc. Dated 27th oeptemher 1927, received 5th October 1927. A. C. I most humbly beg to state that Mr. Thomas, the financial Adviser, is always interfering in our affairs which have noth ing to do with him. My brother, H.E. the Sultan of Muscat, appointed me as a Secretary to the Council of his Ministers 3 dm but he (Mr. Thomas) dismissed me from service on account of a dispute which occurred between me and a tailor although appointments have nothing to do with disputes. I was unjustly forced to pay Hs.225 and I agreed to pay same in order to put an end to the trouble. Mr. Thomas was not satisfied with this and inflicted seven days imprisonment on me and deducted Rs.100 (from my pay). He had also deducted (from my pay) Rs.100 on a previous occasion without any reason and now I have to pay Rs.200. I am getting Rs.300 only by which I have to support my family consisting of a wife, son and a servant. Moreover I am indebted to some merchants, your suojects, which I have to pay by instalments. Mr. Thomas has put me in a difficult position and I do not know what I am to do. If they do not want me to live in the tov/n while H.H. the Sultan is absent I will leave the place as I cannot tolerate such an oppression. When I went to receive my pay for the month of ^ugust I told the accountant not to deduct tto * the instalments due to the creditors as my daughter had died and I had incurred considerable expenses for her funeral and mourning festivals as it is usual among Arabs but the Accountant did not agree as he was in favour of the merchants he insisted in cutting off a part of my pay. We had some conversation over the matter and he complained to Mr. Thomas who inflicted the abovementioned punishment upon me in order to please his employee without giving any consideration to my pespect. As Mr. Thomas is a Government representative and he always spoils our dues and does not pay attention to our representa tions and a free born man cannot tolerate oppression adid2 insult and I see that they are acting according to own accord, I heg to state that our affairs concern H.H. the sultan who is not present and request you to order him not to interfere in affairs which do not concern him. I informed the Consul that he intended to attack me in my 1 house and told him that if an undesirable action he taken by hls soldlers 1 was obliged to oppose them. On the same day when he wanted to accompany Said to Baghdad his instructions about my imprisonment and deduction of pay were communicated to me but I did not agree. If the Government have ins tructed him to do so please let me know what God forbid the Government never agree to such a thing. Now he is in Baghdad. Please give this matter your best consideration before an unpleasant action is taken by either of the parties.
