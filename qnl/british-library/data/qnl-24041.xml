He (perhaps naturally) j was enthusiastic about the idee and promised that if the propose! reached the Government of India he would do all he could to assist. He thought that it would be possible to get a first-class mechine to do what I proposed for something under £ 10,000, and thought that the upkeep, salaries, petrol, etc. might entail an expenditure of somewhere between £ 3000-5000 a year.

Copt to: P.A.BahrainTo Sir LIoutenant•Colonel Gordon I^oofc, C.I.is, t Political Agent, Bahrain# The Hon•hie the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf. to'* V /ft &amp;- X A \ In the fourth paragraph of my letter ho# B-i dated the 20th Ootoher 1935 I wrote that I would address you separately on the subject of providing the Political Agent and Assistant Politioal Agent, Bahrain with better means of carrying out their tours and 1 now Leva the honour to recomsicmd that the Politioal ^gent should be provided with an aeroplane to be stationed at Bahrain and manned and maintained by the Loyal Air Force. i*&gt; 2* Some means of speedy travel should be at the sole disposal of the Politioal Agent# Both the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in ‘Iraq, and the Senior haval Officer, Persian Gulf Bivision, have been most courteous in affording facilities for touring by air and by sea, but their aircraft and sloops have their own duties to perform and cannot always be had at a moment's notice, and in particular' cannot be kept waiting on events# It often happens in Arab business that it proves better tactics at the last moment to postpone(p'' postpone a visit or on the other hancl to prolong it indefinitely, hut this cannot easily or courteously he done when an aircraft or sloop has haen specially placed at the Political Agent's disposal for certain dates and may he needed elsewhere* Touring hy mail steamer is a slow business and useless on most occasions as the steamers only call once a fortnight on the Trucial Coast and then only at Sharjah or Dihai* Imperial Airways only call at Charjah and cannot nowadays he relied upon to have a seat available on board for the political Agent himself and certainly not s6L.ua for his staff as well. V-ith the pressure of afisirs which exists in the rersian O-ulf today, speed in getting about is of i enl importance, i 3. If I may venture an observation which would he outside my sphere as Political Agent, were it not for its vital hearing on Qatar and the Trucial Coast of which 1 an in infernal charge, I would say that these consider ations are of even more pressing importance in the case of the Political Resident# In the past the Political hesiaent had at his disposal a despatch vessel, the B.I.Ia.S Lawrence. Hq was independent of other means of travel, could move about the Gulf freely and remain where he wished unhampered in time or place by the limits of the mail service or by the calls of the normal duties of his Majesty's Ships and Aircraft. The Political Lesident came among the Shaikhs in dignified and unhurried circumstances, and became known to them and they to him to an extent which is not now possible. This was part ofof the secret of the immense hold that Sir iercy Cox had land his name lias to this day) over the Arab Coast* The 'I^wrence', as signifying the Political ^©sidentf was j herself an influence in the Gulf and I can from personal experience hear regretful witness to her value as a symbol and to the grievous loss which her withdrawal has occasioned in administrative efficiency, dignity and comfort* Today, when touring in a sloop the Political itesldent has tne use of a single cabin ^only a share of a cabin in the older type) with a small writing table, but there is no accommodation for his staff, no oabln where they can mess and no place where cyphering and g secret work can suitably be done, and work is carried on in circumstances of the utmost difficulty and discomfort* During a tour of the Truoial Coast which I have just completed as officiating Political Kesident, my staff have had to live and work in a canvas shelter on the deok, close beside the Somali ratings* mess, and on some days the wind has made work impracticable. In winter even this arrangement would be impossible. Great difficulties are also experienced on the mail steamers, and arrivals and departures by them are most undignified* A public arrival is out of the question* Times are changing and I believe that a return of the dignity and comfort of life and of the prestige of the appointment and an even higher degree of , administrative efficiency Iwithout the great cost of a despatch vessel) might be attained by the use of a special aeroplane and by arranging for suitable accommodation at the headquarters of the three main Trucial ohaikhdomsthe various existing and projected landing grounds and flying boat anchorages are marked# I would suggest arranging for accommodation at Qatar, Abu Dhahi, Sharjeh and P*as al Khaimah# 3* At this point I would emphasise the saving of time that is possible by using aircraft especially because the distances by sea often entail waste of time V owing to the difficulty ox* approaching places at night and owing to the tides. On a recent tour Bahrein to Has al Khaiaah took fortynine hours, whereas by aeroplane it would have been perhaps six hours# Has al Khaimah to Sharjah six hours as against one hour# i am not qualified to offer suy opinion on the technical questions involved in the choice of an aeroplane and venture to suggest that the Koyal Air Force should be consulted about the most suitable type of aircraft and about the best way of arranging for its housing and upkeep at Bahrain# In view, however, of the wider development of landing grounds than of anchorages and the possible occasional use of the aeroplane away from the sea, I would suggest that a land machine should be provided. There will be long flights over sea and uninhabited desert and the aeroplane should, therefore, be fitted with three or four engines in order as far as possible to avoid forced landings. A range of about 450 miles without refuelling is required and in view of the strong winds experienced in1 the Persian Gulf a cruising speed of 140 miles an hour is desirable. 6. Ky requirements of the aeroplane are as follows (i) a separate cabin for two officers, and a third officer in emergency! lii) a separate cabin for an Interpreter and one clerk, and sitting space screened off for two menials, (iii) special attention to be paid to is feight, very roughly, say:- Luggage — 350 lbs. Files and Office equipment Stores and water 200 200 / Iv) / silence and ventilation in the cabins, I * \ * llv; reasonable space for personal luggage (exclusive of crew), files and Office equipment, stores and reserve of water '750 'lbs. in case of forced landing in the desert,, wireless apparatus suitable for taking in and transmitting telegrams both en route and when the aeroplane is on the ground, suitable lavatory accommodation, (vii) a small refrigerator, and (viii)plenishings to be quite plain and suited to heat and glare. 7. In view of the rapidity with which Qiatar and the Trucial Coast is being opened up, I attach great importance to the provision of an aeroplane to enable the Political Agent to move freely and quickly l vi)V quickly about aub hope tb&amp;l you will faal able to support the proposal. 1 have the honour to bd» Sir, lour most obodiont Servant, Political Agentf Bahrain*■ \ a ' \ i October 20, 1935* My dear -b’owle, With reference to my letter No. B-3 dated the 20th Ootoher 1935 regarding the provision of an aeroplane for the use of the Political Agent, Bahrain, I write to say that I recently met Mr. Bymms, Director General of Civil Aviation in India. I consulted him regarding my proposal and he (perhaps naturally in view of his appointment) was enthusiastic about it. He said that he thought that a suitable aeroplane fulfilling my requirements might be had for something under £ 10,000/- and that the annual upkeep might be something between £ 3000 and £ 5000. He agreed that in local circumstances the best plan would be for the Boyal Air Force to carry out the manning and maintenance. I explained to him that as I was •acting 1 , I should put my proposal up to you as Political Kesident and that I did not know what view you would take of it. He, however, promised that if the proposal went forward to the Government of India, he would do his best to help us when the matter v&lt;as referred to him. 2. I an told that a De Havilland •Rapide* or the D.H. 86 Express Air Liner might meet our requirements. Yours sincerely, The Hoti'Dle Lt-Colonel T.C.

Please refer to your letter No.B-3, dated the 20th October 1935. 2. I am not forwarding your proposal to Government as I am afraid that there is little chance of its going through at present. 3. If and when a land Squadron of the Royal Air Force is based at Bahrain it might be possible to get an aeroplane of a suitable pattern which would be looked after and manned by fcbrac Royal Air Force personnel, for the use of the Resident • • and the Political Agent. The latter would then have a machine entirely at his disposal without having to face the difficult problems of personnel and maintenance. The Royal Air Force, for their part, would doubtless be glad to have an extra machine, paid for and maintained from our budget, which could be used for service purposes if the necessity arose. . i ' c ' Lieut.-Colonel Gordon Loch,C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. i *• ,' *.

Loch, Political Agent, BAHRAIN Dear Colonel Loch, 6th* December, 1935* REGISTERED I have now heard from Colonel Burchall on the problem or/political Agents private aerial carriage for use in the Persian Gulf* Since our talks you will recall that one of our big flying boats, *Sylvanus M has unhappily been destroyed by fire* This has caused us to utilise two of our three-engined Calcutta: flying boats to replace it on the run across the Mediterranean. We have two other Calcutta flying boats which are, however, in England being employed in training new flying boat pilots for the Big Scheme in 1937. Colonal Burchall says that he cannot at present see any possibility of releasing any of these flying boats to undertake a charter to you as we had hoped* I did touch upon the possibility of our using a smaller three-engined monoplane of a type known as the *Avro X', but I find this is also likely to be placed into almost continuous service, and in any case would hardly meet the load require ments that you need. It therefore seems that we should return to the original idea of our servicing and flying an aircraft which would be purchased and owned by the Political Agent himself. By now, however,(5) IMPERIAL AIRWAYS LIMITED. CONTINUED NO. 2 BCHC/lG.172d. 6th, December, L935.
