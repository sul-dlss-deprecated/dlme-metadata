Subject:- Amendment of the Aden Dettlernent Regulation, 1900. With reference to your letter No.5d76, dated the 22nd September 1934, I am directed to convey the following observations on the draft of the amending Regulation supplied by the Chairman, Aden Settlement. (a) The proposed amendment of Section 17(1) merely provides power to make bye-laws as to the grant of contributions to provident funds. Specific provision, it is considered, should be contained in the Regulation on the lines of Sections 3 and 9 for empowering the Executive Committee to create providient iunds and spend Aden Settlement Fund money for that purpose instead of leaving this power to be inferred from the fact that Section 17 gives power to make bye-laws regarding contri butions to such funds. (b) The words 'prescribed rates'* in the draft appear to refer to possible rules made under Section 13, although the expression is vague, and would in any case have to be altered to the formula contained in Sections 11 a( 2) and (3) and 12(2). ( c) A re-draft of the whole amending Regulation is enclosed. On comparing the wording of the proposed Section 9A in the re-iruft, with the wru wording of Sections 8 and 9 , it will be observed that the latter two sections contain no reference to rules. It is not improbable that the Chief Commissioner, might desire to make rules providing for powers to be exercised by the Executive Committee in respect of provident funds; but in case there is no such intention, or such a desire is not probable, the words 'rules or' might be omitted from Section 9A in the re-draft. &lt; | (d)(d) Attention ia invited to the following point »hich emergea clearly from the re-draft. The purpoee of the Chairman'a proposed amendment of Section 17 ie to authorise the Executive Committee to contribute to the provident fund of the present Chairman. It ie eunaieed that this provident fund ie not 'a provident fund established by the Executive Committee*, but probably a fund already in existence and established by the Aden Port Frust or by Government. If the latter is the case, then neither the original draft nor the re-draft really includes it, for it ie neither established by the Executive Committee nor established with ite approval by on officer or aervant; and in order that it may bo lawful for that Body to contri bute to the fund, some ouch words as the following might be added to the new Section W, namely;- •or to any provident fund to which any officer or aervant in its employ contributes'. 2 . I am accordingly to re^uefct that the points raised in this latter may kindly be examined and the ra-draft returned after making such corrections a* ray be necessary.Copy of « letter No.l45b, dated Aden, the 1st Larch 153*), from the Chief Commiaaloner, Aden, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Forei^ and Political Department, New Delhi.
