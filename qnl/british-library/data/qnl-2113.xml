In the Press, on the platform and in the Legislatures the White Paper has been subjected to most unfavourable criticism. The main points on which the attack has been concentrated have been the extent of the special powers conferred upon the Governor General and the Governors ; the retention in the hands of the .Secretary of State of control of the All-India Services and of recruitment for the Indian Civil Service and Indian Police : the financial restrictions, in particular the long list of non-votable items of expenditure, the appointment of a Financial Adviser by the Governor General, and finally the proposal to establish a Railway Roard by the Constitution Act. Doubts have also been expressed about the date of the inauguration of the Federal constitution which is represented as being hedged in by impossible conditions. 2. That the constitutional proposals have been condemned by all classes of politically minded Indians might be held to indicate that a constitution based on them might have little chance of success, but it must be remembered that the Indian Press and the nationalist politicians tend at all times to indulge in destruc tive criticism of any constitutional proposals emanating from Government, as approval might be construed as unpatriotic. The attacks have been intensified in the present instance by a desire to neutralise the views of extreme conservative opinion in England, and the belief that the louder the criticism, the greater the possibility of improving the bargain. Little attention has been devoted to the very important franchise proposals. Few have sought to argue that the scheme as a whole is not based on the decision of the Round Table Conference. 3. To estimate the reception of the White Paper it is necessary to look below the surface, and an attempt is made in this appreciation to estimate the views of some of the chief political parties and groups in India. 4. The attitude of Congress towards the White Paper might be held to be Indicated by one of the resolutions said to have been moved at the abortive Congress session recently held in Calcutta to which reference is made below. This was to the effect that “ Congress holds that no constitution framed by the British Govern ment while it is engaged on a campaign of repression deliberately initiated against the national spirit can be worthy of consideration by or acceptable to the people of India ”. Though this uncompromising attitude represents no doubt the official view of the Congress^ beneath the surface, there are indications of a growing feeling in favour of abandoning unconstitutional methods and of utilizing the power which the new constitution will offer. In spite of the abstention of the Congress the process of constitution-making goes on, and the new constitution is rapidly approaching. These facts are not lost on the right wing of the Cong ress. In this connection it is interesting that Mr. Rangaswami lyenger, a right wing Congress man who, though he has never supported the civil disobe dience movement, is yet a close friend of Mr. Gandhi, has accepted an invi tation to the Joint Select Committee, though he had refused to attend the third Round Table Conference. 5. The Liberals have generally concentrated their attack on the points already mentioned, but they have been careful to ignore the suggestion made by Congress supporters that the scheme should be rejected in toto and that they should refuse to co-operate in further constitutional discussion. They will devote themselves to a concerted effort to secure the removal of what they regard as the more objec tionable features, but even if this is not successful, it appears probable that many hold the view recently enunciated by the President of the Liberal Federation that &lt;£ even a poor constitution may work and yield results if a strong and united party in the country with its roots among the masses is bent upon extracting from it the utmost that it will yield.” 6. The All-India Muslim Conference has criticised the scheme on the con ventional lines and, in particular, advocated curtailment of the powers of Govern ors, the grant of more seats to Mulsims, the effective representation of the * Muslims in the public services and the Indianisation of the Army in a fixed time.V 2 Many Muslims speakers, however, in the provincial Councils and in the Assembly, though repeating these criticisms, have, at the same time, admitted the necessity ** of “ safeguards ” under present conditions. 7. The reception of the proposals in British India is thus not unexpected ; no one is satisfied, but few are prepared to reject a scheme which is recognized as a great advance and which is capable of improvement. Some mention must be made of the attitude of the Princes as expressed at the recent session of the Chamber. In general it may be said that they favoured Federation with adequate safeguards ; they were prepared to authorise their representatives to carry on further negotiations in London in order to secure these, and reserved their final opinion till full details of the scheme were known. Op- , position, however, was voiced by the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar, whose sudden and tragic death is a loss to India, and by some of the Kathiawar States. 8. The 47th annual session of Congress was staged to take place in Calcutta on March 31st and April 1st. Both in Calcutta and Bengal itself it excited little attention ; from other provinces a comparatively small number of delegates endeavoured to attend, some of them were prevented by Local Governments from leaving their province, others including Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Mr. Aney, the President, were detained as soon as they reached Bengal. According to the Congress figures only about 1,200 filtered through to Calcutta, of whom the greater number came from Bengal itself (300) the United Provinces (600) and Bihar (200), none of the more distant provinces sent more than 30. Some of these dele gates were arrested before the date of the session and on April 1st, some 800 persons tried to hold the Session in a central place in Calcutta. Attempts were made to read the resolutions and copies of these resolutions and of the speech which Malaviya intended to deliver in support of them were distributed. These resolutions reiterated and endorsed the Independence and Civil Disobedience resolutions passed at previous sessions and included also the resolution rejecting unread the White Paper, to which reference has already been made. The delegates were without difficulty arrested or dispersed; no demonstrations were made in support of them and no further attempts to hold the Session were made. The majority of those who had been arrested were released shortly afterwards ; Malaviya was set free on April 2nd, and proceeded to Calcutta where his arrival was unnoticed. 9. The session may thus be said to have proved a complete fiasco ; and though lull credit must be given to the Government of Bengal and other Governments for the effective action taken, the result shows clearly how Congress methods and policy have lost their hold on the country. 10. Apart from this, Congress activity has been almost negligible during the last month. It was reported that attempts would be made to hold provincial Congress meetings but so far no such attempt has been made. 11. A brief reference must be made to the further proceedings of the Legislative Assembly during the Session which lasted from the beginning of February till Easter. The Assembly has on the whole supported the policy of Government both in political and financial matters. A motion criticising Government’s policy in preventing the Congress Session was defeated. The resolution advocating the * release of Gandhi and other political prisoners was talked out, as those who sup ported it were apprehensive of forcing it to a division. On the financial side no important cuts were made in the Budget Estimates, and the Finance Bill was passed with only one minor modification, the reduction of the rates of income-tax on the lowest paid assessees ; motions to exempt these assessees entirely and to reduce the rates of postage were rejected. Other Bills of some importance which were passed without serious opposition included a Bill to make incomes derived from foreign securities and brought into India liable to Indian Income-tax and a Bill to empower Government to take action to prevent dumping. Of private Members’ Bills, the last appreciation referred to the Temple Entry Bill which as anticipated, made no further progress. The reformers appears to have lost something of their initial enthusiasm, while orthodox feeling has been strongly consolidated against the measure. A motion to circulate a Bill to exempt Muslims from the Child Marriage Restraint Act, which was passed with much enthusiasm a few years ago, was only rejected by a very small majority of which a large part consisted of the Government vote. There are signs that public opinion is growing against interference by the Legislature in matters which fall within the domain of religion.

Following appreciation is for Dominions and is fifth of 1933 :— 1. The outstanding event since the last appreciation is the fast undertaken by Mr. Gandhi for 4 ‘ reasons ”, as he has stated, 44 wholly unconnected with Government and connected solely with the Harijan movement ”. On receipt of this announcement Government decided that he should be unconditionally released as soon as the fast began. It had been sedulously put about for some months past that Mr. Gandhi had lost all interest in civil disobedience and that his whole mind was devoted to untouchability. In a statement he had himself issued from jail he had made it plain that for others at any rate it was desirable to make a choice between untouchability work and civil disobedience. His fast therefore and the declaration that accompanied it might well be regarded as an indication that he intended to devote his life to untouchability. In these circumstances it seemed clear that the wisest course was to take Mr. Gandhi’s action at its face value and to release him on grounds of humanity connected with a non-political issue. Any other course indeed would have been most difficult to justify to public opinion. Mr.' Gandhi, however, within a few hours of his release took up the political issue and published a statement dealing at length with civil disobedience. The announcement of the fast had puzzled all classes in India, for the motive seemed hardly to justify such drastic action, though it was true that his campaign against untouchability was not making satisfactory progress owing to the growing opposition of the orthodox and lack of support of many Congress workers. Reflection however brings an increasing belief that the motive of the fast was mainly to secure his re-entry into the political field. There is good reason to believe that he was fully aware of the growing split in the Congress, that he realised that certain leaders were contemplating a meeting at which a new policy possibly involving abandoning the movement would be advanced, if not adopted, and that he was anxious to make an attempt to reunite the various groups and thereby restore, if possible, the prestige of Congress, recover his own position, and enter into negotiations with Government. His ° statement reasserted his belief in civil disobedience and contained suggestions for improving the movement if it were to be continued. There should, however, be a temporary suspension of the movement because civil resisters would be 44 in a state of terrible suspense during the three weeks’ fast ”. all Government were asked to take advantage of this suspension and release civil disobedience prisoners unconditionally and withdraw the Ordinances. Mr Gandhi, if he survived the fast, would tender advice to Congress leaders and to Government ; if no understanding was arrived at as a result of his effort Government could revive Ordinance rule, but if there is the will on the Dart of Government, he had no doubt that a modus opei and/i could be found. Civil disobedience, however, could not be withdrawn so long as many civil resisters were in jail and no settlement could be arrived at without leadeis, such as Patel, Nehru and Abdul Ghaffar Khan. This statement has of course been represented in Nationalist quarters as a bona fide attempt to create peaceful conditions, and.the action of Government in promptly countering it by reiterating their policy that ^ere could be no release of civil disobedience prisoners unless they were satisfied that civil disobedience had been abandoned has been challenged as a of a oeace offer. These commentators ignore the lesson of 1931. Ihey also ignore the fact that the suggested bargain is one-sided ; Congress merely suspend a movement which they are finding it increasingly difficult to continue mdXr ^resent conditions, but which could more easily be revived if leaders, such as Jawahir Lai Nehru and more particularly Abdul Ghaffar Khan were released unconditionally and if their position were thereby restored. There is no indication and no probability that any real co-operation would follow such release Government had no alternative but to reassert _ their position and thereby prevent the confidence of their supporters being seriously shaken by the impression gaining ground that they were prepared to negotiate with Congress,even though the latter did not abandon its unlawful activities. The action taken by Government has proved very reassuring to its supporters. One significant point in connection with the fast must be mentioned ; it appears to have created far less general interest than the fast of September last. It is also significant that from two quarters Mr. Ghndhi’s action has been criticised ; on the one side Subhas Bose and Patel in Europe have rejected his leadership and advocate a radical reorganization of the Congress programme but this attitude does not appear to have received much support in India ; on the other side Maulana Shaukat Ali and others regard his action as a definite embarrassment to the real peacemakers. Apart from this there has been no political incident of importance during the last month. The campaign against terrorism in Bengal continues to make satisfactory progress, and a report just received from Chittagong shows that two important absconders were killed in a fight with the police and two more were arrested. There are now signs that in consequence of the firm policy adopted by the Government of Bengal, Government officers are getting more support and assistance from the general public. Bengal has been free from terrorist assassination for relatively quite a long time, but terrorist gangs are still active and every week reports of serious dacoities are received. In Madras also—a province hitherto singularly free from this form of crime, some absconders from Northern India committed a daring- robbery on a bank in Ootacamund ; one of the offenders died as a result of a bomb explosion in Madras and the others have been arrested. The arrival of the India delegates in London marks the beginning of what it is hoped will be the last stage in the constitutional discussions. The Burma Council, though given ample opportunity for coming to a decision on the question of federation, has again failed to do so, and the recent session has been completely infructuous, except as showing the political incapacity of the present Council.

Following appreciation is for Dominions and is sixth of 1933 :— 1. The view expressed in the last appreciation that Mr. Gandhi’s dramatic fast created less general interest than the fast of September is confirmed by subsequent reports. From Madras it is reported that it aroused practically no interest outside Congress circles. Even in the districts of Bombay it is said to have generally fallen fiat, while in Bengal, though the progress and termi nation of the fast attracted some interest, it caused no excitement, apparently because its relationship to practical politics was obscure. Similar reports have been received from other provinces. In the North-West Frontier Province, there was some feeling that Mr. Gandhi’s motive was the political absorption of the untouchables by the Hindu community, and that he had procured his release in order to carry on what from this point of view is regarded as an anti- Muslim campaign. 2. Since the suspension of civil disobedience Congress workers generally have been endeavouring to keep in the public eye by devoting themselves to the Harijan movement, but in Bombay the uplift work is said to have received little impetus, while in provinces such as the United Provinces and Bihar and Orissa, which are the stronghold of the orthodox, the demonstrations organised in support of the movement aroused strong resentment, and in some centres breaches of the peace were narrowly averted. 3. Though the daily bulletins issued during the progress of the fast showed that Mr. Gandhi’s condition gave no serious cause for anxiety, yet his recovery has been slow, and the most recent medical reports indicate that he must undergo complete rest for another month. Mr. Aney has, therefore, continued the suspension of civil disobedience for a further period of six weeks, solely on the ground of Mr. Gandhi’s health. The present Congress leaders are clearly un willing and indeed unable to make any further move except at the dictation of Mr. Gandhi, and he, when fit to deal with these problems, will be faced with the difficult task of reconciling the very divergent views of his former sup porters, some of whom would welcome a revival of the movement, if only they could devise some new activity that would attract public support, while others would prefer an “ indefinite suspension ” as a means of getting rid of the incubus of civil disobedience and enabling the Congress to start on other activities whereby they might recover their lost prestige and gain a dominating or at least an influential position under the new constitution. There is yet a third division ; Subhas Bose’s revolt against Mr. Gandhi was mentioned last month ; he has now gone a step further and in a recent speech in England openly announced the formation of a new organisation known as the Samyevadi Sangha ; he appears in fact to aim at combining the more extreme elements into a militant party to replace the non-violent Congress. It is useless to speculate as to what line Mr. Gandhi will take to reconcile these divergent views or to what extent he will succeed in solving the problems that confront him. 4. Meanwhile the number of persons undergoing imprisonment for offences connected with civil disobedience is steadily decreasing. At the end of March there were 12,639 ; at the end of April the number had fallen to just under 11,000 ; while at the end of May there was a further marked fall to about 9,000. This is partly due to the policy that has been followed for some months, when circumstances permitted it, of releasing those of the rank and file who are not likely to take a further part in harmful activities. 5. The campaign against the terrorists in Bengal continues to make very satisfactory progress. The arrest of some important absconders in Chittagong was briefly referred to in the last appreciation ; further reports show that the terrorists put up a determined resistance, but the operation was most efficiently carried out by the troops. The success was also largely due to the fact that an excellent intelligence system has been organised in the district. Shortly after this, some important arrests were made in Calcutta, and on this occasion also the terrorists fired on the police.2 6. In recent months about 100 terrorist convicts have been sent to the Andamans to serve their sentence, as it was found that, as long as they were kept in Indian jails, there was serious risk of their getting in touch with conspirators outside, of impairing the discipline of the jails, and even of effecting their escape. Recently some fifty of these prisoners have started a hunger-strike, nominally because certain demands of no great importance put forward by them have not been conceded, but really with a view to defy jail discipline. One prisoner died as a direct result of the fast and about the same time two others died of pneumonia, one it would seem from purely natural causes unaffected by the hunger strike on which he had barely embarked when pneumonia developed ; in the case of the other there would have been a better chance of recovery had he not been weakened by his fast. The strike has led to considerable agitation against the transportation of terrorist convicts to the Andamans. Those who support such agitation overlook entirely the serious crimes of which these convicts have been found guilty, and the reasons which make their detention in ordinary jails dangerous. Even if Government might be prepared to consider some of the grievances put forward, it is clearly not possible to do so when they are accompanied by open and concerted defiance of jail discipline. ( ^ t Lcl57HD—650—23-6-33—GIPS[Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS NO. 4 OF THE 1940 SERIES. April 19th, 1940. Public Order .—In the Frontier Province hostile gangs have suffered severely at the hands of Frontier Constabulary and other forces, and the situation has much improved. Some gangs are still giving trouble in Waziristan proper. Elsewhere the frontier is quiet. In India generally there has been no threat to public order: but a few strikes have occasioned local disturbance, the Hindu festival of Holi was marred by communal disorder in some places, and at Lahore in the Punjab the loss of more than 30 lives was caused by a lawless demonstration on the part of Khaksars. The members of this Muslim organisation, which is independent of any political party, render unquestioning obedience to their “dictator” Inayatullah: in this and other respects they follow Nazi methods; their professed aim of social service appears to be neglected: and they have come to prominent notice in defying lawful authority, for instance in the Shia-Sunni dispute at Lucknow which was described in the tenth Appreciation of 1939. At the end of February the Punjab Government issued orders designed to check the growing practice of armed “volunteer” parades and processions, usually organised on communal lines. The Khaksars chose to defy the ban, and on March 19th a strong body drawn mainly from the Frontier Province marched in military formation through Lahore, and made a violent assault on the Police who barred their way. The Khaksars carried spades (their usual emblems) sharpened so as to be capable of deadly use. They killed t#o constables and injured a dozen more: the Police Superintendent was very seriously wounded and the Deputy Superintendent has since died in hospital from injuries received: the District Magistrate also was injured. The police opened fire in self-defence and about 30 Khaksars were killed. Order was quickly restored and many arrests were made. The Punjab Government at once declared the Khaksars to be an unlawful association; the dictator Inayatullah who had kept out of the way was arrested in Delhi the same day. The Khaksar headquarters near Lahore was raided, and on this and later occasions resistance was successfully overcome without casualties with the aid of tear-smoke. It is possible that the incident was provoked by opponents of the Punjab Ministry who have since made capital out of it. Its importance was much enhanced by its happening just before the session of the Muslim League inLahore, which is described below. An adjournment motion in the Punjab Assembly about the incident was however easily defeated. A judicial enquiry on it has already started. Strikes have been in progress in Bombay, among Calcutta sweepers, in the Bihar coalfield, at Saharanpur in the United Provinces, and at Nagpur in the Central Provinces. Of these the strike in the Bombay textile mills was by far the most serious; it lasted 40 days and at one time almost the whole body of workers, numbering 150,000 was affected. The workers had obtained a rise in wages higher than the rise in the cost of living; they had no genuine grievance but were the victims of Communist agitation. They received no encouragement from other political quarters, and abandoned the strike on April 13th without having obtained any concession. A few Communist leaders were arrested for inflammatory speeches, but there was no grave disorder. The prices of food and commodities in general use have somewhat fallen in most parts of India, and are not far higher than before the war began. 2. The Provinces .—In seven Provinces the Governors continue to carry on the administration which the Congress Ministries abandoned nearly six months ago. There is no sign of dissatisfaction with the arrange ment. In one of these Provinces, Bombay, the High Court on April 11th pronounced a judgment which required immediate action on the part of the Governor in order to prevent administrative chaos. “Prohibition” in Ahmedabad and Bombay cities had been imposed by notifications issued by the Congress Ministry: the High Court found this action to be in excess nf any power conferred by the Act of 1878 under which the notifications purported to be made. The Governor at once passed an Act to remove the illegality, and so preserved the policy of “prohibition” without prejudice to such modifications in it as may appear necessary from time to time. The Ministry in Assam, which filled the gap left by the Congress resignation in November, has successfully weathered a * session of the Legislature. In Sind the Ministry, which has led a rather uneasy life since it was formed in March 1938, fell in the course of the budget session, and has been succeeded by a Muslim-Hindu coalition under a Muslim who was Revenue Minister in the defunct administration. The change has little significance in relation to politics outside the Province. 3. Political .—The annual sessions of the two most important political parties have brought interesting developments. The Congress, meeting at Ramgarh in Bihar, deliberately confined the agenda to one resolution, the text of which (summarised in the last Appreciation) had been prepared andLahore, which is described below. An adjournment motion in the Punjab Assembly about the incident was however easily defeated. A judicial enquiry on it has already started. Strikes have been in progress in Bombay, among Calcutta sweepers, in the Bihar coalfield, at Saharanpur in the United Provinces, and at Nagpur in the Central Provinces.

Irodia and the war .—India continues to render all the aid required for the prosecution of the war, and this contribution is specially remarkable in supplies and ordnance. Feeling against the enemy has notably hardened with the recent assault on Denmark and Norway. Obstruction to the administration is practically confined to speech-making and underground intrigue on the part of a small number of Communists and other revolutionaries who inspire and exploit labour unrest: and the Defence of India Act and Eules have been little employed except against them and the organs of the Press which sympathise with them. ) i♦ CONFIDENTIAL .

In the world of labour, unrest has subsided, and no strike of anv importance is now m progress. dheie has been little communal strife; the only incident of note was in Lucknow, where the perennial quarrel between Shias and Sunnis flared up in an affray m which nine persons lost their lives. 0 The threat to public order through preparations bv the Congress party 01 civil disobedience is treated below: sections which use the Conoress label as a cover for revolutionary schemes naturally exploit such preparations for thmr own purposes: and this is liable to happen particularly ~ in Bengal where the cult of terrorism has never quite died out .'The Bengal Government’ having evidence that a secret society called the Bengal Volunteer Group was contemplating early resort to active terrorism, forestalled it bv the arrest of the leading members. In Bihar Swami Sahajanand, who has long wielded an influence towards violence among the peasants, has been convicted of an offence under the Defence of India Act and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. b Political^— On April 18th Parliament approved the continuance in force of the Proclamations under Section 93 of the Constitution Act which were issued m seven Provinces about the beginning of November 1939 and which would otherwise have expired at the end of April This step was inevitable, as the Congress party still maintains the boycott of the constitu tion which found expression in the resignation of the Congress Ministriesand as other parties in these Provinces have not produced leaders who are likely to command stable majorities in the Legislatures. The tone of the debates in Parliament, while recognised as fair to Indian aspirations, has shown that the threat of civil disobedience, deliberately made in the Ramgarh resolution, has not improved the Congress case in Britain. There is naturally much surmise in India as to whether and if so when civil disobedience will begin, and what form it will take. On the one hand, every Congress committee is being converted into a committee for &lt;c satyagraha”: the enrolment of “active satyagrahis” is proceeding: and all members of local Congress committees who are not prepared to sign th’fe pledge are required to resign their positions. On the other hand, Mr. Gandhi, generalissimo of the campaign, refuses to divulge his plans to anyone. The choice, he says, lies between individual civil disobedience on a large scale, or on a very restricted scale, or confined to himself alone: a mass movement is most unlikely. This uncertainty as to the plan of campaign may in part explain the poor response to the call for satyagrahis. The Muslim League has been quiet. April 19th was proclaimed as “Pakistan Pay” to advertise the demand for separate Muslim autonomous units, but the celebrations generally lacked enthusiasm. The usefulness to the Congress of a Muslim President has been shown by his organisation of an “All-India Independent Muslim Conference”, which met at Delhi at the end of April and contested the claim of the Muslim League to speak on behalf of the Muslim community. The speeches and resolutions had a strong Congress flavour; at the same time there was an insistence on the rights of Muslims, and on the need for their protection, which implies distrust of majority rule. India and the War .—In the last Appreciation it was stated that feel ing against the enemy had notably hardened with the assault on Denmark and Norway. This can be said with even greater emphasis as regards the attack on Holland, Belgium, and Luxemburg. These crimes are vehemently denounced, and the German pretexts for them are rejected with derision. No one has spoken with authority on behalf of the two principal parties since the five countries were invaded, and it is not yet known whether their attitude towards the war will be modified. The policy of the Congress was stated in the Ramgarh resolution: and that of the Muslim League (as reported in the February Appreciation) withholds full support for Britain in the war until Mr. Jinnah has obtained a satisfactory explanation of certain points under discussion between him and the Viceroy. Meanwhile a number of statements have been made by Indian leaders, for instance by Sir Sikander Hyat Khan, the Premier of the Punjab, which suggest a growing desire that parties and communities should sink their differences in the face of the grave common danger, and labour for the victory of thec Baras 3 Allies and the strengthening of the defences of India. In quarters which foster the belief that only the failure to accept the Congress demands for constitutional changes stands in the way of whole-hearted co-operation with war, Britain is urged to remove that obstacle immediately. Comment in the press on the retreat from Norway and on the fall of Mr. Chamberlain 5 s government has for the most part been restrained and well-intentioned. Approval is given to the new government, though with some reserve among nationalists in regard to its probable attitude to Indian questions. tCONFIDENTIAL.

India and the TTar.—The progress of the German advance since May 10th has brought home to India the gravity of the war. The threat t;o India and the Empire has appeared the more serious from the entry of Italy into the war. Outside circles where the interest is mainly political, the response of India takes the form of vehement hostility to Nazi and Fascist aggression, and a keen desire that all communities, classes and interests should unite, and should be given full opportunity to aid, in the defence of India against the danger which is felt to have come appreciably nearer. On May 26th the Viceroy broadcast to the nation an appeal for unity, courage and faith. On the 31st the Commander-in-Chief announced a large expansion of India’s military effort. He mentioned ^ the vast increase in the production in India of war supplies of all kinds: this had already far outstripped what was achieved in the final year of the last war : the Ordnance factories are now turning out six or seven times (in shells, twelve times) the quantity of lethal stores produced nine months ago : the industrialists and workmen of India have risen remarkably to the occasion. As regards the Forces, over 58,000 men had been enrolled since the ^ beginning of the war: further increases, including mechanised and motorised units, artillery and technical troops, were now to he undertaken, and these would mean a total ultimate enrolment of 100,000 men. (It has since been stated that the expansion now in hand represents only the first stage.) The Royal Indian Navy had grown out of knowledge since the declaration of war. The expansion of the Indian Air Force is faced with the lack of skilled mechanics, and diffi culty in getting aeroplanes : nevertheless the scheme aims at the quadrupling of the Force. A few days later the Indian Defence Savings Movement was launched to raise funds for the cost of the military expansion; this provides savings certificates with a yield of about 3^ per cent, compound interest tax-free, bonds at 3 per cent., and also a three-year loan without interest to meet the desire to contribute without profit. Besides these military and financial measures, the Viceroy announced on June 5th the organisation of methods devised to employ the energy offered throughout India for help in the prosecution of the war. In all Provinces war2 committees are to be set up for such purposes as the dissemination of information about the war, assistance in recruitment, and support tor the savings movement: also a “ civic guard ” is to be enrolled in every Province for voluntary service in aid of internal defence, for instance m air-raid precautions, the prevention of sabotage, and the maintenance of order. The War Purposes Pund which the Viceroy opened for voluntary contri butions on the outbreak of war now totals more than Rs. 86 lakhs _ (£645,000), a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs (£37,500) has just been cabled to the President of the Prench Republic to be used for the benefit of the Prench Army. All Italian males other than missionaries were interned ^ as soon as Italy came into the war. It has also been found necessary to tighten up control of German subjects. All German males were placed in custody^ at t\i&amp; beginning of the war, but many were later released after an enquiry mto their antecedents. Experience has shown the need for the closer restrictions which have now been imposed. 2. Public order remains secure. On the North-West Frontier the opera- tions conducted since February have been successful in clearing the Ahmadzai salient of raiding gangs and establishing security forces. Vigorous action has been taken by the Punjab Government against the Khaksar agitation Q mentioned in previous Appreciations: on June 11th nearly three bundled Khaksars who were using mosques in Lahore as bases for occasipnal demons trations were arrested with the aid of tear-smoke. The Premier, in justifying the suppression of the Khaksars, announced that definite indications exist of real connection between them and the enemy. It is natural that the sudden sense of danger from abroad to a country which for so long has been preserved from it should produce some signs _ of nervousness. In some parts of India people of the commercial and propertied classes have shown unwarranted anxiety for the security of their persons and goods, and equally unwarranted doubt of the strength of the country s finances. These fears have been moderated by official action and by the exhorta tions of Mr. Gandhi and other popular leaders. The banks and post offices have shown no hesitation in meeting demands for cash, and where necessary coin has been provided in plenty. One source of prejudicial rumours, the broadcasting of German wireless propaganda, has now been checked by prohibition of the public dissemination of German and Italian programmes. 3. Political .—It will be remembered that the Congress attitude was last defined in the resolution passed at Ramgarh in March, which refused aid in the war on the ground that Britain is waging it for imperialist ends, demanded complete independence for India, and threatened civil disobedience as soon as Mr. Gandhi should give the signal. The unreality of the first assertion has become more patent at every stage of the tvar; even members of the Congress Working Committee have issued public statements inconsistent with it, andthereby have earned rebuke from the party headquarters. The prospect of civil disobedience has receded; it has become clear that the great mass of the party has no intention of taking part in any such movement, and Mr. Gandhi on June 1st announced his opinion that the Congress should “ wait till the heat of the battle in the heart of the Allied countries subsides and the future is clearer than it is The Congress Working Committee met on June 17th and is still sitting : no pronouncement has yet been made on the developments in the war. The governing body of the Muslim League met at Bombay on June 15th. It has endorsed a statement published by Mr. Jinnah at the end of May, which promised the British Government whole-hearted co-operation in return for “ trust in Muslim leadership After expressing alarm at the growing menace of Nazi aggression and denouncing the unprovoked attack of Italy on the Allies, the resolution calls on the Government to organise the defence of India to meet every eventuality. It describes the measures already announced as wholly inadequate ; and Mr. Jinnah is authorised to enter into communication with the Viceroy with a view to intensifying the war effort. A satisfactory arrangement is demanded for close co-operation “ on an all- India basis and not province-wise ” between the Government on the one hand and on the other hand the League and such other parties as are willing to undertake responsibility for defence of the country. Meanwhile, and^ until Mr. Jinnah issues further instructions after communicating with the Viceroy, Muslims should not serve on the war committees now being constituted. This decision, and a somewhat similar one announced by the Hindu Mahasabha (which however permits individuals to join the war committees and civic guards), show that the international crisis has not yet cured in India that tendency towards political manoeuvre which arises from communal distrust.CONFIDENTIAL.

India and the TFar .—The collapse of France might have been expected to weaken India’s confidence in the success of the British arms. Some nervousness still exists among people of property, and is shown for instance by withdrawals from Savings Banks and a demand for coin in preference to notes : but these symptoms are subsiding, and it is generally reported that faith in Britain’s power to achieve victory is unshaken, 'there is less talk than there was for a while of clanger to India from abroad: prices are steady, public order has been undisturbed, and in the world of labour only one or two strikes, of merely local importance, are in progress. The Royal Indian Navy suffered a casualty towards the end| of June in the loss of the JPathan, a patrol vessel of 660 tons; but this caused little excitement, except for a short time in Bombay. ¥ The strain of observing, passively and from a distance, the reverses suffered by the Allies has caused some natural depression among those (both Britons and Indians) whose desire to assist the cause is keenest, and this has led to questioning of India’s readiness for her own defence and for making her contribution to the effort of the Empire. But less is heard of such complaints as the extent of India’s activities becomes more fully known. The momentum achieved in the production of munitions and supplies is already great; almost from the beginning of the war India has not only provided her own forces with ample quantities of many types of ammunition, light armament, and equip ment, but has also supplied enormous quantities of these to the Allied forces overseas; the expansion of factories proceeds apace; and a beginning has already been made in the production of many military requirements not previously manufactured in India. The Minister of Supply in Britain, speaking in the House of Commons towards the end of June, is reported as saying “ The whole surplus capacity of India has been taken up, and the Government of India are now bringing into production various private firms. Very big things have been done in India, and a most excellent spirit exists there As samples of the expansion of the armed forces it may be mentioned that the increase in the personnel of the Royal Indian Navy is nearly 200 per cent.; that in spite of the sending of many thousands of men overseas the Army in India is now far stronger than it was at the outbreak of the war; that in addition the raising of the “ first 100,000 ” of the new forces is proceeding; that a new training establishment for Indian officer cadets is being set up, and as a&lt;y&gt; 2 result the output of Indian officers by early 1911 should be twenty times the pre-war figure ; and that the civil aviation authorities are organising for the training of 300 pilots and 2,000 mechanics to form an initial reserve upon which the regular Air Force will draw when equipment becomes available. On June 28th an Ordinance was promulgated giving power to require Indian technicians to undertake employment in the ■ national service; over 4,000 men are expected to be so obtained during the next few months. The India and Burma (Emergency Provisions) Act, passed by Parliament at the end of June, gave power (likely to he used shortly) to legislate in India for the conscription of European British subjects also, The need for such legisla tion does not arise from any lack of voluntary offers for military service— indeed, many Europeans have complained of the restrictions placed on their joining the Forces ; but from the desire to co-ordinate all kinds of activity, particularly those connected with the production of essential supplies. The organisation in the Provinces of the war committees and civic guards (mentioned in the last Appreciation) is proceeding. The Muslim League and the Congress still withhold their co-operation from these movements; among Muslims this embargo has caused a good deal of dissatisfaction, and a number of prominent persons (including Ministers in Bengal and the Punjab) have ignored it. 2. The Provinces .—The fate of prohibition ” in Bombay calls for remark. The measure imposed by the late Congress Ministry last year on the cities of Bombay and Ahmedabad was upset in April last by a decision of the High Court; the Governor at once passed an Act to remove the illegality; the High Court has however recently held that the Act did not achieve its object, and has also expressed the opinion that the powers of a Provincial Legislature to enact prohibition are limited in that the right of import and export across customs frontiers (being the domain of the Central Government and Legislature) must^ not be touched. The Bombay Government propose to apply for a certificate permitting appeal to the Federal Court against this judgment; but meanwhile the difficulties in the way of enforcing prohibition are insuperable, and the Bombay Government, while keeping the consumption of country liquor as low as possible, will relax the restrictions hitherto imposed on the purchase and possession of foreign liquor Some other matters are worthy of mention. The Bengal Government have arrested Subhas Bose (the extremist leader who became President of the Congress last year but was soon compelled to resign) to prevent his leading an agitation for the demolition of the Hoi well Monument in Calcutta which, commemorates the “ Black Hole”. The Premier on July 15th explained to the Assembly that the Government were not prepared to consider the removal of the Monument under threat of law-breaking; and the action of the Govern ment was supported by a good majority.'**B*i»'**r! 3 The Punjab Government have^ recently taken action under the Defence of India Rules against about eighty local communists, includinsr five members of tbe Provincial Assembly. This action, explained by the Premier as necessary to defeat a conspiracy inspired from abroad and aiming at widespread disorder as the preliminary to violent revolution, was approved by the Assembly sitting in secret session. Prom Orissa it is reported that negotiations are in progress between some revolting members of the Congress party and other members of the Legislature for the formation of a coalition Ministry in that Province to fill the gap left by the resignation of the Congress Ministry last November. 3. The Frontier .—In North Waziristnn an attempt was made on July 6th to kill the Resident while motoring from Bannu to Razmak: he was slightly, and an orderly who accompanied him severely, wounded. On the whole, however, the Prontier remains quiet. 4. Folitical .—The month has produced important decisions of the Congress party: and there have been discussions between the Viceroy and Messrs. Gandhi, Jinnah, and Savarkar (President of the Hindu Mahasabha). While the great mass of Indians may be presumed at this season to be concerned mainly with the prospects of the monsoon, among those who are politically articulate there appears a general desire for the greatest possible unity in the effort to win the war and ensure the safety of India. The phraseology used by the Congress Working Committee in resolutions passed on June 21st and July 7th is familiar in stating the. demand for immediate recognition of the complete independence of India; but in other respects the decisions show a new approach to the problems of the war. In effect, Mr. Gandhi’s leadership, and his doctrine of non-violence, have been discarded in the sphere of national defence. In the resolution of June 21st it was not explained how the abandonment of the principle of non-violence in dealing with external aggres sion and internal disorder would work in practice : people in tbe villages and elsewhere were to be organised by Congress for self-defence and the maintenance of public security, but beyond the appointment of a Committee to draw up rules for the training of volunteers no clue was given to the method by which Congress would repel the invader and repress internal disorder. The resolution of July 7th was passed after five days of discussion; it has been revealed by Mr. Gandhi that it was not, as is usual, passed unanimously : in fact five of the fifteen members of the Committee remained neutral, and one member (Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of the Frontier Province) has shown his dis approval of the decision by retiring from the Congress.' The main feature of the resolution is that, on certain terms, the Congress will “ throw in its full weight in the efforts for the effective organisation of the defence of the country”. The conditions are two—the acknowledgment of the complete independence of India; and, as an immediate step in giving effect to it, the4 establishment of a provisional ‘‘national government” at the Centre, so constituted as to “ command the confidence of all the elected elements in the Central Legislature and to secure the closest co-operation of the responsible Governments in the Provinces Interpretations of the resolution offered by members of the Committee vary in tone : thus while Mr. Rajagopalachari (admittedly the author of the text) describes it as a “ positive approach ” to Britain, Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru stresses the demand for independence and declares that Indians will shoulder the burden of India’s defence only for that end and not as recruiting sergeants for British Imperialism ”, Whatever the intention of the resolution, it is clear both that the Working Committee is divided against itself and that Mr. Gandhi has lost control of the immediate programme of Congress. There is in fact no part for him to play in a world at war: and his ‘'appeal to every Briton”, published on July 3rd, to lay down arms and invite Hitler and Mussolini to take possession of England has won no approval in India.

India a,nd the War .—In the course of the first year of war, especially in the latter half of it, India has suffered alarm for the fate of the British cause. But the end of the period finds the country tranquil and confident. The aerial attacks on Britain have induced sympathy for the sufferers and admiration of their calm and of the achievements of the Royal Air Force rather than fear as to the outcome; and there has been no undue anxiety caused by the withdrawal from Somaliland and the Italian advance into Western Egypt. It has been made known that between the beginning of the war and August 31st, 1940, seventy-one ships carried troops and military supplies unscathed and without the loss of a man from Indian ports to the Middle East; and that two large contingents have used the Red Sea route without incident even since the Italian occupation of British Somaliland. Public order in India continues to be secure. In a part of Waziristan military operations were necessary against the tribesmen in the middle of August; these were successful, the situation in that area has improved, and elsewhere the Frontier is quiet. The monsoon has been favourable through out India; and there has been no trouble worth mentioning in the industrial world. India’s response to the needs of the war is copious; as Mr. Amery has said “India by the end of the first year of war has made a powerful contribu tion to the common cause. The momentum of her war effort is increasing from week to week and will continue increasing during the coming year”. Some idea of the movement of troops can be obtained from the figure of 944 special military trains that ran to and from Indian ports in the first year of the war. The “Eastern Group” Conference which will assemble in Delhi in October was mentioned in the last Appreciation. A mission from Great Britain also, headed by Sir Alexander Roger, has arrived in India, this will investigate the means of still further increasing India’s production of munitions and other war stores, both for her own needs and for those of the Forces in the Middle and Near East. In order to secure the free movement of goods in the country, the Government of India in consultation with commercial interests have enacted a scheme of war-risk insurance on goods travelling on land or inland water ways in India. Government will be the insurer; all sellers of goods (with certain specified exceptions) holding goods to a value of Rs. 20,000 or morein any District or Presidency town will have to insure them against war risks, i.e., enemy action or damage caused in repelling enemy action. Persons holding goods worth less than Rs. 20,000 can insure them if they wish, subject to payment of a minimum premium. The initial premium has been hxed at the rate of half an anna per hundred rupees per month for the first three months. The scheme is open from 1st October and insurance under it will become compulsory from 1st November. Contributions to the Viceroy’s War Purposes Fund now amount to more than £1,350,000: and by the end of the first week of September nearly £18 millions had been contributed to Indian Defence Loans. Pollti cal. -The last Appreciation gave the terms of the declaration made by the Viceroy on 8th August and debated in Parliament on 14th August. The immediate purpose of this was to assist in the promotion of the unity required for the most efficient prosecution of the war by expanding the Governor-General’s Executive Council and by setting up a War Advisory Council containing representatives of Indian States and of other interests in the national life of India. Participation in these projects has been flatly rejected by the Congress; resolutions passed by the Working Committee on August 22nd and the All-India Congress Committee on 17th September make it clear that the Congress party will in no way assist in the prosecution of the war. Mr. Gandhi is now to resume full control of Congress action; he will shortly seek an interview with the Viceroy, and will demand complete free dom for Congressmen to preach throughout India against support being given to the prosecution of the war in any form, whether by recruitment of men or raising of money; if this demand is granted, there will be no civil disobedience. ^ The motives professed for this return to a policy of resolute non-co-operation are confused and inconsistent; though credit is claimed for resumption of the unalloyed pursuit of non-violence, sheer opportunism appears in the frank admission that the Congress party cannot doom itself to extinction by continuing to refrain from action which will embarrass the Government. Attemps are being and will be made to represent India both as opposed to the prosecution of the war and as the victim of determined repression. The first claim is untrue outside the ranks of the Congress party and by no means wholly true within those ranks. The answer to the charge of repres- sion is that the Defence of India Act was passed by the Central Legislature though m the absence of Congress without a division on any point of principle, and that the number of persons against whom the Act and Rules have been used m very small; for instance in a Province where repression is alleged to be specially severe the number towards the end of August was only 300 persons out of a population (in 1931) of about 50 millions. Another Congress grievance is the order passed by the Government of India in Augustforbidding the performance by unofficial bodies of evolutions of a military nature; it is remarkable that an order directed against the parade of force has been questioned and disobeyed only by the one organization (Congress) which professes the cult of non-violence. While the Congress leaders were resuming their full allegiance to that cult in Bombay on 15th September, five lives were lost (including that of a Police officer stoned to death) in concerted riots caused by Congressmen in five places in Malabar. The response of other political bodies to the Viceroy’s declaration of 8th August has not yet been translated into action. The Working Committee of the Muslim League, while authorising Mr. Jinnah to obtain further information on certain points, have welcomed the offer, and have withdrawn the ban temporarily imposed on membership of War Committees. It is to be hoped that Congress may be the only organization refusing to be connected with the expansion of the Governor-General’s Executive Council and the establishment of the War Advisory Council.[Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 11 of the 1940 series, November 17th, 1940. India and the War .—India has followed with close interest the Italian attempt to ravish Greece, with its threat to the security of Turkey and the Islamic countries of the Middle East. But public confidence in Britain’s ability to defeat the Axis powers has not been shaken thereby. Our recent successes against the Italian fleet provide welcome encouragement. The Eastern Group Conference was opened by the Viceroy on October 25th. His Excellency read a message from Mr. Churchill which spoke of the Conference “building a new world of armed strength to redress the balance of the old”. The delegates in reply stated their determination to formulate a co-ordinated plan for the most efficient utilisation of the resources of supply, with the sole object of strengthening the Empire’s effort O to bring the war to a successful conclusion. The task of the Conference has so far been carried on by a number of sub-committees, most of which have now completed their work and submitted their reports to the central committee. A fuller public description of India’s war effort than has hitherto been possible was given by the Finance Member of the Government of India when introducing a Supplementary Finance Bill in the Central Legislative Assembly to meet the great increase in expenditure on war needs. India is now engaged in providing as a first step an army which will amount to nearly half a million men of all arms, trained, equipped and mechanised according to modern standards. More than 60,000 troops have gone over seas; and more than 100,000 men, a large proportion of whom are already fully trained, have joined, the colours. The number of military motor vehicles of various types, which before the war was about 5,000, is now 30,000 and by next year is expected to be double that figure. Armour- plate, which has never been produced in India before, is now being successfully manufactured. Since the war began over one hundred million rounds of small arms ammunition and nearly 400,000 rounds of gun ammunition of various kinds have been sent overseas. The Royal Indian Navy, which started from much smaller beginnings than the Army, has developed proportionately even more. Not only are the sloops of the Indian Navy assisting the Royal Navy in Indian waters, but Indian ports and harbours are guarded by a large and growing fleet of mine-sweepers and anti-submarine patrol boats. Powerful and well-armed mine-sweeping craft, corvettes, and patrol boats are being constructed in Indian yards. The Indian Air Force is also expanding as quickly as possible, and^ will receive an impetus on the arrival from the United Kingdom of a large number t \ of service aircraft for training purposes. Conditions caused by the war result in a drop of nearly £2^ millions in the estimated revenue of the current year, in additional civil expenditure in the year estimated at nearly £1| millions, and in defence expenditure exceeding the estimate for the year by nearly £11 millions, with still greater commitments in coming years. The defence expenditure for the year is likely to reach at least £51 millions. The proposals for fresh taxation, designed to cover some part of the deficit of the year, are a 25 per cent, surcharge on all taxes on income and increased postal, telegraph and telephone rates. Political. —Mr. Gandhi’s campaign, directed against the prosecution of the war on the pretext of asserting the right of freedom of speech, was opened by an obscure person who delivered addresses to sparse audiences of villagers. He was tried and sentenced to a short term of imprisonment. Mr. Gandhi’s next choice was a far more effective propagandist, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru; but before the Pandit could begin his task he was put on his trial for speeches delivered early in October and sentenced to four years’2 V imprisonment. In view of Mr. Gandhi's professed desire to avoid all passion in the campaign it is notable that he should have selected at so early a stage a- champion whose recent speeches (those for which he has been convicted) have been violent and inflammatory. Mr. Gandhi has recently been hinting that the “inner voice” may at any time require him to fast; but for the present he has been induced by his followers to ignore it; and the immediate programme is the extension of civil disobedience by various groups of prominent Congressmen, such as the members of the Working Committee and All-India Committee and members of the Central and Provincial Legislatures. The country does not appear to be much excited by the prospect. The arrest of Pandit Nehru and the heavy sentence imposed by the Magistrate caused some stir; but on the whole interest in Mr. Gandhi’s campaign is tempered with bewilderment at his tactics. The Congress members of the Central Assembly are not at the moment free for the task of civil disobedience, since after more than a year’s absten tion they are attending the session in the hope of obstructing the prosecution of the war by defeating the Finance Bill. The Muslim League has not been active lately; but the last day of the Ramzan fast was observed by members of the League throughout India for the purpose of demonstrating the deep feeling of sympathy and concern of Muslim India with Muslim countries threatened with aggression. Public Order .—The country has been free from major disturbances of any kind, though in Sind a series of individual murders of Hindus has prevented the subsidence of that communal hostility which a year ago caused serious loss of life in a part of the Province.

India mid the War .—Previous Appreciations have mentioned signs of nervousness among certain classes in India. These have subsided ; and confidence in the success of the British arms has been especially strengthened by the achievements of the Royal Air Force in Europe. The monsoon is favourable, and prices remain steady. Public order is generally undisturbed ; exceptions worthy of mention are instances of communal violence in some Provinces, and in Waziristan a number of outrages including sniping of troops and an attempt to ambush the Commander of the Bannu Brigade: also there is strong reason for suspecting sabotage as the cause of a railway accident in Bengal in which 36 persons were killed. Hoarding of coin has led to a dearth of rupees, and this has been met by the issue of one-rupee notes—the convenience of which is remembered from the experience of the last war. Contributions to the Viceroy’s War Purposes Fund have now reached one crore of rupees (three- quarters of a million pounds); in addition other funds in various parts of the country have been generously supported. Conscription of Europeans in India for work of national importance, whether in the armed forces or otherwise, was recently introduced. This was forecast in the last Appreciation, and it was there explained that the measure is needed not because of any lack of voluntary offers for military service but for the co-ordination of all kinds of effort devoted to the prosecution of the war. The last Appreciation mentioned also the legislation passed at the end of June to give power to specially constituted tribunals to direct Indian technicians to undertake employment in Government factories and private factories engaged on work of national importance. Though this is the first instance of such compulsion in India, the measure has been well received ; and the demand for employment in the national service is so great that tribunals have been required throughout the country. In addition to providing in this way for the compulsory recruitment of technicians, the Government of India will shortly introduce a scheme designed to expand and improve the facilities for technical training, and to adapt that training to meet the needs of war-time industry, so that a steady stream of workers should be available to fill the gaps left in civil industry by the calling up of technicians—of whom 10,000 may be absorbed during the next twelve months. The “ first hundred thousand ” men to be added to the regular Indian Army are being trained and equipped as fast as possible by arrangementsspecial!) devised for the emergency. Recruits have offered themselves at the rate of over 15,000 a month. From the Indian States 16 units of all arms are serving alongside His Majesty’s Forces. The Indian Territorial Force has been raised from 16^ battalions to 25-^ battalions, and the battalion establish ment has been increased by 25 per cent. For 350 vacancies in the Indian Air Force there were 18,000 applications. The problem of Army expansion is more a matter of equipment than of men; but the production of material has enormously increased.^ In Ordnance Factories a- 22-hour working day has been the rule for some time past ; and much material is being newly manufactured in them and in civil factories, for instance armoured plating for tanks which is as good as any made elsewhere. It has recently been announced that the Government of India in consulta tion with His Majesty’s Government have invited Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Burma, Malaya, Hong Kong, Ceylon and the East African territories to send representatives to a conference in New Delhi in October, in order to settle a joint policy and permanent arrangements for the co-ordination and development of their resources for the purposes of the war. The invitations have been accepted. 2. Political. — A. meeting of the All-India Congress Committee, held at Poona at the end of July, was poorly attended; only about half the members were present; and though the resolutions framed by the Working Committee on June 21st and July 7th were carried, the members who voted for them numbered only a half of those present, the opposition was considerable, and a good many members declined to vote. The total effect is to commit the Congress party to a programme which nominally retains the principle of non violence in the “ struggle for freedom ” but abandons it in the sphere of national defence; and to demands for an acknowledgment of the complete independence of India, and (as an immediate step towards it) the establishment of a provisional “ national Government ” at the Centre; if these demands are granted the Congress will throw in its full weight “ in the organisation of the defence of the country ”. But the discussions at the Poona meeting showed the uneasiness of a large section at this discarding of the leadership and doctrine of Mr. Gandhi (who did not attend the session), and at the same time gave little reason to suppose that the intention of the Working Committee is to lend genuine and material assistance in the country’s war effort even if the demands are granted. The meeting gave an impression of bewilderment, doubt and dissensions in the Congress party. On August 8th an announcement of great importance was made by the Viceroy on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. The purpose of this was stated to be the promotion of the unity required for the fulfilment of India’s desire to make the fullest possible contribution in the world struggle against3 tyranny and aggression: it referred to the declaration of the Government’s intentions made some months ago (see the Appreciation of November 17th, 1939), one of which was the inclusion of a certain number of representatives of political parties in the Governor-General’s Council provided that a basis of agreement could be found by the major political parties in the Provincial field: that agreement had unfortunately not been reached: nevertheless the Government would no longer postpone the expansion of the Governor-General’s Council and the setting up of a body which will closely associate Indian public opinion with the conduct of the war: the Governor-General will accordingly invite some representative Indians to join bis Executive Council, and will also establish a War Advisory Council containing representatives of the Indian States and of other interests in the national life of India as a whole. The pronouncement went on to clear doubts entertained in certain quarters as to the intentions of His Majesty’s Government. As regards the position of minorities in any future constitu tional scheme, it bad already been made clear that no part either of the Act of 1935 or of the policy and plans on which it is based would be excluded from re-examination : and the Government could not contemplate the transfer of their present responsibilities for the peace and welfare of India to any system whose authority is denied by large and powerful elements in India’s national life, i or could they be parties to the coercion of such elements into submission to such a system. Next, though fundamental constitutional issues could not be decisively resolved at a moment when the Commonwealth is engaged in a struggle for existence, the Government will most readily assent to the setting up after the war with the least possible delay of a body representative of the principal elements in India’s national life in order to devise the frame work of the new Constitution: the framing of the constitutional scheme would be primarily the responsibility of Indians themselves, subject to the fulfilment of the obligations which Britain’s long connection with India has imposed upon her; the British Government would lend all possible aid to hasten decisions on all relevant matters: and even during the war will promote in any way possible an agreement among representative Indians as to the form which the post-war body should take, the methods by which it should arrive at its conclusions, and the outlines of the constitution itself. The pronouncement ended with an appeal for co-operation in a notable Indian contribution to the victory of the cause which is at stake, and the acceleration thereby of “ the attainment by India of that free and equal partnership in the British Commonwealth which remains the proclaimed and accepted goal of the Imperial Crown and of the British Parliament”. The response of the major political parties will not be definitely known till their controlling bodies have met in the next few days. Mr. Amery, in the House of Commons debate of August 14th, spoke of the discouraging attitude shown in Congress quarters; he expressed the hope that all leaders4 will be willing to take tbeir part, but said that, if that should unfortunately not prove to be the case, Lord Linlithgow would of course still go ahead with those who will work with him and with each other. He described the status offered to India—that of Britain and the Dominions in the Commonwealth—as not an inferior or dependent status; “ there is no higher status in the world, and that is the status which w T e have declared to be the goal of our policy in India .1 \ sConfidential Apprecia tion for the Dominions. Eo.10 of the 1940 aeries, October 18th, 1940* October 18th, 1940. India and the War# The failure of the Germans to carry out the intended invasion of England, or to break the spirit of the country by the indiscriminate bombing of London and other areas, and the halt of the Italian advance into Egypt, have brought to India increased confidence in the British arras# The recent activities of Japan - the pact with Germany and Italy, and the incursion into Indo-Ohina are of special interest to India, but have aroused little ex- -citeraent; the decision to reopen the Burma road to China is welcomed everywhere, even by Congress spokesmen# The gallant and skilful part played by Indian forces in the operation in British Somaliland has been made known. Till the time comes for more fighting in the Middle East, India’s war effort is mainly in the field of supply. The Members of the*Eastern Group** Conference will shortly be assembling in Hew Delhi where their deliberations will begin; on 25th October. The main object of the Conference is the settle- -ment of a joint war-supply policy for the countries concer- -ned; but the exchange of information outside the Conference is expected to be of great help to the various Governments in determining the future development of their trade-control policies# Sir Alexander Hoger and the members of the Mission appointed by the British Ministry of Supply have been visiting the industrial areas of India. The import- -ance to India’s military and economic future of these deliberations is understood and appreciated even in quarters which/2 whcih profess non-cooperation in the prosecution of the war; for instance f one newspaper, consistently unfriendly to the British Governroent, says 'India has the right to defend her- -self. Today it has become an urgent duty* We hope that the natural issue of the Roger Mission will be a eelf-depend- -ent India, able to take care of herself against the most powerful aggressor* as such we welcome it'* It is worth remembering that India has been ranked by the International Labour Office of the League of Nations as one of the twelve main industrial countries of the world* Of the 40,000 items required by the defence forces she is already producing half, and every endeavour is being made to produce the remainder.

While Mr. Ghandi still employs the language of pacifism, the motive behind the Congress attitude has been frankly avowed by the I resident of the Party, who says *the Indian national Congress is not a pacifist society? it is a political organisation struggling for a definite objective. 1 * The tactics of the Congress High Command have met with much criticism, especially as freedom of speech is not permitted to dissident members of the Party.

December 19 th, 1940. India and the War .—The remarkable repulse of the Italian invasion of Greece, and the brilliant, success of the British attack in north-western Egypt have been much applauded in India, and have left little cause for anxiety about the security of the countries lying between India and the scene of the war. Tlie tribute paid by His Majesty’s Government to the spirit and tenacity of the Indian officers and men who took part in the recapture of Gallabat has been appreciated ; and still more the news that in the Egyptian victory Indian troops (in the words of the Viceroy) “have shown themseives worthy of their highest traditions and have borne themselves with the utmost distinction”. The concluding session of the Eastern Group Conference was held on November 25th. The Conference has been of the greatest value, both for what it has done and for what it should make possible. The interchange of information between the delegations brought to light facts and opportunities hitherto unsuspected; and even before the Conference ended it was found possible, by using surpluses in equipment for existing requirements, to supply serious deficiencies without waste of time or undue call on shipping space. The appointment in India of a representative standing body to continue the work of the Conference, and within a defined field to co-ordinate supply,, plan production, and assist in arranging new sources of production, is being recommended by the delegations to their Governments. In the meanwhile the Government of India have agreed to retain a portion of the Conference Secretariat to meet the immediate needs. As a result of the Conference, the Mission of the Ministry of Supply under Sir Alexander Roger has not only received full information as to the actual and potential capacity of the countries represented, but also has in its hands the programme of production allotted to India by the Conference. The Mission has already made a partial and preliminary examination of India’s resources and is now in a position to undertake a complete survey. Members of the Mission are visiting important centres of production in order to devise methods of carrying out the allotted programme to the greatest effect. The announcement by the British Minister for Labour towards the end of November that several hundred men from Indian workshops would go to England for advanced training has been well received. Mr. Bevin’s plan dovetails into the Indian scheme of technical training mentioned in the2 seventh and eighth Appreciations of this year—a scheme estimated to cost nearly three quarters of a million pounds and to increase the supply of artisans by 15.000 men in a year. Tne first batch of 50 candidates will leave India for England about the middle of January. They will live in the homes of working-class families, and no part of the cost will fall on themselves. The stage of expansion of the Indian Army, which required the raising of 100.000 additional men, is substantially complete, and tbe country has now moved on to the next stage of raising an army amounting to nearly half a million men of all arms, properly trained, equipped, and mechanized. In the course of expansion the practice whereby selected units were Indianized has been abolished ; now all units are open to Indian officers ; also recruitment of men has been extended to many classes and castes not previously enlisted. 2. Political.—At a joint session of the Legislature ^on November 20th the Viceroy announced the decision of His Majesty s Government not to proceed at present with the expansion of the Executive Council or the establishment of the War Advisory Council, which were offered in the Viceroy’s statement of August 8th. This decision was, with regret, made because the major political parties in India, for reasons which are conflicting and in some ways mutually destructive, were not prepared to accept the opportunity offered to them. But the proposals h ive not been withdrawn, and are still open if a sufficient degree of representative support is forthcoming. Speaking in London the following day, the Secretary of SL'te appealed to Indians to study afresh the constitutional problem of India. Certain passages in this speech were taken by the Hindu Press to imply encouragement of the “ Pakistan ” scheme for the division of India into a Hindu nation and a Muslim nation ; but speaking on December 12th, Mr. Amery laid stress on the intimate connection between the political unity given to India by British rule and the development of individual freedom and national self-government. Once broken up into separate and independent entities, India would relapse into a welter of contending powers in which free institutions would he suppressed, and in which no one element would be able to defend itself against external attack. The Viceroy’s offer had for the moment been rejected, not because it was inadequate but because the spirit of India First was not strong enough to overcome the insistence on unpractical demands on one side or undue suspicion on the other. Meanwhile the civil disobedience campaign in India is developing under Mr. Gandhi’s guidance. Congress leaders over most of the country have courted imprisonment by uttering slogans against the prosecution of the war. The conduct of the law-breakers has for the most part followed Mr. Gandhi’s instructions against the rousing of popular excitement; but even the arrest and imprisonment of ^-Premiers and other well-known figures has up to the3 present kindled little interest. In some urban areas disturbances have shown the danger of violence if the movement spreads. At present it has been restricted to a few hundred leaders; but it is doubtful whether Mr. Gandhi and the Congress President will be content for long with the effects produced by so futile a campaign. The Congress party in the Central Assembly (before courting imprison ment) succeeded in their hope of obstructing the prosecution of the war by d heating (by 55 votes to 53) the supplementary Finance Bill. This was achieved with the help of the Congress Nationalist party, whose leader however explained that his party was merely following its tradition of opposing Finance Bills, and that he would assist the war effort outside the House. The Muslim League refrained from voting. The Bill was “certified” by the Governor-General and was thereupon passed by the Council of State by 27 votes to 11. In the course of the debate most of the Congress speakers permitted themselves extraordinary licence, and the tone of the speeches was such as to discredit both the cl iim that the party is devoted to the principle of non-violence and the pretence that the party, if the exorbitant demands made in its name last July had been accepted, would have given effective co-operation in the war. The attitude of the Government and the country towards the civil disobedience campaign was summed up by the Viceroy, speaking in Calcutta on December 16th, as follows “ We have a duty to this country to see that India’s war effort, which I am certain has India behind it, is not in any way impeded, that not a single sepoy is deprived of the arms and ammunition that he needs, whether by speeches or by more active forms of opposition. ” 3. Public Order .—Apart from the mild ferment which the Congress campaign has engendered, and some unrest among students which can be related both to that campaign and to underground communist agencies, the only breach of public order has been in Waziristan. There hostile gangs have become more active with the close of Ramzan) and on December 7th Government forces suffered casualties amounting to 40 killed and as many injured in an encounter near Razmak.CONFIDENTIAL.

India and the W ar.—Further information has made more fully known the part played by Indian forces in the brilliant successes of the North African campaign; and this has earned a congratulatory message to the Commander-in-Chief in India from the Army Council. Sir Sikander Hyat Khan, Premier of the Punjab, after a visit to Egypt has brought back a highly satisfactory account of the training, condition and spirit of the . Indian troops. The progress of the war, in Africa and Albania especially, has strengthened public confidence; and evidence of this is seen in increased bookings for the annual pilgrimage of Muslims to the Hedjaz. In the latter half of December a Turkish Military Mission returning ^ from Afghanistan visited Peshawar, Lahore and Karachi. They were received very cordially in India, and the leader of the Mission in a message of thanks to the Viceroy and the Government has spoken of the close bonds of friendship and interest which unite Turkey and India. 2. Political.—The Christmas season has as usual been the occasion of a number of political conferences. The Hindu Mahasabha meeting at Madura, and the National Liberal Federation meeting at Calcutta, have both demanded a declaration as to the date by which Dominion Status will be achieved; the former fixes the term at one year, the latter at two years, after the end of the war. The Liberal Federation would like to see the Central Government immediately reconstructed so as to exhibit a national unity which unfortunately does not at present exist in the political world. In both conferences exhortations were made for support to India’s war effort. Both denounced the “^Pakistan” scheme of the Muslim League, which Mr. Jinnah has lately reaffirmed. The Mahasabha proclaimed that, if the British Government does not by the end of March satisfy its demand for declarations both in regard to Dominion Status and against the Pakistan project, it will resort to “direct action”; but this attempt to borrow Congress thunder has not alarmed the country. Another meeting worthy of mention was convened in Calcutta by Mr. M. N. Roy, the communist leader who in recent months has revolted from the Congress and is preaching support to the war effort with the destruction of “Fascism” as his goal. He has received some publicity for his plan, which aims at more popular control of policy both at the Centre,,rtilllg 2 A and in the Provinces where Congress once ruled; but it is too early to estimate the influence^of the movement. The letter signed by nine Members of Parliament which just before Christmas pleaded for a fresh consideration of the Viceroy’s offer of August 8th was coldly received among Congressmen. Mr. Gandhi’s campaign of civil disobedience not only places the party in active hostility to the Government but also widens the gulf between it and other sections of the public; it amounts in fact to a deliberate rejection of any solution for the political deacUoclf except surrender to the Congress demands. The phase of the campaign which required the more prominent leaders to court imprisonment ended before Christmas, and Mr. Gandhi announced a truce till January 6th when the next phase brought the smaller fry into the conflict. Mr. Gandhi professes to desire quality rather than quantity in his army, and .each satyagrahi is supposed to be a genuine believer in the peculiarly Gandhian tenets such as non-violence and the efficacy of spinning. But the movement suffers both from some lack of enthusiasm among the faithful and from apathy among the general public. Mr. Gandhi, who js.accustomed to boundless publicity in the Press, is hampered by the restrictions placed by the Defence of India Rules on anti-war propaganda. Moreover, there is little doubt that Congress stock has been falling for some time; so far as the present figures of membership of the party are known, they are much smaller than those of the previous two years. Faced with these discouragements, Mr.,Gandhi in his latest statement seems to have forgotten his earlier protestations about refraining from causing embarrassment to Britain during the war. He now says:—“This is not a struggle which can be ended quickly. We are resisting an authority that is itself struggling in a fight for life against a stubborn foe Our struggle must be coterminous at least with the European”. The Congress President, who was not yet destined for satyagraha, was arrested early in January and convicted of making an actionable speech on December 13th. Little interest was taken in the event. 3. Ptiblic Order .—The Muslim festival of Bakr-Id, often the occasion of communal discord, passed off peacefully on January 9th. The labour world continues satisfactorily free from disturbances. The agrarian situa tion also is generally undisturbed, though the disposal of an excessive sugar crop in two Provinces presents a difficult problem. In Waziristan, the Government forces, as was mentioned in the last Appreciation, suffered 90 casualties in an engagement on December 7th. Prompt action taken by reinforcements succeeded in localising the trouble and inducing the tribes men to accept Government’s terms without further fighting. The Fakir of Ipi has been attempting to maintain his prestige in North Waziristan by despatching his lieutenants attended by large gangs of tribesmen to impose tribal settlements on the British-protected areas.[Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 2 of the 1941 Series, February 20th, 1941. India and the War .—The speed of the advance of the Imperial forces in Libya, finally outstripping all expectations in the capture of Benghazi, has given great pleasure in India, and indeed fostered hopes which are not yet justified by a view of the whole field of the war, and which recently have been checked by surmise as to what may happen in the Balkans and the Ear East. The new Commander-in-Chief, Sir Claude Auchinleck, assumed charge on January 26th. In a broadcast on February 9th he gave his impressions of Indian troops whom he saw in Africa on his journey out; never, he said, in his long service with Indian soldiers had he seen units which looked happier or fitter. The Extern Group Conference (see the Appreciation of December 1940) is bearing fruit in the establishment of an Eastern Group Council the Chair man of which (Sir Archibald Carter, late Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty) has already arrived. The Council will be an autonomous body,, independent of the Government of India but working in close collaboration with all the Empire countries concerned. It will contain representatives of India, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. There is growing interest in the Bevin training scheme, mentioned in the December Appreciation. The first party of 50 men, of whom all except four are factory hands, has just sailed for England. 2. Economic conditions in India at the present time may be described as the resultant of two separate sets of forces, both springing directly out of the war. So far as agriculture is concerned, a considerable part of the Euiopean maiket has been lost, and this has seriously affected both the prices of agricultural produce and the possibilities of disposing of the large amount of produce which would normally be exported. For certain other products, however, large new demands have arisen, e.g., mica and manganese ore, with the result that, taking India’s foreign trade as a whole, losses in one direc tion have been more than compensated by gains in other directions; and, in the first eight months of the present fiscal year, India’s exports were £7 million in excess of the exports in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. Government have, however, had to intervene in order to produce more stable economic conditions in the case of the jute crop and active measures to assist the groundnut growers are at present under2 consideration. The position of the sugar growers, alsp,- continues to give rise to anxiety, but the well-organised coffee growers have drawn up a rationalisation scheme without calling upon the Government for financial assistance. So far as industrial activity is concerned, the situation is greatly affected by the growing volume of orders placed both by the Government of India and by other Imperial Governments. Such evidence as is available, (e.g., the prices of industrial raw materials, railway traffic and receipts, postal traffic and receipts) point to improved economic conditions generally in industrial areas. Basic financial conditions are sound; in fact, the banks find it difficult to invest available funds profitably and money is cheap. The wave of currency hoarding noticeable last summer has come to an end, and there is much less nervousness in investment circles. Sterling assets of the Central Bank have mounted greatly since the war broke out, and the balance of trade position has much improved. The strength of India’s financial position is demonstrated by the recent decision to repatriate as far as possible the whole of her terminable sterling debt, amounting to nearly £90 million. 3. Political. —Mr. Gandhi’s campaign of civil disobedience goes on. The total number of his followers convicted hitherto is about 3,000. Enthusiasm among Congressmen is lacking; and it is permissible to doubt whether the movement would get as many adherents but for the knowledge that imprisonment in this campaign is the essential qualification for future preferment in the Congress hierarchy. Since many of the satyagrahis are unimportant persons, performing a ceremonial act with little pretence of belief in its merit, it has been found possible in some Provinces either to ignore them or to impose fines instead of imprisonment. If an instance were required to show how far present conditions fall short of the impression which Congress would like to give the world (and which is fostered by enemy radio)—of a national upheaval meeting with ruthless repression, it could be found in the celebration of “Independence Day” on January 26th. This annual ritual was performed in a tepid atmosphere of symbolic sedition, arousing little public interest and no opposition from the authorities. The efforts of Mr. Gandhi to obtain publicity for his campaign, and the determination of Government that matters directly prejudicial to the successful prosecution of the war shall not be published, have led to some difficulty with the nationalist Press. But good relations have been maintained as a result of a meeting at the beginning of February of the standing committee of the All-India Editors’ Conference; and^ a fresh assurance has been given that the Press desire to co-operate with the Government.&gt;: 3 Subhas Bose, the leader of Bengal Left-Wing politics, who was stand ing his trial for certain objectionable speeches and articles, and who was released from jail in December as a result of a hunger-strike, disappeared from his house in Calcutta at the end of January and is still untraced. 4. General .—A Labour Conference held at the end of January in Delhi has recommended labour reforms of a far-reaching character. They include the prohibition of strikes and lock-outs while attempts at concilia tion are being made, the granting of holidays with pay to factory workers, the regulation of the working conditions of shop employees, and the extension of maternity benefit legislation to women employed in coal mines. Trade negotiations between Indian and Burman delegations began in Delhi on February 4th. The Budget session of the Central Legislature began on February 11th. The Congress members are absent, and most of them have courted imprison ment since they voted down the Finance Bill last November. The Muslim festival of Mohurrum on February 8th passed off without disorder in most places, though there was a serious disturbance in Jubbulpore (Central Provinces) and the police had to use tear-smoke to disperse a riotous Muslim mob in Calcutta. The situation in South Waziristan is still far from stable, but has improved since the operations described in the last Appreciation. The main focus of trouble shifted to North Waziristan where a notorious out law named Shodi Khel and his gang have been demanding tribute from villages in the Tochi Valley. Shodi Khel himself was killed in the course of a combined operation by the Tochi Scouts and the R.A.F. on February 1st, but his disappearance has not restored the situation, and operations have been undertaken against his following.HHi gr ■' liil iihlv!:!

No. 3 of the 19U Series, March 18th, 1941- India and the War .—India has reason to watch with special attention the course which the war may take in the Balkan area and south-eastwards of it. Meanwhile the disruption of the Italian empire, and the part that Indian troops continue to play in the African operations, give great satis faction; and the material and moral support of the IT. S. A', ot which the passing of the Lease and Lend Bill is a token, brings assurance that the schemes of the Axis powers will be defeated. His Majesty the King-Emperor has sent a message to the Princes and people of India thanking them for the “constant and invaluable stream of men, money and material to swell the rising tide of the Empire’s war resources”, and expressing confidence that India’s magnificent support will be maintained until victory crowns our arms. The Eastern Group Supply Council (mentioned in the last Apprecia tion) is now assembled in Delhi, and is entering on its task. The second war budget of the Central Government was presented in the Legislative Assembly on Eebruary 28th. The revenue for 1941-42 is estimated at nearly £80 millions, and the expenditure at £95 millions. The civil estimates account for about a third .of the expenditure; the defence budget amounts to £63 millions, which is more than double the normal defence expenditure. The expected deficit of about £15 millions is to be met to the extent of nearly £5 millions by additional taxation, and the remainder by loans. The new taxation measures are the raising of the nxcess profits tax from 50% to 66f %, increase of the surcharge on income- tax and super-tax frtun 25% to 33J%, increase of the excise duty on matches and of the import duty on artificial silk yarn, and an excise duty on tvres and tubes. The budget has been well received; a greater increase of taxation would not have caused surprise. The launching of the Indian Defence Savings Movement was mentioned in the Appreciation of last June. Defence Loans up to February 22nd amount to over £384 millions, including £lf millions invested in interest- free bonds. The Viceroy’s War Purposes Fund amounts to more than £2| millions. In addition there are funds raised in every Province, the largest of which (Madras) amounts to nearly three-quarters of a million pounds. Since the Congress party is absent from the Central Legislature, the session has been quiet and criticism of the Government’s conduct of the war has2 not been hostile; general appreciation has been shown of announcements made by the Commander-in-Chief that the classes from which army recruit ment is made are to be extended, and that the association of representatives of the public with defence matters is to be increased. Political .—The civil disobedience movement proceeds languidly; and doubts of the wisdom of Mr. Gandhi’s leadership have been deepened, both within the Congress and outside it, by a statement made by him in the middle of February that during the war there can be no settlement with the Congress, short of the grant of complete independence, because Congress cannot commit itself to active help in war with men and money. Later he attempted to qualify this frank utterance by a hint that other Congress leaders can disown it if they wish; but, since it expresses his own creed and since his control of the party is now unquestioned, the responsibility for the political deadlock is placed where it belongs. A conference of about 40 prominent Indians not belonging to either Congress or the Muslim League met at Bombay on March 13th and 14th to find a remedy for the deadlock. They passed a resolution which urges that the Governor-General’s Executive Council should be immediately reconstructed so as to consist wholly of non-official Indians; the reconstruct ed Government, while remaining responsible to the Crown, should deal with all important matters on a basis of joint and collective responsibility; in all inter-imperial and international affairs it should be treated on the same footing as the Dominions Governments. A request is also made for a declara tion by His Majesty’s Government that within a specified time-limit after the conclusion of the war, India, will enjoy the same measure of freedom as Britain and the Dominions. This pronouncement is open to the criticism that it ignores the very con ditions—in particular the communal gulf, and the attitude of the main political parties to the offers made by His Majesty’s Government—which have produced the present difficulties. The Congress, attitude has been mentioned above; the Council of the Muslim League, meeting at Delhi on February 23rd, reaffirmed its belief in the scheme for partitioning India, and accused the Congress of starting civil disobedience with deliberate intent to force the Government to withdraw its undertakings for the protec tion of the interests of minorities in the framing of the future constitution. The Census .—March 1st was the date of reference for the all-India census. The results so far received indicate a total population of about 400 millions. This means an increase of 18 per cent, since 1931, whereas the increase between 1921 and 1931 was ten per cent. The increases are higher in the north than in the south. Some of the reasons for the large rate of growth are that the decade has been on the whole healthy and prosperous, and public health and irrigation measures are showing their effect. Anotherinfluence, at any rate in the north of the country, is a more complete record, due to some changes in system and to full co-operation by the public. In some parts indeed co-operation induced by communal rivalry has been excessive; but even there it is expected that reliable figures will be obtained. The cost of the census, including everything from enumeration to the produc tion of final tables, is the remarkably low figure of about £1 per thousand persons; an achievement only possible because the enumeration is carried out by the people themselves, and nearly all the work is unpaid. Although technically the census is an activity of the Central Government, it has received the full assistance of all provincial and State agencies. General. The budget sessions of the Legislatures of the four provinces in which the normal working of the Constitution has not been suspended are in progress. The Congress Opposition are not attending in Assam, Bengal and the Punjab. In Sind a new Ministry has recently been formed—the fourth in four years—under the Premiership of Khan Bahadur Allah Bux, who was Premier from March 1938 to March 1940. Throughout British India and the States conditions are tranquil. The combined operations in north Waziristan to which reference was made in the last Appreciation have been brought to a successful conclusion; and at the moment both north and south Waziristan are unusually quiet. There have been rumours of communication between enemy Legations in Kabul and the Faqir of Ipi and of the latter’s intention to stir up trouble on a large scale. Though communication has certainly been established, there has so far been little evidence of Ipi preparing for anything more than the usual operations by comparatively small gangs of disaffected tribes men.[Confidential. J APPEECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. Ao. 4 of the 1941 Series, April 18th, 1941- India and the War .—The pleasure caused by our successes by land in Abyssinia and Eritrea (where Indian troops earned special commendation from Mr. Churchill), and at sea in the Mediterranean, has been sobered by the advance of the enemy into Greece and Yugoslavia and the raid which has brought them again to the borders of Egypt. The change of government in Iraq also is an unwelcome sign of the strength of Axis influence in the east. Nevertheless after nineteen months of war India presents a surface of serenity and well-being, chequered but not seriously marred by some political disaffec tion, communal strife here and there, and a stirring from time to time on the North-West Frontier; all forms of war effort proceed apace; and confidence in victory is well maintained. The aims of the Eastern Group Supply Council have been described to the Press by members of the Council. The fundamental policy of the Eastern Group Conference was that war supplies for troops in the whole Eastern Group area should be drawn as far as possible from the Group’s own industrial capacity; and the Council has been formed to enable that policy to be carried out smoothly and with the least possible drain on shipping; the Council links up the Governments concerned so that they can conveniently operate through the medium of a body in constant session. India is likely to be called upon to supply up to her utmost capacity in the production of war material, and there will be no limiting of her industrial activity; since the first consideration in allocating orders will be ease and speed of supply and saving of shipping, India obviously has great strategical and geographical advantages. 2. Political .—The Indian situation has lately been described from England in a widely circulated newsletter as unsatisfactory and disquieting. There is no real justification for this phrase. It is true that in the political field the parties still show no disposition towards that national unity which would both reflect and enhance the country’s effort in aid of the prosecution of the war; but political differences, however deplorable, have a quite limited effect on the daily life of the people in general and on the war -effort in particular. Mr. Gandhi’s campaign against the Government has now entered a phase in which all members of Congress are eligible for law-breaking; but there is no sign of a considerable increase in the number of offenders except in one Province, and the campaign can fairly be described as futile. The Hindu Mahasabha, which at the end of December threatened to resort to2 “direct action” if the British Government did not by March 31st satisfy certain demands, has not carried its threat into effect. The Muslim League, meeting in annual session at Madras, has repeated its vehement denunciation of Congress pretensions to power, and has now placed in the forefront of its constitution the demand for the separation of India into Muslim and non- Muslim portions. In these circumstances it is difficult to see how the “national government” which the conference of Liberals at Bombay desired a month ago could come into being. 3. General .—trade between India and Burma ended with the sign ing on April 3rd of a trade agreement between the two countries. Both Governments are now at liberty to impose tariff duties subject to the reciprocal concession that their general tariff rates will give preference to goods of India or Burma, as the case may be, of 10% against Empire goods and 15% against foreign goods. The public peace has been nowhere seriously disturbed except in Dacca in east Bengal. Rioting in that city between Hindus and Muslims on March 19th necessitated the calling out of troops; the trouble spread to rural areas, and order was not restored for several days and until a number of lives had been lost. On the frontier the past month has been a time of uneasy quiet, though hostile gangs have been active in various parts of Waziristan. There are persistent rumours that the Faqir of Ipi is contemplating an organised rising, but at present the tribesmen do not show much inclination for hostilities on a large scale against Government; increased tension may be expected when the crops are harvested.1 Gopy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No, 5 of 1941 , which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded for your Information, with the compliments qf the Secretary to the G-overnor-G-eneral (Public), New Djelh i &lt; the 29th May 1941- To Major R.G.E.W.

India and the War.—The success of tlie enemy in rapidly overrunning Yugoslavia and Greece and in occupying islands in Aegean, and the with drawal of the Imperial forces from Greece, gave rise to anxiety in India which has increased with the fighting in Iraq and the signs^ that Germany will make use of Syria in the drive eastwards. dhe conflict^ in Iraq is^ specially disturbing to Indian Muslims, and the enemy wireless is assiduous in using it to depict Britain as the oppressor of Islam. Indian Muslim opinion as a whole is as yet unformed and there is a disposition to wait on events. But while those interested in promoting disaffection are making the most of the incident, there has been outspoken condemnation of Rashid Ali in other quarters, for instance, by the Nizam of Hyderabad and other Muslim Rulers. It must be expected that anxiety will continue so long as the Middle East is embroiled in the 'war, and will deepen if the threat comes neaier India. But at present the spirit of all classes and communities is generally steady,^ and there have been few signs of the nervousness which prevailed for a while in the crisis of last year. 2. Political —On April 22nd Parliament approved the continuance in force for a further year in the seven “ Congress ^ Provinces of the Proclama tion under Section 93 (the &lt;l breakdown 5 * provision) of the Constitution Act. This step was inevitable, as Congress is still engaged in organised (though languid and futile) law-breaking, and other parties in these Provinces are still unable to command majorities in the Eegislatures. It was not to be expected that Mr. Amery’s speeches in the House of Commons on this occasion should please nationalist sentiment in India. Congressmen (including Mr. Gandhi, whose comment was angry and incoherent) resent mention of communal differences and of the futility of the Congress programme ; and the Hindu leaders who organised the Bombay Conference (see March Appreciation) have retorted with some heat to Mr. Amery’s damaging analysis of their demands. But Mr. Jinnah’s criticism of these have caused even more intemperate controversy; and the nett result of the Bombay Conference is less a contribution to the solving of the political deadlock than a further exposure of the lack of unity in India which is the main cause of it. 3. Public Order —0£ this lack of unity, and of a worsening of communal relations, there have been demonstrations in several parts of the country. There was a recrudescence of the rioting in the Dacca neighbourhood, mentioned in the last Appreciation, and considerable loss of life and damage to property was suffered before peace was restored. Of other communal riots in various places, the most serious have been at Ahmedabad (Bombay Presidency) where 70 persons were killed, and in an area in Bihar. In both places much property was burnt and otherwise damaged. Both Muslims and non-Muslims must be held responsible for these outbreaks. Apart from these incidents the tranquillity of the country has been preserved. In Waziristan the operations of hostile gangs were met by immediate action and subsided towards the end of April; but reports persist that the Eaqir of Ipi intends to embark on widespread hostilities in the near future. r&lt;\ \ \ '7 Oonf i dential, - ( 1 '*« 1 Copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No, 6 of 19 41 ? which has been prepared for comunication to the Dominions, forwarded for your anformation with the compliments of the Secretary to the Governor-General (Public)* New Delh i, the 4th JUly 19 41. Major R.G.E.W.Alban, O.B.E., His Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain,[Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 6 of the 1941 Series, June 21st, 1941. India and the War .—The news of Rashid Ali’s flight from Iraq and of the conclusion of an armistice there has been received with general satisfac tion and relief, the latter not least in responsible Muslim circles. Uneasiness among Muslims about warlike operations in the territory of an Islamic State had undoubtedly been growing, even though slowly, and was being fanned by extremists, some inspired by genuine religious bias but the majority seek ing to turn to their own advantage the opportunity of playing on the fanaticism of the ignorant masses. The rapid restoration of order has averted this danger. Although all Muslim leaders of any standing were well aware that the real danger to Islam lay in German penetration into Iraq, many of them were evidently afraid of the possible effects of an * agitation based on Islamic sentiment. Mr. Jinnah and the Muslim League had therefore preferred for tactical reasons to sit on the fence and avoid declaring their attitude. The collapse of Rashid Ali has freed them from the possible embarrassment of having to do so if circumstances or the demands of their followers for a lead had forced them. The success in Iraq softened to some extent the effects of the simultaneous loss of Crete; but in India as elsewhere the Cretan reverse increased for a time the number of doubters in final victory and of believers in the invincibility on land of the German forces. Mr. Churchill’s speech has done something to restore a better sense of proportion; and the advance of the allied forces into Syria has won general approval, and is having a reassuring effect throughout India. The feeling that the tide of war has come distinctly nearer to India’s shores is shown in an increased demand for A.R.P. measures, particularly in the Western area. The improvement of the civic guards (see the Appreciation for June 1940) is also receiving attention from every Provincial Government. The membership of this organization now exceeds 60,000; and on a number of occasions in tne past year they have shown their value as helpers of the regular police. Improvement has recently been remarked in the quality of candidates coming forward for emergency commissions. In pursuance of a promise made by the Commander-in-Chie'f during the last session of the Council of State, it has been decided to set up a Committee of ten members of the Central Legislature to advise on defence matters for the purpose of maintaining closer touch with non-official opinion in the country. It has also been decided to appoint an official Committee to deal with the problem of post-war industrial reconstruction. * *2. Political .—The lull in political activity continues. The sense, of frustration and of failure in Hindu and Nationalist political circles finds expression in somewhat peevish recriminations, both in speeches and in the Press, directed chiefly at the British Government and also at the Muslim League. The lost opportunities and the mistakes of policy by which their leaders have deprived them of a share in the government of the country and in the responsibility for its defence are regretted, but seldom publicly admitted. A slight stir was caused by the declaration of the Duke of Devonshire, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for India, at Leeds on May 30th that the Government of India should be carried on £ ‘by India for India in India”, and not from Whitehall; but it was soon realized that this was no more than a repetition of what has been the declared long-term policy of His Majesty’s Government for some years. A well-meaning attempt by Miss Eleanor Rathbone, m.p., to convince Congressmen that to resist the war effort at this critical hour was to render disservice to India provoked a bitter and unbalanced reply from Rabindranath Tagore. The civil disobedience movement remains stagnant. The release of about 300 Satyagrahis in the Punjab as a result of a judicial decision that merely to give notice of an intention to commit Satyagraha doss not constitute an offence has signally failed to revive the movement in that Province; in Bihar about half the persons on the lists approved by Gandhi have failed to perform Satyagraha; and in the United Provinces, where the movement has oeen more vigorous than elsewhere, there has been a steady lessening of enthusiasm. Recent communal riots, particularly those in Ahmedabad, a great Congress stronghold, have given occasion for much heart-searching on the part of Congressmen and have so much shaken their faith in £ 'non violence” as a practicable policv that even Gandhi has had to issue a rather casuistical statement by which those weaker brethren who cannot achieve the non-violent technique of resistance are encouraged to resist evil violently rather than to flee from it. The Muslim League has been more concerned with separationist propaganda in favour of “Pakistan” (and with Iraq behind the scenes) than with current internal politics. A significant event is the reappointment by Jinnah of the Premiers of the Punjab and Bengal to the League Working Committee, despite their thinly disguised dissent from his Pakistan policy. The claim of the League to represent Muslim opinion throughout the country and so to be entitled to a more powerful voice in the Government depends entirely on maintaining a united front, and therefore entails keep ing the allegiance of the Governments of the two chief Muslim Provinces. The All-India Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha in a meeting held on June 15th at Calcutta decided by a substantial majority to postpone giving effect to the Madura resolution threatening “direct action” (see Apprecia tions 1 and 4 of 1941).3 3. General. The last reference to the organization of Muslim k. nowr f as fte Khaksars will be found in Appreciation No. 6 of ylU. During the past year, this body, though potentially dangerous, had not given much trouble and had been mainly occupied in sporadic and unsuccess!ul negotiations for the restoration of their leader to liberty. But a p an that bodies of Khaksars should on June 6th occupy certain mosques m Delhi Lahore, Peshawar and elsewhere and convert them into bases of organized and unlawful agitation for the release of their leader, caused the b-overnment of India to decide that the association should be declared unlawful throughout India. The decision has provoked little adverse comment, and has (naturally) been welcomed in the Hindu press. The necessary measures to enforce it have so far been carried out without difficulty and with very little opposition, and firm and timely action appears to have prevented what might have become a troublesome and dangerous movement. au incidents have continued to occur in Bombay City and Anmedabad, but the unexpectedly early arrival of the monsoon there may nelp to cjilin the feelings of both communities. Elsewhere, public order is undisturbed, but factory labour, which has been remarkably untroubled during the past year, is showing signs of unrest, particularly in the textile industry m the Central Provinces and Bombay, and the demand for allowances to compensate for the rise in the cost of living—a demand which as already been widely met both in Government and non-Government employment—may be expected to increase. On the North-West Frontier, there were indications that the Faqir or Ipi s threatened offensive was about to begin, but pressure was brought to bear on dissident elements with substantial results; and the general situa tion there is now more encouraging than it has been for some time past.Do nfidential 1 Copy of the o.ppreciation of the politics,! situa.tiorl in India No, 7 of 19 41 , which has been prepared fob _ communication to the Dominions* forwarded for your information vdth the compliments of the Secretary to the G-overnor-G-eheral (Public) * 31st July 19 41. mjor R.G.E.W. Alban. O.B.E.. Political Agent, Bahrein*[Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 7 of the 1941 series, July 19th, 1941. India and the War .—The news of the Turko-German pact was followed so closely by the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Russia that Indian opinion on the pact had little time to declare itself; but Muslims generally regretted the course which prudence had dictated to Turkey, while nationalist Hindus professed to find in the pact evidence of a growth of understanding between Germany and Islam, Germany’s attack on Russia on Sunday, June 22nd, took India by surprise. At first there was a general feeling of relief, expressed in terms which showeT slight understanding of £he Ihcfeasecl’ ‘danger to India from the enormous weight of the German arms being thrown eastwards. Among Muslims, who remember the treatment of Islam in the U.S.S.R. and in some other quarters also there was lit tle enthusiasm for an alliance between Britain and Russia; but the discriminat ing terms of Mr. ChurchiH’s broadcast which promised all possible help to Russia as the enemy of Germany have been welcomed almost everywhere. The effect which the addition of Russia to our allies may have on the principal parties in India is not yet clear; but it may be expected that the left section of Congress will (from a new motive) show increased impatience with Mr. Gandhi’s leadership in the wilderness of non-violence. Though the more vehement communists and socialists still profess to distrust British motives and intentions, whether towards Russia or towards India, there is a numerous section which favours support for the war effort now that it is sanctified by the Russian connection. The conflict in Russia has thrown the Syrian campaign into the shade. There was some criticism of the slowness of the advance in Syria, but this has been silenced by the sudden collapse of the French resist ance; and the part played by Indian units in the campaign is appreciated. 2. In India itself, the appointment of General Waved as Commander- in-Chief in place of General Auchinleck has been received with mixed feelings and lively speculation. While General Auchinleck had stirred Indian sympathies in a remarkable degree, regret at his departure is tempered by appreciation of the gain to India at this critical time of a succeaa o£ so experienced in the conduct of the war. India has received from the Govern ment of the Sudan a most generous contribution of £100,000 in recognition of the gallantry of Indian troops in the defence of the Sudan. The Defence Advisory Committee of the Legislature, mentioned in the last Appreciation,2 will not contain a representative of the Muslim League, as Mr. Jinnah, true to form, has declined to nominate a member, on the ground that the League cannot be expected to tender advice in matters of vital importance to India so long as it has no responsibility and voice in the authority of the Govern ment. The increasing volume of supplies coming to India from the U.S.A. has led to the formation of an Indian purchasing mission in the United States; its functions will include the securing of shipping and other export facilities from America to India, and of priority for the Government of India’s orders. The scheme for the training of technicians in India, which is expected to provide 15,000 trained men by the end of March 1942, is to be assisted by the despatch of 100 instructors from Great Britain; nearly 6,000 men are already being trained at 87 centres throughout the country and 104 more centres are ready to receive a further 6,000. The continued expansion of the Royal Indian Navy was recently marked by the launching of a trawler, designed for mine-sweeping and submarine-chasing, of which only the engine and the boiler were not made in India. 3. Political .—The main political parties in India are making no contri bution to the country’s true interests. Standing aloof both from the war, which more and more occupies the attention of the people, and from any practical steps towards unity and constitutional advance in India, they are all suffering damage from the sterility of their programmes. Though Mr. Gandhi’s influence still holds together the diverse elements which profess allegiance to the Congress, unwillingness to perform satvagraha increases, and there have lately been some significant defections from the party. The most notable is that of Mr. Munshi, formerly Home Minister in Bombay, whose professed reason for leaving the Congress is disagreement with Mr. Gandhi’s doctrine of non-violence as the shield and buckler of Hindus in communal riots. It might almost be said that among the organised parties the only live issue is the communal one; while the unorganised Liberals continue to urge the mobilisation of India’s goodwill for the prosecution of the war in terms that ignore actual difficulties. The announcement of an appointment which creates a vacancy in the Viceroy’s Executive Council has heightened popular expectation that the Council is shortly to be expanded. It is remarkable with what zeal circles w hich b y their own professions should be little interested in a mere increase in the number of Indian non-officials in the Council are speculating on names and offices. 4. General .—The arrival of the monsoon has brought some easing of the communal tension; but in Dacca rioting again broke out on June 26th, and the committee which had just begun its enquiry into the riots of March-April has had for that reason to suspend its work.I I 3 A threat of a general strike in the textile industry in the Central Jrrovmces has been averted by the decision of the Provincial Government to appomt a committee to examine the level of wages and other conditions in the industry. Negotiations between an official delegation of the Government of India and the Government of Burma on the difficult question of Indian immigration into Burma resulted on June 29th in an agreement which is now under the consideration of the Government of India. On the Frontier, the situation again deteriorated in the Tochi Valley, and troops have been despatched to punish offending villages and restore communications. The improvement in South Waziristan has been maintained.Confidential Copy of the appreciation of the political situation in series India No. 8 of 19 41 ,/which has been prepared for communication to the hominionsj forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the G-overnor G-enera.1 (Public). &lt;L New Delhi . the 5th September 1941.

Indiaand the War .—The war in Russia has been the main interest of the month. The strength of the German onslaught is now appreciated; but it is felt that the enemy s successes have been bought at a cost in men, materials, and time which may prove crippling. India is specially interested in the possibility of a German drive through Turkey; and, still nearer home, the infection of Iran by the customary German methods has been noted with anxiety. Japan s bullying tactics in the east have aroused comparatively l[ttie fear of danger to India. Public opinion does not regard her record in the war with China as making her formidable against the strengthened defences of Malaya and Burma. The prompt economic retaliation of Great Britain and the United States has been generally welcomed, though the cessation of trade between Japan and India will have far-reaching effects. Japanese businessmen in India seem to have been taken by surprise both by Japan’s action and by our counteraction; and are reported to be preparing for early departure. In various ways India has been taking the precautions which experience elsewhere has shown to be necessary against enemy action. A War Injuries Ordinance, issued on July 25th, empowers the Central Government to make provision for payment of relief in respect of war injuries sustained by gainfully ^occupied persons and for service injuries sustained by civil defence volunteers; and relieves employers of legal liability to 1 grant compensation to their employees in respect of such injuries. The Central Government have also brought rationing of petrol into effect from August 15th. The main object is to build up reserves; essential services will be maintained and private consumers will be allowed a moderate ration; a reduction of 20 % in the total monthly petrol consumption in India of about 10 million gallons is expected. Indian Army casualties during the campaign in Africa from December' to July 8th have recently been announced. They totalled 6,427, of which only a small percentage were fatal. During this period the casualties inflicted on the enemy were at least 213,000 in the first Western Desert campaign, the Sudan, and Eritrea alone. 2. Political .—On July 21st, an important announcement was made of the expansion of the Viceroy’s Executive Council and the formation of a National Defence Council. So long ago as November 1939 the intention of His Majesty’s Government had been declared of bringing by these means the2 political parties and other interests into closer association with the prosecu tion of the war. Though the party leaders held back, the announcement of August 8th 1940 reaffirmed the Government’s intention, and waived the requirement (as regards the expansion of the Viceroy’s Council) of prior agreement in the provincial field between the major political parties. On November 20th the Viceroy announced with regret that the offer could not be implemented as those parties refused to accept their opportunity; but the offer would still be open if a sufficient degree of representative support were forthcoming. The steps now taken have for their purpose the more efficient government of a country at war; they are within the framework of the exist ing constitution and in no way prejudice the future constitutional settlement. Eight portfolios out of twelve will be held by Indian members, and these will include subjects of such special importance for the prosecution of the war as Supply, Commerce, Labour, Information, and Civil Defence. For the first time the Viceroy’s Council will be predominantly Indian and non-official. The National Defence Council is to consist of 22 members from British India, including, by virtue of their office, the Premiers of the four Ministerial P]'ovinces, and nine representatives of Indian States. The members of this body have been selected so as to represent not only territorial areas but also various interests, functions and communities; only one of the members appointed is a European. The Council will meet about once every two months undei the Chairmanship of the Viceroy, and will act as a link between the central and provincial war efforts; it will receive full and confidential state ments of the war position and of the position in regard to supply, and the members will in turn put forward their own suggestions. In announcing these changes in the House of Commons, the Secretary of State claimed that the new members of the Executive Council are as representative of public opinion, and as responsive to it, as is possible in face of the refusal of Congress and the Muslim League to co-operate. The aim, he said, is to make full use of the vast and hitherto insufficiently tapped reservoir of Indian ability and patriotism; measures marking a change in the spirit if not the letter of India’s constitution were an earnest of the desire of His Majesty’s Government to transfer to Indian hands a steadily increasing share in India’s destiny. These measures have naturally been received with disfavour by the leaders of the Congress and the Muslim League; the president of the Hindu Maha- sabha has described them as a step in the right direction, though belated and halting. In general, criticism has sought to suggest that the portfolios entrusted to Indian hands in the Viceroy’s Council are less important thnn those retained by the British members. Even the most captious criticism, however, has refrained from any attempt to depreciate the outstanding merits of the persons now appointed to the two Councils.3 These changes have been discussed in both Houses of Parliament. The opportunity in the Lords was taken in the debate on the India and Burma Postponement of Elections Bill, the purpose of which, as regards India, is to postpone the obligation to hold elections to provincial Assemblies (only four of which out of eleven are in fact working). Under the existing statute the elections would be due in 1942 at the latest; the proposed amendment extends the maximum life of the present Assemblies to twelve months after the end of the war. The power of Governors to dissolve them earlier, if necessary, is not affected. The reasons for the proposal, including the desire to avoid giving occasion for increased communal dissension, seem to be fairly well appreciated in India. The “non-party 55 politicians, whose meeting last March was mentioned in the Appreciation for that month, held another conference at the end of July. Two resolutions were passed, one reaffirming the demands previously made, and the other authorising the president, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, to initiate the examination of the main lines on which future constitutional changes should be based, with a view to ensuring and preserving the unity and integrity of India. ™ Mr. Jinnah has chosen to confront the Muslim League with a crisis, on account of the acceptance by some of its prominent members of appointments to the Executive Council and the National Defence Council. Mr. Jinnah, who has prejudged the issue by denouncing their conduct, has summoned a meeting of the working committee of the League to consider it. As three of the offenders are Premiers of Provinces, the decisions to be taken on August 24th may be of more than merely party interest. 3. General .—The partial failure of the monsoon over large areas, though remedied to some extent by recent rains, may make relief measures necessary in some Provinces in the coming cold weather. Prices have risen sharply in some places. Their trend is under constant observation by the Central and Provincial Governments; and where labour is affected care is taken to see that wages are adjusted. In consequence, little scope has been given for labour grievances, whether genuine or artificial; and when unrest has appeared, as in Cawnpore in the latter part of July, it has quickly subsided. Communal tension is, as usual, easier during the monsoon, and there has been no serious disturbance of the peace during the past month. For once, all communities spoke with a united voice in mourning the death of Rabindranath Tagore, who by his life and work brought renown to India in the eyes of the world. The agreement to regulate Indian immigration into Burma, mentioned in the last Appreciation, was published on July 21st, and will come into effect fM 4 on October 1st. It is based on the recognition of two principles: that Burma has the right to determine the composition of her own population; and that Indians who have wholly identified themselves with the interests of Burma should enjoy the same rights as members of the permanent population. On the Frontier, the recalcitrant tribes in the Tochi Valley have now made submission, and troops are being withdrawn after completing selected demolitions in offending villages. South Waziristan remains steady.« « /CnX u I H nnfi dent 1.41 1 Copy of the Appreciation of the political situation in India No. 9 of 19 41 j which has been prepared for conmunication to the Dominions* forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary tb the Govenhoir General (Public).

No. 9 of the 1941 Series, September 20th, 1941- India and the War .—The steps taken by Britain and Russia to prevent Iran from passing under the control of the enemy have been watched from India with close attention. The general feeling is of relief and approval. Among Muslims there was some anxiety, suspicion, and even resentment: this was fostered by political mischief-making and might have caused unrest if Iran had resisted the demands of the allies. The Working Committee of the Muslim League happened to be sitting, and in a mood hostile to His Majesty’s Government, when the allied action began; it passed an intemperate resolution about Britain’s behaviour towards “certain Muslim States”; and described the entry into Iran in particular as unprovoked aggression, which § would result in the withdrawal of all Indian Muslim help to the allied cause. The press in India was advised not to publish these statements; and Mr. Jinnah’s hope of using the Iranian incident as a weapon in his new feud with the Government has not as yet been realised. On the second anniversary of the war both the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief spoke on All-India Radio. The Viceroy extolled the material achievements, and the fine spirit, of India s soldiers, Princes, and people. “India is awake; she is mighty and formidable: and she shall, if you so determine, be mighter yet”. General Wavell told of the great increase of India’s armed power during the last year: the total of her fighting forces was now approaching one million, with well over 100,000 serving overseas and so protecting the country from the horrors of invasion and bombing. India’s representative on the Eastern Group Supply Council, in a review of the countrv’s contribution towards the Empire s war supplies, mentioned that India already produces about 75 per cent, of the many thousands of articles grouped under the term “war requirements”; and that during the seven months of the Council’s existence capacity had been found in India for about 400 items which it had been stated previously that she could not produce. His Majesty’s Government have recently agreed to a standing arrange ment under which India will receive a substantial fixed pioportion of the output of the United Kingdom; as a result, steady supplies of all kinds of equipment unobtainable in India are now forthcoming and will enable India to push forward with the modernisation of her normal defence garrisons and with the equipment of the forces now being raised on a scale adapted to the requirements of modern war.i 2 India’s interest in the Atlantic Charter has been directed mainly to the clause which declares that the national policies of the United Kingdom and the United States respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live. The application of this principle to India has been made clear by Mr. Churchill’s statement in the House of Commons on September 9th. He said that the joint declaration does not qualify in any way the various statements of policy which had been made from time to time about the development of constitutional government in India, Burma, or other parts of the British Empire. By the declaration of August 1940, Great Britain had promised to help India to obtain free and equal partnership in the British Commonwealth, subject to the fulfilment of the obligations arising from Britain’s long connection with India and her responsibilities to India’s many creeds, races and interests. At the Altantic meeting the problems of the countries now under the Nazi yoke had been primarily in mind; those were quite separate from the progressive evolution of self-governing institutions in the British Empire. The Govern ment’s declarations on the latter, complete in themselves, unambiguous, and related to the circumstances of the territories and peoples affected, would be found h) be entirely in harmony with the conception of freedom and justice which inspired the joint declaration. In political circles in India this state ment has been ill received; and hostile criticism has perversely interpreted it as proof that Indians and the subject peoples in the Empire cannot hope to receive the benefit of principles applicable to other races. 2. Political .—The meeting (above-mentioned) of the Working Committee of the Muslim League was convened at Bombay on August 24th to consider the conduct of the members of the League who had accepted appointments to the Viceroy’s Executive Council and the National Defence Council. Mr. Jinnah, in order to prove that their selection was designed to injure the League, has made great play with a remark of Mr. Amery’s in the Commons debate of August 1st, which expressed pleasure that patriotic Indians, regardless of party leaders and in defiance of party discipline had come forward to work for India’s defence. At the Working Committee meeting he produced a fresh grievance in a message from the Viceroy sent to him, as a matter of courtesy, on the eve of the public announcement of the appointments. Mr. Jinnah professed to believe that the description therein of the Premiers of the four Ministerial Provinces as representatives of the Muslim community disproved the plain truth that they had been appointed as Premiers, and gave him the right to require their resignation This quibble served its turn; the Committee resolved accordingly, and the three Premiers who belong to the League have resigned from the National Defence Council. The Bengal Premier, however, has made it clear that he is taking this step against his better judgment and in order to preserve Muslim1 3 V solidarity; and he has at the same time resigned his membership of the Working Committee and Council of the League in protest against the President’s arrogant and dictatorial conduct. The new Law Member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, and the only woman appointed to the National Defence Council, have refused to obey the command to resign their respective appointments; and they have been expelled from the League for five years. Mr. Jinnah’s subjugation of the Premiers has the effect, for the time being, of depriving three of the four predominantly Muslim Provinces of authoritative representation in the war-effort which all these Provinces are pledged to support. The paradoxes of Indian politics are further illustrated by the direction issued to the Congress Party in the Sind Legislature by the Congress President from jail (where he is serving a sentence for a speech made in furtherance of Mr. Gandhi’s campaign against the war-effort) that they should support the Premier (a Muslim, though not a member of the Muslim League) who has refused to resign his appointment to the Defence Council. Mr. Gandhi’s campaign grows feebler daily; very few of the satyagrahis who have served their original sentences have obeyed the order to repeat their offence; and the growing volume of discontent with the futility of the programme is beginning to find vent in open criticism and some secessions. But the Mahatma is unmoved, and the habit of blind obedience still prevents any important revolt. 3. General .—There has been much criticism of the Indo-Burma Immigration Agreement, mentioned in the last two Appreciations. The critics (who include Mr. Gandhi) find fault both with the terms of the agree ment and with the manner of its conclusion before publication. So far as the merits go, criticism shows little recognition of any point of view but the Indian. On the Frontier the successful punitive operation in the Tochi Valley and the consequent diminution of the Faqir of Ipi’s prestige have resulted in a period of unusual quiet in Waziristan. The operations in Iran have failed to arouse more than minor interest among the frontier tribes, though the main Shia tribe in the Kurram Valley expressed gratification at the joint Anglo-Russian action.n onfidential 1 Copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No, 10 of 19 41 , which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the G-overnor G-eneral (Public), New Delhi,the 50th October 19 41, \i n- A'' a O/h Ma ior A .0 .3, Alban, O.B.D., Political Agent Bahrain\7 7 \ [Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 10 of the 19^1 Series, October 17th, 1941. India and the War .—The intervention of Britain and Russia in Iran is now generally accepted in India as a measure which gives India greater security. The abdication of the Shah has been described by mischief-makers as forced by the Allies; and some Provincial branches of the Muslim League have followed the example of the Working Committee of that body, mentioned in the last Appreciation, in passing resolutions which blame Britain for recent events in Iran. But there is little genuine feeling among Indian Muslims about that country; they are more interested in the policy and fate of Turkey; and at the moment events in the Middle East are over- ^ shadowed by the plight of Russia, where the German advance threatens not only Moscow but the road to the Caucasus. Air defence manoeuvres in North-West India on a scale never previously attempted in this country have just ended. They included the bombing of strategic points, the landing of para-troops, and the activities of “fifth- columnists”. The co-operation of the public was satisfactory. The first session of the National Defence Council was held in Simla from October 6th to 8th, with the Viceroy presiding. The vacancies caused by the resignations of the Premiers of Assam, Bengal, and the Punjab have not been filled. A message from Mr. Churchill paid tribute to the important and distinguished part played by Indian troops who “have already in this war shown themselves worthy of the highest respect and honour among military men”, and who in 1942 with their British comrades will be fight ing on the long front from the Caspian to the Nile and so barring the east ward progress of the war to the plains of Hindustan. The Commander-in- Chief, just, returned from his visits to London, Cairo and Teheran, gave an account of the present situation in the war. The discussions covered the subjects of supply, recruitment, civil defence and A.R.P., war propaganda, defence loans, and price control. Political .—The extension of Lord Linlithgow’s term of office for a further year from April 1942 has naturally disappointed those who hoped for some remarkable change in British policy towards India; nationalist newspapers, after excited speculation as to his successor, profess that under the present constitution it is a matter of indifference to India who stands at the head of the administration.2 Misrepi’esentation continues of Mr. Churchill 5 s statement of September 9th (quoted in the last Appreciation) about the relation of the Atlantic Charter 55 to India. Referring to doubts expressed, on the subject by the Premier of the Punjab, Mr. Amery in the House of Commons on Octobei 9th re-stated the obvious meaning of that pronouncement. Many important Congressmen, including most of the members of the Working Committee, have now been released from prison on the expiry of the sentences incurred for the token law-breaking ordained by Mr. Gandhi. Mr. Gandhi’s requirement that the law shall be broken again and again has not been modified; but none of the leaders has shown any disposition to comply with .it. Though no one expects the Mahatma to abandon his mam programme, some Congress members of the Central Legislative Assembly are hoping that he will permit them to attend the session which begins on October 27th, if only in order to damn the Indo-Burma Immigration Agree ment. Mr. Jinnah has summoned the Council of the Muslim League to meet at Delhi just before the Assembly session; the outcome will be of interest, as the proceedings of the last meeting of the Working Committee (described in the last Appreciation) will come under review. General .—The occurrence of important Hindu festivals during the month of Ramzan might., in the present state of communal feeling have caused serious disturbances; but such breaches of the peace as have taken place, e.g., in Bengal and the Central Provinces, have been of only local importance. Waziristan still presents an appearance of unaccustomed tranquillity, partly on account of Ramzan. But the Axis Powers have continued to maintain their contacts with the Faqir of Ipi, on whom they count to organize fresh and more widespread tribal hostility; and the suggestion is being fostered all along the Frontier that the British and Soviet Govern ments will shortly treat Afghanistan as they have treated Iran. War conditions are not preventing Government from affording due facilities for the Haj pilgrimage; the first pilgrin^hip to the Hedjaz will sail as soon as Ramzan is over. Urgent demands for wheat from the Middle East temporarily depleted Indian stocks, and led to a steep rise in prices; the Government of India therefore decided to reduce the wheat import duty by 90 per cent. The general upward trend of prices in most Provinces has given rise to some anxiety, and the subject is being discussed at a Conference convened at Delhi on October 16th.Confidential r t 1 Copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. 11 of 1941 ? which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the G-overnor G-eneral (Public).

No. 11 of the 1941 Series, November 20th, 1941. India and the War .—The course of the war in Russia has wiped out the easy optimism which was prevalent in India for a while after the German invasion began. The depression caused by the enemy's successes has been somewhat relieved by his failure to capture Leningrad and Moscow; but the approach to the Caucasus through the Ukraine and the Crimea is being anxiously watched, and there are questionings, echoed from accounts of what has been said and written in the United Kingdom, of the adequacy of the assistance rendered to Russia. Increased attention is paid to enemy wireless at such times; but there are no signs of panic, and on the whole it may be said that, though the prospect of victory for the Allied arms has somewhat receded, confidence in its ultimate achievement is maintained. The momentum of the war effort grows in every respect; and pleasure is taken in occasions, such as the recent formal presentation by the Viceroy in New Delhi of two Victoria Crosses won by Indians, which illustrate the great part played in the war by Indian forces. Events in Russia put other foreign news in the shade. But there is now general acquiescence (subject to what is said below of the attitude of the Muslim League) in the events which have given the Allies a footing and a causeway in Persia. The expulsion of Germans and Italians from Afghanistan has been scaiceh noticed, on the Frontier or elsewhere; but hostile propaganda still seeks to make mischief bv prophecies that Afghanistan will be invaded. Confidence in our defences in the Far East, and in the policy of the United States of America, mainly explains the slight attention paid to the posturing of Japan. Political .—By the middle of October the expansion of the Viceroy’s Executive Council (see the Appreciation for August) was completed. The first deliberations have coincided with a ferment in political circles, especially in the Congress and Muslim League camps. Nearly all the Congress leaders have now been released on completing their sentences, and have been dis cussing the situation The majority are known to favour a change from Mr. Gandhi’s depressing programme which requires repeated Satyagraha and courting of imprisonment by his more devoted followers and incessant spinning!' and good works bv the rank and file. In particular, the Congress members of the Central Assembly, who were permitted to attend one day of the session (but not to take part in the proceedings) to avoid forfeiting their seats, strongly desire a resumption of Parliamentary activity. But Mr. Gandhi, whose vigour is unimpaired by age—he recently celebrated his 72nd birthdav—will not yield; in a long statement issued at the end of October he has answered his Congress critics and repeated his complete faith in his policy; and none of bis followers yet dares to lead a revolt against his authority The Council (a body of some hundreds) of the Muslim League met on the eve of the opening of the Assembly session, and endorsed the decisions made by the Working Committee in August (described in the September Appreciation). On the subject of Iran in particular, and Islamic countries in general, a resolution was passed in violent language which, like the resolutions of last August, has been denied publicity. The expansion of the Viceroy’« Executive Council, and the establishment of the National Defence Council, were once more condemned as designed to create a rift in the Muslim ranks; and Mr. Jinnah, after making an unimpressive state ment in the Assembly on the second day of the session, announced that his party would boycott the proceedings, and led his followers out. This imita tion of tactics which Congressmen introduced but would now be glad to abandon is no more effective than original; and the proceedings of both Chambers of the Legislature in spite of so many empty benches in the2 Assembly, have held the attentioB, of the country. while such impoitaiiu subjects as the relation of the “Atlantic Charter to India, and the negotia tions with Burma and Ceylon on Indian immigration into those countries, have been handled by the new spokesmen of Government. Another matter which has come to the fore, in the Assembly and outside, is the treatment of “political” prisoners; These fall mainly into two classes—- seem it} prisoners, detained without trial on account of subversive activities, of whom the majority are communists: and satyagrains, who have been con victed for offering civil disobedience. The more extreme security prisoners, over 200 in number are confined at a place called Deoli which is under the direct administration of the Central Government though the prisoners aie held under warrants issued by Provincial Governments. These prisoners went on hunger-strike at the end of October, their main demand being repatriation to their Provinces. Most of them broke their fast on Novemoer 8th; a remnant persists in the strike, demanding an assurance that on being returned to their Provinces they shall be treated as well as at Deoli. A resolution was moved in the Central Assembly on November 18th, iecom- mending that the Government of* India should take steps, in agreement with vy the Provincial Governments, for the immediate and unconditional release of all persons convicted, or detained without trial, for holding or expressing opinions prejudicial to the conduct of the war or for actions connected with industrial disputes. The Home Member (who, referring to demands for liberty of speech, made an appeal for liberty of thought as well) explained the difficulties in the way of immediate decision where the Provincial Governmentin circumstances varying from Province to Province, are closely concerned; and the resolution was withdrawn on his giving an assurance that the further consideration of the matter would proceed without unnecessary delay and in a sympathetic spirit.' Mr. Gandhi had chosen to announce beforehand that no decision to release satyagrahi prisoners would in the slightest degree influence him to abate the civil disobedience movement; it would in fact be the duty of released Congressmen to repeat their offences. General .—Communal trouble has continued at Dacca (Bengal), where the disturbances have gone on intermittently since last March. A revival of rioting in Bombay City at the end of October was quickly brought under control, and did not 'spread. ^ As a result mainly of the stoppage of the import of cotton textiles from Japan and of the reduced import from England, there ha.s been a large demand for the output of cotton textiles from Indian _ Mills. Without increased production there would be inadequate supplies at leasonable prices; and an increase in the weekly hours of work from 54 to 60 in all Mills throughout India is therefore being permitted, with payment of over time rates for the additional six hours. In Waziristan autumn is passing into winter with the country still Q generally tranquil and the Eaqir of IpTs prestige much diminished. Govern ment forces have attained one or two small successes recently and these ha've had an admirable effect.H onfidential 1 Copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. 12 of 19 41 , which has been prepared for communication to the bominionsj forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the G-overnor G-eneral (Public).

India and the War .—The course of the war has remarkably changed in the last month, with the British offensive in Libya, the turn of the tide in Russia, and the events of the first ten days of the war with Japan. In India, as elsewhere, too much was expected of the early stages of the Libyan battle; the scope of our successes there, and the part played in them by Indian troops, are now known and give ground for sober confidence. The Russian news has been loudly applauded. That from the Far East has caused dismay; and India watches with anxiety the pressure on Burma and Malaya. The more timorous residents of Calcutta have hastened to leave it, and elsewhere in the country also the sudden consciousness that the war is no longer far away has shaken weak nerves; but on the whole there is less alarm than might have been expected, and the accession of the United States to the allied front gives comfort and mitigates the shock of bad ne’vys. There is universal execration of Japan's treachery; and the fact that India is at war with Japan is everywhere accepted.without question. The second session of the National Defence. Council (see October Appreciation) was held in Delhi from December 1st to 3rd; all sides of the country’s war effort were discussed. It is now possible to say with some assurance that the Council has taken root, and that its value is well appre ciated. Its members, while on tour to various centres of the war effort, have sent a message to the Viceroy that they realise the gravity of the danger that has now reached the very door of India, and give an assurance of all possible support and of confidence that India will rise to the occasion in this grave emergency. The Viceroy in his annual speech to the Associated Chambers of Commerce in Calcutta on DccemBcr 15th, reviewed India's contribution to the successful prosecution of the war during the last twelve months. The number of fighting men defending India overseas had increased threefold in the past year and tenfold since December 1939; and India’s supply organisation had been brought to a pitch of performance which commands admiration. Political .—Though the Viceroy made the war the main theme of his speech, he also touched on political affairs. He described his expanded Executive Council as a strong, effective, and distinguished body; and he appealed for a, fresh attempt to bridge the divisions which still unhappily exist between the main political parties, and which prevent their co operation in the Government at the Centre and in six of the eleven Provinces.The last Appreciation mentioned the consideration being given to the treatment of “political” prisoners. The remnant of hunger-strikers at Deoli gave up their strike on November 22nd. On December 3rd the Government of India announced that all civil disobedience prisoners whose offences had been formal or symbolic in character would be set free as soon as possible; with them would be released also Maulana Abul Kalam Azad (President of the Congress) and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. This decision was welcomed by people of moderate views, who regarded it as largely due to the initiative of the new Members of the Viceroy’s Executive Council; in Congress circles it gave occasion for a demand for further concessions, particularly the release of all “security” prisoners. Congress leaders of the Gandhian persuasion maintain that it will make no difference to the programme of satyagraha; but the belief is general that at the Working Committee summoned to meet on December 23rd after being in abeyance for more than a year an influential section will press for an abandonment of that programme and a return to parliamentary activity and even for an offer (on terms) of sharing the duties and privileges of administration. Two of the three Provincial Premiers who professed allegiance to the Muslim League have (with their colleagues) lately resigned. In Assam, where the Premier could no longer command a majority, a new Ministry has not yet been formed. In Bengal differences between the Premier, Mr. Fazlul Huq, and his Muslim League colleagues have been much aggravated by Mr. Jinn ah’s attempt to repress the Premier’s independence of action; and in the outcome the League Ministers have passed into opposi tion while Mr. Fazlul Huq (now finally excommunicated from the League) has formed a coalition Ministry in which most of the other elements in the Assembly are represented. Thus he retains office, though the Ministry which he has led since April 1937 has fallen to pieces. The Muslim League, and Mr. Jinnah’s leadership of it, have certainly lost credit by these events. Of the seven Provinces which were deprived of Ministerial administra tion by the Congress High Command more than two years ago, one (Orissa) has now a Ministry once more. Seceders from the Congress have allied themselves with the old Opposition, and a Ministry has assumed office under the Maharaja of Parlakimedi as Premier. The new Ministries, both in Bengal and in Orissa, are pledged to support the war effort. General .—There has been a welcome respite in communal disturbances. There is ground for anxiety in the rise in prices of articles in common use or consumption. A recent riot in Madura (Madras), though not on a large scale, was significant in that the motive was looting of foodstuffs. On December 5th, the Central Government announced maximum rates for whole sale transactions in wheat, and removed the import duty. Unrest in ther 3 labour world, fairly widespread though nowhere alarming, is related to the rise m the cost of living. It is met from time to time by increase in wages or allowances. . , Th f North-West Frontier remains unusually quiet. Both Mohmand and Mahsud tribes have made declarations of loyalty to the British cause, the Mansuds backing up their declaration by presenting to the Governor of the Province a purse of Rs. 21,000 towards the war effort. The reaction of the irontier tribes to the expulsion of Axis subjects from Afghanistan may be escribed as one of relief that a difficult corner has been successfully negotiated. In spite of financial assistance from the Axis Legations at Knnul, the Faqir of Ipi has not yet been able to launch his long awaited offensive, and the advent of severe winter weather is now likely to retard ms efforts still further.I wm Confidential 1 Copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. 1 of 1942 , which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the G-overnor General (Public).

India and the War .—India is watching with increased anxiety the course of the war in the Far East; and good news from Russia and Cyrenaica does not count for much against alarming events nearer home. Exaggerated fears for the safety of India’s eastern coast have driven many thousands of people from Calcutta and other cities; fantastic rumours fly about; the weakness of the Far Eastern defences, especially in Malaya, has shaken confidence; and the arrival of Indian refugees from Burma and beyond has shocked the complacence built up by generations of security. At the same time lack of transport facilities and other circumstances have caused some hardship through local scarcity of necessary goods. Depression is apt to find an outlet in complaint, for which political rancour also has prepared the ground. But danger has done some good in bringing home the urgent need of preparation against attack, and has quickened the desire to assist in A.R.P. and Civil Defence; though there has been some dislocation of essential labour, this seems only temporary; and, where symptoms of defeatism have appeared, these are likely to be allayed when the Allies can check and hold the Japanese assault. Meanwhile some events of the greatest importance for India’s future have gone almost unnoticed; for instance the “repatriation” of about £150 millions, which with the previous figure of £100 millions has almost wiped out the sterling debt: and the association of the Indian representative with the representatives of 25 other nations in the declaration signed on January 2nd in Washington which pledges them to use all their resources against the Axis and to make no separate peace. Political .—In September 1940 the Congress defiantly rejected the offer made in the Viceroy’s announcement of August 8th and bound itself to follow Mr. Gandhi’s dictatorship in a campaign of civil disobedience. The Working Committee, meeting for the first time since that event, has now made a decision (since ratified by the All-India Congress Committee) which reaffirms the resolution of September 1940. The language used leaves no doubt of (1) the calculated hostility of the party towards the British Govern ment, which is described (for instance) as pursuing a policy of deliberate insult to Indian nationalism, perpetuation of unrestrained authoritarianism, and encouragement of disruptive and reactionary elements, and as arrogant Imperialism undistinguishable from Fascism; and (2) the party’s refusal to lend any assistance in the defence of the country unless the independence of India is immediately conceded. In some quarters there is a sedulous attempt to interpret the decision as in some way extending an offer of help in the war on certain terms; for this the only basis is a second resolution which relieves Mr. Gandhi of his command of the civil disobedience move ment, and by implication abandons the pacifist (whiokifc maintaining the political) ground for resistance to the war-effort. Mr. Gandhi will continue civil disobedience for free speech against all wars with selected Congress men and others; and the Working Committee has requested Congressmen to render him full assistance. It is difficult to find in these pronouncements an atmosphere in any way favourable to co-operation in the cause of the Allies. The Working Committee of the Muslim League has also met recently; it reaffirmed its approval of the Viceroy’s declaration of August 8th, 1940, and deplored the “growing tendency in a section of British Press and politicians” to depart from it in order to appease the Congress. As regards the War, the League professes to be still ready to shoulder the burden of the defence of the country, singly or in co-operation with other parties, on the terms already stated.2 Thus each party stands on conditions which it knows to be unacceptable to the other. The Hindu Mahasabha persisted, in the face of the Bihar Government’s prohibition, in an attempt to hold its annual Session at a place where communal disturbances have been frequent in recent years and at a time specially unsuitable on account of the Muslim festival of Bakr Id. It became necessary to arrest a number of leaders; these were released after a few days, and the incident is over, except for the unfortunate effects which such reckless disregard for public order and authority is bound to foster. The Frontier has remained tranquil. The unimpressive attempts of the Faqir of Ipi to raise the tribes against Government have been checked by heavy snowfall. The Afridis have been gratified by the reopening to them of enlistment in the Indian Army. The war with Japan has aroused little interest; the tribesmen regard the Japanese with detestation and contempt; and the Japanese successes, while causing some amusement at our expense, are not expected to endure.4 « pr ''' Honfidential 1 Gopy of the India No. 3 communication to of the Secretary appreciation of the political situation in of 1942 , vdiich has been prepared for the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments to the Governor General (Public). 1m ew Delhi. the SQ tk • 19 4S &lt; Major R.

India and the War .—The tide of alarm and defeatism in India has not yet ebbed. It has been kept at a high level by the influx of thousands of refugees from the Far East and by the failure of the Allies to check the advance of the Japanese. Its tangible effect on the war-effort is not great; but it is sapping confidence in the power of Government to keep the enemy at a distance from India and to maintain normal conditions of life and public order in the country. Among politicians the temptation to take advantage of these conditions has not always been resisted. In those circles, the stirring appeal for help in the war which Marshal Chiang Kai-Shek made at the end of his visit to India was less regarded than the hope he stated that Britain would as speedily as possible give “real political power” to the Indian people. The Viceroy has called on all men and women who live in this land to enrol themselves in the “National War Front', on which each one of them can be a soldier. “Stand steady; encourage the brave; strengthen the faint hearted; rebuke the babbler and root out the hidden traitor. Make good the defence of the country today; go forward to victory tomorrow; for without victory there is no hope for the survival of free institutions, culture, or kindness, in the world”. The turn taken by the war has made many fresh demands on Govern ments in India. These are being met in all possible ways; for instance, the vital task of improving communications by land between Burma and India is in hand, and the problems of easing the strain on rail transport in India and remedying local scarcity of wheat are being tackled. The third war budget of the Central Government was presented in the Legislative Assembly on February 28th. The revenue for 1942-43 is estimated at £114 million. This includes £9 million from new taxation, and nearly £15 million from railway revenues. Civil expenditure is estimated at £40 million and defence expenditure at £100 million. The gap of £26 million is to be covered by borrowing. A comparison of these figures with those of a vear ago (Appreciation No. 3 of 1941) shows a remarkable expansion. The sum of £100 million represents only a fraction of the total sum being spent in India on the war; the expenditure on defence services and supplies that the Government of India expect to recover from His Majesty's Government,2 under the operation of the financial settlement, will exceed £300 million in 1942-43. The new taxation proposals lower the minimum taxable income (though the arrangement, as regards the lower incomes, is such as to encourage saving rather than to produce revenue), increase the suichaige on Income-tax, impose an emergency surcharge upon customs duties, and increase petrol and kerosine duties, and postal and telegiaph rates. ic budget has evoked little adverse criticism. Political. —Delhi at the end of February was the scene of various party meetings, which passed wholly irreconcilable resolutions. But political comfcversy has for the moment been stilled by the announcement made y Mr Churchill on March 11th. In order to clothe with precision the policy announced in August 1940 and to convince all classes races and creeds m India of Britain’s sincere resolve, the War Cabinet have agreed united y upon conclusions for present and future action which, if accepted by India as a whole, would avoid the alternative dangers, either that the resistance of a powerful minority might impose an indefinite veto upon the wishes of majority or that a majority decision might be taken wh.ch would te rented to a point destructive of internal harmony and fatal to the setting } new Constitution. In order to ensure that the scheme will win a reasonable and practical measure of acceptance and thus promote thoughts and energies upon the defence of the country, Sn Stafford Uipps is being sent to India to satisfy himself by personal consultation that the inclusions will achieve their purpose. He will at the same time consult with the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief on the m.ilitar&gt; situat o .

India and the War .—The news of the war in the east grows worse. The Japanese made their first conquest of Indian territory on March 23rd when they occupied the Andaman Islands: on April 6th the ports of Vizagapatam and Cocanada were bombarded: the losses, grevious in themselves, inflicted on the Royal Navy and on merchant shipping near the coasts of India and Ceylon by very strong naval and air forces further imply a grave threat to India s communications as well as to her seaboard. The evacuation from Calcutta and Madras of many thousands of people whose presence there is not necessary is being encouraged and assisted by Government. The influx of great numbers of refugees from Burma, as well as from other parts of the Far East, has called for rapid improvisation in India of arrangements for transport, food, public health and accommodation, and official and non official agencies have successfully collaborated in these. The wheat harvest, which is a good one, should ease local hardships in north India; but the rice eating population will suffer from the loss of imports from Burma. A conference convened by the Government of India has recommended that programmes should be carried out under central control for the growing of more food crops and for their distribution. Political Anxiety about the war would have been greater but for the interest taken in the mission of Sir Stafford Cripps, the prelude to which was described in the last Appreciation. He arrived in New Delhi on March 23rd, and at once explained to political leaders the proposals of the War Cabinet. These were published on March 29th. The object of His Majesty’s Government was stated to be “the creation of a new Indian Union which shall constitute a Dominion associated with the United Kingdom and other Dominions by a common allegiance to the Crown but equal to them in every respect, in no way subordinate in any aspect of its domestic or external affairs”. For this purpose an elected body would be set up, immediately upon cessation of hostilities, to frame a con stitution, which His Majesty’s Government undertook to accept and imple ment forthwith, subject only to two provisions: first, any Province of British India that was not prepared to accept the new Constitution would have the light to retain its present position, or, if the non-acceding Provinces so desired, His Majesty’s Government would agree upon a new Constitution giving them the same full status as the Indian Union; second, a treaty would be negotiated between His Majesty’s Government and the Constitution- making body covering all matters _ arising out of the complete transfer of responsibility from British to Indian hands; this treaty would provide for the protection of minorities but would not impose any restriction on the power of the Indian Union to decide in future its relationship to other member-states of the British Commonwealth. The Constitution-making body would be composed (unless Indian leaders meanwhile agreed upon some other form) of about 160 persons elected by the Lower Houses of Provincial Legislatures and of a proportionate number of representatives of Indian States. (Whether or not a State elected to adhere to the new Constitution, it would be necessary to negotiate a revision of its treaty arrangements to meet the new situation.) In addition to this post-war programme, His Majesty’s Government, while necessarily retaining control and direction of the defence of India as part of their world war effort, invited “the immediate and effective participation of the leaders of the principal sections of the Indian people in the counsels of their country, of the Commonwealth and of the united nations”; and this would include the task of organising to the full the military, moral, and material resources of India. The Hindu Mahasabha at once rejected the scheme, on the grounds that the option given to Provinces to stay out of the Union would destroy the unity of the country and that (in the immediate arrangements) full powers2 over defence should be given to “Indian Ministers”. The Muslim League waited to see what the Congress would do: and the latter, represented mainly by the President (Maulana Azad) and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, sought to obtain from Sir Stafford a modification of the terms. It presently appeared that, though they disliked some features of the post-war arrangement, they would accept the scheme if a formula satisfactory to the Congress could be devised for the respective spheres in Defence of His Majesty’s Government represented by the Commander-in-Chief and of an Indian Defence Member in charge of the organisation of the military, moral and material resources of India. They invoked the aid of Colonel Louis Johnson, who had just arrived to supervise the American Technical Mission. But the negotiations, which had filled nearly three weeks, broke down when at the last moment the Congress leaders demanded a definite assurance that the new Government would function as a “Cabinet Government with full powers”. Sir Stafford in reply pointed out that this demand implied Constitutional changes of a most complicated character; and, if the system was to be introduced by convention, a Cabinet the members of which were to be nominated by the major political organisations would be responsible to no one but itself, could not be removed, and would in fact constitute an absolute dictatorship of the majority. “In a country such as India, where communal divisions are still so deep, an irresponsible majority Government of this kind is not possible”. As soon as it was known that the Congress would not accept the scheme, Mr. Jinnah published the views of the Muslim League Working Committee. They too rejected the scheme, mainly on the ground that the post-war provi sions permitting the partition of India were so framed as not to give real protection to Muslims; they did not discuss the interim arrangements. The effect of these pronouncements is that the major political parties have again, as in 1940, refused to assume in concert the duty of prosecuting India’s war. The responsibilty for this outcome must rest in the main on Congress. As Sir Stafford has said—“The Congress wanted all or nothing. They could not have all, so they got nothing”. But the Congress leaders, at any rate an influential section of them, have been drawn much nearer than ever before to co-operation in the war effort. Mr. Gandhi in his latest reflections on the war divides all Indians (so far as they are not his followers in “non-violent resistance”) into two sections—those who would welcome the Japanese yoke in exchange for the British, and those who are neutral and win help neither the British nor the Japanese. The falsity of this analysis is clear; even Congress leaders have earnestly avowed their desire that Japanese aggression should be repelled by force of arms. Whatever the motives that have deterred the parties from joining in the fulfilment of that task, it is generally agreed that Sir Stafford’s mission has improved relations between India and Britain. The Frontier .—While the Frontier has generally been quiet and there has even been some debate whether religious duty does not call for a cessation of hostilities against the British now that the more idolatrous Japanese are on the horizon, in Waziristan hostile leaders have persisted in their attempt to overawe friendly tribesmen and to induce them to cease co-operation with Government. In north Waziristan one such attempt was severely punished by air attack on the leader’s village, and this in addition to the losses incurred in recent actions with Government forces has had a chastening effect.si'*' ti-M% fit S. f V qP C onfidential . ^ 0 L( 1 Copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No* 5 of 1942 , which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the G-overnor-G-eneral (Public).

India and the War .—The news in the east in the past month has been both good and bad. The bombing of Tokyo, the occupation of Diego Suarez by British forces, and the heavy Josses indicted on the Japanese m the Coral Sea have been welcomed. But, nearer home, the Japanese are over running Burma, from which the Governor and Ministers have taken refuge in India; and, after more than a month's respite, India has again been attacked from the air—Chittagong on May 8th and 9th and a town in Assam on the 10th. Both the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief have spoken to the people on All-India Radio. On April 21st the Commander-in-Chief gave grounds for regarding the future with confidence; in particular the danger from the air must not be exaggerated; our defence against it and against invasion would be strong; “nothing can stop us winning the war—but defeatism or unreasoning panic may hinder and delay victory”. The Viceroy’s appeal was made in furtherance of the National War Eront (for which see the March Appreciation). He described the people as the un armed forces of the country, and called on them to show the will to unite and the will to act. He explained the creed of the “Front”, and the ways in which every man and woman could serve it: in everything they should show a spirit of attack. The problem of assisting refugees from Burma, mentioned in the last Appreciation, has been the subject of much ill-informed, and some malicious, criticism. The Member of the Government of India concerned with it has given the number of refugees who have arrived from Burma as a quarter of a million, including 50,000 brought by sea from Rangoon at a time when shipping was short and conditions of embarkation particularly difficult; some indication of the measure of assistance given to the refugees appears from the fact that at one station alone free railway tickets to the value of £65,000 have been issued. The American Technical Mission is hard at work in India, devising means, to assist in providing the equipment essential for the expansion of Indian war industries. Political .—The aims, and failure, of Sir Stafford Cripps’ mission were described in the last Appreciation. The subject was debated in the House of Commons on April 28th; and Sir Stafford included among the items which could be placed on the credit side the determination which had been shown by the Indian peoples to defend their country. He mentioned Congressmen as among the leaders who had given evidence of that; but the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee, held at Allahabad just after the Commons debate, has made it clear that the Congress will take no part in the effective defence of India. The very leaders, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in particular, who in negotiation with Sir Stafford a few weeks before were pressing for responsibility for defence, sponsored, and carried, at Allahabad a resolution which prescribed “non-violent non-co-operation” as the only possible manner of resistance to invasion, and demanded the abandonment of British authority in India. “If India were free she would have determined her own policy and might have kept out of the War.” In other resolutions the defence measures taken by the Government, and the behaviour of soldiers in India, were described in terms intended, and likely, to bring the Government, and the troops, into hatred and contempt. (The behaviour of troops has in fact been generally good, but a few exceptions have been made the basis for gross exaggerations and inventions, to which Mr. Gandhi has given currency.) The Government therefore issued orders ^vhich prevented the publication of one resolution and of part of another. Even this profession of “non-violence” does not satisfy Mr. Gandhi, whopreaches the doctrine that all British and American forces should at once withdraw from India, in the hope that the Japanese would then refrain from invasion. In the last Appreciation it was stated that Sir Stah’ord s mission has improved relations between India and Britain. One of the Congress resolu tions, on the other hand, claims that it has led to greater bitterness and distrust of the British Government. This seems to be true as regards the attitude of Congressmen themselves (especially of a section which shows an increasing desire not to offend the Japanese); but it is not true as regaids wider circles. Even among Congressmen defeatism does not pass unchallenged; Mr. Rajagopalachari, certainly the ablest administrator that the Congress has produced, has resigned from the Working Committee in order to press his movement for a rapprochement with the Muslim League as a step towards the setting up of a National Government to organise the armed defence of India as effectively as possible. The All-India Congress Committee at Allahabad, by rejecting this policy, showed itself as intransigent towards minorities as towards the Government, and indifferent to the realities of India's peril. The Frontier .—The tranquillity of the Frontier has been broken only in North Waziristan whither the Faqir of Ipi, strengthened by financial subventions from Axis sources in Kabul, has despatched large gangs. It is however satisfactory that the local tribes, if they have not resisted these gangs, have at least given them no aid or encouragement. The sudden flaring up of an old boundary dispute brought Mahsuds apd Wazirs to the brink of hostilities. But at the last moment Government’s orders were deferred to, and although neither party is satisfied, the peace has for the time being been preserved.HP ** 1 Copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. 8 of 1942 , which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Grovernor-Greneral (Public) * #*-&gt; • New Delhi, thel9^' August 1942 » Major R.G-.E.W.Alban, Political Agen 'Bahrain.

India and the War .—The Caucasian gate to the East is in danger of being forced, and it is not yet clear whether the enemy’s drive against the Egyptian gate is held or merely stayed; but Japan’s inaction towards India continues, and the country continues to be less concerned with the dangers of the war than with internal affairs. The dislocation of normal economic life is becoming rapidly more apparent. An increasing number of articles is being subjected to price control, but there are great difficulties in the way of organising the regulation of prices in a country so vast as India, with transport inadequate to the claims made upon it, scarcity of some goods, and much hoarding and profiteering. These conditions hit consumers in the towns much harder than the villagers; and agriculturists have reason to be satisfied with a monsoon which has hitherto been favourable in most parts of the country. The grant of larger “dearness allowances’’ to urban workers should help to alleviate the situation. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India has recently described the banking system of the country as sustaining the impact of war conditions with remarkable resilience; ‘nn spite of panicky withdrawals from a few banks in December last, the deposits showed a large increase over the year”. Political .—During the course of the war it has become more and more apparent that the Congress, under the leadership of Mr. Gandhi and the Working Committee, would go to almost any lengths in exploiting Britain’s difficulties with the object of wresting power for itself. For months Mr. Gandhi has been working up an agitation the real purpose of which (to enforce the withdrawal from India of British power and of British and American armed forces, in order to obtain both the independence of India and peace with Japan) has latterly been disguised in the hope of allaying the strong disapproval which the theme aroused everywhere except in the Axis countries. The resolutions drafted by the Working Committee in the middle of July were described in the last Appreciation; early in August the Working Committee, meeting in Bombay, made a further attempt to dress up its purpose; but the main feature—a demand for the immediate ending of British rule backed by the threat of mass civil disobedience— was reaffirmed. The pretence now adopted, that independence was desired in order to enable effective resistance to Japan tP be organised, should not2 in any ease have deceived anyone familiar with the record of the Congress; but its hollowness was betrayed by certain documents which were published by the Government at this juncture. These included the text of a resolution drafted by Mr. Gandhi, which was approved by the Working Committee at the end of April. At the last moment a milder version was substituted, and this (see the Appreciation of last May) was adopted by the A.-I.C.C. at that time. Mr. Gandhi’s draft left no doubt of his defeatist intentions; and the revelation of these powerfully influenced opinion outside Congress circles on the eve of the last meeting of the A.-I.C.C. - which assembled at Bombay on August 7th. That body however is a mere echo of the High Command and tiie resolutions placed before it were accepted on August 8tn. The challenge so offered was one which the Government had to accept at •once. Mr. Gandhi hoped to play for time in working up his ‘‘open rebellion” by corresponding with the Viceroy, while the Congress President was to address appeals to President Roosevelt, Marshal Chiang Kai-shek, and Mr. Maisky. In the early morning of August 9th Mr. Gandhi and the Members of the Working Committee were arrested; and before long all leaders of Congress capable of organising local trouble were similarly taken into custody throughout the country; and Congress committees of various grades have been declared to be unlawful associations. The Government had information of the intended programme of civil' disobedience; this included some forms of sabotage (such as stopping trains and cutting telegraph and telephone wires) which even in peace time would be incompatible with non-violence; and it is significant that these have been a feature of the rioting which has broken out in various parts of the country. There was much disorder, seme looting, and some destruction of Govern- .ment property in Bombay, Delhi, Patna, Nagpur and elsewhere; in many places the police and troops have had to fire on riotous mobs. Mr. Gandhi’s experiments in civil disobedience have usually been accompanied by violence in the past; he and other Congress leaders have of late propagated bittef feeling against the Government; and there was no reason to suppose that such regrettable scenes would be avoided on this occasion. The latest accounts show that serious disorder continues in some areas where Congress .influence is specially strong. Railway communications have in one such area been persistently interrupted; murderous outrages have occurred here and there; for ■ instance at on^fe place a senior Magistrate and Police officers, who refused an offer of their lives if they joined the Congress and resigned Government ;service were brutally done to death. But several Provinces have been practically free from trouble; in most cities and towns where the early disturbances occurred order has been restored; and the Government have no doubt of their ability to restore it everywhere. That His Majesty’s Government would not flinch from their duty to take every possible step to meet the Congress' challenge was made clear at the end of July by twospokesmen—Sir Stafford Cripps in a broadcast to America and Mr. Amery in the House of Commons. At the same time both pronouncements made it clear also that Britain stands by the broad intentions of the “Cripps offer”. A step taken by the Government of India towards the end of July is worth mention—the removal of the ban on the Communist Party of India, imposed eight years ago. For some time past, leaders of the Party had professed a desire to support a pro-war policy, and individual communists who seemed to show a genuine change of heart had been released from custody. But communism in India has often been merely a label for plans of revolutionary violence; and it is too early to form an opinion whether the communists' will make any useful contribution to the war-effort. The 'North-West Frontier .—In North Waziristan the continued isola tion of the most westerly post in the Tochi Valley necessitated the despatch of a relief column supported by aircraft. Surprised at the strength of the Government forces the hostiles dispersed and the column aided by local tribesmen reached its objective with negligible opposition. Advantage is being taken of the presence of troops in the Tochi Valley to assist friendly tribal leaders to reassert their authority and to obtain a satisfactory settle ment with those tribes some of whose members have assisted the hostiles. Tribal reactions to efforts to enlist their support for the civil disobedience campaign have been altogether satisfactory.C on fi dential . 1 Copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. 9 of 1942 , Yirhich has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the G-ovemor-Greneral (Public).

India and the War .—India continues to be less interested in the war than m internal affairs. r J he third anniversary of the declaration of war was the occasion for a broadcast by General Wavell who had lately participated in momentous conferences in Cairo and -Moscow. His estimate is that we begin the fourth year of this war with much better prospects than we did the fourth year of the last war. The danger to India, he said, is closer than it has been for more than 150 years : but her armed forces are stronger and better equipped than ever before, her industrial progress in the making of munitions has been astonishing, and the military renown of her soldiers never stood higher. It is the disciplined might of her fighting men that is saving and will save India. “ They must be helped and not betrayed. Lift up your hearts then, and trust in your fighting men. ” The progress in the industrial effort is shown by the rise in the value of war orders ; those executed in the first two years of the war amounted to £123 million, while the figure for the third year alone is £150 million. High explosives such as TNT are being manufactured for the first time in India, and the making of alloy steels has also been undertaken. The production of medical instruments has so increased as to enable India not only to meet the expanding demands of her own Defence Services but to send substantial supplies to Russia. The output of army clothing now exceeds 10 million garments a month. Two years ago, as a measure of internal defence, a voluntary force known as the “ Civic Guards ” w r as constituted. They are auxiliary to the regular police force, and are drawn from all classes of people; they w r ear uniform and receive allowances while actually on duty or under training; they are mostly unarmed ; their work includes traffic control, night patrols, combating rumours, and assisting in the maintenance of order at times of communal tension. Out of a total proposed cadre of 90,000 nearly 70,000 have been recruited. The sixth session of the National Defence Council was held in New Delhi from September 7th to 9th. Included in the agenda w r ere a review of the war situation by the Commander-in-Chief, a discussion of price control (about which an important conference was proceeding at the same time), and a detailed review of the civil disobedience movement. Political .—The last Appreciation described the first phases of Mr. Gandhi’s “ open rebellion ”. A special session of the Central Legislative Assembly has Leen summoned, to provide an opportunity for discussion of it, and the debate2 is proceeding. Some figures have been given of the casualties caused and suffered by the forces of Government: according to the most recent reports, which are not yet complete, 340 persons were killed by firing on the part of the police and 318 on the part of the troops. Of the police 31 were killed and a large number injured: of the troops, 11 killed and 7 wounded; of civil officials, excluding those of the posts and telegraphs and railways, 7 killed and 16 injured. Troops were called out in 60 places. Other details given are of over 3,500 cases of wire-cutting: 24 derailments on railways and 250 stations damaged : 53 post offices gutted and 200 seriously damaged: about 45 police stations destroyed, and a number of other buildings including courts and treasuries. The total damage to Government property will be in the neighbourhood of a million pounds. “Today”, the Borne Member said, “ although many terrible things have happened, control has been established almost everywhere, and the country as a whole is quiet; and although this suicidal movement is not yet finally quelled, we can feel some justifiable confidence in our power to deal with any situation that may yet arise ”. Already attempts are being made to exonerate the Congress from responsibility for these events; the Home Member claims that this is impossible in face of the terms of the resolutions passed by the All-India Congress Committee early in August; moreover the utterances of Congress leaders themselves cannot be interpreted except on the assumption that they knew and approved of what was likely to come; the forms of sabotage that have occurred had been enjoined on Congress bodies, and show clear evidence of previous organisation; and in very many instances local Congress leaders led and incited mobs to violence. The Muslim community and Scheduled Castes as a whole stood aloof from the disturbances. The Home Member paid a tribute to the manner in which not only the police, on whom the deadliest attacks usually fell, but all ranks of Government servants had stood firm and done their duty in face of all attempts to subvert or terrorise them. Labour also, where it was left alone, generally showed no disposition to give trouble; the strikes that did occur were the direct result of political influence backed by ample funds. The Member for War Transport has spoken with warm appreciation of the conduct of the railway staff during the disturbances. The recent debate in the House of Commons has been followed in India with close interest; comment has hitherto been mostly directed to the Prime Minister’s blunt condemnation of the Congress Party, and his suggestion that their activities have been aided by Japanese fifth-column work. The speech has shocked and angered Hindu political opinion, so long accustomed to the Congress being treated at its own valuation. While the Congress is out of the way, the Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha have been vocal. The Working Committee of the League in a resolution passed at Bombay on August 20th condemned the civil disobediencemovement as an instrument for forcing the British. Government and Muslims to surrender to Congress dictation, and directed Muslims to refrain from participating in it; at the same time it demanded from the British Government an immediate declaration guaranteeing to the Muslims the right of self- determination and a pledge “ that they will abide by the verdict of a plebiscite of Mussalmans and give effect to the Pakistan scheme”. The Working Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha met at the end of August and formulated demands which do not differ markedly from those of the Congress except that they are more militaristic and more openly antagonistic to the Muslim League; but they also set up a committee headed by Dr. Mookerjee, the Finance Minister in Bengal and working President of the Mahasabha, “ to make a final effort for an Indo-British settlement on honourable terms ”. Clearly the first requirement for such a settlement is some arrangement of Indian differences ; and no results in that direction are yet apparent. General .—■Ministerial administration was restored in Assam at the end of August after being in abeyance for eight months. Sir Muhammad Saadulla, the former and present Premier, now expects a greater measure of stability than previous Ministries have enjoyed. It is worthy of note that the near threat of the Japanese has not deterred a Ministry pledged to support the war effort from assuming office. There have been serious disorders in jails in Dacca (Bengal) and Bhagalpur (Bihar). These were caused by ordinary criminals, who however may have been hoping to profit by the general unrest resulting from the Congress revolt. The North-West Frontier .—The column despatched to Tochi Yalley withdrew without opposition, and North Waziristan has since enjoyed a period of repose. The Faqir of Iqi has turned his attention to South Waziristan where a long-standing boundary dispute presents him with the opportunity to make trouble; his efforts have so far met with little success. Congress envoys to the tribes have had a thoroughly discouraging reception.CONFIDEFTIAL.

Poll tic al Agent, Banram.[Confidential, j APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. ♦ No. 4 of the 1943 Series, Aprit 16th, 1943. . India and the War .—The most encouraging war news lias been Jrom the Tunisian front, in which the exploits of the 4th Indian Division ave been specially mentioned. The news nearer home is less pleasing. Japanese air-raids have been frequent in south-east Bengal, though trie damage caused has not been great; and the course of the Arakan campaign has been disappointing. The Indian Air Force celebrated its tenth birthday on April 1st. The completion of the 10-squadron plan announced November 1941 is now m sight; the limiting-factor is not the lack of modern types of aircraft but an insufficiency of trained Indian technicians for* ground duties. The problem of food prices and supplies continues to worry the ordinary consumer and to receive the close attention of the Government. ^ 01 u a e there was a critical shortage of rice in Bengal. On the whole, however., the improved war situation, the arrival of shipments of Australian wheat, and good harvest prospects have caused some improvement m public confidence. The Central Government have framed a 12-months plan to guide and co-ordinate the food policies of all Provincial and State Govern ments. They‘have also announced that, though they do not expect a ny serious fall in prices to result from the increasing output of foodgrams wh ich the “Grow More Food” campaign aims at achieving, they will be prepared to intervene, if during the war and one year thereafter prices of foodgrams tend to fall below a level which would give a reasonable return to the cultivator, and will buy at fair prices all foodgrains offered to them m the open market. Since the outbreak of war, under the stimulus.of the vast demands to meet Defence requirements and of the difficulties in importing from overseas, ‘•'Indian industry has shown remarkable development. A hen these demands disappear and overseas trade becomes normal, these new and expanded industries will experience a variety of difficulties, and it is most important that all possible guidance should be given so that the momentum that has now been received may not be lost, and that industrial development may continue over an ever-widening field. It has therefore been decided to create a new Department of Industries and Civil Supplies to deal with present and post-war problems.2 Political .—The need to extend once again the Proclamations imposing Governor’s rule in the six Provinces where the Congress have since 1939 made Ministerial administration impossible has been the occasion of debates on India in both Houses of Parliament. These showed an increasing comprehension of the totalitarian aims and dangerous activities of the Congress Party; and also growing doubts as to the suitability for India oW Parliamentary democracy of the British type. ® In the last Appreciation, the intention of certain prominent persons to ask the Viceroy for permission to interview Mr. Gandhi was mentioned. On April 1st five Hindu gentlemen including Mr. Rajagopalachari submitted to the Viceroy a memorandum in which this request was made; the ground given was that they had no doubt that Mr. Gandhi would cast his intiuence on the side of internal harmony and conciliation. The Viceroy’s reply pointed out that nothing whatever positive had emerged as a result of the contacts between Mr. Gandhi and his friends during his recent fast, and that there is no reason to believe that Mr, Gandhi is any more ready now than he was at an earlier stage to repudiate the policy as the result of which the Congress leaders are under detention; while these conditions remain, special facilities for contact with Mr. Gandhi and the Congress leaders could not be given. The Viceroy added a comment on the suggestion that only if these gentlemen were permitted to consult Mr. Gandhi could a genuine National Government be formed; this, he said, showed a complete misapprehension of the true character of a National Government: the essential preliminary to such a Government is that agreement between parties, communities and interests which he has been so anxious to foster, but to which the excessive claims and the totalitarian ambitions of the Congress and its leaders have been so consistent an obstacle. The Viceroy’s decision caused little surprise, and was approved by political parties and groups opposed to the Congress; the journal of the Muslim League, indeed, has expressed the hope that “the purposeless interference of political busybodies' will now cease. The Coalition Ministry in Bengal formed by Mr. Fazlul Huq in .December 1941 has fallen. During the budget session the strength of the opposition increased, and though the Ministry were never actually defeated, Mr. Huq found his position untenable. On March 28th he resigned; and, as there was no time before the close of the financial year to form a new Ministry, the Governor with reluctance temporarily assumed charge of the administration to ensure a legal grant of supply. He has since asked Sir Nazimuddin, the Muslim League leader of the opposition, to form a Ministry..Mr. Huq had been Premier of Bengal since Provincial Autonomy was established in 1937; in recent years his main interest has appeard to be his own continuance in office; but in spite of his opportunist agility his follow ing dwindled, especially among Muslims, and his profession of a desire that 1 a truly National Government should be formed in the Province won little credence. General .—Public order now suffers from Congress activity only in parts of two Provinces. In Sind, where martial law was imposed in June 1942 in order to suppress the fanatical outrages of the “Hurs”, their leader, the Pir Pagaro, has lately been executed, after conviction on charges of waging war against the King-Emperor. Disorder is practically at an end, and it is hoped that the withdrawal of martial law from the area will be possible before long. The proposal of the South African Government to extend anti-Indian legislation in the Transvaal and impose it in Natal has aroused public opinion in India. The Government of India have addressed a protest to fhe South African Government. The North-West Frontier has been quiet except for occasional small raids in the settled districts by gangs of bad characters. The Viceroy during a tour of the Frontier has visited the headquarters of North Waziristan. He was presented by tribal leaders with a purse of money for the wounded and prisoners -of war, and was assured that in spite of recent lapses the tribes were at heart friends of Government.SSec**' cmvimmkL. ue 'TV 1 cody 'of the appreciation of the political situation in India Ho.5 of 1^3 series, 1 which has been prepared for comunication to the Dominions, forwarded with the ccanplimanta o± the secretary t the Governor-General (Public)• New Delhi, the 3'^ To Political Agent, BV [Confidential.] APPRECIATION EOR THE DOMINIONS. Ho. 5 of the 1943 Series, Ma/y 16th, 1943. India and the H a/-.—The suddenness and completeness of the victory in Tunisia have made a deep impression on India; and the ti ibutes pait to the Indian troops who crowned their achievements over several years ot fighting in Africa by receiving the surrender of General von Arnim are a source of natural pride. The Viceroy when broadcasting the announcement that May 21st would be kept as a public holiday to celebrate the victory said, The most direct and immediate benefit to India is the removal of a deadl) threat to her own western approaches.’ Having just returned from visiting the troops on the eastern frontier, he went on to warn his listeners against a spurious confidence that the war is won, and to remind them that a war in which the Japanese are not defeated as utterly as the Germans will have been fought in vain. Further withdrawals of our troops in Arakan in fact discouiage any tendency in India to underestimate the strength of Japan; and anotnei counterpoise to good news lies in the economic difficulties that s i &gt;ese country. Bengal is again suffering from a severe shortage of rice, am ie Central Government have decided to introduce free trade m North-Dast India, in the hope of lowering prices, bringing out hidden stocks and restor ing confidence. The wheat situation is rather more satisfactory; a record yield is expected from the crop now being harvested, though the price remains unusually high. High prices of foodgrains are of comse o advantage to the growers—even when middlemen get a large share ot tne profit; therefore against the discontent of the towns, which is loud and assured of good publicity, must be set the increased prosperity (not advertised but unmistakable) of a great part of the countryside. But the lack of cloth at reasonable prices hits everybody, and recently the demand for the expedi tion of the Government scheme for the production and distribution of cheap standard cloth has been intensified. Political. —The vacancies in the Viceroy’s Executive Council, caused by the resignations of three Members during Mr. Gandhi s fast in February, have now been filled. The new Members are Sir Azizul Hucpie, till lately High Commissioner for India in the United Kingdom; Dr. N. B. Khare, who was the first Congress Premier of the Central Provinces but who was expelled from the post and the party in 1938 for questioning the dictates of the “High Command ”; and Sir Asoka Roy, the Advocate-General of Bengal, who has joined as Law Member. The annual session of the Muslim League was held in Delhi at the end of April. The main resolution regretted the Government’s failure to guarantee Muslim self-determination, warned the Government that the imposition of any kind of federal constitution would be forcibly resisted, and exhorted Muslims to face the effort and sacrifice required to reach the cherished goal of Pakistan. The session was dominated by Mr. Jinnah, who was elected President for the eighth time; and gave proof of the present strength of the League. The President’s speech and those made on the main resolution have been much discussed in political circles, but without the ».-w * 2 • * discovery of anything really new. Mr. Jinnah announced that he would welcome a settlement between Mr. Gandhi and the League, and invited Mr. Gandhi to make a direct approach to himself; but showed no genuine willingness to move towards a communal settlement: even the meaning of the Pakistan claim is still not authoritatively defined. Though the League repeats its profession of readiness (on its own terms) to share the Central Government’s burden of administration, more serious attention is paid in political circles to the strengthening of its hold on the Provinces where Muslims are in a majority, and to the evidence that it is following the tactics of Congress in 1937—39 in asserting control over the Ministries. In the course of his Presidential address Mr. Jinnah said: “So long as these Ministries remain within the orbit of the fundamental principles and policy of the League, they will certainly have our support, but I want to make it once more clear that the time has now come when we will not hesitate to* withdraw our support from any Ministry.'' As was foreshadowed in the last Appreciation, Sir Nazimuddin, the leader of the Muslim League in Bengal, has succeeded in forming a Ministry. Though it is a coalition, its following among caste Hindus (as distinct from “scheduled castes-’ or depressed classes) appears to be weak. Developments in Bengal, and the success of the Delhi session, have been followed up by a strengthening of League influence in the North-West Frontier Province, where the Governor has recently asked the leader of the League party in the Assembly if he is in a position to form a Ministry. In 1939 the Congress resigned in eight out of the eleven Provinces; first in Assam, and much later in Orissa, it was found possible to establish non-Congress Ministries; if the League’s efforts in the Frontier Province succeed, both the Muslim majority Provinces which fell under the control of the Congress (Assam and the Frontier) will have thrown over that unnatural connection; and for the first time since the Congress resignations the greater number of Provinces (six out of eleven) will be under Ministerial administration. General .—A recent judgment of the Federal Court held that the Defence of India rule under which some thousands of persons (includ ing Mr. Gandhi and the members of the Congress Working Committee) are held under detention is invalid as going beyond the rule-making provisions of the Defence of India Act. This decision excited a demand from the nationalist press that all detenus.should be released forthwith. The defect in the Act was rectified at once with retrospective effect by an Ordinance of the Governor-General. The anti-Indian legislation in South Africa, mentioned in the last Appreciation, has provoked a good deal of bitter feeling. When the Bill passed the Dominion’s Parliament, the Government of India announced that they were in full accord with the public opinion in the country which had unanimously protested that the legislation was repugnant, unnecessary and inopportune. Mr. Allah Bakhsh, a'former Premier of Sind, and one of the -few prominent Muslim politicians outside the League, has been murdered; so far as is at present known, the crime has no political or communal significance. In Waziristan and in the adjoining districts of the North-West Frontier Province a revival of hostile activities has been prompted, so the Frontier tribes widely believe, by the recent receipt of Axis money by the Fakir of I pi. These outrages have been the work of professional cut-throats and have had no wide tribal support. * , ■; . j' C a • d ■ *- ■ ■ ■ &gt; ■ &gt; • ; 4X ^ \ \ CONFIDENTIAL.

It rests with Mr. Gandhi to satisfy the Government of India that he can safely be allowed once more to participate in public affairs of the country, and until he does so the disabilities from which he suffers are of his own choice”. The Hindu nationalist press immediately denounced this decision as a clear proof of the insincerity of British pronouncements about constitutional progress. At first some Muslim papers also were critical, but they rallied to Mr. Jinnah who came out with a statement f describing the letter as £C a move to embroil the Muslim League in a clash *with the British Government solely to secure his release so that he would be free to do what he pleases thereafter”. His own suggestion that Mr. Gandhi should communicate with him had been made in response to pressure by certain Hindu leaders who maintained that “Mr. Gandhi had realised he had made a mistake, that he would be prepared to reconsider and retrace his steps.” Mr. Gandhi, however, had given no indication of any change of the Congress policy or any desire to settle with the League on the basis of Pakistan. The Hindu nationalist press at once diverted their fire from the Government to Mr. Jinnah, and the incident has had little effect beyond perhaps a slight further deterioration in Hindu-Muslim relations. 5. A Ministry has been formed in the Frontier Province, as was fore shadowed in the last Appreciation. The Premier and three of his colleagues are Muslims, and the fifth member of the Ministry is a Sikh. This restora tion of normal administration in one more Province has led to negotiations among the non-Congress elements in the Legislatures of other Provinces at present under emergency administration; but it is too early yet to say whether any stable coalitions are likely to be formed. 6. The Communist party held its first “congress” in Bombay during the last week of May. Since its legitimization in July 1942, the party has attempted to combine a pro-war and an anti-government policy. The mam planks of the party’s platform are the release of the Congress leaders, a settlement between the Congress and the Muslim League on the basis of Muslim self-determination, the establishment of a “national government for national defence”, the combating of sabotage, and propaganda against food hoarding. The dissolution of the Comintern has been welcomed by \ the partv, but is unlikely to make much practical difference to its activities. 7 General .—Martial Law was withdrawn in the Hur area of Sind on June 1st (see Appreciation for April). A Special Commissioner has been appointed to co-ordinate the restoration of normal civil administration. 8. The Federal Court has held certain provisions of the Special Criminal Courts Ordinance to be invalid. This Ordinance permitted expeditious procedure for trying certain offences and was used during the Congiess rebellion. It has now been repealed, and a fresh Ordinance issued validat ing sentences passed but restoring normal appellate rights to the convicted persons.[Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 6 of the 1943 Series, June 15th, 1943. India and the TEar.—During the past month, the Allied forces heave been engaged mainly in preparations for further offensives. The destruction of the Ruhr dams and the surrender of Pantellaria have attracted SOI ^ e public attention: but India is more interested in the eastern end of the Axis; and Mr. Churchill’s assurance to the United States Congress that Britain would wage “unceasing and relentless” war against Japan whicbA would proceed concurrently with action against Germany, has ^ therefore been welcomed. Reports of the celebrations of Tunisia Day on Mjny 21st from most parts of the country have revealed an unexpectedly wide spread and genuine appreciation of the Allied victory. 2. The main difficulties confronting the Government of India continue to be economic rather than political: the checking of inflation, and the procurement and equitable distribution of food and cloth are the most important current administrative problems. An Ordinance has been passed the main purpose Qf which is to draw into the Government Exchequei ail but 6| per cent, of Excess Profits. Provision has been made for summary assessments of income-tax with a view to earlier recovery and tne Govern ment has also taken power to prevent the flotation of economically unsound financial concerns. The introduction of free trade in foodgrains m the eastern region, mentioned in the last Appreciation, has not yet restored the critical situation in Bengal, and there have been complaints that distuct officers in this region outside Bengal have requisitioned stocks in order to, secure local self-sufficiency. 3. The Government have recently adopted a series of measures to restrain speculation and stabilise the prices of cotton. They have also taken the important decision to establish control over the cotton textiles industry, with the object of increasing production and reducing the puces of cloth and yarn. Prices have already shown a downward tendency, which should be accelerated as soon as the industry has delivered the bulk of the 1,000 million yard.s of cheap standard cloth which it has promised to make available by the end of the year. 4. Political. —Half-a-dozen Hindu Moderates, led by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Dr. Jayakar, issued a statement on May 22nd urging the appointment of an impartial tribunal to investigate the charges against Mr. Gandhi and the other detained Congress leaders. Jhe Secretary of State’s brief answer in the House of Commons on May 27th that the Govern ment had no intention of staging such a trial caused no surprise. More • interest in political circles was aroused by the announcement that the Government of India had received a request from Mr. Gandhi to foiwaid a short letter from himself to Mr. Jinnah expressing a wish to meet him; and that they had refused to forward the letter. “They are not prepared , the announcement ran, “to give facilities for political correspondence orOne copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. } of 1943, series, which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Governor-General (Public). • New Delhi, the. .' • fi . V rrasiM''^r &amp; ^zy [Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 7 of the 1943 Semes, July 16th, 1943. India and the IPnr.—After the Tunisian victory Indian interest in the war died away until the exciting news came of the invasion of Sicily by British and American forces. Even this great enterprise has lifted attention only for a moment from the domestic worries of high prices and short supplies of essential goods. The announcement, made by the Axis radio on June 19th, of Subhas Bose’s transfer from Berlin to Tokyo, and those of his move to Singapore and of his plans for the salvation of India from British rule, have fallen flat. The steps taken to supply areas deficient in wheat, rice and millets had not succeeded, and prices remained unnaturally high. ^ An important conference on Food, attended by representatives of all Provinces and States was opened by the Viceroy in Delhi on July 5th. The main conclusions of the conference, which have been accepted by the Central Government, are to reject the establishment of free trade except as a long-range objective for the return of normal conditions, to confirm existing plans for the adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies, to introduce rationing in towns as soon as possible, to leave price control to administrative measures without statutory fixation’of maxima, to promote anti-hoarding measures, to improve food transport facilities, and to combat the shortage of consumers’ goods. (As regards the last conclusion, the Cloth Control Order, mentioned in the last Appreciation, has brought down the price of cloth substantially.) The appointment of Field-Marshal Lord Waved to succeed Lord Linlithgow as Viceroy at first confounded the prophets but has_ had an fexcellent reception. It has naturally been remarked that the appointment of a soldier to the post is without precedent; and in some political circles omens were drawn from the fact that the Viceroy-designate has been a member of the Government which put down the Congress rebellion. Lord Wayell m addressing a conference of journalists m London has claimed to be a smceie friend of India and wholeheartedly in sympathy with her aspirations to political development; “there is certainly no intention to set up anything m2 the shape of military rule or to withdraw or weaken in any way the pledges • and offers already made to India by His Majesty’s Goyernment”. The reappointment of General Auchinleck as Commander-in-Chief has been warmly welcomed in all quarters. Political .—The fall of Mr. Fazlul Huq’s Ministry in Bengal was mentioned in the April Appreciation. In the Legislative Assembly he has taken the first opportunity to state his case and in doing so has made an unbridled attack on.the Governor. The new Ministry has been thwarted in its attempt to pass the Budget for 1943-44 by a ruling of the Speaker who on technical grounds has refused to permit the procedure adopted^ In the Sind Assembly, the Ministry has been defeated on proposals for raising the rates of land revenue over most of the Province; but it does not appear that the Ministry’s stability is thereby threatened. In the Frontier Province, where a Muslim League Ministry was recently formed, a number of bye- elections to the Assembly will shortly be held; and, as the Congress party is fighting them, the results will be of more than local interest. In some of the five Provinces where there are now no Ministries there is from time to time talk among the non-Congress parties of forming coali tions which would enable Ministerial government to be resumed; but in none of them is this likely to be achieved at present. General .—An increase in crimes against property has been reported from several Provinces as a result of the difficult economic situation. This, combined with the decision of the Federal Court mentioned in the last Appreciation, is placing an unusual strain on the working of the criminal courts. In Waziristan the Faqir of Ipi has taken up residence on the Afgha. border and has backed his call for recruits by announcing that he_ is prepared to pay them. Notices dropped from the air on the contiguous tribes warning them that Government would take action against them if they send contingents to join him have had a restraining effect.[Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. Ao. 8 of the 1943 Series, August 16th, 1943. I India and the War .—The conquest of almost the whole of Sicily, the sudden fall of Mussolini, the advance of the Russian armies, and the renewal of discussions between Mr. Churchill and President Roosevelt, have^ all encouraged hopes, perhaps too confident, of an early end to the war m Europe—the main importance of which, in the eyes of India, lies m the nearer prospect of defeating Japan. The food situation continues to cause much anxiety. The monsoon is on the whole favourable, but the immediate effect of the rains is to reduce the flow of foodgrains to the markets. Distress is increasingly acute m most of Bengal and severe in some other parts of the country. Floods m west Bengal have accentuated the difficulty of transporting food to that region. The Viceroy gave a farewell address to a joint session of the Central Legislature on August 2nd. He gave a comprehensive review of the achieve ments of India in nearly four years of war: her armed forces now total two million men, all volunteers; the value of war orders handled by the buppiy Department—and they are not the whole tale of India’s effort m the held of supply—has grown from a monthly average of £4 million during the first sixteen months of the war to an average of £21 million- His Excellency also touched on the problem of food, inflation, and P ost -war planning; and he concluded his review by discussing the political field. He expressed his sharp disappointment that the reluctance to subordinate sectional ambitions to the common interest of the country should still stand m the way of con stitutional progress, and urged Indian public men now that the post-war phase is drawing rapidly nearer, to get. together and hammer out a constitu tion generally acceptable to all the important elements of India s life; the burden is on them and not on His Majesty’s Government. Hindu nationalist comment on the address mostly ignores the record of achievement; and m effect confesses the bankruptcy of political statesmanship by demanding that the Congress leaders (who have shown no signs of a desire to reverse their policy) shall be released. Political .—August 9th, the anniversary of the arrests of the Congress leaders, passed off peacefully. Plans to celebrate the day are known to have been made both by the Congress Socialist, or violent, wing of the party, andby the orthodox non-violent wing. The former proposed to repeat the dis turbances of the previous year, while the latter- intended to organise a march to Poona where Mr. Gandhi is detained, the failure of eithei plan, while due in a measure to the precautions taken by the Government, shows very feeble animation in the body of Congress. ^ ^ The by-elections to the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Frontier Province, referred to in the last Appreciation, have resulted in a strengthening of the Muslim League Ministry. Congress candidates weie returned unopposed to two Hindu seats; but in the four Muslim seats, where in each case there was a straight fight between the Muslim League and the Congress the League candidates were all successful by decisive majorities. These results following on others elsewhere, show the extent to which MuslLs in all parts have shaken off the domination of Congress, they are bound to strengthen the hands of the advocates of Pakistan. In Bengal loo the Muslim League gained ground when the Ministry won a debate m the Legislative 1 Assembly on the° all-important subject of food by a large margin Mr Jinnah was attacked and slightly wounded by a Muslim agitftor at the end of July. It is not yet clear whether the assault was premeditated; its main effect has been further to alienate the League and the Khaksar organisation, of which the assailant was a member- ; The Working Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha met at the beginning of August and pissed a resolution expounding the pohcy of the Mahasabha towards the formation of coalition Ministries m the Provinces; but its mam thlme^as opposition to Pakistan. There are still no signs that a Ministry is likely to be formed in any of the five Provinces which remain undei “Section 93” administration. , „ n ' The Central Legislature has been in session The food situation has attracted much attention, and both Houses have debated the matter at some attracted 1 feelin is that the Central Government must exercise A and firmer control over the distribution of supplies.

The technical hitch about the Budget in Bengal, mentioned in Appreciation To. 7, has necessitated the resummoning of the Assembly; the Opposition are unlikely to refrain from making political capital out of the food situation, of which they themselves were a principal cause. In the Punjab, the controversy about the status of the Muslim Leagmv members of the Ministry and Legislative Assembly continues, but so far Mr. Jinnah has not attempted to enforce his opinion that they owe allegiance primarily to the League, and only secondarily to the Unionist Party. The Unionist Party is a Coalition of M.uslims, Hindus and Sikhs under the aegis of which the members were elected in 1937. Since then it has remained in power, but is now under severe pressure from the Muslim League. General .—The second all-India Labour Conference, attended by Govern ment delegates from Provinces and States and by representatives of all the important organisations of both employers and employees, was held in Delhi at the beginning of September. Dr. Ambedkar, the Labour Member of the Viceroy's. Executive Council, said that though the Conference owed its genesis to the exigencies of the war, it would be an institution with a permanent place in the economic structure of the country. With the growing industrialisation of India, the importance of maintaining good relations between employers and employees, and of securing a reasonable standard of living for the latter, needs no stressing. In Appreciation No. 5 of 1943 it was mentioned that the Governor- General had promulgated an Ordinance rectifying a defect in the Defence of India rule under which large numbers of Congressmen and other persons are held in detention. The validity of this Ordinance has itself been challenged in four High Courts; but only the Calcutta High Court held it to be invalid, on the ground that the Governor-General had no power by an Ordinance directlv to amend or repeal an Act of the Central Legislature. The ledeiol Court 'have recently given a unanimous decision that the clause of the Ordinance validating rest respectively all orders of detention is valid and effective. They did not consider it necessary to come to a decision about the extent of the Governor-General’s Ordinance-making powers. As regards the particular cases on appeal from the Calcutta High Court, serious fault was found with the procedure observed by the Provincial Government m issuing orders of detention and eight appeals by the Provincial Government against orders releasing detenus were rejected. The matter is interesting as showing the continued independence of the judiciary in time of Avar. The North-West Frontier remains quiet. In Waziristan the activities of the Faqir of Ipi and other religious notables caused some rise in tempera ture, but the advent of the holy month of Ramzan when Muslims fast has had a general quietening effect.■■■■■■■■ CONFIDENTIAL.

No. 10 of the 19^3 Series, October 16th, 1943. India and the War .—The success of the Allies on all fronts produces in India an atmosphere of complacence and security in which no close atten tion is paid to details. But the recent arrival of Lord Louis Mountbatten in Delhi has strengthened expectations of an early offensive in Burma—the outcome of which is eagerly awaited by those who ignorantly assume that the occupation of that country will immediately solve the problem of India's shortage of rice. The dropping of a few bombs on Madras on the night of October llth-12ch was the first attack on India from the air for more than four months; the loss of life and damage to property were negligible. The award of a V.C. to a Gurkha Havildar brings the number of V.C.’s won by the Indian Army in this war up to seven, of which six have gone to Indians or Gurkhas. The Food Conference held last July (see the Appreciation of that month) set up a committee to frame a long-term food policy. The committee s report, lately published, has had a generally favourable reception. Their main recommendations are that imports are essential in order to create a central reserve of foodgrains of half a million tons in addition to maintaining an annual nett inflow of one million tons; that rationing should be introduced forthwith in the 58 towns with population exceeding 100,000 and progres sively extended; that statutory price control should be instituted for all the principal foodgrains in all provinces; and that the present method of distri bution, subject to central supervision should be continued. In his opening address at a Conference of representatives of Provinces and States assembled in Delhi on 13th October to consider the committee’s report the Food Member of the Government of India, Sir J. P. Srivastava, announced that some of the recommendations had already been accepted by the Government of India, including that in regard to imports. In the House of Commons on the previous day Mr. Amery in the course of a detailed statement said that His Majesty’s Government 'had made every effort to provide shipping for imports, and considerable quantities of foodgrains are now arriving m India or are due to arrive before the end of the, year. As regards the situation in Bengal (which is still very grave) he said that while His Majesty's Govern ment would not hesitate to take or to authorise the Government of India to take, all necessary measures of assistance, the primary responsibility lay on the Provincial Government and Legislature. Sir J. P. Srivastava has made it clear that the Centre, in mobilising the food resources of the country, would not hesitate to use all its powers of superintendence and control overI I the local administrations. The necessity of such control is in fact generally recognised, and its extension demanded, however jealously its working is watched by interested parties in the more fortunate areas. An Ordinance against hoarding and profiteering has just been issued. It covers articles other than food and those over which controls are already working; but it should react on food supplies and prices by enabling the cultivator to obtain at reasonable rates the commodities he requires. Political .—On 14th October Lord Linlithgow in a farewell address to the Chamber of Princes paid a warm tribute to the war effort of the Indian States, and to their co-operation with British India in attacking the problems of food, cloth and inflation. The Viceroy reaffirmed his faith in the Federal ideal; the unity of India, he said, was wholly consistent with the survival and orderly development of the States; but the Crown’s obligations to protect the States carried equally binding responsibilities to ensure that they continued to be worthy of protection; he appealed to the Princely Order to exercise ‘‘such vigour and foresight, such judicial blending of old and new, such subordination of narrow personal and local interests to true patriotism, that the future of India might be ensured”. The political calm of the country is slightly stirred by some expecta tions arising from the succession of Lord Waved to Lord Linlithgow in the near future. Peaceful conditions have made possible the release during the past two months of large numbers of unimportant prisoners arrested during the Congress rebellion; no political significance attaches to this, though persons eager to see the Congress resuscitated profess to believe that it heralds a general amnesty by the new Viceroy. The depth of the depression into which the Congress has sunk is shown by the lack of interest in Mr. Gandhi s birthday (his 74th)-—an occasion usually celebrated by a “week” of meetings and processions; and the collapse of the pretensions of Congress is reflected in the appeal of Mr. Rajagopalachari that politicians outside prison should abandon their dependency on those inside and “organise national acceptance” of the Cripps offer. He does not hesitate to admit that the withdrawal of the Congress Ministries in 1939 (which was led by himself) was an error of tactics; and he describes the rejection of the Cripps offer as betraying a lamentable lack of foresight. General .—The monsoon has been generally satisfactory in quantity and distribution, and crop prospects are good. But floods of some severity have occurred in parts of the United Provinces and Madras. No serious communal disturbance has occurred during the recent important Muslim and Hindu festivals, and it appears that in this respect the record of 1943 will be as good as that of 1942.ill 1 lii ■ ■ CONFIDENTIAL. \ v .

India and the War. 'Hie appetite for victories finds the Russian record satisfying, and contrasts it with the toilsome; progress of our forces (which nclude Indian troops) in Italy. Successes in the distant Pacific are less regarded than any signs of advance into Burma. The few Japanese attacks m the North-East frontier and Madras from the air have excited httre interest and no alarm. The Guildhall speech of Mr. Churchill and Marshal Stalin’s pronouncement have impressed on public opinion not only the magnitude of the Russian gains but also the great contribution which the British and Americans have made towards them by the operations m bouth Europe, the bombing of the enemy’s cities, and the provision of supplies; and have confirmed hopes that the enemy in Europe will be defeated next year at the latest. Some stir has been caused by events in the Lebanon; Indian opinion in general suspects the French of backsliding into “Imperialism ; Muslim opinion while sharing this suspicion, approves the attitude of His Majesty s Government. The appointment of an Australian High Commissioner in India Field-Marshal Smuts' offer of food, and the arrival of six food ships during the month have tended to reassure India of the sympathy of the Commonwealth with her difficulties. Political —Lord Linlithgow’s departure was the occasion for reflections on the “barren record” of his Viceroyalty in newspapers whose sympathies are with the Congress—the party through whose tactics his hopes for t le political advancement of India were in fact defeated and the eommuna obstacles to unity heightened. Expectations of a gesture from Loid Waved have died down; but his visit to afflicted areas m Bengal within a week of his arrival and the provision of generous military aid in the distri bution of food to those areas have aroused warm approval m all quarters. Calcutta and some country districts of Bengal are still grievously stricken. Mr Amery told the House of Commons that about 8,000 persons died m Calcutta between August 15th and October 16th from causes directly or indirectly due to malnutrition; and that conditions m certain districts (foi which no reliable figures are available) have been worse than m Calcntta. Belief has now been organised throughout the countryside; over 3,300 tons of grain have been arriving in Calcutta daily; and there is reason to hope that the worst of the famine is over. But some of the conditions which determine the future are bound to be uncertain; and problems of health will be serious for some time. The tone of the debate in the House of Commons on November4th was recognised in India as helpful and sympathetic. The Central Assembly have been debating the food situation for four days; and have negatived proposals for an enquiry. The Council and Working Committee of the Muslim League have been in session at Delhi. In five of the six Provinces where Ministries are now working the Premiers are Muslims; and four of these have attended the League meetings. Whatever view may be taken of the exercise by the League, under Mr. Jinnah's leadership, of a control over Provincial Ministries comparable with that which the Congress high command employed in 1937—jl 39, it may be hoped that the opportunity will be taken to further the food'* policy of the Central Government in obtaining the full co-operation of ‘‘surplus” Provinces and assimilating provincial measures in such matters as rationing and price control. The session of the Central Assembly opened on the 8th November with a defeat for the Government;. the subject under discussion was a decision of the Government to send a delegation of four persons to make known abroad the extent of India’s war effort. The defeat was significant mainly from its being caused by the return of a number of Congress members to the Assembly, from which (except for the occasion of a Finance Bill in November 1940) they have absented themselves for four years. The “high command” having been silenced, the decision to return was taken by a group of members indepen dently. The principal topic in the Assembly has naturally been the food situation. The Government have accepted a resolution which recommended them to give the foremost place in their monetary policy to the stabilisation of prices. A Government Bill has been introduced to amend the Indian Trade Unions Act so as to compel the recognition of Unions by employers, under certain conditions relating to membership. General .—Conditions on the North-West Frontier have been quiet; and the same can be said of the rest of the country.CONFIDENTIAL. / One copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No, J_ of 1944, series, which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Governor-General (Public), New Delhi, tha.^/f-k...

India and the War .—The Russian successes, including the crossing of the 1939 frontier of Poland, are fully appreciated in India. The difficulties which hold up the British and American forces in Italy are less understood. The advance in Arakan, where Maungdaw has recently been captured, is welcome. There was speculation as to the slight losses suffered by the Japanese when they bombed Calcutta in mid-December; but the failure of the raid on Chittagong on December 26th and the smashing victory on the morning of December 31st over the force which attempted to interfere with our planes returning from the bombing of Ramree Island have restored confidence. The danger to India from Japan by sea and land has long been discounted by popular opinion. In the November Appreciation mention was made of the aid given by the Army, on the initiative of Lord Wavell immediately after he became Viceroy, to the afflicted areas in Bengal. Not only in the distribution of food but also in the fight against disease resulting from the famine of last year, relief has been rapid and thorough, and the Army has won the gratitude of the people. The Viceroy, in addressing the Associated Chambers of Commerce in Calcutta on December 20th, referred to the generous measure of assistance given to Bengal by the Central Government in other respects also : and added that the solution of Bengal’s food problem now lies in Bengal’s hands: the Central Government cannot continue indefinitely to “ carry ” a Province to which Nature has vouchsafed so generous a crop, if through administrative inefficiency the Province fails to secure that it is properly procured and distributed. It is not yet certain that the best possible use will be made of the crop ; and there seems no good reason why the price of rice in Bengal should again be rising. The appointment of Mr. Casey to the Governorship of Bengal has been received with approval on personal grounds and as a recognition of the importance of the problems now facing the Bengal administration : at the same time it has been condemned by nationalists on the ground of the exclusion of Indians from Australia.National Defence Council has just finished a session in Delhi. A new feature .-of its deliberations was an address by Lord Louis Mountbatten on the work of South-East Asia Command. Political .—Viceroy in his Calcutta speech said that he did not believ# ' he could make the solution of the constitutional and political problems of India easier by talking about them at present; the winning of the war, the organisa tion of the economic home front, and the preparation for peace call for the use of all the resources of the country in determination, energy and intelligence ; but he would weicome co-operation from any quarter in the achievement of the great administrative aims which should be common to all parties when the country is in peril, and thereby conditions would be produced in which the solution of the political deadlock would be possible. During the Christmas season the political parties (other than the Congress which is still in eclipse) have as usual held conferences and made pronounce ments. At the session of the All-India Muslim League at Karachi Mr. Jinnah invented a new slogan—the British should “ divide and quit ”; but otherwise the only novelty was the establishment of a “committee of action” to organise Muslims all over India to resist the imposition of a unitary constitution and to prepare for the coming struggle for the achievement of* Pakistan. On the other band the All-India Hindu Mahasabha, meeting at Amritsar, demanded the preservation of the integrity of India, the introduction of Eederation with a strong centre, and the refusal to any Province, community or section of the right iO secede. It is once more clear therefore that the aims of these two bodies cancel out. In their attitude to Congress also they are divergent; the Muslim League maintains its hostility to Congress policy, whereas the Mahasabha demands the immediate release of the Congress leaders and other political prisoners. The National Liberal Eederation, meeting at Bombay, also desired the release of the Congress leaders, in the hope (for which no grounds were stated) that they w r ouid defer to popular opinion and abandon the policy which led to the rebellion of August 1912. General.- there has been some restlessness in Whziristan, culminating in an attack upon troops near Razraak. Order lias, however, been restored. India as a whole is tranquil and the economic condition of the country has certainly improved.

No. 2 of the 1944 Series, February 17th, 1944, India and the War .—India continues to admire the Russian victories, and to contrast them with the slow progress in Italy, and also now in Arakan. Progress in the Pacific, and statements such as those recently made by official spokesmen in the Central Legislature on India’s part in the war, have quickened interest in the preparation for major offensive operations against Japan by sea, land and air. These statements have stressed the immensity of the task; as a military authority put it—“ India is doing very well, but she can do better’ 5 . The economic situation calls for little remark, except as regards Bengal (where Mr. Casey assumed office as Governor on January 22nd). Rationing has begun in Calcutta, and in other respects also progress is being made both in providing food at reasonable prices and in dealing with the urgent problems of public health ; but much has still to be done before the Province can be regarded as safe from starvation and disease. Lord Wavell’s first address to the Central Legislature at a joint session of the Chambers on Eebruary 17th was eagerly awaited, especially in political circles. On the theme of the war, he said that as a soldier he knew perhaps better than anyone what the United Nations owe to India, and he would do his best to see that the debt is acknowledged and paid. His first task he defined as “ to assist the South-East Asia Command to drive the enemy from the _ gates of India. There can be no peace or prosperity for India or anyone else till the Japanese ambitions are utterly destroyed”. After discussing the current economic problems, in particular those relating to food, inflation, transportation and coal, he turned to those that would confront India after the war: first, the “ winding-up ” process that follows all wars—the demobilization and resettle ment of soldiers, the termination of war-time contracts with industry, the orderly return of industrial labour to peace-time tasks, the dispersal of property and stocks of goods acquired for war purposes. Then “ our great aim must be to plan for economic and social development so as to raise our standards of living and general welfare Our rate of progress must no longer be at bullock-cart standard but at least at the pace of the handy and serviceable jeep”. This development is being dealt with by a committee of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, assisted by a number of other committees with a strong non-official element; already an educational plan has been formulated anda report on medicine and public health will follow. The Viceroy welcomed the outline of a plan of economic development recently propounded by eight prominent Indian businessmen, whose objects—a substantial increase in standards of living and social welfare—are the same as those of his Government. The Viceroy continued—“ It is more difficult at present to plan India's political future in any detail ”, He could state what he knew to be the desire of practically the whole of the British people, of His'Majesty s present Government, and, he was confident, of any future Government of the United Kingdom—to see India a prosperous and united country, enjoying at an early date complete and unqualified self-government as a whiling partner of the British Commonwealth—for in such association India can best find security and help in the testing years ahead, and peace in the East can so be best assured. This desire is qualified only by an absolute determination to let nothing stand in the way of the earliest possible defeat of Germany and Japan, and by a resolve to see that in the solution of the consti tutional problem full account is taken of the interests of those wffio have supported us—the soldiers (“ the largest forces ever raised in history by voluntary enlistment”;, the people w r ho have worked w r ith us, the Rulers and populations of the States, and the minorities. The Viceroy restated the ‘ c Cripps offer” of March 1942. That offer, he said, is still open, to those who have a genuine desire to further the prosecution of the w r ar and the welfare of India. But the demand for the release of the Congress leaders who are in detention is an utterly barren one till there is some sign on their part of willingness to co-operate in, the great tasks ahead. Of these tasks one of the- greatest is the preliminary examination of the constitutional problems of India by an authoritative body of Indians. The Government -Would be ready to give this body every assistance it might desire in cirrying out its task ; and Indians are free to devise, if they can, a method which will produce agreement in the country more readily than the Cripps proposals. On tne main problem of Indian unity Lord Wavell declared that “ you cannot alter geography India is a natural unit: but it is for Indians to decide the arrangements for two great communities and certain other important minorities, as well as the Indian States, to live within that unit and to make the best uSe of its wealth and opportunities. Of the Congress Lord Wavell said—“I recognise how much ability and high-mindedness it contains, but I deplore its present policy and methods as barren wnd unpractical. I should like to have the co-operation of this element in solving the present and future problems of India. If its leaders feel that they cannot consent to take part in the present Government of India, they may still be able to assist in considering future problems ’’—but those responsible for the declaration of August 8th, 1942, could not be released till the policy of non-co-operation and obstruction had been withdrawn. In commending to Indians “ coalition government by Indians for Indians ” as a not impossible ideal, Lord Wavcll3 quoted as instances both the Centre and the Punjab (where it has been carried on for nearly seven years with conspicuous success). “Had all Provinces worked the 1935 Act in the same spirit and with the same efficiency, India would now be very close to complete self-government.” Pinally, likening the progress to that goal to the climbing of a steep and difficult mountain, where the last cliffs are the most baffling of all, the Viceroy spoke of the splendour of the view to be won from the summit—*' the prospect of an India at peace with herself, a partner in our great Commonweath of Nations, the mother of a great people, a shield for peace in the East, busy and prosperous, yet with leisure to develop the thought and poetry and art which are the real salt of life and of which India has already contributed much to the world Political .—The feebleness of the Congress organization is shewn by its failure to whip up any interest in “Independence Day” (January 26th) when it is customary for members of the party to meet and recite a seditious pledge. Only one member of the Congress Working Committee is at large—a lady, who was released ten months ago on the ground of ill-health. She has so far recovered as to be able to tour the country and (till the Government directed her to refrain from doing so) make statements and speeches in furtherance of the Congress cause. These showed clearly that there is no desire to recant on her own part or on the part of those who are detained (as she was) along with Mr. Gandhi. A motiop to censure the Government for restraining her from further political utterance was defeated on the first day (February 7th) of the session of the Central Legislative Assembly. On the following day a resolution recommending the release of political prisoners in order to “ remove the deadlock and further the war effort ” was negatived without a division. The Government were however defeated by one vote on a motion which found fault with certain action taken in some Provinces in working the Defence of India Rules. North- West Frontier .—In Waziristan, there has been some trouble ; this has been only local, but it has been necessary to take punitive air action in several areas. The Faqir of Ipi has recently emerged from his fastness on the Afghan border and is at present in difficult country in the heart of Waziristan where he is renewing his efforts to reconcile the two major tribes of the country, in the hope of uniting them against the Government. It is doubtful whether his influence is now sufficient to overcome the deep-rooted hostility which exists between these tribes. 22AGG— 123—28-2-44—PSVPDmmmm- One copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No* 3 of 1944, series, which has been prepared for ccnminication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Go vein or General (Public).

India and the War. —Mr. Churchill's recent review of the achievements of the British and Imperial Forces and of the path to be trodden before victory is won was a valuable tonic for both querulousness and complacency. A section of the press, and of educated opinion, had been accustomed to disparage the efforts of the British and Imperial Forces in comparison with the successes of Russia. Though little credence has been given to the confident boasting of the Japanese and their friend Subhas Bose that Jap troops, accompanied by the Indian National Army, were on the point of sweeping us out of Burma and marching on Delhi, there has been scepticism about our ability to defeat the enemy in the jungles of Burma. This has been silenced by the victory of the Fourteenth Army which has earned the praise of the Prime Minister as well as of the Viceroy, the Supreme Commander and the Commander-in-Chief. There is now a lively expectation of further progress both in the Arakan and further north. India’s fifth War Budget was presented to the Legislature on February 29th. The revenue deficit 'at the end of the year 1943-44 is expected to be nearly £70 million. For 1944-45 the revenue at the existing level of taxation is estimated at £214 million, defence expenditure at £208 million, and civil expenditure at £64 million: total expenditure £272 million. Thus the prospective revenue deficit is £58 million. This deficit is to be^ met to the extent of £17 million by new taxation—increased taxes on incomes, an increased excise on tobacco, and new excises on betel-nuts, coffee and tea. The Finance Member’s statement on the Budget made the following points : In many respects the economic situation, though still giving cause for anxiety, has Greatly improved. The Government of India have made it clear that no further substantial increases in the over-all quantum of war demands on India s . resources can be met without grave risk of economic collapse, and that the ; release for vital civil needs of certain types of supplies and productive capacity at present appropriated for war purposes is essential to counteract the unhealthy tendencies now manifesting themselves. During the year the land forces in India reached approximately the strength held to be necessary •and sufficient for local defence; if they exceed that strength the cost of the excess will not fall on India. The air forces in India have now r grown so as to be much in excess of the strength necessary for defence : here again India s liability is limited to that strength. The allocation of defence expenditure between India and the U. K. thus continues to be governed by the terms and2 y principles of the financial settlement of November 1939 ; developments in the war situation and the establishment of the South-East Asia Command have not rendered it necessary to depart from those principles. Though negotiations for a direct agreement with the U.S.A. have been suspended, India has accepted the principles underlying mutual aid, and continues to receive lend- lease goods and services from the U.S.A. and to grant reciprocal aid in return ; the total of the latter up to the end of 1944-45 is expected to be £61 million. ^ ^ The Finance Member dealt at length with the dangers of inflation, and the steps taken to meet them. The problem takes a special form in India because more than half the war expenditure is incurred by His Majesty’s Government and other Allied Governments. India’s troubles have arisen from inability always to raise sufficient rupees from the market to finance the recoverable war expenditure. “ It cannot be repeated too often or too widely that in their own interests the people of a country at war must c save and lend’.” During the last year nearly three times as large a sum has been obtained by various forms of public borrowing as in the previous years: the total in the year is nearly £210 million. By way of anti-inflationary measures, in addition to the controlled distribution of foodgrains and other commodities at reasonable prices, Government’s object is on the one hand to restrict spending by the public on the limited supply of consumer goods and on the other to canalise purchasing power into Govern ment securities or into activities, such as the production of consumer goods, which will alleviate present scarcity or help in the immediate post-war period. Physical controls by Government are handicapped not only by the vast size and educational backwardness of the country but also by lack of experienced and capable staff. India’s sterling credits have continued to grow and the holdings of the Reserve Bank now amount to about £712 million. The past year has seen the final stage in the repatriation of India’s public debt, amounting to about £350 million. The Finance Member concluded his review with comment on plans for post-war reconstruction. For this the first requisite is a sound financial position, both at the Centre and in the Provinces, secured by the fullest ^ development of their respective taxation resources. Many Provinces have B made a start in building up funds. As regards the Centre after the war, if ™ ^ certain conditions are realised, it may well be that after one or two deficit years revenue surpluses will emerge rising in the fourth or fifth year to £75 million a year; with borrowing continued in the manner developed during the w r ar, perhaps £750 million will be available for the purposes of reconstruction in the . first effective quinquennium. The immediate task of investigation and planning is already well in hand. One feature of the Budget—the raising of the minimum liable to income- tax—has been welcomed as easing the burden borne by people of modest meanswho are hard hit by high prices. In other respects the budget has been received with as much equanimity as could be expected. Political, —The reception of Lord Wavell’s address to the Central Legislature, summarised in the last Appreciation, shows that India still speaks with many and discordant voices. His refusal to release the Congress leaders unless there is a change of heart is condemned by Hindu Nationalists, while Mr. Jinn ah strangely accuses him of te fishing in Congress waters”. But less partisan opinion has welcomed his frankness, his desire to further progress in constitutional planning and in political agreement, and his determination to see a happier and more prosperous India. The death of Mrs. Gandhi at a great age on February 22nd caused wide-spread sorrow: the fact that she was sharing her husband’s detention has led to some attempts to make political capital of her death. In the Central Legislative Assembly a number of Congress members have made their appearance, without the approval of their leaders. They have of course voted consistently against the Government; and, as the Muslim League has generally done the same, the Government have suffered several defeats. The railway budget proposed a 25 per cent, increase in passenger fares—a measure which has been condemned by all parties; and in the present mood of the House the prospect of the Finance Bill obtaining a majority is more than doubtful. Outside the Legislature, Muslim opinion has shown some restiveness over a reported design in the U.S.A. to encourage Zionist ambitions in Palestine and over the breakdown of deliberations between Britain and Turkey. North-West Frontier .—The Faqir of Ipi is still in central Waziristam punitive air action having failed to induce the local tribes to eject him. On the other hand, the tribes as a whole in Waziristan show no inclination to support the Faqir’s design of general hostilities against Government. 1 , 30AGG—123 -27-3-44—PSVPD[Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 4 of the 1944 Series, April 15th, 1944- India and the War .—The first incursion by the enemy on to Indian soil * which occurred in Manipur State towards the end of March has come at a time when the Allies are well prepared to meet it. Two years ago, an invasion in any strength, would have been a much more serious matter. There is some surprise in the country that the Japanese should have been able to penetrate so far and to cut the roads leading to Imphal; but there is no real alarm, and in Assam, the threatened Province, the public are reported to be cheerful, and Mr. Gopinath Bardoloi, once Congress Premier, has issued an appeal for united defence of the Province, irresnective of political differences. The continued successes of the Russian armies evoke widespread admiration: but opinion which expected too easy an advance in Italy remains discouraged, and inclined to question the strength and resolution of Allied efforts. Of the substance of India’s contribution to the war-effort Mr. Churchill made mention on April 4th: in the past four vears of war, India’s casualties numbered 109,800, made up of 5,912 killed, 17,181 missing, 13.230 wounded, and 7.2,848 prisoners of war (including 58,221 officers and other ranks missing but presumed prisoners of war). The controversy over the future of immigra tion into Palestine still excites some interest, especially in Muslim circles, where Britain is adjured “not to sell out the Arabs”. The Government is gradually extending control of the food situation in the country: a notable decision was taken early in April to control (for the first time) both the maximum and minimum prices of wheat in the principal wheat-producing areas. Four Provincial Governments—the Punjab, Sind, the North-West Frontier Province and the United Provinces— have notified their respective maximum prices for the spring wheat crop; and the Central Government have offered to purchase at Rs. 7-8 per unit of 82 lb. ^ any wheat that has not fetched a better price. Unfortunately, unseasonable ' rains in the wheat-growing areas have adversely affected what was thought likely to prove an exceptional harvest: and it now seems likely that the out turn will be no better than, or perhaps below, average. In Bengal. the Governor broadcast on April 1st an appraisement of the situation in the Province and gave a number of reasons why a recurrence of famine need not be expected this year; last vear there was a particularly poor rice crop further damaged bv a, cyclone—but this vear the cron promised to be very good; last year, Calcutta depended upon Bengal to feed her—butshe was-n^w a responsibility of the Centre; further, the organisation of di&amp;tinbution ahjd procurement has been greatly developed of late; and transport arrangements were being constantly improved. Political .—The budget proposals were noted in Appreciation No. 3: after a hard debate of six days’ length, the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the Nationalists defeated the Finance Bill by 56 votes to 55; the Europeans and 10 non-official Indians voted with the Government. In his closing speech for the Opposition Mr. Bhulabhai Desai pleaded that he was not opposed to defending his country, but would not undertake the % “responsibility” of voting the taxes without the “privilege” of _ directing their expenditure This was the first rejection of a Finance Bill since 1940: the certificated Bill was defeated on the following day by a larger majority (because of the absence of a number of Government supporters): the Bill, however, was passed by the Council of State. Towards the end of the Session it was announced that the defeated proposals for increased railway fares (also mentioned in the last Appreciation) would be dropped: this was a popular decision, and was welcomed as a substantial response to the wishes of the Legislature. The reverses suffered by the Government in the session were due to the return of several Congress members from their voluntary exile and to the steady adherence of the Muslim members to the Opposition cause. The reasons for this alliance are obscure, and it is difficult to believe them of any general significance. There was also a cut motion to refuse the grant for the Executive Council which was the occasion for some vituperation against Members of Council : these attacks were met by Dr. Khare, Member for Commonwealth Delations, who castigated the Congress for their unwilling ness to assist in the government of the country; their hostility to those who were prepared to carry on the administration in their absence; and for the “irresponsibility” of their attacks and the unconstructiveness of their policy in time of war. In the country, political interest has been more drawn to an attempt by Mr. Jinnah at Lahore to induce the Punjab Ministry to consent to the dissolu tion of the Unionist Party in the Punjab and to its replacement by a coalition of parties dominated by'the Muslim League. This venture seems to have met with little success; and Mr. Jinnah, after striking an overbearing note ^ in a number of public pronouncements, was obliged to return to Delhi with his mission unfulfilled: he has, however, promised to revisit the Punjab shortly in further pursuit of his plans. Moderate and “non-party” politics have been characterised by many suggestions and much discussion—but by little progress. A proposal by Pandit Medan Mohan Malaviya to summon an All-Parties Conference has not fructified—one reason for its failure being Mr. Jinnah’s hostility, andanother the lukewarm reception accorded it by much Hindu political opinion. Mr. Kajagopalachari and others have travelled many miles and discussed this and other proposals: but all their deliberations have so far come to nothing. At a Non-Party Conference at Lucknow, Sir T. B. Sapru talked of the frustration caused by the c ‘immobility of the Government” which would neither make proposals nor encourage them from others, and pleaded for a restoration of ministerial government in Section 93 Provinces, and a “national” government at the Centre; resolutions in this vein were also c^ried; but no constructive proposals for the securing of political agreement were made beyond a reiteration of the old demand for ‘release of the Congress leaders for a “National Conference” to be held for the settlement of political problems. North-West Frontier .—The efforts of the Faqir of Ipi have gained little suppo rt among the tribes; and he is believed to have returned once again to his hiding-place on the Afghan border. 39AGG -123— 1 -5 -44-P S V P D.confidential One copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India INo. 5 f of 1944 series, which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Governor-General (Public).

No. 5 of the 1944 Series, May 18th, 1944- India and the War .—The month has seen hard fighting in the Kohima area; but as the Allies have wrested the upper hand the truth of the Dommander-in-Ghief’s description of the Japanese incursion as a “token invasion'’ has been generally acknowledged. Early in May Sir Sultan Ahmed, the Information Member of Council, visited the front and has spoken encouragingly of the confidence of the troops and of the exaggerations of Japanese propaganda. The recent recovery of Kohima ridge and the killing of 3,000 Japanese soldiers made a very heartening impression. Apart from the success of the defence, the physical invasion of India, even in a remote and sparsely populated area, has steadied public feeling as nothing else would have done. The acceleration of Allied bombing over Western Europe, and the open ing of the new offensive in Italy have strengthened belief in the Allied determination to finish off Germany. The transfer of the headquarters of the South East Asia Command to Ceylon and the naval raid on Sabang have also done something to restore belief in Allied determination to strike eastwards. The Conference of Dominions Premiers in London has provoked interest. India’s two representatives in the War Cabinet, the Maharaja of Kashmir and Sir Firoz Khan Noon, participated closely in the discussions. On 14th April (but too late for report in the last Appreciation) there occurred at Bombay serious explosions in some ships containing ammunition which further set alight a portion of the docks and of the city. Thanks to the magnificent efforts of the Fighting and Auxiliary Services and of the City Fire Brigade and A.R.P., the flames were brought under control—but not before some 480 persons had been killed and above 2,000 injured, of whom 800 are detained in hospital. About 40,000 tons of grains were destroyed; but the damaged area of the port has for the greater part been quickly put back into commission. The citizens were calm and public co-operation excellent. A Committee of Inquiry consisting of the Chief Justice, a retired Indian High Court Judge and a Rear-Admiral has been appointed to investi gate the causes of the accident. Security demands that the Committee s proceedings should be held in camera, but those parts of its conclusions that can be safely disclosed will be published. Much has been done in the Provinces to stimulate the recent Defence . Savings Drive. Most of the Provinces have outdistanced the targets which they first set themselves for investment in defence loans, many by a great2 - y&gt;t ^ A / space. VChe effect on the crops of the unseasonal rains reported last month is now found to he greater on quality than on quantity in most Provinces. At the end of April H.E. Mr. Casey visited Delhi and gave a statement in which he explained the continuing danger to Bengal’s eo momy occasioned by the war. A few months ago, a group of industrialists propounded a scheme of economic deveiopmeno for doubling the wealth of ti e country during the 15 years following the war at a total cost of £7,500 millions. In April the authors of this were invited to discuss it with the Reconstruction Sub-Committee of the Viceroy’s Executive Council. Much attention is being devoted by Provincial and State Governments to the prepa ration of hydro-electric and of irrigation schemes. Political. —Mr. Jinnah followed up his visit to Lahore, reported in the last Appreciation, with a second and conducted exhaustive negotiations with the Punjab Premier. These broke down completely on 27th April. The Premier issued a statement explaining that while he had always been loyal to the League, loyalty to his colleagues and to the traditions of the Unionist Party and to the Sikander-Jinnah Pact forbade him to accept Mr. Jinnah’s proposal for a ‘‘Muslim League Coalition” : in this attitude he has been well supported by his Sikh and Hindu colleagues. The Premier’s decision was a serious rebuff for Mr. Jinnah who, however, has mk given up the struggle. The Committee of Action of the League has called upon the Premier for a statement of his case with a view to taking disciplinary action, but he has declined the challenge. In the middle of April Mr. Gandhi had an attack of malaria from which he did not make a quick recovery. There were grounds for fear of a sudden collapse, and he was released unconditionally on 6th May, solely on medical grounds’. The decision has evoked a chorus of approbation and apparent goodwill. This may demonstrate chiefly the affection in which Mr. Gandhi is held bv his followers. But there is a widespread anticipation of political developments, for which no solid basis is apparent. Meanwhile Mr. Gandhi is devoting his efforts—in a self-imposed fortnight’s silence—to the recovery of his health. The North-West Frontier .—The Eaqir of Ipi has remained in Central Waziristan and his gangs have attempted to interfere with communications. Forces have been used for their control, but no regular troops have been required. The Faqir’s efforts to spread disaffection still command no general tribal support. 47AGG—123—30-5-44—bS ?

No. 6 of the 19UU Series, June 16th, 19^. India and the War .—The events on the war fronts during the last 30 days have fortified all patriots and for the time being silenced all cavillers. The speed and completeness of the victory in Italy, the Japanese withdrawal confessing defeat at Kohima and finally the secure lodgment obtained on-the French coast have profoundly impressed all classes. Appreciation .has been generous in the Indian press of every complexion no less than in the British- owned press. The successes vouchsafed to the Allied strategy have in a moment vindicated the seeiping inertia which preceded them. Confidence is . abroad in respect of every aspect of the war. In particular Japanese propaganda which gained some ground recently is discounted. On June 8th Sir Firoz Khan Noon addressed the Royal Empire Society in Eondon. He held that India as a whole desired to remain a member of the Commonwealth, because India realised that, no matter how powerful she might beqome, she could never “stand alone in the world without friends . He belauded the Cripps offer of 1942—so unfortunately rejected—and re butted the criticism that the Atlantic Charter had not been applied to India—for there existed a Charter already. It having been decided that the time had come to appoint a full-time member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council to take charge of Planning and Development, Sir Ardeshir Dalai, one of the authors of the £7,500 millions (“Bombay”) plan for raising the standard of living and a leading industrial ist, has been given the new portfolio. The problem of India’s sterling balances, which is to be discussed at the international Monetary Conference in Julv by a mission charged with the task of expressing India’s special needs, ' has called forth a great 'deal of public discussion. The Government of India’s orders regarding the compensation to be given for the losses from the Bombay explosions, announced at the end of May,have been generally appreciated no less for the speed with which they were issued than for their comprehensiveness and adequacy. For fully insured property, compensation will be paid at 100%; for uninsured property, at 75%. But for “black market” property nothing will be paid. Belief in cases of death and disablement is to be afforded on a scale more liberal than that provided by the Workmens’ Compensation Act for industrial accidents. The Commission is proceeding with its enquiry into the explosions. Political.—Mi. Gandhi’s recovery is slow, but at the beginning of June he was prevailed upon to undergo treatment for hookworm from which he has been suffering. Meanwhile, he has spent much of his time in silence. Indeed, he accorded the Press on June 12th a silent “interview” at which a very few questions were asked and answered in writing. He has,-however, received many visitors and in particular has been in confer ence with many leaders of moderate and industrial opinion. In the country there continues to be much speculation, but no ‘ sign of any important development in the political arena is yet apparent. There are indications, however, that much moderate and even much Congress opinion would be disappointed by a display of obstinacy on Mr. Gandhi’s part. The long-range battle between Mr. Jinnah and the Punjab Premier, (neither they nor their Lieutenants have met sin'ce April) continues. The Premier has been expelled from the Muslim League; but whether this has affected his influence and standing is doubtful. Most of his supporters have remained true to him, and the Muslim members of his Ministry have, by severing their connection with the League, voluntarily shared his punishment. The League is making intense efforts to gain support in the Punjab, but there are not wanting signs of impatience with a League policy which is splitting Muslim forces. The North-West Frontier .—The Faqir of Ipi is still in Central Waziristan and his followers have inflicted some casualties upon our forces, though they have obtained little support. Punitive action with the aid of the air arm and of the artillery has been taken against them. 57AGG-123—28-6-44—PS VPDJj, Hll CONFIDENTIAL One copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. 7 of 1944 series, which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Governor-General (Public).

Food problems continue to be an ever-present though somewhat less insistent anxiety. The south-west monsoon started fitfully, but has now strengthened. Throughout the wheat producing areas there has appeared a pronounced tendency to withhold produce from the market. Wheat prices r have gradually hardened. Counter-measures are being taken and there can not be said to be in any part of India any immediate fear of famine. But there is great interest in the question of imports and the announcement made on Julvist that the import of 400,000 tons of foodgrams into India since October 1943 has been arranged and almost completed and that 400,000 tons more may be expected by the end of September, if it has not given complete satisfaction, has gone some way to lessening anxiety. Meanwhile, crop procurement is proceeding in all Provinces; maximum prices have been fixed for wheat; and rationing has been extended to nearly every considerable Indian town. Questions of post-war finance and industry continue to command atten tion 1 Within the country, a committee has prepared for the consideration of an Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Itesearch an ambitious scheme for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, with a view to doubling production within 15 years. At Brettonwoods, U.S.A., the Indian official and non-official delegation put forward the sugges tion that the question of sterling balances should be discussed along with the proposal for an international monetary fund. They failed to gam their point because of the general conviction of the Conference that the tasks for which it has assembled were already sufficiently onerous. Political.— On June the 17th, the Government of India published the correspondence which passed between Lord Linlithgow and Lord Waved and the Government of India on the one side and Mr. Gandhi on the other side during the latter’s detention. Mr. Gandhi was largely concerned to prove that the widespread sabotage movement of 1942 had not been planned under Ms direction before his arrest, but was caused by a spontaneous , upvsuige of popular exasperation at his arrest. Though the correspondence discloses two irreconcilable points of view, the effect of the publication has at any rate been to place before the public full and authoritative statements of ihem both A few days later two more letters were released; Mr. Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy expressing a desire to interview the Working Com mittee in order to discuss a fresh approach, and as a pielimmaiy suggested that when he has recovered from his illness he should meet the Viceroy..Lord Wcivell. replied that “in consideration of Lie radical difference in our points&gt;&lt;nHdew, (as evinced in the earlier coiTespondence) '1 feel that a meeting between us at present could have no value...,. Similar considerations apply to your request to see the Working Committee’d He added, however, “If after your convalescence and. on further rellection you have a definite and constructive policy to propose for the furtherance of India’s welfare, I shall be glad to eonsider it”. Since those letters were written, Mr. Gandhi's mind has been active, in two directions. Though he has himself made no approach either to Mr. Jinnah or to the Viceroy, he has subscribed to a formula which Mr. Hajagopalachari has presented to the former and he has published in the Press a proposal for the formation of a “National Government”. The methods he has used for these pronouncements are curious; Mr. Rajagopalachari has been outcastcd from the Congress on account of his leanings towards the principle of Pakistan, which Mr. Gandhi himself has denounced as “a sin” : yet Mr. Rajagopalachari has been chosen as the channel for a message to Mr. Jinnah which in effect commits the Congress to that principle. At the same time Mr. Jinnah’s natural unwillingness to accept on his own responsibility, and without reference to the League, a formula which on the face of it does not amount to acceptance of the League’s claims, has been made the pretext for negotiations to-be terminated. As soon as that was done Mr. Gandhi’s scheme for a “National Govern ment” was made known to a newspaper in England and the Press in India. Under this scheme the independence of India is to be declared; a “National Government responsible to the people of India” is to be appointed at the Centre with full control of the civil administration; the Viceroy’s powers are to be abrogated, except that he and the Commander-in-Chief will have control of military operations. On his side Mr. Gandhi announces that he has no intention of offering civil disobedience today: but he retains the right to use that weapon if India’s right to freedom is thwarted. To the Pakistan proposal Hindu opinion has already shown hostility. The Muslim League Council will presumably consider it when it meets at the end of this month; but Muslim opinion finds difficulty in reconciling it with Mr. Gandhi’s simultaneous declaration that he will not tolerate the “vivisection” of India. The “National Government” which Mr. Gandhi proposes is not compatible with the existing constitution; and His Majesty’s Government have consistently declined to upset that constitution during the war. Therefore it does not appear that Mr. Gandhi has made it easy for his proposals to be accepted in any quarter; and his retention in his armoury of the weapon of civil disobedience is prejudicial to a calm atmosphere. North-West Frontier .—Action taken against the Faqir of Ipi and his followers has discouraged general tribal support; and hostiles are beginning to disperse. The situation is otherwise quiet. 7 OAGG— 123—27-7-44—P S V PI)CONFIDENTIAL One copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. o of 1944 series, which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Governor-General (Public).

No. 8 of the Series, August 16th, 1944- India and the War .—The fall of the Tojo Ministry, the expulsion of the Japanese from the eastern border of India and from North Burma, the attempt on Hitler’s life, the successes of the Allies on the three great fronts in Europe, and now the invasion of southern France, all confirm expecta tions of an early end to the war. That is strongly desired by most people in India, for the discomforts of war-time conditions are irksome. The rehabilitation of the areas—the State of Manipur and a small part of Assam—recovered from the Japanese is in progress. In his review of the war on August 2nd Mr. Churchill paid another tribute to the gallantry of Indian troops in Italy. Both Houses of Parliament debated Indian affairs in the last week of July. Lord Munster and Mr. Amery both covered the whole field of current affairs, with special attention to economic and political conditions. The grave difficulty in finding shipping for the imports of grain sufficient to provide the total recommended in the “Gregory” report—one million tons a year for current use and half a million tons as a reserve—was explained; but there is still a feeling in India that the full amount is needed to make India secure from a recurrence of famine. Mr. Amery’s comments on the recent activities of Mr. Gandhi (mentioned in the last Appreciation) have been carefully studied. While affirming that Great Britain stands by the terms of the Cripps Offer of 1942 in the hour of victory as in the days of adversity, he did not find in Mr. Gandhi’s scheme for a “National Government” any real approximation to those terms. The scheme therefore does not provide a starting-point for discussion or a response to Lord Wavell’s invitation for constructive pro posals. Nor could Mr. Amery find any assurance of the communal agree ment which remains the first prerequisite of any political advance. The monsoon, though in some places excessive and in others defective, is on the. whole developing favourably. What is popularly known as the9 JE$9HHHE1S3EI Famine Enquiry Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir John Woodhead. has begun its work. Political. —Mr. Gandhi followed up his acceptance of Mr. Rajagopalachari’s formula for a Hindu-Muslim settlement (see the last Appreciation) by writing to Mr. Jinnah to propose a meeting with him. This fact was announced by Mr. Jinnah to the Council of the Muslim League which met at Lahore at the end of July. As Mr. Jinnah had agreed to meet Mr. Gandhi, the Council refrained from any discussion of the formula. Mr. Jinnah, however, made it clear that in various respects it falls far short of the Muslim demand for Pakistan. The two leaders have not met since they did so on Lord Linlithgow’s invitation at the Viceroy’s House on November 1st, 1939. On that occasion they showed no desire even to enter on discussion of a communal settlement which would pave the way to parti cipation in the Government. The outcome of the next meeting (fixed for August 19th) is naturally awaited with interest. While it is felt that both the Congress and the League are desirous of an arrangement which would give them large representation in the Government—not so much for the purpose of waging what remains of the war as in preparation for peace and all it will bring—it cannot be said that expectation of an agreement is high. Neither protagonist has ever shown aptitude for negotiation and com promise. Though most Congressmen are too long accustomed to blind acceptance of the Mahatma’s leadership to question his present willingness to commit what he has always denounced as “a sin”, other Hindus (and Sikhs) are frankly apprehensive that whatever happens in these talks, the principle of Pakistan will have been irretrievably conceded. The second anniversary of the arrest of the Congress leaders following on the “Quit India” resolution fell to be celebrated on August 9th. It would have been a tepid affair even if Mr. Gandhi had not discouraged any demonstrations against Government. He made an exception of Bombay; and there in accordance with his instructions a small number of Congress men gave notice to the authorities that they were going to recite the resolu tion in public places. As they defied an order refusing them permission to go in procession for this purpose, they were arrested; but symbolism having been satisfied on both sides they were released the same evening. North-West Frontier .—The disturbances of which the Faqir of Ipi has been the centre have now ceased; and dissensions have broken out among his followers which he has not been able to settle. 98AGfl——2fi-8-44—PSVPD[Confidential.’) APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 9 of the 191iA Series, September 16th, 1944- India and the War .—India has been duly impressed by the reconquest of France, of Rumania, and of Bulgaria, and by the invasion of the borders of Germany both in the East and in the West. The press and public expect complete victory over Germany in a very short time. This confidence colours views on the prospects of the eastern war also. Further gains of territory beyond the Indian border, in Arakan, and in north Burma leave no doubt that the war is being prosecuted with energy and success. The opening of the Quebec Conference has been hailed as meaning that the final steps towards the defeat of Japan are now to be organised . The leakage of a report alleged to have been made by Mr. Phillips after his stay in India as the personal representative of the President of the U.S.A., and of a telegram said to have been sent to His Majesty’s Government by the Government of India in consequence of the publication of that report, has excited much interest and discussion. India has been quick to resent and to condemn the reflections made in the report on the character of the Indian Army and the morale of its officers, and to repudiate the suggestion that Britain and India have not intended to play their full part in the defeat of Japan. Nationalists acclaim that part of the report which repeats and endorses their stock arguments: but there is not much support for the plea that America should now take a hand in Indian affairs: and people fail to see how Mr. Phillips’ remedy for “the present situation” adds anything of substance to the Cripps offer. Mr. Amery has paid a visit to the Indian forces fighting in Italy and has commended the gallant part they have played there. The monsoon, which started late, has made up the normal amount of rainfall; but there are local defects, and in some areas floods have caused serious damage. On the whole prospects are fair. There has been a change for the better in the food situation during the past year; but the margin of safety is still narrow, and India continues to watch anxiously for .adequate import of foodgrains. Political.—On August 18th, some further correspondence between Lord Wavell and Mr. Gandhi was published. On July 15th, Mr. Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy, apologising for the manner in which his scheme of _ a “National Government” was made known to the world (see the July Apprecia tion) but expressing the hope that further attention would now be paid to his previous requests. Lord Wavell’s reply asked for definite and constructive proposals. Mr. Gandhi on July 27th stated his “concrete proposal” : he was prepared to advise the Working Committee to renounce mass civil dis obedience and to give full co-operation in the war effort on two conditions—-a declaration of immediate Indian independence should be made, and a National Government responsible to the Central Assembly should be formed, subject to the proviso that military operations should continue as at present, though without any financial burden upon India. In his reply, dated August 15th, Lord Wavell, while stating that His Majesty’s Government remain jnost anxious that a settlement should be reached, explained why these proposals were quite unacceptable as a basis for discussion. He pointed out that they are very similar to those made by the Congress President to Si$ Stafford Cripps in April 1942 and rejected at that time for reasons given by Mis Majesty’s Government. The British offer to India of unqualified freedom after the war was made conditional upon the framing of a constitution agreed by the main elements of India’s national life and the negotiation of a treaty with Britain. These conditions aimed at safeguarding the racial and religious minorities and the depressed classes, and treaty obligations to the Indian States. During the war it is impossible to alter the constitution, as would be necessary if the Government were to be made responsible to the Central Assembly. Until the war is over, responsibility for defence and military operations cannot be divided from the other responsibilities of Government; and till the new constitution is in operation His Majesty’s Government and the Governor-General must retain their responsibility over the entire field. As regards India’s share in the cost of the war, the existing financial arrangements could only be reopened at the instance of either the British or the Indian Government. The Viceroy repeated the invitation to leaders of the Hindus, Muslims and important minorities to co-operate in a transitional government working within the present constitution. For this government to succeed there must first be agreement in principle between those elements as to the method by which the new constitution should be framed. These letters were published just before the date (August 19th) when Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah were to begin their talks (see the last Appreciation). As Mr. Jinnah was unwell, the * talks began only on September 9th. They are still in progress; no one but the two protagonists is present; and nothing is known as to their trend. There is a general desire for such an agreement as would bring, about acceptance of the Viceroy’s invitation, but uneasiness is grow-* ing among Hindus and Sikhs lest a settlement should concede the Muslim demand for Pakistan. The meeting of the two leaders has in fact brought prominently forward those communal differences which it has been the fashion to attribute to British rule, and has shown how fundamentally they affect the political and constitutional problems of India. The North-West Frontier .—The month has been a quiet one in Waziristan, as is usual during the fast of Ramzan. 113 AGG—123-25-9.44-PSYPD# p [Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. ~No. 10 of the 1944 Series, October 19th, 1944. India and the War .—Public confidence in early victory remains high. There has been agitation for relaxation of A.R.P. restrictions in the east. Mr. Churchill reviewing the war on September 18th described the recent campaign on the Assam-Burma border as the greatest victory so far won against Japan on land. Mr. Amery has dealt faithfully with the libel which calls the Indian troops ^mercenaries’ 5 . He pointed out that they are the largest volunteer army ever raised and asked that their allies and their enemies should be allowed to judge of their quality. These remarks have had the backing of publicists all over India. The Governor of Bengal in a broadcast on 21st September drew a fairly confident picture of the food and health situation in Bengal. Rice was steady in price with a slight downward trend. Apart from malaria, which was very serious, epidemics had been reduced below the normal after 17 million inoculations against cholera and 31 million inoculations against small-pox. Adequate drugs were now available to fight malaria. There has been a fall all over India in the price of wheat but the price of most commodities remains high. Political .—The talks between Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah continued under a veil of secrecy until 26th September when correspondence which accompanied the talks was released and complete failure was announced. The negotiators in fact failed to come together at any point. Mr. Jinnah held to the Muslim League resolution at Lahore of 1940. Muslims and lindus being separate nations must first divide and then obtain independence after which they could of course negotiate as equal sovereign States.^ \ Pakistan or the Muslim States meant the six provinces of the N .-W F.K, Sind, Baluchistan, the Punjab, Bengal and Assam subject to territorial adjustments which would not involve mutilation. These adjustments would, in the light of the Muslims’ right to exercise self-determination as a nation, be determined by a plebiscite of the Muslim inhabitants of the areas. r_ Gandhi held to the Congress resolution of 8th August 1942. Hindus an Muslims were a single nation and must first join together to obtain indepen dence and then form a Provisional Government which would arrange tor matters of joint interest such as defence and foreign affairs and tor tne delimitation of boundaries between the Hindu and Muslim areas on the basis of the votes of all communities within the Muslim area. This area would Up in whieh the Muslims QT1 ~ 1 ^11 Pi munities. In answer to a question in the House of Commons Mr. Amery observed that the situation after the talks offered no hopes for intervention by Govern ment at present. Both leaders tried to disguise their failure by describing the breakdown as an adjournment sine die. But to almost all parties other than Congress and in their individual capacity to a great many Congress men the breakdown came as a relief. Fortunately so far there has been no accentuation of inter-communal bitterness but there cannot be said to be any clear indications of what the next step towards the solution of the political problem will be. Mr. Gandhi’s personal hold on the country was demonstrated by the presentation of a purse of over Rs. 75 lakhs, raised in memory of his wife, on the occasion of his 75th birthday.

No. 11 of the 19H Series, November 16th, 1944. India and the War .—India has been duly impressed by the recent pronouncements of Mr. Churchill and Marshal' Stalin as showing the unity reached and maintained by the Allies in their prosecution of the wai, and from that point of view welcomes the re-election of President Roosevelt. The prospect, suggested by Mr. Churchill, of the war against Japan continu ing till the autumn of 1946 or later is sobering; and there is uneasiness about the will and ability of the Chinese Government to continue the struggle. In the other scale are placed the successes of the Allies in Burma and the Pacific, and Marshal Stalin’s outspoken description of Japan as an aggressor. The Indian Army has lately won its seventeenth V.C. The topic most discussed in the Central Legislature, now m session, has been the food situation. Though the divisions in the Assembly on the subiect went against the Government, criticisms related to details rathei than to the policy now being energetically pursued by the Central Govern ment and by the Provinces under the guidance and with the assistance ot the Centre. In all quarters the need for larger imports of foodgrains has been stressed. For the period October 1943 to the end of 1944 His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom notwithstanding the calls of the great invasion and operational needs elsewhere have designated shipping to carry one million one hundred thousand tons of wheat to India. 'Indians Overseas.—The Assembly has also debated a Government motion that the position of Indians in South Africa and East Africa be taken into consideration. Government had already used the power conferred bv recent legislation to announce that South Africans m India would be subiected to the same disabilities as Indians in South Africa. Jhe debate showed that all parties regard the action lately taken m ► outh Africa as violating the “Pretoria Agreement” of April last and as being injurious to the interests and self-respect of Indians resident there. The motion was carried, with additions desiring that the Indian High Commissioner in South Africa should be recalled and that economic sanctions should be enforced against South Africa and East Africa. This result reflects strong feeling in the countrv—the only doubts being whether economic sanctions may not interfere with the war-effort and also whether they will be really felt by the African territories. , . . . . Political.—The Congress party fis now reviving its organisation throughout the countrv, which had been in abeyance since the suppression of the disturbances of 1942. Mr. Gandhi is threatening to fast again, though without any clear statement of the purpose to be served thereby . The failuie of the negotiations between him and Mr. Jinnah, recorded m the last Appre ciation is proof that so long as Hindus and Muslims accept the domination of these two leaders a solution of the “deadlock” cannot be expected. North-West Frontier .—The month has been quiet, except for an incident due to intrigues against Afghanistan by a person claiming to be a brother of gr-King Amanullah. •i9AGG -123—25-11-44— PVS PD[Confidential.] , - T' , v ,] vr ' ; v ; APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINION^ • ; f ' No. 1 of the 1945 Series, January 16th, 1945. % V ' 'h . '. q z» •- j ^ India and the War .—In Burma and the Pacific recent events, such as the ipture of Akyab, the advance towards Mandalay, and the invasion of aizon, have been exhilarating for India. Against this effect has to be. weighed some depression and restiveness resulting from events in other spheres. The initial success of the German counterattack on the west European front came as a painful surprise. It is now recognised that the Allies have checked it and are gradually turning the tables on the enemy; and the Russian attack from the east is arousing great expectations; but hopes of an early end to the war in Europe have been suspended. More to be deplored than the natural reactions to the varying fortunes of battle are those caused by reports reaching India of v disunion among _ the Allies. Difficulties arising in countries which have been and are being liberated from the German yoke, Poland and Greece in particular, are reported in such a manner as to suggest that the Allies are drifting apart. News about China has tended to give the impression either that the country and Government are in a very bad way or that propaganda to that effect is being encouraged. And suspicion that the principal Allies still lean towards “Imperialism’’ and “power-politics” feeds on material such as President Roosevelt’s reported statement that the “Atlantic Charter” does not exist as a formal document, and stories of Russian designs on Persian oil. Post-war planning in India now fills a large space in the news. The co-ordinated schemes of the Central and Provincial Governments touching agriculture, industry, and “nation-building” of all kinds provide matter almost every day for the radio and the press. For instance, Sir Ardeshir Dalai, the Member for Planning and Development, has announced a decision to set up a National Institute of Economic Research and also a sub-committee of non-official economists to advise the Government on problems of reconstruc- Gon, and has stated that ship-building would be added to India’s in^q^tTies after the war. Another official spokesman announced that it is proposed To establish a Board of Agricultural Economy. A National Savings Fortnight was inaugurated on January-7th,-- mktPolitical .—Those parts of Lord Waved's address to the Associated Chambers of Commerce at Calcutta (see the last Appreciation) that related to the war, to the repayment of Indian sterling balances and to the economic difficulties experienced by the country during the war years were generally well received. Comment on the political part of the address was much as might be expected. Muslims in particular are displeased because the Viceroy stil] doubts the virtue of Pakistan as a panacea for India’s ills: and in otl&gt;/ quarters His Majesty s Government are described as neither desiring noL assisting escape from the “deadlock”. There are however some signs of a healthy stirring in political life. Two parties (the Hindu Mahasabha and the liadical Democrats ) have put forth schemes for a new constitution. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru’s Conciliation Committee, mentioned in the last Appreciation, met for the first time on December 29th. The Committee will get no help from the Muslim League, which with some reason regards most of its members as committed beforehand against Pakistan; and Dr. Ambedkar, Labour Member of the Government of India and leader of the “scheduled castes”, also dislikes the composition of the Committee and is unwilling to co-operate with it. The Committee has framed for circulation to political parties and their leaders a questionnaire which in eight parts coveis most phases of the constitutional problem, including those that touch the Muslims and other minorities and the Indian States, the machinery for bringing a new constitution into existence, and the part that His Majesty’s Government should play in the event of the various communities failing to agree. Four sub-committees have been appointed, to deil respectively with the basis of the constitution (with special reference to Hindu-Muslim rela tions), with the scheduled castes, with other minorities, and with economic and financial aspects. The Committee is expected to have its report ready early in April. J Mr. Gandhi’s health has again given his friends some concern. He is observing a “fast”, but this time from business and not from food. He has nevertheless been strong enough to give some guidance to the so-called “constructive” programme which he launched in the hope of reviving Congress activities after his talks with Mr. Jinnah were broken off in September. 5AGG-123—27-1-45—PSVPD[Confidential.] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 2 of the 1945 Series, February 17th, 1945. India and the War.—Tbe opening of the British-Canadian offensive in Holland and the reduction of some of the strong points m the Siegfried Line the fall of Budapest, the bombing of German cities, and above all the great victories of the Russian armies overcoming all obstacles on the road to Berlin, have again excited hopes of an early end to the war in Europe 1 he con vincing announcement of cordial agreement between Mr. Churchill, President Roosevelt and Marshal Stalin at the Crimean Conference has stopped the voices that were spreading rumours of dissensions among the Allies, the news of co-ordination of the military plans is welcome to all. That agree^ ment should have been reached on the vexed questions of the treatment ot Germany after victory is won, the organisation of international peace and security, the settlement of Europe in accordance with the principles o± the Atlantic Charter, and in particular the new governments of Poland and Yugoslavia, is regarded as a remarkable achievement. It was not to be expected that those who must always find some fault with Britain and ei Allies should accept all the decisions as just and honourable; these have argued that Germany is being handled too harshly, or that the representatives of Poland in London have been betrayed, or that Russia’s voice m European affairs is too dominant. In the East, the fall of Manila, the steady progress of the Fourteenth Army towards Mandalay, and the recent assaults from the air and sea on the islands of Japan confirm the feeling that victory in that quarter too is drawing rapidly nearer. The Fifth All-India Food Conference was held at Delhi from 29th January to 2nd February. To show the success of the “grow more food2 campaign it was stated that in 1943-44 the area under grain crops exceeded the average of the three years before the war by 11 million acres, with an additional yield of 4 miilion tons of foodgrains. The atmosphere of the Conference showed a marked increase of confidence and of co-operation between the several administrations. The decisions and recommendations of the Conference dealt, among other subjects, with “monopoly procurement” of grains by Provincial Governments (whether by acquiring grain offered for sale voluntarily or by compulsory levy) ; the extension of rationing, with a basic ration of one pound of cereals per diem for each adult; examination of diets, in order to improve nutrition; estimates of supply and demand in respect of such foods as f'ggs, poultry, fish, vegetables and milk, with a view to increased production; quicker and more even movement of foodgrains; the organisation of markets; increased production and use of manures; and improved supply of agricultural implements, machinery and material.’ Indians Overseas .—Feeling in India about the attitude of South Africa towards Indians resident there is still strong. This &gt;vas shown when in the budget session of the Central Legislative Assembly (which began on 8th February) a. motion was passed censuring the Government for not having yet carried out the recommendations made by the House in the November session for the recall of the Indian High Commissioner and the enforcement of economic sanctions against South Africa. Political .—The “Conciliation Committee”, mentioned in the last two Appreciations, is carrying on its enquiries; but politicians have been more interested in rumours of negotiations between the Congress and the Muslim League. Leaders of the two parties in the Central Assembly are said to have discussed in January plans for joining in a coalition Government at the Centre but there have been no developments, and Messrs. Gandhi and Jinnah have shown no encouragement of any such move. 33PSV—123—24-2-45—PSVPDV, CONFIDENTIAL ^ One copy of the appreciation of the political srtpation in India' No. 5 of 194^serie S) . which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions,' forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Governor- General (Public).

Tobacco, home-grown and imported, is to pay more duty; and charges on postal parcels, telephones and telegrams are to be somewhat increased. Two measures are designed to assist the restoration and expan sion of the machinery of production: in the assessment of Income-tax special initial depreciation allowances will be granted in respect of new buildings and new plant and machinery, and an allowance will be granted for expendi ture on scientific research. In his review of the year 1944-45 the Finance Member gave details^f Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid between India and the U.S.A. 1.he tcfeal amount of Lend-Lease supplies and services to India up to the end of 1944-45 is estimated at £386 million; the value of those which India, but for Lend- Lease, would have had to provide at her own expense is about £112 million; the total of Reciprocal Aid in the same period is about £93 million. During the year India has signed a direct Mutual Aid Agreement with the Govern ment of Canada, which entitles her to participate in the benefits of Mutual Aid accorded by Canada to the Allied Nations. India’s contribution to II.N.R.R.A. will be £6 million, to be paid partly in the current year and partly in 1945-46. The total of public loans since the beginning of the war to the end of January reached the impressive figure of £625 million. Though the problem of the inflationary gap may call for increased vigilance and control, the Finance Member claimed that the anti-inflationary measures that had been adopted and extended, aided by the very favourable turn in the war, had produced a considerable effect on the cost of living. In describing the part taken by the representatives of India at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held at Bretton Woods last July, he mentioned the refusal of the Conference to accept India’s proposal to provide through the machinery of the International Monetary Fund for partial multilateral clearing of war balances. The question therefore remains one for settle ment in direct negotiation with the United Kingdom. The Finance Member before his return to India had discussed India’s sterling balances with the Treasury; but it is not likely that any negotiations can begin till after the end of the war with Germany. The total holding on the 31st March 1945 will be about £1,030 million. His Majesty’s Government had agreed to »ct apart each year, specifically for India’s post-war development, a part of . ,a dollars accruing from India’s export surplus to the U.S. A., the amoun' is to be 20 million dollars for the calendar year 1944, and the same amount for 1945, in addition to what is needed for current requirements. The Finance Member described the great progress that has been made in the detailed planning for post-war development; but gave the warning that, so long as the financial and currency system of the country is over-strainedfor the maintenance of the war effort or in the transition from war to peace, heavy new expenditure would be dangerous in the extreme. “In other words, post-war development must mean, and must continue to mean, post-war development, and by no magic or optimism can it be made to mean war-time development”. He commended the Provinces which had made an early start and taxed themselves considerably in excess of their impiediate revenue requirements; and announced that he would introduce later in the session an Estate Duty Bill to assist their finances. ♦ In closing the last Budget speech of his six years of office, Sir Jeremy Ragman said: “I have been sustained throughout these troublous times by a firm belief that I was acting in the best interests of India ... I have had constantly in mind the thought of the fuller status that India may shortly be expected to achieve, and have endeavoured to order the matters entrusted to me m consonance with that expectation”. He was confident that India’s financial position is one of immense strength: besides the liquidation during the war years of her external debts and the replacement of them by massive assets, even her internal unproductive debt must be a far lighter charge on the national income at the new levels which she will obviously be able to maintain in the future. “This has been achieved at great sacrifice, but it has none-the-less prepared the stage for the momentous developments of the years to come”. The budget, as adding'no serious weight to the burden of taxation, has been received with relief; and there is general recognition of the great services which Sir Jeremy Raisman has rendered to India in these difficult years. This has not prevented the opposition groups in the Assembly from combining to demonstrate their voting power and irresponsibility by making n number of cuts in the grants and even rejecting the whole amounts under some heads. The Government have been defeated nine times in the divisions; and it may be expected that the Finance Bill will again be rejected. But the factitious collaboration of Congress and the Muslim League in the Central Assembly is not reflected in the country at large. For instance, the Muslim League Ministry in the North-West Frontier Province has just been defeated and replaced by a Congress Ministry. Though party politics in this Province are in some ways peculiar, the willingness of the Congress to take office, and on terms which imply wholehearted support for the wa#effort, is remarkable. It is stated to have the sanction of Mr. Gandhi; and it is the first symptom since the Congress Ministries, at the bidding of the high command, abandoned their tasks in November 1939 of any disposi tion to resume them. 21AGG—121—26-3-45—PSVPDCONFIDENTIAL One copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. 4 0 f 1943l)series, which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Governor- General (Public). &gt; New Delhi, the lajor T.

India and the War —The collapse of organised resistance in Germany seems imminent, and India regards the war in the west as virtually won. In the east the month has brought such encouragement as the capture of Fort Dufferin and further advance in Burma, the landing on Okinawa, Russia’s denunciation of the pact with Japan, the fall of the Koiso cabinet, and the naval victory of Kyushu. The death of President Roosevelt has moved the country deeply; he is mourned not only as one of the main artificers of victory but also as a leader whose wise and strenuous idealism will be sorely missed in the time when the foundations of peace have to be laid. Political .—The budget session of the Central Legislature has ended. As was forecast in the last Appreciation, the Finance Bill was defeated by the artificial conjunction of parties in the Assembly. This necessitated its certifi cation by the Governor-General; it was then again rejected in the Assembly and passed in the Council of State. The session was not barren either of interesting debate or of useful legislation; though the Government were defeated in a score of divisions in the Assembly, the tone of discussion was generally free from acrimony and the session even ended with what the leader of the opposition called “an honourable understanding”, in the acceptance of a grant which had earlier been rejected. Politicians are in fact not in an uncompromising mood. Many are expecting that some way will be found of loosening the deadlock. Most of the members of the Congress Working Committee are still in detention; on their record it could not be hoped that, if released, they would assist in a settlement; but in their absence there is a section of the party which would welcome an arrangement that would enable them to shgre in coalition governments at the Centre and in the Provinces wh ; Congress Ministries resigned in 1939. In spite of denials by leaders of the Muslim League, it is widely believed that the League would be a party to such an arrangement. Lord WavelTs departure for England four weeksago has given strong encouragement to speculation following these lines. But the difficulties of the political and communal situation are illustrated by the reception given to the proposals of the “Conciliation Committee”. This Committee^which has been mentioned in previous Appreciations, has recently published its resolutions. Of these Part I (which was cabled by ^he Committee to Lord Waved in London) recommended inter alia tlraL a “national government” should replace the present Executive Council at the Centre, and that in the Provinces the Congress Ministries should resume office, but with an admixture of members of the non-Congress parties. The Committee is handicapped by containing no Muslim of any note; and the suspicion with which the Muslim League greeted the details of this proposal was much increased when the remaining parts of the resolutions were later published. Part II deals with the constitution-making body and Part III with the principles of the new constitution. The Committee has emphatically rejected the division of India on “Pakistan” lines. It is proposed that in the constitution-making body the representation of Hindus (excluding “scheduled castes”) and Muslims should be equal; this is unacceptable to non-Congress Hindus; and Muslims are not appeased by the proposal, since the i epi esentation to be given to other interests would ensure their being outvoted. Muslims find further evidence of bias against them in the Committee’s proposal that similar parity in the Central Assembly should be conditional on their agreeing to joint electorates with reservation of seats being substituted for separate electorates. The Committee has proposed that no decision of the constitution-making body should be valid unless it is supported by three-quarters of the members present and voting, and that His Majesty s Government, while accepting decisions so made, should supplement them by its own awards where the requisite majority is not obtained This device might well result in placing on the British Government the main responsibility for framing the new constitution. The Committee’s miod intentions are recognised; but its findings cannot be regarded as furthering the cause of conciliation between the communities, or as improvins' on the terms of the “Cripps offer” of three years ago. 24AGG—124—24*4-46—PS V PDw [CONFU India an unconditiona] by all who hs pgrades have rSninded of of Allied an now to appea Rangoon, am Japanese citi pressed. ..

No. 5 of the 1945 Series, May 16th, 1945. India and the War. —The end of the war in the West, and the unconditional surrender of Germany, were greeted in India with enthusiasm by all who have co-operated in the war effort. V-Day celebrations and .grades have taken place in all parts of the country. Public opinion is rifninded of the extent of Indian, as of Allied, sacrifices, and the triumph of Allied arms has been hailed with widespread relief. Voices are heard now to appeal for a speeding-up of victory in the East: and the capture of Rangoon, and the increasing weight of American bombing attacks upon Japanese cities have confirmed the belief that Japan is already hard- pressed. The sudden death of President Roosevelt aroused genuine sorrow. Educated opinion regarded him as a good friend of India, and the loss that has resulted to the cause of world collaboration is widely realised. Nationalists shared this sense of loss since they believed he had a special sympathy for their views. The progress of the San Francisco Conference has attracted much attention. Public opinion generally welcomes the idea of world co-opera tion in the preservation of peace, but desires also to be sure that India will have a proper place in the counsels of the new world order. Those news- / papers which made a practice of alleging dissensions between the “Big Three” during the conduct of the war against Germany are now at pains to magnify any apparent differences between the great nations that have arisen with the coming of peace. Interest in such matters as the dispute over the presidency of the Conference and of the Steering Committee, the obstinate problem of Poland., the question of a seat for the Argentine, and M. Molotov’s references to the future self-government of India, and to the position of dependent countries in the post-war world was marked. . v,. The Government of India have issued a communique on post-war industrial policy. In the main the field will be left to private enterprise a 1 this will be given State assistance wherever necessary. Apart from railways, ordnance factories and public utilities which are na.tionalised already, other basic industries will be nationalised only if the public interest requires it and if private capital is not forthcoming. Provision is made for proper control of private enterprise by taxation and otherwise so as to ensure fair labour conditions and a reasonable distribution of wealth. Thequerulous are heard to contend that these plans, not having been fathered by “a National Government”, lack popular sanction; but opinion seems generally to approve them and to be anxious to speed the balanced develop ment of agriculture and industry so as to ensure prosperity in the years ahead. It is now more than five years since Congress Ministries demitted office in more than half of the Provinces of India; and in most of these direct rule has been necessary ever since. On April 20th, the House of Commons debated a further extension in five Provinces of such rule by one year: d Mr. Amery made it clear that the Governors of those Provinces wohid welcome the chance to form a Ministry, if a team, prepared to support the war effort and able to give reasonable assurances of stability and of support in the Legislature, should come forward. But at the moment there was no immediate sign of a desire in those Provinces to resume the burdens of office: and the motion to continue direct rule was agreed to. Speaking on April 22nd Lord Listowel, Under-Secretary of State for India, reiterated Britain’s solemn promise about self-government for India. •This aim does not “divide our nation into hostile camps. For this policy has been affirmed by one Government after another over a period of years”. Political .—There has been a lull in political discussions and in the utterances of political leaders. This must be regarded as due, in part at least, to the speculation aroused by Lord Wavell’s visit to London, and by the common belief that some changes in the political sky may follow that visit. The conclusions of the Sapru Committee (summarised in the last Appreciation) have not been generally popular. The Muslim attitude is frankly condemnatory, while the leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha regard them as having proceeded too far in the direction of appeasing Muslim claims. But Mr. Gandhi is pleased and satisfied with them; and Sikh opinion is favourable. The moderate leaders themselves are reputed to doubt whether the Committee’s recommendations can command widespread acceptance. Hr. Khan Sahib, the Congress Premier of the North-West Frontier Province, has corrected a misleading press report to the effect that he gave no assurance to support the war effort. 85PSV—124—28-6-45—P8VPD- - KU.

No. 9 of the 19£5 Series, September 18th, 1945. India welcomed the advent of peace in a sober mood. Although the 16th and 17th of August were observed as public holidays and there were vMicial celebrations, there were none of the scenes of spontaneous jubilation which have been reported from other countries. Prices of bullion fell and quotations dropped on the stock exchange. In part this tepid reaction may be ascribed to apprehension about the future of the war industries; m part it may be attributed to the general awareness of the far-reaching problems, both economic and political, which await solution in India. The fact that India was not represented at the signature of the Japanese surrender at Tokyo, while representatives of the Dominions participated in it, did not pass without adverse comment. A thorny problem which assumed prominence soon after the end of the war related to the Indians who fell into Japanese hands in the Far East and were formed into an “Indian National Army’’ which collaborated with the Japanese foices. Mr Jawaharlal Nehru was the first to give expression to public uneasiness about their fate; soon after, a Government Communique was published promising lenient treatment to the enrolled persons in the Indian Army who yielded to Japanese pressure, but contemplating action under the law tor their leaders. Public discussion on the subject is still proceeding. Among the recent statements on it is one by Mr. Jinnah, and the Congress Working Committee has passed a resolution urging that Indians who w 01 j ved io } the country’s freedom, however mistakenly, should not be penalised tor it.^ There is a certain amount of restiveness at the continuance of war-time controls, but it seems to be generally accepted that economic controls must be retained for the present in the public interest. Soon after the Japanese surrender, the Viceroy commuted the capita sentences passed against certain persons condemned after the disturbances of August 1942, and this act of clemency gave general satisfaction. The Simla Conference ended on a note of query. In the absence of any explicit statement on the subject, it remained a matter ^r f^ecture whether any further attempt would be made to set up a political p ov ^ n menfat the Centre in advance of the final constitutional settlement. Butthe sudden end of the war brought up the final constitutional settlement as an immediate issue. Mr. Jinnah had already said that the time for interim measures was past. On the other hand, Maulana Azad, the Congress President, issued a statement on the 20th August urging the need for an interim settlement as part of the final settlement. All doubts about the immediate measures in contemplation were removed by two announcements made on the 21st August, first, that elections would be held in the coming cold weather to both the Central and the Provincial Assemblies; a^d secondly, that Lord Waved was shortly paying a second visit to England to consult with His Majesty’s Government. On the 24th Lord Waved left. These announcements, indicating that the Indian question was under active consideration, had a tonic effect upon the political atmosphere. The decision to hold elections did not come as a surprise, but there is speculation about their exact significance, whether, for instance, the new Provincial Assemblies would be made the basis of a body to frame ^ the permanent Constitution of the country, as was contemplated in the Cripps proposals. It is expected that the announcement expected as a sequel to Lord Waved’s visit to England will throw light upon this aspect of the question. In view of the vital significance which public opinion attaches to the forthcoming elections, it is natural that political parties should be concerned about the accuracy of the electoral rods. The Congress leaders have complained that the voters’ registers were not correct and up-to-date, that many Congressmen were still in jail and some of their organisations illegal. An agitation is also under way for the adoption of adult suffrage. Apart from the suitability of adult suffrage in Indian conditions, this last is an impossible demand on practical grounds, because the administrative organisation of elections upon the basis of adult franchise would be difficult at the best of times, and in present circumstances will mean putting off the elections for upwards of two years thus upsetting the whole programme. Everything possible has been done to meet the views of the political parties in other respects; since time is inadequate for a complete revision of electoral rods even on the existing franchise, all the Provinces are endeavouring to bring the electoral registers as up-to-date as possible by the procedure of preparing lists of amendments; Congress bodies have been allowed to revive, and political detenus have been liberated. At one time it appeared likely that Congress might decide not to contest the elections, but the Working Committee of the Congress, which is now in Session at Poona, has decidedin favour of participation. The final decision will be taken by the All-India Committee which is due to meet at Bombay on the 21st September. The imminence of elections has brought about some changes of allegiance. Mr. Abdul Qaiyum, who has represented the North-West Frontier Province in the Central Assembly on the Congress ticket since 1937, and has been that Party’s Deputy Leader, has joined the Muslim League, and there have been other two or three defections from among the Congress Muslims. Sir Fi|p z Khan Noon, Defence Member of the Governor-General’s Executive Council, has resigned to free himself for taking part in party politics in the interest of the Muslim League. The League has declared that it will fight the elections on the issues, first, of Pakistan, and secondly, of its title to represent all Muslims. The Congress is apparently waiting to know the Government’s intentions before formulating its election “platform”. The Congress Working Committee has been confronted with the necessity for making clear its attitude on the question of Pakistan. In the statement of the 20th August, which has been referred to above, Maulana Azad had stated his own view that, while the Congress deprecated partition, it could not compel any dissenting unit to stay inside the free India of the future. The resolution finally passed by the Working Committee of the Congress is a restatement of the previous resolutions and it is doubtful whether it makes the position much clearer. Other resolutions passed by the Working Committee reaffirm the national and international objectives of the Congress as outlined in the resolution of August, 1942, and declare the policy of the Congress to be “negotiations and settlement if possible, non-co-operation and direct action if necessary”. One resolution warns foreign States that obligations entered into by the present Govern ment of India would not be regarded as necessarily binding on the free India of the future. Lord Waved returned to India on the 15th September and is expected to make an announcement in the course of the week. Waziristan is quiet, but shortage of foodgrains and cloth is causing some anxiety. The recent disturbances in the adjoining Afghan territory ha# apparently produced no repercussions on the British side of the border.. 55AGGr—125 -29-9- lA-PSVPDSoon after 19 th September Government’s reaffirmed the ( with the leader self-governmen would assume ] coming elect!or convene as soo: Constitution o: authorised to c whether the co: required modi! were also to b that a treaty si His Majesty’s the treaty was Government, steps to establi support of the statement, Lor but was deter: franchise won! made to revise night the Brit spirit of the C by Indian par Majesty’s Govi said that the ( incompatible ^ to make a unit fair by all par The new ; foreshadow an reason that, b public responsi based upon theConfidential. 1 No. 10 of the 1945 Series, October 18th, 1945. Soon after his return from the United Kingdom, Lord Wavell on the 19th September broadcast from New Delhi a statement oi the new British Government’s intentions on the Indian question. The announcement reaffirmed the Government's determination to do their utmost, in conjunct ion with the leaders of Indian opinion, to promote the early realisation of full self-government for India; and expressed the hone that political leaders would assume ministerial responsibility in all the Provinces alley the forth coming elections. It declared that His Majesty's Government intended to convene as soon as possible a constitution-making body to draft the future Constitution of India, but as a preliminary step the Viceroy had been authorised to consult the representatives of the Provincial Assemblies as to whether the concrete proposals for the purpose in the Cripps declaration required modification in any respect; and representatives of Indian States were also to be similarly consulted. It was part of the Cripns proposals that a treaty should be negotiated between the constitution-making body and His Majesty’s Government: the question of the matters to be included in the treaty was to be taken up for immediate consideration by the British Government. After the elections the Viceroy was also authorised to take steps to establish an Executive Council at the'Centre which would have the support of the main Indian parties. In a personal message annexed to the statement, Lord Wavell said that he was aware of the difficulties in the way, but was determined to overcome them. Any modification of the existing franchise would delay matters by at least two years, but efforts were being made to revise the electoral rolls efficiently. In a message broadcast the same night the British Prime Minister said the Government were acting in the spirit of the Cripps declaration of 1942, although it had not been accepted by Indian parties. Referring to the contemplated treaty between His Majesty’s Government and the constitution-making body, the Prime Minister said that the Government would not seek to provide in it for anything incompatible with the interests of India; and ended with an appeal to Indians to make a united effort to evolve a Constitution which would be accepted as fair by all parties and interests in India. The new announcement related to long-term matters and did not foreshadow any change in the immediate position; it was perhaps for this reason that, by contrast with Lord Wavell’s announcement of June, the public response to it lacked ardour. _ Nor, considering that if was inevitably based upon the Oripps proposals which no party had accepted, was it strange\ S ^ Bit. that the political parties were critical of it. The first public statement on the subiect was made by Mr. Jinnah who deferred his detailed comments till after further study, but emphasised that a satisfactory solution of the Indian problem could be found only on the basis of Pakistam Tins view was subsequently repeated by Nawabzada Liaquat Ah Khan, deputy leader of the Muslim League party in the Central Assembly. The subject came up before the All-India Committee of the Congress, when it met at Bombay on the 21st September, on a resolution proposed by the Working Committee which described the proposals as “vague, inadequate and unsatisfactory pointed out the omission of any reference to independence, nothing shor^ot which would be acceptable to the Congress and the country; criticised the proposal to make no immediate change in the Government at the Centre; set out a iong catalogue of grievances such as the sudden dissolution of certain of the Legislatures, and the failure to release all the political prisoners; but wound up by directing the Working Committee to take steps to contest the elections in order to demonstrate the will of the people, especially on the issue of the immediate transfer of power. This resolution was adopted with a small amendment. In the Government’s plan the details of the composition and procedure of the constitution-making body have been left open to modification in the effort to meet the point of view of the political parties, with the inevitable result that the future programme is somewhat delayed. Moderate opinion has fastened upon this aspect for criticism. In a long rhetorical statement, Mr. M. R. Jayakar, Sir Jagdish Prasad and Sir N. Gopalaswamy Ivengar have stronglv criticised what thev regard as tactics to delay a final solution. The Executive of the Scheduled Castes Federation has asked for representa tion in the reconstructed Central Executive, questioned the necessity for a specific body to draft the future Constitution, and objected m any case to leaving safeguards for the minorities to majority decision in the constitution- m a king body. Mr. M. N. Roy’s Radical Democratic Party has also been critical mainly on the ground that the future destiny of the country was being left to the decision of unrepresentative Legislatures. Although the resolution of the Congress Working Committee upon the crucial question of the self-determination of units was not submitted to the All-India Committee, the question was raised indirectly by amendments mj^ed to the resolution on elections. The movers of the amendments, which sought to confer the right of secession upon Muslim majority areas the majority of whose representatives in the Constituent Assembly desired it, were Muslim Congressmen of reputedly pro-Communist sympathies; the House was manifestly hostile to them and the amendments were voted down by laro-e majorities. ’ One of the members concerned has subsequently joined the Muslim League. In the course of the debate, Mr. Vallabhbhai Patelon ts be 5W er op on ^ee ? ? of bhe re; of cal 3ps ile, ion ore the Me ion ;nt, gar on. ita- r a ' to ion- &gt;een was the the ^ed bich the [ it, the own ined bitel and Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru made fighting speeches asserting that the Congress would make no more approaches to the Muslim League; it would contact the Muslim masses direct and would try to reassure them by appropriate means, perhaps through the Election Manifesto. Mr. Patel also suggested that the issue of Pakistan could be decided by arbitration. It is possible that this stiff and unyielding attitude should be ascribed in part to the requirements of the election campaign. The Muslim League, for its part, has been taking up an equally uncompromising stand upon the question of Pakistan; for instance, in the speech already referred to, Nawabzada Lmquat Ali Khan claimed for Pakistan the five Provinces of the Punjab, the North-West Frontier Province, Sind, Bengal and Assam, with their existing boundaries. On this point Mr. Nehru and other Congress leaders have said more than once that even if the right of secession from the Indian Union is agreed to, the portions of the Punjab and Bengal which have predominantly non-Muslim majorities would have to be given the option to choose on which side of the border they should remain; and this seems likely to be the official Congress view. The resolutions passed by the All-India Congress Committee were the official resolutions prepared for it by the Working Committee. The more important of these were mentioned in the last Appreciation; in addition the Committee also passed a resolution warning the British Government against any attempt to scale down the Indian sterling credits. The Working Committee has passed a resolution regarding the steps to be taken to utilise for peace-time purposes the skilled personnel, war hospitals, army camps and other resources; and has also appointed a Committee to organise the legal defence of the “Indian National Army' men. Both the main political parties have started their election campaign in earnest. Mr. Nehru has indicated that the Congress will fight the elections on the issue of “Quit India” or, in other words, the immediate transfer of power. The main election manifesto of the Congress will be prepared in time for the Provincial elections and will be endorsed by the All-India Committee, but in the meanwhile the Working Committee has been authorised to issue a manifesto for the Central Assembly elections. The Congress leaders are undertaking country-wide tours. Maulana Azad has been abk to patch up the factional feuds among the Punjab Congressmen. Mr. Gandhi is to visit Bengal in November and Madras the following month. The Nationalist Muslims are setting up independent machinery to fight the elections and are expected to act in co-operation with the Congress. A representative gathering of the Sikhs has decided that the Sikhs should fis'ht the elections independently. Sir Firoz Khan Noon’s efforts to bring about an accommodation between the Unionists of the Punjab and the Muslim League have not borne fruit. The Communist members of the Congress, whose position has been somewhat equivocal for some time, are to lesign. from the Congress party, and it is stated that they will support the Muslim League point of view in the elections. After the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee, there has been an outburst of communal disturbances in Bombay, but the situation appears now to have become easier An unfortunate aspect of the situation is that political parties do not always take sufficient care to restrain their language within the bounds of reason; there is an unmistakable tinge of violence in the atmosphere which may give room for uneasiness as the elections draw near. The nationalist movement in South-East Asia has attracted ^ much attention in India and several statements have been issued- by leaders-pf political parties criticising the use of Indian troops to put down the popular movement. The Indian Press is also devoting considerable space to the Palestine question with comments invariably pro-Arab in sentiment. The recent announcement regarding the appointment of Sir Chandulal Trivedi to be Governor of Orissa has been welcomed in the Indian Press as breaking new ground in a small way, but the comments generally take tne line that appointments of civil servants to such posts do not constitute any considerable departure in policy.

No. 11 of the 1945 Series, November 17th, 1945. In spite of their preoccupations with the election campaign, the political parties in India have given a good deal of attention to events m other Asiatic countries. The Muslim League, which has always laid great stress upon Arab rights in Palestine, sponsored a Palestine Day on the 26th October when protest resolutions against British and American policy were passed. There is evidence of considerable public uneasiness at the situation in Java and Indo-China, and in particular at the role of Indian troops in this area which, it is felt, is likely to imperil India's good relationship with neighbouring countries. Although the Congress has taken the lead in organising the campaign of protest, all the political parties have in fact vied with one another in expressing resentment at the official policy. The 29th October was observed as South-East Asia Day tinder the auspices of the Congress. On the 5th November the trial by court martial of three officers of the so-called Indian National Army opened in Delhi. The event attracted a great deal of attention on account of the energetic propaganda carried on by the Congress in favour of the persons on trial and the fact of Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru’s participation as one of the counsel for the defence. Demonstra tions in favour of the prisoners have been held in different parts of the country and have resulted in disturbances in some cases; at Madura m Madras the police opened fire while in Lucknow and Lahore the police were involved in trouble with demonstrating students. The Muslim League and the Unionist party have also expressed themselves in opposition to the trial. These events have provided occasion for violent speeches by Congress whn Vinvp mnrp than once referred to the possibility of a final stiuggle Mr Nehru; and, aithougn tne report was piomptiy feeiing persists that there is a deep-rooted and growing estrangement between2 the Congress and the Government. The general atmosphere remains one of tension and suspense. Elections to the Central Legislative Assembly begin this month, and although the results will be complete only by the end of the year, the general pattern of the result is already evident in part. The Congress has secured some 29 uncontested seats, and seems likely to bag most of the general constituencies. There is a tendency everywhere for the Hindu Mahasab^ and Independent Hindu candidates to retire from the field before the election. The Congress nominations reveal a tendency in some cases for Provincial leaders to migrate to the Centre; the greatest surprise is the omission of Mr. Bhulabhai Desai, the Congress leader in the defunct Assembly. His rejection is widely believed to be the result of the resentment of many of the “High Command 5 ’ at his part in the pact with Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan, the Muslim League leader. The Congress has put out an election manifesto couched in very general terms and based upon the 1942 resolution. Even pro-Congress quarters have criticised its failure to indicate more detailed policy. A more detailed manifesto is expected to be issued in December in time for the Provincial elections. Mr. Jinnah has defined Pakistan as including the existing Provinces of the Punjab, North-West Lrontier Province, Sind, Baluchistan, Bengal and Assam, and has declared that Pakistan will be a democratic State and will give full consideration to the interests of the minorities. This state ment has been criticised by Mr. Nehru who has pointed to the unsolved problem of non-Muslim minorities in the Pakistan areas. In the Punjab the Premier, Malik Khizar Hyat Khan, has stated that, while the Muslim members of the Unionist party subscribe fullv to the ideal of Pakistan, they join issue with the League on the question of the lines on which the Punjab should be administered. It is the view of the Unionists that in the conditions of the Province this can only be by a coalition between all the parties. In Sind quarrels about the selection’ of candidates for election have resulted in an open rupture between two factions of the local Muslim League (»e headed by the* Premier. Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, which has M.e blessings of the League headquarters, and the other led by Mr. G. M. Sved which has apparently greater local support. The Khaksars have fallen foul of the League because of the alleged lack of consideration with which Mr Jinnah treated their scheme for the future constitution of the country, and there have been some disturbances at election meetings organised by one or the other of the parties. Mr. Jinnah has advised his own followers to avoid attending meetings organised by opposed parties.In the course of Mr. Nehru’s tour of Rajputana, he held a meeting of the Working Committee of the States People’s Conference (of which he is the President) at Jaipur at which a resolution was passed demanding elected representation for the States peoples in the constitution-making body. Public comment about the recently announced policy in the matter of the future composition of the Indian army is inclined to be critical, mainly on 0£e ground of the expected delay in achieving complete Indianisation. The adherence of India to the United Nations Organisation without consulting the Legislature has likewise been adversely commented upon. The Soulbury Commission’s report and the subsequent declaration of the British Govern ment’s policy about Ceylon have drawn fire on two points—on account of the reserved powers proposed for the Governor, and on account of insufficient protection to minority interests. The rejection of the claims of the Anti- Fascist League in Burma in the formation of the Executive Council has been received with .disappointment. The Press has given prominence to a sugges tion by the Burmese leader, Mr. Aung San, for concerted action by all the Asiatic people against imperialist powers, and several Congress leaders have indicated support for it. The appointment of Mr. Burrows as Governor of Bengal has excited interest, and there is speculation whether it involves a fundamental change in policy and a simplification of the traditional pomp of a Governor’s life. Waziristan is quiet; the disaffected Afghans who were trying to stir up trouble for the Afghan Government have received no support from the tribes. The revolting Afghan tribes are now reported to have submitted to their Government. 244PSV—125—1-12-45—PS V P Umm ■ m,: t a ONFIDEN' The Cent Trie results re particular, th Muslim Leagi Congress has 1 Muslim Leagi who opposed t securities.

On the 10th Lord Waved took the opportunity of a public speech to counsel moderation and tolerance and to readirm his resolute intention to carry out the future political programme with all possible speed. Early m December there were prolonged conversa tions between Mr. Casey, the Jdengal Governor, and Mr. Gandhi who wasnn a visit to Bengal, and later Mr. Casey also met Mr. Nehru and other Cong^ps leaders. On the 10th the Viceroy also received Mr. Gandhi. To allay the * misgivings of other parties it was officially announced that the Viceroy was not undertaking any negotiations with the Congress, but only maintaining personal contacts, and this point of view was also expressed by Mr. Nehru. Nevertheless, public opinion attached some significance to these conversa tions, and upon their conclusion Press speculations viewed the outcome as something in the nature of a truce between the Government and the Congress pending the elections. An official announcement regarding trial of persons connected with the “Indian National Army' has also helped in easing the political atmosphere. This stated that the number of persons to be tried would be small, and that in any case, before the sentences of the Courts- martial are put into effect, the authorities would take into account the- conformity of the accused person’s actions with the recognised canons of civilised behaviour. Not perhaps unconnected with these developments was the passing by the Congress Working Committee of a resolution reaffirming the policy of non violence and making it clear that this did not authorise the destruction of property, the cutting of telegraph wires, the derailing of trains and intimidation. Some of the speeches delivered by Congress leaders in praise of the events of 1942 as well as their glorification of the “Indian National Army” had given rise to doubts on this point. Congress leaders have avoided commenting, directly upon the latest official statements, and the Working Committee, which met recently at Calcutta, has also not referred to it. But there is reason to think that statements of Government policy have not been entirely displeasing to themi; in particular, they seem to have appreciated the reaffirmation by the Govern ment of the urgency of early progress with constitutional plans. With regard to the warning about threats of force, Sardar Patel said at a public- ceremony in honour of the “Indian National Army” that they would give notice that a foreign power would not be allowed to stay on for ever, andthat they would now increase their demand to “Quit Asia”. Mr. Jinnah’s attitude has been more cordial, although he has said that. His Majesty’s Government still appear to be groping in the dark while the clear solution was to set up two separate States, giving freedom to both, he is evidently gratified at what he regards as a rebuff to the Congress. But his attitude towards the official programme for the future remains dubious, for he has ,said that the constitution-making body should be assembled only after the f nstion of Pakistan has been settled, and that there should then be two such dies, one for Hindustan, and the other for Pakistan. Press comments appear to regard the proposed Delegation from the British Parliament as a device to fill the time gap till the Indian elections are over, and criticism has been expressed about the tone of the statement in Parliament and the utility of the warning about threats of force. Apart from the resolution on non-violence, the Congress Working Committee has bee^i mainly busy with organisational matters. They have decided to depute Mr. Nehru to Burma and Malaya to assist Indians detained on charges of collaboration with the Japanese, and to hold a plenary session of the Congress in Delhi during the early part of April. As promised earlier, the Congress has issued an election manifesto intended more particularly for the Provincial elections. The chief feature of this document is the detailed enunciation of economic and social policy, envisaging State ownership of the key industries and transport and banking services, and radical measures in labour and tenancy matters. The manifesto contemplates for the future a Federation of India made up of willing units and an arrangement by which, in addition to a list of subjects which should, in the case of all the units, be controlled by the Federation, there should be a second list in respect of which they can federate if they choose. Another election manifesto which has been issued recently is by the Unionist party of the Punjab; this is remarkable for its total silence on the question of Pakistan. # 246 PS V—122—2-1-46—PS V PD// s** o CONFIDENTIAL.

No. 1 of the 1946 Series, January 19th, 1946. The last of the results of the General Elections to the Central Legisla tive Assembly, all from Bengal, which became available at the end of December, followed the general pattern elsewhere—overwhelming success 4 ' -' the Congress in the non-Muhammadan constituencies and for the Muslim League in constituencies specially reserved for Muslims. Here for the first time the Congress pitted itself against the League in two constituencies and was defeated heavily, both the Congress candidates forfeiting their deposits. Owing to the opposition of the Nationalist Muslims the elections have, generally speaking, been more keenly contested in the Muslim constituencies. The Congress has secured 91-3per cent, of the total votes cast in non- Muhammadan constituencies and the Muslim League 86-6 per cent, of the total votes cast in Muhammadan constituencies. The composition of the new Assembly will be Congress 57; Muslim League 30; Independents 5; Akali Sikhs 2; and Europeans 8; making up a total of 102 elected seats. In the last Assembly the distribution by parties was Congress 36; Muslim League 25; Nationalists 10; Independents 21; and Europeans 8. It is expected that the normal voting strength of the Congress will be about 60. In the last session of the Assembly the two main opposition parties had a tacit working arrangement by which they were able to defeat the Government in almost every important division. It remains to be seen whether the exacerbation of mutual relations in recent months will permit of the two parties working in unison in the new Assembly. The political parties are now concentrating on the Provincial elections. Although for purposes not directly connected with the elections, Mr. Gandhi has visited Bengal and Assam and is proceeding shoitly to Mhdias, Mr. Nehru has during the last month toured Bihar, Bengal and Assam and has just returned from a tour of Sind. In the course of these activities he ha.s found time to preside over a conference of States people which met in the R, put anti State of Mewar at the end of December at which the demands of the States people for elected representation in the Constitution-making body were formulated. Mr. Jinnah is starting on a three months tour of the United Provinces and the Punjab. In Sind, which has an overwhelming Muslim majority, there has at last been an open rupture between the League “Hmh Command” and the local League leader over the question of selection of candidates, and the local leader has decided to take his own line in regard2 to the elections. For this act of contumacy he has been expelled from the League. Muslim Leaguers are jubilant over their success in what they call ‘ the first round”, while pro-Congress opinion is reiterating the view that if the League’s electoral victory is repeated in the Provinces, and the demand for Pakistan is pressed, the consequence can only be the partition of the Punjab and Bengal, and the demand has also been voiced for a declaration from the British Government to this effect. Recent statements by Muslim League leaders reiterate the uncompromising demand for Pakistan; and there is evidence that on this subject opinion is hardening in the right-wing of fj ■ Congress as well. Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel, for instance, in a singularly aggressive speech said recently that the demand for Pakistan can only lead to civil war. The Parliamentary Delegation arrived in India on the 5th January and are, at the time of writing, in Bombay, having already covered the Punjab and the N.-W.F.P. In the beginning all the Indian parties displayed an ostentatious lack of interest in the Delegation; but once their status and purpose became clear, the attitude of suspicion has disappeared. The Indian parties seem to be quite aware of the advantages of presenting their point of view to a Mission of this nature, and, in spite of certain extremist counsels in the case of the Congress, seem disposed to follow the wise lead given by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and extend all co-operation to the Delega tion. The members of the Delegation have already met Mr. Jinnah, the Congress President and Mr. Nehru as well as other leaders of both the parties; and they have an appointment to meet Mr. Gandhi at Madras. The news papers are giving prominence to all available information concerning the Delegation and publishing special articles and comments intended to present their respective points of view to the visitors. The success of the Delegation’s visit has been facilitated by the general improvement in the political atmosphere in the course of the last month. One of the causes which contributed to this result was undoubtedly the action of the Commander-in-Chief in remitting the sentence of transportation for life passed on the prisoners in the “Indian National Army’ court-martial. The demand now is for dropping the other trials now in progress cg # in contemplation. Unverified reports in the Press to the effect that the Vic^oy has asked the War Office to send back Indian troops from South-East Asia have also helped to conciliate Indian opinion and to enhance the personal popularity of Lord Wavell. But the announcement of the Anglo-American loan agreement, with the possibility of reducing the Indian sterling balances, has caused much disquiet; which has been reinforced by the resignation of Sir Ardeshir Dalai from the Viceroy’s Executive Council which is taken as evidence of the incompatibility of official policies with anv really effective planning for the industrialisation of India. The report of Sir Tej BahadurSapru’s Conciliation Committee has been published, but as the Committee’s recommendations came out in April last, the report has not made much impression upon public opinion. The general feeling seems to be that it has fallen short of the realities of the situation. In the world of finance, the most striking event was the promulgation of the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance in pursuance of which bank notes of the denominational values of Rs. 500 and above ceased to be legal tender from the 12th January. The Ordinance provides for the exchange of the high denomination notes so long as a tender fcAexchange is accompanied by a declaration giving certain particulars calculated to help the Income-tax Department to pursue the tax-evader and black-marketer. This measure has been generally well received, though it has created panic in the minds of the black-marketers. S1A GO -125-1 -2-46 —PSA 7 ' P DCONFIDENTIAL.

[ C AN FID ENT IAL. ] APPRECIATION FOR THE DOMINIONS. No. 2 of the 194-6 Series, February 19th, 1946. Public interest is mainly centred on the progress of the general elections to the Provincial Legislatures. In the Section 93 Provinces of Madras, •Bombay, Bengal, the United Provinces, Bihar, the Central Provinces and ■Orissa, elections will not be held till March or April; but in Assam, Sind and North-West Province the elections have been completed, while in the Punjab they are expected to be finished by the 23rd of this month. The general tendency, already noticed in connection with the elections to the Central Legislative Assembly, for the Congress and the Muslim League to swamp the other smaller parties has continued. In Assam and Sind, the League has captured a large majority of the Muslim seats while the Congress has won all the general territorial seats. In the North-West Frontier Province, however, Congress has met with substantial success in the Muslim constitu encies and has been able to win a majority of them. In the Assam Legislative Assembly the Congress secured an absolute majority of 58 out of the 108 seats, and accordingly the leader of the Congress Party, Mr. Gopinath Bardoloi, was commissioned with the task of forming the new Ministry. This Ministry now consists of 5 Hindus, one Indian Christian and one Nationalist Muslim . Two seats were offered to the Muslim League on the condition that the League Party in the Assam Legislature would agree to work the Congress parliamentary programme. The League has rejected this offer in pursuance of its policy not to co-operate with any Ministry containing non-League Muslims. In Sind, the Legislature has never thrown up a stable majority party, and the results of the general elections have been true to form. The Muslim League captured 27 seats and one independent Muslim joined the League a&amp;ter the elections. The Nationalist Muslims secured 3 seats while : . G. M. Syed and his followers who broke away from the Muslim League on the eve of the elections were able to capture 4 seats. The Congress secured 21 seats. Of the remaining 4 seats three went to Europeans and one to an independent Labour candidate. After the elections had been completed a coalition party was formed under the leadership of Mr. Syed, 28 strong, comprising the Congress party as well as the Nationalist Muslims and the Muslim group under Mr. Syed. This resulted in the position of two parties with 28 members each, with 3 neutral Europeans and 1 independent Labour member (who has since decided to align himself with the coalition party).2 Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, the former Premier and leader of the Muslim League party, was commissioned to form the new Ministry which at present consists of 4 members, all Muslim Leaguers. Thereafter an interest ing situation developed. An offer of two Hindu seats was made by Sir Ghulam Hussain to the Congress party; that Party however insisted that it had become part of the coalition party under Mr. Syed with whom negotia tions should be conducted. . The Muslim League would of course not do this since its policy was not to coalesce with any Muslim group outside the League. The negotiations thus broke down. ^ j In the North-West Frontier Province the Congress has secured ai^ absolute majority of 30 seats including 19 Muslim seats. The Muslim League has won 17 seats, Nationalist Muslims (who generally co-operate with the Congress) 2 seats and Akali Sikhs 1. The Chamber of Princes held its session in New Delhi on the 17th January and its meetings were presided over by His Excellency the Viceroy. In his address to the Princes, the Viceroy assured them that no changes in their relationship with the Crown or the rights guaranteed to them by treaties and engagements would be initiated without their consent. At the same time, he expressed his confidence that the States would take their full part in the constitutional discussions which are to be held later in the year as well as in the intended constitution-making body. He further impressed upon them the necessity of placing their administration on modern lines and ensuring that all' States fulfilled the three fundamental criteria of good government, viz., political stability, adequate financial resources and effective association of the people with the administration. In the case of smaller States, His Excellency urged them to pool their resources and form political entities of a sufficient size either by joining larger units or by combination v with other smaller States. For its part the Chamber of Princes affirmed that the States fully share the general desire in the country for the immediate attainment by India of her political stature and their intention to make other possible contribution towards the settlement of the Indian constitutional problem; and on behalf of the Chamber of Princes the Chancellor declared that it was the policy of the Chamber of Princes that the fundamental prip#^- ples of sound administration should be followed in every State and that th should be popular institutions with elected majorities to ensure close a'y) effective association of the people with the governance of the States. These declarations have received widespread approval as indicating a general desire for improvement in the standards of administration of the States and for co-operative effort to march with British India. His Excellency the Viceroy addressed the Assembly on the 28th January in a 7-minute speech when he took the opportunity of emphasising the determination of His Majesty’s Government to establish a new ExecutiveCouncil formed from political leaders and to bring about a constitution making body or convention as soon as possible. The members of the British Parliamentary Delegation have completed their extensive, if rapid, tour of India and left for England on the 10th. They have had several meetings with the principal political leaders of British India, while some of them were also able to establish contacts with Indian states and their Rulers. Their earnestness and sincerity have impressed all alike, and the initial feeling of suspicion rapidly gave way to cordiality and I friendship. The members of the Delegation have not shown any tendency to belittle the complexity of the Indian political problem but they have made no secret of their anxiety that it must be solved urgently. There is little doubt that it is now generally recognised that His Majesty’s Government regard the question of a constitutional settlement of India as one which will not brook any delay. Sardar Vallabhai Patel is reported to have said, while at Karachi, that “the ship has reached the shore” and that the freedom of India is near at hand. On the other hand, Mr. Jinnah countered His Excellency the Viceroy’s Assembly speech with a state ment that the Muslim League was not prepared to consider anything short of an immediate recognition of the Pakistan demand and that the League would not be prepared to co-operate in any interim arrangements until this principle was made clear beyond all doubt and until it had been decided that there would be two constitution-making bodies, one for the Pakistan areas and the other for the rest of India. Mr. Jinnah subsequently elaborated this point of view in an interview to the Press in which he said that if the British carried out their intention of calling a single constitution-making body the only result would be a Muslim revolt throughout India. There has been further recrudescence of trouble in Bombay and Calcutta on account of clashes between the propagandists of Subhas Bose’s “Indian National Army” and the Police. On the 22nd January attempts were made to take out a big procession in the former city on what was called a “Subhas Kose Day” and a serious situation resulted from a clash between the processionists and the authorities. Firing had to be resorted to and caused a casualty list of over 20 killed during the two or three days of the trouble. Similarly, the conviction of one of the Indian National Army officers by a court-martial resulted in a demonstration in Calcutta on the 11th of February and subsequent days. This led to widespread looting, arson and other forms of disorder on a more serious scale. The death roll in this case has mounted to over 40. Mr. Jinnah is taking an active interest in regard to this parti cular officer who was defended under the auspices of a committee formed by the Muslim League.4 The deterioration in the food situation has caused grave anxiety over the whole country and has overshadowed all other issues. During the last 10 or 12 weeks there has been a total failure of crops in large areas in Madras owing to cyclone and drought; and in the southern districts of Bombay and Mysore as well as in certain parts of Western India on account of drought. There has also been a failure of rains in the United Provinces and the Punjab. It has been officially admitted that there is a possibility of a widespread famine in India unless adequate shipments of foodgrains are made available from out side. A strong Delegation composed of officials and non-officials has accord ingly been sent to London and Washington to press India’s case before the Combined Food Board. Within India also all possible measures are being taken to ensure equitable distribution of available food supplies. His Excellency the Viceroy toured the areas principally affected and had dis cussions with the Governors as well as consultation with Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Jinnah and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. The political parties in India have offered His Excellency their full co-operation in combating the threat of famine; though the Congress party declined to participate in the Delegation abovementioned. The indications are that the whole country is now facing the situation with realism and a spirit of earnest co-operation in all the steps that may be necessary to avert a serious crisis. 92AGG—125—2-3-46—PSVPDCONFIDENTIAL.

No. 4 of the 1946 Series, April 18th, 1946. The Mission of Cabinet Ministers arrived at New Delhi on the 24th March. Their welcome had already been assured by the British Prime Minister’s speech made in the House of Commons on the eve of their departure. The reference in this speech to independence had been particularly well received in India. The passage relating to the minorities not being permitted to hold up the progress of the majorities had, however, aroused misgivings in the minds of the members of the Muslim League, while being welcomed by the other parties: and when the Mission held Press Conferences, some of the questions put to the Ministers were concerned with this issue. The Ministers were however able to conciliate the questioners without committing themselves to any definite plan or procedure. At a Press Conference held on the 1st of April Sir Stafford Cripps made it clear that he would not be drawn into any technical discussion on the interpretation of past pledges, since they must be understood in the light of present realities. During the first week of their stay in India the Cabinet Mission was busy ascertaining the official views on the Indian situation by discussions with the Provincial Govei^iors and the Members of the Viceroy’s Executive Council. Then through formal interviews and informal contacts with the leaders of the main political parties and outstanding personages like Sir T. B. Sapru, they fully learned their respective points of view. When this phase of their activities was nearing completion they issued a statement declaring that their labours were now about to enter a very decisive phase in which the utmost efforts from everyone concerned would be essential for success, reaffirming faith in the possibility of a solution, and hoping that the Indian leaders would establish contacts and try to reach an agreement by the time they themselves returned from a short holiday which they proposed to take during Easter. An indication of the nature of the new intensive phase of the Mission’s activities was given by the interview they gave, for the second time, to Mr. Jinnah on the 16th April, and their similar discussion with Maul an a Azad the next dav. Speculations in the Press connect these interviews with practical suggestions which the Mission might themselves put forward and with efforts to bring the Congress and the Muslim League together. It should be mentioned that the Viceroy has been invariably associated with the activities of the Mission of which he is a member. The Sikhs, whose history has, almost from the beginning, been coloured by persecution by the Mughal emperors of Delhi, have always been one ofthe bitterest opponents of the Pakistan principle. When Sir Stafford Cripps came over to India in 1942, they unanimously raised the demand that there should be established a Sikh State in the Punjab, comprising the holy places of the community; and this demand has been renewed recently. Now Mr. Jinnah has expressed his willingness to concede such a State, provided it could be shown to him where it would be practicable to set it up. But the official demand for a Sikh State is still confined to the contingency that the setting up of Pakistan (to which they still profess strong objection) should become inevitable. The Sikhs comprise many big land-holders in the Punjab0 and are an important factor in the economic life of the Province, but in no district do they form a majority. To strengthen his hands, Mr. Jinnah called in Delhi at the end of the first week of April a Convention of over four hundred members of the various Legislatures in India elected recently upon the Muslim League ticket. Here a resolution demanding the establishment of a single State of Pakistan com prising the six Provinces on the North-West and North-East border, was passed, and all members took a pledge to brave all sufferings in the cause of Pakistan. The mover of the resolution stated that Pakistan was their latest demand, not necessarily their last, and the seconder (a former Member of the Viceroy s Council) spoke about calling in the aid of Russia if other means proved unavailing. Statements were also issued in large number by the Congress and other party leaders contesting Mr. Jinnaih's point of view and putting forward their own conclusions. Of these, the only one which requires mention is that made by the Congress President in which he commended the solution of the Congress based upon the independence of India, the unity of the country, the autonomy of the Provinces (subject to Central power) and the vesting of residuary functions in them and two lists of Central subjects, a compulsory minimum list to which all Provinces must accede, and an optional list the subjects in which can be accepted at the discretion of each Province. Although Mr. Jinnah has not yet commented on this statement, it does not' appear to have made any appeal to the Muslim League. By the end of March results were available of the general elections held to Provincial Legislative Assemblies of U.P., Bihar and Bombay and the first three days of April Ministries were set up in these Provinces in that order. The Prime Ministers in all cases were those who held office as such in the previous Congress Government, and the team of Ministers were also made up of the old members where available. The results of the elections as respects the main parties were in the United Provinces Assemblv (containing 228 members), Congress 152, and Muslim League 54; in Bihar (totalft strength 152), Congress 98, and Muslim League 34; in Bombay (total I75) r Congress 126 and Muslim League 31. The Hindu Mahasabha, the Radical Democratic Party and the Communists have been wiped out for all practical purposes and have only been able to obtain one or two seats in some Provinces. For the Bengal and Madras Assemblies for which results have come in later, they are as follows: — Bengal. Madras. Total ... 250 215 Congress ... 87 165 Muslim League ... 113 29 In Bengal Mr. Suhrawardy of the Muslim League has received a formal invitation to form a Ministry and he is conducting negotiations with the local Congress leaders with a view to the formation of a coalition. Similar attempts by the Congress in their majority Provinces have been unsuccessful. In Madras the formation of a Ministry has been held up owing to a dispute about leadership. To avoid any constitutional difficulty, Parliament has had to pass affirmative resolutions prescribed by the Constitution for the continua tion of Section 93 administration beyond the end of April. This is, how ever, conceived only as a safety measure, and the expectation is that an accept able leader will soon be forthcoming to form a Ministry. Results from two more Provinces, namely, Orissa and the Central Pro vinces are still coming in, but the dominance of the Congress in both the Legislative Assemblies is now assured, and was in fact never in doubt. In the dispute with the Union of South Africa about their new anti- Indian Legislation the Government have announced that they propose to bring the matter before the United Nations Organisation in an appropriate manner. This decision has been warmly welcomed by public opinion. India’s food position was reviewed at a conference with the representa tives of Provinces and States on the 17th April in connection with the formula tion of basic plans for distribution of availability to the deficit areas in India. It was found that with the local resources supplemented by the allocation of l-^r million tons of the Combined Food Board, if received in regulated quantities over a period of April to July, India would just be able to scrape through. If the allocation were reduced or a low priority given for the despatches to India, as there has been evidence of a desire to do in some quarters in the United States, nothing could save India from an extensive breakdown from the end of June involving famine of the worst character.One copy of the appreciation of the political situation in India No. of 1946 series, which has been prepared for communication to the Dominions, forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary to the Governor- General (Public). £:.£ .

At the end of June the Cabinet Delegation left India after a stay of more than three months. Although complete success did not attend their ^t'orts, the progress made was, in the conditions of the Indian pioblem, ~ Ratifying The task of the Cabinet Delegation in India had two aspects-— the long term one and the interim one. Of these the long term problem, which is fundamentally the more important and difficult, was the subject of the recommendations made in the Delegation’s statement of the 16th May these were accepted by the Muslim League and the Princes quite early, but the Congress at first withheld their decision on the ground that the complete picture, that is, including the proposals for the interim arrangements, was not available. The interim aspect of the picture was provided by the Delegation’s statement of the 16th June. During the ten days that followed the publication of the second state ment, the Cabinet Delegation and the Viceroy carried on intensive negotia tions’with the Congress and the Muslim League on the subject of an interim Government. The Sikhs rejected the interim proposals, as they had rejected the long-term plan, and refused to let their representative join the Executive Council. The Congress raised various objections to the Delegations proposals, but the most important of these was the question of including a Congress Muslim in the new Government. On the 18th June the Congress had virtually decided to record their protest in principle and accept the scheme suggested. But the next day a letter which Mr. Jinnah had written to the Vicerov demanding among other things that the communal composi tion of the proposed Council should not be altered without his consent, and that no Muslim who did not belong to the League should in any circumstances be included in the Government, received unauthorised publicity. Ine Congress now felt bound to insist, in the interests of ^ its clu n to be a non-communal organisation, that it should have unfettered right tern cm in ate to the Executive Council any person it liked from within its -allotted quota. On the 25th the Congress Working Committee passed a resolution rejecting the proposals for the formation of the interim Govern ment, but accepting the recommendations for the setting up of a Constituent Assembly in the Cabinet Delegation s statement of the 16th May. T is acceptance was not qualified by anv conditions, but the Congress reserved the right to proceed upon the basis of its own interpretation of the statement regarding, for instance, the grouping of Provinces.2 This created a new situation. In the statement of the 16th June relating- to the formation of the interim Government, there was a paragraph which declared that “in the event of the two maior parties or either of them proving unwilling to join in the setting up of a coalition Government on the above lines, it is.the intention of the Viceroy to proceed with the formation of an interim Government which will.be as representative as possible of those willing to accept the statement of May 16th”. The position now' was that since both the Congress and the Muslim League had agreed to accept the state ment of May 16th, an interim Government had to be formed with the particiG pation of both. But in view of the prolonged and wearisome negotiatior^ which had already taken place, it w r as decided that further negotiations should be undertaken after the elections to the Constituent Assembly had been completed, and that in the meanwhile the administration should be carried on by a stop-gap “caretaker Government” made up of officials. An announce ment to this effect was issued, on the 26th June, and the new' Government took office on the 4th of July. These developments w r ere very unpalatable to the Muslim League, which had expected to be called upon to furnish the predominant part of a new Executive Council, and bitter statements w r ere issued by the Muslim League leaders and representative organs. The view urged in one of Mr. Jinnah’s statements that there had been a breach of faith wdth the Muslim League was firmly controverted by the Viceroy in correspondence wdiich was also published. A very lively controversy thus started which has not yet died down. One of the objections of the Congress to the Cabinet Delegation’s proposals for the Constituent Assembly was the right which, quite undesignedly, the Europeans in Bengal and Assam Assemblies acquired to vote for the election of representatives. Early in July the European members of the Bengal Legislature declared their willingness not to participate in the election, and a similar decision was later taken by the European members from Assam. However satisfactory these decisions were to the Congress, they were displeasing to the Muslim League wdiich had from the beginning urged that the Europeans should retain and exercise their formal rights. On the 6th July the action taken by the Congress Working Commit^ was submitted for ratification to the All-India Committee at Bombay. this session Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru took over the Presidentship, to which M had been elected a couple of months back. Strong opposition to ratification was expressed by the Socialists, among whom the most prominent were the Congress workers wdio had organised campaigns of sabotage after the Congress leaders had been arrested in 1942. But the influence of Mr. Gandhi and the leaders of the Working Committee was able to carry the day and the official motion was adopted by 251 votes to 54. Mr. Nehru, both from the Chair and in subsequent public statements, declared that the Congress was3 &amp; committed to nothing more than participation in the Constituent Assembly, and that if this did not lead to the desired results, there was nothing to prevent them from resorting to other methods, including another struggle if necessary. These events appear to have perturbed the leaders of the Muslim League who have decided to call another session of the Muslim League Council (corresponding to the All-India Committee of the Congress), also at Bombay, towards the end of July to consider the new situation which has aJk|en. They consider that in view of what they call the Congress attempts tSupset the basis of the scheme for the future by claiming sovereign status for the Constituent Assembly, there should be a new official statement clarifying the conditions and procedure by which the Constituent Assembly must abide; otherwise they foreshadow the possibility of the Muslim League deciding not to'participate in the Constituent Assembly. Meanwhile both the parties are going ahead with preparations for the elections to the Constituent Assembly. The Congress has attempted to provide a broad basis for the Assembly by nominating some eminent fton- Congressmen of letters and professions as well as representatives of the Anglo-Indians, Indian Christians, members of the tribal population, and women. The first election, in Sind, is already over and has resulted in the ^return of a Congress Hindu and three Muslim Leaguers of whom two are Ministers. From. Assam have been returned three Muslim Leaguers and seven Congress candidates. From the Frontier Province one Muslim Leaguer and two Congressmen (including Maulana Azad who has just demitted office as Congress President) are likely to be returned. In the Punjab the Sikh Communal Organisation called the “Panthic Board” decided not to parti cipate in elections to the Constituent Assembly, but subsequently Sikh candidates filed nominations at the instance of the Congress President. Following further consultations these nominations were withdrawn later. All, the election results are expected to be available before the end of July. The uncertainties of the future Constitutional position have had their , effect in the Indian States also in several of which popular agitation has led to disturbances. An agitation in Kashmir involved Mr. Nehru in a collision wEJf the State authorities, who refused him entry into the State, and this led to his detention for a couple of days. Mr. Jinnah is at present on a visit to Hyderabad where he is apparently‘trying to consolidate the Muslim interests. The passive resistance campaign in South Africa is watched in India with great interest and sympathy, and the decision of the Government to refer the dispute to the United Nations Organisation has given general satisfaction. The Government have prohibited exports to South Africa and the import of roods to India from that country. The difficulties of the Indian workers in Ceylon are very much before the public eye; the Congress Working Committeehas recommended that the strike of the estate labourers should be called off, and has also appointed a Committee to consider the position of Indians in Ceylon in all its aspects. Evidence of labour unrest is provided by the strike of postmen now in progress, and by strikes in several textile and other factories. A Commission appointed by the Government to consider the question of revising the pay and other conditions of service of Government employees has commenced its sittings. Thanks to the better prospects of imports from the United States and the East Indies, the food situation showed some improvement, but severe flo^ in parts of Bengal and Assam may bring about some deterioration. An unofficial mission from the United States which recentlv visited India to study the food problem at first hand has testified to the efficiency with which the food control policies are being worked by the various Governments in Jndia. 114AGG—122—]-8-46 —PS V PD</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000104_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/309</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000104</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/309</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/12 Indian Situation Reports (Appreciation for the Dominions)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1946</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-05T21:10:03</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (130 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in rough chronological order.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 145; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
