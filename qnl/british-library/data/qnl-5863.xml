De Gaury , M.C., Political Ag^at, Kuwait; The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, iiushirefr Visit of H.M.King ^bdul Aziz of baud! Arabia to Kuwa_it^_ With reference to my telegram No.48-A, dated the 7th February 19 36, I have the honour to submit the following report on the visit here of the King of Gaudi *irabia# His Majesty King Abdul Aziz after a show of proper reluctance to impose himself on Kuwait, was persuaded by the Shaikh, who went out to see him to enter Kuwait territory as his guest, on the 30th January. r^Q Political Agent (Colonel H.R.P.Dickson) went out some little way to meet his party as it came in. This is courtesy in accordance wilfc local ideas, which for some obscure reasons or superstition avoids meeting or seeing off visitors at Town gates. ^ The subject of any private political discussions which may have taken place between the Shaikh and the King are still undivulged. No offidnl conversations took place. The King’s visit was generally said to be due to a desire to be near at hand to Ghaikh Yusuf Yassin, who is engaged in conversations in Baghdad in connection with the Pact of Non Aggression (Turkey-Persia 7 Iraq-Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan) and possibly in addition on a side agreement between Iraq and Baudi Arabia only; also to return the visit which was owing to the Bhalkh of Kuwait who visited Riyadh in 1932. 6./2 « Hurrying couriers passed frequently between Kuwait and Baghdad throu^iout the King’s visit, while on the other hand His Majesty and his entourage produced an atmosphere of cordiality and unexpected brightness in Kuwait. 7. His Majesty seemed particularly vsell although he alleged a severe attack of some internal trouble while travelling. He was in a quite romping and very lavish mood. 8. His presents included an order for several new Ford cars from Basra for the bhaikh• Hs. 1500 to the poor of Kuwait and a very handscme sum to Jassim al Yacoub, the Jhaikh* s Palace ^vgent and the shaikh's servants. 9 . In return every man of the party which numbered six hundred and seventy five (who travelled in 145 motors ) was given his '’KIBvVa” , i.e. cloak and complete outfit and thirty rupees. 10* iimong the royal party were the imir Muhammad, son Kmir Khalid, son Kmir Mansour, son Kmir Baud al Arafa, brother-in-law Dr. Fakhri , Bhaikh ai ^rdh Abdur Rahman ash Bhuwaish , Chamberlain Ibrahim al Jumaia, secretary. H. His Majesty ’ s romping mood showed itself in much jocularity at the various parties he attended and included the throwing into the sea of two IKH^AH Mollas, who were later suitably rewarded for being victims of this royal horseplay. l 2. His Majesty is credited with having married twice luring his week’s stay, first to MJ&amp;SA, a daughter of the Late Bhaikh Mubarak of Kuwait and secondly - information is Less certain here - to the daughter offered by an Uafisi, the king’s agent in Kuwait, a girl whose youth and beauty is said to amply make up for any lack of lineage. 13 His Majesty accepted invitations fromThe Political agency (Colonel Dickson}, Shaikh id.! al Khalifa (cousin of Shaikh}, Shai:di iihdulla al Jabir (son in law of shaikh), Abdulla an Nafisi (saudi -urab i^gent), Mulla oalih (Shaikh’s Secretary), Hilal al Mutairi (the rich pearl merchant, whose presents included many jewelled and gilded arms) but it i s understood, refused, at the shaikh’s suggestion, two invitations from Sabah an Nasir, Grandson of shaikh Mubarak. by Colonel Dickson, Chief Local Representative of the Kuwait Oil Company, visited His Majesty, with whom was the Shaikh, on 6th February, and subsequently accompanied the party as it left some little way on the road- in ord^r to hunt with him on and about the frontier. His Majesty expected to reach Jarya al Ilya on about the 9th February, and the shaikh to return to Kuwait about the same day. excellent. The town was en fete and the shopkeepers found it a financial windfall very much to their liking, because this Wahhabi party bought up every bottle of scent in the bazaar, much silk, 40 gramophones, every record available, tobacco in great quantity, many maunds of coffee, all Ford and this may not have been the least of his objects in view.

Sir I have the honour to say, in continuation of my letter No.0-49 of 7th February 1936 and telegram on the same subject, Shaikh this morning (11.2.36) I gave him the opportunity to say what private political discussions, if any, took place between himself and King Abdul Aziz, during the latter’s visit. me. Colonel Qiokson of the Kuwait Oil Co. Ltd.* tells me that he went further than I did am asked the Bhaikh point blank what he and the King discussed. The Shaikh - so Colonel Dickson says - emphatical- ly denied any political conversations. I think we may take it that they did discuss politics because, as you are aware, no Arabs of position are capable of being together long and not doing so, but it may be,and probably is,true that it was not the immedia* object of the King’s visit and that my conversations were general and incidental. 2. It is now publicly known that the ohaikh spent i^s. 100,000 on the entertainment of and gifts to his visitors. He says that it was well worth it as relations are improved. 1 that in the course of a conversation with the He did not take the opportunity I gave to tell 3 A sidelight on this was the King’s publicpubli c denouncement to some Iraqi visitors of Iraqi journalistic methods and general inclination to fish in troubled waters* In Nejdi style he paused in hi 3 d enounoement to ask for confirmation of the truth of his points as he made them, and the bashfulness of the Iraqis was increased by the resultant chorus of 'True 01 King' from his cronies and followers* The Shaikh described the scene with scrae am us ement • 4 0 But ap(rkt from such political arabesUes relations would seem to be really improved as a result of the visit. 5 # His Excellency received a final telegram of thanks from the King dated from Riyadh on the 9th.

I did this because while wishing not to figure prominently in the visit, I did not wish to be thrust too far into the background and this I felt as the visit progressed was actually happening. 2« tfith the help of the Embassy, Baghdad, I was able to get some news reels, documentary and ordinary films for the Shaikh to show to H. l.H. The propaganda effect of this, both in the general direction of Anglo-Arab relations and as connected with war sympathies, was excellent. Not only did H.B.H express his appreciation but I have just received a letter from him conveying further thanks. I have written thanking the Chancery, Baghdad, and also Squadron-Leader lewis, who kindly arranged for the ftlaa to be flown from Shaibah.
