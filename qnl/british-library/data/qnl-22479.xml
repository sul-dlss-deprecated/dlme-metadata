Petroleum Concessions, Limited, have, however, been operating in Qatar without the formal bringing into effect of this article. The British subjects contem plated in 1916 were British Indians the responsibility for whose protection was then a problem for the Shaikh. Conditions are greatly different today and the Shaikh would probably welcome the opening of a bank. It seems preferable, therefore, to approach him direct on this point, without raising the general question of the bringing into effect of Article VII of the Treaty, over which he may prove difficult. I should be grateful for your comments on the above suggestion and for your views as to the mode of approach to the Shaikh which is likely to offer the least difficulty. 2 .

Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to F. A. K. Harrison, Esquire, India Office, London. it is most desirable that it should be a reputable one and from this point of view the Imperial Bank of Iran's decision is regrettable. The Bahrain Manager of the Eastern Bank came to see me recently and after pointing out that the Imperial Bank of Iran had got in first at Kuwait, Dubai and Muscat enquired whether there was any possibility of his Bank's being given a chance in Qatar. He informed me that from his headquarters on the subject and I therefore suggested that he should consult his headquarters and that if they wished to pursue the proposal he should approach the Political Agent, Bahrain. You might perhaps consider it worth-while enquiring from the head office of the Eastern Bank in London whether they are interested in Muscat and I will also let their Manager here know that the Imperial Bank of Iran have abandoned their option at that place. 5 If a Bank is to be established at all at Muscat the idea was entirely his own and that he had no instructions Copied.

I talked to the Shaikh, his son Hamad* and saleh al tfana*, about this when I was in Qatar.

I assured them that as long as the Shaikh did his best to provide reliable guards, we would not hold him automatically responsible for thefts or damage done to the bank's interests or personnel; he would be responsible in the same degree as he is for the personnel and property of the Oil Company. This seemed to satisfy them, and I think it is now safe enough to put the proposal in writing and that Abdulla bin Qasim will give us the reply which we wish for.

Grant will be sending you a copy of the letter he*writes to the Sheikh confirming the points of agreement reached. 2. Briefly, in the presence of Grant, Smith, Salih, Abdullah Darwish and myself, the Sheikh gave the Bank a free hand to choose a permanent site, for which he would then dis cuss terms. He also gave them a free- hand in the selection of temporary premises, and to their inviting tenders for work on.such premises and on their permanent building, from local contractors, he was unwilling to have contractors brought in from outside. At ax second interview with the same people plus the Jarwish interpreter present, agreement was reached m prin ciple to a twenty-year lease at a ground rent of 1200 rupees per annum, of a site on the ouay to the West of the Customs nouse and immediately adjoining it. The immovable property would revert to the oheilch on the expiry of the lease, with an option for the Bank to renew their tenancy £&lt;br a subsequent ten-year period at a rent to be fixed at the' time. 2. respite our emphasis on the importance in normal commercial practice of the system of competitive tenders, Grant tells me that when he w;ent to take his leave, the Shekh made it clear that whatever he might have said previously, he in fact expested the contract to re given to his '’brothers' the Jarwisni We are familiar with the system of the Oriental potentate and his favourite, but for the' fiuler himself to tout for business for his favourites in this way must be something new, even innthis part of the world. 6[u J.A.F.

You have referred to our conversation of Wednesday, the 24th of August, 1949, with regard to your interest to open a branch for The Eastern Bank in Qatar. We have informed you verbally that we have no objection for the opening of a branch by The Eastern Bank Ltd. if it is going to be for the benefit of the Country, the people and the Bank from the economic point of view, and we understand that you do not demand other concessions, which is mostly preferred. We really do not find a suitable building that could be rented and is fit for a branch of The Eastern Bank. We have informed you verbally about that. When you decide to open a branch, we will discuss the question of a suitable place with you. As regards Staff, it is as we have discussed it with you during the a'oovementioned meeting. We repeat what we have said verbally, that there is no objection to the Eastern Bank for the opening of a branch, if the object for opening the branch is merely economic and in the routine of other economic transactions.

August about the Manager of the Doha branch of the Eastern Bank. 2.Smith.the Manager, was drunk on the night of 2,8tli. August in the Bank's building which is his office abd his residence. At about 9.DO p.m.he went to the sentry at the door of the building and asked him to fetch him a woman. The sentry refused more than once and Smith thereupon left the building,and walked unsteadily and noisily up the road. The sentry passed word of all this to the Commandant of Police who at once set cut to find Smith. Smith had returned to his house with a small crowd of locals shouting at him. The Commandant told Smith to remain in his house and go to bed, and this Smith agreed to do. However,a very snort time later the same thing happened again and this time the Commandant stayed with Smith until he began to go to sleep. D.It would not be fair if I did not explain the conditions in which'Smith has had to live. When he first came at the beginning of this year he lived with the Darvish. In order to be independent lie moved into his present building before he had any electricity.cooked for himself,and led an altogether difficult and solitary life. Cochrane tells me that his wife was quite certain that Smith was not feeding well enougk and tried to Help him. All this added together ,and the absence of his wife in particular.turned Smith,who has a liking for liouor,into a silent but nervy drinker. He does not strik me as 'a fit man,and for what it is worth I repeat to you that he complains of the mood and says it has some effect on him. 4.Smith is personally liked by ail who come in contact with him.including uhe local population. He has never been anything but cooperative with me. However, he has been warned in the past by*Wilton, by his Manager, and his last warning from the Adviser was that the next time must be the end of his stay in Qatar. I have no hesitation in saying that I think it impossible to allow Smith to remain here: the British community is small and such things as this reflect on everyone, where they might not in a larger place;we have only recently r arrived in this part of the Persian Gulf,and must set a very higK standard; and also the Ruler is more fanatical in his religion than some,and he has already been told the story by the Adviser. 5.My recommendation is therefore that Smith should leave Qatar as soon as possible. If you agree, I think it w r ould only be neccessary to tell the Eastern Bank that Smith is 'persona non grata.' in t'atar,his manager will know the reason why. I do not intend to call for a police report unless you instruct me to do so. K. icC.Andrew Esc. HBoM.Political Agent, Balirain - £ c ht° X $ if-O * «/*».' * 7 _- -■ .

I think you will agree that It wfcs unfortunate in that whereas such an incident might have no undue repercussions in other posts, the present circumstances in Doha made it imperative even from a political point of view that such action should be taken.
