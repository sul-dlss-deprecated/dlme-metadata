This includes the drafting of a directive for Wing Commander P A McWhannel, the Air Adviser attached to the UK High Commission to Pakistan at Karachi, outlining the responsibilities he is to assume over the aforementioned personnel. The file also contains an application from McWhannel for an aircraft to be made available to facilitate regular visits to Kabul: see folios 12-15.Another significant topic covered by the file is a request from the Government of Pakistan for a copy of a plan for the expansion of the Afghan Air Force; the Air Ministry had prepared a plan for the expansion of the Afghan Air Force at the request of the Afghan Government. A copy of an abridged version of this plan is included in the file: see folios 52-66.A report by Wing Commander A R L Griffiths on his visit to Afghanistan (24-28 May 1948) has also been filed: see folios 88-93. This reports on the Afghan Air Force and the role of RAF personnel. It also tackles the question of supplying an aircraft for the use of the Air Adviser at Karachi.The main correspondents are: HM Minister/Ambassador at Kabul (Giles Frederick Squire), the UK High Commissioner to Pakistan (Sir Laurence Barton Grafftey-Smith), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Commonwealth Relations Office, and officials of the Foreign Office.On the inside front cover can be found a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>UK High Commissioner to Pakistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Afghan Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Adviser, Karachi</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kabul</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Personnel</topic></subject><subject><topic>Visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000236#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
