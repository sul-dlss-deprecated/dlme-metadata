It is not clear whether proposal is that twelve ex-service men should be civilian employees of Company or should be enlisted as members of His Majesty's Forces. The latter suggestion cannot be considered as it involves serious, difficulties, in particular those of divided control and of use of British Forces at expense of a foreign company for protection of private property. If civilian personnel are required the Air Ministry cannot undertake to act as a recruting agent for company but is willing to assist with advice. The best solution would seem to be that Company should itself recruit the men through its London representative for protection of the Company's property exclusively and should accept full control and facts of responsibility. If necessary a clause could be included in the contract of service between Company and men that they would be required by the Company to become members of local defence force and to take instructions on training and defence methods from Gulf Defence Officer and his Tj on-Commissioned Officer instructor. It is assumed in above that new proposals are in addition to and not a substitute for recommended plan and do not affect in any way the position of infantry company contemplated in paragraph 14 of plan.

Numerous schemes for defending the Bahrein Oil Field and Refinery have been on ^paper or in practice since the beginning of 1939. No satisfactory practical scheme has so far been developed. The commonest causes of failure in the various plans have been 1. Division of control 2. Poor and insufficient personnel 3. Expense. It is understood that Major Byard is now responsible for the whole defense of Bahrein and it is necessary to formulate a scheme which will give him complete control of all personnel en gaged on defense. In the plan at present in force the Company hires a num ber of English guards who are supposed to take their orders from Major Byard. Major Byard has no disciplinary control over these men and the Company^ power is limited to either a reprimand or discharge. Time and again it has been found that the guards, realising the weakness of the authorities’ position, do more or less as they like. The Company has already stated its decision not to replace guards who leave: nor to employ new guards under the existing conditions. The Company believes that as matters are now it is a waste of time and money to bring guards out here. It is agreed on all sides that if guards are to be efficient they must be enlisted men subject to the discipline of one of the armed forces Acts. The Company is willing to keep the six guards who are here now until better arrangements can be made. If permission is obtained to use enlisted men as guards the Company is willing to do the following things !• To release the present guards from their contracts. The Company would like these men to be offered an opportunity of enlisting in the new body of guards. If these men do so enlist the Company will give them an undertaking to send them to their homes at the end of the war. If they do not wish to enlist they will be sent home as soon as the enlisted men arrive. 2. To pay the salaries of 10 enlisted guards, provided the maximum salary the Company is asked to pay is L 25 per month per man.- 2 - The Company will not accept a state of affairs in which some of the guards are enlisted men and some not, except during a short transition period: nor will it pay for more than ten guards, whatever their condition, except for a short time while a change over is taking place. 3. The company will supply board and lodging for the enlisted men on the same scale as it supplies its ba^chelor em ployees. Or, if desired, the Company will pay an allow ance in lieu of board and lodging. But all the guards must be on the same basis - either all on rations and housing or all on an allowance. 4. The Company will, if necessary, pay the cost of trans porting 10 men to Bahrein at the commencement of their service as guards and will pay their way back to their homes at the end of the war. If a man is invalided home before the end of the war the Company will pay his passage. If a man is posted to another location the Company’s liability for passage ceases. 5. The company will supply free medical and hospital treat ment on Bahrein provided that the need for such attention does not arise from alcoholic indulgence, brawling, venereal disease, wilful misconduct or criminal acts. The Company accepts no liability for ill-health or injury that a guard may acquire. 6. The Company will make no arrangements for leave, pension, gratuity or other benefits. 7. If the authorities find that they can obtain 10 suitable men as guards at salaries less than 2b 25 per month per man, the Company will nevertheless continue to pay up to £ 25 each month for each man provided the difference be tween the actual salaries and the amount paid by the Com pany is used to pay extra white guards that the author ities may wish to employ. If extra guards are employed and payed in this way the Company will extend its offer of board and lodging, or an allowance in lieu, to 4 such guards. The whole of the above offer is subject to these conditions:- 1. The defense Plan must be approved by Air H.Q. Iraq. 2. The native personnel employed on defense must be supplied in sufficient numbers to ensure that the whole defense plan is workable. 3. If a curtailment of the plan comes into effect, either on the instructions of Air H.Q. or because native police can not be maintained in sufficient numbers or for any other reasons, the Company’s payments for defense will be reduced proportionately.This opportunity is taken of outlining other obligations that the Company has accepted or will accept to further the ex ternal defense of its property, 1, It will supply quarters for the Commanding Officer and the Iraqi officer, and barasti huts for the native police. 2, It will maintain the searchlights and supply power for them, 3, It will supply and maintain a searcher for Class II employees. 4* It will maintain telephones in the -^ield and supply one operator on each night shift. 5. It will supply and maintain four motor vehicles for the use * of guards and police, and will supply drivers for them. 6. If the police acquire Ford vehicles extra to the above the Company will maintain these, up tto the number of two, in good running order, and will supply drivers for them. The Company will not supply major replacements for these vehicles, e.g. engines. If the defence force needs more than the four vehicles offered by the Company and can obtain them in no other way, the Political Agent should apply in writing to the Company for extra vehicles. The request will be referred to the Directors of the Company for decision. J It must be emphasized that the above is not the full extent of the Company’s contribution to defense. The Company has spent many thousands of pounds on the material defense of the wells and the refinery; it maintains these defenses; it supplies all the internal defense at Zeliaq, wali, Tank Batteries, Refinery, Sitra Tanks, Sitra Pier and the Loading Line and Pier. Its current expenditure on defense is I around lilSOO each month. '/ Approved By for M. H. LIPP, General Manager, THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LTD.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. confidential* Department.

These men were to be engaged by the Bahrain Government but to be paid for by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited who have agreed to / this. The Government of India have now intimated that the Government of Bengal have agreed to provide one European Inspector and two European Sergeants immediately and the rest will follow in due course. They wish draft terras to be prepared at once and forwarded to them, the terms to include the following s— (a) 1 a.y in rovincial scale plus 25 % Foreign Service pay (b) Free transport bothways Cc) Free massing and housing (e) Leave and pension contributions. Government of India also ask whether in case they offered any married men accommodation can be found for them and if not would the Bahrain Government pay them (d) Uniform allowance separation allowance ? 2/-2. it,h rogard to (a) above, it is the regular practice of the Government of India to lend its servants on foreign service on condition that they receive their ordinary pay plus 25 % foreign service pay. The extra 25 % is of course intended to compensate the man for having to live outside his regular province and indeed in this case living outside India altogether. As regards (b), 'ovarnment servants lent on foreign service are always given free transport bothways by the authority which engages them. Daily allowance should also be paid to them at the same rate as is paid by the Govern- rrumL g* India for the equivalent class of Government servants# As regards (d), it is the regular practice in the Indian Police for the personnel to receive an allowance for the upkeep of uniform. As regards (e), these also are items which are regularly paid by the borrowing authority; they are calculated on principles laid down in the Gover ment of India accounts rules# In case married accommodation cannot be provided the Government of India have asked whether separation allowance would be paid. The amount payable on account of separation allowance is not specified but would no doubt be intimated by the Government of India on receipt of your agreement to pay. 3. As the matter is urgent I would be grateful if you would kindly let me know whether these terms are agreed to and if so send me a specimen draft of the terms of service.

I discussed the matter with Lipp who told me that the company agreed to pay the same sum as they pre viously paid to the European police for the services of the British Police Officers and N.C.Os from India© The company employed 7 men, six of whom were paid £25. per month and one who was paid £28. per month. In addition the company will provide free quarters and messing but no accomodation for families. 2. I should like as soon as possible to know the basic pay of the Indian Police Officer and N.C.Os because at present I do not know whether the sum which the company agree to pay will cover the pay and allow ances etc. of the men from India. The Bahrain govern ment is spending a large sum on protection and if the sonnel perhaps the number could be reduced. 3. The*Bahrain government agrees to the terms 4.

Sir, In reply t o your letter No. C/323-28/1-L, dated 10-4-41 I beg to state that I regret to note that my request has not been considered in a favourable manner* As regards the length of engagement of service at Bahrain, may I point out that no mention v/as made in the terms as to how long we were to remain out here. The Bahrain Government should have stated the duration for which they required us. Further no agreement whatsoever was drawn up* to this effect. r Another point to be considered is our salary as we find that there is a difference in the scale of pay, and had it been pointed out to us prior to our departure from India that the Calcutta Police had already been sent on deputation to Bahrain and knowing what their salary was, we would not have accepted the35r terms, i.e., 25^ on our Provincial pay* In fairness to us the Bahrain Government should have notified this fac to our local Government. Due to this we are experiencing difficulties: The nature of work and responsibilities are similar, but there exists a discrepency in pay; hence we infer that we are inferior to the Calcutta Police Sergeants who have undergone the same training and have passed similar tests.The salary of the Calcutta Police Sergeant i: of a higher scale of pay due to the expensiveness of the City (Calcutti We are at present residents of the same station, which is really ex pensive, and the question of expense also arises with us. If we are to be replaced either by a Bombay City or Calcutta policeman, the Bahrain will have to see their way to pay them according to their salaries, which is far above ours, i.e., Pay of a Bombay City Police Sergeant is Ks 210/- with annual increments of Rs 5/- rising to Rs 250/- while the Calcutta Police Sergeant commences on a salary of Rs 200/- 5 -250, the increments being biannual. I trust. Sir, that this fact will be taken into consideratiob, v/hich I can assure you will be greatly appreciated by one and all concerned. The question of marriage is now to be considered. The presentiac 'rip 6 Gontd. lyfll ctor of the Defence police is a married man, with the full consent d laiowledge of the Commissioner of Police of Calcutta. According to iur letter which is in reply to our request, you clearly stated that . ciielo rs on iy were called for. Since this is the case why was the Inspect gen t who is a married man, when there were other volunteers who were helors? I ha^re been given to understand that he has applied for a Lparation allowance, and if this is granted to him then my case also Itands to be considered as I intend getting married very shortly. I am Ltitled to get married on the expiry of 3 years service, which terminates the end of this month and this will entitle me to married quarters free f charge. Since as you state married quarters are not available I request hat an allowance be granted in lieu. If the Bahrain Government was not pre- ared either to grant married quarters or an allowance in lieu, it should avp-b een 30 stated in the terms. May I point out that the terms offeree othe Bombay Distric t Police did not stipulate that only bachelors were Squired. Furthermore may I point out that my pay is such that I would not e able to maintain two establishments in the event of my getting married. At present we are being put to great inconvenience as regards our uarters. No provision has b een made for the coming hot season and no iriiracy is attached to the housing, i.e., the bathroom which is common to 11 is about 25 yards from my room, and at the time of having a bath we ar&lt; xposed to the servants, who have access to the building at all hours.

I submitted a oetition through the Defence Officer stating certain ooints which affected the Bombay District Police, who are now on depu tation to Bahrain with regard to our salary and housing conditions. This has been regarded by the Defence Officer as insubordination. I have a copy of the petition which was forwarded to you and I fail to see where I have committed myself in that respect. May I point out once again that the Calcutta Police Force and the Bombay District Police Force are on two different scales of pay and serving the same Government in the same capacity as Sergeants. Had any other Police Force been represented on this island in place of the Calcutta Police: eg.| Madras Behar and Orissa etc. who are on the same scale of pay as ourselves, there would have been no cause for such a petition. It is only fair that the Bahrain Government should have notified this fact to us prior to our departure from India. In an interview with the Defence Officer, w r hich was at his request he clearly stated that he did not aoprove of the idea of my submitting r f the petition, which was addressed to you and which he regarded as being insubordinate and that I was at liberty to return to India if so de sired and that no obstacle would be put in my way to orevent my going, hence this petition which I trust will be considered. I am,Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sergeant, Defence Police. 'Defence Police. &amp; ■fiwali. 15th April. 1941. TO;- The Political Agent, Bahrain. Thro: The Befence Officer, Persian Gulf, at Bahrain. Si-Ff I have 'the honour to state that in answer to your letter jo; C/323/28/1- L. Dtd. 10/4/41. that:- (a) In the terms nothing was mentioned, about tarried men, or bachelors , and anart from this my I.G. of Police was fully aware of my intentions of getting married, as permission was obtained from him to get married in January 1941. Further there was no mention of married quarters not being obtainable in Bahrain. As far as it is understood , I have come here on deoutation as a volunteer , but am still to abide by the rules and regulations of which I enlisted 5 under in the Bombay District Police . Therefore I am entitled to get married after comoletion of three^ years service , also free married quarters, or , rent in lieu. As the fact in question was not kbioulated in the terms, it is to be assumed that this rule still in existence , I therefore would like to satate that if ths stipulation had been mentioned in the terms , can it be oleased explained as to how the present Defence Inspector was sent on deputation to Bhhrain when he has come under the same terms as we have come under, wh en volunteers who were bachelors , were refused . Had this fact been stated in the terms , I would not have come to Bahrain .It is honed that this question will be taken into further consideration , as I was due to get married 'ithin a few days of my departure for Bahrain , due to my departs from India ,1 had to postpone my marriage . (h) Again the terms were rather ambiguous ,in thisreoect , the allowances given to us , were considered to be Provincial allow ances which helped to make up the pay. As the terms st&amp;bed that We were receive 25% of our 'Provincial oay , it was taken for granted that, we would receive as stated 25% of our pay , but °n arrival here we are informed that it is only 25% of our actual D ay, which has changed the financial outlook considerably.-2- cont. (3 considerably . This question was only a request made to you under undermentioned circumstances . The Calcutta Police are given a larger scale of nay due to the exoencivness of the locality in which they serve in , not because they are in any way superior to the Bombay District Police , and now that we are all serving under the same Government , same responsibilities , and have the sane expenses as the Calcutta Police , we hope that you will see it befitted to bring us on the same scale of pay , as that , of the Calcutta Police . The few rupees we have gained does not counter act the expendveness of Bahrain # Due to the above mentioned facts it would be very much appreciated , if this would kindly be taken into consideration once again . (c) Is respectfully noted for future guidance. Awali. Dated. 15.4.41.

I explained that (a) there were no married quarters to be had and that the Bahrain Government had made it clear that they required bachelors, (b) that the Bahrain Government was paying them according to the terms laid down by the Government of India, viz., pay in provincial scale plus 25% and that any difference between the pay in different provinces was not the concern of the Bahrain Government; (c) I said that on volunteering, they must have known that it was a war job and likely to last for the duration. The actual terms were 2 years or the duration. 4 . I told them that in my opinion their alleged grievances were frivolous and that from their applica tor H. T. Hewitt, K.C., tions as.... Defence Officer, Bahrain.2 \ &amp; ii ^ as well as from other sources it appeared that they were acting in a contumacious manner likely to upset the minds of the other British employees in the vicinity, that in time of war I could not allow such behaviour on the Island and that if it did not stop at once I would have to deport one or both of them 5« I shall be glad to hear how these two men behave.

Memorandum Reference your memorandum dated the 29th May 1941 regarding the agreements of the Police Sergeants. 2. The answers to the queries raised are as follows : Paragraphs 1 and 4 These sergeants were provided by the Bengal and to Bombay Governments and they belong therefore/the Bengal and Bombay Police. Calcutta Police and Bombay District Police are really subordinate services of the Bengal and Bombay Police. Further, the pay, conditions of service etc., are laid down in the agreements and it is quite immaterial whether they are said to belong to the Bengal Police or the Calcutta Police. I therefore consider that it is not necessary to alter the agreement in this respect. I might mention that these agreements were prei. pared by the Government of India. Paragraph 2 Your interpretation is correct. • Paragraph 3 . This is purely a financial arrangement as regards leave and pension contributions to be made to the Govern ments of Bengal and Bombay by the Bahrain Government. Paragraph 5 . The Bahrain Government have been under the mistaken impression /-2 &amp; impression that the Compensatory Allowance of Rs. 25/- per month which was shown in the Last Pay Certificates of these sergeants as drawn by them in Bombay^was also due to them in Bahrain. This is not so and. it should not be included in the agreement,. 3.

The original establishment of British Police Personnel to pe attached to Bahrain Soecial Defence Police for Anti-Cabotage Measures, was 1 uoerintendent and 6 Sergeants. tt no tune has this establishment been above 1 Suoer- intendent ana 5 Sergeants. Since Sentember last the strength has been down to 1 Superintendent and 4 Sergeants.” According to the Bahrain Defence Scheme a sergeant should be on duty at the Pefinery for 24 hours. This would, if carried out, entail the employment of 2 sergeants le? ving only one to carry out the eaually necessary work of suoervising, especially at night, anti-sabotage guards in the oil fields. This was brought to the notice of The Chief Local Eeoresentative last July when establishment started to drop owing to the departure to India of Two E.C.Os. I atrach a copy of my DEF/B.PTS/21 dated 16th July, 1941. At the time it appeared to be understood that the arrangements laid clean therein vere suitable; hence my reason for my not pressing for extra Police from India. Mr. M.F. Lipp, the Chief Lochl Representative, has now approached me with a view to the* E4.hour European Guard being reinstituted. &lt;. This cannot be done until the full establishment is received. In the circumst nces, therefore, I would reouest that The Government of India be asked to provide two Aurooean sergeants to complete establishment: this is more urgent now in view of the approaching hot weather ana conseouent risk of casualties. In this connection I would urge that only Sergeants of pure European parentage be sent, anu that they also be bachelors as no accommodation is available lor married .C.9s, nor will they recrive any marriage allowance.-^^B5Se» WBa w«BI CO^Y -' Tomt defence Officer, Persian Gulf, a,brain.

No. 3iy - • sr of 1361 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, Safar 14, 1361 March 3, 1942. H. B. M f s Political Agent Bahrain. Memorandum:- With reference to your memorandum No. C/196 dated 11th February 1942, regarding the enlist- ment of another Indian Police Sergeant. The present arrangement is that these ser geants are employed by the Bahrain government on behalf of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The Bahrain government receives from the Bahrain Petro leum Company £25. per month for each sergeant and £28 per month for the Inspector. This amount is intended to cover the cost of these N.C.Os. likely to cost the Bahrain government considerably more than the amount which is paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. In 1941 the position was as follows:- Received from the Bahrain Petroleum Company Rs. 20,683. Expended by the Brn. Govt.- The total cost of these British N.C.Os is Pay and Allowances Rs. 17,310 Passages Clothing Miscellaneous 2,262 623 19 20,214 Surplus 469 o a *2 On the other hand against this apparent excess of Rs. 469/- the Bahrain government is liable to pay to the Government of India leave and pension contri butions which amount to about Rs. 5,000/- for the years - 1941 and 1942 and an additional Rs. 550/- for three sergeants who returned to India. The Bahrain government is alos liable according to Indian Travel ling Allowance regulations, to pay additional passages on first appointment and on completion of contract. The outstanding claims of these officials for passages will amount to about Rs. 7,000/- roughly calculated as under:- 5 N.C.O.'s at present serving, each claiming Rs. 900/- apprx: for 3 passages to Bahrain on 1st appointment. Rs. 4,500/- 3 Sergeants already pevent-ed to India (Bombay) each due 6 passages to and from Bahrain apprx: @ Rs.265/- per each passage. 4,770/- 9,270/- Less already paid 2,260/- Net liability approx 7,010/- The following are the estimated Receipts and Expenditure for 1942:- a. (i) Anticipated Receipts from Bapco for 12 months, for the present staff (1 Ins pector and 4 sergeants) £ 128/- per month £1,536 p.a. (ii) For one additional sergt say for 9 months @ £25/- 225 ' 1,761/- £1,761./- converted @ Rs.13/8 per £ will be Rs.23,773/5 b. Anticipated Expenditure (i) Present strength for 12 months @ Rs. 1,450/- p.m. 17,400/- (ii) Additional sergt for 9 months 1,800/- (iii) 3 passages for above 900/- (iv) Outstanding claims (see above) 12,550/- Total estimated expenditure Rs.32,650/-WMUGQ Thus the Bahrain Government will have to meet &lt;*- deficit of Rs. 8,400/- taking into consideration the surplus of Rs, 469/- on the account of the year 1941. It may he observed that no provision has been made in the above estimates for passages for any of the N.C.O f s who may be granted leave during the year. According to their Agreement (clause 7) they are entitled to travelling allowance for journeys on leave to India and back during the period of foreign service. If such an eventuality arises the Bahrain Government will have to pay for 2 passages each way to and from Karachi in accordance with Government of India Travelling Allowance Regulations. The chief reasons for expenditure above the amount received from the Bahrain Petroleum Company are:- 1. A grant of separation allowance at Rs.120/- per month to Inspector Kiddle. 4 2. Payment to Government of India Pension and Leave contributions on behalf ^&gt;f these officials. 3. Payment for additional passages in accordance with Travelling Allowance Regulations appli cable to them. These payments were not anticipated by the Bahrain Government. It is fully realised that these British N.C.O f s are employed on defence measures in Bahrain. They replaced a group of men who were employed by Bahrain Petroleum Company on defence work in the oil fields until they were found to be unsatisfactory and were discharged. The Indian Police sergeants were then taken on but as it was not possible for the Government of India to lend Police to a commercial Company the Bahrain Government assumed the position of employer and the Bahrain Petroleum Company agreed to pay the-4- salaries of the Indian Police N.G.O's. It is now evident that the Bahrain Petroleum Company contribu tion will not cover the to£al liabilities incurred by the Bahrain Government. The Bahrain Government is maintaining a special Police force of 150 men with N.C.O's and officers, in addition to the State Police and Naturs, whose duty is to protect the Refinery and Oil fields also a number of extra watchmen are employed on special duties at Government expense. It would,I think ,be reasonable for the Bahrain Petroleum Company to reimburse to the Government the actual expenses incurred over the British N.C.O's. The Bahrain Government could submit a statement of expenditure each month which would include such items as passages, pension contributions etc. I should be grateful for your views on the matter.

Please refer to your memorandum No.317-SF dated 3rd March 1942 in regard to payment of the British police personnel employed at Awali. 2. During 1941 receipts from the Bahrain Petroleum Company covered payments made by the Bahrain Government and left a small balance in hand. I suggest that a statement of accounts be prepared at the end of 1942, and that the position be then re-examined. If the sum paid out by the Bahrain Government proves to be substantially less than the amount received from the Company, I will represent your case to them. The Company would, I am sure, be more willing to make payment of a definite amount at a later date than they would be to accept responsibility now for liabilities the extent of which cannot be accurately determined. Political w snt, BahrainReference P.A.'s note above. ^• 1 he only statement of the Company's intentions in regard to the payment of the Police Officers recruited from •‘■ndia appears to be in Mr .Belgrave* s to Major Alban at p. 85. In that letter it is stated that f, the Company agreed to pay the same sum as they previously paid to the European police”. i'his Mr.Belgrave apparently took to mean that the Company would pay £28 for the Inspector and £25 for each Sergeant, and no more, vide para 1 of his D. v . referred to above as well as the estimates of receipts from Bapco in p.u.c. The terms offered to the British N.O.s originally recruited by the Company however included 'pass ages, any leave granted, and insurance premiumsvide para 1 of the Company's letter at p.l. But when the Guards originally recruited were found unsatisfactory and the Company decided not to recruit any more Guards or to replace those who resigned under the existing conditions they put forward a new scheme of payment outlined in the memorandum enclosed with their letter at p.44, in which they agreed to pay up to £25 for each Guard and stated they would make no arrangements for leave, pension, gratuity or other bene fits (para 6 on p.46) but would pay passages of the men to and from their homes ^para 4 ibid). In this connection please see also para 3 of the Company's letter at p.44. 3. From the Bahrain Government's point of view, the fact remains that they accepted the Company's terms as they seem to have understood them, though the Government of Ird ia stipulated, in their telegram at p. 78, that the terms should include free transport, uniform allowance and leave and pen sion contributions. These terms were communicated to the Bahrain Government in memorandum at p.79 and accepted in para 3 of Mr.Belgrave's B.C. at p. 85. 4. It should however be stated that the Government of India's original stip ulation regarding transport was 'Free transport both ways” (p.78) though later, arising out of an application by Sergeant 'ithers, forwarded under Adviser's / memo-2- memo No.870-SF dated 22nd May 1941 at p. 168 the Government of India ruled that the Sergean should he paid travelling allowance admissible to them under Government of India rules (vide Government of India memorandum at p. 238). 5. Further, though in their acceptance of the Government of India s terms the Bahrain Government did not contemplate paying any sep aration allowances and suggested that if pos sible married men should not be enlisted they subsequently paid a separation allowance of Rs 120/- p.m. to Inspector Kiddle vide their memo at p.172.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000039_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/664</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000039</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/664</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 28/1 L I BAPCO refinery guards’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-26T21:05:07</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (295 folios)</extent><extent>The volume’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.
