(ii) article 14 (a) . Che words 'existing roads' are substituted for 'present and future roads'. (iii) Article 26 .

Adopting the precedent of Umm-al-Quwain, I send you three copies of these documents which do not contain any feature of interest. You may observe that the payment on signature under Article 5(a) of the Concession is Rs. 60,000 only. This tactfully conceals an additional payment of Rs. 90,000 which was made separately and in the form of a personal present to the Shaikh at his special request and for fairly obvious reasons of State.

Dear Peel, Many thanks for your letter P.Z.3231/39 of the 18th July about the exploration permits granted by the Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah and Ajman to Petroleum Concessions Limited. 2. We concur in your proposal to communicate the approval of His Majesty’s Government in respect of both agreements to the Company and to the respective Sheikhs. 3. We also agree that you might at the same time inform the Company, without repeating all the 1935 conditions, that any subsequent agreement for the grant of a mining concession will be subject to the approval of His Majesty s Government and further that it will be understood that the Company will be guided by the advice of the political Resident in carrying out their explorations under the agreements. I am sending a copy of this letter to Jarrett and Starling. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H.M. EYRES. R.T.

The latest paper relating to the Ras al Khaimah permit was the enclosure to India Office letter of the 14th January, No. P.Z.217/39, and the latest regarding Ajman, the enclosure to India Office letter of the 12th June, No* P.Z.3231/39. You will have seen that the Political Resident sees no objection to the Ras al Khaimah agreement and that bethinks it unnecessary further to pursue the only point (i.e. that relating to jurisdiction, arising out of article 8(a)) which he had been disposed to raise in connexion with the Ajman agreement. We agree with his views. 2. In considering the Ras al Khaimah permit we here had C.G.Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty, thought/thought it unnecessary for His Majesty r s Government to signify their approval of it. The document specifically ^^provicles that a iresh agreement (which of course would require His Majesty’s Government’s approval) will he required for the grant of a mining concession. And as Petroleum Concessions Limited are by now well established on the Trucial Coast and fully acquainted with our requirements in the matter of procedure there seemed no need to reaffirm the conditions which, at a time v/hen new ground was being broken 5 were attached to the approval of the Has al Khaimah option in 1935 ( vide the enclosed extract copy of India / Office letter to Mr. Skliros, No. P.Z.8856/35, dated the 12th December, 1935, copies of which were circulated at the time to the Departments concerned). Since however the Company (in their letter of 14th April) assume that approval for the Ajman permit is required, we would propose, with the concurrence of the other Departments concerned, to communicate the approval of His Majesty’s Government in respect of both agreements to the Company and to the respective Sheikhs. Without repeating all the 1935 conditions we might inform the Company at the same time that any subsequent agreement for the grant of a mining concession will of course be subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government/T 3 Government on such conditions as His Majesty’s Government may determine s and further that it will he understood that the Company will he guided hy the advice of the Political Resident in carrying out their explorations under the agreements. Mill you please let me know if you agree? 3* I am writing similarly to Eyres and Starling. Yours sincerely (SgdJ B- Confidential. ill].

On the balance of advantages it seems to me a good move on Longrigg*s part to have secured the Exploration Pemit frcm the ohu^/rb of Has al Khaimah* As you will see the period of the Permit can be extended t o 3£ years, which is a long period, and in the meantime the Standard Oil Company of California or any other Oil interests are automatically kept out of Ras al Khaimah territory. This helps in the matter of His Majesty* s government* s ultimatum, vide paragraph 2 of my letter No. c/429 of 6th July 1938. ~ 3. you a^ e a^aie, normally an oil concession is divided into three stages - Exploration, Prospecting and finally lining. This was, for instance, the original form in which the Bahrain Concession was given to the Bahrain Petroleum Company - vide Colonial Office letter No.79/35/30 of the 8th February 1930 to the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited. in later concessions, however, on the Arab side all three stages have been telescoped into one concession. 4. The present Exploration Permit of Petroleum Concessions limited a t Has al Khaimah is in affect the first of the above R.T.Peel Esquire, MC., The India Office, Lond on. stages /stages and from another aspect is really a continuation of the P.C.L. Has al Khaimah Option which expired on the 1st August 1937. An important difference, however, is that the further activities of the Company after the Permit expires are subject to the ’’consent of both parties* (see paragraph 5(2) of Long- rigg^ letter of December 8th. Lorgrigg has not numbered his paragraphs,'business men” never do, but I have done it for him.) In the normal concession the concessionaire has an option to proceed to the second stage and then to the third provided he exercises this option within the period which is laid down. 5. With regard to Longrigg’s opinion on the subject of the decision to allow Petroleum Concessions Limited to negotiate direct with the Beni Kitab for a visit to Jebel Faiyah, commented on in paragraph 2 of Weightman’s letter under reference. It is possible that Longrigg may be correct but in order to give the Company any possible chance of getting to Jebel Faiyah this decision had to be made - see correspondence ending with India Office telegram &gt;To.l826 of 18th October 1938. * I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and We ightman. i * -* sent under Printed Letter Uo.779-3 of 23th December, 1938.GOVERNMENT 0^ tndta e~ a j 9^7 1 1959 j Confidential EXPRESS LETTER [2V, Tj % 7 his is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated, on r&lt; ceipt, with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed.

Mr. Long- rigg has stated that the decision to allow Petroleum Cone as 3 ions Limited to negotiate direct with the Beni Kitsb tor a visit to Jebel Fsiyah, thus side-tracking the presumptive but impotent suzerain, the Shaikh of Sharjah, has led to some misgiving on the part of some of those Trucial Coast shaikhs who have not/ -wanted con cessions to the Company lest any of their own inland tribes should similarly renounce allegiance. How far this is correct and how far this particular point la responsible for the &gt;haikh of Ttes al Khaimah * &amp; refusal to conclude negotiations Cor a concession I am not at this stage able to say; though my own suspicion is th?t the Shaikh has j merely sought an excuse to avoid what is to him the repulsive | prospect of having to make up his mind finally. Che permit now obtained appears to secure for Petroleum Concessions Limited a position of considerable immediate acivanta e, though they may have cause to regret it if their exploration produces encouraging results and they decide in due course to negotiate for a full concession* 3. Though I was under the impression that It had been accepted unofficially that options, or anything in the nature of an option, were not to be sou -ht, I do not see that any objection need be taken to the present Penult. yet Sd/- H. Weightman Political A^ent, Bahrain.p ■' ~y HAS AL XHAIMAH TRUCIAL COAST. December 8th,1938 An Exploration Permit, for 2 years extendable to 3V, and containing the prospect of a future Concession (if the Company should so desire) based on the f, consent of both parties' was signed here last night. The Arabic original and an English translation are attached hereto. The Shaikh retains one Arabic original. Copies in both languages are being passed to the Political Agent, Bahrain. 3. It wax explained in my letter of Dec. 7th that the Shaikh was not prepared to sign a Concession at the present time, even if the Company offered very much more than at pre vious discussions. It did not appear that any persuasions by the Company^ representatives could alter this decision, unless berhaps by the offer of payment on a scale not pre viously contemplated; The choice there seemed to lie between leaving our position in this territory still unite indeterminate and offering the Euler an Option, or Exploration Permit, type of Agreement. After some conversations with him and his advisers, a draft exploration permit was submitted to the Shaikh, con taining (1) no initial payment, (2) moderate monthly payments, (3) full drilling righ s, (4) promise of a concession later 'on terns similar to those granted by other rulers of Oman', on demand by the Company in the event of oil being discovered, (5) considerably greater initial payments than had been con templated before, in that event only. The Shaikh, however, axxlixxxat declined to allow any drilling until after a con cession had been signed, and did not wish tob ind himself at present as to subsequent concession terms.

The Permit signed and herewith forwarded contains, €8 will be seen, the following principal matters (1) .Exclusive rights of search and exploration (but not 2f, years, extendable for a further one yearl 12 ) A subsequent agreement is to be made (prior to drilling) covering drilling, exploitation, etc. at any time the Company may apply for it after exploration work. Ihis shall be made 'with the consent of both parties'. (3) The Company may surrender the present permit at any time after the first year - i.e. it is not committed to any payment except the first. (4) The annual payment for the first 2^ years is at the rate of n.s. 30,000 (£2250) per year, and for the extension year at the rate of Rs. 45000 (£3300) per year. There is an additional payment of ts. 10000 -750) on original signature and I promised a nresent of one Ford van. (5)/The Coiapany may not enter 'dangerous areas'. (It will ) probably be found in practice that these areas if any i areas improperly *xkx claimed by the Shaikh^ as his; and, since they are not named, thev could ; probably be entered, if required, under other than his auspices — with the ple« that we never consi ered 7 them to belong to him nor to be covered by the Agreement). Tuch are the chief provisions. As against a concession on the lines hitherto discussed, it represents an immediate saving of some hs. 150,000 (initial payment) while postponing a Concession settlement, if the Com pany (after 4 field-seasons further work) still wishes to proceed to this. It is probable that the time will come within the next years when the Shaikh will be better dis posed to a Concession than he is at present, and the Company can take advaifege of any such opportunity without having lost anything. Cn the other hand it may well anpear during the period that, so weak is the inland hold of the coastal rulers, the Company would after all be better advised to do its business wit.h the irihnd tribal chiefs (whose first step will doubtless be repudiate all Has al Kh&amp;imah control) direct. 3d/- Stephen H.

The Shaikh originally granted to the D'Arcy Exploration Company, who transferred it to P.C.L., a 2 years' option which expired on the 1st August, 1937. We have since been endeavouring to obtain from the Shaikh a concession on the lines of those obtained from Dubai and Sharjah, but the Shaikh has resolutely refused to sign such a concession at the present time, and it was considered preferable to get him to grant us an exploration permit rather than to leave the terri tory entirely uncovered. The payments which he is to get under this permit are considerably greater than the payment under the previous option, which amounted to only Rs.9,000 a year. Longrigg writes 'It is probable that the time will come within the next 3|- years when the Shaikh will be better dis posed to a Concession than he is at present, and2 Tf.

Dear G-ibson, Will you please refer to your letter F.Z.6290/38 of the 3rd October, and previous correspondence, about oil concessions on the Trucial Coast, raised may be summarised as follows:- (1) The ultimatum of 1937. We agree that His Majesty*s Government should not be led by the opposition of the outstanding Sheikhs to withdraw from the ultimatum restricting the Trucial Coast to petroleum Concessions Ltd, (2) improvement in financial offers. that an improved financial offer at the present juncture by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. will have undesirable reactions on the Sheikhs who have already concluded agreements with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. on the terms originally offered. They may well consider His Majesty’s Government to be responsible for the financial loss which they will consider themselves to have suffered as a result of accepting, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, concessions at less favourable rates. Further, improvement of terms as a price for resistance may have a bad effect on our subsequent dealings with the Sheikhs generally. financial terms must remain primarily a question between the Company and the Sheikh, and therefore, if the Company are prepared themselves, without pressure from the Government, to improve their offer, we would be prepared to acquiesce. The Admiralty’s views on the various points There appears to us to be considerable danger Nevertheless, it appears to us that the ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL LETTER J.P. Gibson, Esq., INDIA OFFICE, S. W . 1.2 ' f We would, however, desire that, so far as possible, improvement should be in respect of payments between which direct comparison is difficult, rather than in the rate of royalty, and that there should be as little obvious differentiation between the Sheikhs as possible. (3) Sheikhs co-operation in Political Agreement. The Admiralty has felt considerable doubt as to the advisability or necessity of relaxing, for the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Has al Khaimah, and the lesser recalcitrant Sheikhs, the formalities insisted on for instance at Debai, The reasons for our doubts may be summarised (a) It is true that the need for co-operation in the Political Agreement did apparently deter Has al Khaimah from signing. This Ras al Khaimah, himself, having stood out so long, may be unwilling to sign on the original terms even if we relax this condition for him. We may well, therefore, be no better off, but have suffered some loss of prestige, if we give way on the Political Agreement at this juncture. (b) Also only after considerable discussion did we give way, and then only partially, to the Sultan of Muscat^, over the same question. It will^help our relations with him, if, after so much difficulty with him. arguments adduced to the contrary, to be a valuable asset in certain contingencies. The safeguards in the agreements about which the Admiralty is particularly concerned are:- (i) the provision stipulating that the concessionnaire shall remain British. (ii) the Pre-emption clause attaching to the Political Agreement. (1 ii; the Refinery Agreements v/ith the Companies. as follows cp.z. ^4^ *) O^Xy A, a consideration has v not,so far as we can see, arisen at Abu Dhabi, and there is no indication that Abu Dhabi would fall into line if this accepted procedure were dropped, we now give way, more easily, and more completely, to the lesser Sheikhs. (c) The Sheikhs' sanction does appear, in spite of Provided /X n f 3 Provided the Company does in fact remain British, it should be possible to take action in this country to enforce the pre-emption and refinery agreements. Oil Companies are, however, essentially international: Petroleum Concessions Ltd. itself is only partly British, and the validity of the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company that it shall not change its nationality, seems doubtful. Further, it is always possible, by means of holding Companies, etc., or simply by purchase of shares, for transfer of effective control to be made to some second country without change in the nominal character of the Company. There may well be circumstances in the future in which, apart from some clear external sanction, we would have difficulty in enforcing our agreement with the original concessionnaire Company. The Sheikhs 7 sanction does provide a clear right to His Majesty’s Government to enforce its original agreement, whereas without it it might prove, at the least, legally and politically difficult to take strong action against the ultimate controllers of the original Company. And, apart from such considerations, there may always be found loopholes or legal difficulties in the political agreements which might make action even against a British controlled company difficult, apart from a clearly defined final sanction. The existence of such a sanction, hov/ever, would in itself make the Companies less inclined to prove difficult or attempt evasion. In view, however, of the agreement of your Advisers in the Gulf in favour of dispensing with the Sheikhs co-operation, we would, if the India Office and other interested Departments are satisfied that this is the best course, not stand in the way of a new attempt, on this basis, with Ras al Khaimah, and, if necessary, Abu Dhabi. We are not, however, in favour of releasing Debai We agree with your view that, if we are to decide now to drop the Sheikhs co-operation, it would not be worth while raising difficulty over an ’’endorsement” of the conunerciaX agreement.

We have no reason to suppose that this is not the case, and as you will see Weightman and Powle are definitely of opinion that we should fall in with the Company f s views. If this is done we would still insist on a Political Agreement between His Majesty f s Government and the Company (including the important pre-emption clauses) and if it is thought desirable we could (as was suggested ir^Jyour (H) letter No.P.D.859/4 Part I of the 25th Ce^ ^ 7) April last on the subject of the Muscat Oil Agreement) require the Company to include a clause in the commercial agreement to the effect that the concession shall only be transfer able to a British Company registered in Great Britain and having its principal in i-to place of business in this country.

Fowle’s view on this point is that we need not at this stage release Sharjah and Dehai from their obligations and that matters should he left as they are ^mtil the Sheikhs themselves raised the question.Subject point (discussed in paragraph 5 of Peel's d.o. letter to Weightman No.P.Z.5684/38 of the 25th August, and paragraph 2 of Weightman's reply of the of having the concession agreement accompanied by an endorsement or I \ clause^jWhich would he binding on both parties,to the effect that it is subject to His Majesty's Government's approval.

When putting this point to Weightman it was ppQ6um»d that a decision in regard to the Sheikhs co-operation in respect of the political agreement would not he taken until the comme^ial agreement had heen signed; hut if we are to take this decision now it seems to us (and Fowle agrees) that the need for re-emphasising the position of His Majesty’s Government no longer arises* The Company fully understand that, in accordance with the general oil undertaking signed hy the Sheikhs our approval of the concession is » ♦ • , required, and there is no reason to anticipate that theet will he difficult in the matter of the political agreement^ 'n any case the point can he put in writing to the Company before negotiations are re-opened.

In regard to your first question I entirely agree that it is essential to include in any future Commercial Agreement an endorsement (or clause) that it is subject to the approval of His Majesty^ Government. If we are to dispense with the Shaikh’s co-operation in the Political Agreement - and I fully agree with Sir Trenchard Powle that we should do so - then this must be our minimum require- ment; and it is from every point of view preferable to Longrigg’s suggestion of a warning letter to the Shaikhs. 3. As for your second point, I think I should say first that in my opinion a modification or simplification of the Political Agreement and of the complementary exchange of letters would have no practical value. If we are to facilitate the Company’s negotiations at all we must be prepared to dispense altogether with the Shaikhs* cognisance of and co-operation in the Political Agreement. There may perhaps be, as a result, some talk on the Coast of His Majesty’s Government climbing doym, but there need be little fear of sny serious loss of prestige provided we take the bull by the horns and inform the Coast of this decision through the Shaikhs of Debai and Sharjah. In other words I /rj. — 2 — I suggest that both these Shaikhs should be informed that His Majesty’s Government have now come to the conclusion that from their point of view it is unnecessary to invite their (the Shaikhs’) co-operation in any Agreement which may have been,or may be in the future, reached between His Majesty’s Government and the Company; and that consequently, while appreciating their (Debai’s and Sharjah’s) co-operative attitude towards this question, His Majesty’s Government now propose to regard the entire correspondence with them relating to the subject of the Political Agreement as void and of no practical effect* 4 . I anticipate that a communication in such terms would excite so much speculation - and uncertainty - in regard to His Majesty’s Government’s motives that our loss of prestige would be negligible* And, after all, it is scarcely useful or reasonable to have some Shaikhs adhering,-3- years for his overweening self-conceit to yield to the pressure of local influence (an euphemism for the anxiety of his relatives and advisers to get ther hands on some of Petroleum Concessions Limited’s morj qy with the least possible delay)* It is clear that the greater anxiety Petroleum Concessions limited exhibit e.g# by over-import unity or by hints of increased offers the less effect can these local influences have* Squally we ourselves must do nothing which may encourage the Shaikh to believe that we have our anxieties, and it follows that if we are to send him reminders of the 'Petroleum Concessions Limited or no one' ultimatum, or hints that His Majesty’s Government really mean it, they must be hung on to some action of his own - for example a renewed approach to California Standard# And indeed one cannot hint to a Trucial Shaikh that His Majesty’s Government mean what they say; in making such a communication one must use the most explicit language# It is true that the information given by Ballantyne in his interview with Gibson on the 9th June 1938 (cf. the enclosure to Gibson’s letter Ho. P.Z.3881/38 of the 3rd June 1938 to Seal) provides an excellent excuse for such a warning; but I see two objections to using it, (a) it is now a little too late and (b) it might prejudice the possibility of Abu Dhabi aid to the exploration party at Baraimi (cf. my demi-official letter No.C/6C0,_ dated the 3rd September 1938)# Nevertheless other opportunities may occur later and, subject to the requirements of the moment, a reminder or warning could then be sent# 7. Recently Shaikh Ahmad bin Khalaf bin ’Utaibali, one of the most influential men in Abu Dhabi, informed the Residency Agent-4- Agent at Sharjah, that he could negotiate the Abu Dhabi Oil Concession within ten days - though he omitted to add on wnat terms. Though he is a most untrustworthy individual it is conceivable that his boast indicates some change of heart in the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and Petroleum Concessions Limited*a representative may find his task easier this winter. Nevertheless I would advise against any prolonged stay by the latter in Abu Dhabi unless the omens are distinctly favourable. I am convinced that by far the best possible course lies in an attitude of unconcern towards the Shaikh while the local influences to which I have referred above (carefully encouraged in their expectations) continue to increase their pressure. 8. There are of course other complications so far as Abu Dhabi is concerned. Much may depend on the decisions reached regarding Khor el Odeid and the action to be taken to dis courage slave trade. As, however, decisions on both these questions may be delayed indefinitely it will serve no object at the present juncture to discuss their possible effects.\V (S 423^/19/91) io FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 9th September, 1938, kf- ^ enforced in the courts here.

My dear Gibson, With reference to your letter P.Z. 2255/38 of the 23rd April I mentioned to Symon over the telephone some days ago that we for our part were prepared to concur in the proposal no longer to attempt to associate the Sultan of Muscat with the agreement which it is proposed to conclude between His Majesty f s Government and Petroleum Concessions Limited in regard to the recently concluded Muscat and Dhofar Oil Concessions. In the meantime we understand that a further approach has been made to the Sultan and that he has agreed to associate himself with an agreement, in regard to the Muscat and Dhofar Commercial Oil Concessions, between His Majesty’s Government and the concessionaire. I nevertheless enclose a copy of a minute by Beckett, written when the question of no longer attempting to bring the Sultan into the proposed political agreement was under examination. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) T.V. Brenan. J.P. Gibson, Esq, V-Nj© 0L t- Copy . (E 2505/137/91) As Mr. Gibson states in his letter P.Z. 2255/38 of the 23rd April, the whole object of this elaborate scheme of the communication of the Political Agreement to the Sultan, the exchange of notes with the Sultan and the further exchange of notes with the company was to enable the Sultan to terminate the concession if the company broke the Political Agreement and as far as possible to bind the Sultan to do so; in other words, to have the sanction of the termination of the concession to ensure the performance by the company of the Political Agreement. If all this procedure has to be abandoned then the sanction for the performance by the company of the Political Agreement-becomes (1) the influence which H.M.G. can exercise with the company; (2) the enforcement of the Political Agreement in the courts here. As regards (1) other people are in a better position to express an opinion than I am. Question (2) is one on which the Treasury Solicitor might be consulted if more information is required, but I will make a few remarks upon it, taking the provisions of the Political Agreement in order to see how the position stands. The first question is v/hether the agreement is one which could be enforceable in the courts of this country at all, and I think the answer to this is in principle, in the affirmative, though except as regards the pre-emption clause, the provisions of the agreement are not very suitable for such a procedure. In order however to show that there is 'consideration' (i.e. that there was a/ {a quid pro quo in return for which the company have thus bound themselves), I think the recitals at the beginning of the agreement might be reconsidered and the fact that the concession from the Sultan was subject to the consent of H.M.G. and that H.M.G* have consented thereto, in return for this agreement, might be brought out. Clauses (1) and (2) of the Political Agreement provide that the company shall remain a British company and that it shall not transfer the concession to anybody except withH.M.G. f s consent. I think that these provisions would be enforceable through the courts and that provided H.M.G. heard of it in time, they could probably get clause (2) enforced by an injunction. Damages for an unauthorised transfer would hardly be a possible remedy or sanction. Conceivably, but I am not quite sure, clauses (3) to (5) might be enforceable through the English courts by orders for specific performance. As regards clause (7)conceivably a claim for damages could be put forward so far as areas selected by H.M.G. were concerned and would be an effective deterrent. Clause (8) might possibly be made the subject of an injunction (I ought to have indicated above that this agreement would of course not merely be enforceable against the company so long as it remained British in the courts in this country, but also in the courts of the Political Agent in Muscat). Clause (9) - pre-emption - would clearly be enforceable by the courts and under the new arrangement I do not see why it should not stay where it is, i.e. in the body of the political agreement and not in a separate document; it is a clause which could be enforced by an order for specific performance or by judgment for damages.

My dear Gibson, With reference to your letter P.Z. 2255/38 of the 23rd April, I write to confirm my telephone message that the Admiralty are prepared as a special case, to accept the arrangement under which the Sultan of Muscat would not be party to the Political Agreement.

Millbank, London, S*W*1. 25th April, 1938. IMMEDIATE - BY HAND . My dear Gibson, I am sorry that I was unable to see you the other day when you called to see me about the Muscat and Oman Political Agreement. In reply to your letter (P.Z. 2255/38) of 23rd April, in which you ask for our concurrence in the proposal to conclude a political agreement with the Company leaving the Sultan out of it altogether, I am sure you appreciate that the original idea of the political agreement was largely to ensure as strong a form of British control clause as was practicable with an international company like the Iraq Petroleum Company (or Petroleum Concessions Ltd.). There can be no guarantee that the status of the company will not be altered in the absence of a specific provision for a penalty which would involve cancellation of the concession. If the provision in the commercial agreement (Clause 23) stands, a subsidiary company registered in the | British Empire could hold the concession, and as such a company would not be required to have its principal place of business in this country nor a British Chairman, it seems to me that the prospect of being able successfully to impose any penalty on the parent company would be remote. J.P. Gibson, Esq*, Indi a Office, King Charles Street, S.W.l.If the commercial agreement had not been signed I should have been in favour of trying to get an amendment to ^ meet the point, and Fraser, the Deputy Chairman of the \ Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., with whom I have discussed the point confidentially, would have done all he could to secure this. As the agreement has been signed this is not practicable and we must, I think, concur in the proposal to drop the idea of tying up the Commercial and Political Agreement in this case, provided, of course, it is not to be taken as in any way creating a precedent for other concessions which may be negotiated hereafter. I assume that you will let us see the Political Agreement with the company in draft, before it is finally signed and sealed. I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal and Brenan. Yours sincerely.

As a matter of tactics we have felt that it would be best to postpone discussing this question with the Sultan until the 'treaty” talks were concluded. That stage has now been reached and the Sultan has himself told us that he would like to discuss the question; but from casual hints which he has let fall it is abundantly clear that except under strong pressure he will not have anything to do with the agreement himself. In the circumstances we have been reconsidering the whole question and particularly from the point of view whether it is really essential to obtain the Sultan’s co-operation. Our views are set out in the enclosed department -al note and we should be glad to hear as soon as possible whether the (1) Foreign Office would see any objection (2) Admiralty (3) Petroleum Department to our proceeding on the lines suggested therein.

Gibson,P.Z.2255/38 Political Agree ment between Hi s Majesty^ Government and Petroleum C once ssions Ltd« in respe_c_t of the Muscat oil concessions • Prom casual hints which the Sultan has let fall since his arrival it is abundantly clear that, except under strong pressure, he will not have anything to do with the proposed Political Agreement between H.M.G. and the concession Company. It is true that when the matter v/as discussed with him at Bombay last November he went so far as to criticise certain Articles of the draft which was put before him by the Political Agent, but since that time his attitude has stiffened and in such circumstances it seems desirable to consider whether it is really essential to obtain his co-operation. The procedure which we previously had in mind (and which has been adopted in the case of two of the Trucial Sheikhs) is as follows First, the Agreement between H.M.G. and the Concession Company; next, an Exchange of Notes with the Sultan in which the latter would take note that in the event of a serious breach of the Agreement on the part of the Company he would have the right to terminate the Commercial Concession, and would agree to accept the advice of H.M.G. in regard to this right of termination; next, an Exchange of Notes with the concession Company in which the latter would accept the arrangements embodied in the Exchange of Notes with the Sultan as binding on the Company; and finally, a letter to the Company and the Sultan intimating that H.M.G. approve the commercial agreement. Stated bluntly the sole object of bringing in the / Rulers/r t€ im 2. Rulers concerned is to provide a sanction against the Company and what we have to consider now is whether, in * I say » ”possib^ , the case of Muscat, this ,, possible ,, sanction can be because the most we can disregarded. The answer would seem to depend on whether hope for is that the we can rely on the concession holding Company remaining Sultan v/ould agree a British company. This Department is not in a position to accept our 'advice'to form an opinion on the point, but from tentative soundings in the matter and which have already been made at the Petroleum Department we mi ght have no and at the Foreign Office it would appear that there is little effective redress if likelihood of the Iraq Petroleum Company (the parent Company) he failed to do so. or its subsidiaries becoming non-British; and even although the political agreement itself does not include a penalty clause (and it does not seem desirable that it should do so) it is thought that so long as the Company remains British we shall always be in a position to see that it fulfils its obligations to H.M.G. That being so it is suggested that we might take the risk of leaving out the Sultan. If this view is accepted we should then conclude an agreement with the Company, somewhat on the lines of the original draft, and there after inform both the Company and the Sultan that H.M.G. approve the commercial agreement.

Trucial Coast Oil Concessions^ Mr. Peel , After discussion with you I submit a draft demi-official letter to Mr. Weightraan and a draft covering letter to Sir Trenchard Fowle in regard to the above. As you know I have recently discussed this question v/ith Mr. Longrigg. He has told me that the Company are genuinely anxious to get the concessions as soon as possible (this winter if it can be done) and that, within limits, and provided that in other respects the concession agreements are satisfactory from'their point of view, their last cash offers to the Sheikhs need not necessarily be regarded as the final word. As regards Ras al Khaimah the Company are quite convinced that but for our requirements in regard to the Political Agreement the Sheikh v/ould have put his signature to the Concession Agreement last March. In such circumstances they feel that in the absence of some form of pressure on the Sheikh from His Majesty’s Government (and I told Mxu that this seemed hardly practicable) their only hope of clinching matters within a reasonable time is that they should be given unfettered freedom to negotiate and conclude the Agreement with the Sheikh leaving questions concerningsuggestion it would probably be considered necessary for the commercial agreement to be endorsed,at the time of signature,by both parties ; to the effect that it was subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Longrigg, however, dislikes this as he thinks that it might frighten the Sheikh and he has suggested that if we attach importance to the point the best course would be for the Political Authorities to write at once to the Sheikh (and perhaps also to the other Sheikhs at the same time)ve^A- jftifccthat in accordance with his written undertaking any oil concession which he may grant hereafter will be subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. As regards Abu Dhabi, Mr. Longrigg said that unless the Sheikh toad prepared to withdraw his demand for ”Ibn Saud terms” it seemed impossible to make any headway. He, therefore, hoped that it would be possible for Government to take some action which might induce this Sheikh to become more amenable.w Department. 25 AUG 1938 Copy to Tnptla l 5 ^/ Petroleum Dept .

For present purposes we need not consider Umm al Quwain, Ajman or Kalha since there is no reason to suppose that if the other Trucial Sheikhs agree to grant concessions these smaller States will not follow suit. 4. The real difficulty is in regard to Has al Khaimah and Abu Dhabi. As regards the former, it would appear probable that the Political Agreement has a good deal to do with the difficulty, even though, as stated by Fowle, it may not by itself actually have prevented the grant of a concession. At any rate the Company are quite convinced that but for our requirements in this respect the Sheikh would have put his signature to the Concession Agreement last March, and they have therefore put forward very strongly their view that in the absence of some form of pressure on the Sheikh from His Majesty’s Government (and this seems hardly practicable; their only hope of clinching matters within a reasonable time is that they should be given unfettered freedom to negotiate and conclude an agreement with the Sheikh, leaving questions concerning the Political Agreement aside until the concession has been signed/Department. 3. signed. Fowle has suggested that in all the circumstances the 'best course to pursue would be to retain the Political Agreement as between ourselves' and the Company but not to require its cognisance by the Sheikhs, and I imagine therefore that you would see no objection to the course suggested by the Company; but before we consult the other interested departments in the matter there are two points on which we should be glad to have your views. 5. Firstly, we feel, and have so informed Longrigg, that if we agree to leave the Political Agreement question aside for further consideration, it would be necessary for the commercial agreement to be endorsed, at the time of signature, by both parties, to the effect that it was subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. Longrigg, however, dislikes this as he thinks that it might frighten the Sheikhs and he has suggested that if we attach importance to the point the best course would be for the Political Authorities to write at once to each Sheikh reminding them that in accordance with their written under takings any oil concessions which they may grant hereafter will be subject to4. the ppproval of His Majesty’s Government. We feel here, however, that any such communication might do more harm than good and that it would he preferable to have the Concession Agreement endorsed in the manner suggested. Would you please let me know what you think? 6. The second point is this. Can you say what are likely to he the re actions of the Sheikhs of Sharjah and Dehai if, in due course, we decide in the case of the other Trucial Sheikhs either (a) to modify or simplify the Political Agreements and complementary exchange of notes, or (h) to dispense altogether with the Sheikhs’ co-operation in the Political Agreement; e.g. would they (and the other Sheikhs) regard it as a climh-down on the part of H.M.G. and if so how far would this result in a lessening of our prestige in that part of the world? ?. I now turn to Ahu Dhahi. Here the position is different from that at Has al Khaimah in that although the Sheikh has heen offered more generous terms than those actually accepted hy his neighbours (and the offer is not necessarily the last word;, he persistently refuses to discuss/Draft Paper Department, 5. discuss 'business with Petroleum Concessions Limited ’'except on the same terms as Ihn Saud M . To this the Company are unable to agree and so far the question of the Political Agreement between H.M.G. and the Company has not arisen although the Sheikh is no doubt fully aware of our requirements in this respect. Prima facie the deadlock at Abu Dhabi appears to be more serious than elsewhere and we should therefore be glad to know whether you think there is any real likelihood of a change of heart on the part of the Sheikh should the Company attempt to re-open negotiations with him during the coming winter, and, if not, v/hether there is anything that we can do to induce him to see reason. Would it do any good, for instance, to send him a further note reminding him of the ”P,C.L. or no one” ultimatum with a hint that H.M.G. really mean what they say? 8.

P£ELean Stanley Street, Millbank, London, S.W.l. August, 1938. Dear Peel, I am sorry not to have replied sooner to your letter of the 11th June (P.Z. 3639/38) asking for our observations on the financial terms offered to the Trucial Sheikhs by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. You ask how these compare with cases where concessions have been granted as a result of competition. On this point I drew attention at the meeting recently held at the India Office on the question of the unallotted area of Bahrein to the fact that the granting of oil concessions on a competitive basis is most unusual. I have also explained to you verbally that the effect of adopting such a procedure in the Persian Gulf areas may have serious repercussions elsewhere on the activities of British oil companies, which we shduld wish to avoid. As I told you we have recently been helping the Colonial Office to revise the Colonial Model legislation for the grant R. Peel, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1. tfr. •; &gt; J2ACQ1938 INDIA OFFICE \of oil concessions and copies will shortly he available of the final draft which will enable you to see the basis on which it is proposed to work. The conditions are laid down anc' &gt;f one applicant competing with anc _ l be more than one applicant the Government will decide, having regard to the priority of applications, which is the more suitable concern. A nominal fee is charged for an exploration licence. During the period of prospecting licence a certain annual / rental of 5/- per square mile for the first four years and 10/- per square mile during any extension of this period is proposed. Under a Mining Lease a certain annual rental starting at 1/- per acre and rising in the 10th year to 6/- per acre is proposed. To the extent that royalties become payable the annual rentals may be deducted from the royalties. The rate of royalty proposed is 3/- per ton. Under a revision of royalties clause which may be brought into operation every ten years, there is a provision that the minimum rate of royalty shall be 2/- and the maximum rate 6/-.

To translate the lump sum and annual payments to a common 'basis one must know the areas of the conceded territories; and in some instances it is impossible to do this in the absence of information about the actual boundaries of the States. From what I have said above, you will see that the rates of royalty compare favourably with those proposed for new concessions in our Colonies. In this country we have not published the royalty rates, but I can let you know confidentially that we are charging 4/- per ton and that in a country where there is a ready market for any production, i From what I have said you will see that we have no difficulty in advising you that the terms which have been and are being offered to the Sheikhs are fair. I have already expressed the view that as U.S. interests are already represented in Petroleum Concessions Ltd. on an g. equal footing with other nationalities, we are justified in not facilitating the further penetration of the Standard Oil Company of California into the Persian Gulf areas under our control and that we should not allow the stubbornness-4- of the Trucial Sheikhs who have not yet granted concessions to influence us in this matter. I might even suggest that it would he unfair to those Sheikhs who have already granted concessions to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. if their more obdurate neighbours, as a result of their present attitude, were to be encouraged to obtain better terms, either from Petroleum Concessions Ltd. or from the Standard Oil Company of California.

Mr. Ballantyne called this afternoon to speak about a Cable he had received from Bahrein. In it Mr. Thornberg said he had been told by one oi the Sheikhly family that the Sheikh wanted to give the whole of the area to the Bahrein petroleum Company but was atraid that he v/ould be punished, if he did so, by the loss of Kawar. Mr. Ballantyne said that to his mind the Sheikh’s fear was fantastic but he wanted our assistance In dispelling it. It was clear enough that he hoped to receive an explicit denial which he would transmit as from the India Office, but his specific suggestion was that we might report the matter to the Resident and get him to tell the Sheikh through the political Agent that his fear of being penalised by the loss of Hawar was quite unfounded. I said I thought that in the circumstances it would be best if the matter were cleared up locally with the Political Agent either by the Sheikh or his relatives or by Mr. Thornberg. The political Agent, after all, was immediately concerned in the negotiations, and he was in the best position to give an effective answer to the Sheikh or his relatives, whom of course he knew well. Mr. Ballantyne appeared to be disappointed but he agreed that it would be best to take the matter up with the Political Agent. (It may be that one of his reasons for showing no enthusiasm for the suggestion is his reluctance to disclose the name of Mr. Thornberg's informant, as it was for this reason that he did not show me the actual telegram which he had with him). Before/© 133- 2. Before leaving, Mr. Ballantyne mentioned that his Company had had another letter from the Sheikh of Ahu Dhabi, who was anxious to treat with the Company and professed to be completely freed from any obligations to Government. The Sheikh had been given a similar answer to the reply given him last year, to the effect that the Company were not at present in a position to discuss matters with him. But Mr. Ballantyne added that his Company might before very long wish to enter into negotiations with the Sheikh, though of course before they did so they would come and discuss matters with us. He said that Abu Dhabi objected to Petroleum Concessions Limited because of the political obligations with which a concession given to them would be tied up.Sir F. Stev/art r A comparative statement is attached of the main financial terms of a number of oil concessions in the Persian Gulf. It will be seen that there is a great variation in the amount of the minimum annual payments (dead rent). Those offered on the Trucial Coast are actually better than what was provided at Bahrein andjprovided for at Dhofar. Even when compared with Muscat, Koweit or Qatar, they do not appear too oad, having regard to the relative size and importance of the various places. v /e might, however, go into the matter further and perhaps ask the Petroleum Dept, what they think of the financial terms offered, in comparison with cases where concessions have been granted as a result of competition, and whether they think that the rate of royalty, which is Rs.3 everywhere in the Gulf except at Bahrein (Rs.3£), is reasonable in comparison with royalties elsewhere. he shall then be in a position to consider at the end of the six months’ waiting period whether or not to suggest to P.G.L. that the terms offered should be improved/0 V improved in any respects, having regard to the fact that they are being given a privileged position for negotiating. i*. s-:/The Hon KO. i ggh Z. 3639/38 INDIA OPPICSj 'WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 28th May, 1938. )vv^ cU^AJ '^^ rU ^Jty / Would you kindly refer to paragraph 4- of the record of the informal meeting at the India Office on the 12th April with the representatives of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd.

We agree that in the light of the difficulties which the Company have experienced in their negotiations with the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast for the grant of oil concessions it would he best to leave matters in abeyance for say six months and we are prepared to advise the Company accordingly. We are, however, somewhat concerned as to the possibility of a difficult situation arising if, at the end of the waiting period, the Company again fail, through no fault of their own, to obtain concessions from the remaining/ ’ble Lieutenant Colonel Sir Trenchard Powle, KCIE., CBE. , H.B.M.

In this connection we have been considering Lewisohn’s suggestion that our insistence on having the co-operation of the Sheikh in regard to the Political Agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Company may have something to do with the Sheikhs’ refusal to come to terms and we should be glad to have your opinion on the point. If you consider that there is something in it, or tha.t the somewhat complex arrangements for exchanging notes with the Sheikhe relative to the Political Agreement are liable to arouse misunderstanding or suspicion in their minds, it might be advisable, following the recent precedent of Muscat , to consider whether there are a.ny points in the Agreement itself, or - more particularly - in the complementary Exchanges of Motes, which might be modified or/» 3. or simplified, without materially lessening the value of those documents, so as to make them more acceptable to the Sheikhs concerned; for example, is there any real necessity to require the Sheikh to obtain our approval in regard to the setting up of a Bank ? e should be glad to have your views on this suggestion. In the last resort we should be prepa.red, if you consider that the circumstances justify it and that the Company’s prospects of clinching ma.tters would be substantially increased thereby, to consider, in consultation with the other interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government, wnether we can take the risk of dispensing altogether with the Sheikh’s co-operation in the Political Agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government.

Please see para. 4(A) of the note of a meeting with representatives of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. on 12th April regarding the difficulties which the Coy. have encountered in their negotiations with the Trucial She Mis Progress has been very slow for some time past, and in June last year, on the Resident’s urgent recommendation, we authorised him to inform the Sheikhs in the sense of para. 2 of the telegram of 17th June flagged on the file. The four Sheikhs with whom negotiations are still outstanding have been informed accordingly, and Sir T. Fowle has advised that the Coy. should leave them alone for, say, six months; he thinks that the Sheikhs nay then be prepared to accept the reasonable terms which the Coy. offer. This is no doubt the best course for the immediate future, but it seems desirable to consider what our policy should be if, after such an interval, the Sheikhs and the Coy, still fail to come to agreement. On the one hand, we do not want to have the rival (American/company on the Trucial Coast, where conditions are quite different from Bahrein or Koweit, and we should be/be faced with the question of protection of personnel, in regard to which it is much easier to deal with a partly British than with an entirely foreign concessionaire. On the other hand, it may not be necessary indefinitely to exclude a company which is willing to competent P.C.L., after naving had a good start, fail to come to agreement with the Sheikhs. The P.C.L. representatives also thought that the rather complicated system of obtaining the .Sheikhs’ endorsement of the political agreement (which is between H.M.G. and the Coy.) by means of exchanges of letters may act as a partial deterrent against the Sheikhs granting concessions. We might also, therefore, consider whether the Sheikhs’ endorsements of the political agreements are essential t and if so, whether the machinery for obtaining it could not be somewhat simplified. fhe draft letter consults Sir T.

Av^&lt; 'W' I submit a draft d.o. letter to Sir Trenchard Powle on the lines discussed at our meeting with Mr. Walton on Saturday morning.Record of an Informal Meeting held at the India Office on the 12th April, to discuss the activities of Petroleum Concessions, Limited on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. PRESENT: Mr. R. T. Peel (in the Chair) Sir T.Powle ) ) Mr. Lewisohn ) Mr. Gibson ) India Office. ) ) Mr. Longrigg ) Mr. Symon ) ) Representing Petroleum Concessions Limited. Mr. Longrigg opened the discussion by saying that there were three matters which he wished to raise, viz: - A. The position in regard to the Koweit Neutral Zone; B. The position in regard to the Bahrein Unallotted Area; C. The position on the Trucial Coast, etc. 2. With regard to A. (the Koweit Neutral Zone), Mr. Longrigg said that as a result of our refusal to allow Major Holmes to act as their negotiator at Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast, Major Holmes had severed his connection with Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and thes* Company were afraid that he might now resume his connection with the California Company. Major Holmes was now at Koweit to consult with the Sheikh regarding the Neutral Zone and owing to his influence with the Sheik; they were apprehensive lest he might persuade the Sheiknto give the concession to American interests before Petroleum1^1 • r A ^ ScjX+AMtt-Ll ) Concessions Ltd. had 'been given a further opportunity of putting forward their proposals. Mr. Longrigg then went on to express the hope that His Majesty's Government might feel their way to discourage American interests, or at least ensure that the Sheikkdid not cede his oil rights in the Heutral Zone until Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had been given a fair opportunity of competing. He was promised that the Company's views would receive consideration. 3. With regard to B. (the Bahrein Unallotted Area , Mr. Longrigg referred to his previous call on the 31st March, at which he had left a copy of the Company's draft lease relating to parts of the Bahrein Unallotted -n-rea and he said that here again the Company were concerned about the future intentions of Major Holmes, who was fully informed as to their proposals. The Company were satisfied that there was little chance of the SheikKof Bahrein giving them the whole of the Unallotted Area and that they had been led to believe that the SheikKintended to give everything except the Kawar Group of islands to the Americans. For this reason they had departed from their original intention to compete for the whole of the Unallotted Area; but while they were prepared to leave the main island out of their plans, they wanted rather more than the Hawar Group and he hoped that His Majesty’s Government would feel able to support the Company on the basis of the draft concession. Sir Trenchard Fowle intervened at this stage to point out that the Company s proposed concession area included certain islands (i.e. the Hawar Group and Fasht Dibal) whose ownership's between Bahrein and watar, had not yet been clearly determined. While on the evidence at present available to His Majesty’s^ ^ rC ^ ^ fkL 2) tU ^ Lh&gt; fa) UffCt /aJ\M-^K LaaJ^ ^ l ■YvJLlA C&lt;+*A [&gt;5 iruA^Jt*- 1 ^- AnrvlL ^ /vA^&gt;v ^ / ^ lY/£AA*tA*L 3. Government these islands 'belonged to Bahrein there was reason to suppose that the Sheik of ^atar might wish to advance claims to them and he thought that it might 'be preferable to ask the Sheikh of Bahrein to postpone the resumption of negotiations for a short period (say two or three months) in order that the question of ownership could he finally determined. This suggestion had been put to Lord Cadman in a recent conversation and it was understood that His Lordship was agreeable. Mr. Longrigg said, however, that the Company were opposed to any postponement and he personally thought it would be a pity to put ideas of ownership into the mind of the Sheik of 4atar. He pointed out, moreover, that if enquiries showed that the islands in question belonged to the Sheik/t of 4atar, they would be included in the concession which the Company had already obtained from that Ruler; and he said that by entering into negotiations with the oheikfiof Bahrein for them, the Company were merely running the risk of paying twice for the same thing. The Company were prepared to take this chance and would definitely prefer to carry on with the negotiations without any postponement. Sir Trenchard Fowle said that he had not appreciated the latter point and that in the circumstances he was inclined to withdraw his suggestion for postponing the negotiations. Mr. Peel wound up this part of the discussion by saying that the views put forward on behalf of the Company would be~~caref ully considered ancTthat a decision would be given as soon as possible. 4. With regard to C. (the Trucial Coast, etc.), Mr. Longrigg said that there were two separate points,viz: (D ( 2 ) Concessions; Exploration.With regard to (1) (Concessions), the present position was that the Company had obtained concessions in respect of Debai and Sharjah; but so far all efforts to induce the remaining SheiWb to come into line had proved unavailing. As far as was reasonably possible, the Company had met the various demands put forward by the Sheilcs and he thought that fully adequate terms had been u offered; but the Sheiks seemed to be completely out of hand and appeared to be convinced that eventually they could get whatever terms they liked to ask. A state of deadlock had been reached and the Company felt that unless His Majesty’s Government were prepared to intervene, the only alternative open to them was to temporarily withdraw their negotiators. Asked for his views, Sir Trenchard Fowle said he thought that if the Sheiks were left alone say six months, they wouldJcome round and accept the Company's offers. Mr. Longrigg said, however, that in oil matters waiting usually resulted in bigger demands and he thought that delay in coming to terms might make it more difficult for the Sheiks to withdraw from their present position. If, however, the Political Resident advised waiting, the Company would of course accept his advice, but they hoped that it would be found possible to do something to hasten matters. Mr. Lewisohn then ask e d if the Company coul d regard their present privileged positio n as watertight and was informed that for the present, at any rate, they had no need to worry on this score. Mr.Lewisohn then went on to say that he thought that the Political agreement might have something to do with the Sheik^of Ras al Khaimah’s refusal to come to terms and he asked whether His Majesty’s Government regarded it as essentialX mmt+ l?tf- 5. iJ&gt;CL j / to obtain the Sheikas agreement. Mr. Longrigg agreed with his colleague and suggested that the terras of the agreement were sufficiently binding on the Company without \ bringing in the Sheikh. Mr. Peel pointed out, however, that as two of the Sheiks, namely Debai and Sharjah, had recognised the agr eements, it might be difficult not to follow the same procedure in the case of the others, but he promised that the question would be re-examined. As regards exploration, Mr. Longrigg said that W) from the Company’s point of view, the present situation was completely unsatisfactory. He said that although much of the territory concerned could probably be written off as valueless, some parts appeared to have definite interest and they must see it all. Up to the present the Company’s efforts to visit certain ’’interesting” areas through the medium of the Trucial Sheiks^, had been unsuccessful and the Company had formed the conclusion that it would probably be best to leave the Trucial Sheiks alone for the time being and to try and operate through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg mentioned in this connection that he had seen the Sultan during the latter’s recent visit to London and had been told that in addition to certain parts of Muscat territory , the Sultan might be able to arrange for a party to reach Baraimi (which the Sultan hasr belonging to him) through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg said that this suggestion seem ed to offer greater promise of getting something done and he enquired wnether it might not be possible for His Majesty's Government to co-operate with the Sultan. He was promised that the point would be considered.z jl 'v/ K ~ 6 . 5. Sir Trenchard Powle mentioned that during his recent conversation with Lord Cadman he had heen asked to suggest the name of a suitable person to act for Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. in connection with the forthcoming negotiations at Bahrein and Koweit. Sir T. Powle said that normally he would hesitate to give advice, but as the present circumstances were somewhat peculiar he was prepared to do so. The names which occurred to him were Messrs. Longrigg, Lermitte and Packer and he said that so far as the local Political authorities were concerned, all these gentlemen would be acceptable. He also thought that they would be acceptable to the Rulers concerned. INDIA OFFICE, 12th April 1933.1 Activities of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. on the Trucial Coast, etc. present situation in regard to Petroleum Concessions Limited’s negotiations may be summarised as follows. Debai. The Company have obtained a concession which has been approved by H. M.G. Shar.jah . The Company have obtained a concession which, subject to certain formalities, will be approved by H.M.G. Abu Dhabi . The Company*s option expired on the 3rd January, 1938. They have been negotiating for a concession over a long period, but the Sheikh refuses to negotiate unless he is given the same terms as were granted * to Ibn Saud for the Hedjaz concession of 1936. All attempts, including a visit from the Political Resident, have failed to move the Sheikh. He has been offered terms similar to those successfully negotiated by the Company at Sharjah and Debai but with considerably increased money payments in view of his larger area. In view, however, of the complete lack of progress after three months’ patient negotiation, the Company see no alternative to abandoning the attempt for the present. The Resident sees no immediate prospect of the Sheikh changing his mind but he thinks that if he is left alone in company with the other Sheikhs he will in time see reason. Ras-al-Khaimah . The Company’s option expired on the 1st August, 1937. The Company have been in active negotiation with the Ruler for some time, and after numerous absurd demands had been gradually given up by the Sheikh, it seemed likely at the beginning of this year that the Sheikh would accept/2 . accept Debai and Sharjah terms if a much greater ^ 4/v^^v ^ K ^ ^unofficial payment” was addefc l^* 2 ^ om P an y concluded that the right moment to make such a final offer had come, and about three weeks ago the Sheikh verbally accepted the Company’s offer of Debai terms plus an extra Rs.35,000 provided that there was nothing in the Exchange of Letters to scare him off. A few days later, however, he reverted to a demand for payments on the Qatar scale. The Company are not prepared to meet the Sheikh’s demands in this respect and they feel that they have no alternative but to instruct their negotiator to withdraw and return to Bahrein. A.iman . The Company’s option expired on 23rd January 1938. The Company recently suggested to the Sheikh that a concession should be negotiated but he asked to be left until last and was unwilling to talk at present. Umm-al-Q,aiwain . No option has been obtained. The Company’s negotiator called on the Ruler towards the end of last year. The latter stated that he was ready to begin negotiations with the Company but could not do so immediately as he had an ”understending” with the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah whereby he had promised not to come into agreement with the Company until that Ruler had signed. 2. About the middle of last year when the Company were negotiating with the Sheikhs of Sharjah and Ras-al- Khaimah it was felt by the local political authorities that these Rulers v/ere merely playing for time until their options expired so as to be free to enable them to negotiate with the Standard Oil Company . In order to avoid this danger it was decided, on the recommendation of tne Political Resident/3. Resident, to send an ultimatum to the Sheikhs in the following terms ’'Petroleum Concessions Limited are approved by His Majesty’s Government and were first in the field. They have already secured a concession from the Sheikh of Debai on terms satisfactory to his interests and are also offering satisfactory terms for other concessions. His Majesty’s Government do not wish to have more than one company operating on the Trucial Coast as this might lead to complications. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government are prepared to approve agreements with Petroleum Concessions Limited but they are not prepared to consider permitting negotiations with any other company.” The present position is that this ultimatum has been given to the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Umm-al-Qaiwain, Ras-al-Khaimah and Ajman, with all of whom the Company have failed to reach agreement. The Political Resident, as well as the Compan^, is now convinced that the reason why the Sheikhs concerned are still holding out against the Company is that they are not convinced that His Majesty's Government mean what they say. The latest reports from the Company's local negotiator indicate his conviction that the Trucial Sheikhs have now persuaded themselves and each other that the Company is, in the long run, bound to offer them whatever they ask and that His Majesty's Government has no intention of intervening. The Resident holds the view that we must stick to the terms of the ultimatum and prevent the Sheikhs entering into negotiations v/ith any other company; and he thinks that as time goes by and the Sheikhs, by not being permitted to enter into negotiations with any other company, £ realisi»g that His Majesty's Government do mean to abide by their ultimatum, will eventually accept Petroleum Concessions Limited's terms more or less as they stand at the moment. In such circumstances he suggests that the Company should stick to their original terms and leave the Sheikhs alone. The Company on the other hand whilst being / * perfectly/151. 4. perfectly willing to act in accordance with the Resident's ^ suggest ionfwvvi/e.. that further delay in reaching a settlement may encourage their foreign rivals to renew their interest in the territory concerned; and they are apprehensive lest pressure from their foreign rivals may result in their losing their present privileged position before they can come to terms. Our attitude on this point is as follows (1) We favour Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. (2) Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. are hung up in their negotiations because the Sheikhs concerned think they can do better with the Americans. (3) We have told the California Standard Oil Co. that we cannot approve their entering the field at this stage (on the grounds that Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. have priority). They have withdrawn for the present but have stated that they are anxious to compete if and whenever an opportunity occurs for them to do so with the consent of His Majesty's Government. When the question of presenting an ultimatum to the Sheikhs was under discussion we considered whether we should be discriminating unfairly against the standard Oil Co. The view then taken was that there would not really be any unfair discrimination since it is obviously desirable that there should not be more than one Company on the Trucial Coast and so long as the Sheikhs' interests are not sacrificed His Majesty's Government are entitled to bring pressure to bear upon them to secure that any concessions they may give should all be with the same Company. His Majesty's Government can also claim that they are5. responsible for seeing that Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. (who were first in the field) receive a square deal from the Sheikhs and to prevent the Sheikhs from using purely delaying tactics with a view to freeing themselves from the obligations of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. implicit in the options which had been given to the Company. As indicated in an earlier part of this note the Resident is of opinion that the Sheikhs are not convinced that His Majesty's Government mean what they say and he thinks that they must be made to do so. He also feels that to withdraw from the terms of the ultimatum would be a severe blow to our prestige in that part of the world. Thus a question of principle is involved, viz. are we prepared to keep to the terms of the ultimatum even in the face of pressure from foreign governments?P.Z.1241/1938. Extract from EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL) , dated 16th February 1938. from political Resident. Bushire. at Bahrain, to Secretary of State for India. London . 9. Apart from the particular instance of the Shaikh of Sharjah breaking his promise, there is a general attitude of obstruction and opposition to His Majesty’s Government, both latent and patent, amongst the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast at the present juncture, which is causing me some concern. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah, for instance, was guilty some time ago of an act of extreme discourtesy to one of His Majesty's Sloops, and has refused to send a letter of regret to the Senior Naval Officer. In consequence of this I have informed him that he will not receive the good offices of His Majesty’s Government, which includes the facilities of his travel papers. Some months have passed by since he was informed of this, but hitherto he has been obdurate. The various other Shaikhs, as you are aware, are adopting an extremely obstructive attitude towards the entirely reasonable terms of Petroleum Concessions Limited. There seems in fact to be a general feeling that the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast can flout with impunity the authority and wishes of His Majesty's Government.TELEPHONE : NATIONAL 35*2 TELEGRAMS : INLAND : PETCONCESS, FINSQUARE, LONDON FOREIGN : PETCONCESS, LONDON CODES : BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE BENTLEY’S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT LOMBARD PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED lUf- DIRECTORS : i Cadman, G.C.M.G.

He continues to ask parrot-like, for T, the same terms as Ibn Saud', which terms - presumably those of our Hejaz Concession of 1956 - there is no possibility of his obtaining. We offered him terms similar to those successfully negotiated at Sharjah and Dubai, but with considerably increased money payments in view of his larger area. In view of the complete lack of progress at Abu Dhabi after three months patient negotiation, we see no alterna tive to abandoning the attempt for the present. Do you agree? At Ras al Khaimah, after numerous absurd demands h?,d been gradually given up by the Shaikh, it seemed likely, from late December 1957&gt; that the Shaikh would accept Dubai-Sharjah terms if a rather greater ^unofficial payment” was added. The Company concluded that the light moment to make such a final offer had come about a month ago, in view of a possible beneficial effect at Abu Dhabi and of the rather more promising nature of the Ras al Khaimah territory. A fortnight ago, the Shaikh verbally accepted Mr. Lermitte f s offer of Dubai terms plus an extra Rs.55*000, provided that there was nothing in the Exchange of Letters to scare him off. A few days later, however, he reverted to a demand for payments on the Qatar scale, and also wished to negotiate with the Political Agent over the Exchange of Letters, instead of merely accepting it. For these reasons Mr. Weightman did not proceed to Ras al Khaimah as he had intended to do, and Lermitte found that the hoped-for signature of the Concession could not be achieved. Lermitte f s latest reports indicate his conviction that the Trucial Shaikhs have now persuaded themselves and eachI 2 . i^. J. P. Gibson&gt; Esq ., 5th April, 1938. other that the Company is, in the long run, bound to offer them whatever they ask, and that H.M.G. has no intention of interven- ^ing. The following words form part of Lermitte T s cable dated ^**ril 2nd. 'Situation becoming daily increasingly difficult cu.d if signature delayed much longer Shaikhs will very definitely stick out for very much larger amount Politicals letter 'P.C.L. or nobody' very definitely not believed. We have instructed Lermitte to withdraw and return, at least temporarily, to Bahrain, and it is hard to see what other steps we can profitably take unless and until the atmosphere changes. It is no less hard to see what can change it, except the passage of time (with continued absence of competitors) and/or the intervention of H.M.G. At Ajman we recently suggested to the Shaikh that a concession should now be negotiated: he asked, however, to be left until last, and was unwilling to talk at present. As regards the terms which the Shaikhs are thus rejecting, they are by any possible standards uncommonly generous for territories of low oil promise, maximum physical difficulties and practically no inland control by the Concession-giving Rulers themselves. Such is the present position of the Company’s concession airing difficulties: its exploration difficulties,both in the Trucial Coast hinterland and in that of the Sultanate of Oman are, I believe, already well realised by yourselves and by the Political Resident.

Legal Adviser, at a late stage in the Debai negotiations, suggested a number of changes in the political agreement, but the F.O. agreed that it was not essential to include them. Some of these suggestions were not really applicable. Others, together with some suggestions by the Company, were agreed on between the F.O. and 1.0. and included in the Sharjah draft political agreement, and the authorities in the Gulf were instructed accordingly in June 1937, but, owing apparently to an oversight in the Gulf, the draft to which the Sheikh 1 s concurrence was obtained was in the old (Debai) form. The amendments were not considered essential, and with the concurrence of the F.O. we did not pursue the matter. In the present (Ras-al-Khaimah) case it is also the Debai agreement which has been shown to the Sheikh by the local representative of the Company. (The matter seems to have been left to the Coy. f s representative - perhaps inevitably.) Here too A the F.O. are to agree to the agreement being in the Debai form. The amendments which were agreed on in the Sharjah nfl.se /case are written in red ink on the copy of the Debai agreement flagged on the file. It will be seen that they are not very extensive in substance. He will take up with Sir T. Fowle on his arrival the question whether we should provide that any future agreements should incorporate these amendments, and possibly some other points of arrangement and drafting which may be improvements.

Debai and Sharjah, and we have now heard (see the Resident's telegram of 14th March at P.Z.1756/38) that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah is ready to sign an Agreement with the Company (a) if he is given an additional sum, which it is understood the Company are prepared to pay; and (b) if he approves the terms of the complementary^ Political Agreement between H.M. G. and the Company. 2. As regards (b) the Resident suggests that the Political Agreement should be in the same form as the Debai Agreement, the text of which is being shown to the Sheikh by the Company’s negotiator. When the draft of Sharjah Political Agreement was under consideration it was proposed to include certain amendments (mainly designed | If to improve drafting) suggested by the Foreign Office and a minor amendment suggested by the Company; but since it subsequently transpired that the text of the Agreement shown to, and accepted by, the Sheikh of Sharjah was that of the Debai Agreement it was decided, on the recommendation of the local Political Authorities, to conclude the Sharjah Agreement in the Debai form. 3. As regards Ras-al-Khaimah, the obvious thing would have been to include the amendments referred to in the preceding paragraph; but since the Sheikh is being shown the text of the Debai Agreement, it seems advisable, as the Resident suggests, to stick to the Debai form. It is understood that neither the Foreign Office nor the Company see any objection to this and subject to confirmation on their part, which is being sought^ in writing, it is proposed to conclude the Agreement forthwith As/As in the case of the other Political Agreements, it is proposed that the Agreement should be signed on behalf of H.M.G. by an Under Secretary of State at the India Office. i\v m E i 1977 7 939 gch/vh, (COPIES CIRCULATED) (41 groups•) D„S ,C Y P H E K OS TELEGRAM .

After discussion with the Foreign Office and the Company I suggest a minute seeking authority to proceed at once with a M Ras-al-Khaimah Political Agreement w in the same form as the Debai and Sharjah Agreements. If this proposal is approved it should be possible to conclude the formalities early next week (the Legal adviser has already been ssked to prepare the draft for signature) but in the meantime we ought perhaps to let the Resident know that we are proposing to adopt his suggestion. It will be noted that in the first place it is being left to Mr.Lermitte to show the draft Agreement to the Sheikh. This seems rather an odd procedure but it has probably been done to save time and it can perhaps be assumed that he has not also been given the job of explaining the draft notes. It is not enough for the Sheikh to accept the terms of the Political Agreement; he must also agree^as set out in the draft notes^to the overriding validity of the Political Agreement in any matter in which it may conflict with the commercial concession* and in view of the difficulties which have arisen in regard to Sharjah (see the Resident’s letter of the 16th February at P.Z.1241/38 - lower file) it seems desirable that the signature of the Commercial Agreement and the Exchange of Notes should take place simultaneously. This/This is no doubt what the Resident intends, but in order to avoid any chance of a slip up it is suggested that we should communicate with the Resident forthwith on the lines of the attached draft telegram.TELEPHONE : NATIONAL 3SS2 CODES : TELEGRAMS : INLAND : PETCONCESS, FINSQUARE, LONDON —FOREIGN : PETCONCESS, LONDON BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE BENTLEY’S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT LOMBARD PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED Dear Mr. Gibson, Your letter PZ.1756/3(3 of to-day ! s date.

I explained that the Company might require a landing ground there, and we wanted from him - the Shaikh - assistance **or a party to visit that area. The Company were of course prepared to pay for this facility. The Shaikh replied he did not see his way to give this assistance, i reminded him that last year he had arrang ed for a party of geologists to visit Baraimi, why could he not do so again this year ? He could give no adequate reason for his refusal, but persisted in it, and relapsed into a. sulky silence which continued until the end of his j visit. 4 A The only line, in ny opinion, to pursue with Abu Dhabi and the other Shaikhs is, as suggested in paragraph 6 of my Express letter under reference, to leave them alone. sd.

We told him, however, that we felt bound to add the warning that, for reasons which he would appreciate, it might not be possible for His Majesty’s Government to maintain indefinitely the exclusion of other oil companies from the Trucial Coast area, but that, while no definite assurance could be given, there was at present no possibility in sight that His Majesty’s Government would be obliged to modify their present attitude in this matter.

Addressed Resident dushire, copy by airmail to Government of India and Bahrein. Your telegram 8th June 531* Trucial Coast Oil. His Majesty’s Government agree generally. They suggest that attitude to be adopted to Sheikhs in case of necessity should be as follows. 2. P.C.L. are approved by His Majesty’s Government and were first in the field. They have already secured a concession from the Sheikh of Debai on terms satisfactory to his interests and are also offering satisfactory terms for other concessions. His Majesty’s Government do not wish to have more than one company operating on the Trucial Coast as this might lead to complications. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to approve agreements with P.C.L. but they are not prepared to consider permitting negotiations with any other company. 3. Above is of course on the assumption that you are satisfied that terms offered by P.C.L. in individual cases are in fact fair. 4. Your telegram 12th June 549* Company state emphatically that they are still most anxious to obtain concessions at earliest possible moment and that idea of securing extension of options is only a pis-aller. It is understood that since date of your telegram Shargah negotiations have been resumed and that diff erence between Sheikh and Company on points at issue is now quite small.Minute Paper, p. z. 3759/37 Mr. Walton . The interdepartmental discussion is at P.Z.1254/36 (big file below). It does not help very much. But the Foreign Office attitude is shown to some extent by Mr. Brenan^ letter of 27.11.36. at P.Z.8485/36 (in smaller, file). They want P.C.L. to get the concessions, but they want if possible to avoid raising any question of discrimination against an American Company on nationality grounds (i.e. they do not want a row with the U. S. Government). .Similarly, from our point of view, it is desirable (in the interests of smooth relations in Bahrain) not to treat ) the Standard Oil Company in any way which might j legitimately be called unfair. The position as I understand it is:- (1) We favour P.C.L. (2) P.C.L. are hung up in their negotiations because certain Shaikhs think they can do better with the Americans. ... ... (3) We have told Standard Oil. that we cannot approve . their entering the field at this stage (on the ground that P.C.L. have priority). They have withdrawn for the present but have stated that they are anxious to compete if and whenever an opportunity occurs for them to do so with H.M.G. 1 s consent. (4) P.C.L. have got a concession from the Shaikh of Dibai on reasonable terms (to all parties). (5) The terms-they offer to the other Shaikhs are similar. As regards the financial terms, Mr.4 yt • / ' - “* • * : T In these circumstances, v/hile it may he undesirable to say absolutely that P. C.L. are the only Company which H.M.G. will ever approve (since that might imply a discrimination against Standard Oil without £air cause) it might be quite reasonable for Sir T. Foy/le to say to e ach Shaikh.: - ’ (a) P.C.L. are approved by H.M.G. They were firpt. in the field and H,M.G. therefore cannot approve of their being supplanted by any other Company except with good cause. . . (b) P.C.L. have already secured a concession from the Shaikh of Dibai on terms satisfactory to his interests, and are offering similar satisfactory terms for other concessions. (c) H.M.G. do not wish, to have more than one Company operating on the Trucial Coast as this might lead to complications. , , . (d) In these circumstances and on the assnmption of course that the Resident is satisfied that the terms offered by P.C.L. are fair, H. M. G. are. prepared to approve concessions with P.C.L., but they are not prepared to consider pemitting negotiations with any other Company. This is in effect what Sir T.. Fowle proposes to do. But the actual formula is perhaps one that is not open to the same objections as his own rather blunt formula. If you agree we might put something of this sort to the Foreign Office (whom I have asked to be examining the papers meanwhile). . . , The Petroleum Department are in favour of exerting an^ % legitimate pressure in favour of P.C.L. So I think are undoubtedly the Admiralty (but M r . Seal is away to-day). (Sd.) M.J. Clauson 11/6 Mr. Clauson, I I agree. (Intll .) J.C.W. r Mr.Seal has since confirmed this M. J.C. 17/6y Immediate . p.z.3759/37 IV My dear Rendel, Will you kindly refer to Bushire telegram of the 8th, June, No. 531&gt; of which a copy was sent to you on the 9th June, P»Z.3759/37&gt; about Trucial Oil Negotiations. We have also had a visit from Longrigg on this matter. He says the Company are gravely disturbed about the present situation and feel that they are unlikely to be able to clinch matters with the Sheikh of Shargah and the other Sheikhs unless it is possible for Government to intervene on their behalf. Hdmes has apparently thrown in his hand and it is proposed that Longrigg should go out immediately to the G-ulf and try to get on with the negotiations. Generally speaking, we are inclined to agree with the proposal which Powle makes, and to suggest to him that the communication to the Sheikh should be put somewhat on the following lines: P.C.L. are approved by His Majesty 1 s Government and v/ere first in the field. They have already secured a concession from the Sheikh of Debai on terms satisfactory to his interests and are offering similarly satisfactory terms for other concessions. His Majesty’s Government do not wish to have more than one Company operating on the Trucial Coast as this might lead to complications. In these circumstances and on the assumption, of course, that the Resident is satisfied that the terms offered by P.C.L. are fair, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to approve aggreements with P.C.L., but they are not prepared to consider permitting negotiations with any other Company. G.W. Rendel Esq., C.M.G. , Foreign Office, S.W.l. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.l. 12th June, 1937 If/If you agree we would propose to telegraph to the Resident that he may have discretion to communicate as and when necessary with the various Sheikhs on these lines (which are of course very similar to those he suggests). Vfe would also suggest to Longrigg that he should go immediately to the Gulf and keep in touch with Powle, and, moreover, that he should he prepared to make such generous financial offers to the various Sheikhs as would justify Powle in regarding the offers as completely satisfactory from the point of view of the Sheikhs. Incidentally we gathered from Longrigg that the Company might he prepared somewhat to increase their present offers. We have considered whether we should he discriminating unfairly against the Standard Oil Company if we acted on these lines. Our view is that there v/ould not really he any unfair discrimination. It is obviously desirable that there should not he more than one Company on the Trucial Coast, and so long as the Sheikhs 1 interests are not sacrificed His Majesty*s G-overnment are entitled to bring pressure to hear upon them to secure that any concessions they may give should all he with the same Company. His Majesty*s Government can also claim that they are responsihile for seeing that P.C.L. (who were first in the field) receive a square deal from the Sheikhs, and to prevent the Sheikhs from using purely delaying tactics with a view to freeing themselves from the obligations to P.G.L. implicit in the options which they gave them.

Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) A. C. B. SYMON. !^.H.Longrigg, sq. City-Gate House, Finsbury Square n;ABU THABI, 11th February 1938. Dear Mr. Longrigg, I v/rote you a short report on the 3rd February and sent you a telegram by launch yesterday to the effect that the Ruler here and his brothers are still determined to get Ibn Saud conditions. H.Y.K. had no luck in his private talk v/ith Shakboot and I tackled the uncle, Khalifa, who promised to do his best, but to all appearances he has lost the power he once had. On the 5th I informed Shakboot that as he seemed determined to get something that the Company could not possibly give him, it would appear that I was wasting my time and his in talks which only had the one result. The same evening a messenger was sent to the brothers who were out hawking, and who had made plans to arrive in Abu Dhabi after the Sid, asking them to come in at once. They arrived on the 7th. I paid the usual visit to them in the afternoon and received their return visit on the morning of the 8th. As there were still a lot of people coming in from the surrounding villages to welcome the brothers T was unable to nave a private talk with them on the 9th, but I was promised a visit from the entire family on the 10th. The following members of the family turned up at 11 a.m I having previously attended the burza at 9 a.m. 1. Sheikh Shakboot bin Sultan, the Ruler. 2. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zaid, uncle of the Ruler. 3. Sheikh Heza’a bin Sultan, brother of the Ruler. 4. 5. 6 . 7. 8 . 9. Khalid ' ' ” ' ' ” Zaid ' ” ' ' Mohamed bin Khalifa, son of No. 2. Hamid bin Butti, his sister is mother of No. 1 Butti bin Khalfoun, his wife is sister of mother of No.1 Ahmed bin Hilal, powerful Sheikh of Bar»aimi.2 . 10. Sheikh Ahmed bin Khalaf, richest merchant in Atm Thahi and supposed to have a great influence over 1-5 also father of wife of No.6. 11. Sheikh Sa'id bin Shakboot, son of the Ruler, aged about 10. My party consisted of H.Y.K., the interpreter and myself. After the usual tinned fruits, sweets and coffee had been dispensed T gave a summing up of my talks with the Ruler and his uncle. The Ruler then confirmed that I had covered all the ground and added that he had already communicated this to his brothers. I then continued to point out the advantages of an oil concession which T had been given to understand they required. The Ruler replied that it was his wish to enter.into an agreement with the Company, but if Ibn Saud’s agreement was not produced, and the signature of Ibn Saud shown to them they were agreed not to negotiate. I then pointed out the vast difference between Saudi a Arabia and Abu Thabi and gave them very full reasons for the Company being unable to give them a similar concession. The Ruler agreed that what I had said was true but added that he had definitely made up his mind to agree to no other concession than a similar one to Ibn Saud. I then pointed out that his neighbours had both agreed with the Company and added that I hoped I would not see both Dubai, Sharjah and Qatar benefit whilst his country remained as it was and perhaps became even poorer through people leaving in order to obtain employment in those Sheikhdoms. His reply to this was that even if his country did become poorer he would never change his mind. After a little more talk I ended by asking him as a friend not to decide now but to think it over and to discuss it with his brothers and other members of his family. His/3. His reply to this was that he had very definitely made up his mind and that on my arrival he had bid me welcome and that on my departure he would bid me farewell. I again repeated that I would like him to discuss the business once more with his family. H.Y. K. then quoted a few pieces of poetry and added a fable or two and then begain to persuade the Ruler to reconsider his decision, pointing out that it was at the Ruler 1 s invitation that we were here, and that we had come at his express wish to discuss the oil agreement. The Ruler replied that H.Y. K. was considered an old friend and an old man whom they respected, but that nothing he could say would alter his decision. He added that H.Y.K. was considered as their father but if he continued to talk in the way he was doing he would be considered as an enemy! H.Y.K. thanked him for the kind words he had spoken and asked him to accept the advice of an old man and to talk over the business as Mr. Lermitte had asked him. The Ruler replied that as far as the money was concerned he would leave that entirely to Mr. Lermitte, but as far as conditions v/ere concerned he was not going to give up his rights and that he would consider anyone who persuaded him to do this to be a traitor as well as an enemy. H.Y. K. then reminded the Ruler that it vms at his invitation that he was there, and that he had been asked to be present in order to give his advice. The Ruler than flew into a rage, gripped his sword and started to call H.Y.K. all sorts of names, and in short lost his temper completely. Everyone was dumfounded and T looked around the assembly and saw a look of consternation and surprise on the face of everyone present. The/4. The words and phrases used were amazing and I have never heard such streams of invective. At times his speech was quite unintelligible. However, having got it off his chest he turned to me and asked me whether I had anything more to say. I replied that for the moment I had not, hut that he was to always remember that I was ready to help him in any way he wished and that I hoped he would talk over the business after leaving the meeting. He thanked me and conversation became once more normal. During the talks nobody spoke a v/ord even v/hen appealed to by either H.Y. K. or myself. Everyone seemed to be dumb, or frightened to say a single word. To-day is the Eid el Kebir and afte - ^ the usual Eid prayers I called on the Ruler who was outside the fort surrounded by thousands of bedu and sitting with all the members of his family. I was very well received and was given the place of honour between Shakboot and Khalifa and found that they had awaited my arrival before distributing the usual sweets coffee etc. I had a very friendly chat with them all and after half an hour I left. One of the things the Ruler said whilst he was somewhat angry was 'I will never accept these conditions unless you try by force to fight me (t’harbni bil gowa) and even then I will do my best to defeat you and if I am beaten I will then with the Ruler, his uncle Khalifa and Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10 mentioned on pages 1 - S. With the exception of the Ruler I had found that everyone wished to help and if what they say is true they did help. Both H.Y.K. and myself have used every possible argument and those who have helped have also done their best. Various bits of news were brought back to be excused by everybody. Previous to this meeting I had of course had talks me/© 22.2-' 5. me after sittings in the fort at night at wnich only relations were present, and the only possible deduction is that we have a very stubborn and ignorant young man to deal with who is very proud and likes to get his way in everything. Various factors may have influenced him and a few I give below. 1. He is very proud and will not be considered like the other Rulers on the Trucial Coast. 2. He is afraid that if anything happens in the future, exactly what he will not say, his bedu will blame him for not having signed an agreement similar to Saudi Arabia. 3. He is afraid that the Government might interfere owing to the very large number of slaves in Abu Thabi territory. 4. He still believes that the Company is a Government concern. 5. He is said to possess copies of newspapers purporting to give details of the agreements with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait Iraq etc. 6. Hussein Yateem v/rote to the Ruler some 8 or 9 months ago offering his services to arrange a concession with the California Arabian Standard Oil Co. of California, A1 Khobar. 7. Najib Khan, an employee of the above company and previously in the employ of Hussein Yateem visited the Ruler last year and proposed the same thing. 8. Having once made a decision he is said never to change. Presumably he knows this and is acting up to it. There are of course many other reasons of minor importance/6. importance and of course we have not to forget the chief obstructionist on the Coast. Apparently he visited here some time ago and stated that the Ruler should preserve his rights and stick to his demands, even though the company is an English one. On the 8th the Ruler told me he had received an invitation from the P. R. to attend the meeting of the Coastal Sheikhs at Sharjah on the 28th and wanted an excuse for not attending and thought it a good idea if he wrote saying that he would be unable to be present owing to the negotiations. The following dayhe told me that he had decided to accept and was leaving here on the 16th. Since beginning this page I have received the return visit of the Ruler, his uncle Khalifa and all the members of the family. They arrived at 8.30 p.m. and stayed till 10. They were all in a very good mood and the visit passed off exceptionally well, and despite the fact that they had been feasting all day they did good justice to the fare I provided. If I do not find any signs of improvement Ipropose to leave here a day or so before Shakboot leaves for Sharjah, and I will then have the opportunity of seeing the P.R. Tomorrov; and the day after are also considered as Eid days here and there will not be much opportunity for business but I hope to be able to get some news of what was said amongst the family after our rather tempestuous meeting of yesterday. It has been blowing a gale all the afternoon and it is really bad at the moment, the air is full of dust and what are supposed to be windows are absolutely useless. Having discussed some of the reasons why the Ruler does not want to accept our draft agreement we must now consider what/22-4-' 7. what can be done and whether we can offer him an agreement in a different form. 1. Is there anything objectionable in the Saudi Arabia agreement which would prevent its being offered here. It is of course understood that there are manythings which would not be applicable to this territory. 2. Does the Company want to offer any other agreement, or does it want the Coast to have only one form of agreement. 5. Would it create discontent with the Rulers who had already signed if another agreement is offered. 4. There seems to be no way out at the moment except to change the form of agreement in order to appease his pride. Throughout the negotiations I have repeatedly said that the Company cannot bring the Saudi Arabian agreement. I, of course, am not in a position to say whether the company can afford to play a waiting game, but it is my considered opinion that the Ruler will not change. On my previous visit the Ruler's brother Meza 1 a did most of the talking but this time he has not opened his mouth. It is impossible and even dangerous to offer the brothers sometning in order to bring them over, although perhaps they themselves would like it. The Ruler and his three brothers all live together in the fort and any approach made v/ould at once be known. The Ruler stated during his tirade that if any of his brothers took a present he would consider him as a traitor and deal with him accordingly. I do not think that I am being bluffed, although the Bedu/Bedu are adepts at that. The family are typical Bedu and wea-r* their hair in long plaits and not one 8 . of them even wears sandals. I will continue here until I see that signs are really 'being made for the Ruler to leare en route for the meeting at Sharjah. The usual letter, F.C.L. or nobody, has been received and the Ruler replied that if he could not agree with that company he would be free to negotiate with any other he pleased. This report I am afraid is very pessimistic but you can be assured that we have done everything possible to get the Ruler to agree and have always met with the same reply. On my last visit the Ruler insisted on the Kov/ait agreement but has presumably changed after realising that the Kowait company is not a part of P.C.L. I have tried to mention Muscat but the Ruler refuses to hear anything said about that territory, so it has been impossible to make any headway on that line. Qatar he classes with the other Rulers who have already signed. Although he has been told by some Bedu that the Company is drilling in Qatar it has not altered his decision in any way. Financially this territory is very poor, the taxes are less than in any other and the quantity of t^ade is very small indeed, practically the whole of the revenue is from pearling and the rake off on that is less than in the other Sheikhdoms on the coast. Please communicate with me as usual, I shall try to have another go at Ras A1 Khaimah if I leave here and so will be nearer to oharjah. I have received an invitation to/9. to visit the Ruler of Ras A1 Khaimah and this might mean that he has reconsidered his decision. Yours sincerely, Sgd. A.P. Lermitte. F.S. Food and water are a real problem here. Vegetables, fruit and meat are unobtainable and I have to bring all from Dubai. Water is undrinkable and the amount of undiluted sea water T have had to drink under the guise of coffee is amazing. I bring all water rrom Dubai and am never without visitors who call for a real cup of coffee followed by a glass of Bombay water. Fish is only obtainable when the weather is fine. We have been absolutely cut off for several days owing to bad weather. The ford cannot be crossed even by camels who have been held up for several days. Luckily I brought big stocks with me and have a flock of sheep and numerous chickens and ample water.I ^7 ^ T' ^ (&amp;1) 'A?

Do you consider that there would be any advantage in Longrigg coming out at this stage?Mr. Longrigg called today by appointment and saw Mr. Gibson and Mr. Symon. He said that his Company were becoming disturbed at the continued failure to clinch matters with the Trucial Sheikhs and in particular about the apparent deadlock with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi owing to the latter's exorbitant demands. He said that from the beginning the Sheikh had refused to discuss matters on the basis of the draft Agreement suggested by the Company and that the Sheikh had now demanded terms similar to those granted to Ibn Saud in respect of their Hedjaz concession. The Company had a UaxL suspicion that in making these demands the Sheikh ahd been influenced by advice received from Ibn Saud. They considered that these demands were quite unwarrantable and that so far as they were concerned there was no hope of reaching a settlement unless the Sheikh was prepared to alter his views. He added that the Company had already offered to the Sheikh twice the amount which they had paid to the Sheikh of Debai. Mr. Longrigg then went on to say that the Company were apprehensive lest their failure to come to terms v/ith the Trucial Sheikhs within a reasonable time might result in/$8 33/31 in their losing theii present privileged position and that others might he allowed to enter the i'ield. The Company had now obtained concessions in respect of Qatar and Muscat and they were more than ever anxious to avoid any part of the intervening territory falling into other hands. Mr. Longrigg said that he understood that a communication had already been addressed to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on the lines indicated in our telegram ho. 1674 of the 17th June 1937 and he asked whether anything further could be done to assist the Company to come to terms with the remaining Trucial Sheikhs. As an indication of the Sheikh’s present attitude Mr. Longrigg said that he understood that the Sheikh had positively refused any assistance in the matter of preparing a landing ground at Baraimi. Mr. Longrigg said that he would be willing to go out to the Gulf at once^with fairly wide pov/ers / if it v/as considered that there was any prospect of reaching a reasonable settlement with Abu Dhabi. ix6 would at the same time attempt to clinch matters with the Sheikh of Has al Khaimah who, the Company think, might be persuaded to sign an/15 ^ .2^, Friday at 12 noon will 'be quite convenient for the interview with Mr* Longrigg* so far as he is concerned.

In one of these letters I have been given to understand that Hajji Abdullah said that his letters appeal* to have been intercepted and thus he was afraid to mention anything, but that he intended to come to the Trucial Coast after the month of Ramadhan and then arrange things wit i the Shaikh. One of t iese letters was received through Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanu, but I have net yet been able to dis cover through whom the others were received. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, wrote a letter which he sent through Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanu to Hajji Abdullah in which he welcomed his visit and asked him to let him know the whereabouts of Major Holmes. In one of his letters Hajji Abdul*ah made an indirect in vitation to the Shaiih of Kas al Khaimah by saying that should the Shaikh intend to visit Basrah or go on pilgri mage via ^raq he should put up with him (Abdullah). 3* Abu Dhabi .

Delivery.■ The Standard Oil Company of California learn with interest and pleasure, your desire to negotiate with than for an Oil Concession within your territory, and they would like to consider this matter further. There would, however, appear to he a serious diffi culty in the way of their doing anything now because they observe that you have entered into an Agreement with the British Government not to grant any Con cessions for oil within your territory except with the permission of the British Government. Your message to us does not say whether you have such permission, and surmising that their infomation is correct, the Standard Oil Company of California ask that you obtain such permission and communicate with them again when you have received it. * ~^FIDENTIAL. PERSIAN GULP OIL - TRUCIAL COAST Mr. Ballantyne called this afternoon by appointment on behalf of The Standard Oil Company of California. Sir Trenchard Fowle was present throughout the interview. Standard Oil Company had made no further approach to the Trucial Sheikhs concerned. A few weeks ago, however, the Sheikh of the Ras-al-Khaimah sent a messenger to the Standard Oil Company’s local representative with an oral message to the effect that he, (the Sheikh) was no longer bound to any other Company (his Option with P.C.L. expired on 31st July) and that he was free to enter into negotiations with the Standard Oil. Mr. Ballantyne wished to know whether, in such circumstances, there would be any objection to his Principals now dealing with this Sheikh. of the Option, P.C.L. was still interested and that His Majesty’s Government could not approve of a competitor entering the field. Mr. Ballantyne expressed himself as satisfied with this answer and undertook to inform Standard Oil accordingly, who would in turn tell the Sheikh's messenger that the Company regretted that they were not interested. He was informed that notwithstanding the expiry India Office ^th October, 1937 CO* V GENT TOMinute Paper. Department. dated 12th October, P. Z. 6341/37. Trucial Coast Oil. A meeting with representatives of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. , (Mr. Longrigg and Mr. Lewison) was held in the India Office on the 19th October on the subject of oil concessions in the Trucial Coast area and Muscat. Sir Trenchard Powle was present. Mr. Walton referred to a distinction made in a recent x letter to the Company, between the de jure and the de facto control of the Trucial Coast Sheikhs over their hinterland. He said these terms had been used as a convenient working description, but that it was not intended to give them the strict meaning they would bear in international law, and it was therefore desired that they should not be repeated in future correspondence. The term ' de jure ' was objectionable in this connexion because (a) it might lead to a claim by the Sheikhs to our protection on the landward side of their territory, whereas we have only undertaken to protect them on the seaward side; and (b) it might lead to expectations from the side of the League of Nations that international conventions (Slavery etc. j should be observed throughout what is stated to be the de jure territory of Sheikhs under our protection. Mr. Longrigg expressed appreciation of the position. Mr. Walton then told Mr. Longrigg that we had just been informed by telegram that the Sultan of Muscat would prefer to see him in Delhi, and further that the Sultan objected strongly to any idea of Mr. Longrigg meeting the Imam. This latter piece of news did not surprise Mr. Longrigg who said that it was clearly now for him to ask the Sultan to deal with the Imam as he thought best in connexion with the Company’s concession. (As/ I2. (As regards the Muscat concession Mr. longrigg said that all preliminary steps had been completed and all that remained was the formal completion of the documents by the Sultan and the Company). The Company’s operations in the Trucial Coast area were then discussed. Sir Trenchard Pov/le made the suggestion that, if an aerial survey of the ground would be of value to the Company, it might be possible to get the R.A.F. to undertake the work on payment. Mr. Longrigg said the value of the survey to the Company depended altogether on the way it was carried out; if made at the proper height (about 3,000 feet;, systematically, and as desired by the Company’s geologis who ought to accompany the flight, it would have considerable value, at any rate of a negative kind in showing in what ground the Company would not have any interest. It was decided that Sir Trenchard Fowle and Mr. Longrigg should visit the Air Ministry for a preliminary discussion of the suggestion. tP.Z. 6341/37.

Tne question of a concession was generally das cussed* The Snaikh would have nothing to do with what he called tne 'Holmes Agree ment'* This is the printed Abu Dhabi Draft Concession 1957. After considerable argument, the Shaikh stated that he would agree to a Concession on the lines of the Kuwait Concession and nothing else* Mr. Lermitte explained the Draft Concession care fully but was unable to make any appreciable impression and returned to Dubai having informed the Shaikh that he would be available if wanted for further discussion* The Shaikh proposed sending for his uncle Shaikh Khalifah who is at present at Buraimi. ATMAN* The Shaikh preferred not to discuss a Concession until the expiration of the option period which expired on the 22nd January 1938. TJMM-AL-aAIWAlN* Mr* Lermitte paid the Shaikh a courtesy call and no discussiod took place. Mr. Lermitte is proposing to interview the Shaikh again in the near future* ras-al-khaimah . Mr* Lermitte has been negotiating with this Shaikh for five or s ix days* MT* Lermitte had succeeded in reducing the Shaikh* s large demands to a form which would probably have been acceptable to his company by tne evening of September 8th* The only major question /- 2 - Z&lt;z\ .g( * quedtion remaining was the financial clause# Tne following day the Shaikh’s Secretary informed Mr# Lermitte tnat tne Snaikh had crianged his mind and was again insisting on the majority of his original demands. Mr. Lermitte then came to Sharjah to see me but is proposing to return t o Ras-al-Khaimah and again tackle the Shaikh. 2. I have discussed the situation generally with Mr.lermitte and he has given me the Shaikh of Ras-al-Ktiaimah* s terms to read through. As an indication of the type of demand that he is making it will suffice if I state that he asks for a 20 per cent, interest in the Company, for one thousand rifles and one hundred thousand rounds of S.A.A#* f or the establisnment of a school, for the appointment of his representative at a salary of -£.500 gold (this amount was not written but was verbally communicated to Mr. Lermitte) and he claimed tne right to try all foreigners in the local courts. As I have pointed out before, the Snaikn is not absolutely normal, and is influenced by a self-seeking .Najdi Qadhi who has compiled these demands from all the Concessions that have been concluded in this part of the world of which the Shaikh has obtained copies. I hope that Mr. Lermitte can bring the Shaikh to reason but I am very doubtful and expect that we shall ourselves be forced to take action to persuade the Shaikh to see reason if we are to ensure that the Concession goes to a British company within a reasonable period of time# X X X x *xxxx X X 4. The Shaikh of Ajman’s area is so small tnat he is not considered to be of primary importance. I nave no comment to make ln tJle case of 'toa-al-qaiwai n. In regard to Abu Dhabi I have told Mr. Lermitte that I consider that Shaikh Khalifan bin 2aid nas considerable influence in Abu Dhabi and that he would / Iwould do well to take any opportuntty tnat offered to discuss the question with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan in the presence of Shaikh Khalifah bin Zaid even though it be necessary to go to Buraiml to do so.&lt;S!i&gt; 224-- P.

As the Company are still conyirced, despite the considerations put forward in ray letter of the 17th September, that M.Pomeyrol is the best man available to them in ail the circumstances, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to accord their permission for his employment. As a matter of principle, we should be glad to have a formal assurance from the Company that the employment of this non-British subject is in their opinion necessary for the efficient carrying out of their undertakings on the Prucial Coast. But perhaps it is hardly necessary for you to send this assurance unless and until it is actually decided that the party is going to operate on the Prucial Coast. S.

Monsieur Pomeyrol would, according to our plans, be on the Trucial Coast as assistant to Mr. T.F. Williamson and I cannot feel that his presence should appreciably affect the sentiments of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, even if the latter were aware that Pomeyrol was not an Englishman. If he conceived serious doubts as to the British character of P.C.L., they could, I imagine, be dispelled without difficulty by the Political Authorities and ourselves. Even if Abu Dhabi continued to have his suspicions, even this might not be quite fatal, since non-British concerns (in the person of our Californian friends) do not seem in the past to have been considered by the Trucial Shaikhs as altogether impossible candidates for their favours 1 At the moment of writing it is not quite certain that we shall think it worth while sending a geological party on to the Trucial Coast this year at all, their right of access to the more interesting areas ( which are on the side remotest from Abu Dhabi) being doubtful: but if we do, we should definitely like T.F. Williamson and Pomeyrol to form the party - unless, of course, you forbid it. Yours sincerely. M.J. Clauson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall. S.W.lP.S.6133/37 DIMA OtMOS. ?&amp;Mt- 1 V/HXnSALL t S.

Rene Pomeyrol, a French geologist, by Petroleum Concessions Limited, we have asked Jedda whether they have any information about him, but they know nothing beyond what is in paragraph 370 of the Jedda Report for November 1936. I understand from Symon that no further enquiries on our part are necessary. 2. We have no objection to the proposal that M. Pomeyrol should be employed in view of the fact that no suitable British geologist is apparently available. M.J. Clauson, Eso. fIn reply to your letter of 2nd September to Starling about the proposal of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, to send M. Ren 6 Pomeyrol - a French geologist - to the Trucial coast to assist Mr, T. F m Williamson, who will be in charge of the party, I write to say that, for our part, we have no objection to raise to the proposal. The enquiries which we have been able to make confirm the accuracy of the Company’s statement in the last paragraph of their letter of 24th August that they have no British geologist of equal capacity available at the present time, I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner at the Foreign Office.

Monsieur Pomeyrol worked for us last season in Saudi Arabia, and enjoys the confidence of the Company from all points of view. We therefore ask you to give us your necessary agreement to his employment in this capacity on the Trucial Coast. Monsieur Pomeyrol was born in 1904, studied and obtained his diploma from the Ecole Normale des Combustibles of Strasbourg, has done his military service, and has had experience in the Field in Chile, Syria and France. It is hoped that you will find no difficulty in according us the permission asked.

Powle, There are two points on this. 1) the question of P.G.L. exploring in the Trucial Hinterland. On this you will see it is suggested that there should he a talk with the Company - a preliminary discussion with Mr. Walton would of course he desirable. (We have not yet had a reply to our telegram of 17th September 1937 just below.) % 2) in para. 3 of your Express Letter of 12th August (P.Z.5753/37) - received 31st August - you made a suggestion in regard to the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah. I am sorry to say that this has got overlaid by the correspondence on (1) above. But in the meanwhile I have heard from P.C.L. that they were receiving better reports of the conversations with this Sheikh, who had withdrawn his more preposterous demands. If in fact P.C.L. are getting on in negotiations with him, it may be best to leave him alone for the present. In any case, it might possibly be a good thing to get an up-to-date report on his attitude (which seems to be singularly volatile) through the Acting Resident before taking a decision. What do you think? A further and separate point on this is that the Sheikh cannot grant an effective concession to California without His Majesty’s Government consent, which His Majesty’s Government do not intend to give. His Majesty’s Government have the last word and it may be best to let this Sheikh stew in his own juice. He seems/ r' 6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 9.37 10P— seems to be incurably ill-mannered ! (Sd.) M.J. Clauson 20.9.37. Mr. Glauson, Re (1) I do not think we can do anything until a reply has been received to your telegram of 19 th Sept. (P.Z.5803) (2) In view of fact that the Standard Oil are committed to H.M.G. not to open negotiations with Trucial Coast Shaikhs (vide para.2 of your Note to Mr. Walton of 3rd August P.Z.5070) I think the position is safe enough vis-a-vis Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah, and as considerable time has elapsed since the Shaikh wrote his obstreperous letter, I agree that the best thing to do is to leave him alone.

(2) Shaikh has sent a reply to this letter in the course of which he says 'If an agreement is arrived at and the wishes of both parties have been fulfilled this will be exactly what I want in acting in accordance with the wishes of Mis Majestv*s Government. if no agreement is arrived at 1 would be compelled to negotiate with another company which fulfills my demands. In vie./ oi the ^act that this would be in my interests His Maj esty's Government .naturally would not dislike it but they like xor uneir ^riends everything which is in the interest of the country from the commercial point of view.' (3) in other words the situation is that His Majesty's Government have categorically informed the Shaikh that they are not prepared to consider his negotiating with any other Company except/exaept petroleum Oonceasions United, and the Shaikh has replied that if ne^otiations-.vith that uompany fail he will negotiate with any other Goiapany which fulfills his conditions. ihe Shaikh seems to he in an obstreperous frame of mind, vide my Express letter Ho. 1561 dated 12th August 1937 on the subject of Kalb a. I suggest that I be authorised to reply to the ohaikh that on one recent case already, i.e. Kalba, he had disregarded the orders of His Majesty's Government and had been leniently treated. If however he now disregards the orders of His Maj esty's Government in this case His Majesty's Government will take a very serious view of his disobedience. (4) in this connection please see paragraph 5 of my telegram Mo. 1/109 of 22nd July 1937. If His Majesty* s Govern ment inform the Standard Oil Company as suggested, presumably the latter will not negotiate either with Has al Kiiaimah o~ any other Shaikh on the Trucial Coast, and the question of such negotiations will not arise. l would be grateful for a reply by telegram to the proposal in paragraph 8 (3) above. 3d.

I realise the position to be that, whereas Sir Trenchard Fowle had previously suggested postponement of further P.C.L. negotiations on the Trucial Coast until October, he now has, and you have, no objection to those negotiations being carried on forthwith, if the Company so desire. It appears from correspondence received a day or two' ago from our Bahrain Management, that Captain Hickinbotham has been approached recently by the Shaikhs of Umm-ai-Cuwain and Ajman on the lines that they are 'willing to negotiate'. He has passed this information on to Mr. Lermitte, and has asked the latter to tell him what are our maximum terms for those Shaikhdoms and for Ras-al-Khaimah. It seems, therefore, that the Political Agent, Bahrain, visualises the immediate continuance of negotiations. If the local atmosphere appears suitable, it is likely that we, on our side, shall agree to this. We will, of course, as usual, keep you fully informed. Yours sincerely. J.C.

Please see paragraph 5 of Sir Trenchard Fowle s telegram of 22nd July (P.Z.4817/37) a copy of which is attached. The correspondence with Mr. Ballantyne, in his capacity as agent for the Standard Oil Company of California, is flagged A,B,C and D in the file below. I am inclined myself to think that it is unnecessary to make any further communication to the Company at this stage. Apart from the written correspondence, I have made it clear to Mr. Ballantyne in conversation that it was impossible to say what H.M.G.'s attitude might be in the event of the Options expiring without P.C.L.’s having obtained concessions, and I equally made it clear that any negotiations with the Sheikh should be initiated through H.M.G.'s local representative. on 2. It would, of course, be unwise to rely/anything except the written correspondence, but even on this alone I feel that we are safeguarded. 3.

In that paragraph the Resident suggests that the Standard Oil Company should be informed as soon as possible of the communications which have been made to the Sheikhs of Sharjah, Ras-al-Khaimah and Umm-al-Qaiwain. These communications were, of course, to the effect that H.M.G. are prepared to approve concessions granted to P.C.L. but are not prepared to consider permitting the Sheikhs to negotiate with any other Company. 2. We have looked again at the correspondence with Mr. Ballantyne, of which copies were sent to the Foreign Office on the 17th December, 1936, (P.Z.8679/36), the 28th December, 1936, (P.Z.9080/36), the 2nd January, 1937, (P.Z.9080/36), and the 31st March, 1937, *• (P. Z. 1871/37). The last of these papers is Mr. Ballantyne’s letter of 19th March in which he confirmed that the Standard Oil Company ’hre interested, and will continue to be interested, in negotiating for oil concessions within the Trucial Oman coast area, if and whenever an opportunity occurs for them/r them to do so with the consent of H.M.’s Government”. 3. In the light of the correspondence and, in particular, of this paragraph in Mr. Ballantyne*s letter of 19th March we are inclined to think that it is unnecessary to say any more at this stag to the Standard Oil Company, despite the fact that the option at Ras-al-Khaimah has now expired. It would clearly he qiite improper for the Company to s*te^ negotiating with any of the Rulers without informing H.M.G. of their intention, and if they were to do so we should he in a very strong position # On the other hand, to make a further communication to them at this stage, without any particular peg to hang it on to, might merely cause unnecessary irritation 4.

My dear Hendel^ Will you kindly reier to Bushire telegram of the 8th June^ No.531, of v/hich a copy was sent to you on the 9th June, P.Z.3759/37, about Trucial Oil Negotiations. He says the Company are gravely disturbed about the present situation and feel that they are unlikely to be able to clinch matters with the Sheikh of Shargah and rhe other Sheikhs unless it is possible for Government to intervene on their behalf. Holmes has apparently thrown in his hand and it is proposed that Longrigg should go out immediately to the Gulf and try to get on with the negotiations. Generally speaking, we are inclined to agree with the proposal which Powle makes, and to suggest to him that the communication to the Sheikhs should be put somewhat on the foilowing lines. He have also had a visit from Longrigg on this matter G. W. Bendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Olfice, S.W.l Petroleum/petroleum Concessions Limited are approved by His Majesty's Government and were first in the field. They have already secured a concession from the Sheikh of Debai on terms satisfactory to his interests and are offering similarly satisfactory terms for other concessions. His Majesty's Government do not wish to have more than one Company operating on the Trucial coast as this might lead to complications. in these circumstances and on the assumption, of course, that the Resident is satisfied that the terms offered by Petroleum Concessions Limited are fair. His Majesty's Government are prepared to approve agreements with Petroleum Concessions Limited, but they are not prepared to consider permitting- negotiations with any other Company. If you agree we would propose to telegraph to the Resident that he may have discretion to communicate as and when necessary with the various Sheikhs on these lines (which are of course very similar to those he suggests). We would also suggest to Longrigg that he should to o immediately go the Gulf and keep in touch with Fowle, and, moreover, that he should be prepared to make such generous/3. generous financial offers to the various Sheikhs as would justify Fowle in regarding the offers as completely satisfactory from the point of view of the Sheikhs. Incidentally we gathered from Longrigg that the company might be prepared somewhat to increase their present offers. We have considered whether we should be discriminating unfairly against the Standard Oil Company if v/e acted on these lines. Our view is that there would not really by any unfai r discrimination. It is obvicusly desirable that there should not. be more than one Company on the Trucial Coast, and so long as the Sheikhs* interests are not sacrificed His Majesty's Government are entitled to bring pressure to bear upon them to secure that any concessions they may give should all be with the same Company. His Majesty's Government can also claim that they are responsible for seeing that Petroleum Concessions Limited (who were first in the field) receive a square deal irom the Sheikhs, and to prevent the Sheikhs from using purely delaying tactics with a view to freeing themselves from the obligations to Petroleum Concessions Limited implicit in the options which they gave them. 1 /I'll.

I confirm the oral assurance I have already given to you on behalf of the Standard Oil Company of California that they will, so far as possible, give effect to the desires of His :,ajesty f s Government as expressed in your said two letters. The Company have intimated to the India Office their desire to be permitted to communicate the foregoing decision to the several Sheikhs concerned. I communicated to the Company the deci sion of the India Office in this regard, which was to the effect that whilst there was no objection to the suggestion made, in principle, the India Office definitely did not like the idea of an Onissary of tiie Company going down to see the Sheikhs, but it thought a letter 3 would meet the case, and, furthermore, that the letter should be J * shewn in draft to K.K.Political igent at Bahrein, and that the best plan would be to send the letters to the Political hgent at Bahrein for transmission to the Sheikhs. So \10 '9v r \r A-2- I have to confirm that after further consideration the Company feel that this method of communication might entail lengthy discussions with consequential delay, and therefore the Company withdraw their request to make such communications to the Trucial Oman Sheikhs. Hay I confirm here that the Company are interested, and will continue to he interested, in negotiating for oil concessions within the Crucial Oman Coast area, if and whenever an opportunity occurs for them to do so with the consent of K.

With regard to your oral communication to me on the 11th March that according to a telegram then recently received hy the India Office from Colonel Fowle, information had reached Colonel Fowle which suggested that Arab agents of the Corrpany were endeavour ing to open negotiations with a certain Trucial Coast Ruler, I confirm my reply to you that the Company know nothing of the matter referred to hy Colonel Fowle.

Poor old Haji Williamson, who is himself apt to be tiresome at times, complained about the geologists* hurry - thqy complained of the length of his prayers - the geologists complained of Holmes - Holmes complained of Ha j i poking his nose into affairs that had nothing to do with him and of the geologists lack of tact (and incidentally misusing his furniture in his Bahrain house*.) - all united in complaining vaguely of their Company sending them out into the blue without adequate instructions ! *.

He said that he was not yet in a position to reply, but was awaiting a cable from San Francisco. He appreciated that if an early reply was not forthcoming H.M.G, would have to consider what, if anything, they themselves should say to the Sheikhs. I also made a statement to him in the terms of Bushire telegram of the 5th March (P. Z. 1528/37) to the effect that information had reached H.M.G. which suggested that the Company’s local Arab Agents were endeavouring, presumably w r ithout the Company’s knowledge, to open negotiations with certain Trucial Coast Pulers.

Z.8679/36) about the interest taken by Standard Oil of California in the Trucial Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, and to your oral request for an elucidation of the phrase ’’the Trucial Sheikhs” in para. 3 of that letter ? I find that in actual fact options have been granted by five of the Sheikhs, namely those of Ras-al-Khaimah, Sharjah, Debai^ Abu Dhabi and Ajman. The implication in my letter that all the Trucial Sheikhs had granted options was not, therefore, strictly accurate. But the five Sheikhdoms mentioned cover practically the whole area of Trucial Oman, and I am desired to confim that H.M.G. definitely regard P.C.L. as having priority in the whole area, so that in the circumstances, as you will appreciate, they could hardly approve of a competitor approaching any of the Trucial Sheikhs. H.M.G. accordingly hope that your Company will not send a representative to the Trucial Coast or enter into conversations with any of these Sheikhs on oil matters. In this connexion we have received a report that a BritishDraft Paper. Department. Indian employee of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company named Ajib Khan recently visited the Trucial Coast without obtaining a visa . Would you be so kind as to ask the Company to give instructions that no one should visit the Trucial Coast without first obtaining a visa from the Political Agent at Bahrein ?

Certainly no option speaking in a rather loose way of the Trucial Sheikhdoms in cur consideration of this matter, and we had rather overlooked this small Sheikhdom; the other five from which options have been secured cover practically the whole Trucial Coast area. It is clear that what the Standard Oil Company have / / Trucial Coast, I enclose a copy of a note of the / / conversation with Mr.Ballantyne this afternoon. I find has been granted by this Sheikh.

Ql * ' 6 — —in mind is that they might secure some sort of agreement from the Sheikh of T Jmm-al-Q ) aiwain (on the general ground that presumably as P.C.L. have not got an option from him he is not forbidden ground), and that this might be of use to them not necessarily for developnent purposes but perhaps as a pawn in any negotiations they might have with P.C.L., e.g. in regard to markets. I think the Company are clearly entitled to have an elucidation of the phrase 'Trucial Sheikhs', and the best thing might be to say that no option exists in respect of Umm - a 1 - C : a i w a i n but that His Majesty’s Government’s general attitude is not affected by this. The Sheikhdom of Umm-al-Qaiwain is a very small portion of the Trucial area and at this stage they regard Trucial Oman as one area for oil purposes. They would in any case wish to make sure in the first place that their commitment to Petroleum. Concessions Limited in regard to this particular Sheikhdom had ceased to exist before considering whether the Sheikhdom could be separated for this purpose from the other Sheikhdoms, and whether another Company could be regarded/J 385'' 3. regarded as a 'person appointed 'by the British G-overnment' for the purpose of negotiating any agreement with the Sheikh. Yours sincerely, Lr* /,uX -— Confidential P3R3IAI? O'JJjV OIL - TRUCIAL COAST. Mr.Ballantyne called this afternoon with reference to my letter to him dated the 16th December, ho.P.Z.8679/36, in which it was intimated that His Majesty’s Government could not at this stage approve of any Company approaching the Trucial Sheikhs for oil concessions other than Petroleum Concessions Limited. Mr.Ballantyne’s objective was to ask (a) for a further elucidation of the phrase in paragraph 3 ’’the Trucial Sheikhs'; and (b ) whether it was possible for His Majesty’s Government to give any indication as to the future, e.g. as to the length of the options and the position if and when these options expired. s regards (b), I said that I thought H.M.G. would not be willing to say anything at this stage. The letter explained clearly that Petroleum Concessions -Ltd. held the field at present, and H.M.G. could hardly be expected to say now what the position would be if and when they ceased to do so. Mr.Ballantyne did not press this question at all. As regards (a), I said that I thought it was quite clear what /2 . what the phrase 'the Trucial Sheikhs” means, and the phrase 'in this area' must obviously mean the Trucial coe^st as a whole. Mr.Ballantyne said he would like to be sure, in order that there might not be any misunderstandings later on, that the reference in paragraph 3 to the exclusive options by virtue of which P.C.L. are regarded as having priority covered all the Trucial Sheikhs. I gathered from him that the Company had the impression that all the Trucial Sheikhs had not given options. I said that I was not perfectly sure of the position but would look into the papers and let him have an answer to his request for an elucidation of the phrase 'the Trucial Sheikhs'.

OLAUSON% n (»&gt; ^ $i/i' * 0 y^&gt;- ^ ^ ^irJLr.J.tew a iA,, ^o-r^, On various dates between 1st August, 193&amp;, and 23rd January, 1936, the five Trucial Sheikhs gave exclusive options to the A.I.Q.C.; the periods of the options are three years in the case of Abu Dhabi and two years in the other cases, and one of the terms is that during these periods the Sheikh will not receive or consider an offer from any other quarter. Jv These options we have approved, knowing of course that the A.I.O.C. intended to transfer their rights to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. (= Iraq Petroleum Coy.), since (under the 'Red Line Agreement”) they could not operate concessions in this area except in conjunction with their partners m the I.P.C. We have been in (extremely complicated and detailed) negotiations with P.C.L. since 24th October, 1935, regarding applications for concessions for the Trucial Sheikhdoms, the unallotted area of Bahrein and Muscat, and an option on the Koweit neutral zone. Negotiations with the Rulers on the basis of draft concessions which were submitted were approved. Major Holmes has been in the Gulf this summer negotiating the concessions at Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast. The Trucial Sheikhs have been informed by the A.I.O.C. and us that the options are transferred to P.C.L. (the A.I.O.C. having the right, of course, in favour of their own nominee, to release the Sheikh from his exclusive undertaking). Some of the Sheikhs have made some difficulties about the transfer of the options, and efforts are being made to dissipate any misunderstanding. Major Holmes has concluded negotiations with the Sheikh of Debai, and approval of this concession (subject to some minor alterations) and of the '‘Political Agreement' and accompanying document s/documents has just been given. The Bahrein Petroleum Coy. (a subsidiary of the California Coy.) has also been negotiating for the unallotted area of Bahrein. We had no objection to this, of course, as they are already in the island. The Sheikh asked our opinion on the terms offered by the tv/o competitors, and the Petroleum )ept. made a comparison of the terms which we passed on to him. He is understood at present to be considering a plan of giving the area on the main island to the B.P.C., and Hawar, and perhaps also other islands, to P.C.L. The Sultan of 1. us cat has been absent in Dhofar, so that - ajor Holmes was unable to begin negotiations with him on the basis of the draft concession, but we informed the Coy. that in the meantime the P.A. would explain the position generally to the Sultan. Owing to the indeterminate status of the Koweit neutral zone it was decided that P.C.L. could only apply for an option. x yu, ;. We have been in constant contact with P.C.L. in regard to sr, . .. - A S ’I &gt; !' ° ^c. Depts. concerned, and Major Holmes has no doubt been acting in close touch with the local political authorities. gaps and thus keep out a completely foreign company - especially from the Trucial Coast, the Koweit neutral zone and Muscat. There are, of course, several reasons making this desirable from the point of view of British interests. It would, I think, be unfortunate if another competitor came in at this stage. The Trucial Sheikhdoms would be sterilised for the remaining period of the options, and the these negotiations, and also with the three or four other As no more British company was in sight, we were definitely in favour of P.C.L. ! s applications, in order to fill Rulers/Rulers would lose financially. The Sheikhs would be confused and upset. P.C.L. would inevitably get the impression that we were playing fast and loose with them, and we should no doubt get strong representations from the British interests therein (A.I.O.C. and Shell). Moreover, we want to get these concessions settled, in order to secure some finality. If negotiations (on the even more complicated basis of two competitors) start again (after a lapse of time while the options are running out) they may go on indefinitely. There is also a particular reason (perhaps worth mentioning) why we should like to see the Trucial Coast concessions settled as soon as possible; the California Coy. may obtain from Ibn Baud an extension of their mainland concession over the area which he claims in sovereignty in Eastern Arabia, and might thus encroach on Abu Dhabi (where the international boundary can only be fixed by negotiations, at present dormant, with Ibn Baud) unless we have a company established there beforehand. Finally, we cannot be sure that the control of the suggested Califomia-British Coy. would really remain British. I suggest that you might perhaps take a line similar to that suggested in para. 3 of the attached letter of 30th October to Col. Fowle. It could be stated that if, before we entered into our present arrangements with the A.I.O.C. and P.C.L., we had been approached by a company representing the same or a higher degree of British interests, we could have sanctioned negotiations with the Rulers, but that matters have now gone too far with P.C.L. to maxe this practicable. )# S , / I r v i ,o “~7 00 / o gg- J /V-^' I!« 05072/36 .

In view (apart from other considerations) of the difficulty of protecting concessiQnnp,ires on the Trucial Coast and the international complications %&gt; vAi/f' {+J)r*i &lt; fc eventual grant of concessions there to matters stand, P.C.L. have already the California company; moreover, as secured priority of consideration; and this by itself, in view particularly of the wording of the options, seems to preclude ,the opening of negotiations between the California Company and the Sheikhs so long at any rate as P.C.L. remain in the field. 5036 5000 7.363, It therefore seems desirable to let the Company know in advance that it is not likely that we should be able to sanction the grant of concessions/, and we could put this (mainly, at any rate) on the ground of our prior commitments to P.C.L. If you agree, and subject to P.O.concurrence, we would accordingly propose to inform Ballantyne that, as he may know, P.C.L. with the full approval of H.M.G. have already secured, or are taking over from another company, exclusive options granted by the Sheikhs and are at pr esent negotiating for concessions, and that this has been done with the full approval • of H.M.G.; that P.C.L. must accordingly be regarded as having priority, and as H.M.G. are already committed to that company, they can hardly approve of a competitor approaching the Sheikhs at this stage. 4. It is perhaps a matter for consideration whether we should also add that in any case stringent conditions of a political character will have to be laid down by H.M.G. in respect of concessions in this area which, as Ballantyne knows, is of a very v/ild and backward nature, being in no way comparable to Bahrein; that one important consiaeration is the responsibility oi H.M.G. ior protecting the concessionnaires, and that, solely3 Department in order to facilitate the carrying out of this responsibility, the nationality of any Company applying for a concession would be a very relevant factor in the consideration. But I should think that the line suggested in para. 3 above ought to prove sufficient and that it might be unnecessary to run the risk of controversy by bringing forward this- second fundamental point about nationality. What do you think? 5. VYould you kindly let me know by telegraph whether you concur or have any observations to make, and what your views are as regards para. 4 above. We will then consult the F.O. /oura sincerely. (84.) J. a WALTON.FILE COP* P.z. 7421/36. £4 PERSIAN GULP OIL (TRUGIAL COAST). J C ONFIDENTIAL. Mr.Ballantyne called on the 14th October and said that his object was to convey a message from Standard Oil of California. He suggested for consideration that it might be convenient for him, in addition to his usual functions as represent ative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, to form a link between the parent company (Standard Oil) and the India Office in regard to Persian Gulf matters outside Bahrein. For instance, he had 0 recently spoken to the India Office on behalf of the pj* 'Calarabian” Company about the question of j surveying the waters of the Gulf off the Hasa Coast. ^ 1 said that I could not express any opinion about his ^ suggestion but that nrima facie there might be advantages ' ^ in it merely from the point of view of convenience: it was however important to remember in any case that the immediate responsibility of the India Office was confined to A A the Gulf and did not cover Saudi Arabian matters. he then delivered, was that they had now definitely decided to interest themselves in the possibility of oil concessions on the Trucial Coast. He explained that the Company had of course some time ago been approached by various Trucial Sheikhs but for various reasons they had held off from that Coast. They now felt that in existing circumstances it would be worth their while to go in and see what they could would have to be approved by His Majesty’s Government in due £2 Mr*Ballantyne's nsssage from Standard Oil, which get. They fully appreciated that any concessions secured course, in view of the Treaty obligations of the Sheikhs: these/2 A X *7 these obligations did not appear to him to necessitate any prior reference to His Majesty’s Government before negotiations were begun but the Company thought it right to inform His Majesty's Government what was in their mind, I promised to report what Mr.Ballantyne said. I said that I could express no opinion on it, and asked that he should not take silence on my part at our interview, or on the part of the India Office subsequently, as in any way giving any kind of implied approval to the Company's intentions. He said that was quite understood. Incidentally I asked Mr.Ballantyne whether the Company had yet taken any steps to get in touch with any Sheikhs. He said that so far as h$ knew they had not: their decision had only been taken quite recently. Mr.Hamilton would probably be going down to Bahrein shortly to carry on negotiations over the unallotted area of Bahrein. He (Mr.Ballantyne) thought it quite possible that the Company might want to use Mr.Hamilton at the same time for any Trucial negotiations. ft ■$. CL-Ai/SOfii INDIA OFFICE. 16.10.1936P.Z. &lt;413/3 6. Minute Paper. POLITICAL Depart ment ^Vl r ^X* 7 xm) i? C-_ The contents of Bushire express letters of the 23rd September, Nos. 715 S and 716 S, were discussed with Colonel Powle on October 8th. It was agreed that he would discuss these matters with Colonel Loch on his return to the Gulf. Meanwhile the following tentative conclusions were reached:- (a) Boundaries between the Trucial Sheikhdoms. Colonel Fowle pointed out that in view of the smallness of the territories in question there could not be any very a eri q ue ^ i ^fnrr - n^ between the neighbouring Sheikhs ^ ^ A 7 .s regnr r H—their mutual—boundari-e-s-. His general idea was that it would be best to get the Sheikhs to settle the 'i CcAAa boundaries between themselves starting with the Debai- A Abu Dhabi boundarj^'M 7 ^^^^^'^ ^ ^ ^ CtAA VU '^Ltrwas noted from Bushire express letter No. 715 S that the Sheikh of Debai was proposing to go to Abu Dhabi (r&amp;/w\aAAt ^9- ' ^rr-tho m-attee:.

Once the Debai - Abu Dhabi boundary was settled Ch Colonel Fowle thought the others ought not to present ^ I much difficulty. As regards the activities of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. it was agreed that the operations under their option agreements would not be seriously inconvenienced by the lack of clearly defined boundaries. Difficulties would, of course, arise when it came to the operation of would be covered by the Article which it is already proposed' to insert in the commercial concessions under which the Sheikh in question will accept without reservation the decision of the Political Resident in regard to frontier d i s put e s. (b) Undertakings by Sheikhs in regard to protectio n It was pointed out that Colonel Loch’s express letter No.716 S had crossed the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 25th September, No.2730, in which it was suggested that a further approach might be made to the Sheikhs of Shargah and Has-al-Khaimah, with a view to pressing them to give the necessary protection undertaking. Col.Fowle would discover from Colonel Loch whether any action had been taken on this sugge stio n, and if so what the result was. Ifce-anwhilo it wao -not—possible to do any It 'V was noted that in his letter of the 13th August the Sheikh of Shargah had agreed that he would pay at ?i, 3? te/' rs P.2., 7 M S /; / P 2 tji'U &gt; A /&gt;rnU&lt; /»1 o ^ &lt;(hotJt/hy Muhammadan rates for any harm done to the Company’s employees. It was agreed that the demand that the Sheikhs should agree to pay compensation in the event of casualties was merely to impress the seriousness of the natter on them and to ensure that they used every endeavour to give adequate protection to the Company. It was agreed that if it was impossible for the Resident to $et all the Sheikhs to accept unlimited liability in regard to compensation it would probably be sufficient to V make some arrangement on the lines of the Sheikh of ttiargah’s suggestion. If a limit of this kind were put on the compensation to which the Sheikh of Shargah would be liable the same would of course in fairness have to be introduced in the cases of the Sheikhs who had already accepted unlimited liability. LsAjMr —^ Ai— ftjrfriiei 1 frL dieeuooion hnft or— in -parmrd tc protection during the period of the options. The position during the concession period was discussed and it was pointed out that the present proposal was to get from theV Ruler, in the exchange of notes at the time of the approval of the commercial concession, an undertaking in regard to protection on similar lines to that given in respect of the options. After discussion it was, however, agreed that in view of the fact that Article 15 of the draft Trucial commercial concessions binds the Sheikh to giving 'all protection in his power' to the Company and as the failure of a Ruler to implement Article 15 would of itself tend to invalidate the concession as a whole including the royalty clause, it t was ujrffecessary to make any separate provision in regard to protection in the exchange of notes.EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL). -This is an Oil]GINAL message sent by AIR MAIL which provides a means of communication more expeditions than the ordxnary mail and is cheaper than the telegraph.

The reply is not satisfactory, though it is understandable that the Shaikh is unwilling to accept an unlimited liability. 2. There is reason to suppose that the Shaikh of Sharjah has been trying to persuade the other Shaikhs (includiirg the Shaikh of Dib&amp;i, who has already given the undertaking vide paragraph 3 (l) of colonel Fowle’s Express Letter 1T0.566-S of 9th July 193 6) to insist on knowing what amount of compensation will be levied. I think that it would be well to defer replying to this letter till the Dibai concession has been settled. Once the concession with Dibai is finally settled, he may think better of his attitude, especially if then, it is impressed upon him that (Signature) unless./unless he gives the undertaking for protection, he can give no concession, 3.

Major Holmes lunched with me today, and stated as follows. (You know he is always rather vague). (a) That Mr.Skliros (p.C.L.) appeared to he of the opinion that the HA7AR ISLANDS by themselves would not be good enough, without the addition of the mainland territory. (b) That Mr.Skliros also thought, and Major Holmes rather concurred, that if the Bahrein Petroleum Company got any additional areas in Bahrein territory, before the Petroleum Concessions Limited had managed to fix their options and concessions, (particularly the options), on the Trucial Coast, this would encourage the Trucial Coast Sheikhs to intrigue with the Bahrein Petroleum Company with the object of giving options, etc. to them rather than to (c) That he - (Major Holmes) had received information from the Petroleum Concessions Limited 1 s representative in Debai that soon after he - (Major Holmes) had left the Trucial Coast, an Arab on behalf of the Bahrein Petroleum Company had arrived at Debai and approached the Sheikh. The latter had replied that he had made arrangements with Major Holmes, and would not go back on them. (d) That Mr.Skliros hoped that there would not be too great a hurry over demarcating the boundaries of the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms, as this might complicate matters as between the Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Sheikhs. 2* With regard to (a). Nothing can be done until Mr.Belgrave on return to Bahrein finds out from the Sheikh exactly what plan the latter has in mind.

I have received a report from Residency Agent, Sharjah, stating that on hearing that Shaikh Sa f id bin Maktum of Dibai had granted an oil concession, Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi sent a letter and verbal message to him asking what territory he had granted. Shaikh Shakhbut asked that the boundaries might be settled before geologists go out, as he would be responsible for protecting them within the limits of Abu Dhabi and he feared that Shaikh 3a* id might send his armed guard's with the geologists into Abu Dhabi territory. Shaikh Sa« id of Dibai has suggested that he should go to Abu Dhabi as soon as Shaikh shakhbut «s uncle, Shaikh Khalifah bin zaid, (without whose advice Shaikh shakhbut will not do business) returns from Buraimi, in order that they may settle the boundary question. 3. / (Signature) S. 44. t) (’'FP—1124S&amp;P—(M-1314) — 4-8-33 — 12,000.

My dear Clauson, CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON • E.C.2 11th September 193^» At our meeting in your office a few days ago, when Colonel Fowle was present, you suggested that I should send you a summary of our proceedings, actual and intended, in the region which concerns the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. You are, I think, already fully informed on the subject, but perhaps, as you suggested, your information is contained in scattered reports which it would be convenient to summarise. I will therefore do this. * L* In the Neutral Zone, immediately South of the Kuwait Principality, we hoped, early in the present year, to obtain a Concession for the Shaikh of Kuwait*s half-rights over the territory: for which purpose we drafted a Concession and sent you a copy. Later, however, when our negotiator. Major Holmes, was actually in the field, we were led by the advice of the Foreign Office to renounce the idea of a Concession, in view of the delicate inter-state position of the Neutral Zone, and to ask merely for an Option on the Shaikh*s rights. This, in May, it seemed certain that we could obtain. At the last moment, however, the Shaikh refused to sign (tem pering his refusal with many friendly expressions) and said he would prefer to leave the Question temporarily in abeyance. The reason, we believe, was that, owing to his increasingly friendly relations with Ibn Saud, the Shaikh hoped for tne re-incorporation of the Neutral Zone in his own territories (as was the case previous to the de-limitation of the zone) and thus for the power to bestow, not half, but tiie whole. {;; Alfl AIL o - • * ■ ' X No. 410 JO SEP FROM SECRETARY, P AMD SECRET DEPT.

We shall probably return to the charge later in this year, in the hope that the Shaikh will have modified his position. In the Bahrain group of Islands, we intend to obtain a Concession for all the territory (including territorial waters) not already leased to the Bahrain Oil Company. Con tact was made with the Shaikh by Major Holmes and certain amendments to our Draft Concession — of which you were given a copy — were made by the Shaikh. With these we can probably agree. On the financial side we have made what we consider a generous offer, but have not yet the Shaikh*s reply. I am hoping to discuss the revised Draft and offer with Mr. Belgrave within the next few days. The question of ownership of Hawar Island was referred by us to you, and you have replied that it should be considered as Bahrain territory. The Company proposes to make Bahrain the administrative headnuarters of its activities, not only in that Island, but in the whole Persian Gulf area. It is therefore shipping to Manama the necessary equipment for the drilling and geological parties proposed, of which details are given below. Mr. E.V. Packer, whose appointment as Company 1 s Manager in that area you have already approved, has paid a flying visit to the Gulf, and will take ud his residence at Manama on October 19 th. He will be joined there a fortnight later by geologists and drillers, whose work (as will appear below) will be upon the mainland. Mr. Packer will arrange for his house and office accommodation on his arrival, meanwhile occupying Major Holmes 1 house. We are at the moment taking In hand, through the Bombay Agency of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the recruitment of certain Indian personnel, which we think will be necessary for our office, our Qatar drilling programme, and our Trucial Coast geological programme. We have sent you under separate letter particulars of the Indian personnel we propose to import, and are anxious to observe the proper formalities in this connection. In the event of our importing a limited number of rig-coolies from Iraq for work on Qatar, we shall obtain the necessary permits in the same way, but shall, of course, do our own recruiting in Irao. The Company*s interim Agent, nending Mr. Packer*s establishment, is Haji Yusif Kanu. r■) The Qatar Concession remains, at the moment of writing the property of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who obtained it early in 1935, followed this by signing a Political Agreement with H.k.G. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. has now^ formed a subsidiary. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., with the object of taking over the Concession from the A.I.G.C. This proposal has, within the last day or two, received India Office consent, and letters to the Shaikh of Qatar, proposing that he agree to the transfer, are being sent by the A.I.O.C. Abadan and, we understand, by the Political Resident. The text of Abadan*s letter will first have been approved by the Resident. P.D. (Qatar) Ltd. expects, on transfer of the Concession, to assume all the obligations vis-a-vis H.M.G. and the Shaikh, which were previously incumbent on the A.I.O.C. One of these was the drilling of two water-wells on Qatar, and this we propose to carry out during the coming Autumn and Winter. Qatar will be visited by two of our geologists, Messrs. T.F. Williamson and D. Glynn Jones, early in November, for the purpose of siting the wells in consultation with the Shaikh. These will be accompanied, or immediately followed, by Mr. O.S. Dickson, who will be in local charge of the drilling, and by Mr. W. St.G. Hombersley, who will supervise the drilling initially and by subsequent visits. The Company will take over the house already hired by the A.I.O.C. at Doha, and will ship from Bahrain the necessary motor vehicles and drilling and other materials. On the Trucial Coast two-year Options were, as you know, obtained by the A.I.O.C. during 1935 from the Rulers of five out of the six independent Sheikhdoms, Umra-al-, ( aiwain being the exception. lou have, of course, copies of these Options which envisage the granting of a long-term Concession to the same or an associated company during the period. Copies 01 Draft Concessions for the purpose were supplied to you early in the present year and your permission obtained ior tne arrangement of Concessions by our negotiator, Major Holmes. The latter accordingly visited the Trucial Coast in found touch with most of the Shaikhs ana took up his abo e at Sharjah for three months. He found the Shaikhs largely preoccuoied with the pearl-diving season, but was able to make considerable progress with the Shaikh of Dubai, whom he regards as one of the most influential. A Concession was arranged with Shaikh Maktum, the text of which has been =°“- municated to you for your agreement. In the end each of the Articles were initialled by the Shaikh and Major , but the Concession as a whole has not been signea. v,eunderstand that the Shaikh, having heard that he would be asked to enter into a further Agreement with H.M.G. on the subject, was unwilling to sign the Concession until he knew more of the Government obligations it would involve. We hope that all this may be satisfactorily arranged to permit of signature in the present Autumn, when Major Holmes will probably return to the Gulf. Meanwhile the Company hopes to arrange with you the terms of the’’Political Agreement’which, we understand, will be necessarj' in the case of each of the Trucial Coast Concessions. The only point, we believe, upon which difference of opinion between the Company and H.M.G. may occur is in the matter of the latter*s reoulrement for a refinery to be erected on the Arab side of the Gulf, in con nection with oil which may some day be discovered. On this matter the Company has recently addressed you in a separate letter. It is to be noted that only two of the five option-giving Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast have yet signed the security clause propounded to them by the Political Resident, thus securing H.M.G. f s ratification of the Options. The Shaikhs of Shf^jah, AJman and Has-al-Khaimah have not yet signed. We have invited your attention to possible consequences of this failure to sign, and expressed the hope that the Political Resident will be able to represent the matter to them in such a light that they will sign and thus permit ratification of the Options. Without this, we imagine, long term Concessions coula scarcely follow, and our field work might, in the meanwhile, be hampered. It is our intention to send our geological mission named above to Dubai about | the middle of November, after they have sited the Qatar water- | wells, Based on Dubai, where we have leased a house from the Shaikh, and on 4— subsecuent camps,they will explore i the geology of the Dubai-Abu Dhabi Sheikhdoms, and later we ! hope those of Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah. j Major Holmes left the Trucial Coast on September 9 nd and Kuwait tvro or three days later. He will be in England tomorrow', September 12th, for a short visit of consultation and holiday. We have intended to approach the Sultan of Muscat and Oman for a Concession similar to those proposed for the Trucial Coast, but owing to his long absence at Dhofar, we have not yet been in touch with him. We have addressed you separately upon this point. Yours sincerely. M.J.

Major Holmes happened to see the two Rulers concerned on August 27th, and cables to us in the following terms 'Both Rulers who are related dislike indeterminate nature as to what mulct would be imposed therefore their objections to signing protection agreement until maximum of their liability is agreed,' Do you think it likely that the Political Resident will feel abx© to reassure the Shaikhs in such manner as may lead to their signature of the security clause, without which we do not feel our position to be wholly secure, either from the point of view of geological explora tion of their territories, or from that of obtaining a long-term Con cession from them?

It would appear from this that two (and, from our point of view, the two most important) of the Trucial Shaikhs have duly satisfied the reauirement of paragraph 5(c) of your letter No. PZ.8856/55 o; ^ December 12th, 1955- Two more, the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ajman, will probably conform sooner or later. The Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, on the other hand, takes the opposite attitude. If, as is to be presumed, you withhold the consent of His Majesty*s Government (whether temporarily or permanently as dictated by their attitude) from the Options of these Rulers who do not give the necessary security undertaking, what effect do you conceive this would have on our activities and obligations under these Options in the meanwhile? May we safely assume that our geological exploration — which, probably based on Dibai, w T e expect to initiate early in November — may proceed over the territories of Shanjati at least and perhaps those of Ras-al-Khaimah, provided that our geologists adhere to a programme approved by the Ruler the time? It would probably be difficult and certainly inconvenient for them to abandon their pursuit of likely structures on approaching the more or less imaginary boundaries of a Ruler who had not yet signed undertaking.
