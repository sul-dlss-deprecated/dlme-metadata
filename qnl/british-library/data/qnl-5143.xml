No. 65 7 &amp; of 1364 Office of the Adviser to tlB Government, Bal Dated, 8tli R/Thani, March E2, 1945. ^rorn C. Dalryraple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain Bahrain, Persian Gulf, To His Britannic Majesty's political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject -pf the two wards in the Bahrain Government Hospital which by arrangement with the Royal Air rorce have for the past 2- years been used by Service patients of the three Services, the Royal Navy, the Army and the R.A.F. In doing so I should like it to be understood that the Bahrain Government has no wish to terminate the present arrangement for any ulterior motive or for any reason of gain but only because changed conditions appear to warrant a new arrangement. His Highness Shaikh Sulman has at all times been anxious to do everything that is possible to assist His Majesty's forces who are quartered in his territoris and the fact that his hospital has been of use to the R.A.P. has caused him considerable gratificatiorjbut the medical position in Bahrain is now ver37 different to the position when these hopsital Vjrards were made available, 2, All three Services, excluding the British Overseas &gt; Airways Corporation, are becoming increasingly indepen dent in providing medical facilities for out-patients and for minor- : in-patients. The R.A.F. has an air conditioned hospital at Muharraq, the Navy has a Sick- 2 - Bay at Jufair and the Amy, I understand, has made arrangements at Rafaa for hospital cases. Most major emergencies from all Services are flown to base hospitals in Iraq for special treatment. 3. It appears that in-patients in the Bahrain Govern ment Hospital are likely to 'be few this year and will consist mainly of special cases, chiefly emergencies, who cannot be evacuated and also cases which require routine treatment. The in-patient facilities in the ; Bahrain Government Hospital are, it seems, becoming \y superfluous and the maintenance of the R.A.F. medical staff would seem largely unnecessary. 4. If it could be arranged the Bahrain Government would like to take over one of the two wards which are now available for the Services. There is at present a waiting list of local patients requiring hospital treatment and the Government wards are always full. The Governmoit has under consideration the opening of a nursing home which would be mainly for the use of European patients, but it is improbable that this scheme will be embarked upon till after the war. 5. I suggest that the present arrangement should now be modified and that the Services should retain one ward and that the other ward should be handed back to the Bahrain Government, or, after six months time, the following arrangement should be made:- (a) The Bahrain Government will maintain the north front ward of 12 beds and one private single bed ward for treatnent of European patients, British Overseas Airways Corporation, Merchant service, Bahrain civil population and any occasional service patients who may need special treatment. ^ * o 9 aw*- * '(b) Bahrain Government nursing staff to be employed in this ward. 6. In any case should any grave emergency occur the medical facilities of the Bahrain Government hospital would be available to the fullest possible extent, 7. I should be grateful if you would obtain from the authorities concerned an expression of their views on my suggestions. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ^ &lt;r - ^ Adviser to the Government. 3. ZCONFIDSI-rriAL . POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN. No. C/430. Dated the 5th Aprii-^ 1945.

My dear ■ ^ I received your memorandum lTo.C/U30 dated Sth April 191|5 on the subject of the two wards in the Bahrein Government Hospital which, 'by arrangement with the Royal Air Force, have during the passed two and a half ye-irs 'been used 'by Service patients of the thi s ee Services - The loyal Navy, Army and the Royal Air Force, I regret delay in replying to your Memorandum, 'but as you know, we are at present working on the Air Trooping Scheme and the accommoiation required to meet our commitments at Bahrein. So far I am unable to give you definite replies to the proposals put forward in para.2 of your memorandum. After careful study 'by my principal Medical Officer, who suggests that if no inconvenience is put on the Bahrein G-overnment that the present arrangements should stand at least for a further six months, and that the position 'be then reviewed. The six months would give us time to study the changing conditions and to work out and get approval for further extensions to the sick quarters which are 'being erected at Muharraq Airfield. I wish I could he more helpful hut our plans at this moment are changing rapidly, and I think it would 'be 'better for us to leave the matter as it stands at present and review it again in October of this year. If you agree I would 'be pleased to hear your views and any suggestions. IH s' -../:-. t -;rlW ■ ■■ : i' ' ■ . - . -J Yours ^ \ w \^ Political Agent, Bahrain. ?.S. ^ \v c*v1 CONFIDENTIAL .

Possibly it would be'as well to ask the Adviser to elucidate before the V* ^consulted. I think what they are really proposing is that one ward should be given back now and-the second after six months when they will reserve it for Europeans and occasional service patients.
