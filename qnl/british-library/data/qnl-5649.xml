On the occasion of Holmes’ visit to the Gulf early this year the Petroleum Division with our agreement sponsored an air passage for him in the light of the special circumstances prevailing at the time (your letter PD 745 Pt.3 of 9th February, 1944). On the present occasion the only reason so far as we are aware that can be adduced for Holmes' proposed visit is that the Sheikh has asked him to come. While we are of course anxious to meet the Sheikh's wish in the matter, this consideration will not in our opinion constitute a sufficient reason by itself to justify our sponsoring an air passage for Holmes, I should be grateful for your observations on the matter, and to know whether there are in fact any special considerations which the Petroleum Division would think to justify an air passage.

Mr. Rhoades was apparently representing this joint interest when he went to Koweit for his abortive discussions on the matter with the Sheikiin 1943 * Petroleum Concessions Ltd. approached the Sheikn through ^ Major H olme s^in 193&amp; but the Sheilbvtold them that he did not wish t° enteF into negotiations at the moment, adc^yig that when he did desire to open negotiations he would let them'know first.* The India Office gave an assurance to P.C.L. on the 15th November, 1939&gt; that we would inform P.C.L. if the Sheikkintended to modify his attitude and that in any case we would allow them to make an offer i before approving the grant of the concession covering the Sheikils f /’2.^77/i?rights to another company. T It is, I suppose, also possible that A.A.O.C. might wish to approach the Sheikh simply on their own behalf, i.e. without Eastern Gulf taking any part. Even if he is now prepared to consider negotiations it is perhaps unlikely that the SheikAwould be in favour of such a proposal since it would involve assimilating the position of the Neutral Zone to the rest of Saudi-Arabia so far as oil concessions are concerned. This is apart altogether from the question of whether it would be consistent with H.M.G*s interest &gt; t o allow an American as opposed to a British company to acquire the /5il interests in the Neutral Zone, and one would expect that the / Petroleum Division would not be in favour of such an idea.

After receiving your letter of 30th September, No.Ext.5469/43, I notified the Company that the Political Resident had no objection to Major Holmes visiting Kuwait. Consequent upon this Holmes got into communication with the Sheikh and has now received a telegram from the latter, which reads as follows:- 'Many thanKS for your congratulations. When may I expect you.'* The Company themselves are somewhat doubtful whether the Sheikh 1 s telegram can be read as implying that he is willing to discuss the Neutral Zone concession or whether the telegram should only be interpreted as a general expression of goodwill. | In any case they would lixe to know in the first place whether the India Office would be likely to favour or to object to the visit, and if the former whether there would be any chance of an air passage. Holmes is now an elderly man and I understand that it is doubtful whether he would be willing to travel by a less direct route. perhaps you would kindly let me know your views so that I can inform the Company accordingly.

Please refer to my demi-official letter No. 631 dated the 28th August 1943. 2. I am enclosing copies of five letters from Holmes and a copy of a telegram to hik from His highness. I have recently been informed by the Shaikh that he has agreed to Holmes* suggestion of visiting Kuwait in the autumn, and I have sten a telegram from Holmes which announced his intention of arriving here in October or November if he could obtain the necessary passage. 3. The first letter written on the 23rd February contains a suggestion for the sub-division of the Neutral Zone should the Shaikh be prepared to negotiate. The first of the letters of the 4th of June indicates clearly where Holmes* sympathies lie and where he thinks the Shaikh’s should, even suggesting a possible loss of money, a very potent argument with His Highness, should he inclined to favour American interests. The letter is interesting but is not factually correct. The second letter of the 4th of June is an intimation that P.C.L. propose to enter the arena if the games are held. The letter of the 12th of June deals more fully with the transit of Basra Oil to Kuwait and forecasts the development of Kuwait harbour. I have no record of this transit suggestion previously having been put forward. The last letter suggests that the old warrior may possibly try his hand again at the old game. Yours sincerely, Sd.

To Hi&amp; Highneee bhaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir A8-Subah, KCIS., CSI«, KUWAIT. Your Highness Greetings. It is with a certain amount of diffidence that I address Your Highness on the subject of the regaining Territory not allo cated - of Your Highness* dominions outside the area acauired by your Oil Company. i must first make it clear to Your Highness that I have not mentioned the subject matter of this letter to any person or persons in England or elsewhere. Therefore, may I suggest that no mention be made in regard to the contents herein to any of the local non-subjects. as Y 0 ur Highness* representative here, I feel that it is my duty to lay before Your Highness* certain suggestions and views which I trust may later be of some help to Your High ness when Your Highness deems the time appropriate to deal with the area discussed below. I wish, a Iso, to inform Your Highness that I have no intention oi being an agent for any company or person desiring to ad(^uire a concession for oil or other mineral from Your Highness. My one desire is to work for and on behalf of the interests of Your Highness so long as Your Highness wishes me to do so. The area to which this letter refers is that section of territory situated to the south of Your Highness* boundary and which is held in joint ownership by Your Highness and the roller of the adjoining Kingdom. Hereinafter referred to as the Joint area . The Joint Area embraces a section of fch* territory of approximately 1,861 square miles (English). xhe custom - in the past, when dealing with an unproved area, has been for Rulers to grant larger areas of prospective oil bearing territory to Companies which are prepared to risk a considerable amount of money to prove if it be oil bearing or not• I to would be entirely inappropriate in the ease of the Joint Area to grant the vihole area in one concession, because the Joint Area is to all intent and purpose proved as being oil bearing. Oil has been discovered in highly payable quantities both on the North and South of the Joint Area. The oil bearing structures, of which there are two, in my opinion run through the Joint Area from north to south. There is no sign - on the Joint Area - of any disturbance of the earth s structure, the formation of the rocks being in conformity with those to the north and south. It is well to point out to Your Highness that large areas are not necessary to success, for instance, the Bahrain con cession ha» an area of 156 square miles, this restricted area has proved to be sufficient to develop a large yielding and prosperous oil company. Further, all oil won on Bahrain has come from an area of about 10 square miles. The position of and the fact that the Joint ~rea is a proved area, there can be no doubt as to its rich oil bearing potentialities, brings up the question as to how tv»e Joint ^ eaLCopy of letter dated the 4th June 1943 from Afejor Frank Holmes, Millhill, Saiidon, Chelmsford, Essex, to His Hi^iness Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabar as Subah, KCIE,CSI,Kuwai t. in considering to whom the Oil Concession, covering Your Highness* interest in the Neutral Zone, should eventually be granted, there are several points which it is necessary to take into account apart from those pertaining to the Hettral Zone. i will, with lour Hi^iness* permission, lay before lour Highness my ideas which i hope will be weleorne. The first is the final designation of the Oil won from the Area under discussion. The the concession be given to the Gulf Oil Comapny( represented by Mr. Rhoades] in partnership with the Standard Oil Coy - the latter having the rights of His Majesty’s interest in the heutral Zone - there is the prospect as the Standard Oil Coy has a refinery near Has Tanura (Katif) , it follows that oil recovered from the heutral Zone will oe diverted to that refinery and Your Highness* interest - in the Oil obtained from the heutral Zone - will be confined solely to the Royalty payable per ton on Gil won. In these circumstances it appears to me that there will certainly be a loss of contro by lour Highness if the oil be pumped to Ras Tanura refinery. The question ol labour control in a joint company may present difficulties and divert certain charges, difficult to enumerate off-hand, but deal principally with local labour employment conditions. lour Highness my remember a discussion i Had - at Mr. Skilros* instigation - with i our Kighne ss, when last in Kuwait, dealing with the Transit Dues payable to Your Highness upon Oil brought from Basra for shipment through Kuwait Harbour. The Transit Dues payable upon such oil would eventually provide a large sum of money each year and would continue to increase as the oilfields of Basra Vilayet developed. m fact, the revenue from oil in transit is without cost to Your Highness except perhaps for the salaries of* two or three local men for checking, on behalf of Your Highness* fcxi&amp;x&amp;fc Atm jtixxfxiLix&amp;uaB the amount of oik arriving through the pipe line at Kuwait end. in addition the oil won from Your Highness* half of the Neutral Zone will no doubt pass through Kuwait Harbour. After close study of the whole position in Kuwait - in respect of the oil development within Your Ki^iness* Shaikh- som and taking the rich prospect of a constant and large revenue from transit oil from Basra - 1 feel conficent that greater gain would ensue to Your Highness if your half interest in the keutral Zone were placed with Mr. Skliros to develop and would give Your Highness fuller control and yield richer results than can be proved by any other applicant. i make this statement with much confiaence as no other applicant can make a **transit dues* 4 offer as all the Iraq Oilf ields, including Basra Vilayet, are uncer the control of Mr. Skliros* Companies. I I have no personal interest in anyway as to who secures the oil rights of Territory under Your Highness* control except to point out what 1 consider would be most advantageous to the interest of Your Highness and Your people.4th June 1943 M1LLHILL, SAKDON, CH ELMSF ORD, ESSEX. T o His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabar as Subah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., KUWAIT . Your Hi^iness Greetings. i have not had the pleasure of receiving any communication from Your Highness recently. I hope that all is well with Your Highness and your people. Mr. Rhoades is now in Loncbn, he informed me that it was his intention to visit Xour Highness ao aoon &amp;s he could secure a passage by one of the overseas Airway aeroplanes. From Mr.Rhoades’ talk i gathered that he hoped to be able to discuss with you a concession agreement covering Your Highness * portion of the Heutral £one, but he wishes, in the first place, to conclude with Your Highness some business with the Oulphur Comapny. Mr. Skliros - with Your Highness* kind permission - will also wish to renew his application for an Oil concession covering Your Highness' half of the .Neutral Zone whenever you deem it wise to enter into such negotiations. it is very gratifying to know that 1 shall not - in the future - be in the position of a negotiator and having to request something from Your Highness instead of oeing free to assist Your Highness and so repay, in small degree, the manifold kindnesses i have always received from Your Highness, for which i am most grateful. i am looking forward.to visiting muwait and to forget entirely al i the worries of war-time farming; although i cannot complain as our wheat oats and bean crops look very promi sing. With good wishes, i remain. Your Kighness’ sincere friend and grateful servant, 3d. Frank HolmesCOPY 1* y- 12th June 1943. Millhill* Sandon, Chelmsford, Essex. His Highness Lihaikh Sir Ahmed al J atmr-As-Sut an, KCiE. ,CSi., Kuwait. Your Highne ss, Greetings, ^ ^ „ 1 wrote two letters to Your Highness botn oi which were dated 4th June. The reason for this letter is to make clear to Your Highness the potential value - m revenue to the State oi Kuwait - of “Transit Dues'. During my last visit to Kuwait i discussec Aith * 0 ur Highness the question of lour Highness granting a tiansi^ permit tight to Petroleum Concessions for conveying the oil won from the Basra concession to Kuwait? this would also cal j for the right to build a pipe-line to convey the oil from the Basra - Kuwait boundary to the Kuwait harbour. When I wrote on June 4th to Your Highness i was unable to give the amount of the 'Transit Dues 11 per ton of oil delivered to trie Kuwait end of the pipe-line as 1 had forgotten and had to refer to Mr. Skliros, which i have now done. The 'Transit Dues' - payable to Your Highness by the Company - would be at the rate of Annas 2(twoJ per ton of oil imported through Kuwait territory from the Basra Concess ion area. ^ ^ in order to give lour Highness some idea oi the importance of such “Transit Dues*' the revenue from each one million tons of Basra concession Oil - delivered adjacent to the Kuwait Harbour - would amount to Rupees 125,000/- lone hundred and twenty five thousand rupees). As the development oi the Basra Oil Concession Area progresses it is reasonable to assume that the yearly out put of oil from the rich Basra Concession Area - will increase to several million tons per annum, with a corresponding increase A&amp;xssxkx&amp;Il of Revenue to the State oi Kuwait. The Transit of oil scheme from Basra is a business that must be secured for the State ol Kuwait, as it presents no difficulties nor will it cause any expense to Your Highness beyond the salaries of two or three men to check - on Your Highness’ behalf - the auantity of oil arriving at the Kuwait terminus of the pipe-line on which “Transit Dues' is payable. Your Highness may have heard that the Americans have built a new river port near Kao on the Shatt-al-Arab. l am net altogether happy about these activities on the Shatt-al-Arab, so am anxious to hear Your Highness 1 ideas on tVie transit ©foil scheme across Kuwait territory. There is one thinfe 1 do not wish one morning Ao be told that the Basra oil is to a Shatt-al-Arab port and thus lose to Kuwait an fine source of revenue. Your Highness need not have any doubts that the amenities of the town of Kuwait or its surrounding shall be affected detrimentally* The pipe-lme will most probably deliver the oil on the north shore of the Kuwait Harbour, a few miles east of ^arrah. There is much space to develop the necessary facilkites or handling the shipment and even refining of the oil, and that area being so remote no inconvenience will be experienced by the people of Kuwait town. . The Harbour of Kuwait is certainly a very rich possession and its development in the years to come will exceed sxxjbis^ expectations. i trust that Your Hiness will not - - ~ ' * -— wx time. to wake up be pumped to except ional ly01 2 My excuse is that 1 have only one though in iry mind and that is i desire nothing but to hell, to the extent of ray abilities, and always having a deep regard for the welfare of the person of lour Highness and of your people. une of ray greatest possessions ana most dear to me is the friendship of your Highness granted me during many years. 1 am always grateful. With good wishes, 1 remain, lour Highness’ sincere friend and faithful servant, 3d. jj’rank Holmes.

The Oil world are all endeavouring to secure rights over territory which gives signs of being productive* These sudden activities of oil interests - outside the British Empire - caused quite a little consternation among the unexpected especially from the quarter from which the intense activities developed. In my opinion, Your Highness acted with wisdom and vision when you decided to postpone consideration of all such applications. Personally I was much pleased to hear of Your Hi^iness’ ideas, but It is well for me to conf ess to Your Highness that 1 hope that Your Highness* old and tried English friends will be given an opportunity m developing whatever resources lour Highness eventually decides upon. i would much like to visit Kuwait in October o r November of this year; i have no business to discuss with you nad would come purely to see lour Highness and have one or&amp;wo montas of Kuwait air and relaxation. So if Your Highness is agreeable to my visiting Kuwait, 1 would be much pleased if Your Highness Upon receipt of this letter, would kindly send me a telegram agreeing the visit. We are in the midst of both our hay and grain harvest, with labour so scarce the work of garnering the corn and hay looks like an impossible feat, but no doubt we will manage it somefaow or other.

Abdul Aziz al Nai isi, the Saudi Government (Approx) Agent complained to Dickson without proper permission having been obtained as he had now received a letter of con^laint from the Amir of Khabbar upbraiding him, Nasif i, for not having let him know that Rhoades was coming and saying he had no information from other sources. 3. Rhoades flys out from the united States to discuss a subject he has been informed on the best authority that the Shaikh will not even consider and to make arrangements for extensive exploration by the Sulphur Company. The result of his talks with the Shaikh was a foregone conclusion.

My dear Bridgeman, r* KUWAIT - Neutral aone. I am informed that the failure of certain recent negotiations has not been received with good grace by the Principals concerned , and that it is proposed to approach the matter afresh f rom a different angle; the idea is that Ibn Saud should be induced to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh of Kuwait to hurry up and do something about it. That is not likely to take place; there are differences between those two Rulers, hut Ibn Saud is of good Arao stock, and I doubt whether, during his lifetime, whatever be the appearances, Arnhia will be allowed to do much coercion on one whose flther A fed and sheltered Ibn Saud for many years before he carved out for himself a throne of his own. But be that as it may, it looks as if one must continue to watch the position with vigilance. I do not propose to move P.C.L. in the matter, for the present; any such premature approach coil'_ only be met by the same old interim reply that the time is not ye propitious. The Sheikh still fancies his chance for a mutually satisfactory partitioning of that Zone, he retaining the loithern half and, as that is probably the better half, I am content to wax until he is in full possession. i In the last letter which you transmitted, f^om Holmes to the Sheikh, the former said that he would like to visit Kuwait if the Sheikh considered it advisable, and the latter has cable^ that Holmes would be very welcome. My own deferred line ox action would be quite well served by Holmes visiting the Sheikh in his capaci y of Adviser to him in oil matters; there is no question of my employing Holmes as P.C.L. negotiator, and for the present I am not asking for anything. The oroiected visit calls for an air passage, and that is where you come in. Holmes would like to leave end October or early November, returning by theend of the year. If sucn a thing were obtainable - assuming there is no I.0. objection to his visit on political or any other ground - I think he could do my case a bn of good by going out.

On 6.5,43 I enquired from the General Manager Dhahran if I might visit Abraq Kabrit camp. On 8.5.43 Mr. Ohliger telegraphed a cordial invita- ation to visit not only Kabrit but to continue on to Dhahran. As the season was too far advanced for such an undertaking and as car difficulties had tc be considered, I replied by wire that 1 could only visit Kabrit. The P.A. who was kept informed by me of my proposed journey was very helpful ana the Saudi Arabian Government’s local representative gave his approval arid furnished me with an official letter to the Saudi Arabian representative on the spot. On 12-5-43(p.n.) I proceeded to Abraq Kabrit via the Neutral Zone route, spent the night en route and reached my destination at 7.30 a.m. on 13-5-43. I received a most cordial and kindly welcome from the Supdt in charge of the camp and all the C.A.S.O.C. staff, after spending the whole.of the 13-5-43 anc the following night with them, returned at cawn on 14-5-43 via the west ern Garaa route lying approx. 15 miles west of the Shaqq depression). I entered Kuwait territory via Minaqish. The outward journey took 5 running hours, and the homeward journey 5-f running hours. Distances were approximately as follows: outward 110 miles; homeward 125 miles. Whilst at Kabrit camr (which incidentally is called 'Jauf' by C.A.S.O.C. folk), I was shown everything, including the rig and the water well and was taken over the Khalija 'Sink**, some 6 miles distant which local Badawin claim to be the site where a meteorite well many' **•' years agol I I purposely asked no questions about oil drilling oper ations as this would have been in bad taste, but I gathered that drilling had been going on for a month, and that M sana M difficulties haa been encountered. I emphasised that I was only interested in the Company’s water well, and J .at my request the Supdt. in charge gave me a drum of \ /water to • • • ••water to bring back with me* Two bottles of this have been sent to you by Tug '*H1IRALD M which leaves Kuwait for yours tomorrow (17-5-43) and similar sables were given to K.K. the Shaikh and the local Saudi Representative AbuiLl Aziz al Nafisi who asited for same. When being shown over the water well, I was told that the depth to water level was 150 ft and that a power ful centrifugal pump brought up the water, and pumped it through a 6 H pipe to the camp area. The water well contained ll w casing, I gathered. A second reserve water well was shown me, 30 yards from the main well, and was worked by a compressor. Its capacity was 80 barxiLs per hour. The water appeared quite sweet to the taste and was cold, but local officials said that lor the first 3 or 4 days, it had a slight rt iipsom' t Salt’s effect on a person cringing the water. This passed off however, and the whole camp(except Americans) dranx the water and were pleased with it. The American staff (numbered 11) drank distilled water from Dhahran. The rig of course was served by the above well. I gathered that owing to the shortage of our transport all oil stores were brought by camel from the small port of Man if a (south of Safariyeh ) , develpped by the Company, and that camels were engaged in bringing other stores, for which there was no immediate hurry, from as far away as Dhahran. ? y The fig was driven by 'Diesel* engine ana the whole of the rig platform, pump engines and Diesel were enclosed in a corrugated iron shed: The camp had its own wireless, ice$iachine, soda plant, garage etc, and the living rooms were all air conditioned ana most comfortable. Feeding arrangements appeared to be of the highest order. An Amir and five armed men representing the Saudi Arabian Government lived in the canqp, and extended a most cordial welcome to me and insisted on my taking coffee with them twice. Arrangements also existed for local Badwin to draw water ana water their camels and sheep at two separate points on the 3 mile stretch of 6 H pipe which conveyed water from well to camp. These consisted of side pipes 2 U controlled by a cock, which led off the main to shallow metal water containers. I was told that the builf- ing of cement water troughs was contemplated. On my return to Kuwait I conveyed my thani s for all the kind hospitality shown me by a telegram toMr.Ohliger. I also gave verbal report on rny Journey etc. to K.M’s Political Agent. It is perhaps worth mentioning that between Wafra and Shathaff wells in the Deutral Zone quantities of locusts in the 'crawler” stage were met with, South of Shathaf as far as the southern boundary of the heutral Zone Baaawin apparently felt no concern and claimed that all would aie as a result of the heat af summer.

Skliros, Esq. I saw Hamilton and Newton on Thursday the Savoy Hotel. Hamilton* s view is that Ibn Saud can practically force Shaikh Ahmed to do as he ‘ (ibn Saud) wishes and that the Neutral Zone is not an isolated area but is bound up with at least one other area, which I take he means the Iraq-Saudia Neutral Area. Hamilton is certainly a disappointed i man as evidently the G-ulf and Standard Oil of California have gone far into the question of forming a Company to operate the Neutral Zone. Hamilton* s disappointment was based on the fact that Ibn Baud* s wishes would not necessarily be acceded to without question by Shaikh Ahmed. Rhoades had cabled Hamilton to the above effect. Hamilton asked me if I thought the Arab Rulers - apart from Ibn Saud* s territory - would agree to the construction of a pipe line across their separate /territories£\A.

I wrote two letters to Your Highness both of which were dated 4th June. * xj/ v \J JmT 4..- J* The reason for this letter is to make clear to Your Highness the potential value - in revenue to the State of Kuwait - of 'Transit Dues'. During iqy last visit to Kuwait I discussed with Your Highness the question of Your Highness granting a transit permit right to Petroleum Concessions for conveying the oil won from the Basra concession to Kuwait; this would also call for the right to build a pipe-line to convey the oil from the Basra-Kuwait boundary to the Kuwait Harbour. When I wrote on June 4th to Your Highness I was unable to give the amount of the 'Transit Dues' per ton of oil delivered to the Kuwait end of the pipe-line as I had forgotten and had to refer to Mr. Skliros which I have now done. The ’'Transit Dues' - payable to Your Highness by the Company - would be at the rate of Annas 2 (Two) per ton of Oil imported through Kuwait Territory from the Basra concession Area. In order to give Your Highness some idea of the importance of such 'Transit Dues' the revenue from each one million tons of Basra Concession Oil - delivered adjacent to the Kuwait Harbour - would amount to Rupees 125,000 (One Hundred and Twenty Five Thousand Rupees). As the development of the Basra Oil Concession Area progresses it is reasonable to assume that the yearly, output of Oil - from the rich Basra Concession Area - will increase to several million tons per annun/annum, with a corresponding increase of Revenue to the State of Kuwait. The Transit of oil scheme from Basra is a Business that must he secured for the State of Kuwait, as it presents no difficulties nor will it cause airy expense to Your Highness beyond the salaries of two or three men to check, on - Your Highness* behalf the quantity of oil arriving at the Kuwait teminus of the pipe-line • on which ^Transit Dues” is payable. Your Highness may have heard that the Americans have built a new river port near Foa on the Shatt-al-Arab. I am not altogether happy about these activities on the Shatt-al-Arab, so am anxious to hear Your Highness* ideas on the transit of Oil scheme across Kwait territory. There is one thing I do not wish to wake up one morning to be told that the Basra oil is to be pumped to a Shatt-al-Arab port and thus lose to Kuwait an exceptionally fine source of revenue. Your Highness need not have any doubts that the amenities of the town of Kuwait or its surroundings shall be affected detrimentally. The pipe-line will most probably deliver the oil on the north shore of the Kuwait Harbour, a few miles east of Jarrah* There is much space to develop the necessary facilities for handling the shipment and even refining of the oil, and that area being so remote no inconvenience will be experienced by the people of Kuwait town. The Harbour of Kuwait is certainly a very rich possession and its development in the years to come will exceed all expectations. I trust that Your Highness will not weaiy of the ideas put before Your Highness from time to time. I4y excuse is that I have only one thought in my mind and that is I desire nothing but to help, to the extent of ny abilities, and always having a deep regard for the welfare of the person of Your Highness and of Your people. One/3. One of my greatest possessions and most dear to me is the friendship of Your Highness granted me during many years. I am always grateful.

Mr. Rhoades is now in London, he informed me that it was his intention to visit Your Highness so soon as he could secure a passage by one of the Overseas Airway aeroplanes.

Mr. Skliros - with Your Highness* kind permission - will also wish to renew his application for an Oil concession covering Your Highness* half of the Neutral Zone whenever you deem it wise to enter into such negotiations. It is very gratifying to know that I shall not - in the future - be in the position of a negotiator and having to request something from Your Highness instead of being free to assist Your Highness and so repay, in some gm»Vl degree, the manifold kindnesses I have always received from Your Highness, for which I am most grateful. I am looking forward to visiting Kuwait and to forget entirely all the worries of war-tijne farming; although I cannot complain as our wheat, oats and bean crops look veiy promising. With good wishes, I remain. Your Highness' sincere friend and grateful servant, (Sgd.)

I will, with Your Highness 1 permission, lay before Your Highness ny ideas which X hope will be welcome* The first is the final designation of the Oil won frcm the Area unier discussion* If the concession be given to the Gulf Oil Company (represented by Mr* Rhoades) in partnership with the Standard Oil Coy - the latter having the ri^its of His Majesty^ interest in the Neutral Zoos - there is the prospect, as the Standard Oil Ccy has a refinery near Ras Tanura (Katif), it follows that oil recovered from the Neutral Zone will be diverted to that refinery and Your Highness* interest - in the Oil obtained from the Neutral Zone - will be confined solely to the Royalty payable per ton on Oil won. . uo.V. X *. ?o o u In these circumstances it appears to me that there will certainly be a loss of control by Your Highness if the oil be pumped to Ras Tanura refinery. The question of labour control in a Joint company may present difficulties and divert certain charges, difficult to enumerate off-ha»i, but deal principally with local labour employment conditions* Your Highness may remfltmber a discussion I nad “ at Mr* SkLiros* instigation - with Your Hi^aness, when last in Kuwait, dealing with the Transit Dues payable to Your Highness upon Oil brought from Basra for shipment through Kuwait Harbour 0 The Transit Dues payable upon such Oil would eventually provide a large sum of money each year and would continue to increase as the Oilfields of Basra Vilayet developed* In fact, the revenue from Oil in transit is without cost to Your Highness except perhaps for the salaries of two or three local men for/for checking, on behalf of Your Highness, the amount of oil arriving through the pipe lire at Kuwait end. * c ‘w. In addition the Oil won from Your Highness* half of the Neutral Zone will no doubt pass through Kuwait Harbour. c - .v - * v - After close study of the whole position in Kuwait - in respect of the oil development within Your Highness* Shaikhdom and taking the rich prospect of a constant and large revenue from transit oil from Basra - I feel confident that greater gain would ensue to Your Highness if your half interest in the Neutral Zone were placed with Mr. Skliros... to develop and would give Your Highness fuller control and yield richer results than can be provided by any other applicant. I make this statement with much confidence as no other applicant can make a 'transit dues' offer as all the Iraq Oilfields, including Basra Vilayet, are under the control of Mr. Skliros* Companies. V v . ' . v*w -v ^V I have re personal interest in anyway as to who secures the oil rights of Territory under Your Highness* control except to point out what I consider would be most advantageous to the interest of Your Highness and Your people. ° I remain, w Your Highness* sincere friend and loyal servant, (Sgd. ) FRANK HOLMES.B 39 C.9.39 Us- Horsham 785 r TELEPHONE : *IAT40NAL JSfll CODES: IO TELEGRAMS: INLAND : P6TC©N€K9», E? •t®MBOM FOREIGN :^eT€0N«6#Sr*®NOON- PETC©N«KI ilGN BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE BENTLEY’S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT LOMBARD PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED DIRECTORS: G.

I enclose a copy of a letter from Holmes to Skliros which will, I thinx be of interest to you in this connection. It may be rather difficult for us to give any indication to the Political Resident at Koweit of Rhoades’ probable date of arrival as we cannot submit to the Priority Board that his journey is essential in the interests of the war effort, and it is therefore possible that even after leaving here he may experience some delay at either Lagos or Cairo. However, as soon as we have made whatever arrangements are possible at this end we can au least intorm tne Political Resident of the date on which he left this country. Incidentally, Angus has oust rung up to fix an appointment for Rhoades to see us tomorrow morning. Yours sincerely . W. R.

He is seeing the India Offree today but has already been told by the 1.0. that there is nothing doing so far as the N.Z. is concerned. Rhoades however is under the impression that - as he intends to talk to H.H. about extending the operation on the sulphur property - he will be able to v/ork in a discussion about a N.^. concession. He also tells me that he has permission to export sulphur machinery from U.6.A. Government. The latter has given a priority licence to have the necessary machinery manufactured and shipped to Koweit. He also informed Lie that the Californian Jtandard Oil had got Ibu Sands half of N.X and that when he (Rhoades) had secured the rights of H.H. a company would be formed by the Standard and Gulf companies on the lines of the Koweit Oil. Rhoades appeared to me to be very cocksure that ne could do much with H.H.)if not the concession from H.H. on this trip he would get the promise that H.H. would grant Rhoades’ people the concession (on the N.'J) when H.H. was ready to ’’talk business”.

Rhoades emphasised at the outset that his proposed visit to Koweit had other objects j . o * besides that of negotiating with the Sheikh about the neutral zone. His Company* s sulphur concession in Koweit obliged them to undertake a certain amount of drilling before December 1944-, and he wished to make arrangements for this on the spot. He did not know how the Sheikh had heard that he wished in addition to discuss the neutral zone, but he had no desire to make a secret of his intentions in this respect. J. I said that the Sheikh had not got his information from us or from the local political authorities. He had told the latter that he • /would3 Vjtjii aiiiut lo ssl^^od 0*7 • ii3 :uo\ oS a v xi&gt;VU '.

We would not be prepared to put pressure on the Sheikh in a matter of this kind, or even attempt to influence him one way or another. Rhoades said that he appreciated this and did not suspect the Political authorities of having influenced the Sheikh’s present attitude. He agreed with me that the Sheikh had, for reasons of his own, maintained this attitude over a number of years, and that he had refused to depart from it at the time ofy^hoades*) visit to Koweit in 19¥). 4* I felt bound to tell Rhoades that Petroleum Concessions Ltd., had also heard - but not from us - of his proposed visit to Koweit, and had said that if he was going there with the object of discussing /the la &amp; 1 /'SJ! r 1 .i.' X S lU C J-l ' jUjo iJi. a 7i tnensi l ine o as vcroOthe neutral zone they would also want to send a representative in order not to lose the chance of making a bid for the concession. I added that, as long ago as 1936j the Sheikh had told P.C.L. that if he were to modify his refusal to open negotiations he would let them know first. Rhoades accepted this with equanimity f but said that the Sheikh had given a similar assurance to his own Comparer. 5. Rhoades said that he did not yet knew how he was going to get to Xcweit from this country, I advised him to apply to your department about this. I said we would help him to get a visa and exit permit and have since sent him the necessary forms to fill up and return to the Passport Office. 6, It will be necessary for us to inform the Political Resident that Rhoades is deter mined to proceed with his journey. In so doing it might be well to give some indication of when he is likely to arrive in Kbweit.

Skliros recalled that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, by their agreement with the Saudi Arabian Government of May 1939, had extended their fioncession to cover, inter alia , the Saudi portion of the Neutral Zone; and that for seme time it had been clear that American interests were anxious to secure similar rights in the Sheikh of Koweit’s area^ of the Zone. He now understood that Mr. Rhoades of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company was about to visit Koweit in order to negotiate with the Sheikh for this purpose. He emphasised that there was much evidence that the Americans were bent on expanding their holdings in the Oil areas of the Middle East; for instance, they were trying to discover flaws in the position of his own Company in Iraq. With such objects in view they were invoking the doctrine of the r, open door', which advocated that competition for the right to exploit mineral and other resources in undeveloped countries should be open to the capital of all other countries on an equal basis. , Mr. Skliros said that his Company, under the guise of Petroleum Concessions Limited, already held various oil Concessions in Arabia; and they were anxious that the Americans should not secure a Concession over the Koweit portion of the Neutral Zone without P.C.L. having the opportunity to make a bid for it. In 1936, when their representative Major Holmes had visited Koweit with a view to obtaining an option for the area in question, the Sheikh had declined to negotiate with him; but he had told Major Holmes that, if l\e were to change his mind, he would be inclined to prefer a Company in which there was a substantial British interest to one which was wholly American. ^ Mr#. Skliros believed that this represented His HighnessjMl sincere opinion./'X opinion. If therefore Mr. Rhoades was going to Koweit to negotiate for a Concession, P.C.L. would also wish to send a representative ^ there; for this purpose they would probably select Mr. Lermitte, now at Bahrein. They contemplated that the terms of the Concession would be similar to those obtained by C.A.S.O.C. in respect of the Saudi area of the Zone. If P.C.L. were successful^ they would approach C.A.S.O.C. with a view to the formation of anoint Company for the exploitation of the Zone as a whole. ^ Mr. Skliros added that P.C.L. was a British Company and about 22$ of its capital was British. A considerable part of the remainder was American, which should help to reconcile U.S. opinion if P.C.L. were to secure the Concession. Mr. Peel recalled that the Sheikh had informed Major Holmes in 193 ^ that if he were to modify his refusal to open negotiations he would act once advise P.C.L. accordingly. He had since been reminded of this promise, and we would be prepared to take steps to see that it was observed. The Sheikh however had consistently declined to open negotiations with anyone; in this he was probably influenced by the possibility that on the death of Ibn Sand he might be able to bring the whole of the Zone under his own sovereignty. The Sheikh had maintained this attitude when Mr. Rhoades had visited Koweit in 192+0. (Here Mr. Skliros^interpolated that Mr. Rhoades had put it about that the Sheikh hadTpromised to grant the Concession to the American Company). We had just heard that the Sheikh had stated that he would not discuss the question of the Neutral Zone with Mr. Rhoades or anyone else. We were proposing to pass this on to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company in the hope that Mr. Rhoades would cancel his journey. If he did so it would be unnecessary for P.C.L. to send anyone to R&lt;weit. If he did not, P.C.L. would be informed. Mr. Bridgeman confirmed what Mr. Skliros had said about American ambitions in the Middle Eastern Oil Areas and their use of the H open door'* doctrine. He thought that HriwA these ambitions were partly due to the fear that the domestic oil resources of the U.S. were in danger of exhaustion. He also mentioned that the Eastern Gulf Oil Company belonged to the Mellon ^roup of .Companies, whose political influence was in the ascentl**\(In these circumstances he was apprehensive that, if we were to pass on the Sheikh's moftsege to Mr. Rhoades just as it stood, it would be interpreted in the U.S./IX If (hi.)

Dear Mr. Peel, I write in connection with the oil rights over the Kuwait Neutral Zone, of which a half share belongs to the Shaikh of Kuwait. The rights over the other half, belonging to H.M. Ibn Saud have, as you know, already been allotted to the Standard Oil Company of California. We have for a long time past been endeavouring to acquire the Shaikh of Kuwait’s rights over the territory. You instructed us in April, 1936 that our efforts must be limited to an option; but by your letter of June 14th, 1939 to me you intimated that no objection now existed to our applying to the Shaikh for a Concession. The acquisition of this concession would normally have found a place in our 1939/40 winter programme. As it is, you will appreciate that war conditions restrict our activities considerably and make it less easy to despatch a senior representative to the spot. Nevertheless, we are far from willing to let our candidature for this territory fail by default, and we have in the past been encouraged to consider ourselves as candidates acceptable to H.M.G. In these circumstances, we should be very grateful for your advice. If you can assure us that you would not concur in the grant of the rights concerned to any other party without our having been given prior notice and a fair chance to make our own offers, then we will gladly leave the matter as it now stands. If you cannot give such an assurance, do you think it desirable that we should make a forward move in thft naar future?

It might take the form of a joint company to be formed ad hoc as soon as the Shaikh has granted us his half-rights, the concession document containing provision for this. Alternatively - and a tempting alternative in view of the great difficulty anticipated in working in territory under divided sovereignty - the Foreign Office and your own department might agree to recommend to the two rulers a physical division of the Zone into two parts, to be attached to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia respectively in full sovereignty.

I enclose a copy of a letter of the 16th April from Bullard to Baxter, from which you will see that the Saudi Government are very anxious that the Neutral Zone should he developed and are inclined to think that the American and British interests concerned are obstructive. 3. We feel therefore that it might he a good thing if Petroleum Concessions Limited could induce the Sheikh to give them a concession in respect of his own rights in — 30 Z pi the Neutral Zone. An approach hy the Company to the Sheikh, even if unsuccessful, might make Ihn Saud think that we are as anxious as he to exploit the oil in the Neutral Zone. 4. In these circumstances, we feel that the R. T. Peel, Esq., M.C. /politicalpolitical difficulties which existed in 1956 have to a large extent lost their force and that it does not really make much difference whether petroleum Concessions the Sheikh, In fact, owing to the way Ibn Saud has tied himself up with the California Arabian Standard Oil the Sheikh seems an essential preliminary to the working of the Neutral Zone, 5. At the same time it seems that even if the Sheikh does grant a concession there will still be a lot of fences to jump. The next move would presumably be that Ibn Saud would grant a concession in respect of his own rights, either to the California Arabian Standard Oil by the Sheikh, or to some other company if they were unwilling. 6. If, as a result of all this, the Sheikh and Ibn Saud had given concessions to different companies, the next step would presumably have to be for the two Limited seek, or obtain, an option or a concession from Company (as we now know) the grant of a concession by Company if they were willing to cap the terms obtained /companiesfc. tm/u u* VU^^+X+A- ~ttA***4, companies to agree between themselves how the actual exploration and exploitation of the Neutral Zone was to he carried out. They might or might not decide to divide the area up between them territorially or, alternatively, to work through some joint organisation. But whatever they decided, they would probably have to arrange for the Sheikh and Ibn Saud to receive equal royalties and other profits, for it is, I suppose, improbable that these two rulers would agree to any territorial division which affected either their sovereignty or their financial prospects i.e. neither would be likely to agree to depend for his profits on a certain portion only of the Zone, which might prove better than the portion taken by his rival, but which might also prove worse. 7. It is, however, conceivable that the concessions might be obtained by the same company and this could happen in the following two ways, among others: (a) the Sheikh might grant his concession to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company who would presumably be willing to cap their own terms in order to obtain Ibn Saud r s concession. ((b)4-? (b) California Arabian Standard Oil Company might be unwilling to cap terms granted by the Sheikh to Petroleum Concessions Limited and Petroleum Concessions Limited might then succeed in securing the concession from Ibn Saud. It is also possible, at least in theory, that the Sheikh and Ibn Saud might grant concessions to companies quite different from Petroleum Concessions Limited and California Arabian Standard Oil Company. 8. The Foreign Office have in the past held the view, and still do so, that it is most important to get Ibn Saud every additional source of revenue we can. We therefore much hope that the Sheikh will be persuaded by Petroleum Concessions Limited to grant them a concession. We realise, however, that he may still refuse to do so. If we thought he would be any more likely to grant California Arabian Standard Oil Company a concession we should not, from the point of view of Ibn Saud 1 s interests, be sorry if he did so. But we know H flu.that, to other departments concerned, this possibility is most unwelcome and we have in the circumstances no /intention i\intention of suggesting that the Sheikh should he encouraged along these lines. We also refrain, out of deference to the views of the other departments, from pressing for the direct discussions between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh, wnich Ibn Saud has suggested, to be encouraged. In fact, it may be best to try to ignore this request, as it might only lead to the two of them agreeing to give California Arabian Standard Oil Company a joint concession. Equally, as we realise, it might merely confirm the Sheikh in his determination to sit tight in the hope that the whole of the Neutral Zone will one day come into his sole possession. I am sending copies of this letter to Starling and Jarrett.copy. (E 3534/68/91); No. o4/316/l. 1 L_ BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA t SAUDI ARABIA. April 16th., 1939. / y My dear Baxter, When Shaikh Yusuf Yasin was telling me about the Japanese inquiry concerning possible oil concessions (my telegram No. 3 saving of April 15th.), he mentioned the Kuwait Neutral Zone again. Fortunately de did not contradict me when I said that the Saudi Government had nothing there to sell to the Japanese or anyone else and that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company were entitled to wait until the Shaikh granted a concession lor his half of the oil rights and then to acquire a concession for the Saudi half at the same figure. But he showed even more keenness than ever that the oil in the Neutral Zone, if there is any, should be exploited, and talked much about the Saudi Gover nm ent 1 s desperate need of money, especially for armaments. The Saudis are developing persecution mania about their oil, and regard the American and British interests as in league to keep offers low. Yusuf Yasin asked whether anything could be uone about the Neutral Zone. I said that His Majesty* s put Government could not/pressure on the Shaikh, to induce him to grant a concession which he did not want to give. He seemed to think that direct talks between Ibn Saud C. W. Baxter, Esq. , M.C., Foreign Office. /andand the Shaikh might have a good effect, but His Majesty* Government might not approve of that, though it would have the advantage that we should no longer appear as the villain. I know how difficult this matter is, but we ought to keep in mind the King’s close interest in the matter, now that we are casting about for means to keep him contented in case of trouble elsewhere.

Nothing definite had been decided yet but he hoped that when the time came for an approach to the Sheikh we would be helpful to his Company, In such circumstances it seems improbable that the Calarabian Company will be prepared to relinquish thsir rights in Arabia for the sum offered by Petroleum Concessions Limited and we may see some lively bidding before the matter is finally settled, (3d)A.C.B.

My dear Baggallay, On further reference to their records the Saudi Arabian Legation found that the option is equally valid over the Central Area (up to the sedimentary and igneous line), as it is for the Kuwait Neutral Zone. I pass to you herewith a copy of the letter which we have today addressed to the Saudi Arabian Minister. If the reply is reasonably encouraging, we should expect to follow the matter up by negotiations on the spot. Yours sincerely, (Signed) H. Lacey Baggallay Esq. , Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.1PC. 48/125. 16th September, 1938. Excellency, ^ We have the honour to refer to recent conversations between yourself and your Staff and a representative of this Company, on the subject of Oil Concessionary Rights over those areas of Saudi Arabia over which such rights have not hitherto been granted by your Government. We have understood from you that these areas (or considerable parts of them) are already the object of certain right of preference or priority in favour of other parties, but that the existence of this does not debar our Company from making an offer to your Government for an Oil Concession over the areas concerned. It is, therefore, the purpose of this letter to convey such an offer to your Government through your Excellency, in respect of all areas of Saudi Arabia not already allotted to this or any other Company. These areas are hereinafter referred to as the 'additional areas', and include the two Neutral Zones - the one upon the Iraq and the other upon the Kuwait frontier - in so far as the sovereignty over these belongs to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We take this opportunity of remarking that our operations in the area covered by our 1936 Concession have not yet succeeded in locating oil in commercial - or indeed in any other - quantities, in spite of heavy expenses involved in these operations, in addition to the payments made to your Government; and at present, although our work is actively continuing, we do not feel that any considerable ground for optimism remains in that area. We are anxious for this reason, to extend our work into the additional area in the hopes of better fortune there. His Excellency Shaikh Hafidh Wahba, Legation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 42 Eaton Place, London, S.W. 1. It/R ? It appears to us that this could he best arranged to our common advantage by the cancellation of our 1936 Concession and the simultaneous conclusion of a new Concession Agreement between the Government and the Company, covering both the former and the additional areas in their entirety. The rights and obligations created by the new Agreement would then be identical for the whole area covered, and would run from the date of ratification; and they would be closely similar to those provided in the 1936 Concession. The only points of which the Company would ask modification of those terms owing to the new Concession covering a predominantly inland and remote, instead of a coastal and accessible, area, would be:- 1 . that the obligation to commence regular export of oil and to pay a high annual minimum Royalty should commence v/ithin four (instead of two) years after the discovery of oil in commercial quantities: and that these obligations should be conditional upon the oil discovered being of reasonably pumpable and marketable quality. 2. that the Royalty payable, while remaining at 4/~' gold per ton of oil of good quality and located reasonably near the sea coast, should be somewhat lower (according to a scale to be agreed with the Government and prescribed in the Concession) in the case of oil and high viscosity or located at a considerable distance from the coast. Tn consideration of the additional area covered, and of the modification of terms described above, the Company would be willing to pay under the new Concession the sura of £100,000 gold within one month of ratification, and the sum of £15,000 gold per year thereafter. If desired by the Government, the rent for the first two years could be paid in advance. If/If your Government, to which we beg your Excellency to pass these proposals at your convenience, finds them generally acceptable, and is in a position to conclude an Agreement with us on these lines, we shall be glad, without delay, to send to Jeddah a Representative empowered to deal with the Ministers of your Government in the matter.

The attached record of a recent conversatior between representatives of Petroleum Concessions Limited and Mr. Baggallay at the Foreign Office is of interest as showing the limits to which this Company are prepared to go in order to obtain oil rights in Eastern Arabia and in the Koweit Neutral Zone. 2. The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea Area (held by Petroleum Concessions Limited) or Hasa Area (held by the Standard Oil ' Company) is still uncertain. Information has recently been received, however, which points to the probability that the original concession Agreement (of 2?th May 1933) between the Saudi Government/o-overnment and the Standard Oil Company was subsequently ( 29 th May, 1933) modified by a 'Special Agreement' the effect of which is to accord to the Standard Oil Company - 'a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of Eastern Arabia (including Ibn Saud^ rights in the Koweit Neutral Zone) as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area (i.e. the Hasa Concession area) as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations”* On the same date as the conclusion of this 'Special Agreement” letters were exchanged by the Company and the Saudi Arabian Government defining the Company’s preference rights in regard to (a) the balance of Eastern Arabia not already covered by the Standard Oil Company’s Concession and (b) the Koweit Neutral Zone. The effect of these preference rights is to entitle the Standard Oil Company to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered to the Saudi- Arabian Government by another Company. If the Standard Oil Company elect not to exercise their right, the Saudi-Arabian Government is free to accept the other Company’s offer. Otherwise the Standard Oil Company’s preference rights continue at least as long as the conditions of the Special Agreement remain in force. 3* Last year Petroleum Concessions Limited stated that they were prepared to offer Ibn Saud £ 100,000 for oil rights over the areas in question but as will be seen from the record of the recent conversation they are now prepared to increase this offer to £ 200,000 in the first instance with an upper limit of £500.000 . Mr. Skliros apparently realises/7173 Wt 8900/111 10,000 4.38 Department.

Oil Concessions in Koweit Neutral Zone and Eastern Saudi Arabia. Similar letter sent to Colonial Office, Petroleum DepartmentSNCLO.UM &lt;N FOKK* , 9i , COVERING LETTER oaT COPY OF t r ^ 1 O^, J'i- j Oil Concessions l 1 953 j TTr^Uai' 'Arabia. 1 , T r. Skliros, Managing Director of Petroleum Concessions Limited, accompanied by Major Longrigg, called here this morning. 2. Mr. Skliros said that his company were anxious to try to obtain a concession for that part of Eastern Saudi Arabia not already covered by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company concession. He wished to enquire whether we had any objection to this and whether we had any more information concerning the preference rights of California Arabian Standard Oil Company over the unallotted area. It was his opinion that Ibn Saud would be very glad to give this area to a British company; he had also been assured by the Sheikh of Koweit that once the negotiations over the Koweit blockade were concluded, he was confident that he would be able to obtain the transfer to himself of Ibn Saud’s rights over the Koweit Neutral Zone* 3 . I said that we would certainly have no objection if Petroleum Concessions Limited made an offer for the unallotted area to Ibn Saud. As regards the preference rights, I thought that Petroleum Concessions Limited and ourselves were agreed that these rights amounted to no more than a right to cap any other offer; if California Arabian Standard Oil Company were not prepared to offer as good terms as another company, then the Saudi Arabian Government would be entitled to give the concession to that other company. We were not quite sure how far these preference rights extended, but I could tell him for his confidential information that they appeared to cover an area as far west of the Hasa concession areaarea as ’’the contact between the sedimentary and igneous 'formations', wherever that might be. I hoped Mr* Skliros was right in his belief that Ibn Saud would prefer a British company to take up the concession; but I pointed out that our present friendly relations were in danger of being compromised by differences over our policy in Palestine. I also very much doubted whether the Sheikh of Koweit’s optimism in regard to the Neutral Zone was .justified, unless he had something very tempting up his sleeve to offer Ibn Saud in exchange for his rights in that area. 4. Mr. Skliros said that he proposed to offer the Saudi Arabian Government £200.000 in the first instance; this sum would almost certainly be capped by California Arabian Standard Oil Company, but his company were prepared to go up to £500,000. He supposed that if our view of the preference rights were correct, a process of bargaining might continue till one or other of the competitors dropped out. 5. Mr. Skliros also said that he would now, as a first step, approach the Saudi Arabian Minister and ask for information as to the extent of the area over which California Arabian Standard Oil Company had preference rights. I asked that he would not allude, in conversation with Sheikh Hafiz W'ahba, to any information I had given about the geographical extent or nature of the America company’s concession rights. I also pointed out that as Sheikh Hafiz knew very little about this matter, it would probably be necessary to impress upon him the importance of taking up the matter with his government. Mr. Skliros said he would do so. He added that if Petroleum Concessions Limited made an offer for the unallotted area, it would at any rate have the effect of compellingcompelling California Arabian Standard Oil Company to come into the open and announce their intentions with regard to this area. 6 . In the course of the conversation, Major Longrigg mentioned that the results of the exploration of the Red Sea concession area had proved very disappointing. A further surveying party would be going out this autumn, but he had little hope of any oil being discovered. He also said that the ’’contact line between the sedimentary and igneous ’’formations” meant that the American company’s preference rights extended westwards across the Arabian peninsula as long as there was any oil-bearing i. e, sedimentary yf formations. Most of Sastern Saudi Arabia consisted of igneous formations, except for a narrow strip along the Red Sea coast. (Sd.) L. Baggallay. 30th August, 1938.'7 CONFIDENTIAL.

(j^ Mr.Longrigg opened the discussion 'by saying that there were three matters which he wished to raise, viz:- A. The position in regard to the Koweit Neutral Zone; B. The position in regard to the Bahrein Unallotted Area; C. The position on the Trucial Coast, etc. 2. With regard to A (the Koweit Neutral Zone), Mr.Longrigg said that as a result of our refusal to allow Major Holmes to act as their negotiator at Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast, Major Holmes had severed his connection with Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and the Company were afraid that he might now resume his connection with the California Company. Major Holmes was now at Koweit to consult with the Sheikh regarding the Neutral Zone and owing to his influence with the Sheikh they were apprehensive lest he might persuade the Sheikh to give the concession to American interests before Petroleum Concessions Ltd. ha.d been given a further opportunity of putting forward their proposals. Mr.Longrigg then went on to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government might see their way to discourage American interests, or at least to ensure that I'll i~ iitf the Sheikh did net cede his oil rights in the Zona until Petroleum Concessions Ltd. had been given a fair opportunity/opportunity of competing. H e was prcraised that the Company 1 s views would receive consideration♦ 3. With regard to B (the Bahrein Unallotted Area), Mr.Longrigg referred to his previous call on the 31st March, at which he had left a copy of the Company's draft lease relating to parts of the Bahrein Unallotted Area and he said that here again the Company were concerned about the future intentions of Major Holmes, who was fully informed as to their proposals. The Company were satisfied that there was little chance of the Sheikh of Bahrein giving them the whole of the Unallotted Area and that they had been led to believe that the Sheikh intended to give everything except the Hawar Group of islands to the Americans. For this reason they had departed from their original intention to compete for the whole of the Unallotted Area; but while they were prepared to leave the main island out of their plans, they wanted rather more than the Hawar Group and he hoped that His Majesty’s Government would feel able to support the Company on the basis of the draft concession. Sir Trenchard Fcwle intervened at this stage to point out that the Company's proposed concession area included certain islands (i.e. the Hawar Group and Fasht Dibal) whose ownership as between Bahrein and Qatar had not yet been clearly determined. While on the evidence at present available to His Majesty's Government these islands belonged to Bahrein there was reason to suppose that the Sheikh of Qatar might wish to advance claims to them and he thought that it might be preferable to ask the Sheikh of Bahrein to postpone the resumption of negotiations for a short period (say two or three months) in order that the question of ownership could be finally determined. This suggestion/2-0 1 3. suggestion had been put to Lord Cadman in a recent conversation and it was understood that His Lordship was agreeable. Mr.Longrigg said, however, that the Company were opposed to any postponement and he personally thought it would be a pity to put ideas of ownership into the mind of the Sheikh of Qatar. He pointed out, moreover, tha.t if enquiries showed that the islands in question belonged to x This seems x to be the the Sheikh of Qatar, they would be included in the case - In the Qatar concession which the Company had already obtained from that concession (Article 2) Ruler; and he said that by entering into negotiations with the State of Qatar is the Sheikh of Bahrein for them, the Company were merely defined as 'the whole running the risk of paying twice for the same thing. The of the area over which Company were prepared to take this chance and would the Sheikh rules and definitely prefer to carry on with the negotie,tions without which is marked on any postponement. Sir Trenchard Fowle said that he had the north of the line not appreciated the latter point and that in the circumstances drawn on the map attached he was inclined to withdraw his suggestion for postponing t o the Agreement.' the negotiations. Mr. Peel wound up t hi s part of the 19.4.38. d iscussion by s aying th a t th e views put fo rward on.behalf of th e Co mpany w ould be carefully c onsidered. an d t hg.t a decision would _be^j;iven_as_s oon as_j)ossib 1 e. 4. With regard to C (the Trucial Coast, etc.), Mr.Longrigg said that there were two separate points, viz: (1) Concessions; ( 2 ) Exploration. With regard to (l) (Concessions), the present position was that the Company had obtained concessions in respect of Lebai and Sharjah; but so far all efforts to induce the remaining Sheikhs to come into line had proved unavailing. As far as was reasonably possible, the Company had met the various demands put forward by the Sheikhs and he thought that fully adequate terms had been offered; but the SheikhsMS 4. seemed to be completely out of hand and appealed to be convinced that eventually they could get v/hateven terms they liked to asko A state of deadlock had been reached and the Company felt that unless His Majesty’s Government were prepared to intervene, the only alternative open to them was to temporarily withdraw their negotiators. Asked for his views, Sir Trenchard Powle said he thought that if the Sheikhs were left alone, for say six months, they would probably come round and accept the Company’s offers. Mr. Longrigg said, however, that in oil matters waiting usually resulted in bigger demands and he thought that delay in coming to terms might make it more difficult for the Sheikhs to withdraw from their present position. If, however, the Political Resident advised waiting, the Company would of course accept his advice, but they hoped that it would be found possible to do something to hasten matters. Mr. Lewisohn then asked if the Company could regar d their presen t privileged position as watertight and was i nformed that for t he present, at any rate , they had no need to worry on this score . Mr. Lev/isohn then went on to say that he thought that the Political agreement might have something to do with the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah's refusal to come to terms and ho asked whether His Majesty’s Government regarded it as essential to obtain the Sheikh's agreement. Mr. Longrigg agreed with his colleague and suggested that the terms of the agreement were sufficiently binding on the Company without bringing in the Sheikhs. Mr. Peel pointed out, however, that as two of the Sheikhs , namely Debai and Sharjah, had recognised the agreements, it might be difficult not to follow t h e same procedur e in the case of the others, but he promised t h at the que stion would be re-examined . As regards exploration, Mr. Longrigg said that from the Company's point of view, the present situation was completely/completely unsatisfactory. He said that although much of the territory concerned could probably be v/ritten off as valueless, some parts appeared to have definite interest and they must see it all. Up to the present the Company's efforts to visit certain ,f interesting' areas through the medium of the Trucial Sheikhs, had been unsuccessful and the Company had formed the conclusion that it would probably be best to leave the Trucial Sheikhs alone for the time being and to try and operate through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg mentioned in this connection that he had seen the Sultan during the latter’s recent visit to London and had been told that in addition to certain parts of Muscat territory, the Sultan might be able to arrange for a party to reach Baraimi (v/hich the Sultan claimed belonged to him) through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg said that this suggestion 33 erned to offer greater promise of getting something done and he enquired whether it might not be -possible for His Majesty’s Government to co-operate with the Sultan. H e was p romised that the point would be considered . 5. Sir Trenchard Fowle mentioned that during his recent conversation with Lord Cadman he had been asked to suggest the name of a suitable person to act for Petroleum Concessions Limited in connection with the forthcoming negotiations at Bahrein and Koweit, Sir T. Powle said that normally he would hesitate to give advice, but as the present circumstances were somewhat peculiar he was prepared to do so. The names which occurred to him were Messrs.Longrigg. Lermittc and Packer and he said that so far as the local Political authorities were concerned, all these gentlemen would be acceptable. He also thought that they would be acceptable to the Rulers concerned. A. C • B • S. INDIA OFFICE. 12th April 1938.i&gt;*S ROTAL LK0AT1 2f OF SAUDI ARABIA, LORX&gt;OK« 19th A rll»31»S8.

Mahmocd H. ;ada.Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, May 29th, 1933. Dear Sheikh Abdulla, Referring to the contract which has been signed today by you ' &gt;n of the Saudi Arab Government, and by the undersigned, on behalf of Standard oil Company of California, rela.lve to an oil conceeeion covering a portion of Eastern Saudi Arabia, I aa setting forth below the agreement we have also reached on behalf of the two parties to the same contract, which agreement shall be considered as a part of the said contract. For convenience, the two parties in question shall be referred to below in the same manner as designated in the said contract, naraely, the 'Government' and the 'Company', and the said contract shall be referred to as the 'Saudi Arab Concession”• 1. The* Company is granted a preference right to an oil concession covering a certain area described in Article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession. The preference right so granted the Company shall be a right to acquire an oil concession covering such area, exclusive of the so-called Neutral isone also referred to in the same Article 3, by equalling the terms of any offer * or such concession that may be made the Government by others xn good faith and that the Government may be willing and ready to accept. within thirty days after receiving from the Government written notice, setting forth in full the terms of such offer, the Company shall notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession by equalling the terms so offered. if the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to accept the offer made, but if an oil eoncessi n should not be granted to others on the same terms as those so offered and so presented to the Company, the prefer ence right of the Company shall continue, at least so Ion* as His Excellency the/ Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman A1 Haindan, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.the prorifsi no of Article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concesaion remain in force. 2. The Company's preference right to acquire an oil Canceasion covering the co*called neutral Sone referred to in Article a of the audi Arab Canceaei n, shall be a ri^ht to equalj with respect to the rights of thw Oovurnaent in the Keutral ;*cne, the teme and conditions which may be obtained by the nhei^di of Kuwait for a c^noeeslon covering hie ri&amp;frte in the lieutral lone. In the absence of any grant of an oil conceaslon covering such right© of the Sheikh of Kuwait# the Oovemaant will endeavour to reach an agreement with the Bheikh of Kuwait whereby the Company will be permitted to acquire an oil conceeflion covering thu rights of the Government and of the Lhulkh of Kuwait in the Keutral zone. In either of these two event©# the Company ©hall have a period of thirty days from the date it receives written notice setting forth in full the terns and condiU ns of the oil concession covering the right© of the She kh of Kuwait in the Keutrul ;„one# or covering the t erne of the propoaed concession embracing the rights of the Gov^maent and of the Ghelkh of Kuwait in the Neutral ^onu# as the case may be# within which to decide and to notify trie Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession on such terns. If the Company does not wish to do so# the rvov. xusaont is free to negotiate with others# but if the oil concession should not be granted to others on the sa e terns as those offered to the Company# the preference right of the company shall continue# at least so long a© the provisions of Article 7 of the Baud! Arab Coriceaslon remain in force. 3. The consent of the Gove naent must be obtained before the company shall have any right to examine the so-called Keutra ..one referred to in Article 3 of the Caudi Arab Concession. 4. The provisions of Article flb of the Gsudi Arab Concession shall also apply to this agreement•(K 3066/1036/91; The schecne of the arrangements seems to me to be as follows. under the Agreement of the £7th May f 1933 the uaucii Arabian Govern .ent receive to begin with a rent of ££&gt;,000 per annum (see Article 6 and Article 12: the nufrtoere throughout this note are as revised by the insertion of the three additional articles). Then when oil is discovered In commercial quantities tne rent eeaecg and the daudl Arabian Goveroraant receive a royalty (Article 14). 2. The Standard Oil Company, however, have to make to the Saudi Arabian Government a series of advance payments on account of royalty. The first of these is £50,000 (Article 4), which has to be paid at once. The second is a sum of £20,000 (Article 6), which has to be paid after eighteen months if the Agreement goes on so long. The third is £50,000, which has to be paid upon the date of the discovery of oil in commercial qua/.titles, and the fourth another £50,000 which has to be paid a year after this first discovery of oil in oommerfclal quantities (Article 11). 3. The procedure with regard to all these four advances is In substance the same. The company gets them back by deducting half the amount of the royalties otherwise due to the aovem^nt (Article 7 and Article 11). But there are various provisions unu«r which the contr iCt of concession may be determined at different times (Articles 10, 28 and 29) and therefore the parties had to arrange what w&amp;s to happen with regard to theue advances if the contract/contract «*a terminated before the company could recoup itself out of royalties. In tfce case of the first two of the&amp;« advances, Article 7 provides that the Government is to repay them in cash in four equal instalments and then goes on to say that, although the concession is at an end, the preference rights granted to the company under Article 3 shall remain in force until these advances have been repaid, as a sort of eecurity for the advances. (Curiously enough it is not provided in Article 11 whet happens with regard to the two later advances, which are only made after the discovery of oil in coraiercial quantities, if the contract is determined before they have been repaid. I suppose it was thought that this eventuality was not very likely to harr&gt;en). 4. I think, however, I can now answer the question which we have been considering. The preference rights under Article 3, as further explained by the letter to the Minister of finance, cannot be determined by the daudi Arabian Government unless the whole^c oncesslon la detormiaed. .Air thermo re, even if the whole concession has been determined the preference rights remain until the first two advances ere repaid. The preference rights are an integral part of the concession. It is quite clear that the baud! Arabian Government cannot get rid of the preference rights under Article 3 merely by repaying the fire* two advances. On the other band, we now see for the first time what these preference rights consist in and they are not rights which sterilise development in the ^reference sono. Any other coraoany// I 2 ,13 company may uiait* • tender for a oonee Baton In the preference aone anu then the standard Oil Company has tne right either of abandoning Ite preference or making an offer as good as that made by the other company. It la therefore clear that any other company can try to outbid the Standard Oil Company If it so desires. (Signed) W.l. BKCOW. 13th June, 1938.P.z. 3753/1938. s. 2291 / 1036 / 91 .

Sir Reader Bullard raised the matter at Jedda, but was unable to obtain the required particulars,although the impression he derived was that the information which you gave in your letter P.C.39/41 of the 23 th February last to Rendel about the American option was substantially correct. We have since been in communication with the Saudi Arabian Legation on the subject, who have provided us with some additional information, but it is not yet possible to form a definite opinion as to the extent of the California Company’s option or the conditions on which it may be terminated. The Legation are, however, making further enquiries and we hope to hear from them again before long. Meanwhile, I am afraid that all that we can say is that such information as we have hitherto been able to obtain shows that it*is at least arguable that the Saudi Arabian Government cannot free themselves from their obligation to the Company except by paments out of royalties ; but, as mentioned above, we are not ourselves sure of the exact position.

My dear Bullard, I enclose for your information a letter which Rendel received some time ago from Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Limited, asking whether the option which the Standard Oil Company of California had obtained in 1933 applied to the whole of central Saudi Arabia. 2. Rendel promised Longrigg at the time that we would ask you by telegram whether you could obtain confirmation of the information received by the company from Jedda, but by an oversight, for which I must take full responsibility, this was never done. 3 . I have, hov/ever, asked Zada whether he has the text of the option in London, since, as you will remember, it was proposed some months ago that the Saudi Arabian Legation should take legal advise as to the extent to which the option was binding upon them, and they could hardly take legal advice without providing their counsel with the actual text of the option. 4. I made it clear to Zada that I did not want to make any request which would embarrass him personally. He told me in reply that he v/ould willingly let me have the text if it was in his possession, but added that to the best of his recollection the Legation had, as a matter of fact, when the question first arose, not been able to obtain advice for the very reason that they did not have the necessary texts. 5 . I have heard no more from him, so I expect that he is still without the text, and is perhaps asking his Government to/zn to supply it. 6 . In the meanwhile Longrigg had heard from Hamilton of the California Arabian Oil Company that the option extends not only to the Kuwait Neutral Zone, but to all unallotted areas in Nejd. 7. If it were possible for you to obtain confirraation of this information the Company would be very glad to have it. (Sd. ) LACY BAOGALLAY.^GPY P;Z. 281 5 / 1 938. COPY. (E 1115/1036/91) PC. 39/41.

Mr, Loomis, wno is an agreeable and cultivated old man, rather of the same type as the lete Mr. Mellon, talked round the subject for u long time and kopt branching off into disquisitions on the activities of his Company in Borneo, Texas and other remote parts of the world. I finally asked him whether there was any point he particularly wished to talk over with me. He replied that there was nothing in particular, but that he merely wished to re-establish contact, and he then asked me whether tnere was any point which T would like to put to him. 5. The only question I could have out to him to any purpose would have been regarding the intentions oi his Company in respect of the Koweit Neutral Zone, and I thought it best not to show too great or too direct an interest in this particularly thorny question. I therefore said that there was nothing in particular, but after some time led the conversation Pace to the operations of his Company in Sauai Arabia, and mentioned in passing his Company’s option on the neutral zone. Beyond saying that his Company ware not operating there and in fact oould do nothing without first getting a concession from the Sheikn of Koweit, Mi', Loomis did not pursue the subject. I gathered that the/tae prospects of finding oil in Nortb-liiastern Saudi Arabia were no brighter than they had been wnen I visited flasa last March, and I took the opportunity to tell Mr. Loomis that X understood that the Koweit Oil Company had hitherto been equally unsuccessful in Soweit. 4.

The £100,000 (gold) cash down and £15,000 (gold) annual payments offered had primarily for object the obtaining of a footing in the Neutral Zone, and I made it quite clear to the Minister that hie Government’s Neutral Zone rights were an integral part of the proposal. I am willing to negotiate for 'the rest”, but I feel that in the circumstances I should trim the offer to the extent of the £60,000 that had been included for the Neutral Zone, the new terms being say £75,000 (^old) on signature, and £12,500 (gold) rental per annum. Two years 1 rental could be paid in advance, producing an immediate sum of £ 100,000 ^gold; or £164,250 sterling in round figures on to-day's rates. I experience considerable diffidence in myself proposing to Hafiz this reduction, but if you could indicate to him that the original offer still stands if they deliver half rights to the Neutral Zone, I am ready to resume negotiations on these lines; my diffidence is lest he should think that I am going back on a promise, a thing that is not done in the best businesQ circles, but perhaps some preliminary preparation by you on the part that the Neutral Zone played in my offer, would make him take more kindly to the revised proposal.

Since Rendel’s letter of the 28th July to Skliros we have heard only from the latter that he has had a further talk with Sheikh Hafiz Wahba on the 29th July and made the modified proposal which forme the subject of his (Skliros*) letter of the 27th July to Rendel. Sheikh Hafiz was not perturbed and said that he would immediately telegraph this new offer to Ibn 3 aud. 3. Sheikh Hafiz also told Skliros that Ibn Saud was taking legal opinion in London as to the extent to which the Saudi Arabian Government was tied in the matter of the option given to the Standard Oil Company of California.

In other words the Shaikh feels tmt tne territory which now comprises tne present Keutral Zone, and which was rightfully nis, was wrongfully given away by His Majesty’s Government to ibn Saud by tne Ojair Treaty of 1922. partner, that 0 n the death of Ibn Saud - ne is of course a far older man than tne snaikn, tne latter hopes - snould Saudi Arabia crumble away - to regain nis 'lost provinces' for nimself. It would appear immaterial to consider what if any basis tne Snaikn nas for nis grievance against nis Majesty’s Governmant over tne Ojair Treaty. The fact remains that ne nas this grievance. This being so, and in view of nis refusal in May 1936 to discuss the question of neutral zone Oil with Petroleum Concessions Limited (vide Kesidency Printed letter No. 460-s of the 1st June 1936), we nave no reason to expect that nis reaction to any proposal for re-opening this question will be enthusiastic. 3* with regard to (b) . Personally i am of opinion tnat any sucn pressure would be both undesirable and ineffective. I quite appreciate of course His Majesty’s Government’s policy at tne present time to do wnat is possible to assist tne improvement of tne financial situation of Saudi Arabia# At tne same time we can /1 . z ? * -3- cat nardly expect tne Snaiicn to appreciate tnis argument in tne same lignt. I tnink he would reel that ne was being pressed to sacrifice what he regarded as his own interests lor the bend it of a Government - that of Saudi Arabia, which was doing its best to ruin his State by a blockade, and tnat this pressure came irom a quarter - nis Majesty** Government - which was definitely pledged to protect him and look after his interests# moreover, while he would doubtless have no objection to Saudi Arabia increasing a financial resources, it would be somewhat difficult to convince nim why any assistance in this direction which his Majesty’s Government wished to offer should be at his expense, ana riut theirs, In the question of his hate Gardens in Iraq and in that of the Saudi Blockade the Shaikh has already two grievances against His Majesty's Government# I am aware of course of the efforts which his Majesty’s Government nave made, and are making, in connection with both these questions, but from the Shaikh*s point of view the fact remains that th&lt;$r are unsettled, ne has a third grievance in the matter of the Ojair Treaty, and any pressure from his Majesty’s Government in the matter of .Neutral z»one Oil would give him a fourth and - in my opinion - a legitimate one. kurtner- aore it is by no means at all certain tnat his Majesty^s Govern- ment would gain their object by 'pressure*, since the Shaikh - if he felt strongly on the subject - would remain firm, and his Majesty's Government would then be in the unfortunate position of having aroused the Shaikh's resentment without gaining their object. In fact a situation might come about not unlike that envisaged in paragraph 3 of my ifixpress Letter ao.B/9 of the 24th May 1935 on the subject of pressure in connection with Kuwait - Iraq Smuggling# 4 # The above are my replies to the two specific points on which my views have been asked. I should like, however, to make the /-4- tne following further conmente# l*he scnerne proposed by Petroleum Concessions Limited seems to me an excellent one. 3/ ii Saud will be free of nis commitments to the standard Oil Company of California, whose place will be taken by a partly British Canpany ~ Petroleum Concessions Limited, and tne finances of Saudi Arabia will benefit. The Shaikh of Kuwait will of course also benefit since he will share equally with Ibn Saud tne proceeds of any Neutral Zone concession granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited. The main reason why he may hesitate to participate in the proposed arrangement is that - as already explained - ne has hopes some day of regaining the whole of the neutral zone for himself* While strongly deprecating anything in the way of pressure on the Shaikh to ^ome in* on the present arrangement there are various cogent arguments which we can use with him in its favour. In the first place it could be pointed out to the Shaikh that the Kuwait Oil Company so far nave found no oil in Kuwait territory in spite of deep boring, and though of course they will not give up without further trials, wnicn will take some years, it is possible that they may not strike oil at all. If unfortunately this should occur the prospect of oil being found in the aeutral Zone would diminish, as would tne termstne Company were prepared to offer for the latter* as for nis recovering the whole of tne Zone on ion Saud’s death the latter f 8 demise might be many years still in the future. Imam Yanya of Yemen, though some eleven years older tnan Ibn Saud, is still going strong, and even when Ibn Saud dies it is by no means certain that things would take a turn which would restore the Zone to Kuwait. In other words a bird in hand is worth two in the bush, and unless tne Snaikn is very set in his attitude arguments on these lines should I think prove eff ect ive. 5. mere is another aspect of this question? as a first rate bargaining /D- 2 3r X 3 u bargaining counter against tne Saudi Blocicaae. nere 1,8 somev^ing, i.e. exploitation of oil in tne neutral ^.one, whicn (pres) Ibn Saud wants but whicn tne Snaikn, tnougn ne may eventually agree, is not particularly keen about• me possioxa-.t&gt; ti.ereiore of linking tne Snaikn*s assent to tne oil agreement uo xOn saad f 3 assent to calling oil tne blockade mignt be considered. 6 # Vi/itn regard to tne next step to oe taken i venture to suggest that tne Foreign Oil ice - as I understand tney are doing - mignt continue to explore Petroleum Concessions Limited’s proposal witn tne Saudi autnorities, and to ascertain if tne latter are prepared to accept it - at all events in principle. Ii i or any reason tne Saudi Government are not prepared to consider tne proposal tnen ooviousiy cnere is no object in our approacning tne Snaikn. Tne latter (vide my telegram ^ o»7a9 oi tne 29tn July 1937) is leaving Kuwait in a few days for -bigypt, and will return in the middle of September v/nen perhaps tne reaction of tne Saudi Government will be known. 7* With regard to certain points discussed by Captain de (iaury in his Express Letter quoted above# nis paragraph. 2 .

The shaikh 9 s attitude, suiaaed up, is that the neutralizing of this zone was a hurried expectant - a compromise - made against the wishes of the then young Ruler of Kuwait on his behalf by His Britannic Majesty’s aoverniaent, and that he hopes one day to recover his full rights in it. In order to appreciate the shaikh’s attitude Lorrimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Vol.2, page 1061 should bo studied to,-ether with any map, showing the former boundaries of Kuwait under the Anglo-Turkish Convention, such as the -far Office G.S.G.S.ioap ho.3869 a (1933) of ,9 (e) Air Routes, (b) Islands in the Persian Gulf and (o) Boundaries of Kuweit end Trucial Area*. 2./2,a Joint Qoncessiak Keferenoe para 5(b) of the India Office Jbcpress Letter. The Shaikh would ask how, in the event of a Joint concession can the half rights of sovereignty of both Rulers be sustained? How would security, recruiting of labour, appropriation of lands, and a judicial rights over the Arab and other eciployees be exercised? is impossible to give bin any satisfactory answer - and that it is impossible to devise any agreement acceptable to all the parties concerned on the lines of the agreements we already know, such as the Kuwait Oil Company agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait. The bhaikh of Kuwait has already pointed this out and would if we pressed him to give way and grant a joint concession, do # so again. 5.(a) Another Course . The only course seems to be that either Saudi Arabia or Kuwait should be asked to cede its half rights in the zone, receiving however half all the emoluments and royalties which may at first or any time, up to a limit of so inany years, accrue from the operations of the Oil Company in the area formerly the M Neutral up his half rights in the zone of his free will. Ibn Baud is in quest - and urgently - of monev. of a successful outcome if Ibn b his half rights to Kuwait and the bhalicn were asKea to sanction in exchange payment to Ibn baud of half all the I think that it may bo at once decided that it Zone. The Shaikh of Kuwait will certainly never give There would thereforeall the Initial and aubsequent gains from the Oil Company up to the limit of 00 many years* The grazing rights of Saudi tribes could be specifically protected and agreement reached tin t those at present taxed by Ibn Saud could still be taxed by him* something like the machinery mentioned in Articles 9 and 10 of the Saudi Iraq Bon Voisinage agreement might usefully be employed in case of dispute in this connection, and might be embodied in the contemplated Jaudl~Kuwalt Bon Volsinag* Agreement. (b) Advantages to the &gt;;Iral;vh. It could be pointed out to the Shaikh thet he would have gained hie great point,sovereignty over the Neutral Zone, which would in future be within the bounds of Kuwait. The Treaty of UJair (19S2) refers to front!ere and the limits of the Neutral ^one, and &gt;ouid in this respect of course have to be superseded. All concessions, other than for oil, within the zone would of course be the Bheikh f s to give, and further that in the end he has much to gain by a rich and strong Saudi Arabia, which is within the present policy of His Majesty’s tfoveraoent and therefore should be his too. In addition he and his people would of course gain inmensely by the labour employed and contracts given by, and sale of produce to, the Company. (o)Ibn viand* To Ibn Baud it could be pointed out that he gains his main object, cash. In any caso, whichever coapany exploited the Neutral Zom would be compelled to demand the right to operate through Kuwait and use predominantly Kuwait labour and other resources. They ouuld not be expected to work through say Baa Tanoura 150 miltse to the ~outh when Kuwait is only 50 milen away. Joint sovereignty during exploitation seems unworkable an&lt; even if the Shaikh of Kuwait were forced by His Majesty’sHis Majesty’s Government to agree there would be every likelihood of continual disputes as to rights, making for embittered relations all round, which he, Ibn Saud, will no doubt willingly sacrifice much to avoid* 4»A Third Possibility* Another possibility ifrich occurs to me is that both countries should hand over the exercise of their rights within the zone to a third party, either His Britannic Majesty’s Government or the Oil Company. This seems to me to have objection on political grounds* One can imagine the protests there would be and the kind of headings and articles that Iraqi and Indian newspapers would have: rt Britain begins her penetration of Holy Arabia”, 'Eastern Nejd a British Colony” and so on. Moreover it has, I think, in our Imperial experience usually been found unsatisfactory to place sovereignty, or powers which in this case would be tantamount to it, injto the hands of a Company. 5* Conclusion. Of the three courses it therefore seems to me - I have not of course had the benefit of knowing your views - that that given under para (3) above is the most likely to lead to a satisfactory conclusion. If that course were taken and Ibn Baud were to agree to it in the principle then presumably the order of events subsequently would be:- (a) Negotiations of concession with the Shaikh of Kuwait by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., 'should Neutral Zone become Kuwait territory”: (b) Anglo-Saudi agreement with regard to the Southern frontier of Kuwait. This order/This ordar would be desirable ia order to onaure, the territory having become y^rt of Kuwait, that the 3 haikh did not then delay in the granting of the Concession. (Sgd.)

It will be remembered that Petroleum Concessions had offered Ibn Saud the sum of £100,000 gold for rights over his entire territory excepO^^j those parts of it which had already been granted to other concessionaires. This area would have included the Kuwait Neutral Zone and it was proposed that Ibn Saud should pay to the Standard Oil Company of California out of the £100,000 whatever sum was necessary to release him from 4136b 1000 10.35 Office was about to inform the Saudi Minister that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. v/ere prepared to make this offer and that the Company was one which H.M.G. could commend. A minute has now reached/ -reached us written by Mr.Rendel and dated 20 th July, in which he records a conversation with the Saudi Minister on that date. It appears that the negotiations with Mr.Skliros of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. led to no result, as it turned out that King Ibn Saud was unable to free himself from the option held by the Standard Oil Company of California merely by the repayment of the cash advance. .both the Minister himself and Sheikh Yusuf Yasim ha^t been mistaken on this point. Thus the Saudi Government were unable to accept Mr.Skliros’ proposals for rights over the whole of the territory of Saudi Arabia not covered by existing oil concessions, since that would have included the Neutral Zone. 2.

But Sheikh Yusuf had been mistaken on this poiJit, and the California Company appax'ently could not be bought out by the nere repayment of the debt. This meant that the Saudi Government were unable to aeoept rm flrltrse *i proposals for rights over the whole of the territory of &amp;audi .rabia not covered by any existing oil ooneessions, since an integral part of that proposal was that theaeutr&amp;l sons, in so far as Ibn Baud's rights were concerned, should be Included.

I am most grateful for the detailed account of our telephonic conversation, and I must apologise for not having made a full record of that conversation myself, as I quite agree that it is very relevant. 2 . There is only one point on which I think I may perhaps have given you a false impression. I gathered from Mr Skliros that his proposal was that the £15,000 a year should be paid for the rights to take up oil concessions in any Saudi territory in respect of which oil concessions had not previously been granted. But it would not be a part of a concession. If oil were j_ound, I gathered that it would then be dealt with on the !*&amp;sis Ox a new concession, the terms of which would correspond exactly to those of the concession which Petroleum Concessions Limited already holds.

Department. 415b :«ooo 10/31 Please see the papers at P.Z. 3821/37, and in particular the letter from this ( ffice to the oreign Office dated the 2nd July. Since that letter was written (and indeed before it was v/ritten) there rave been farther developments and a number of conversations between I r. Rendel, of the Foreign Office, ana Petroleum Concessions Ltd., which have resulted in che Company, as a result of pressure from I.r* Rendel, making an olfer to the Saudi Government which |would have the effect of enabling Ibn Saud to buy out tre Standard Oil Co. of California from the option which they have from him m respect of his oil rights in the neutral zone. We did not hear anything about these conversations until the eveniiig of 7th July, when Mr. Rendel (as recorded in his note of that date) telephoned to say that he was proposing to see the Saudi Minister that evening and to pave the way with him for P.C.L. The note I made of this conversation is at flag A (above P.Z. 3821/37). Anything which enables money to be put into Ibn Saud’s pocket at the present time is, of course, to be welcomed, and so is anythingwhich II.M.G. may be able to do to assist him (particularly m view of the publication of the Palestine Report); but, as was mentioned m my note of 25th June on P.Z. 3821/37, it has hitherto been nhe policy of H.M.G. not to do anything to encourage development of the neutral zone, and it is quite obvious that any development of it will involve great difficulties and potential causes of friction, in view of the equal sovereign rights which Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit have in the area. 1 oreover, the Sheikh of/I of Koweit has consistently hitherto refused to consider • • any oil exploitation in the area, and it is thought that he hopes at some future date (e.. ., on the death of Ibn Saud) to acquire full sovereignty over the neutral zone for his own State. ^ ‘iiupnose thftf vm-a^ S (O' f he bheikh Tiinv*n Mimri Pimb 'it p^ x v~'iT. ii^ iiPil boon hitihi?rto .. i.. seethe zone dovolope-d, and^ it will be a matter for careful consideration whether, and how far, H*M.Gr. should exert pressure on him to fall in with an^ scheme which may be produced for a joint concession to be granted to P.C.L.

Rendel, 'sn., C* .G., FOREIGN OmCE.Copy (E 3487/2440/91) r Oil in Koweit Neutral Zone . Mr.Longrigg, of Petroleum Concessions Limited having called on me to discuss another question this morning, I took the opportunity to ask him whether he was familiar with the question of the Koweit Neutral Zone. On his replying in the affirmative, I asked him whether nothing could be done to reach an agreement with a view to facilitating the development of the oil resources of this area. 2. I gave him a brief explanation why we were anxious to see these oil resources developed. 3. Mr.Longrigg explained that the option which had been granted by Ibn Saud to the Standard Oil Company of California did not constitute an insuperable bar to exploitation. According to his information, the option only held good so long as King Ibn Saud did not repay to the Standard Oil Company of California the £50,000 advance which they had made to him. It would then be open to Petroleum Concessions Limited to pay this sum to King Ibn Saud in order to enable him to repay this debt and they would then be free to obtain a direct concession from him in respect of his rights over the zone. Ibn Saud had, however, asked for £100,000 and, as the concession would still have to be negotiated the Company thought that this price for the Standard Oil of California’s present option was much too high. 4. I then asked whether the obvious alternative was not for the two Companies to try to combine to exploit the zone jointly. Mr. Longrigg entirely agreed, and said that this would as a matter of fact suit everyone. Negotiations had/2* S I had in fact been begun with this end in view, and had very nearly succeeded. Unfortunately - and he now wished to speak quite confidentially and asked that his name might not be q.uoted if the matter were referred to again - an unexpected difficulty had arisen at the last moment from the American participants in Petroleum Concessions Limited. As I was no doubt av/are, the American 23.75^, holding in Petroleum Concessions Limited was held by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and the Standard Oil Company of New York. These Companies had been in negotiation in the United States with a view to a possible combination. Negotiations were well advanced when largely for personal reasons, a complete breach occurred, and the Standard Oil of New Jersey v/ere now on very bad terms indeed with the Standard Oil of California. As a result, the Standard Oil of New Jersey v/ere objecting to any attempt on the part of Petroleum Concessions Limited to come to an agreement with the Standard Oil Company of California for the exploitation of the Kov/eit Neutral Zone, and negotiations had been suspended. 5. I asked Mr. Longrigg whether he thought that Lord Cadman could do anything to help. Mr. Longrigg said that, if v/e were anxious to secure the early exploitation of the Koweit neuural zone, he thought it might be well worth while taking the matter up with lord Cadman personally. At the same time, he was doubtful whether Lord Cadman would be able to overcome tne personal oif±iculties which had developed between the Standard Oil of New Jersey and the Standard Oil of California. 6. I gathered that Mr. Longrigg v/as fairly hopeful cibout the prospects of oil in the Koweit neutral zone, though he emphasised that the area was small - much smaller, for example,/A Z SZ Z5 U n | example, than Qatar. I said that size did not seem to be a necessarily decisive factor, since Bahrein, which was far smaller than the Kov/eit neutral zone, had now turned out to be one of the best oil fields in the Middle East. 7. I derived the general impression that Petroleum Concessions Limited would be very glad to exploit the Lowe it neutral zone, and would rather do this by means of an agreement with the Standard Oil of California than have to pay £50 or £100,000 in order to acquire the latter Company’s existing option. Mr. Longrigg emphasised that it was unlikely that there would be any difficulties from the Sheikh of Kov/eit, or from Ibn Saud, who both of them appeared ready to agree to reasonable conditions about royalties etc. (Sgd. ) G. Rendel. 24th June s 1S5 7,I 6 $ r K0V2IT T 1 EUTRAL -LOm OIL \ Lord CadiTian cane to see me about this at 10 this morning. I briefly explained the position, and emphasised our anxiety to ensure that any oil resources in the Koweit neutral zone might be developed as early as possible. I explained that, for political reasons, we were anxious to ^o what we could to help Ibn Saud to remain prosperous and independent, but that at present his great difficulty was finance, since 3 audi Arabia possessed practically no sources of revenue other than the x^iIgrimage, the revenue from which was of course totally inadequate. In these circumstances, if the I.P.C. could see their way to taking some forward step over this question, either by buying out the Standard Oil of California 1 s oiDtion, or by combining with that Company for the exploitation of the zone, it would be all to the good. Prom the purely British point of view, of course, we should very much like to see the I.P.C. working any oil there might be. Lord Cadman began by saying that there could be no question of buying the Standard Oil of California’s option. This would be simply paying blackmail, particularly as the . concession would still have to be negotiated. As regards combining with the Standard Oil of California, it was difficult to say quite how far the personal considerations about which Mr. Longrigg had spoken were entirely genuine. Negotiations were still pending, since the standard Oil of California were having great difficulties in marketing their Bahrein oil, and Lord Cadnan’s organisations might be prepared to do a deal on the basis of giving the standard of California certain marketing facilities. This might perhaps offer an opx^ortunity of coming to some arrangement about the Koweit neutral zone. Lord Cadman would look into the matter personally to see whether • • •X/ 5lf whether anything could he done - hut of course oil still * had to he found in the zone, and the Kov/eit Oil Company 1 s recent exr^eriences in Koweit, where they had had to close down their operations on the north side of Koweit Bay, were rather discouraging. The Company were now starting work in the southern area of koweit, and this might provide a better indication of whether any oil was likely to he found in the neutral zone. (oigned) G. . Rendel. 29th June, 1957.2./ \ 2. 55 £°i^: (E 3778/2440/91) Oil in Koweit Neutral Zone As arranged with Lord Gadman, hr. Skliros of Petroleum Concessions Limited came to see me this morning. Ke said that he had been informed of my previous conversations with Mr. Longrigg and Lord Cadman on this subject, and that he understood that we were anxious that petroleum Concessions Limited should take any action it could to secure the early exploitation of any oil in the zone in order that Ibn Saud, whom we were anxious to assist for political reasons, as being the ruler mo 1 : t worth helping and maintaining in Saudi Arabia, might obtain some advantage from the royalties. He understood therefore that we wished the Company to come to an arrangement with Ibn Saud to take over the California Company f s option. Although the position was rather obscure, he understood that this could be done by repaying to the California Company the loan of £50,000 v/hich was the consideration for which they had obtained their option. Ibn Saud would derive no benefit from this, since he would only be exchanging one creditor for another, but he would then be suit of his commitment to the California Company and free to give a concession in so far as he was concerned to Petroleum Concessions Limitedn j IZ~ 2. I told Mr. Skliros that I had understood from my previous conversations that his Company were not at all inclined to pay this sum, and would prefer to come to some agreement with the California Company for the joint exploitation of the zone. Hr. ikliros denied this. He said that his Company would certainly not v/ish to combine with the California Company, who already had fear too great an interest in the development of Arabian oil. Their interests would almost certainly have to be bought out in time, and it would pay Petroleum Concessions far better to dispose of any rights or claims which California Company might have by a capital payment at the outset than to do anything which would extend the California Company’s sphere in Arabia and increase the expense of eventually buying them out. Oil generally (i.e. outside Arabia) had lately been doing very well and the sum involved was not a large one. It was therefore quite possible for Petroleum Concessions Limited to repay the £50,000 to acquire the option and negotiate a new concession with Ibn Saud, who had indeed indicated that he would prefer to deal with a British Coi pciny and did not want to get too tied up with the California Company. But there was no evidence to show that there really was any oil in the neutral zone. Had the California Company’s operations in Hasa proved successful, this would have indicated more likelihood of oil in the neutral zone and matters might have been different. As it was, the California Company had only found a few pockets of oil in Hasa. It was of excellent quality, but there were not yet any indications of a large or important structure. The Koweit Oil Company’s/0-5^ Company’s operations in Koweit had oesnequally unsuccessful. They had drilled a well of 8,000 feet on the north side of the hay, but had only found small indications of oil in quite unremunenative quantities. They were now drilling south of Koveit, and, if they found oil there, it might be an important indication of oil in the zone. But there was nothing to go on as yet. Mr. Skliros then gave me an interesting account of the oil position in the rest of Arabia, which I am noting separately. 3. Mr. Skliros then asked whether, if his Company went forward with this proposal, and spent £50,000 on taking over the Standard Oil Company’s option, there was anything which His Majesty’s Government could do to help them. 4. I said that I wished to make it clear at the outset that, although we should welcome anything they could do to help Ibn Saud, and should like to see them operating in the Koweit neutral zone, we could not take the responsibility of influencing them against their own commercial judgment. It might well be that the whole transaction would prove entirely unremunerative, and if they had then acted on our suggestion, they would no doubt regard us as partly responsible for any losses they incurred. 'we clearly could not take such a responsibility. Mr. Skliros said he quite understood this, and that any decision which his Company took would be taken entirely on their own responsibility, and on commercial grounds. What/What Mr, Shliros meant to ask v/as whether there was anything we could do to ensure that petroleum Concessions Limited got the concession from both the rulers concerned, 5, I replied that, as regards Ibn Saud, it seemed to me that, in view of the fact that he said he wished to deal with a British rather than a purely American company, and would already have arranged for the transfer of the option, there ought to be no insuperable difficult.y, particularly in view of his anxiety to obtain as soon as possible any royalties that might be available. We could not, however, exercise any pressure on him, and the Company would have of course to make their own terms with him. As regards the Sheikh of Koweit, His Majesty’s Government were in a position to exercise more effective influence. Apart from the fact that, if Petroleum Concessions Limited held an option or a concession from Ibn Saud in respect of his rights, the Sheikh could not give an effective concession to anyone else, he was in / fact very dependent on His Majesty’s Government and we could probably give him a very strong lead. Moreover, we could veto his grant of a concession to anyone else, provided this did not lead to threats of reprisals from foreign interests, as had happened in the early days of the first American application for Koweit itself (Mr. Skliros said that he thought that this situation was now most unlikely to recur). I explained, however, that the Sheikh of Koweit was not always easy to deal with, andam was a little inclined to try to play off the various rulers, Governments and interests with whom he had to deal against each other. (I mentioned this in reply to a question hy ICr. Skliros v/hether the Sheikh of Koweit might not be anxious to grant the concessions to Petroleum Concessions Limited in order to please Ibn Saud). On the other hand, if Petroleum Concessions Limited really wanted to obtain a concession from him, I thought that it ought to be possible to do a good deal towards inducing him to grant it. 6 . Finally, Mr. Skliros asked whether the matter was urgent. I said that it v/as urgent in the sense that Ibn Saud badly needed money, and had in fact asked for our help in trying to secure the exploitation of the Lowe it neutral zone. Mr. Skliros said that it would be difficult to negotiate in Jedda until October, but that something might possibly be done through the Saudi Minister here. I said that I thought this would be worth trying, particularly as Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was still here and would be available between his return from Scotland on about the 10th July and his departure for Arabia on about the 15th July. 7. Mr. Skliros said that he would put the matter before his Board at their meeting to-morrow, and let me hear within a day or two what they had decided. If they decided to go forward with the matter, he would propose to get into immediate touch with Sheikh Hafiz Wahba with a view to pursuing the matter with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin early next week. (Signed) G.W. Rendel. 5th July, 1937.2. U r copy :L_J (E 3778/2440/91) K oweit Neutral Zone Oil. Having discussed this question with Mr. Starling of the Petroleum Department and with Mr. Clauson of the India Office, to both of whom I gave a fairly detailed account of all that had passed, and having found them both strongly in favour, in principle, of Mr. 3 klir»os , proposals, I raised the matter with the Saudi Minister this evening. I reminded him of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin's conversations with Sir Reader Bullard, as recorded in Jedda despatch No. 59 of the 10th April (E 2440), and [ told him that we had ever since been giving the matter our earnest attention. We had now found that there were likely to be great difficulties in the way of arranging for the Standard Oil Company of California to secure an effective concession from both rulers over the Kov/eit neutral fcone; but, as a result of our consideration of the matter, a new proposal has now emerged which might provide a way out of the difficulty. I understood that the Standard Oil Company of California had received its option in consideration of a loan which it had made to King Ibn Saud, and that, if this loan could be repaid, the King might be able to get clear of his obligation towards the Company. Sheikh Hafiz confirmed that this was so. I said that I now understood from Petroleum Concessions Limited/Limited, who, as Sheikh Hafiz knew already held a concession from Ling Ibn Saixl for the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, that they had a proposal to make which would enable King Ibn Saud to discharge this debt. I told Sheikh Hafiz that Petroleum Concessions Limited (which was the Iraq Petroleum Company in another form) was a British company of the highest standing, although it did contain certain foreign elements, and that His Majesty’s Government would certainly view with favour the grant of any concession to it. Sheikh Hafiz entirely agreed as to the standing of Petroleum Concessions Limited, which already held a concession from King Ibn Saud, and confirmed that King Ibn Saud would prefer to give a concession to a British company of this character than to an American concern. I then said that, if Sheikh Hafiz thought that the King would like to consider the proposals which Petroleum Concessions Limited wanted to put forward, I thought that it would be well for him to see Mr. Skliros of that company in the near future, since it might perhaps then be possible to come to some preliminary understanding while Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was still in this country. After some further discussion. Sheikh Hafiz V/ahba said he would be very glad if I would arrange for Mr. Skliros to make an early appointment with him for a preliminary discussion prior to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s return from Scotland at, or about, irth July. I am pursuing the matter on these lines with Mr. Skliros. (Initialed) G.V/.R. 7 th July. 1937 .r COPY (E 3778/2440/91) Z i Kov/eit Neutral '.one Oil. Mi'. Skliros telephoned this morning to s ny that he had of P.O.Ltd. buying out the California Company’s option on the neutral zone, but the Board had shoY,n great reluctance to interests vvith the California Company. In their view, it making an attack on a sister Company. ■/hat they now proposed therefore was to make an offer to parts of it which had already been granted to other concessionnaires or were already covered by previous concessio but the neutral zone . This would mean that they would obtain exclusive rights over the whole of Saudi Arabia with the exception of the Eastern stretch already granted to the Standard Oil Company of California (i.e. all the territory east of the Dahana - the S-shaped belt of sandy steppe country dividing Nejd from Hasa). Petroleum Concessions Limited already hold a concession over the v/hole of the west coast. For this they would pay to Ibn Saud a sum of £100,000 gold in cas.i, ouo of which he would have to settle with the Standard Oil of California in order to get them to release him from their option over the Koweit neutral zone. Mr. Skliros said that Ibn Saud was certainly free to do this, if he repaid the California Company the debt he owed them, and that he did not think this debt amounted in fact to as much as £50,000 ciiscussed this matter with the Board of Petroleum Concessions Limited yesterday. He had himself at first been in favour would be far better for Petroleum Concessions to acquire the option as jpart of a general deal , rather than appear to be Ibn Saud for rights over hi s entire territory, excepting those Petroleum ...Petroleum Concessions v/ou^-d further pay to Ibn Saud £15,000 gold per annum for five years for these rights, and v/ould be prepared, if he pressed them, to pay the first t\/o years in advance. If oil were found it would be exploited on the basis of the terms contained in petroleum Concessions Limited’s existing concession for the Red Sea coast of Saudi j.rabia, i.e. on a basis of 4s. gold per ton etc. The only provision of that concession which v/ould not be applicable v/ould be that regarding a pipe line, since, while it would be easy to build a pips line to the coast from any point in the western area where oil might be found, it would-be far more difficult to do so from Central Arabia. The point of these proposals as regards the Kov/eit neutral zone was that the zone would be included in the general deal, and Ibn Saud would have to settle with the standard Oil of California direct in respect of their option (which Mr. Skliros was convinced lie could do), and that petroleum Concessions Limited would not be brought into direct conflict with the California Company over a small secondary area. Mr. Skliros suggested that I should now explain to Sheikh Hafiz Yvahba, with reference to Ibn Saud’s appeal to us to help him to secure the exploitation of the neutral zone, that petroleum Concessions Limited were prepared to make him a comprehensive offer under which considerable sums would become payable to Ibn Saud at once in cash. He suggested that I should not go into details with Sheikh Hafiz, but tell him that if the Saudi Government felt inclined to consider such proposal Mr. Skliros would be glad to get into direct touch with him, and negotiate a concession here, leaving any further discussions or arrangements to be dealt with by Mr. Longrigg at Jedda in the au tumn.! r r. Rendel telephoned yesterday evening to say that ' r. Skliros of Petroleari Concessions Ltd. had informed him that the Company had decided to offer £100,000 gold to Ibn Saad for oil rights over the whole of the Saadi territory in respect of which oil concessiors had not hitherto been granted, including the Saadi rights m the Koweit Neutral Zone. The idea is apparently that out of this lump sum Ibn Saad would be able to take sufficient money to pay off the Standard Oil Co. m respect of the option which they hold over Saudi rights m the neutral zone. I understand that the Company further propose to seek a concession from Ibn Saud on terns which would include payment of £15,000 per annum for the first five years. T 'r. Rendel was seeing the Saudi Finister yesterday evening, and was . oing to inform him that he understood Petroleum Concessions Ltd. were prepared to make this offer, and that the Company is one of which F.L.Cr. approve and which they can comr end to the Saudi Government. I r./2^1 2 j\oS !'r. Rendel asked whether the India Office would have any objection to this. I said that we should certainly welcome any proposal winch might have the effect of putting some money into Ibn Saud’s pocket and that we should quite agree with his proposal to tell the Saudi Government that P.C.L. is a company of which H.iil.Q. approve. I suggested, however, that it was important not to say anything which would give the Saudi Government the impression that the Sheikh of Kov/eit would necessarily agree to the oil exploitation of the neutral zone by an y oil company- I pointed out that hitherto both the Foreign Office and ourselves had been averse from encouraging exploitation of the zone, that possibly this policy might have to be reconsidered if there was a prospect of helping the Saudi Government to ease their • aJT faliud' financial position, but that th* Department was £***4r€ unable to commit the Secretary of State to any proposal which would involve putting pressure on the Sheikh to induce him to agree to the exploitation of the zone.To Chairman Under Secretary Secretary of State...

The Kuvvait heutral Zone is, of course, the area V immediately south of the Sheikhdom of Kuwait, in which Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kuwait enjoy equal rights under the Kuwait-Wejd Boundary Convention of 1932, until such time as, through the good offices of a further agreement is made between the two rulers concerning it. There are no settled inhabitants of the zone and • there has hitherto, therefore, been no need for any form of governmentel administration. The question of oil in the Neutral Zone has been more or less active for some years, but the question has been 'dominated by two factors - ( 1 ) the grant by Ibn Saud of an exclusive option in regard to his rights in the zone to Standard Oil of California, (3) the reluctance of the Sheikh of Kuwait to consider the grant of any oil concessions in the zone, due to the fact that he hopes, on the death of Ibn Saud, to bring the whole of the Neutral Zone under his own sovereignty. Ibn Saud has for some years been anxious on financial grounds to secure the exploitation of oil in the Neutral Zone. The matter was discussed with Puad Hamza in London in 1934. The record of this conversation is at P.Z.6315/34 (flag 'A'), In that discussion he was informed that if the Standard Cil Company of California, or any combination to which they would agree, could put forward a firm proposal to the Sheikh of Kuwait, that proposal would be considered on its merits. H.M.G. have themselves been quite glad to see the unallotted zone stay undeveloped since, although they would be glad to see Ibn Saud helped to get a little more money/u.oney, the difficulties inherent in finding some system ol administration, protection, etc., (-which, of course, would be necessary in the event of oil exploitation) would be very considerable. Moreover, they were not anxious to see an American Company extending the area of its operations in Arabia, and the Standard Oil Company’s option gave them a stranglehold over any British or quasi-British Company which might wish to compete. A further complication was introduced 18 months ago, when Petroleum Concessions Limited ( the company practically equivalent to the Iraq Petroleum Company, which is negotiating for concessions throughout the Persian Gulf at the present time) asked for permission to approach the Sheikh of Kuwait for a concession on an option in the Leutral Zone. Permission was granted to them to approach the Sheikh for an option (the difficulties and complications which would be involved in their trying to get a concession having been pointed out by the Foreign Office and realised by the Company themselves). Actually, the Company failed to get an option from the Sheikh, but His Highness said that if and when he desires to open negotiations in regard to the Beutral Zone he 'would let •4 // Petroleum Concessions Limited know first . The Sheikh of Kuwait is, therefore, under some moral obligafion to Petroleum Concessions Limited to give them the first refusal in respect of his rights in the Heutral Zone, while Ibn Saud is definitely committed to the Standard Cil Company in regard to his rights. We have now had from the Foreign Office a letter, dated the 26th May, forwarding a despatch from B.L. Minister at Jeada, in which he reports that the question has again been raised by the Saudi Government. ~i~ mfirrufl Sir Header Bullard’S, refei**«*»s to the 1934 discussions ( of which he has already reminded Sheikh Yusuf Yasin) and he says that he does not see that there is anythingMinute Paper. ^4? l Department. f (** C. 3. to be done but to repeat the statement made to Fuad Hamza in those discussions. The Foreign Office, however, their letter go m0 further than this and seem to imply d , i that since it is of paramount importance to do Slirthing Ihm&lt; to help Ibn Saud to get more money, it is desirable (a) to tell the Saudis that we have no objection to Standard Oil approaching the Sheikh of Kuwait, and (b) if they do do so, to exert our influence on their behalf with a view to getting some agreement between the rulers and the Cil Companies concerned,^to enable the Heutral Zone oil to be exploited. The Petroleum Department in their letter of the */ 12th June traverse the Foreign Office proposals which they suggest are contrary to the fixed policy of H.H.G. ( to discourage American enterprise in Arabia and the Gulf) arid are unfair on Petroleum Concessions Limited. Mr. Symon’s note of the 1st June (which was written before the Petroleum Department's letter) gives the arguments against the Foreign Office proposals.

The Marquess of Zetland sees no reason to dissent from Mr. Secretary Eden's proposal, as set out in para. 3 of that letter, which appears to' be substantially identical with the proposal made by H.K. Minister at Jedda, namely, to repeat the statement made by Mr. Rendel on September 25th, 1934. Lord Zetland, indeed, is in full agreement with Mr. Eden that it is most desirable not to give King Ibn Saud any reason to think that H.M.G. are anxious to obstruct his interests in this matter. His Lordship does not, however, feel that H.M.G. would be justified in taking the further steps which it would appear that Mr. Eden is inclined to suggest. For instance, it would, in his opinion, be b ,-gra^«— to put any pressure ' on tp lr* * the Sheikh of Kuwait vnt-fr &amp; yicw^Ti 1 ^ fc i GT ^ fiioilit i.t irr^ l' 1 1 i i i t r \) nT p -1 '' 1 - Ln O' torri'tr'ii'j, 1 Iji wliruh lie iiao oqual-sov-erelg-ja r^i L Lts by an American or a liirxo^y A 111 (7 tii n (?

Such a proceeding would, in his view, be contrary to the )^tULe ) trend/ _trend of British policy in the Gulf and would cause considershle confusion in the mind of the Sheikh, and of the other Persian Gulf rulersjr^ for instance^, the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast, who are at present being pressed to grant oil concessions to Petroleum Concessions Limited rather than to the Standard Oil Company of California. Kor, in His Lordship's opinion, would it be proper for H.M.G. to advise the Sheikh to come to an arrangement with regard to the Neutral Zone, if His Highness considers that such a course would be contrary to his own interests. There is every reason to aifpose that this is, in fact, the Sheikh's view. Finally, His Lordship is by no means convinced that the possibilities of friction that would be involved in any arrangement to bring the Neutral Zone inter other administration and protection ^ 10 uP# not outweigh the advantages accruing n indirectly to H.ft.G. from such addition to Saudi revenues as might result from the exploitation of oil in the Neutral Zone. His Lordship would accordingly suggest, for Mr. Eden's consideration, that Pa rpx ! ,y#a t** the Saudi Government 1 -# ■■ i.* y o *' ; i fl {»r(iniPln P# should be •r that H.M.G. have no objection to any firm proposition being put to the Sheikh by the Standard Cil Company, hi it thrt noDraft Paper Department 3. indication should be given to them thet H.M.G. would exert their positive influence in favour of this Company.

In the event of any application being made to the heikh of Koweit on behalf of the i tandard &gt;il Company of California the Secretary Ibr dines is of opinion that it would be only right and proper for the Sheikh, in giving the matter consideration, to bear in mind the intereet ehown by Petroleum Conceaeione Limited in thia territory last year when they meae an application for an option and hie statementto their repreaentetive that while he ciih not wieh to enter into negotiations in respect of this territory, when he tieaireti to open negotiatione he would let the Petroleum Conce&amp;aiorui Limited known first. In this connection I aia to draw attention to ir. Pendel’s letter of the £Pnd April, 1936, to Claueon of the India Off ice in which he stated that H.M. C?overomant would much prefer that at that stage the Company should not negotiate an actual concession. This point was referred to in a letter from Petroleum Concessions Limited to the India Of lice da tec the 11th September, 1956. In view of the foregoing the Secret ary ior Lir**e attaches considerable importance to ensuring that Petroleum A ^ iti. , Con cess ions Limited have a full and time us opportunity of j Kv reopening their negotiations if it be found that the :heikh is after all prepared to consicer the grant of a concession to any Company over hie half interest in the Koweit Neutral 'one, especially a* the Coapanj^ have expressed their indention of returning to the charge »t a later oate in the hope that the Sheikh will have modified his position. fa regards the suggeation in paragraph 6 of your letter that there might poesibly be a joint arrangement betweenthe Standard Oil Company of California and Petroleum Conceauione Limitedf the information availahJe to the Petroleum Department would not lend any eupport this suggest ion. Nor could the Secretary for inf* a support the suggestion that the agency through which the exploitation ie carried out is of aecondary importance. A® your Department is aware there is a United State® interest in Petroleum Concessions Limited but there ia no British interest in the Standard Oil of California and the Secretary for lines feels therefore that H.M.

May I discuss this with you please ? The record of the 1934 discussions with Fuad Bey Hamza is at P.Z.6215/34 in the hound volume (Flag A). 2. From a perusal of the previous papers it would seem that hitherto all the interested parties (except perhaps Ibn Baud) have regarded ’’sterilization of the Neutral Zone” as the best policy and the reopening of the question nay produce all kinds of difficulties. 3 . I have always been given to understand that it was part of the policy of H.M.G. to prevent, if possible, any extension of the activities of Standard Oil in the Gulf area. That being so the tone of the present letter from the Foreign Office is rather surprising. 4. A£ain the previous papers suggest that H.M.G. have been opposed to pressure being put on the Sheikh of Kuwait to enter into negotiations regarding the Neutral Zone. In this connection it will be noted that in the penultimate sentence of para.4 of the Foreign Office letter there is a veiled hint that it may be desirable to persuade the Sheikh to co-operate in the exploitation of the oil, if any, in the Zone. 5. The Sheikh’s attitude in the matter is that he has no intention of granting a concession for his half interest in the Neutral Zone to anyone so long as Ibn Saud lives. His policy was to sterilize the area. I understand from Captain de Gaury that it is extremely unlikely thnt the Sheikh will alter his view. 6 . nT hen considering the reopening of this question it must be borne in mind that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. were given authority in December 1935 to apply to the Sheikh/Sheikh of Kuwait for an option over his part interest in the Neutral Zone. The negotiations on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. were conducted by Major Holmes The result of the Company's application is contained in the translation of the letter dated 25th May 1936 addressed to Major Holmes by the Sheikh, see P.Z.4372/36 (Flag B). As you will see the Sheikh infoimed Major Holmes that he did not wish to enter into any negotiations in respect of the landing question. The Sheikh went on to say, however that when he desired to open negotiations he would let ^-ajor Holmes know first. I f we now agree to let Standard Oil approach the Sheikh we may have difficulties with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. In this connection it must also be remembered that when Standard Oil began to show an interest in the Trucial Coast and Muscat they were informed that H.M.G. regarded Petroleum Concessions Ltd. as having priority and that they could not approve of a rival entering into the field. 7. I presume that the Admiralty are interested in this question, but it does not appear from, the Foreign Cffice letter that they are being consulted.In any further communication this subject, please quote ** No. E 2440/2440/91, and address— not to any person by name but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 3481 Foreign Office. S.W.l. 26th May, 1937. 20^ Sir, H % • I'i •' - With reference to the letter from this department of the 4th October, 1934, (E 6018/4/25) enclosing a record of discussions with Fuad Bey Hamza regarding the Koweit Neutral Zone oil question, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Marquess of Zetland, a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda reporting a conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in which the latter raised the question of exploiting any oil which there might be in the Neutral Zone and inquired whether His Majesty’s Government would have any objection to an application being made by the Standard Oil Company of California to the Sheikh of Koweit for his rights in the Zone. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin no doubt assumed in making this enquiry that if the application were successful, the Standard Oil Company would receive a joint Saudi Arabian-Koweiti concession, (or at least option) for the zone as a whole and pay to the two Governments in equal proportion such royalties, taxes etc. , lid V as the concession or option might entail. ; : ° I . . » ' 2 q &lt; ! 2. Mr. Eden considers that the reply of His Majesty s Lii ^ I C - l Government to Sheikh Yusuf Vasin's enquiry should he as “S ,1 S3 sympathetic as possible. It is important that King Xbn Saud ^ i Q l v ^ 01 - ~ should increase his financial resources and with them the § 04 g * stability of his kingdom. It is equally important that his c •'* ^ 1 Majesty’s Government should not appear to stand in the way of any o KLi The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. ‘AY 1937 - t OrFVC - COPY SENT BY AIR MAILany plan which offers a chance, however small, of increasing those revenues. These, in his opinion, are the paramount considerations and outweigh any objections which might normally be felt to extending slightly the area in Arabia already covered by concessions granted to American (or disguised American) oil companies. 3. Mr. Eden accordingly proposes, subject to the concurrence of Lord Zetland, to instruct Sir Reader Bullard to inform the Saudi Arabian Government that so far as His Majesty^ Government are concerned there is no objection to their inviting the Standard Oil Company of California to approach the Sheikh of Koweit in regard to his share in the oil rights in the Neutral Zone. 4. This answer would naturally carry with it an obligation on the part of His Majesty’s Government to refrain from using their influence with the Sheikh of Koweit to dissuade him from acceding to the Standard Oil Company’s application. But Mr. Eden realises that unless the Sheikh has altered his views since he told the Political Agent in 1935 (see Koweit telegram No. 99 of 10th April, 1935) that he had no intention of granting a concession for his half interest in the Neutral Zone to anyone so long as King Ibn Saud lived, no dissuasion is likely to be necessary. Ihe problem may, on the contrary, be to persuade him to cooperate in the exploitation of the oil, if any, in the zone. But, however this may be, the first step that is required is to show good-will to the Saudi Arabian Government by indicating that their nominees are free to approach the Sheikh of Koweit. 5. In making this proposal, Mr. Eden does not overlook the interests of Petroleum Concessions Limited. Prom the point of view of King Ibn Saud and - from the wider political angle -angle - of His Majesty's Government the important desideratum is that the Neutral Zone should he adequately tested for oil and the oil exploited if found, and that King Ihn Saud should receive half the royalties and other benefits to he derived from this exploitation. The agency through which the exploitation is carried out is of secondary importance and if an approach hy the Standard Oil Company of California to the Sheikh of Koweit led indirectly to an arrangement whereby the Standard Oil Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited agreed to share between them a concession granted jointly by King Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, (or even to an arrangement whereby the Standard Oil Company dropped out through being unwilling to cap, as required by their option, the terms offered to the Sheikh of Koweit by Petroleum Concessions Limited), such an arrangement would be acceptable to His Majesty's Government and, presumably, to King Ibn Saud. Should Petroleum Concessions Limited, be unwilling, however, to offer such favourable conditions as the Standard Oil Company, and should the Sheikh of Koweit be unwilling to grant an option or concession on less favourable terms, it would probably be desirable that His Majesty's Government, if they exercised their influence, should exercise it in the direction of persuading Petroleum Concessions Limited to leave the field clear for the American company. 6. A similar letter is being sent to the Petroleum Dep artment. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,(23^) Copy (K 2440/2440/91) v British Legation No. 59 J edda x ^67/81/24) . 10th April, 1937, Sir I have the honour to inform you that Shaikh Yusuf Yaein recently brought up the question of the possibility of exploiting any oil that there may be in the Kuwait Neutral Zone. I referred him to the meeting which was held at the Foreign Office on September 25th 1934, of which I supposed the Saudi Arab Government had notes made at the time by Fuad Bey, who was present, but he could only find M some notes in English’’ of which he could make nothing, so I informed him of the three alternative solutions which were suggested at that meeting from various sides. 2. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin then informed me (1) that the Saudi Government were anxious that the oil in the Neutral Zone, if there was any, should be exploited; (2) that they much regretted the option granted to the Standard Oil Company of California, but that they had been obliged to grant it, and for a very small sum, owing to lack of money; (3) that they had no area of equivalent value to offer the Standard Oil Company in exchange for the option: there was only the fcadi Sirhan and the Standard Oil Company did not want that; ( 4 ) The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., f.P. , &lt;4bc« , Ac. , Ac(4) that they would he glad to know whether His Majesty’s Government would have any objection to an application from the Standard Oil Company for the share of the Shaikh of Kuwait, 3. I was able to furnish a reply to the question about a possible application by the Standard Oil Company by quoting from the minutes of the meeting on September 25th 1934, In th^ course of a resum e of the position Mr. Rendel said : M If the Standard Oil Company of California, or any combination to which they would agree, could put forward a firm proposal to the Shaikh of Kuwait, the proposal would be considered on its merits. But there seemed no reason why the Standard Oil Company should wish to take the initiative in putting forward such a proposal, since they were completely safeguarded by the option and could comfortably wait until some other applicant put forward a proposal, when they could decide whether to cap it or not. M 4. Although this reply was ready to hand I undertook to inform you of the inquiry made by the Saudi Government. Bheykh Yusuf Yasin said that if His Majesty’s Government had no objection to an application by the Standard Oil Company in respect of the Shaikh’s interest in the oil, the Saudi Government would put pressure on the company to induce them to apply for the concession for the whole of the Neutral Zone. He said that the Company had made no proposal in this sense, but it is curious that the subject was raised while Mr. Hamilton, the London representative of the Standard Oil Co. of California, and other senior officials of the company were in Jedda. 5. It is clear that the Saudi Government want money very badly, and that they hope that in some way His Majesty’s Government can help them to exploit their share of the oil in the Kuwait Neutral Zone. They know what an awkward positionthey are in by reason of the option granted to the Standard Oil Company. But they do not know, as we know from a statement which the Political Agent Kuwait reported to the Political Resident at Bushire in his telegram No. 99 dated April 10th 1935, that the Shaikh does not intend to grant a concession for his half-interest in oil in the Neutral Zone to anyone so long as Ibn Baud is alive, nor that the Shaikh has since rejected an application for an option which was made by Petroleum Concessions Limited in 1936. 6. Just as it may not be a mere coincidence that the question should have been raised by the Saudi Government in the form described above at a time when senior representatives of the Standard Oil Company of California were at Jedda, so it is possible that there is some connection between the Saudi interest in oil in the Neutral Zone and their continued resistance about the blockade. That Ibn Saud might 'attempt to introduce oil and neutral zone into blockade negotiations as a bargain counter*’ was foreseen by the Shaikh two years ago, according to the above- mentioned telegram sent by the Political Agent at Kuwait on April 10th 1935. It is obvious that a bargain of this kind would not appeal to the Shaikh, who evidently believes that his position in regard to the Neutral Zone and to Saudi Arabia will change fundamentally on Ibn Baud* s death. Nor is there any reason why it should be attractive to Hie Majesty's Government, who have always maintained that the blockade is unwarranted and that Ibn Saud ought to enter into a trade agreement with Kuwait with no other inducement than the advantages to be gained from good relations and legitimate trade. 7. As I have said before I think it is to our advantage that Ibn Saud should find some fresh source of revenue; and if2, 4 if there were anything we could do to assist him to that end that was consonant with our own interests and with those of any territories with which we are in special relations we should I think not neglect to do it. Unfortunately in the present case I do not see that there is anything to he done but to repeat the statement made by Mr. Eendel on September 25th 1934 which I have already communicated to Shaikh Yusuf Yaein and to leave it to the Saudi Government to put pressure on the Standard Oil Co. of California if they can. 8 .

On the 17th May Major Prank Holmes, representative of Petroleum Concessions Limited, an offspring of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, presented to His Excellency the Ruler a draft option on a concession in the Kuwait Neutral Zone. His Excellency decided not to avail himself of his offer which he refused verbally on the 23rd and confirmed in writing on the 25th. In the short interval between the verbal and written refusal the Company’s effort was confined to an attempt to obtain a first refusal on the option but no satisfactory progress was made. Some momentary initial confusion was caused by the use of the word 'KHIAR' for ^Optiont' in the Company’s Arabic draft in place of the correct words ”HAQQ AL IKHTIYAR’', (KHIAR means ’’Cucumbers” from Afghanistan to Morocco). Major Holmes left Kuwait on the 31st of May, bound for the Trucial CoastGOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Department.

In paragraph 2 of my telegram No. 417 of £ 6 th May 1956 I expressed the opinion that the written refusal from the Shaikh which Holmes was working for, and which would have bound the Shaikh not to give an option to any other Company for 5 years, would have been agreeable to His Majesty^ Government. Unfortunately, as will be seen from thecopy of the Shaikh’s letter forwarded under my Printed letter No. 460-S of 1st June 1956, the Shaikh has not given this promise but has merely added to his refusal that should he change his mind he would let Holmes know first. So as far as the.P.C.L. are concerned therefore the Shaikh is free to give the concession to whom he likes, though under his (Signature) engagement / S. 44. MFP—367 S&amp;T—(M-508)—16-7.35—10,000. (Designation)- 2 - engagement with His Majesty’s Government he cannot do so without their permission, 3, With regard to the question as to whether the Shaikh has come to some private understanding with Ibn Saud in favour of the Standard On Company of California, raised in Foreign Office telegram No.59 of 5 th June 1936 to His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, I enclose herewith copies of Express letters Nos.C/208 and C/215 of 10th and 14th June respectively, from the Political Agent, Kuwait. The latter of these communica tions would seem to cancel the former but I do not know that the Shaikh’s veracity in oil matters is above tne usual standard of those concerned in this business, and in spite of his categorical statement to Captain de Gaury I am inclined to think that the various possibilities indicated in his speaking I am inclined to agree with Captain de Gaury* s views as summed up in his paragraphs 8 , 9 and 10 of his Express letter Bo.C/208 of 10th June 1956.To From Political Agent, Amrait • Political Resident, Bushire.

I am of the opinion that seme sort of understanding about the future of the Oil development of the Neutral Pon© my and almost certainly does exist between Ibn baud and via a vis Petroleum Concessions limited recently, i rom his several references at the same time to the excellence of his relationship just now with Ibn Baud *faich he did not wish to imperil, from Holmes* verbal reports to me of his conversa tions with the bhaiich iasaediately after they took place which pointed to the same conclusion. greatest need at tha moment is very large sum of money, not only to keep going but to mechanize his forces i-.n^ ^onu a » standing army and air force, in view of the fact that the impetus of fanaticism on which he has relied largely is now dying away and has recently, only just across the Red lea frero him, been shown to be helpless against a modem army. *hile *^9 Ibn baud, in the Political Agency the Shaikh of Kv»irait This I deduce from the irraness of the shaikh I am doubtful however of its na tire. On© may, I suppose, safely assume that Ibn baud’sAgency, held fortih at sonus length about the Americans having obtained the Hasa Concession not because he did not favour the British but because of the supineness of the latter. He would have preferred the British but their representative, whom he sent for in the hope that they would circumvent the American representative did not do so. Was that his fault he asked? He was always ready to treat with and to help the British, and British concerns, but they were difficult and would not help themselves or him. If this was a hint for a new approach, and the fact that it was said in the Agency seems to show that it was, one of the two following possibilities may be in the minds of two Rulers* 4. Possibility 1. That Ibn Baud suggested to the Bhaikh that the A.I.O.C. might be induced to offer him a very large sun of money down which would while not so avowed publicly be given on the understanding that he would cede his share of the Neutral -one to Kuwait and thereby abandon all claims to future royalties* Thus both he and the shaikh 01 Kuwait would benefit and the British Ooveminent would probably be not displeased. (If the Neutral Zone ceased to be half Saudi Arabia presumably any first refusals and options existing between Companies and Saudi Arabia for her share of Oil exploitation would just lapse). In any case Holmes came away from his last interview with the Shaikh with this id&amp; in his hoae at? a possibility that he mi^it suggest to his Company and it is interesting that it must have been put there by the bhaixch although not in so many words. Possibility 2. Is that/- 3 - Xb that suggested in the letter of the tteeretary of tttate for Foreign Affairs, it has some likelihood in that f my predecessor told me on ay arrival here that the Shaikh believes that jaerioan concerns are easier to deal with than the ^•I«O.G«(and its affiliated Companies)^ On the other hand the Shaikh is well aware of the embarrassment it would cause and I doubt if he would be so f irm or so pleased with himself a s he appears to be just now in this oounectlon unless there were son** happier and more profitable plan in Ms xzdnd. 5. The third possibility, ruling out an understanding with Ibn aaud, is that the uhalkh is holding to hie conception that when Ibn ^aud dies the border tribes will simply transfer their allegiance to their ancient leader the ah&amp;lkh of nuwait and that with little or no action on his part the de facto frontier of Kuwait will return to roughly what it was formerly i.e. that of the ^niglo-Turkish Convention Including the Neutral Zone. 6. In that case ho has only to bide his time and the whole Zone will be his. 7. On the other hand the chaikh while giving to me his raaeon for refusal as being the peculiar juridical nature of the .one also added that In any case if hr did wish to enter into negotiations he would certainly not give it away to the first comer, as Holmes seemed to think he should. 'I should let it be known to several British Companies”, he B&amp;ld. ”1 should tell Lord Lloyd and others n # he added* { x t will be remembered that Lord Lloyd # as the obaikh says, followed him to farla to have a final word with him this last summer). 1 8. Reviewing the whole affair I incline myself to think that the two Rulers have had a heart to heart discussion, have seen where their interests m^et and willwill keap in tcuok on the subject* Possibly they have no definite concerted plan upon which to act but that certain possibilities (1 and 2 above) were taken into review and may be pur sued 9 perhaps both at the same time one being played against the other. 9* The shaikh of Kuwait would of course reserve to himself the third possibility t which would suit him best of all* He would therefore be in no great hurry* Xbn oaud on the other hand undoubtedly is 9 in order to obtain ready money. 10# To sum up I should say therefore that the probabilities are that Ibn Jiaud and the shaikh of Kuwait have ooiae to a working agreement without a definite decision on any exact plan and that in any case the Shaikh of Kuwait would be inclined to play for time* He would be certainly against coming to an arrangement whereby an iimerican Company already working in Hasa should work the tfiole of the Neutral Zone, with its appearance of abandoning the wone, although It is just possible that he might be engineered into accepting the situation in exchange for continued good relations* 11, In the case of Possibility 1, the sura which Ibn ;iaud would ask as capitalized royalty on an unknown oil-field would presumably be staggeringly high but perhaps not beyond what the A*I*0*0* would pay* Political Agent, Kuwait.UOKgll^CTJUL. h.A &amp; 1 jL.X-l Politioal iigent, Kuwait.

Mr. Skliroe mentioned that the Gheikh of Koweit had apparently ’hardened”, and had finally informed Major Holmes that he v/as not at present oreoared to consider an ootion as regards his interests in the Neutral Zone. 2. The conversation turned on Major Holmes’ relations with the heikh of Koweit, Mr. Skliros evincing a little surprise that Major Holmes’ influence on the Sheikh was not as great as might have been expected. Major Longrigg said that Major Holmes was undoubtedly on very close friendly terms with the Sheikh, but of course the latter was not completely under his thumb. Mr. Skliros also mentioned a story told him by Ydlibi to the effect that Ibn Saud had received £50,000 from the California-Arabian Oil Company for the option given to them by him for his share in the Neutral Zone, and would be willing, for £1,000 from P.C.L., to return that £50,000 to the American company, get clear of his option and do business with P.C.T,. Both he and Major Longrigg thought this a very unlikely story. 3. r. ^kliros then said that he had had some sort of idea at the back of his mind that there might have been a possibility of the ownership of the Neutral Zone passing in toto to one or other of these rulers. Mr. Rendel explained briefly the reasons which gave rise to the Neutral Zone, i.e. arising out of tribal arrangements in that region, and said /thatthfit'there vas no likelihood of any such development as suggested hy Mr. Skliros. 4. As regards the Trucial Sheikhs, matters were rather hanging fire, and so far Major Holmes had not been able to conclude anything. He (Mr. Skliros) was not too optimistic about these Sheikhdoms. 5. As regards Muscat, the Sultan was still away in Dhofar, and so far Major Holmes had not been able to establish contact with him. 6. Finally Mr. Skliros said that with regard to their intentions in the Yemen, nothing had of course yet been done, but Major Holmes had written a very nice letter to the Imam recalling himself to the letters recollection, and generally paving the way towards further steps in that direction.

Unless the question in your second sentence is inspired by any positive indication in that telegram I think it extremely unlikely either that Standard Oil Company of California are actively seeking concession for neutral zone or that any understanding has been reached between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Foweit. 2. I have never had any indication here that the Standard Oil Company of California are active in neutral zone at present: in any case their interest appears to me to be to take up the option from Ibn Saud to block other competitors as long as possible and to see meanwhile what progress they make in Hasa. 3. i doubt whether Ibn Saud wishes neutral zone concession to go to the Standard Oil Company of California. He would probably prexer to jockey them out and fulfil the promise which he gave to Ydlibi in 1954 if Ydlibi can square His Majesty’s Government ana the Sueikh. In any case he would probably hesitate to approach the Sheik direct after what passed between Fuad and the Foreign Office later in that year. 4.

I enclose a copy of the draft option handed ire by Holmes. As mentioned in my Note, I am inclined to concur with Holmes and Arnold that at the present stage it is probably preferable for the Company to seek an option rather than a full-blown concession. My comments on such Articles as appear to call for remarks are as follows Article 4^ The right conferred is exploratory but as Article's clearly limits to the Shaikh* s interest in the territory any rights granted it follows that no work can he carried out without a corresponding grant from Ibr Saud. Arti cle 7. This allows for the starting of negotiations for a concession during the term of the option, and also permits a merger with irterests of any nationality. In this connection it would doubtless be desirable in informing the Shaikh that His Majesty’s Government have given permission to the Company to seek an option, to inform \ him, and also the Comnany, in the terms of .' v -A paragraph 6 of your telegram N 0 . 8 P 6 of the 7th / J.C.Walton Esquire,CP. ,?■€., V &gt; J The India Office, London. 4 MAY 19 36 INDIA 01 &gt;OElArticle IS 7th March 19o6 to the Government of India.

I am sending copies of this letter and of its enclosure to Metcalfe and de Gaury.IN THE. NAME OF GOD THE' MERCIFUL This is an AGREEMENT made at KUWAIT on the day of 19S6, corresponding to the day of 1855 Hi^ri between HIS EXCELLE'NCY SHAIKH SIR AHMED AL-JABIR AS-SUBAH, Knight Commander of the Most Eminert Order of The Indian Empire, Companion of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, THE] SHAIKH OF KUWAIT, in the exercise of his powers as joint RULER with HIS MAJESTY KING ABDUL AZI/-AL-SAUD, KING of SAUDI ARABIA, of the territory known as the NEUTRAL ZONE which is more particularly defined below, on his own behalf and on behalfof and in the name of his heirs and successors in whom is or shall be vested for,the time being the joint control of the NEUTRAL ZONE of the first part (hereinafter called T1 THE SHAIKH') and PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED a Company registered in Great Britain under the Companies Act,i929, its successors and assigns (hereinafter called 'THE COMPACT') of the second part.

If there should at any time be dis agreement as to the meaning or interpretation of any clause in this AGREEMENT the English text shall prevail. In witness whereof the parties to this AGREEMENT have set their hands the day and year first above written:- AND GOD IS GRACIOUS.P.Z.3081/36 The chief point which Major Holmes brought forward with regard to this area was that in his opinion the P.C.L. would be well advised to revert to the idea of an opt ion from the shaikh in regard to the Neutral Zone instead of a full blown concession which was the latest scheme. He thought that there would be considerably less delay in obtaining an option rather than a concession ? and also that in view of a future agreement with the California Oil Company with regard to the Neutral Zone the situation would be more fluid if an option were obtained rather than a concession. Mr. Arnold agreed with the idea of an option rather than a concession and I was inclined to concur. Both Major H. and Mr. A. were of the opinion that if the Neutral Zone were to be worked at all it would obviously have to be under merger between the P.C.L. and the Cali-LOinia Oil Company. 2. With regard to Ibnsaud r s commitment to the California Oil company Major H. made the interesting statement that about a year ago the brother of Ibn gaud* s Finance Minister told him that this commitment was limited to 40 per cent of whatever merger the California Oil Company came to with any other Company. That is to say, that if the P.C.L. offered to merge with the California Oil Company on terms of 60-40, and the California Oil Company stood up for more than 40 per cent, they would not receive Ibn gaud’s support. 3. Major H. gave me a copy of his proposed option for the Neutral Zone, on which my comments will follow. T.C.F. BU SHIRE 6th April, 1936.r / FOREIGN OFFICE ! [■&gt; (E 2184/260/91) 22nd April, 1936. April 20th about Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Koweit neutral zone. Skliros has now sent me a copy of his letter to you of April 21st. 2. I find that there has unfortunately been some delay in sending you copies of our most recent papers on the subject, and I now enclose (1) a copy of a record of a conversation I had with Skliros on this subject on April 17th, (2) an extract from a letter which Skliros wrote to me on the same evening on this point, and (3) a note of a further conversation which I had with Skliros on April 20th and which has obviously led to his letter of April 21st to you. You have already received, under cover of our printed letter No.E 1998/260/91 of April 17th, a copy of Ryan’s telegram No.46 of April 14th. 3./ M. J. Clauson, Esq. r MAIL.3 # You wi!J.l see that I made it quite clear to Skliros that there would be no objection from, the Foreign Office point of view to his going ahead with negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit for an option in respect of the Sheikh’s rights over the Neutral Zone, but that we should much prefer that he should not at this stage negotiate an actual concession, Skliros told me that his Company were quite prepared to act accordingly, and to postpone negotiations for an actual concession - and any eventual negotiations with the Standard Oil Company of California - until after they had obtained their option; as their option would be for five years this would give them plenty of time, particular ly as they were in no hurry to proceed with the development of the Neutral Zone* 4. Skliros added that he was not unhopeful of L iany new Company which might he formed hy Petroleum (3401 33k Concessions Limited to exploit the Zone. As Petroleum Concessions Limited already contain (as the Iraq Petroleum Company) a 23.75 U.S. interest, the effect of this would have heen to produce a U.S. majority holding in the new Company, to which Skliros’ Company naturally could not agree. But he was inclined to think that although the Standard Oil Company of California had exaggerated ideas as to the value of the oil in the Zone and had opened their mouths very wide at the outset, they might well prove more reasonable later on. 5. I think the present solution fully meets the point raised in Ryan^ telegram No.46, and there is there fore no further objection from the Foreign Office point of view to your authorising Petroleum Concessions Limited to go ahead. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gunn at the Petroleum Department, to Seal at the Admiralty and to Farrer at the Department of Overseas Trade.COPY (E 2067/260/91) 33? n-i n ; 2774 1 0 Q r; i [ i 'J O J C IL Q0MCBS31 ON IN A RABIA , gQWGi t Kautyed Zono ft At the end of a conversation wit i me thia morning on rh-j question of the proposed Saudi Ar-Man Red Sea Littoral 0*1 ooncession - which I am recording: separately ~ Mr* Skliros the Iraq Petroleum Cesapany raised he question of the pro posed oil concession in the Koweit Ne tral Zone 0 Ee explained that Mr* Ydlih had now infbrmed him th&amp;t he had actually acquired a eonee sion - or et any rat^ an option -» from Kiftg Ihn 8aud over • he Koweit Neutral Zone, in ao far as Ihn Saud'a own rights th rein were o ncernedo .

As regards Ibn Saud’s half rights, 70 learn from Mr. Jenson that Ydlibi is endeavouring to secure these from Ibn Saud on terms of which Mr.Jenson has informed us in outline. W* consider these terms, if correctly reported, to be exce?aively high and we particularly dislike the obligation to pe / large sums in gold, a metal of which wo have hitherto been at Le to avoid the mention in our dealings in Easter Arabia. The t 3rms apparently being offered by Ydlibi to Ibn Saud are much hi ;her than those vtg had proposed (if and when oll.owed to do so) t) offer to the Shaikh of Kuwait. We are, therefore, informing the Arabian Development Syndicate that we are not buj irs of the Neutral Zone rights which they may have obtained from Ibn Saud on exhorbitant terms involving gold payments; nor is Ydlibi directly or indirectly acting fer us in c mnexion with the Neutral Zone. 8.

Sir, Owing to the peculiar position of the Kuwait Neutral Zone, my Company finds itself forced to the conclusion that, instead of endeavouring to secure a concession from the Shaikh of Kuwait for his half of the rights over that territory, it will be wiser to confine itself to the application for an option. This accords not only with the recommendations which we received from our negotiator on the spot, but also with paragraph 4 of your letter No. Z.8856/35 dated December 12th, 1935. In view of the interest felt in this territory by the Foreign Office, owing to the half rights of H.M.King Ibn Saud therein, we have mentioned our change of intention demi-officially to Mr. Rendel of the Foreign Office and do not anticipate that any objection will arise from that quarter. We still refrain, however, from instructing Major Holmes, our representative in the Persian Culf, from approaching the Shaikh of Kuwait until you are able to assure us that you have instructed the Political Resident in the Gulf that no objection exists to the op ening o f. negotiations with the Shaikh.

No. 46. Your despatch No. 67. I find it difficult to express any confident opinion. 2. Agreement on lines of enclosure to your despatch would appear to constitute option with right to eventual concession rather than actual concession; it is not clear whether it v/ould bring into operation first alternative in Standard Oil Company of California's option described in my 3. Assuming however that proposed agreement would constitute concession within the meaning of Standard Oil Company's option acceptance by Standard Oil Company of equal terms in regard to Saudi Arabian Government interest would make deadlock more complete than ever; refusal would eliminate Standard Oil Company but in this alternative Ibn Saud might well consider YGlibi group had first claim. 4. Language used by Ydlibi group in discussion with Petroleum Concessions Limited (see enclosure to your despatch No.64) might be held to imply that they had disinterested themselves in neutral zone. This is by no means the case. Ydlibi told me this morning that Saudi Arabian Government had undertaken to give him concession so far as they were con cerned if he could produce letter from Sheik of iCo^eit also expressing readiness to grant it to Ydlibi group; as regards Koweit interest he professed to be in correspondence telegram No. 95 o f 1954with his associates with a view to obtaining s-uch letter from Sheikh; he had no clear idea as to how Saudi-Arahian G-ovemment proposed to answer Standard Oil Company of California hut I suppose they would hope to create situation contemplated in second alternative in Standard Oil Company’s option. 5. Although Saudi-Arabian Government themselves created present impasse by giving option to Standard oil Company His Majesty's Government subsequently engaged in friendly discussions with the former in September 1954 and had full cognisance of wish of Baudi-Arabian Government to give concession so far as they were concerned to Ydlibi group. 6. In these circumstances I am inclined to think that grant of concession by Sheikh to Petroleum Concessions Limited would complicate situation still further and put His Majesty’s Government in false position vis-a-vis both Saudi-Arabian Government and Ydlibi group especially as they have never excluded possibility of latter obtaining concession from Sheikh if Saudi-Arabian Government should succeed in eliminating Standard Oil Company and put Ydlibi in position of being able to make firm offer to Sheikh. 7. As no operations can be undertaken by Petroleum Concessions Limited in neutral zone under neutral concession or option until Saudi-Arabian Government are squared only effect of either would be to put them in stronger position to negotiate with other interests, it seems to me that option alone would suffice for this purpose. Alternatively their best course might he to treat with Ydlibi in first instance as they have already done in regard to Red Sea Concession; naturally anything he says would need to he carefully checked; he appears to have some pull here.£ Ui l iC&amp; 9 .iiii juJu p C* *X P*ii,ii679/19^6 ^uodwifce. aotli 19^6 19^6. 1 tiy dear nandel.

I should like to ask three questions, only the first of which concerns me directly but all of which have some bearing on matters within my province*- (1) In paragraph 9 of Walton^ letter to you of November 4th, he suggests a doubt as to whether the Kuwait Neutral ,.one is within the 'Red Line' Agreement. I have never seen t;iis Agreement but have been under the impression that the only areas in which it left the A. 1.0.C. free to act independently of the I.P.C. were Kuwait territory proper and the Farsan Islands. is this wrong or doubtful ?

I am afraid that they will be ueed to support the theory that our main object in that discussion is to do Ibn £aud down in order to get economic advantages in Arabia. This thesis is being boomed by Philby. He develops it in an article in the Egyptian Gazette of January 14th, which you have doubtless seen or can see in the Office. He supplements it in conversation and may presently do so in print by suggesting that Great Britain ie doing in Arabia what Italy ie doing in Abyssinia but more cleverly. In one conversation with me he coupled ray name with that of Benito itfussolini but when I begged him to substitute 'His Majesty 1 e Government in the United Kingdom * for mine he assented.

It nay be, therefore, that King Ibn Saud might resent the action of His Jajesty 1 s Oorernmeat in giving their formal approval to the present proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited, - i.e. in allowing the Sheikh of Kowe1t, who can with Fetroieum Concessions Limited on the basis proposed. 4. on the other head, tere Petroleum Concessions Li ited to acquire this concession, the result might be to prevent a further potentially important area in Arabia from falling under the exclusive cou.iercial control of an entirely non- British company. As you know, the b*eit neutral son© falls within the so-called Red Line agreement, so that the constituent groups of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and therefore of petroleum uoncessi&gt;as Limited, are precluded from competing individually for a concession therein. No other serious British company is likely to be able successfully to take up or exploit any concession in this area, and the only possibility of securing at least partial British participation in/in eueh an oil coneeasion therefore eeeaa to lie in the preeent proposal. The grant to ietroleua Conceaaione limited of a definite concession o er this area, Insofar aa hia own rights were concerned f by the sheilch of Fowait night indeed effectively remove the danger of the Standard OH Oomoeny of California ever obtaining an exclusive concession for thenieelvea over it, and the ultimata result night be aoae compromise between the two companies, which would bring about the termination of the present deadlock, ensure the effective exploitation of any oil that might be found in the zone, and, at the eaae time, prevent the area from falling un er exclusive American ooMereial control. 5. In all the circu istancee Bia ejesty’s Oovemoient are disposed to view sympathetically the present proposal of Petroleum concessions Limited, but before considering it further they wish to know whether, in your opinion, their approval of it would be likely to ro&amp;uee an adverse politic*! reaction from King Ibn ;aud. This aspect of the question is naturally of importance at a tU\e when so many delicate and difficult political questions are outstanding between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia, particularly in regard to the south-eastern, and to the Transjordan, frontiers of thst Kingdom. I shall be glad the ire fore if you will let me have a brief expression of your views by telegraph. I am, with great truth ana regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of ctate)Minute Paper Department. Legal Adviser, Please see the following flagged papers. (1) P.Z.7763/35 - Letter from Mr. Skliros of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., dated 24th October Letter to Mr. Rendel (also Starling and Seal) dated 4th November. (2) P.Z.8856/35 - Reply to Mr. Skliros* letter of 24th October, dated 12th December, 1935. (3) P.Z.759/36 - Mr. Skliros* letter of 30th January, 1936 enclosing draft concessions. (4) P.Z.1254/36 - Note of an interdepartmental discussion at the India Office on 21st February 1936. The gist of these papers is that Petroleum Concessions,ltd., (a company which is for practical ! purposes identical with the Iraq Petroleum Company) have * applied to H.M.G. for permission to negotiate oil concessions with the rulers of Bahrein (in respect of the portion of Bahrein not taken up by the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s concession, which covers 100,000 acres, i.e. somewhere in the neighbourhood of half the area of Bahrain) Muscat, the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms, and Koweit (in respect of his oil rights in the Koweit Neutral Zone, i.e. the neutral territory between the dominions of the Sheikh of Koweit and those of Ibn Saud, in which neither ruler can grant an oil concession without the co-operation of the other). Draft concessions in regard to each territory have been prepared by the Company, whose agent (Major Holmes) is at present in the Gulf, waiting to open negotiations with the rulers in turn. These draft concessions have been communicated to H.M.G. and are at P.Z.759/36 (except the Muscat draft, which is at P.Z./ no:; 9 5000 : 85P.Z.1635/36 - the Muscat draft follows, however, the same lines as the Trucial drafts and so may he disregarded for the present). fhe Drafts have been scrutinised in a preliminary way by the departments concerned (the Petroleum Department particularly) and appear to be prima facie reasonable, £rom the point of view of the Rulers concerned, as a basis for negotiation. They will of course have to be examined in the light of local circumstances by the political authorities in the Gulf and by the Rulers themselves. The Drafts fall into three categories (1) the Bahrein draft, (2) the Trucial Coast drafts - Abu Dhabi, Ras-al-Khaimah, Dubai, Shargah - which are all on the same model, (3) the Koweit Neutral Zone draft. Of these, the Bahrein draft is the most important from our point of view, in that it seems very desirable to make sure that the terms of the concession would not conflict with'the terms of the Bahrein Petroleum Company^ concession. a copy of the latter concession is attached for reference. i fihnuiH be glad if you would kindly look at the Bahrein draft with this point in view. itu fumtH it- ehoul-a also be glad if you would say whether any points occur to you at first sight in regard to (2) the Trucial 1 common form 1 draft, (3) the Neutral zone draft. The Trucial draft seems to follow, very roughly the same kind of lines as the Qatar Cone ess ion^jand^ the Koweit (proper) Concession, espies of which arc attached, though the arrangement is not the same. In due course “Political Agreements 1 ’ (between H.M.G. and the Company) will have to be drawn up, but this need not be done for the moment.(\M&gt;AAshu/* fas*. ? two- ^ im&gt;ik cmcs, WHITEHALL, ‘ , ICth Marc^ 1936.

Vhole question has now been considered in the light of Company’s letters of 30th January and 6 th February, and follov/ing are provisional conclusions of His Majesty’s Government. 3. Bahrein. Sheikh should be informed that Petroleum Concessions Limited, having asked His Majesty’s Government for permission to approach His Excellency with a view to negotiating for the unallotted area on basis of draft concession submitted, have been informed that His Majesty’s Government have no objection to their doing so. Presumably Holmes will be required to approach Sheikh through Political Agent in the first instance, but having done so might conduct detailed negotiations direct while keeping Political Agent informed of their progress. 4. Muscat * There is no objection to Company approaching the Sultan. 5. Trucial Sheikhdoms. -hen question of options has been disposed of (see my telegram No. 832, dated 7th March) there is no objection to Holmes opening negotiations with Sheikhs whom he would invite to Bahrein for the purpose. He should make his first approach to them through the political Agent, who should be kept in close touch with the progress of the negotiations. The following/following preliminary conclusions have been reached at this stage on questions of (1) Boundaries, (2) Protection. As regards (i), it will be sufficient at this stage to define areas of concessions as those of the respective Sheikhdoms without annexing maps, but eventually it will be desirable to define boundaries so far as possible, and His Majesty’s Government accordingly suggest that Resident should take steps as soon as possible to enquire into boundaries of various Sheikhdoms inter s e and vis-a-vis Muscat. Question of boundary between xlbu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia v/ould depend on course of negotiations with Ibn Saud. as regards (2) His Majesty's Government are inclined to view that so far as possible all resiDonsibility for protection should be placed by the concession agreement on Sheikhs themselves (compare Article 15 of draft concessions and condition (c) attached to approval of the options), but provision could also be made in political agreements and in accompanying exchange of letters between Government and Sheikhs concerned that any movements of Company’s employees entailing special risks (e.g. penetration for more than a certain distance into the hinterland) should be subject to prior written permission of Sheikh who would thusbe responsible for saying where Company could operate and consequently (in the event of any incident occurring) for taking all possible action against the culprits and ikying any compensation which His Majesty’s Government might consider necessary. 6 . x-ls regards Bahrein, Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat, we should emphasise both to Holmes and the rulers concerned in informing them of permission to start negotiations that no concession can be finally concluded without specific further approval of His Majesty’s Government, who would require Company to enter into separate/3. separate political agreement with them. 7. Please see separate telegram regarding Koweit Neutral Zone. 8 . I should he glad of your and Resident’s concurrence or ohservations in above proposals. Draft concessions would he examined here from legal point of view and corresponding political agreements would he drafted. As regards general form of concessions His Majesty's Government are satisfied that it is in accordance with usual procedure of oil companies nowadays to combine exploration and development in one concession agreement.- ■■■■ rS INDEXED FOttE: I 1631 L 'Zg'* fy _ i IGN OFFICE, 6th March, 1936. (E 1063/260/91) IMPORTANT. . 6 '* Dear Walton, You will remember that at the meeting which was held at the India Office on 21st February to consider the question of the proposed activities of Petroleum Concessions Limited in Arabia and the Persian Gulf, it was agreed that, as regards the company’s proposals for applying to the Sheikh of Koweit for a concession, insofar as the Sheikh’s own rights were concerned, over the Koweit neutral zone, it would be best, before going any further, to obtain an egression of Ryan’s views. I am afraid that, owing to heavy pressure of other urgent work, we have been rather longer than we should have been in preparing the necessary draft to Ryan; but we have now done so and I enclose it herein for your consideration. Would you very kindly let me know as soon as you conveniently can whether you concur in its terms?]? 1063/8^0/^1. Sir Ryan, Jedda. va JL u ^ « 1631 iarod 6 1936 J Bir , You will t&lt;ave seen, from the oor -espondenoe printed copies of which were enclosed in my despatch Ko.8l of January l?th, that the Iraq ietroleum 'ompany have formed a new company, to be known as Petroleum Concessions 1 imited, for the purpose of acquiring oil concessions in certain areas in the Persian n T ulf and elsewhere;Majesty's government omoerned ?he majority of them present no serious difficulty; but a someefc-at mo^e complicated situation arises as regards the proposals which the new company contemplate making to the Sheikh of -oweit, for the grant of an oil concession* insofar as the -heikh’s own rights are concerned, over the 'oweit ieutral ao m As you know, the situation as regards the grant of any oil concession in this area has been greatly complicated by the $rart by King Ibn Baud, in respect of his own rights over the aone, of an option to the Standard HI ’jompany of ''alifornia, to acqni re o \ equal terms any concession for which an offer may be made. If then Petroleum Concessions imited acquires, not only a similar option, but an actual concession, from the Bbeikh of Koweit, in respect of hie rights, the effect may well be to perpetuate the present deadlock and to render even more remote the prospects of any agreed concession being granted to a single company by both f \ V,-- \ A ^ rulere/3*5 fal#rs and of any oil in the area baiiig actually exploited. It may be # there fore, that ing Ibn Sand mi^ht resent the action of Hia Majesty’s Government in giving their formal approval to the present proposal of retro! ©urn Conoeeione imited, - i.e. in allowing the Uheikh of Koweit, who ca give no oil concession without their consent, to negotiate with Petroleum aonceoaiona Limited on the basis proposed. 4. On the other hand, were Petroleum Concessions Limited to acquire ti-ie concession, the result might be to prevent a further potentially important area in Arabia from falling under t,he exclusive commercial control of an entirely non-British company. As you know, the Koweit neutral rone falls within the so-called Line agreement* so that the constituent groups of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and there fore of Petroleum Concessions Limited, are preoluded from competing individually for a concession therein. ho other serious British company/ r—ooapany is likely to be able successfully to take up or exploit any concession In thiir^^ea, and the only possibility of securing at least partial British participa tion in such an oil concession therefore seems to lie in the present proposal. ''he grant to Petroleum Concessions imited of a definite concession oyer this areai insofar as his own rights were concerned, by the heikh of roweit might Indeed effectively remove the dang er of the Standard Oil Company of California ever obtaining an exclusive concession for themselves over it, and the .ultimate result might be some compromise between the two com panies, which would bring about the termination of the present deadlock, ensure the effective exploitation of any oil that might be found In the zone, and, at the same time, prevent the area from falling under exclusive American commercial control. 5. everthelens His Majesty 1 s aovernment are reluctant to encourage etroleum con cessions him! .ed to pursue the aatter with /, -k ,t.)

He said that the India Office had explained that it had proven necessary to consult Sir Andrew Ryan and that there might be some further delay. Meanwhile Major Hdaes was anxious to get on with the negotiations. 2. I explained that in this particular case the delay was due to the Foreign Office. The Sheikh of cnA. / Koweit could not grant any xsttefr concession without the approval of Hio Majesty’s Government. If then Petroleum Concessions Limited acquired this particular concession, it would be definitely with our blessing and approval. Meanwhile, King Ibn Baud had already committed himself to the grant of an option, insofar as his own rights were concerned, over the same area, to the Standard Oil Company of Caliiornia. The position was therefore rather a delicate one, and we felt that we ought to be quite sure of our ground before we committed ourselves. 3.

I would suggest that we should now have an informal meeting of representatives of the interested departments (Foreign Office, Petroleum Department, Admiralty, and Air Ministry) to consider the situation. The following appear to be the main points for discussion. 3. Bahrein and Muscat . Can the Company be allowed to authorise Holmes to start negotiations at Bahrein on the basis of the draft concession, and to approach the Sultan of Muscat, where if business resulted the ultimate E.A. Seal, Esq., Admiralty, S. W. 1.negotiations would follow the lines of the Tracial Coast drafts? Such permission would he given on the understanding that there will have to he concurrent Agreements between the Company and His majesty’s Government. 4* Trucial Coast . On the question of procedure in regard to the approval of the options already obtained by the D’Arcy Exploration Company ( alias Anglo-Persian Oil Company) I have consulted Powle. That is a comparatively unimportant matter. The main question is whether we can now allow the Company to authorise Holmes to enter into negotiations with the various Sheikhs (who would visit Bahrein for the purpose) on the basis of the draft Concessions, subject, of course, to the concurrent negotiation of satisfactory agreements between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. It will be noted that the Company, propose to apply for concessions straight away without waiting to do any exploratory work under the existing options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6 th February and explained that their reasons for this are not any desire to rush us, but that their arrangements with Holmes make it desirable to get the whole tiling settled as soon as possible; and apart from this they wish to3. enter e-t once into ifini! n^reeinents ''•'■’ith. one olieiklis (j.ro-*i which of course the latter would benefit financially), 'becans 6 tlie price of 1 ’trie concessioiio ruigiii oe unduly enhanced in tlie event (i rnp rob a d 1 e tnougli they think, it) of oil having actually been found in one or more of the territories concerned 'before the concessions are obtained* 5. VtLth a view to deciding whether permission can be given to corninenceneii-1 of the Trueial Coast, negotiationsj we may have to consider in a preliminary way a.u this stage certain points which will be fully dealt with at greater leisure, in consultation with the interested departments, when we prepare the Government agreements that will have uO accompany the concession agreements, v~£ » ? (l) question of boundaries - on this, as you will.see from my letter of 7th February to Fowle, Skliros is quite ready to be accommodating, (2) the connected question ox protection* As regards the latter point, Article 15 of the draft concessions puts certain responsibility on the Sheikh (which seems right, so far at any rate, as it goes;. 6 . The question of a refinery will of course be dealt with in the Government agreement* 7 . Koweit Neutral Zone . This question presents difficulties. Hitherto we have envisaged no more thanLf 0 5 4* an attempt Toy the Company to obtain an option from the Sheikh# How they want to commit the Sheikh to certain specific terms as the basis of any joint concession which might eventually be granted# Skliros states his position in his letter of February 6th.

Air Mail. 7th February, 1936. cvLx With relerence to my letter of 31st January., P.Z.677/36, and previous correspondence regarding the proposals of petroleum Concessions Limited, 1 enclose copy, letter of 12th December. Copy is also enclosed of a demi-official letter which 1 sent to Skliros on 4th February, and his reply dated 6 th February. 2 . he shall of course be consulting you further, after obtaining the preliminary views of the other Departments of His Majesty’s Government, regarding the various draft concessions enclosed with the letter of 30th January from Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3. The point on v/hich 1 want to consult you at the moment is the procedure in re 0 ard to the approval of the options already obtained by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company from the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. The original Dated 30th J anuary. with six enclosures, of the Company's reply to our ofiicial proposal/ The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.E., BUSHIRE.proposal or Petroleum Concessions Limited in their letter of P4th Occober was that they should take transfer of these options from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and we have signified that we would approve the grant of the options and their transfer on the conditions set out in paragraph 5 of our letter to Petroleum Concessions Limited of 12th December. The + wo Companies now propose a somewhat different procedure - viz., that the options should not be transferred, because for technical reasons (presumably the wording of the option agreements) they are not transferable, and suggest that the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions might be given at the same time as approval of the options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6 th February, and 1 explained to them that it may be some little time before approval can be given to the opening of negotiations for actual concessions on the lines of the draft concessions which they have sent us. In accordance with paragraph 5(d) of our letter of 12th December approval has yet to be given to the commencement of negotiations for actual concessions, and though it is probable that we shall be able to give it, the question has yet to be decided in consultation with/Art) \+&lt;r$ 3. with the other Departments and yourself, and mi^ht talce a little time to consider from the point of view of the possible commitments which would be involved in the eventual grant of concessions. (Two points which might have to be considered are, for example, the southern boundary of the Abu Dhabi concession, and the general principles which we might have to get clear in our own minds in advance in regard to the sort of provisions that should be made for the protection of the concessionaire. I dare say there will be no great difficulty on either point. Sbliros suggested at our talk on 6th February that the southern boundary of the concessions might be kept indeterminate and said that he saw no reason why the Company should not agree that any operations to work a concession would be confined within whatever distance of the coast we pleased. But these points have to be considered.) 1 infoimed Skliros and Lefroy that we would let them have an official reply to the Company’s letter as soon as possible, but that there must be some little delay on account of the necessity of consulting the other authorities concerned. Meanwhile it is probable that Holmes may be able to fill in/4. in time by starting work in regard to the Bahrein concession and perhaps visiting Muscat, though he will not make any start at all until we iniorm Petroleum Concessions Limited that he may do so. 4. Now with relerenoe to the procedure in regard to the existing options. there seem to be two alternatives - ( 1 ) to approve the grant of the options to the Anglo-iranian Oil Company at once, on that Company agreeing to conditions (a), (b) and (d) and the Sheikhs concerned agreeing to condition (c); ( 2 ) to postpone approval of the options (a course to which the Anglo-iranian Oil Company have no objection) until we are in a position to approve the opening of negotiations for actual concessions; then to approach the Sheikhs in regard to condition (c), 'to explain to them the proposal that negotiations should be opened by Petroleum Concessions Limited, and then approve at the same time both the options and the opening of these further negotiations. The second alternative seems to have the merit of making one bite at the cherry with regard to the Sheikhs. It will in any case presumably be necessary for someone to/M-l o. oO explain to the Sheikhs how it comes about that &gt; though it was the Anglo-1ranian Oil Company which obtained the options, it is Petroleum Concessions Limited which is negotiating ior concessions. It will, of course, primarily 'be ior the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company representatives in the Gulf to do this, and we understand that they will be instructed to introduce Holmes and give the necessary (explanation, but it will perhaps also be desirable that you, when the.time comes, should inform the Sheikhs that His Majesty’s Government approve the opening of negotiations under the options by Petroleum Concessions Limited through Holmes, and that it will be understood that any concession concluded can only be granted subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. As, therefore, it will probably be desirable to approach the Sheikhs at the time when Holmes opens his negotiations, you may think it the simplest and least troublesome course to postpone till then the approach to them, in regard to the approval of the options and condition (c). Could you kindly let us know by telegraph which course you think preferable from your point of view?Lf~l | 5 . 5. Vie are assuring, in view of your telegram of 4tn December, 110.99 5, that you have no objection to the v emplovraent of Holime 3 sls the individual to oe entrusted oy the Company with the, negotiations. 6 . Since this was written, Lefroy telephones that his Company are advised by Elkington that they should explain to the Sheikhs forthwith the present position in regard to the options and the proposal which is being made to His Majesty’s Government that their affiliated company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., should negotiate concessions. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company aru instructing Elkington to act accordingly, subject to your prior approval of the messages to be sent to the Sheikhs. I do not think that this development greatly affects the choice between the two alternatives suggested above in regard to our own procedure, since when the proposal that P.C.L. should open negotiations for concessions has been approved by His Majesty’s Government, it will still no doubt be necessary or desirable that you should inform the Sheikhs that this is the ca.se.

WALTON.P.Z. 946/19Z6. &gt;• 4 iv U- 1 Petroleum Concerjaions Limited, City-Gate House, PinsLury Square, London, E*G.2* 6 th February, 1936, Lear Mr. Walton, In reply to your letter of the 4th instant, I send herewith four more seta of the draft Concessions. 2. I have discussed with Mr. Lefroy the formal \ transfer of the frucial Coast options, but although the two companies concerned are in entire agreement over P.C.L. negotiating and obtaining the Concessions in its own name, I gather rhat technically the options themselves are not transferable; Mr. Lefroy has offered to, clear up this matter with you. 5. The operation of oara.5(c) of your letter of the 12th December will not arise for some time; the D’Arcy will not be sending out anyone, and P.C.L. does not propose to launch an exploratory party of two or three geologists until October next. Mr. Holmes has already left, but he does not propose to wander along the frucial Coast; his proposal was to take up residence in Bahrein, where the Company willbe in funds at the Eastern Bank, and with the approval of the Political Resident to request the Rulers of the Trucial Coast to call one at a time, discuss terms, sign, and take away their bags of Rupees. 4. It will be necessary, of course, for the D’Arcy to notify each Ruler that Mr. Holmes is negotiating with its full approval on behalf of P.C.L., and I hope that you can instruct the Political Resident to confirm to e son j- &lt; 415 ) w-ii Sclc.i.

It ’.vould be most unfortunate IP the Rulers, havinn pranced these options to the D 1 Arcy, should maintain 'chat Concessions can be- .^ranted only to the D'Arcy, and not to P.C.L.; as you are aware the I)'Arcy ic unable to hold these Concessions* i apree that the Kov/eit Heutral lone presents a distinct problem; recoanisinp that it is impossible uO negotiate sim.nltane 0 usiy ./ith the Sheilch and with -tvinp Aoaul Aziz, I endeavoured to lay down in the draft the terms which would be binding on the Sheikh; similar terms would then be oi'iered to Kin^ Abdul Aziz. If they do nou reaen his minimum, the terms must either be increased until he is satisfied - in which case the Sheikh would receive corresponding benefit - or the idea 01 obtaining a comprehensive concession over the heutral lone would have to be dropped* In the latter alternative P.C.L* must pay to the Sheikh the whole of the option money that it will have eonerected to pay during the five-year option period; it can then either retire from the scene, or it can elect to way the increased yearly payments that will become applicable after the initial live-year option period, and persevere with King Abdul Aziz. I have accepted it as an essential preliminary to a successful negotiation of this Concession, having regard to the oil rights being under co-interested ownership, to bind one of the parties to certain definite terms, otherwise a negotiator appealing- in uurn uO L/he Sheikh and then to King Abdul Aziz would be consigned from pillar to post. I am aware that King Abdul Aziz has bespoken his share of the oil rights in the Neutral lone to the Standard Oil Company of California; he is reported to have hedgedA)J) Lj-tlf inclj J .0 .,.'alt on K aq_., C .£ .., M. India Office, it e hall, 1 . 1 . 1 . 3. to the extent that he may be unable to ensure that the Standard of California ohall have a 50y interest in any Company that drains that Concession. i.lr. Holmes is my authority for saying that Kine, Abdul Aziz and the Sheikh have exchanged viev/s, and that a merger of Standard of California and Iraq, Petroleum Co. (or P.C.L., in the proportions of 10/60 shareholding, v/ould be acceptable to the king, and to the Sheikh. Such a proposition P.C.L. will not entertain, and it prefers to make an entirely unencumbered bid; seeing that the Sheikh is as yet unattached over the Neutral done, it seems to me that, in the first instance, the obvious thing for P.C.L. is to enter into some arrangement with him. Phis, of course, may result in a stale mate, whereby f.G.L. acquires the -Sheikh’s rights, the while Standard of California holds the King’s. fhat, I think, is the most likely situation to arise; it would not be entirely unacceptable to P.C.L., as although involving gratuitous payments to the Lheikh it would at least give us time to persuade King Abdul Asia. But if such a situation is entirely unacceptable to His majesty's Government, I am open to discuss, at any time convenient to you some other line of approach to the Neutral zone problem. I should explain that the seeming anxiety of f.C.L. to get quickly on the scene is prompted by rumours of Standard oa California activities in that direction, ana although that may not result in the grant of concessions to them, any delay in direct approach by P.C.L. can only make the path of P.C.L. more difficult.

Application may oe made to the Sheikh of Koweit for an option over his part-interest in the zone, on the understanding that, if it should later 'become possible for the Company to seek a concession from him and King Abdul Aziz jointly, the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government would he sought before the Company entered into negotiations with those rulers, and that any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such conditions, embodied in an agreement with His Majesty’s Government (which might be of a special character, in view of the peculiar juridical position of the zone), as were considered necessary to safeguard British political interests. 5 . Sheikhdoms of the Crucial Coast, The Anglo-I ram an Oil Company are being informed that His Majesty s Government approve the options already granted to them by the Sheikhs of Has al Khaimah, Sharjah and Dcbai on the following conditions, and on the same conditions there is no objection to the transfer of those options, ana of any others that may be obtained on the Trucial Coast and approved by His Xajesty’s Government to your Company:- (a') that any geologist or employee who visits any of the Trucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationality. If, however, your Company should make the application of which the possibility is foreseen in the penultimate paragraph of your letter for special permission for I.ir. N.E. Baker, an American citizen, to visit areas on the Trucial Coast, the question of making an exception in ills particular case would be considered in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Cb)/(Td) that any exploring or surveying party in their travels would he definitely guided hy the views of the Resident as to where they should go; (c) that the Sheikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing (as to which he would he approached hy the British political aithorities) that he would he responsible for the safety of the exploring or surveying party; (d) that if it is desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Sheikh concerned for a concession, the prior approval of His Majesty f s Government to the opening of negotiations would he sought and in the event of its being given, the v -conditions to he attached to any concession obtained, in order to safeguard Government interests, would he considered and the approval of any actual concession would he subject to acceptance hy the Company of these conditions. 6 . The conditions to he embodied in any agreements relative to conces..ions would he considered in consultation vrith your Company when the time came, and might vary somewhat according to the locality in which the concession was sought. I am to add that as you are aware, the erection of a refinery or refineries in territory under British influence in the Persian Gulf is one of the prime desiderata of His Majesty’s Government. 7* It is noted that your Company will keep the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf informed of any negotiations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit the Sultan of Muscat or other rulers.

Skliros, / / Managing Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company, regarding / a proposed procedure for acquiring options, and subsequently possible concessions, for oil in certain areas in the Persian Gulf. Certain points in this letter were more fully explained at an interview which I had with Mr. Skliros and Mr. Lefroy of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company on 23rd October. 2. The reason for forming a company - Petroleum Concessions, Limited - separate from the Iraq Petroleum Company is, I understood,merely that the latter company has an Iraqi Government director, and it is not considered necessary or desirable that\he should participate in undertakings solely concerned tyith the acquisition of concessions in countries outside Iraq. 3/ G.W.Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.lAs regards the Koweit neutral zoney Petroleum 2 Concessions 5 Limited are aware of the position of deadlock resulting' from Ibn Baud’s commitment to the Standard Oil of California 9 but they think that by the offer of an arrangement to facilitate the marketing of the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s production they may obtain the necessary leverage to induce the California Company to reLinquish their stranglehold on Ibn Saud’s part-interest in the Koweit neutral zone, 4. tyith reference to the unallotted area of Bahrein, Mr. Lefroy did. not think that this would be of value to might be worth while d-o obtain an option with a view to its examination. So far as 1 know, v/e have not entered into commitments with anyone regarding this area, so that it is presumably open to any company which desires to do so \ &gt; to apply to the Sheikh for a concesi &gt; course, to His Majesty's Government’s approx anyone, but Mr. Skliros was inclined to think that it On the Trucial Coast the j Company (or the D’Arcy Exploration Company) have., as you know, already obtained two-year options, subject to His/Lf 3\ ^35 - 3 - His Majesty's Government's approval^ at Has al Khaimah 31 y ) and Sharjah. Mr. Lefroy See papers enclosed with India Oi'fice n, printed letters P.Z.5980o dated 2nd \ stated that they have September 1935 9 and P.Z.7001 9 dated 3rd \ October 1935, respectively. ) just obtained a similar option at Debai. U’hey are also in the field for options at Abu Dhabi, Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain. The Anglo- Iranian Oil Company ^ould go forward with their pending negotiations ? but any concessions for v/hich they have V acquired or may acquire options on the Trucial Coast v/ould be negotiated and taken by Petroleum Concessions, Limited. 6 . The reference to the Pirate Coast is a geographical misunderstanding. Petroleum Concessions, Limited, might interest itself in the possibilities of Muscat, where we have not committed ourselves to anyone and the field is consequently open. 7 . I stated that certain preliminary conditions to the approval of options on the Trued.al Coast (which had been discussed with Fowle during' his\deputation) would be \ required by His Majesty's Government, .viz.: Vis-a-vis the C ompa ny i- (a) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the Trucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationalitys (b)/■+J3 (43^) _ 4 - (b) that the exploring party in their travels would beNdefinitely guided by the views of the Resident a^\to where they should go. Vi s~ a-vis t he ' v ^he i kh; - (c) that the Sheikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing that he would be responsible for th\ safety of the exploring or surveying: party. I added that another condition to the approval of an option would be that further approval by His iviajesty's Government would be necessary before negotiations for an \ actual concession were entered intp with the Sheikh concerned. 8 . The question of our future policy on the Trucial Ccast 9 which was discussed by the MiddiDe East Committee on 24th September 9 has 9 of course 9 a certain, relevance to the question whether in this backward and uncivilised area the acquisition of oil concessions by any compariV? of whatever nationality ? ought to be encouraged or permitted. The result of the meeting- in regard to general policy was somewhat inconclusive 9 but there is 9 I think 9 nothing in the conclusions 9 such as they were 9 to suggest that we ought/- 5 - ought to ai.’rive at a definite decision to sterilise the trend of the discussion was rather in the opposite direction^ and Fowle\himself 9 though he is averse from any new pronouncement of general policy 9 has always taken the view that in regard to oil we can hardly impose an absolute though specially careful conditions to safeguard the interests of His Majesty’s Government and limit our commitments would be necessary. In any case 9 by stipulating that the actual commencement of negotiations for a concession, apart from the conditions on which it should be granted, will be subject to His Majesty’s Government’s approval, we shall, so far as is now practicable, ensure that each case is kept open for decision by His Majesty’s Government, when the time comes, in the light of considerations of general policy and of the degree of commitment which the grant of any concession would involve. that the national complexion of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, is identical with that of the Iraq Petroleum Company. It was explained to me that Petroleum Concessions, Limited, would probably beget separate companies to exploit Trucial Indeed, the veto on concessions which the Sheikhs may wish to grant, Cn the question of nationality, it will be seen the/the several areas in which they might be successful in obtaining concessions 9 but that such are the national jealousies on the part of the non-British elements in the Iraq Petroleum Company that there is no chance of such companies being formed on a basis of a larger proportion of British ownership than that in the Iraq Petroleum Company itself. As, however, the areas mentioned (apart, possibly, from the Koweit neutral zone) are within the Red Line Agreement, it seems necessary to be content with the Iraq Petroleum Company's proportion of British shareholding, since no British company outside tne Iraq Petroleum Company has shown a serious interest in these areas. Holmes has indeed been angling during the last few months for the interest of an all-British group (which however, had no experience of oil concessions), but I have now heard from him that his negotiations ha.ve definitely broken down. 10. If the Foreign Office and the other Departments concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf agree, we would propose to inform Petroleum Concessions, Limited, as follows;- (a) On the Trucial r subject to the conditions stated above, His Majesty's Government approve the options already/already granted by the Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah, Sharjah and Debai, and any options that may be granted by other Sheikhs. If it is desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Sheikh concerned for a concession 9 the prior approval of His Majesty's Government will be required before such negotiations are opened. In the event of such approval to the commencement of negotiations being given, the conditions to safeguard Government interests which would have to be attached to any concession obtained would be considered and would have to be accepted by the Company before an actual concession was approved. (b) In Bahrein and Muscat there is no objection to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, applying to the rulers concerned, on the understanding that any ..concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests. (c) As regards the Koweit neutral zone, application may be made to the Sheikh of Kov/eit for an option for his part-interest in the zone, on the understanding that, if it should later become possible for the Company to seek a concession from him and Ibn Saud jointly, the prior approval of His Majesty's Government would have to be sought before the/443 ') - 8 - the Company entered into negotiations with those rulers, and any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such conditions (which might be of a special character, in view of the peculiar juridical position of the zone) as were considered necessary to safeguard British political interests. 11 0 it will be observed that the Company propose to employ Holmefe, for the negotiations of actual concessions. Mr. Skliros explained that this proposal was made f aute _de m ieux . It is ofkcourse primarily the business of the Company whom they empfoy and, subject to Fowle’s views, we do not think that wegneed make any objection. 12 . If Petroleum Concessions Limited should make the application, of which the possibility is foreseen in the penultimate paragraph cf Mr. sfcliros's letter, for special permission for Mr. Baker to visit .areas on the Trucial Coast, we could consider in consultation with Fowle the question of making’ an exception in thd^ particular case from the general rule suggested in paragraph 7 (a) above. 13. I am sending a similar letter to Starling and Seal, and a letter, of which a copy is enclosed, to Air Vice- Marshal Courtney. We should be grateful if you could let us have//* P.Z.7763/35 Pi^'ROLEUu CONCESSIONS LIMITED, CITY-GATE HOUSE, FINSBURY SQUARE, LONDON, E.C.2 24th October 1935. a-3 y &lt;449 The Under Secretary of State, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l Sir, 1 have the honour to refer to ray conversation yesterday with Mr. J.C.Walton, at which I indicated that, subject to the a. proval of His Majesty's Government, my Company, Pecroleum Concessions Limited, proposes to seek for oil concessions in the territory known as the Neutral Zone, the unallotted part of Bahrein Island, the Trucial Coast, and possibly along the Pirate Coast to Muscat. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. was registered as a private British Company on the 14th instantj the whole of its shares will be held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the Board will be of similar composition, excepting the appointment of an Iraqi Government Director. The concession recently obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited from the Ruler of Qatar will, at an appropriate time, be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Limited, together with the Agreements relative thereto concluded with His Majesty's Government; the provisions of these Agreements are generally acceptable to Petroleum Concessions Limited in their application to oil concessions obtained over the above named territories wherein my Company recognises, and will respect, the existence of a spe cial/special sphere of influence of His Majesty's Government. There will also be transferred to Pecroleum Concessions Ltd. options for oil concessions recently obtained by the Anglo-lranian Oil Company Ltd. from the Eulers of Ras-el-IOiaimah, Sharjah, Dubai and any other options obtained by that Company on our behalf in the Trucial Coast. The negotiations for the actual concessions will be undertaken by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and in that connection it is proposed to employ Major Frank Holmes, who is acquainted with Persian Gulf matters and who, to the best of my belief, can be entrusted to conduct such negotiations with proper observance of the customs of those countries. The terms to be offered will be based on the terms of the Qatar concession with suitable adjustment of the cash payments in relation to the respective approximate areas of the concessions; the actual boundaries will be defined at a later stage as and when they are demarcated. The wishes of His Majesty's Government in regard to the employment of British subjects in these areas will be observed, but I foresee possibly applying for special permission for the Company's Chief Geologist, Mr.H.S.Baker, an American citizen, to visit these areas to compile a report on their oil potentialities. The Company will comply with any instructions issued by the Resident or his representatives in regard to the movements, and for the protection of Geological reconnaissance parties. A I shall be glad to hear whether these jjroposals are agreeable to His Majesty's Government and whether I may have permission to proceed on the above lines with the co-operation/. \ 1 ■ co-oporation of the Resident in the Persian GuI-l, v/ho will be kept informed of the negotiations. 1 have, etc., PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED.

The Shaikh of Kuwait [Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ] exercised joint control over the Neutral Zone with the King of Saudi Arabia [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd], generally referred to in the papers as Ibn Saud, and neither ruler could grant a concession without the co-operation of the other. The Sheikh of Kuwait could not grant a concession without the approval of the British Government.The papers include: draft concession for the Neutral Zone prepared by Petroleum Concessions Limited (folios 419-433); India Office correspondence, memoranda, and minutes of meetings with oil company representatives; correspondence concerning the negotiations from the Foreign Office, the British Legation, Jedda, the Political Agent, Kuwait, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Petroleum Department (later the Ministry of Fuel and Power); Ibn Saud's decision, as far as his own rights in the area were concerned, to grant an option to the Standard Oil Company of California (later the Arabian American Oil Company), (the rights were secured by agreement in 1939); the question of whether the Kuwait Neutral Zone was within the 'Red Line Agreement' of 1928 (e.g. folio 357); correspondence from Petroleum Concessions Limited; the Company's decision to pursue an option rather than a concession (folio 348); draft option agreement (folios 332-335); the role in the negotiations of Major Frank Holmes (including correspondence from Holmes); the Shaikh of Kuwait's view that the whole of the Neutral Zone should really belong to Kuwait (e.g. folio 320); minutes of meetings at the Foreign Office with representatives of the Company, and the Company's financial offer to Ibn Saud (folios 253-269); and the agreement between the Arabian American Oil Company and the Eastern Gulf Oil Company to compete with PCL for the Shaikh of Kuwait's rights in the Neutral Zone, 1943-44.The file also contains one apparently misfiled letter dated 31 January 1947 (folio 4).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait-Saudi Neutral Zone</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
