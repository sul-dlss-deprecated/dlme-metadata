As well as correspondence, the file contains a number of detailed accounts of these events that were written by the British Agent in Jeddah, Reader William Bullard.The majority of the correspondence in the file is between British officials, but the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence from Ibn Sa'ud and officials of the Government of Hejaz. These letters are translated into English and the file does not contain copies of the Arabic originals.The file contains English translations of two proclamations that were delivered by Ibn Sa'ud in October and November 1924 (folios 189-190 and 236).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Agent and Consul General, Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Hejaz Ḥusayn bin 'Alī al-Hāshimī</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kingdom of Hejaz</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003bf#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003bf#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003bf#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
