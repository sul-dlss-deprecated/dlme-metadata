Do cord 3ht:9 1- Foreign Office, March 31, 1914, I EA\ E already spoken to you about the difficulties which are raised by the additional article, proposed in the draft enclosed in Prince Lichnowsky’s letter ol the 1st February: I am anxious to avoid a formal official corre spondence, as I think we may be able to reach agreement more speedily without it, but at the same time, as the subject is so complicated, I think it u ill be convenient to you to have a written statement from me. . .^° 1 r of reference, I enclose a copy of the additional article in its original form. In om view, the basis of the whole Treaty is that we undertake not to oppose your going as far as Basra, and you agree not to go beyond Basra. Our undertaking is given in clause (a) of article I; whereas in clause (a) of article III it is agreed that no railway shall be built “from Basra to the lersian Gulf” unless and until there is complete agreement between the Ottoman, British, and German Governments. There has been a difference of 'opinion between our two Governments as to one point arising from the last-mentioned clause : we are willing to agree that if the line is ever built there shall be no discrimination in 'rates,'but you wished us to go further (which, for political reasons, we were not willing t&gt; &gt; do) and agree that there shall be two German directors on the board. ^ In \iew of the terms of article III clause (a) (which confers on either Government the power of vetoing the line altogether), the settlement of this &lt; 1 iffeience did not appear to be of immediate importance. l\ow, however, you have proposed an additional article which, if adopted as it stands, would bind the British Government, owing to circumstances wholly beyond their control, to agiee to a line being built from Basra to some point nearer, and possibly on, the Persian Gulf, and, if the line were built, to agree that there should be German participation in the capital and German representation on the ooard. (/&lt;pfeel confident lie would'accept it; in any case I am certain that he would ne.t go beyond it: “ Should the port of Basra, owing to some unforeseen physical cause, he rendered inaccessible to ocean-going vessels, or should serious and insuperable obstacles arise to the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab up to the said port, His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they would, in accordance with article 10 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of , take steps to promote the construction of a line from Basra to some point nearer the sea, affording free and easy access to such vessels, provided that in the Company controlling the line, British participation in the capital, and British directors on the board, clearly and permanently predominate. “ In such a contingency, adequate arrangements would be made to ensure to the Bagdad Hallway Company traffic facilities, and to obviate any sort of discrimination in the transport of passengers or goods'''; and His Britannic Majesty’s Government would not oppose German capital participating in the line, and its representation on the board thereof. The proportion of German directors would not exceed the proportion of the British directors specified in article I, clause (b), of the present Convention. r If an article is really desired, I sincerely hope that you will at least recommend this wording to your Government. If they and His Majesty’s Government were to agree to it, and if the few remaining points already discussed are settled, I cannot see why the whole Treaty should not fee initialled by us ad referendum very shortly. It would be a great advantage if this could 1 be done.Enclosure 1. Additional Article. Should the Shatt-el-Arab, after a reasonable tim6, not have been brought into a satisfactory state of conservancy assuring sea-going vessels of free and easy access to the port of Basra, or should this state of conservancy not be maintained, His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will agree to the construction of a branch from Basra (Zobeir) to the next point allowing a free and easy access to sea-going vessels. In this case His Britannic Majesty’s Government will not oppose German capital participating in this branch line and its being represented on the board of this line under exactly the same conditions and in the same proportion as British capital shall be represented on the board of the Bagdad Railway. Enclosure 2. Article 2. Clause (a). The Bagdad Railway Company having concluded with the Imperial Ottoman Government an arrangement on the following basis, the Imperial German Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare, so far as concerns themselves, that they adhere to the said arrangement, and will use their best endeavours to secure its due execution :— (i.) The terminus of the Bagdad Railway Company’s line shall be at Basra, and the Bagdad Railway Company has renounced all claims to construct a branch line from Basra (Zobeir) to the Persian Gulf, referred to in article 1 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, and to build a port or railway terminus on the Persian Gidf, under article 23 of the said Bagdad Railway Convention. Enclosure 3. Article 3. Clause (a). The Imperial German Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment declare that they will in no case support the construction of a branch from Basra (Zobeir), or from any point of the main line of the Bagdad Railway, to the Persian Gulf unless and until there is complete agreement on the subject between the Imperial Ottoman Government, His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and the Imperial German Government.

(Translation.) Your Excellency, German Embassy, London, March 23, 1914. UNDER instructions from my Government I have the honour to transmit to your Excellency herewith a strictly confidential memorandum setting forth the views of the Imperial Government in regard to the construction of a railway to Mendeli. I have, &amp;c. LICHNOWSKY. Enclosure in No. 1. (Translation.) Memorandum. (Strictly Confidential.) THE Imperial Government have serious hesitation regarding the extension to Mendeli of the proposed feeder-railway to the Tigris. If, however, after the completion of the Bagdad Bailway from Khanikin to Basra , the British Government should express to the Imperial Government a wish to extend to Mendeli a railway from Kut-el-Amara to Bedrai, the Imperial Government would, in order to comply with the wishes of the British Government, refrain from opposing such an undertaking by British interests either on the ground of this line being longer than 100 kilom. or on the ground that Mendeli lies within the 60-kilom. protective zone of the Bagdad- Khanikin line. It would, how r ever, in any case be necessary to obtain the consent of the Imperial Government for any prolongation of the railway past Mendeli. The assent of the Imperial Government to the construction of the railway to Mendeli could be given in a note from the Imperial Embassy ; this note must, however, in all circumstances remain secret, and should not be published without the consent of the Imperial Government.

I am to enquire the views of the Board of Trade respecting the proposed change in the clause regarding British directors on the board of the Bagdad Railway, and, if possible, Sir E. Grey would be glad to have a reply this week so that the matter may be further discussed with Herr Bergmann before his departure. With regard to article 6, clause h, of the draft convention (which as you are aware the German Government have now conditionally agreed to), the following modification has been proposed to Herr von Kiihlmann for submission to his Government:— “ The expert referee shall, unless it be otherwise agreed to by the parties concerned, proceed to Basra for the purposes of his enquiry. He shall publish his report within four months after having received all the necessary materials from all the parties, including both commissioners (instead of ‘ both sides ’), or within four months of his arrival at Basra.” I am to add that this modification has been proposed with a view to ensuring that the British Commissioner shall be effectively heard by the expert referee. I am, &amp;c EYRE A. CROWE.2 v » Enclosure in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. I HAD a meeting with Herr von Kuehlmann and Herr Bergmann to-day. I communicated to them copies of the agreement, initialled by the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company and Signor Nogara, for their confidential information. I also communicated to them a draft of the agreement which it is suggested should be signed by them (i.e. the Bagdad Railway) on the one hand and Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch on the other. They said they would consider it, and they anticipated no difficulty as it was merely an amplification of what had already been initialled ad referendum. I then raised the question of British directors on the Bagdad Railway. I said that in the German draft of November 3, 1913, article 1, the following clause was suggested :— “ The Imperial German Government declare that they will use their best endeavours to secure that two British directors, agreeable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government, shall be admitted as representatives of a group of British shareholders to the Board of the Bagdad Railway Company.” In our counter-draft of December 15 the words underlined had been omitted, and in the last German counter-draft (that of January 1914) the words “ agreeable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government ” had been omitted. The German representatives explained that they did not like retaining the words “ agreeable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government” if it were not stipulated that they should be “ repre sentatives of a group of British shareholders ” as it looked as if His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment had two watch dogs. I explained our difficulties, and I suggested that, inasmuch as the two British directors would have to have a qualifying holding they would themselves be shareholders, and therefore, speaking tenta tively, I did not see why we should not accept the German counter - draft of November 3 (quoted above) provided the three words “a3 group of” were deleted. They said they would recommend this to Berlin by telegraph. I said my proposal was non-committal, pending refer ence to the Board of Trade and Sir E. Grey’s decision. They said the Deutsche Bank group which controls the Bagdad Railway would give an undertaking to the German Government, who in turn would give an undertaking to His Britannic Majesty’s Government, that the said group would always vote in favour of two directors agreeable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government. They said that they assumed that His Britannic Majesty’s Government would not oppose the investment of British capital in the railway, and I reminded them that we had expressly under taken not to oppose it in article 1. They said they would like to get some capital in London, and I indicated the distinction betw r een directors and groups, pointing out that the latter need not necessarily be entrusted with the presentation of directors. This point is being referred to Berlin, but it is desirable that we should have an early expression of the views of the Board of Trade. They then said that they would like the words printed in italics added to article 3 of the annexed tentative draft. I consider that they should be added. A. P. March 18, 1914.

For the purposes of this article, the western terminus of the Bagdad Railway shall be held to be at Konia and the eastern terminus at Basra.

There shall be a protective zone extending for 60 kilom. on either side of the Bagdad Rail way, and any line passing within the said zone shall be held to be in direct competition, pro vided that in the region between Museyib and Kurna the protective zone shall be bounded on the east by a line drawn midway between the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, from the latitude of Museyib to Kurna 3. Local lines serving as feeders for the river navigation and not exceeding 100 kilom. in length shall, provided they do not pass within the protective zone, not be held to be in direct competition. 4.

The German Government, though with great hesitation, were prepared to meet His Majesty’s Government with regard to a line from Mendali via Bedrai and Jes'san to Kut-el-Amara on the Tigris, subject to three conditions:— 1. The assurance which would be given to His Majesty’s Government in a note must not be divulged without the prior assent of the German Government. 2. The line must not be built before railway communication was established between Khanikin and Basra via Bagdad. This would probably not be very long as the Bagdad Company was entitled to guarantees. 3. The line must not be continued beyond Mendali without an agreement with the German Government. I think these conditions are reasonable, and 3 especially so, as we only ask for the line as a feeder for the river navigation. Herr von Kuhlmann had received no instruc tions from his Government about Beyshehir, the other subject dealt with in Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 79 of: March 21st to Berlin : but Herr Berg- mann had received a very peremptory telegram from his Bank saying that the Bagdad Railway could not agree to the meeting point of theii system and the Smyrna-Aidin Railway being at the town of Beyshehir, but Herr Bergmann would do his best to get it fixed half way up the Lake. I thereupon read to them Sir L. Grey s telegram to Sir E. Goschen, and we agreed to postpone discussion. A. P. March 23, 1914. &gt; I *2 \;s BMAR1SU- Annex. Sir Edward Grey to Sir E. Goschen. (No. 79.) (Telegraphic.) R. Eoreign Office, March 21, 1914, / 30 p.m. ( DISCUSSIONS have been taking place with German representatives regarding railway interests in Asiatic Turkey, and memoranda and maps go to your Excellency by post to-night. I regret to say that two serious hitches have arisen. The Germans have pressed me to give an undertaking that no railways shall be built which are in direct competition with the Bagdad Railway at any point between Konia and Basra. I have with considerable hesitation expressed my readiness to accept a formula which rules out any lines within (‘&gt;0 kilom. of either side of the line and any line nortli of certain limits if it establishes direct railway communication between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, while remaining lines, except short ones serving as feeders for the river navigation, are, failing agreement, to be classed as competing or non-competing in accordance with the award of an arbiter. This concession on my part wall meet with formidable criticism here when the agreement is published, and it goes much further than anything I had previously contemplated. Asa counter-concession, which it must be admitted is out of all proportion to that we have expressed readiness to make, I have asked—■ (a.) That a line from Mendali to Kut-el-Amara on the Tigris should be included in the short feeders for the river navigation ; and (b.) That Lake Beyshehir should be regarded as within the area to be served by the Smyrna-Aidin Railway. As regards (a), our argument is that when the Bagdad Railway from Bagdad to Basra is completed, a great part of the through traffic will be diverted from the river to the railway, and it is therefore vital that the river service, in which the Germans will be shareholders, should be fed by local lines and traffic. Mendali will probably be just inside the 60-kilom. zone measured from the Khanikin branch, and the line we propose would pass via Bedrai and Jessan, which would make it rather longer than 100 kilom. As regards (b), please refer to arguments in memorandum printed in “ Turkey” series under date of 21st February, and to memorandum which goes to you by post to-day. The Smyrna-Aidin Company claim that the junction, or point of meeting, of extensions from their system and the Bagdad system should be Lake Seidisheir ; the Bagdad Railway representatives claim that it should be at the north end of Lake Beyshehir, a solution which would be disastrous to the Smyrna-Aidin Company. As a compromise 1 can induce the company to agree to make the meeting-point at the town of Beyshehir, which serves as a market for the whole district. A our Excellency should represent to the German Government the difficulties of the situation and the very considerable concessions which we have shown ourselves ready to make, the enormous area to which our concessions to Germany relate, and the great importance I attach to these two small points being conceded. Though 1 am very desirous that the negotiations should be speedily concluded, I cannot give w r ay on either of these points without taking back the concessions we have made in favour of the interests of Germany. The Smyrna-Aidin Railway is the oldest and only remaining British railway in Asia Minor and is entitled to special support from His Majesty’s Government; and I have only been able to agree to the proposed settlement regarding railways in Mesopotamia on the understanding that British rights in the river navigation should be consolidated and put upon a permanent footing, a consummation wffiich is impossible if local traffic such as would be brought by a line from Mendali is to be ruled out. As Mendali is nearly 00 kilom. from the proposed alignment of the Bagdad Railway no serious competition can be feared. Ihroughout the discussions the German negotiators have laid stress on the necessity of our making concessions on the ground that German public opinion must be considered. In return I must ask that British public opinion be taken into account. I shall have to defend our concessions before Parliament, and I must be in a position to show that important British interests have not been sacrificed. I shall be glad to receive a telegraphic reply from your Excellency if possible by Tuesday afternoon.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] TURKEY. CONEIUENTIYL.

Memorandum showing the Reasons why the Company desires Permission to navigate Lakes higher dir and Beyshehir and to construct a Line of Railway connecting the Lakes.—(Communicated to L)r. Riese, Herr Bergmann (of the Deutsche Lank) y and Herr von Kuhlmann on February 21, 1914.) EXTENSIVE and proverbially fertile plains lie to the east of Lake Egberdir and Lake Beyshehir—in which are situated the towns of Yalovatch and Karagatch—which are entirely cut off from the Anatolian Railway by mountains over 4,000 feet high and over 3,000 feet above the level of the plains, but which can easily and piontab y be developed by the Smyrna-Aidin Company if its application is granted or a concession to construct a line of railway connecting the two lakes and to navigate th .0 Icikos. • The road over the mountain from Yalovatch to Akshehir on the Anatolian Rai way is always very difficult, and is dangerous in winter. On an average the road is impassable for one month in every year. . p ,1 o Am’ The distance from Yalovatch to Smyrna (the terminus of the Smyrna-Aidm Railway) is 328 miles, of which 18 miles is easy road to Lake Egherdir, 17 ™' les 18 water across the lake to the town of Egherdir, and the balance, 293 miles, is the Smyrna ^ThedTstence from Yalovatch to Haidar Pasha (the terminus of the Anatolian Railway) is 398 miles, of which 20 miles is very difficult road over the mountains to Akshehir, and the rest the Anatolian Railway. . . r +1 o wacIp™ Haidar Pasha is 170 miles further from the principal ports of the weste Mediterranean than Smyrna. T i The distance by the Smyrna-Aidm Railway from Lake Beyshehn to Smyrn 368 miles, of which approximately 40 miles is road. , tt • v ;a The distance by the Anatolian Railway trom Lake Beyshehir to Haidar Pasha Konia is 5S6 miles, of which 65 miles is road over very hilly country. It is believed that the existing traffic over the mountains to Akshehir does bring more than 3,0001 or 4,0001 revenue per annum to the Anatohan Railway Owing to the nature of the roads, road transport is very costly, while na 'g at y' “ the lakes, especially when the two lakes are joined by the proposed new ™ give a hiohlv effective and cheap service for the plains round the lakes to bmy . In suite of existing conditions the lakes are now largely navigated but only miserablekaft are availfble, and there is no accommodation for loading, unloading, or 'il’Slfi i. ,«««, only t. bronght «. Egho* by w.J, .b. gno.th of traffic is greatly stunted and the development of the country is retarded. It if contended by the Smyrna-Aidin Company that 18 a la S er better market for the products of the country round the lakes in question t Constantinople^ ^ it is contended by the Anatolian Company ^ the water-shed is south and east, the country along the shores La k e Beysh 1^ belongs properly to the Anatolian Railway, and that owing to the country by the German irrigation works the increased traffic should be earned entirely by the Anatolian Railway. The company’s answers to these contentions are . 1 That owing to the distance from Konia and the nature of the country the district round Lak! Beyshehir cannot be developed by ^XTsT”^ wards and that the natural outlet for the products of the country westw . [2034 x—1]2. If a line is drawn half-way between Egherdir—the present terminus of the Smyrna—Aidin Railway—and Konia, which is the nearest point on the Anatolian Railway with which railway communication with Lake Reyshehir could be established, it is found that the whole district round the shores of Lake Beyshehir lies to the west or Smyrna-Aidin Company’s side of such line, so that this lake is properly included in . the Smyrna—Aidin Company’s sphere, but even so, the company asks for no monopoly of the traffic. 3. It is admitted that Lake Beyshehir drains southwards into Lake Seidishehir, which is 22 miles from Lake Beyshehir, and thence through the narrow and extremely difficult gorge of the Tcharshambe Sou into the plains of Kouia, but the Smyrna—Aidin Company cannot admit that, on this ground alone, they are for ever precluded from developing the country. The Smyrna-Aidin Company is prepared to admit the fairness of the contention that at any rate the greater part of the traffic created by the proposed irrigation works should be carried by the persons responsible for the works, but as far as the Smyrna-Aidin Company are aware the nearest irrigation works contemplated are near Lake Seidishehir, or 22 miles to the south of the south end of Lake Beyshehir, 50 miles from the termination of the Smyrna—Aidin Company’s proposed Beyshehir extension, and quite outside the district now proposed to be developed by the Smyrna—Aidin Company. It is believed also that the works contemplated are not of large dimensions. The Smyrna-Aidin Company cannot admit that because at some future date, if engineering difficulties can be overcome, the irrigation works may possibly be extended northwards, the Beyshehir district is for that reason to be deprived of railway facilities for an indefinite period. 4. Nearly the whole of the land proposed to be irrigated by the Anatolian Company is situated in the plain south-east of Konia, and it will take many years and a largely increased population to develop it in its entirety. This plain, through which the Anatolian main line runs, is capable of absorbing the whole of the water available for irrigation in Lakes Beyshehir and Seidishehir. 5. Camels and other means of transport are not to be found in sufficient quantity to carry produce to the railways. This is a continually-increasing difficulty, and the railways must, in their own interests and those of the population, be extended to the centres of production.Iii any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. f ~7 “) / and address— j ^ The Under-Secretary |of State, Foreign Office, London. ! j 1/ The Under-Secretary oj State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Undersecretary of State for and, by direction oj the Secretary \ of State, transmits herewith cop*A^&gt; of the under-mentioned paper.

I explained our difficulties, and I suggested that, inasmuch as the two British directors would have to have a qualifying holding they would themselves be shareholders, and therefore, speaking tenta tively, I did not see why we should not accept the German counter - draft of November 3 (quoted above) provided the three words “a [335—3]I '. 2 group of” were deleted. They said they would recommend this to Berlin by telegraph. I said my proposal was non-committal, pending refei ence to the Board of Trade and Sir E. Grey’s decision. They said the Deutsche Bank group which controls the Bagdad Railway would give an undertaking to the German Government, who in turn would give an undertaking to His Britannic Majesty’s Government, that the said group would always vote in favour of two directors agreeable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government. They said that they assumed that His Britannic Majesty’s Government would not oppose the investment of British capital in the railway, and I reminded them that we had expressly under taken not to oppose it in article 1. They said they would like to get some capital in London, and 1 indicated the distinction between directors and groups, pointing out that the latter need not necessarily be entrusted with the presentation of directors. This point is being referred to Berlin, but it is desirable that we should have an early expression of the views of the Board of Trade. They then said that they would like the words printed in italics added to article 3 of the annexed tentative draft. I consider that they should be added. A. P. March 18, 1914.3 ' \ Annex. 1 i A * Tentative Draft of March 17, 1914. Article 3 (e). His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment declare that they will in no case themselves establish, or support any claim by any persons or corporations whatsoever to establish, in Ottoman territory, railway undertakings either in direct competition with the Bagdad Railway Company’s lines, or in contradiction with that company’s existing rights, unless and until there is complete agreement on the subject between the Imperial German Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Government. For the purposes of this article, the western terminus of the Bagdad Railway shall be held to be at Konia and the eastern terminus at Basra. In regard to article 3, clause (c), of the Anglo- German Convention of , it is agreed as follows :— 1. No lines in that part of Asiatic Turkey which, west of the 36th meridian of east longi tude, lies south of the 34th degree of latitude or in that part which, east of the said meridian, lies south of the 31st degree of latitude, shall be held to be in direct competition ; but any line north of these limits shall be held to be in direct com petition if it establishes direct railway com munication between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. 2.

Ivkrch 14th, 1914. toy dear Paricer:- I send you here a slightly amended tentative draft based on our conversation of yesterday. I pro pose to leave out if possible special mention of the toendali line, not that I want to kill your pet child but accurate measurements on the large scale map show that a 100 kilometre line would be sufficient to con nect Mendali and A&amp;izie, which is quite as good as Kut-el-Amara as a terminus. I have considerable doubts if oil would ever pay the building of even a narrow gauge railway, a pipe line is always so much cheaper to build and to work that if oil is found in considerable quantities near Mendali the chances for the building of a pipe line seem much greater than those for building a railway. 7 can be left out as it only repeats a principle embodied in Article 8 of the Conven tion, but if you attach great importance to it it may stay. Au revoir on Monday, Yours very sincerely, (Signed) Kiihlmann*It, is agrued as follows:- 1. No linos in that, part of Asiatic Turkey which, west of the 36th meridian of east longitude, lies south of the 34th degree of latitude and that part which, east of the said meridian, lies south of the 31st degree of latitude, shall be held to be in direct competition. 2. Local lines in Turkish territory serving as feeders for the river navigation and not exceeding 100 kilometres in length shall not be held to be in direct competition. 3. There shall be a protective zone extending for 60 kilometres on either side of the Bagdad Railway. In the region between Bagdad and Kurna the protective zone shall be bounded on the east by a line drawn midway between the Rivers Tigris ana Euphrates, from the 44th meridian of east longitude to Kurna. 4.

Alas, I am In trepidation regarding the en- closed so far as its chances of success here go; hut I fear your tentative modifications will diminish those chances. 2. I deprecate any specific mention here of Turkish territory. The article of the Convention is confined to such territory, and I think it is a mis take to introduce the words you suggest in section 2 of the present draft. We have always made it clear that we reserve a free hand in Persia, and it is essential that article 3 of the Convention should he expressly confined to Ottoman territory as otherwise you might rule out the Mohammerah Khorremmahad project, for which we hold a concession* 5* Kut-el~,Amara is a larger and more con venient place than Azizie for a terminus* Also it is not certain that Mendali is outside the 60 kilometre zone of the Sadijeh-Khanikin line* I prefer thereforeto retain our article 5* I do not only count on oil for traffic, but on the produce of Mendali, Bedrai, and Jesean* Recollect that you will he shareholders in the river navigation company] 7* ihe retention of this article is most import ant.

Note communicated to German Ambassador, March 3, 1914. HIS Majesty’s Government have had under further consideration the draft of article 3 (c) of the proposed Anglo-German Convention regarding the Bagdad Railway and cognate matters, in which, in distinction to the limitation proposed by them, the words “ east of Aleppo ” have again been inserted by the German Government. His Majesty’s Government are, in deference to the views of the German Government, and in their desire to reach an early settlement, prepared to modify the article so that it may be worded as follows :— “Article 3 (c). His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will in no case themselves establish, or support any claim by any persons or corporations whatsoever to establish, in Ottoman territory railway undertakings either in direct competition with the Bagdad Railway Company’s lines, or in contradiction with that company’s existing rights, unless and until there is complete agreement on the subject between the Imperial German Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Government,” provided that the stipulations proposed in the annexed draft are added. In view of this concession, which in effect protects the whole Bagdad Railway from direct competition, His Majesty’s Government earnestly trust that the German Government will use their powerful influence with the German railway interests concerned, in order that the German opposition to the very moderate requests of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company in regard to the navigation of Lake Beyshehir may be withdrawn. The point, as has already been explained informally to Herr von Kuhlmann, is one to which His Majesty’s Government attach great importance. Foreign Office, March 3, 1914.

Our counter proposal is substantially identical with the British proposal of February of this year. On legal grounds the Imperial Government consider it undesirable that a wording- should be chosen which covers the case of all nations interested in the shipping of the Shatt-el-Arab. Such arrangements would be contrary to the principles which have hitherto been strictly adhered to by the Imperial Government.

Cox and with representatives of the Foreign office and the Board of Trade. The part of the Convention which has most interest for this Office is that dealing with the conditions of German acceptance of the Anglo-Turkish Shat-el- Arab Convention signed in July last*. (Arts. 6 and 7) . The Germans^ it will be seergdrop their roposal for an interna tional 'Comite de Surveillance' to super vise the proceedings of the Riverain Commission; but they do not accept Art.6(AJ of the British Counter-draft of 15th Dec.commercial interosto* In its place^they propose an arrange ment (p. 4 of their Note) by which their Consul at Basra, in case of any difference o* opinion with the Commission, will invoke the aid of the C-erman Embassy at Constantinople, which, failing an agreement by ordinary diplomatic neans, will arrange with the Porte to refer the question to arbitration. But the Arbitration Court, instead of including representatives of the ’five Powers most interested by reason of the magnitude of their shipping in the Shatt-el-Arab! as proposed in *i.e.Turkey, Persia. w Great Britain, our Draft, will consist of 1 German, 1 Turk, and Germany and Russia.. a third person to be agreed on by the 2 parties. There seem* to be insuperable o' jections to the German proposal as its stands, which would eliminate Great Britain altogether from the arbitration proceedings, and would go far to place the Riverain Commission at the mercy of the German Consul at Basra. The Foreign Office are understood to be in favour of pressing the Germans to a.ccept our Article 6 (b) , which was itself of the nature of a compromise and may be regarded as the utmost limit of concession to German demands. But in one respect the German formula is preferable to our own*, in that it restricts the scope of the arbitration to the particular question at issue, whereas under the British draft the arbitration Court is empowered to pronounce upon the general question 'whether there is good ground for thinking that the 'Commission, if maintained, will not be able to provide for ' the reasonable requirements of the commerce of the river .' In other words, it is competent to the arbitrators to recommend the abolition or reconstitution of the Commission, a foriMINUTE. and we are pledged to do our best to see that their recommendations are carried out. Perhaps a compromise might be found in a clause based as far as possible on the G-erman formula,^providing for a more satisfactory court of arbitration. This point will be discussed further with the Foreign Office. Article 7 . Some clause of this kind appears to be inevitable. But the article as it stands is open to two objections:- (1) the phrase M the next point allowing, &amp;c M needs elucidation. It is essential that if ever an extension beyond Basra is built, it should terminate at some point where we can exercise effective control; and (2) it ought to he made clear in the Convention that the Basra-Gulf section will be a predominantly British enterprise. This is nowhere stated, though it may perhaps be held to he implied, in the text as it stands at present. It is suggested that the last two lines of the 1st paragraph of Article 7 might be amended as follows:- “to a point giving free access, &amp;c. “provided that the point is selected in accord- “ance with the wishes of His Majesty’s Government, “and that British interests and capital shall have “a predominant share in any Company that may he 'formed for the construction and exploitation of 'the branch.'

[4601] No. 1. Prince Lichnowsky to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 2.) (Translation.) Your Excellency, ^ German Embassy, February 1, 1914. UNDER instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit to your Excellency herewith a statement containing the counter-proposals of the Imperial Government in regard to the draft agreement respecting the Bagdad Railway, enclosed in the confidential memorandum of the loth December, 1913. I have, &amp;c. LICHNOWSKY. i Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum communicated by Prince Lichnowsky. THE Imperial Government have, with the greatest care, studied the British counter-draft for an Anglo-German Convention of the 15th December, 1913, and the confidential memorandum of the same date. Prince Lichnowsky now has the honour to communicate a further draft designed to meet as far as possible the views put forward in the British memorandum of the 15th December. It must be emphatically stated that the proposals made on the 7th May, 1913, have always been considered by the Imperial Government as tentative and non committal. Their aim was to establish, as far as possible with such intricate questions covering a wide field and deeply affecting important interests, a basis for discussion. It is inevitable that in such a discussion as the different questions are explained in fuller detail some modifications have to take place, and it must be pointed out that if the draft as it now stands gives to Germany some advantages not mentioned in the draft of the 7th May, 1913, it contains, on the other hand, important German concessions not stipulated in this draft, as, for instance, the very important article 3, clause (b), or the participation with 40 per cent, of British capital in the construction and management of the port of Bagdad. It is not proposed to deal here with the points raised in this connection in the memorandum (article 2, clause (c); article 4, clauses (b) and (c), and article 5, clause (6), as they have to be examined in detail later on), but it can be stated that none of these points if agreed to by His Majesty’s Government would in any appreciable or essential way interfere with the objects which His Majesty’s Government was aiming at. The two points put forward in the memorandum a,s being the most important desiderata of His Majesty’s Government have from the beginning of the negotiations been in principle accepted by the Imperial Government. It is open to considerable doubt if a speedy solution of the questions still under discussion would be advanced by examining in a sort of historical retrospect at length every concession made by both sides in the course of the negotiations and by covering a good deal of ground where agreement has already been practically obtained; the Imperial Government therefore, while entirely reserving their attitude towards the arguments adduced in the British memorandum, prefer to confine their remarks to the details of the convention actually still under discussion. The Imperial Government hope that His Majesty’s Government will examine the proposals of the counter-draft here included in a spirit of fairness and conciliation, so that a speedy and satisfactory solution of all outstanding points may be attained. Prince Lichnowsky will now proceed to discuss seriatim the points raised by the British counter-draft of the 15th December, 1913. Article 1. Article 1 remains materially as proposed in the British counter-draft. The Imperial Government agree to furnish His Majesty’s Government with authentic [2034 5—1] B —2 copies of all agreements between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company, and it is also agreed that it should be expressly stated in the explanatory note that the freedom of action of the Biitish Government with regard to future variations of the concession is not impaired by this wording^ This is accepted on the distinct understanding that the British Government shall act in exactly the same wa^ about all agreements concerning river navigation in Mesopotamia and the River Conservancy Commission. The inclusion is accepted in the explanatory note of the words “ under the express condition that no prejudice of an economical or financial nature is caused to Great Britain in pursuance of this clause.” The German Government agree that the obligations of Great Britain under this clause should be defined in the same document. There has been no intention on the side of the Bagdad Railway interests to earmark any part of the Turkish customs increase to 15 per cent, for this undertaking, they think therefore sufficient if the explanatory note stated that Great Britain would be bound by this clause not to oppose an allocation of existing Turkish revenues sufficient for the construction of the Bagdad Railway system. We would prefer to leave out clause (b) of article 1, as the line from Bagdad to Basra is part of the Bagdad Railway system. If this is done, “ or management ” would have to be inserted in article I, clause (a). As in article 2, clause (a) 1, Basra is expressly mentioned as the terminus of the line. This stems a further reason for leaving out clause (b) article 1. Clause (c). The modus 'procedendi for the admission of English members to the Conseil d’Administration of the Bagdad Railway has been explained in Prince Lichnowsky’s note of the 16th July, 1913. These proposals having been accepted there seems to be agreement about this point. If the British Government insists on leaving out “ as representatives of a group of British shareholders,” this would be agreed to provided that “ agreeable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government ” shall equally be left out of the convention. Both clauses could be inserted in the explanatory note. Both give details about the way to elect two British members which are entirely covered by the exchange of notes proposed by Prince Lichnowsky. It must be clearly understood that the two British members cannot enjoy any privileged position, but shall be in a position of absolute equality with all other members of the Conseil d’Administration. Should the British Government propose to drop clause (c) altogether and arrange for the election of the two British members by exchange of notes there would be no objection. It seems desirable to say “ members ” instead of “ directors,” and instead of the “ Board of the Bagdad Railway Company,” “Conseil d’Administration ” of this company, as those are expressions used in the original documents. Without knowing exactly the arguments of the legal advisers of His Majesty’s Government concerning certain remarks made by Herr von Gwinner in June 1913 it would not be possible to discuss them, but probably no useful purpose would be served by such discussion. The Deutsche Bank does not agree with the views put forward on p. 5 of the British memorandum concerning the participation of British capital in the Bagdad Railway, but this question being highly technical might better be left to a special discussion between the Deutsche Bank representatives and British interests. The Deutsche Bank considers that their offer will put the British shareholders in a more favourable position than those shareholders who have been in the undertaking from the beginning. The intention of the Deutsche Bank is to offer part of the shares belonging now to the Ottoman Bank under exactly the same conditions under which these shares shall be sold by the Ottoman Bank to the German group. Article 2. Clause (a) 1.—It is proposed to strike out “or in any other way derived, 5 ' as the convention to be concluded between the Turkish Government and the Bagdad Railway only mentions article 23 of the Bagdad Railway Concession. There seems to be no necessity to retain those words, as there exists absolutely no agreement between Turkey and the Bagdad Railway from which such a right could be derived.,. The Imperial Government cannot accept the statement that the stipulatioiRjn clause (c), concerning German representatives on the board of the Zobeir Gulf section, are misleading and inequitable, the same reasons which have prompted His Majesty’s Government to ask for two members on the Conseil d’Administration of the Bagdad Railway, viz., to provide against any possible discrimination on that system, has led to demand a German representative on the board of the Zobeir line to safeguard the important rights conceded in article 2, clause (a) III. They nevertheless agree to leave out the second part of clause (c), beginning with “ in this event ” to “ Bagdad Railway,’’ provided that this is not taken to prejudice in any way the position the Imperial— - - 3 Oorernment might take up should the line from Zobeir to the Gulf ever be undertaken, and provided a complete agreement is reached in all other outstanding points of the present convention. IV. As British interests now demand a 40 per cent, participation both at Basra ^ .and Bagdad it is proposed to have only one Company for both harbours. The text is modified accordingly. The Imperial Government agree to section 4 of IV, but do not see their way to accept section 5, for which there seems to be no necessity as being entirely covered by section 4. Clauses (b) and (c) are accepted in principle, but we propose to say at the beginning of clause (6), “The Imperial Government declare that they will not oppose,” to make it exactly similar to article 4, clause (b). Instead of “Directorate” it is proposed to say “ Conseil d’Administration,” to bring it in accordance with the wording of the agreements with Turkey we would like to see the words “ if any ” maintained for the reasons given before. Clause (d) is agreed to. Article 3. Clauses (a) and (6) are accepted, but it is suggested that at the end of article 3 the Imperial Ottoman Government, being the Sovereign of the country, shall be named first of the three Governments. In article 3, clause (c), it is proposed to strike out the words “ in the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad.” It seems an essential condition of an agreement like the one which is under discussion that one party should not interfere with acquired rights and important interests of the other. A limitation to the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad might be interpreted as if the Bagdad Bailway interests agreed in all other provinces to the construction of railway lines either in direct competition with the company’s lines or in contradiction with that company’s rights. The Imperial Government would like to have fuller information about plans to build at some distant date a line from the Mediterranean to Lower Mesopotamia as mentioned on page 7 of the British Memorandum. Article 4. Clause (a) is agreed, provided that the Imperial Government are furnished with authentic copies of all agreements between the British Government and the Ottoman Government, and provided there is no occasion for objection in the final texts of these agreements. The questions raised by the concession of the 12th December for the navigation on the Mesopotamian rivers are still under examination, and are better reserved for future discussion. Clause (b) is agreed with slight verbal alterations. We propose to insert “ i.e., 20 percent, of the whole share capital,” to make it quite clear that this shall be a permanent proportion, and, further, they would prefer, instead of “ by one director,” “ their rateable participation in the board,” to make it clear that if any change in the ■number of directors occurred the German shares should always be assured of a proportional representation on the board. If His Majesty’s Government should insist that no alteration takes place in clause (b), article 2, it is proposed to say in article 3, clause (h), t ' His Majesty’s Governmeut and Imperial Government agree that they will use their best endeavours to secure, &amp;c.” The same, if stress should be laid on retaining in article 1, clause (c), the words u agreeable to His Majesty’s Government,” it would be claimed that the words “ agreeable to the Imperial Government ” should be interpolated in this article -after the word “director.” Clause (c) is agreed to, except the time limit for the conveyance of the building material on the rivers till the completion of the line to Basra. The Bagdad Railway interests are quite willing to come to a friendly agreement with the Ottoman Company for River Navigation to have all the material transported by them after cancelling their existing agreements with Messrs. Lynch, but they do not see their way to give up, vis-d-vis of Turkey, their right secured on the original concession of transporting their own materials should the Ottoman Company for River Navigation fail to conclude a satisfactory arrangement for transports or fail to carry out this contract in a satisfactory way. As a slight verbal alteration, we propose to say, instead of “ through British or Ottoman agency,” “ by the Ottoman Company for River Navigation.” Article 5. Clause (a) is accepted. Clause (b) cannot be accepted definitely, but it is hoped that a discussion between the concessionnaires of the River Navigation Company and the Bagdad Railway interests might lead to an agreement acceptable to both parties. 5 a. The Imperial Government consider the retention of article 5 A in the conventionas absolutely vital. In the first tentative sketch of an agreement of the 7th May, 1913 y . it was very strongly pointed out that an assurance practically analogous to the article 5 as we proposed should be given, not only by the Ottoman Government., but also by His Majesty’s Government. The whole agreement is based on the assumption that the access to the terminus of the railway in Basra shall always be open for sea-going vessels, ^ and this undertaking forms, in the opinion of the Imperial Government, a vital part of the whole convention. Both by the wording of the introduction which we propose, and by introducing “ so far as possible,” we believe to have removed any objection which His Majesty’s Government might have against the article 5a. The same general assurance about the levying of dues in the same article seems desirable, and corresponds with the last sentence in article 4 of the protocol of the 7th May, 1913. Article 6. In this article we propose to insert after “ assured ” “ on terms of absolute equality,” and later on, after “ international commerce will,” “ so long as the convention is not materially altered.” It is proposed to finish this article with “uphold the convention.” The following details, which, in the opinion of the legal advisers of the Imperial Government, are entirely covered by this undertaking, would, in the form now proposed, raise numerous legal difficulties and occasion protracted discussion. The recommendations to be made to the Riverain Commission of the 9th September shall be embodied in the explanatory note, and serve for the definition of the duties of the Riverain Commission. Section II is agreed to. Section III can, if our proposals for article 5a are accepted, be left out. Clause (b) requires in the opinion of the Imperial Government complete recasting. The Imperial Government propose to conclude with the Imperial Ottoman Government an arrangement on the following lines :— The German consul at Basra shall have the right to correspond with the Riverain Commission on matters within the competence of the Commission. Should the Commission fail to meet the reasonable requirements of the commerce of the river and refuse to remove the causes of complaint the question would be transmitted to Constantinople to be dealt with through diplomatic channels. Failing an agreement between the Ottoman Government and the German Embassy either party shall have the right to ask for arbitration. Each party shall appoint one arbiter and they shall agree about a third. It is proposed that in the present convention the British Government should take note of this agreement between Germany and Turkey and undertake to uphold it. If this was agreed upon, the whole article 6 (6) might be left out. Article 7. Having agreed to the insertion of “ as far as possible ” in article 5 A the Imperial Government feel that they must have some undertaking for the impro table but possible case that Basra would cease to be accessible for sea-going vessels and theieby become totally unfit to be the terminus of a great railway system. With such a change in geographical conditions all the assumptions on which this piesent^ convention is based would have disappeared and the necessity would arise to provide the Bagdad Railway system with a new terminus easily accessible for sea-going vessels. An examination of the_ main bases of this convention will make it cleai that the Imperial Government must insist on some clause giving them a guarantee against the teiminus ol the Bagdad Railway system becoming through change in geogiap»hical conditions an isolated inland town cut oil from communication with the sea. I oi the same reasons which have led the British Government to ask for two members on the Couseil d’Administration of the Bagdad Railway, i.e., to have a guarantee for tiie fulfilment oi the stipulations about through-traffic and prevention of discrimination, the Imperial Government think it fair that Germany should have in this connecting railway, m case the necessity of building it ever arose, a share in the capi at anc ^ directorate similar to that held by England in the Bagdad Railway Article 8 agreed to.5 Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Deutsch-englisches Abkommen. Deutscher Gegenentwurf vom Januar 1914. Article 1. Clause (a). Recognising the general importance of the completion of the Bag dad Railway for international commerce. His Britannic Majesty’s Government undertake not to take or encourage any measures likely to impede the construction or management by the Bagdad Railway Company of the Bagdad Railway system or to prevent the participation of capital in this undertaking. Clause (6). The Imperial German Government declare that they will use their best endeavours to secure that two British members shall be admitted to the Conseil d’Administration of the Bagdad Railway Company. Article 2. Clause (a). The Bagdad Railway Com pany having concluded with the Imperial Ottoman Government an arrangement on the following basis, the Imperial German Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare, so far as concerns themselves, that they adhere to the said arrangement, and will use their best endeavours to secure its due execution :— (i.) The terminus of the Bagdad Railway Company’s line shall be at Basra, and the Bagdad Railway Company has renounced all claims to construct a branch line from Basra (Zobeir) to the Persian Gulf, referred to in article 1 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, and to build a port or railway terminus on the Persian Gulf, under article 23 of the said Bagdad Railway Convention. (ii.) No discrimination, direct or in direct, shall be permitted on the Bagdad Railway Company’s system, either as regards facilities or rates of charge for the [2034 6—1] C6 conveyance of like articles between the same points on account of the ownership, origin, or destination of goods presented for transport, or in any other manner whatever. (iii.) In the event of the constructio/? of the said branch line from Basra (Zobeir) to the Persian Gulf being undertaken, adequate arrangements shall be made to secure facilities for through traffic from and to the Bagdad Bailway Company’s system, and there shall be complete pro tection against discrimination, direct or indirect. (iv.) The construction and exploitation of the proposed ports of Basra and Bagdad, authorised by article 23 of the Bagdad Bailway Convention of the 6th March, 1903, shall be carried out by a separate Ottoman company. No duties or charges of whatever nature or under whatever denomination shall be levied by the port company on any vessels or goods which shall not equally, under the same conditions, be imposed in like cases on all vessels or goods, whatever be the nationality of the vessels or their owners, or the ownership or country of origin or destination of the goods, and whatever be the places from which the vessels or goods arrive or to which they depart. In all that relates to the stationing, loading, and unloading of vessels in the ports, no privileges or facilities shall be granted to any vessel or vessels which shall not equally and under like conditions be granted to all other vessels. The Imperial Ottoman Government re serves to itself the right to confer upon the Commission, which it proposes to entrust with the improvement and main tenance of the navigability of the Shatt-el- Arab, its rights of control over the port of Basra. Clause (b). The Imperial German Go vernment declare that they will not oppose the acquisition by British interests of 40 per cent, of the share-capital of the separate Ottoman company for the con struction and exploitation of the ports of Basra and Bagdad, mentioned in sub clause (iv) above, and their rateable repre sentation on the Conseil d’Administration of the port company, and in the contracts, if any, for construction and maintenance. Clause (c). In all that relates to the dues and charges of whatever nature to be levied., and to the facilities to be accorded, in the ports of Basra and Bagdad, goods arriving or to be forwarded by water shall receive identic treatment to those arriving or to be forwarded by rail.Article 3. Clause (a). The Imperial German Go vernment and His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will in no case support the construction of a branch from Basra (Zobeir), or from any point of the main line of the Bagdad Hallway, to the Persian Gulf unless and until there is complete agreement on the subject between the Imperial Ottoman Government, His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and the Imperial German Government. Clause (b). The Imperial German Government declare that they will in no case themselves establish, or support any claim by any persons or corporations what soever to establish, a port or railway terminus on the Persian Gulf unless and until there is complete agreement on the subject between His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Government. Clause (c). His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will in no case themselves establish, or support any claim by any persons or corporations what soever to establish, in Ottoman territory east of Aleppo, railway undertakings either in direct competition with the Bagdad Railway Company’s lines, or in contradic tion with that company’s existing rights,, unless and until there is complete agree ment on the subject between the Imperial German Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Government. Article 4. Clause (a). The Imperial German Government, having cognisance of the declaration signed on the 29th July, 1913, on behalf of the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment, concerning navigation on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, declare that they will not oppose the execution, nor support any action directed against the execution, of such declaration, so long as the naviga tion on the said rivers is maintained in substantial accordance with the provisions thereof. Clause (6). His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will not oppose the acquisition by the Bagdad Rail way interests of 40 per cent, of the share capital to be allotted to Turkish interests at the first allotment (i.e., ^0 per cent, of the whole share-capital) and the right in respect thereof to subscribe for a rateable proportion of further issues of capital of the Ottoman Company for river naviga tion, and their rateable participation in the board of the aforesaid company out of the [2034 6—1] &amp;8 iJ Kl share of the directorate allotted to Turkish interests. Clause (c.)—(i.) It is, nevertheless, under stood that nothing in this article shall be held to affect the rights conceded by article 9 of the Bagdad Bail way Conven tion of the 5th March, 1903, except in so far that His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment and the Imperial German Government hereby agree and declare, so far as con cerns themselves, that they adhere to, and will use their best endeavours to secure the due execution of the following pro vision of the arrangement referred to in article 2 of the present convention :— The Bagdad Bailway Company’s rights under article 9 of the aforesaid Convention of the 5th March, 1903, shall cease on the completion of the construction of the Bagdad Bailway to Basra. (ii.) It is further agreed that if an arrangement to the satisfaction of the parties concerned can he made for the con veyance by river of the aforesaid materials through the Ottoman Company for river navigation, His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Government will use their best endeavours to secure the conclusion of such an arrangement. Article 5. Clause {a). The concessionnaire, nomi nated in pursuance of article 3 of the aforesaid declaration of the 29th July, 1913, having concluded with the Imperial Ottoman Government an arrangement on the following basis, His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Government declare, so far as concerns themselves, that they adhere to the said arrangement and will use their best endeavours to secure its due execution :— No discrimination shall be permitted by the Ottoman Company for river naviga tion, either as regards facilities on rates of charge for the conveyance of like articles between the same points on account of the ownership, origin, or destination of goods presented for transport, or in any other manner whatsoever. The Company shall grant no through bills of lading, rebates, or other privileges of any description in respect of goods carried by any ship between any place served by the Company’s vessels and any place oversea, unless the same privileges are accorded in respect of similar goods carried under the Same con ditions and in the same direction between the same places by all ships regularly trading between those places, irrespective of nationality.9 Clause (b). Die Kaiserliche Regierung 1 behalt sich ihre Stellungnahme zur Fassung des englischen Entwurfes vor. Article 5 a. His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Government will join in using their good offices with the Imperial Ottoman Government to secure that the Shatt-el-Arab shall _so far as possible be brought into and permanently kept in a satisfactory state of conservancy in order that sea-going vessels may always be assured of free and easy access to the port of Basra, and to secure, further, that the navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab shall permanently be kept open for sea-going vessels, and be carried on on terms of absolute equality for the vessels of all nations, without regard either to the nationality of the vessels or to their cargoes. Dues shall be imposed, not for the mere fact of navigation, but only for repaying sums actually spent on improvements in the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab and harbour facilities. They shall in no case exceed 1 fr. per registered ton (the dues to cover the coming in and going out of the same vessel); any dues shall be levied on a basis of absolute equality without regard to the nationality of sea-going vessels or their cargoes. 1 Article 6. (a.) The Imperial German Government having taken note of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of , under which the free navigation of the Shatt-el- Arab is assured on terms of absolute equality to the shipping of all nations and a commission is established for the execu tion of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of its channel and for its maintenance and for other like purposes set out therein, and being of opinion that the provisions of the Convention are con ducive to the best interests of international commerce, will, so long as the Convention is not materially altered and so long as the duties imposed upon the Commission by the said Convention are satisfactorily carried out, uphold the Convention. L The Imperial German Government take note in this connection of the declaration, signed on the and attached to the said Convention, to the effect that articles 7 and 8 of the. above Convention do not affect the rights enjoyed in the Ottoman Empire by the nationals of the Treaty Powers.10 (b.) Die Kaiserliche E-egierung behalfc sich ihre Stellungnahme zu dieser Klausel vor. Article 7. Should the Shatt-el-Arab, after a reasonable time, not have been brought into a satisfactory state of conservancy assuring sea-going vessels of free and easy access to the port of Basra, or should this state of conservancy not be maintained, His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will agree to the con struction of a branch from Basra (Zobeir) to the next point allowing a free and easy access to sea-going vessels. In this case His Britannic Majesty’s Government will not oppose German capital participating in this branch line and its being represented on the board of this line under exactly the same conditions and in the same proportion as British capital shall be represented on the board of the Bagdad Bailway. r sjof State. r Article 8. Any difference of opinion arising out of this declaration shall be submitted to arbitration. If the two Governments fail to agree about a special Court or arbiter, the case shall be submitted to the Hague ■* Tribunal.t % [Tills is the Property of Eis Britaimic Majesty’s Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

CONFIDENTIAL. [50643] Copy to !ndiaj 19 PEC 1913 * aL&gt;v:_u . 19 DEC 1913 [1963 p-lj [December 15.] — Section 1. No. 1. Memorandum communicated to German Charge d’Affaires. HIS Majesty’s Government have very carefully considered the counter-draft, communicated by the German Charge d’Affaires on the 4th November, of the proposed Anglo-German Convention re specting the Bagdad Railway and allied questions, and his note of the 3rd November commenting upon this document. Sir E. Grey now has the honour to transmit a further draft, which is somewhat amended both, in form and in substance. The changes of form are primarily due to exigencies of procedure, and are designed to meet the fact that certain stipulations must neces sarily, in the first instance, be agreed upon between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Rail way Company or the proposed River Navigation Company, as the case may be. The changes of substance are largely attri butable to the desire of His Majesty’s Govern ment to recall the German Government as nearly as possible to the original proposals which they put forward, as a basis of negotiation, on the 7th May, 1913, and from which each successive counter-draft seems to have constituted a further departure. So wide indeed has been the de parture that even such important conditions as those contained in section 2 (b) and the first and third sentences of section 3 of the memorandum of that date,—which went far to constitute the credit side of the transaction from the British standpoint,—have now, by the wording of the German counter-draft of the 3rd November, 1913 (article 2, clause (c), last paragraph, article 4, clauses (b) and (c), and article 5, clause (b )), been substantially whittled away. His Majesty’s Government recognise that the proposals made on the 7th May, 1913, were to some extent tentative and non-committal, and they have accordingly not been unwilling, as the German Government are aware, to concede certain important points in the course of negotiation in the interests of a general settle- B2 ment; but they are persuaded that they cannot go further in this direction without so ■tveakening the conditions secured in British interests as to expose the whole Convention to unanswerable criticism and therefore to insuperable objection. This will be the more apparent when attention is drawn to the follow ing considerations, a course which His Majesty’s Government adopt in no controversial spirit. The principal desiderata of His Majesty’s Government have from the first been, and, as indicated in the present British counter-draft, still are, confined to two points :— (a.) That there should be no change detrimental to British interests in what His Majesty’s Govern ment regard as the political status quo at the head of the Persian Gulf. . (b.) That there should be no sort of discrimi nation against British trade on the Bagdad Railway. These points are largely covered by section 2 of the memorandum of the 7th May, 1913, and by the proposal, confidentially explained to Herr von Kuhlmann on the same date, for the institution of a Riverain Commission on the Shatt-el-Arab. “ On the other hand, the desiderata of the German Government, as conceded in the present counter-draft, are relatively not incon siderable :— (a.) His Majesty’s Government agree to an increase in the Turkish customs duties, an in- Qrease which must be borne largely by British trade, seeing that such trade represents some 30 per cent, of the total foreign imports into Turkey ; this increase is virtually a sine qua non to the successful completion of the Bagdad Railway. (6.) His Majesty’s Government undertake not to oppose the construction and management of the proposed railway right down to Basra, the only natural commercial terminus of such a line, by the Bagdad Railway Company. They thereby abandon all claim to British control in the Bagdad-Basra section: it will be recollected that the satisfaction of this claim was at one time a principal condition of British assent to the customs increase. (e.) His Majesty’s Government agree that, in the important provinces of Bagdad and Mosul.3 I |r f where British trade has long been predominant, they will support no railway undertakings either in direct competition with the Bagdad Railway Company’s lines or with that Company’s existing rights. {d.) His Majesty’s Government agree not to oppose the acquisition by German interests of 40 per cent, of the share capital allotted to Turkey in the proposed Ottoman River Naviga tion Company. (e.) His Majesty’s Government acquiesce in certain facilities being granted to the Bagdad Railway Company on the River Tigris at Bagdad. While His Majesty’s Government have no desire to exaggerate the disparity between these respective desiderata, they are confident that the German Government will appreciate their atti tude in regarding the proposals put forward in the revised counter-draft now enclosed as representing the utmost limit of concession to which they can properly agree. Sir E. Grey will now proceed to deal seriatim with the points raised by Herr von K/iihlmann in his covering note of the 3rd November, and to refer when necessary to the corresponding clauses of the counter-draft. His Majesty’s Government are in principle opposed to explanatory notes, holding that a con vention itself should be so clear and precise as to require no explanation; nevertheless, they recognise that, in the present instance, many points of detail are involved and that their inclusion in the text of the convention might prove somewhat cumbrous and inconvenient, and they are accordingly prepared to defer to the wish of the German Government, on the distinct understanding that the explanatory note is ratified and published at the same time as the convention. His Majesty’s Government agree to the adoption ; of the words “system” and “undertaking” as proposed in article 1, clause (u), provided they are first furnished with authentic copies of all agreements between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company, and provided they find no occasion for objection in the final text of the supplementary agreements now under discussion at Berlin, as it is clearly essential that they should know precisely what they are asked to1 4 agree to; provided also that it is expressly agreed in the explanatory note that their freedom of action with regard to future variations of the- concession is not impaired by this wording. His Majesty’s Government would also agree to* the inclusion in the explanatory note of the words “ under the express condition that no pre x judice of an economic or financial nature is caused to Great Britain in pursuance of this clause.” They consider further that the obligations of Great Britain under this clause should be defined in the same document. In the view of His- Majesty’s Government, Great Britain would be- bound, after the signature of this convention and the conclusion of all pending negotiations with Turkey, not to oppose the increase of the Turkish customs duties up to 15 per cent, ad valorem, and not to oppose the allocation of a portion of this increase or of existing Turkish revenues for the purposes specified in article 35 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of March 1903 r such an obligation would not, however, commit His Majesty’s Government in advance to support, the allocation of any particular revenues, but merely that of adequate revenues, to such purposes. His Majesty’s Government prefer the words “ declare that they will not oppose ” to those- suggested in article 1, clause (b), of the German counter-draft ; this undertaking corresponds^ moreover, to that which the German Government assume in article 4, clause (a). The addition suggested by the German Govern ment of the words “ as representatives of a group of British shareholders” in article R clause (c), does not commend itself to His Majesty’s Government, It is essential that there should be British representatives on the board of the Bagdad Railway, and His Majesty’s Govern ment attach importance to an assurance from the German Government that they will use their best endeavours to this end ; but it appears to them otiose to enter in the Convention into the technical formalities which the admission of such representatives may entail. Herr von Gwinner explained to Mr. Parker at the German Embassy on the 7th June, 1913, that their admission could only take place in a manner such as is suggested in Prince Lichnowsky’s note of the 16th July; 1913, and, subject to the successful formation of a British group, His Majesty’s Government intimated p- j n 3 1that the arrangements indicated would be satis factory. While they adhere to this position, they are bound to state that the legal advice which they have obtained respecting the bearing of the statutes of the Bagdad Railway Company and of the provisions of Turkish company law on the question is not quite in accord with the view then expressed by Herr von Gwinner. In this connexion it must be remarked that the terms outlined by Herr von Gwinner to Sir H. Babington Smith on the 14th June, 1913, are not such as are likely, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, to encourage British financial participation in the undertaking. The British subscribers are to be required to pay for their shares in full at par, whereas the original shareholders paid actually only one-half of the nominal value of their shares, the remainder being credited to them out of the profits on the construction of the first section of the railway—• a course which seems open to criticism on purely financial grounds. Whilst as regards participa tion in the profits arising from the construction and working of the railway, British shareholders would thus be in a less favourable position than the original subscribers, they are to be required to put themselves in the same position as original subscribers as regards the very onerous obliga tions of the syndicate for realising the Govern ment bonds. If substantial British financial participation in the enterprise is desired, His Majesty’s Government trust that the German Government will use their influence with the Bagdad Railway Company to secure an appreci able modification of the terms suggested. As regards article 2 certain changes have been made, with a view to greater clearness, in the lettering and numbering of the. several clauses and sub-clauses : it will be observed that no alteration of wording is made in clause (a), sub sections (i) and (ii), or in the first paragraph of sub-section (iii) ; but His Majesty’s Government are unable to concur in the proposal that German capital should be represented by directors on the board of any railway which might be built from Basra (Zobeir) to the Persian Gulf. Such. a proposal, as has already been pointed out, is in direct conflict with section 2 (b) of the memorandum of the 7th May, 1913 : it also appears to His Majesty’s Govern ment misleading and inequitable to stipulate [19C3 p—1] C6 that German representation on such a line should he similar as regards conditions and proportion to any British participation on the hoard of the Bagdad Bailway; the counterpart of any such British participation as may he arranged is rather to be found in German participation in the proposed Biver Navigation Company. His Majesty’s Government attach great im portance to all the stipulations which now appear in italics in article 2, clause (a), section (iv) of the British counter-draft being “adhered to” by the German Government in the present Anglo- German Convention, even though they may in the first place be the subject of agreement between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Bail way Company. Clauses (b) and (c) of article 2 provide for a British participation, both in the capital and directorate of the company or companies of the ports of Basra and Bagdad, and in the contracts for construction and maintenance, of 40 per cent, of the whole. Such a percentage is, according to Prince Lichnowsky’s note of 16th July, what the Bagdad Bail way Company are prepared to concede to British interests ; as British participation in the port of Basra up to 50 per cent, is not conceded, as suggested in the British note of the 18th September, 1913, His Majesty’s Government now revert to the proposal for British participa tion in both ports. Clause (d) of article 2 appears very desirable in order to ensure complete equality of treat ment. . Clauses (a) and (b) of article 3 have not been altered. The German Government express a wish that two changes should be made in clause- (c) of article 3, viz., that the words “ in Ottoman territory east of Aleppo ” should be substituted for “ in the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad,” and that the words “or in contradiction with that Company’s existing rights ” should be inserted after the words “ the Bagdad Bailway Company’s lines.” His Majesty’s Government regret that they cannot possibly agree to an extension of the geographical area under this clause ; they have had very great hesitation in agreeing even to the area originally suggested, having regard to the established position of British trade and influence in the provinces specified, but they certainly could.cot agree to mortgage the future as regards any line which might, at some distant date and under wholly altered conditions, possibly when the Bagdad Railway system is fully developed, he projected from the Mediterranean to Lower Mesopotamia. His Majesty’s Government understand that no project for a competing line with the Bagdad Railway from any point on the Mediterranean is •at present under contemplation, and that, as regards the Aleppo-Meshene project, nothing beyond a purely negative obligation has been assumed by the Ottoman Government. As regards the second alteration of wording- suggested in this clause, His Majesty’s Govern ment are prepared to adopt it subject to the insertion of the word “ either ” after “ railway undertakings,” and provided a satisfactory settle ment respecting the oil concessions in Mosul and Bagdad is reached, as they trust may be the case, before the signature of this Convention. His Majesty’s Government do not consider that there is any parallel in fact between German participation in the River Navigation Company and British participation in the ports of Bagdad and Basra : if it is desired to establish a parallel it should be sought, due regard being had to the relative magnitude of the two concerns, between German representation in the River Navigation Company and British representation in the Bagdad Railway Company, which, under the convention of 1903, includes concessions for the ports of Bagdad and Basra. His Majesty’s Government could in no case agree to the wording of article 4, clause (b) of the German counter-draft of the 3rd November, auy more than they could to that of article 2, clause (d) of the same document: they consider it abso lutely indispensable that British participation in the ports should be fixed in precise terms in the convention itself at 40 per cent, of the whole, and that German participation in the navigation should be expressly limited in the convention itself to a stated maximum ; they are further of opinion that the real facts of the agreement would have to be revealed eventually in Parlia ment and that no object would therefore be gained by their temporary obscuration. If, however, the German Government are anxious to maintain a spectacular parallel, perhaps the wording of article 4, clause (b) of thecounter-draft now enclosed might serve the- purpose in view. In agreeing not to oppose German participation, to the extent indicated, in the River Navigation Company, His Majesty’s Government take formal note of the assurances contained in the German Ambassador’s com munication of the 16th July, 1913, to the effect, that the German Government does not aim at any combination which could endanger effective British control of the navigation, and that the- German Government would therefore be prepared to receive favourably any proposals about voting arrangements which would seem to His Majesty’s Government desirable in order to assure the effective British control of the River Navigation Company. It will be observed that clause' (c) (i) of article 4 has been amended in form, and that the time limit of. five years is re-inserted. His Majesty’s Government attach cardinal importance to a specific limitation in the duration of the rights of the Bagdad Railway Company under article 9 of the convention of 1903 ; they must, in pursuance of section 3 of the memorandum of the 7th May, 1913, continue to press for such a limitation, which is not moreover inconsistent with the terms of agreement between the Bagdad Railway Company and either the “ Societe de Transports fluviaux ” or Messrs. Lynch Brothers. Sir E. Grey would add that he understands that Messrs. Lynch Brothers are prepared, so far as they are concerned, to conclude an arrange ment such as that contemplated under article 4 clause (c) (ii). The changes in article 5 (b) have already been explained in substance in Sir E. Grey’s memoran dum of the 25th November, 1913 ; slight verbal changes have since been made with the object of greater precision. His Majesty’s Government, after the most careful consideration, are not able to agree to stipulations such as are contained in articles 5 a and 7 of the German counter-draft of the 3rd November ; but they would be willing to agree that article G of the British counter-draft should be- interpreted, so far as possible, in the light of the recommendations of the 9th September, 1913, and that these recommendations should be embodied in the explanatory note : they understand, how ever, from Hakki Pasha that the specific revenues named in section II of those recommendationshave already been earmarked by anticipation for another purpose—a subject upon which Djavid Bey may possibly be able to throw more light. While resolutely opposed, for the practical reasons explained in Sir E. Grey’s memorandum of the 18th September, 1913, to the system of dual control which a ‘‘ comite de surveillance would entail, His Majesty’s Government have made a considerable modification in the wording of article 6 in order to meet the criticisms of the German Government, and they earnestly trust that the draft in its present form wall be accept able. A copy of the Auglo-Turkish declaration, lespecting the rights enjoyed by the nationals of the Treaty Powers in Turkey, is enclosed. In order that the document which formed the enclosure in Sir E. Grey’s memorandum of the 25th November, 1913, may exactly correspond vdth the present British counter-draft, a revised version is transmitted herewith. In conclusion, and while expressing the hope that these negotiations may be completed and the Anglo-German Convention signed in the course of next month, His Majesty’s Government would again draw the attention of the German Government to the desiderata of the Smyrna- Aidin Railway Company, which, if dealt with on a sympathetic and broad basis would, they confidently believe, contribute to the ultimate benefit both of the Smyrna-Aidin and the Anatolian Raihvay systems.

His Britannic Majesty ' 1 s Government and the Imperial German Government will use their best endeavours to secure that the Shatt-d-Arab shall be brought into and permanently kept in a satisfactory state of conservancy in order that sea-going vessels may always be assured of free and easy access to the port of Basra, and to secure, further, that the navigation on the Shatt- el-Arab shall permanently be kept open for sea-going vessels, and be carried on on terms of absolute equality for the vessels of all nations, without regard either to the nationality of the vessels or to their cargoes. Article 6. The Imperial German Government having taken note of the Anglo-Tnrkish Convention of under which the free navigation of the Shatt- el-Arab is assured to the shipping of all nations and a commission is established for the execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of its channel and for its maintenance and for other like purposes set out therein, and being of opinion that the provisions of the Convention are conducive to the best interests of international commerce, will, so long as the duties imposed upon the Commission by the said Convention are satisfactorily carried out, uphold the Con vention, and will undertake that German subjects and German shipping shall comply therewith, and with all regula tions issued by the Commission, and shall duly discharge all obligations pro perly imposed upon them in pursuance of the provisions of the said Convention.

Article 6. (a.) The Imperial German Government having taken note of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of under which the free navigation of the Shatt- el-Arab is assured to the shipping of all nations and a commission is established for the execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of its channel and for its maintenance and for other like purposes set out therein, and being of opinion that the provisions of the Convention are conducive to the best interests of international commerce, will, so long as the duties imposed upon the Commission by the said Convention are satisfactorily carried out, uphold the Con vention, and will undertake that German subjects and German shipping shall comply therewith, and with all regula tions issued b} r the Commission, and shall duly discharge all obligations pro perly imposed upon them in pursuance of the provisions of the said Convention.16 German Counter-draft. It is, nevertheless, understood that this stipulation in no wise affects the privileges and immunities granted to the German Empire by the Capitulations. A “ Comite de Surveillance ” shall be established composed of those foreign consuls resident at Basra whose flag is represented by steamship lines regularly trading with that port. The “ Comite ” shall correspond directly with the River Commission, to be established by the Imperial Ottoman Government, on all matters affecting the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab and the dues to be levied on that river; it is, however, understood that the functions of the 11 Comite” shall be advisory and not executive. The “Comite” will see that dues shall be imposed, not for the mere fact of navi gation, but only for repaying sums actually spent on impi-ovements in the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab and harbour facilities. They shall in no case exceed 1 fr. per registered ton (the dues to cover the coming in and going out of the same vessel); any dues shall be levied on a basis of absolute equality without regard to the nationality of sea-going vessels or their cargoes. r '’ Article 7. The preceding arrangements for the final settlement of all questions connected with the Bagdad Railway shall cease to be operative if the Shatt-el-Arab, after a reasonable time, has not been brought into British Counter-draft. The Imperial German Government take note in this connection of the declaration y signed on the and attached to the said Convention, to the effect that articles 7 and 8 of the above Convention do not affect the rights enjoyed in the Ottoman Empire by the nationals of the Treaty Powers. His Britannic Majesty s Government on their part undertake that they will not, without a preliminary agreement with the Imperial German Government, consent to the imposition of dues exceeding 1 franc per registered ton. (6.) If at any time any of the Govern ments most interested by reason of the magnitude of their shipping on the Shatt-el-Arab are of opinion that the duties imposed upon the Commission are not satisfactorily carried out, or that the reasonable requirements of the commerce of the river in matters within the com petence of the Commission are not adequately met, and if the Commission in such case has not seen its way to give effect to important recommendations laid before it in the interests of shipping, with the object of removing the above-mentioned causes of complaint, Ills Britannic Ma jesty's Government will use their good offices with the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment to ensure the reference to a Board of Enquiry of the questions whether in any particular respects the duties of the Com mission have not been satisfactorily carried out, and whether there is good ground for thinking that the Commission, if main tained, will not be able to provide for the reasonable requirements of the commerce of the river. This Board shall consist of five mem bers to be drawn from the Powers most interested by reason of the magnitude of their shipping in the Shatt-el-Arab; the Ottoman member of this Commission shall be the President. The Board of Enquiry shall, mdess the time is extended with the consent of all parties, publish its report within four months of its appointment.

Sir Edward Grey to German Charge d'Affaires. • e presents his compliments to the German Charge d’Affaires, and, with reference to the draft, communicated by Herr von Kiihlmann on the 14th November, of the proposed agreement between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Ottoman Government, has the honour to transmit the accompanying counter-draft, which, in so far as British interests are concerned, appears to His Majesty’s Govern ment to meet the requirements of the situation. A sentence has been added to article 1 so as to bring that article into accord with the corresponding stipulation in the Anglo-German draft. No changes are made in articles 2 and 3. Article 4, as drawn in the German draft, is impossible of being carried into execution. In the first place, a vessel drawing 24 feet would require a depth of ^ fib© river; in the second place, as the depth on the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab is, as explained in Sir E. Grey’s memorandum of the 23rd August, only 11 f® 6 ! 1 low water springs, a depth of 24 feet over the bar cannot be attained except at high-water springs, and, even so, such a depth (24 feet) must be regarded as a desirable consummation rather than as an assured possibility. Foi this reason His Majesty s Government consider that it would serve no useful purpose, and would indeed form ulate an impossible condition, if a more positive or unqualified woidmg than that contained in the British counter-draft were adopted. . ^ P^r^graph has been added to article 5 in order to avoid a conflict of jurisdiction which might otherwise arise. There is no change in article 6. A paragraph has been added to article 7 so as to render it more complete. Article 8 has been modified so as to be more in accord with the British counter- draft of the 18th September of the Anglo-German agreement. The final paragraph has a dded after consultation with Lord Inchcape, the concessionnaire for the River Navigation Company under the Turkish declaration of the 29th July, 1913. His Lordship is fully prepared to provide, on terms to be mutually agreed, all reasonable facilities to the Bagdad ^ Railway Company ; but His Majesty’s Government, having regard especially to section 3 of the proposals made on the 7th May, 1913, would be unable t° assent to the grant outside Bagdad of such rights as are contemplated in article 8 of the German counter-draft communicated on the 14th November.

My ^ KiiMmann, _ Foreign Office, November 24, 1913. YOU will remember that our official note of the 18th September contained a paragraph about the desiderata of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway, and that we gave reasons which we felt sure would enable us to count upon the co-operation of the German Government in bringing about a favourable settlement. For the sake of convenience I enclose a copy of the paragraph. lour note of the 3rd November to Sir E. Grey contained no reference to this subject, but you explained private 7 to me that Herr von Gwmner was discussing the subject with Djavid Bey at Berlii , and that though nothing definite could be said for the moment, the German Government hoped that negotiations were tending towards a favourable conclusion. This news w as particularly gratifying, for the Smyrna-Aidin line being the sole remaining line under British management in Turkey, we are particularly desirous that it should not be barred from development in its own region of natural though limited expansion, and we felt sure that the arguments advanced in our official note of the 18th September would appeal to the German Government. We have, not withstanding the large proportion of British trade in relation to that of other countries m Asiatic Purkey, taken a back seat in regard to tne large schemes of railway development recently under discussion, and we have done our best to promote a settlement satisfactory to others. . . Such being the case, we do consider that our requests with regard to the Smyrna- Aidm Railway Company are very moderate ; and it is because a hitch has apparently occurred at Berlin with regard to the desiderata of that Company that I am writing this private letter to you. I am most anxious that the difficulty should be overcome as I know what an unfavourable impression a breakdown of this Smyrna-Aidin negotiation would create here. Hakki Pasha tells me privately that_ he learns from Djavid Bey that the German Company is only willing to agree to a junction of the Smyma-Aidin and Anatolian systems on terms which would impose a very heavy and even prohibitive financial sacrifice upon the Ottoman Government and that as regards the other desiderata of the Smyrna—Aid in Company the attitude of the German Company, except in minor details, is one of non-possumus. This attitude, before which the Ottoman Government may very well be helpless, would if persisted in not only paralyse the extension of the Smyrna—Aidin lines^ in their legitimate sphere, but it would debar the company from navigating on certain lakes even though this could be done without any substantial prejudice to German irrigation projects, and it would condemn large tracts of country to remain without the benefits of railway communication. What we do feel especially is that at the very moment when we are asked by the German Government to enter into a formal engagement in no way to oppose the successful execution of a great trunk railway system by German interests, the modest, legitimate, and indeed necessary natural development of our one little remaining railway in Turkey should be blocked by those very German interests, and by those interests alone. If you could place yourself for a moment in our position, I think you would see the inequity of this. I feel sure that the representation, as here explained, of how we regard the whole question has only to be made in the right quarter in Berlin for a speedy settlement to be reached, and I am also convinced that you will understand how much importance we attach to the inclusion of this matter amongst those others in regard to which we are reaching a complete understanding. ALWYN PARKER. 5 DEC 1913 ! —— [1930 aa —2]Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from Memorandum dated September 18, 1913. HIS Majesty’s Government trust, however, that the concession offered unde£ clause (c), in the interests of the Bagdad Railway Company, will induce that compa^V and the affiliated Anatolian Railway Company, to adopt a conciliatory and favourable attitude towards certain desiderata of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company. These desiderata, which have been placed before the Ottoman Government, include an option for an eventual junction of that company’s line with the Anatolian Company s system, on conditions to be mutually agreed between the two companies. Inasmuch as the Anatolian Railway Company is already connected with Smyrna by the Smyrna- Cassaba Company’s line, it would seem that there can be no objection of principle to such a junction as that proposed with the Smyrna-Aidin Company’s system, and to the establishment of facilities for through traffic. His Majesty’s Government feel that they can, with the more assurance, claim the co-operation of the German Govern ment in bringing about such a settlement, as the Smyrna-Aidin line is the only remaining railway under British management in Turkey. They are further persuaded that, in considering this very moderate request, the German Government will not overlook the fact that, in the recent adjustment of certain railway claims in Turkey, His Majesty’s Government have not only refrained for the present from claiming fresh railway concessions in favour of British subjects, but have even furthered, to the best of their ability, the adjustment in question.ide an ipany’s smucli Ma nciple n, and it feel )vem- 1 only aaded l not rky, resh best [This is tfee Property of Sig Britannic Majestys Gover”^^ 1 ^ ] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

I HAVE tire honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 14th instant, in which you state that, as the negotiations between Germany, Great Britain, and Turkey relative to the Bagdad Railway are to form one whole, and as it appears highly desirable that the arrangements incorporated in the different treaties and conventions should exactly correspond, it seems expedient for the present merely to initial the agreements with the Turkish Government, in order that it may be easier to insert any necessary alterations in order to bring about complete conformity. You add that, for this reason, the German Government will for the present only initial the agreements to be concluded with Djavid Bey at Berlin In conveying to you the thanks of His Majesty’s Government for this communica tion, I have to inform you that the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government relating to railways in Asiatic Turkey will not be signed yet ; but the agreements relating to the Euphrates and Tigris navigation concession and to the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Commissiou were, as 1 have already informed his Highness the German Ambassador privately, signed some months ago. In accordance, however, with the semi-official statement which his Highness made some time ago, that the German Government would regard it as very conciliatory if His Majesty’s Government did not publish their agreements with Turkey pending the conclusion of the Anglo-German agreement, His Majesty’s Government will defer such publication for some weeks, though they desire to lay papers before Parliament reassembles, and they therefore trust that all the agreements may be concluded before the 31st December, 1913. I have to state further that His Majesty’s Government are in full agreement with the German Government as to the importance of complete concordance, and they are also of opinion that any agreements now under discussion with Djavid Bey or Hakki Pasha in which the three Powers—Germany, Turkey, and Great Britain—are interested, should be merely initialled pending direct discussion between Germany and Great Britain. In conclusion, I have to add that I hope to furnish you at an early date with the observations of His Majesty’s Government on the German counter-draft, which you were good enough to communicate to this Department, of the proposed agreement between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company.

THE question has been raised by interested parties in Germany whether the harbour and ferry boats of the Bagdad Railway at Basra would be liable to any shipping dues. According to the wording of the Anglo-Turkish Convention respecting navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab, and especially according to the decisions of the conference of experts held at the Foreign Office on the 9th September last (section 2, paragraph 1 : “ Dues will be levied equally upon all steamships which cross the bar at the entrance of the river ”), there is, in the opinion of the German Government, no doubt that steamers plying on the Shatt-el-Arab without crossing the bar remain exempt from all dues. In view of the importance in principle of this point, the Imperial Government would be grateful to learn that His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment share this view. I have, &amp;c. KUHLMANN.

Ta^ P&amp;rhups there might he a schedule giving a definition of the 'system'* I think the last four lines of the British draft should remain in the text* They seem more import ant in view of the substitution of 'system' for 'railway'. (b) . 'agree to' is not so good from the point of view of the British public as 'will not oppose'. (c) cannot be omitted, because the British group must be guaranteed its rep resentation. The Ge man audition is otiose, since we under stood that directors cannot be appointed ewe ep t as rep res en tat ives of capital. I do not object to it for } r r. Parker's reason: we may as well be as cordial as possible as regards the mainline, which is on a different footing from the Bagdad^ Basra extension. I object because the Germans are trying to make out that we want participation in the cap ital fo r its y own sake, in oraer to secure for themselves corres ponding participation in the Basra ^section (art. 2c). As regards the latter, they do not attempt to reply to our ar ument that the navigation (in which they now claim 20w as the irreducible minimum) is thethe proper counterpart to the Bagdad Railway. And the result is that they get two quids for one quo - a fact which they attempt to ohscmce hy creating a false 'parallelism' between port and navigation in 2b and 4d. If the Foreign Office cannot resist their claim, I suggest that the British representation on the Bagdad Railway proper should be limited to one director* His only functions are to act as a spy. Bat of course there may be practical difficulties in having only one spy - he might not always be able to attend meetings. Art. 2 (d) . We can surely not agree to 'not less than 20-' even on the Ambassador 1 s word that he means 4Cf?o. It is true that und'er the original concession the port would have been built by the Qompany and we should not - have participated at all. But the whole essence of the present position is that the original concession was a bad bargain which the Germans want to get out of, and for doing which they must pay. It must further be remembered that they have served us rather badly over the navigation. Having began by renouncing all claim to participate in it they are now claiming 'not less than 2 @ 7 o', and the 'parallelism' between , _ &lt; port and navigation which they now want to create is an attempt toA f r i obscure the real facts. I hope therefore that we shall stick out for our 5CFo. The last sub-clause in the British draft may be omitted provided that it does «£ appear in the agreement between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Turks. Art. 3(c). I agree with Mr. Parker. The threat of supporting such a line may some day be our only lever for securing that the Bagdad Railway Compafiy keeps its compact. Art. 4(b). I entirely, agree with Mr. Parker. Art. 5 (b) . The new condition (which the Turks are apparently ready to grant, since it appears inHakki's draft agreement with the Railway Company) seems rather a large order ana should certainly be resisted. It seems to mean that the Inchcape Coy. will have to face cut-throat compet ition on the Tigris between Mosul and Bagdad by means of combined railway and ferry rates. If allowed at all it should be limited to passengers and personal luggage. Art. 5 A. I agree with Mr. Parker. Art.6. I agree with Mr. Parker. The Germans must surely be acute enough to see that if there is no guarantee of the effectiveness of our proposal, there is equally little ofof that of a Comita whose functions are advisory and not executive. horeover it is a contradiction in terms to speak of a purely advisory committee n seeing that' something is or is not done* The object cf the German proposal is surely to have a source of embarrassment for us ready at nonet.

[50613] Minute by Mr. Parker. Provided it is expressly agreed, perhaps in the note explicative referred to by Herr von Kiihlmann, that the drafting of article 1, clause (a), does not in advance preclude His Majesty’s Government from opposing future variations of the concession, and provided His Majesty’s Government are furnished with authentic copies of all existing agreements between the Ottoman Government and the Germans, including the modifications now under discussion with Djavid Bey, I do not think exception need be taken to the words “ system ” and “ undertaking.” It is, however, essential that His Majesty’s Government should know precisely what they are asked to agree to. There does not seem the same objection to leaving out these words from the convention if they are inserted in the note explicative, which might advantageously define their somewhat ambiguous meaning. I think this is an improved wording in which His Majesty’s Government might certainly concur. The original idea of securing the appointment of two British directors was to guard against discrimination in rates; subsequently the German Government pointed out that in prac tice this could only be arranged by such [1930 g —7] No. 1. Jlerr von Kuhlmann to Sir Edward Grey. — {Be- ceived November 7.) (Confidential.) German Embassy, London, Dear Sir Edward, November 3, 1913. THE counter-draft to the British draft of the 18th September, 1913, which I had the honour to submit to-day, might require some confidential explanations, which I shall attempt to give in the following:— In article 1, clause (a), we would prefer to say in the seventh line “ construction of the Bagdad Railway system,” because that would cover the main line and the branch lines granted by the concession, as they shall be finally settled between the German and Turkish Governments. The word “ Railway ” at the beginning of the ninth line of the English counter-draft to be replaced by “ Undertaking.” We would like the last part of article 1, begin ning with “under” and ending with “this clause,” to be transferred to the note explicative. Our legal advisers do not hold the opinion that by accepting this clause England would bind herself to support any future increase of Turkish customs because an increase might seem desirable in the interest of the Bagdad Railway, but we consider at the same time that it would, as would the spirit of this convention, prevent England from opposing existing revenue or increases of the customs, in principle already accepted by the Powers, being in part used for the Bagdad Railway. In clause (b), “ declare that they will not oppose ” might be replaced by “ agree to.” Clause (c). The Imperial Government is quite willing to use its influence to see that British capital should be admitted to the Bagdad Railway Company under fair and reasonable terms. The clause would then read as follows :— “ The Imperial German Government declare that they will use their best endeavours to secure that two British directors agreeable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government shall be admitted T ^ 14 NOV isle s’V- Copy to 14 NOV 1913 ! ras representatives of a group of British share holders to the Board of the Bagdad Railway Company.” The Imperial Government is of opinion that this clause might he left out altogether if a group of British shareholders can he foimed before the signature of this agreement. As for the election of the British directors, I am glad to see that the arrangements suggested in Prince Lichnowsky’s note are satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government. The German Government considers that clause (c), article 1, in its amended form should better be left out of the convention and put in the note explicative. If, however, His Majesty’s Government could not agree to this, but insisted on retaining this clause in the convention, the Imperial Government would agree to this, pro vided the second section of clause (c), article 2, which, according to Prince Lichmwwsky’s note of the 16th July, 1913, was to be put in the note explicative, would be restored to the text of the convention. The prospects laid by Herr von Gwinner before Sir H. Babington Smith on the 14th June, 1913, were, to use a financial expression, ground-floor terms as favourable as could be offered at that period. The Bagdad Railway Company will try to obtain from the Turkish Government more favourable terms. Any concession which they might be able to secure will be offered as a matter of course to the British group. In article 2, clause (d), the words “ 50 per cent” should be replaced by “not less than 20 per cent.” What Prince Lichnowsky said about our willingness to agree to a British participation of 40 per cent, is entirely maintained, but the Imperial Government attaches the greatest importance to this particular wording, and I would strongly recommend its acceptance. directors representing British sliareholders, and to this His Majesty’s Government agreed. I am, however, doubtful as to whether this text should be adopted. The words “ as repre sentatives of a group of British shareholders ” appearing in the body of the convention appear to lend the official support of His Majesty’s Government to active British par ticipation in the Bagdad Bail way—and such an attitude might, in view of the past history of the question, be difficult to defend. It is indeed matter for consideration whether, as the German Government suggest, clause (c) of article 1 should not be left out of the con vention and put in the note explicative. As very great importance is not, I believe, attached by the Board of Trade to the appointment of British directors at all (so far as discrimination against British trade is concerned) it might be best to omit all mention of such appointments even in the note explicative, thus leaving it open to British financiers to participate on their own terms as regards representation on the board. This would enable us to resist the German claim as embodied in the last paragraph of article 2, clause (c), and its insertion either in the convention or in the note explicative; that claim is one which the India Office are anxious should be resisted. * The expression “ground-floor terms” can seldom have been so flagrantly misapplied. Herr von Gwinner proposed to Sir H. Babington Smith, as regards British participation, terms far less favourable than those conceded to the Bagdad Bailway Company by their convention of 1903. It was this which prompted the remarks in the British note of 18th September, and in the reply these considerations should be emphasised. At the same time it is true that, owing to the war and other causes, the 1903 concession is financially less attractive than it was at the date of signature. Instead of 50 per cent, in the port of Basra, we are offered “ not less than 20 per cent.,” which includes participation in the construction contracts “ if any.” The expression “ not less than 20 per cent.” is retained merely to confuse the German public into believing that there is a parallel between article 2, clause {d), and article 4, clause (&amp;), but it is explained that Germany is still willing in point of fact to let us have 40 per cent. His Majesty’s Govern ment gave good reasons for asking for a 50 per cent, participation in their note of the 18th September. If now His Majesty’s Go vernment agree to 40 per cent, they might well only do so on condition of British par ticipation in the port of Bagdad as well as in that of Basra. Lord Inchcape considered par ticipation in Bagdad valueless ; but the point merits fresh consideration as opportunity for such participation now arises again, and in any case His Majesty’s Government should stipulate against discrimination as between vessels of different nationality at the railway port of Bagdad.3 It is true that this is not primarily a matter for an Anglo-German convention; but there is, nevertheless, some advantage in securing the German Government’s assent to such a stipula- ^|tion and for this reason it seems well to retain it. I do not think we can safely agree to the geographical definition, even if the Aleppo- Meskene question is settled. We could hardly mortgage the future as regards any line from the Mediterranean to Lower Mesopotamia ; and, as it is, I think we should attach to the con vention a map showing the limits of Bagdad and Mosul. As regards the words “ or in contra diction with that company’s existing rights,” I think we might agree to them subject to a satisfactory settlement of the Mesopotamian oil question. As 20 pey cent, is the maximum we could agree to as regards German participation in the river navigation (article 4, clause (b) ) it seems undesirable and indeed deceitful to adopt the wording “not less than” with regard to such participation. It would ultimately have to be explained in Parliament what the real under standing was, and it thus seems useless to adopt a wording which is not straightforward in the convention. Herr Zimmermann is, I under stand, the devoted parent of this ridiculous ■“ parallelism.” It is of great importance that we should secure a time limit; but it seems that we should now first aim at an arrangement as contemplated in the last paragraph of article 4 (c), and that negotiations to this end should be hastened. The last paragraph beginning with “ any ” and ending with “commission” could he left out. It is contained in the Anglo-Turkish Convention, and will be confirmed in the agreement between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Turkish Government. In article 3, clause (c), the Imperial Govern ment would like to see the words “ within the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad ” replaced by “in Ottoman territory east of Aleppo,” and after “ Bagdad Railway Company’s lines ” interpolated “ or in contradiction with that Company’s existing rights.” The first alteration is based on the belief that the wording proposed in the British counter- draft would not sufficiently protect the Bagdad Railway interests against the possibility of a competing line from some point of the Mediter ranean to Lower Mesopotamia beiug supported by His Majesty’s Government. It is hoped that the plan of constructing a line from Aleppo to Meskene can be successfully dealt with during the Franco-German negotiations about railways in Asia Minor. Article 4, clause (b), asks for a 20 per cent, participation in the shares of the River Naviga tion Company. This is the irreducible minimum we must ask for, and nothing less, but this participation could, in the opinion of the Imperial Government, lead to a successful conclusion of this agreement. The German Government lays great stress on the wording proposed, which establishes some sort of parallelism with clause (d), article 2, but it is at the same time understood that the wording does not mean to establish any claim beyond the 20 per cent, share we ask for. This 20 per cent, share is meant to represent a permanent proportion of the share capital, so that in case of future changes in the capitalisation this proportion shall always be maintained. In article 4, clause (c), we propose to strike out the words beginning with “ not continue ” till “ case they shall.” The Bagdad Railway interests are quite willing to let their transport privileges on the river lapse after the completion of the main line to Basra, but do not see their way to agree to a fixed time limit, as proposed in the British counter-draft. It is hoped, however, that some arrangement, as contemplated in the last section of clause (c), might be concluded before the signature of this * *4 convention, rendering the proposed time limit altogether unnecessary. In article 5, clause (b), it is proposed to insert after “to use” the words “at their stations on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates and. We propose to restore the contents of our former article 5 as article 5 a, or clause (c) of article 5, British counter-draft, in the wording of our counter-proposal. In view of the paramount importance which the Shatt-el-Arab has foi our interests, being the only access by sea to the terminus of the great railway in which so much capital has been sunk, it is necessary for us to have a direct assurance from His Majesty’s Government that the river will be kept in good conservancy and open under terms of absolute equality. In article 6 we agree to the first section, but would like a clause added expressly stating that the rights, acquired by the capitulations, shall not be impaired. This proposed addition goes beyond anything conceded in the Bagdad Railway Convention^, of 1903, and, from the wording (as read to me r by Hakki Pasha) of a draft agreement between the Company and the Ottoman Government, it is evidently the aim of the Company to secure thereby rather extensive rights of navigation. I think the limits of such navigation rights, if conceded, should be carefully restricted, and possibly the services in question might be performed by Lord Inchcape’s Company in which the Germans are to participate. His Majesty’s Government might possibly undertake to use their best endeavours to this end, but it is considered objectionable to admit the German Government to any share of responsibility. The “ recommendations ” made at the in formal conference of the 9th September, 1913,. might be the interpretation of this article, and might be embodied in an annex to this- convention. This may, subject to any observations of the^ Legal Adviser, be agreed to as it is covered by the additional convention signed by Hakki Pasha on the 21st October. Possibly the words “ in no other respects ” should be substituted for “ in no wise.” The Imperial Government thinks that the machinery provided by the second section of article 6 is open to a good deal of criticism, and proposes, if their original article 6 should be accepted, striking out the words from the Shatt- el-Arab shall” to “ of Basra and.” Turkey has not ratified The Hague Convention of the 18th October, 190v. There does not seem, therefore, to be any real guarantee that the British Govern ment would in every case succeed in making the Turkish Government accept the reference to a Commission of Enquiry, as proposed in the British counter-draft. Such a Commission seems, in the opinion of the German Govern ment, a rather clumsy instrument, and prob ably there would be a good deal of delay before any decision could be arrived at. The decision of the Commission would m no way have the character of an arbitral decision or any binding character whatsoever. The decision leaves, as stated in article 35 of The Hague Convention, absolute liberty to the parties con cerned. It seems, therefore, that if after pro tracted negotiations the Commission of Enquiry Prom oral explanations of Herr von Kiihl- mann it is understood that he personally is strongly opposed to a “ comit4 de surveillance,”' which, he recognises, would be unsatisfactory in practice. It seems therefore advisable to concentrate on the improvement of article 6 of the British draft so as to meet the German criticisms as here expressed. Perhaps Mr. Hurst would suggest an amended wording.5 This should be considered in the light of articles 11 and 16 of the Anglo-Turkish Shatt- el-Arab Convention of the 29th July, 1913. Article 7 seems very objectionable. (Herr von Kiihlmann stated that our request (see note covering our draft of 18th September) concerning the Smyrna-Aidin Railway was under consideration at Berlin and it was hoped a favourable settlement would be reached.) I venture to suggest that the most expeditious way of dealing with the German proposals would be for them to be sent, with this minute, to the India Office and Board of Trade with the suggestion that a conference should meet early next week to discuss the nature of the reply. It is important to conclude the agree ment as soon as possible. A. P. Foreign Office, November 11, 1913. should give a decision unfavourable to the Com mission, there would be under the scheme as it stands now no guarantee whatever that the Riverain Commission either changes the objec tionable policy or is replaced by a body better adapted for the needs of commerce and naviga tion. The Imperial Government, for the same reasons that have led to ask for the retention of article 5 A, attaches great importance to get a direct undertaking from His Majesty’s Govern ment concerning dues on the Shatt-el-Arab. The desire to retain the second part of our article 6 beginning with “ That dues shall ” has no doubt contributed to the desire to let our article 6 stand as proposed by us. Therefore, it seems advisable, in case the retention of our article 6 should not be agreed to, to attach its second part to article 5 a. In article 7 the Imperial Government agree to the proposal of the British counter-draft, but would like to see clause (d) retained in a form given in our counter-draft. Article 8 is agreed to.

Herr von Kuhlmann to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 7.) (Confidential.) Dear Sir Edward, German Embassy, London, November 3, 1913. THE counter-draft to the British draft of the 18th September, 1913, which I had the honour to submit to-day, might require some confidential explanations, which I shall attempt to give in the following:— In article 1, clause (a), we would prefer to say in the seventh line “ construction of the Bagdad Railway system,” because that would cover the main line and the branch lines granted by the concession, as they shall be finally settled between the German and Turkish Governments. The word “Railway” at the beginning of the ninth line of the English counter-draft to be replaced by “ Undertaking.” ^ We would like the last part of article 1, beginning with “ under ” and ending with ‘ ltd 8 clause, to be transferred to the note explicative. Our legal advisers do not hold the opinion that by accepting this clause England would bind herself to support any future increase of Turkish customs because an increase might seem desirable in the interest of the Bagdad Railway, but we consider at the same time that it would, as would the spirit of this convention, prevent England from opposing existing revenue or increases of the customs, in principle already accepted by the Powers, being in part used for the Bagdad Railway. In clause (6), “ declare that they will not oppose ” might be replaced by “agree to. Clause (c). _ The Imperial Government is quite willing to use its influence to see that British capital should be admitted to the Bagdad Railway Company under fair and reasonable terms. The clause would then read as follows:— “ The Imperial German Government declare that they will use their best endeavours to secure that two British directors agreeable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government shall be admitted as representatives of a group of British shareholders to the Board of the Bagdad Railway Company.” The Imperial Government is of opinion that this clause might be left out altogether if a group of British shareholders can be formed before the signature of this agree ment. As for the election of the British directors, I am glad to see that the arrange ments suggested in Prince Lichnowsky’s note are satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government. The German Government considers that clause (c), article 1, in its amended form should better be left out of the convention and put in the note explicative. If, however, His Majesty’s Government could not agree to this, but insisted on retaining this clause in the convention, the Imperial Government would agree to this, provided the second section of clause (c), article 2 , which, according to Prince Lichnowsky’s note of the 16th July, 1913, was to be put in the note explicative, would be restored to the text of the convention. The prospects laid by Herr von Gwinner before Sir H. Babington Smith on the 14th June, 1913, were, to use a financial expression, ground-floor terms as favourable as could be offered at that period. The Bagdad Railway Company will try to obtain from the Turkish Government more favourable terms. Any concession which the^ might be able to secure will be offered as a matter of course to the British group. In article 2, clause (d), the words “ 50 per cent.” should be replaced by “not less than 20 per cent.” What Prince Lichnowsky said about our willingness to agree to a British participation of 40 per cent, is entirely maintained, but the Imperial Government attaches the greatest importance to this particular wording, and I would strongly recommend its acceptance.

Article 4, clause (b), asks for a 20 per cent, participation m the shares of the River Navigation Company. This is the irreducible minimum we must ask for, and nothing less but this participation could, in the opinion of the Imperial Government, lea a successful conclusion of this agreement. The German Government lays great stress on the wording proposed, which establishes some sort of parallelism wi )’ article 2, but it is at the same time understood that the wor dmg c l° es n °t establish any claim beyond the 20 per cent, share we ask for. This 20 per cent share is meant to represent a permanent proportion of the share capital, so that m case future changes in the capitalisation this proportion shall always be mamtamea. ^ In article 4, clause (c), we propose to strike out the words beginning wi n continue ” till “ case they shall. ” . ., The Bagdad Railway interests are quite willing to let their transport privileges on the river lapse after the completion of the main line to Basra but do not see tlieir way to agree to a fixed time limit, as proposed in the British counter-draft. It is hoped, however, that some arrangement, as contemplated m the last section o clause (c), might be concluded before the signature of this convention, rendering tlie proposed time limit altogether unnecessary. , « n • In article 5, clause (b), it is proposed to insert after “ to use the words at their stations on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates and.” . , _ We propose to restore the contents of our former article 5 as article DA, or clause (c) of article 5, British counter-draft, in the wording of our counter-proposal. In view of the paramount importance which the Shatt-el-Arab has for our interests, being the only access by sea to the terminus of the great railway m which so much capital has been sunk, it is necessary for us to have a direct assurance from ffis Majesty’s Government that the river will be kept in good conservancy and open under terms of absolute equality. _ . , In article 6 we agree to the first section, but would like a clause added expressly stating that the rights, acquired by the capitulations, shall not be impaired. The Imperial Government thinks that the machinery provided by the second section of article 6 is open to a good deal of criticism and proposes, if their original article 6 should be accepted, striking out the words from the “Shatt-el-Arab shall to “ of Basra and.” Turkey has not ratified The Hague Convention of the 18th October, 1907. There does not seem, therefore, to be any real guarantee that the British Government would in every case succeed in making the Turkish Government accept the reference to a Commission of Enquiry, as proposed in the British counter-draft. Such a Commission seems in the opinion of the German Government a rather clumsy instrument and probably there would be a good deal of delay before any decision could be arrived at. The decision of the Commission would in no way have the character of an arbitral decision or any binding character whatsoever. The decision leaves, as stated in article 35 of The Hague Convention, absolute liberty to the parties concerned. It seems, therefore, that if after protracted negotiations the Commission of Enquiry should give a decision unfavourable to the Commission, there would be under the scheme as it stands now no guarantee whatever that the Riverain Commission either changes the objectionable policy or is replaced by a body better adapted for the needs of commerce and navigation. The Imperial Government for the same reasons that have led to ask for the retention of article 5 A attaches great importance to get a direct undertaking from His Majesty’s Government concerning dues on the Shatt-el-Arab. . . . &lt; j The desire to retain the second part of our article 6 begining with “ That dues shall ” has no doubt contributed to the desire to let our article 6 stand as proposed by us. Therefore, it seems advisable in case the retention of our article 6 should not be agreed to, to attach its second part to article 5 a.In article 7 tlie Imperial Government counter-draft, but would like to see clause id} draft. v 7 agrees to the proposal of the British retained in a form given in our counter- Article 8 is agreed to.

His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Government will use their best endeavours to secure that the Shatt-el-Arab shall be brought into and permanently kept in a satisfactory state of conservancy in order that sea-going vessels may always be assured of free and easy access to the port of Basra, and to secure, further, that the navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab shall permanently be kept open for sea-going vessels, and be carried on on terms of absolute equality for the vessels of all nations, without regard either to the nationality of the vessels or to their cargoes. Article 6. Paragraph 1 unchanged. It is, nevertheless, understood that this stipulation in no wise affects the privileges and immunities granted to the German Empire by the Capitulations. A “Comite de Surveillance” shall be established composed of those foreign consuls resident at Basra whose flag is represented by steamship lines regularly trading with that port.

GREY presents his compliments to the German Charge d’Affaires and has the hononr to state, for the confidential information of the German Government, that Hakki Pasha has recently communicated to the Foreign Office a telegram which his Highness had received from Djavid Bey, at present in Berlin, asking for the full text of the declarations which, in the opinion of Ins Highness, should be signed by the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company with reference to the terminus of the line and cognate matters. Hakki Pasha, wishing to expedite the negotiation and to preclude all possibility of misunderstanding, has requested His Majesty’s Government to assist him in the preparation of a draft, and Sir E. Grey, with similar objects, has, as Herr von Kuhlmann is aware, authorised his Department to enter into informal, and mutually non committal, communication with the German Embassy on the subject. His Majesty’s Government now propose to inform Hakki Pasha forthwith that the following text appears to meet the case :— “ Article l er . La Societe du Chemin de Fer de Bagdad renonce a la concession de la construction et de 1’exploitation de I’embranchement partant de Basra (Zobeir) ou de tout autre point de la ligne et aboutissant a un point du Golfe Persique (article l er (4), de la convention du 20 fevrier (5 mars), 1903), ainsi qu’au droit de construire et exploiter un port a un point situe an Golfe Persique (article 23 de cette meme convention). “ Art. 2.

Les conventions relatives a ces ports et les statuts des societes a constituer contiendront des dispositions sauvegardant expresse- ment les droits de la Commission fluviale a etablir pour I’amelioration des conditions de navigation sur le Ohatt-el-Arab. Les conventions et statuts susmentionnes contiendront egalement des dispositions assurant aux marchandises transportees par voie dean et a celles transportees par chemin de fer un traitement identique. “ Art. 3.

Grey would be grateful if he could be informed as soon as possible whether this text commends itself to the German Government and, in the contrary case, if they would formulate their objections at their earliest convenience. Sir E.

It therefore seems just that they should contribute to the expenses of the Commission on a reduced scale—a point which can be discussed further with the German Government at an early date, should they desire to do so.

HIS Majesty’s Government Lave examined with close attention the counter-draft, communicated by the German Ambassador on the 16th July, 191o, of the proposed Anglo-German convention respecting the Bagdad Bailway and cognate matters ; they have also considered the various memoranda which accompanied this document, and the detailed explanations which His Serene Highness was good enough to furnish in a private note of the same date. Sir B. Grey now has the honour to submit a revised counter-draft, printed, for the sake of convenience, with the German counter-draft in parallel columns, and to deal with the several points which have been raised by referring, where necessary, seriatim to the articles of the British counter-draft. Y 26 SEP 1313;; uc - [1863 5—1] Article 1, Clause (a ).—The German Govern ment suggest that the words “ under the express condition that this should not cause any prejudice of a financial or economical nature ” might be omitted. His Majesty’s Government consider, however, that without such words the clause might be interpreted as committing them, uncon ditionally and indefinitely, to liability not to oppose any increases of the Turkish customs duties which might be proposed, or any alloca tions of specific revenues which might be claimed, if such increases or allocations were ever deemed desirable, either to provide further guarantees for, or in any other interest of, the Bagdad Railway Company. Article 1, Clause (b ).—His Majesty’s Govern ment note that the German Government would prefer the drafting of this clause to be in a positive rather than a negative form, though such a modification would not materially alter the nature of the obligation concurred. His B Copy to India 23 SEP 19132 Majesty’s Government have given this point careful consideration, but, on the whole, it appears to them expedient to retain the wording of the British counter-draft ; this wording corresponds, moreover, with the undertaking the German Government propose to give in article 4 (a) as regards the navigation of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. Article 1, Clause (c).—His Majesty’s Govern ment attach importance to the insertion of this provision. The undertaking to be given by the German Government under the proposed wording is merely that they will ‘ use their best endeavours ” for the purpose stated ; but His Majesty’s Government appreciate the technical difficulty that the German Government cannot theoretically ensure the election of the directors in question without the co-operation of the Bagdad Railway Company ; and they are accordingly prepared to agree that if and when a British group is formed, the arrangements sug gested in Prince Lichnowsky’s note would be satisfactory to them. The question, however, whether a British group can be successfully formed must necessarily depend on the financial conditions of participation. His Majesty’s Government accordingly rely upon the German Government using their powerful influence to prevent the imposition of such conditions by the Bagdad Railway Company as would make participation unattractive to British financiers, and so frustrate the object of the clause under discussion, viz., British representation on the directorate. They do not believe that the prospects laid by Herr von Gwinner before Sir H. Babington Smith on the 14th June, 1913, as to the conditions of British participation are likely to result in a settlement. Article 2.—The preamble of this article has been amended so as to meet the proposal embodied in clause (a) of article 7 of the German counter-draft, and in order that the conclusion of the proposed arrangement between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Ottoman Government may be treated as a preliminary to the signature of the Anglo-German convention, a point to which His Majesty’s Government attach primary importance. Article 2, Clause (a), corresponds to the German counter-draft. Article 2, Clause (b), corresponds to the German— Z'X*. . wmmmmmmmmmBntKtBi : -b~' ~ 3 counter-draft ; but His Majesty’s Government would, as the German Charge d’Affaires has already been informed, value an assurance (which might either be added to this clause, or given by an exchange of notes, should the German Government deem such a course to be preferable) that there will be effective publica tion of all rates and conditions on the Bagdad Railway and of all intended changes therein, and that the notice to be given of such changes will not be less than two months in the case of both increases and decreases. Article 2, Clause (c), corresponds to the German counter-draft. His Majesty’s Government have carefully considered the statement of Prince Lichnowsky that the German Government would attach importance to receiving a note confirming that, in the event of the construction of the Basra (Zobeir) Gulf branch, His Majesty’s Govern ment would take steps to secure that the Bagdad Railway Company is represented on the Board of the Company to be formed for the construction and working of the said line in the same manner as British capital will be represented on the Board of the Bagdad Railway Company. It appears, however, to His Majesty’s Govern ment that the British representation on the Bagdad Railway finds its counterpart in German participation in the river navigation, and that it is hardly reasonable that Germany should claim to participate in the latter and in an eventual branch of the railway to the Persian Gulf as well. His Majesty’s Government trust that this point will not be pressed. Article 2, Clause (d ).—His Majesty’s Govern ment understand from Prince Lichnowsky’s note, that while the German Government in their counter-draft suggest that British participation in the ports of Bagdad and Basra should not be less than 20 per cent., they are prepared to concede 4-0 per cent, if so desired. It will be observed that the British counter-draft omits all reference to British participation in the port of Bagdad, while claiming a British participation of 50 per cent., as regards capital, directorate and contracts, in the port of Basra. Having regard to the fact that no British participation is claimed in the Railway Company’s proposed port at Bagdad, and to the large proportion which British shipping at the port of Basra bears to that of the4 total shipping (the steam vessels entered and cleared at that port during the year 1912 having been 217 British, 12 German, 5 Russian, and 1 French), His Majesty’s Government confidently believe that the degree of participation claimed will be regarded as very moderate, and indeed as highly desirable in the general interests of the port. His Majesty’s Government further consider it desirable that the principal conditions as to the formation and operation of the port at Basra should be laid down in the present convention. Article 3, Clause (a), corresponds to the German counter-draft. Article 3, Clause (b), gives effect to article 3 of the original British draft of 10th June, 1913 : this article is ignored in the German counter draft, but it constitutes, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, a most important and essential condition of the present convention. Without it, the provisions of article 2, clause (a), and article 3, clause (a), are illusory, and might, if it were so desired, be rendered nugatory. Inasmuch as a principal object of His Majesty s Government in concluding the present convention is to guard against such a port or railway terminus on the Persian Gulf, except on conditions subject to their approval, they trust the German Government, who by reason of the railway interests of German subjects are specially concerned, will not take exception to this clause. It may be said without exaggeration that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government throughout the present negotiations has been largely deter mined by the belief that they were effectively providing against the contingency under discussion. Article 3, Clause (c).—His Majesty’s Govern ment recognise, however, that the German Government may feel some disinclination to agree to the provisions of article 3 of the British draft of the 10th June, 1913, if that article stands alone. They have accordingly redrafted article 3 in such a manner that clause (a) is a mutual undertaking, clause (6) is a German undertaking, and clause (c) is a British undertaking. Clause (c) may, in some measure, be regarded as a set-off against clause (b). Clause (c) is, moreover, designed to meet the object, under a more precise definition, of clause (c) of article 1 of the German counter-draft. Clause (c) of article 3 does not compare unfavour-6 monopoly, a fact which, is emphasised by article 3, clause (c). Moreover, a monopoly of navigation exists already, and it appears to His Majesty’s Government that Germany, who now has no rights on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates beyond the carriage of railway material during the period of construction, is losing nothing more than the prospect of participation in the very improbable event of Turkey throwing the rivers open, for which uncertain prospect she is, accord ing to article 4, to be compensated by an actual share in a very profitable if exclusive under taking. It seems to His Majesty’s Government, therefore, that the objection raised in Prince Lichnowsky’s note can be answered, and they do not feel able to amend the Anglo-Turkish declaration in the manner suggested. Article 4, clause (a ).—The second sub-clause of the German counter-draft appears, in these cir cumstances, to be superfluous, and it is, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, in itself objectionable, as appearing to put German and British interests on the rivers on an equality, a conclusion to which His Majesty’s Government could on no account assent, having regard to the fact that the rivers have been navigated by British vessels for well-nigh three centuries, and that such navigation has taken place by virtue of special and ancient firmans. An addition has, however, been made to clause (a) which, it is hoped, will secure to the German Government such further protection as they consider desirable. Article 4, clause (b ).—Prince Lichnowsky refers in his note to “ the desire to establish a parallel ” with British participation in the ports of Bagdad and Basra. The parallel would now be con fined to such participation in the latter port; but even so there would seem to be little analogy between participation in a single port company, and participation in the lucrative enterprise of extensive and exclusive river navigation. Notwithstanding the basis of agreement sug gested on the 7th May, 1913, His Majesty’s Govern ment are, after careful consideration, prepared to agree not to oppose G erman interests in acquiring not more than (as distinct from not less than) one- third of the share-capital allotted to Turkish interests in the Ottoman Company for river navigation. They are confident that this im portant concession, over and above the terms of agreement suggested in the memorandum of r f \the 7th May, 1913, will be borne in mind by the German Government in considering the points to which His Majesty’s Government, on their part, attach weight. Article 4, Clause (c).—His Majesty’s Govern ment attach cardinal importance to a specific limitation of five years, and to the reservations embodied in the British draft. But, in view of the final paragraph of this clause, they trust that an agreement of the nature indicated may be reached between the parties interested, in which case the wording of the clause in question could be revised. Article 5 of the British counter-draft calls for no explanations, except that the preamble has, so far as applicable, been based upon that of article 2. Article 6 corresponds to articles 5 and 6 of the German counter-draft. Having regard to the fact that the whole water way of the Shatt-el-Arab is Turkish, it appears to His Majesty’s Government that the wording of article 5 of the German counter-draft might perhaps somewhat offeud Ottoman susceptibilities. The wording of article 5 of the British draft of the 10th June, 1913, was based upon the fact that the Ottoman Government, recognising the practical services rendered through British agency in maintaining access to the port of Basra in the past, w T ere prepared to conclude an agree ment with His Majesty’s Government on the lines known to the German Government. His Majesty’s Government have considered very carefully the proposal to establish a “ comite de surveillance ” contained in article 6 of the German counter-draft, but they are persuaded that the inconvenience which would arise from the co-existence of two bodies would be detri mental to the interests of navigation. They confidently believe, however, that the wording of article 6 of the British counter-draft will, in effect, meet the points to which the German Government attach importance. Article 7.—His Majesty’s Government trust that this article may be suppressed for the reasons explained in the notes printed opposite the several clauses of the German counter-draft. They desire to conclude a definite and operative convention with the German Government, and not one which is to remain in suspended animation.8 Article 8 corresponds to the German counter- draft. His Majesty’s Government earnestly trust that the views expressed in this memorandum will command the willing assent of the German Government. They are persuaded that an Anglo-German understanding on the lines proposed will contribute to the permanent strength, the independence, and the economic development of the Ottoman Empire, and that this is an object to the attainment of which Great Britain and Germany can successfully and whole heartedly co-operate.
