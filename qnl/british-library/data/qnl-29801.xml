C, I shall be grateful to you if you will allow me to correspond with you on the subject of the night watchmen as I have had spoken to you onee in this matter. As you have now come to know that the Municipality maintains night watch on merchants stores in Muscat and Mtrah without any payment from them. A peeiod of one year has passed since the Municipality have been spending over three hundred rupees every month for this purpose. Do you think that it is justified that this should be a^ part of the duties of the Municipalty, which has no cocern with the watching of the merchants stores. The members of the Municipal Council have gone into this matter and have decided that unless the merchants pay the tax as fixed by the Municipal Council in accordance with the present situation, the night guards should be removed • Accordingly we may say that the merchants may be given the choice between having the watchmen if they pay the tax or no watchmen. Therefore we request you to agree with the decision of the Municipal Council. Thankkng you very much. U.E. /ff/'l—CONFIDENTIAL C ^ -i* V D.O. NO,. Vl $ -35/116.

AMERICAN MISSION HOSPITAL MUSCAT, OMAN S E, ARABIA VIA BOMBAY. Dear Captain Metcalf :iov. 21st. In answer to your letter regsnd— — ng municipal taxation on Mission property here in Mutrah I hasten to reply: Te have never been fcexed, except at the time of the purchase of this property, v'hen a sum v-as paid to the government v r hich I 'jpelie^e is the routine at the time of sale of property. I have alv;ays taken for granted that the government gave us immunity from taxation because y e are essent ially a charity institution to the extent that over two thirds of the patients treated here are treated free of charge. Every year ve treat several human derilicts that the municipality themselves or the V«ali send us for treatment. Ye have never charged nor been paid any fe s by the minicipality -or these ■^'rvices nor have we expected it but we vould be t-orprised and disappointed if the municipality, overlooking these services,should decide to lay a tax on this property. Nomof the Mission Hops.itals of our American Mission in the Gulf or India are charged municipal taxes * and in both Bahrain and Kuwait^vhen i served in those two places,p»44 the hos] ital &lt;J a*^mAf fee annually for the work done for public paupers sent to the hospital by the Municipalities of those two places. * 'flU. Verw sincerely yours,PERSONAL MJSCAT. 16th D«c«mb«r 1943. A© I v«rbally inform*cl Y«ur Highn«£s ytsttrday, fr»ra timt x# tim« complaints havo boon racoivod in this Consuxato from British aubjocts against tho lovy of cortain taxos by tho toali of Mattrah. My prodocossor was gisron a list of thoso taxos by Your Highnoss* Minister for External Affairs and they are as follows: m (a) Within the boundary of the market a tax of Re.l/- is chargeable for every three cubits for building. (b) Re.l/- is to be charged for every four cubits for building inside the “Sur*. (c) Re.l/- is payable for every six cubits for building outside the ^ur'. (d) A tax of Rs.5/- is to be paid for opening an outer door. (e) A tax of Rs.2/8/- is chargeable for opening every window outside (f) A tax of Re.l/- is to be paid for every foot of the length of a balcony. (g) A tax of Re.l/- is payable for each foot of the breadth of balconies. (h) fts.S/- are to be paid for digging a well. (i) 85 . 2 / 8 /- are to be paid for each ditch for used water or such other thing It is understood that these charges are levied on repairs as well as on original works. 2. Although at first sight they would appear a Municipal levy, it seems that they are in fact a Government tax. Further since they have been charged for some time, it is to be pre sumed that they have your approval. But could you kindly confirm these points ? 3.... His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman.3. As Your Highness is aware, under Treaty, no taxes can be taken from British subjects unless they are first made applicable to them through this Consulate. If therefore it is your wish to continue these taxes, v/ould you Kindly cause an official request to be made to me to have them applied to British subjects ? Any such reference may kindly indicate whether the taxes are to be a Government or Municipal concern. 4. tfhile on this subject^ Saiyid Hilai bin Badr Ccilled on me yesterday and explained that the Harasa tax, which i.s optional and which is paid by only a few people, had for that reason become uneconomic. He was therefore considering abolishing it but thought that he should first inform me since the safety of British subjects and their property is involved. Personally, I can see no useful purpose in retaining an unprofitable tax and since police are presumably on duty at night in both towns, the tax in any case appears redundant. But would Your Highness very kindly confirm this ? 5. There are two other taxes, date tax and fishing boat tax, which have not been legally applied to British subjects. Not that any complaints against them have been received and very few, if any, British subjects appear to be affected. At the same time, however, it seems desirable to regularise the position and if Your Highness agrees, would you kindly cause the necessary reference to be made V (l^.d0 MUSCAT The 27th December 1^43 4-5) I tliank you for your letter D.O # No # C/1576 dated the 6th December 1943 and for the aide memoire to our conversation of* the 3rd December 1943* I would liJfce to make one comment on item No.7 on the said aide memoire. In my opinion the question of the Hindu Community having no objection to the land being used for hospital does not arise here because they did not prove that the land belongs to them according to our itegulation of Immovable property for foreigners. I am enclosing herewith the above Regulation as I promised to send you, and hope it will clear the situa tion. I assure you that my government has no intention whatsoever to cause your subjects to relinquish immovable properties which are legally proved as theirs and they will be treated in this respect as any other foreigners In accordance with the Treaty. Captain R.D.N H.B.M^s C Muscat.Regulation Of Immovable property For Foreigners. All lands and immovable properties of any description belong No foreigner can claim the right of possessing any immovable property without being in possession of a legal document or documents duly registered in^local courts or in possession of document or documents which can be accepted by the local govern ment when produced. All foreigners are prohibited to purchase immovable properties of any description in the country. Ail disputes arising between a foreigner and a subject of the local government in connection with any immovable property shall be decided by the local ^courts whose decision shall be final.In such disputes the foreigner shall produce the neces sary legal document or documents to support his claim, failing which, his claim shall not be recognised and entertained. Lands, having buildings of any description on them, when in possession of any foreigner and in the absence of any claim by any subject of the Muscat Government shall be considered as that foreigner's property, but the Government reserves the Trv right to call on the foreigner, whenever it de^s necessary, to produce the document of his possession of th#se lands, failing cu which, the foreigner shall pay the ^nd rent now in force or according to the scale which may be established in future. Crown lands when held by a foreigner by a special permission from the Government are liable to payment of rent according to the present or future scale unless exempted from the same by the Sultan in person. Existing worship places i.e.temples and churches are recogni sed and exempt from payment of land rent. Territorial waters shall not be used by regular foreign* fishing boats for trade purposes unless those fishing boats pay the annual Fishing Tax.Note Any document not specifying that the land on which arty building already exists legally belongs to the owner of that building will justify the 'local government to reserve the right % of considering that land as its property, and of calling on the owner of the building to pay the land rent. This is applicable to the British as well as to the Muscat subjects. y-sNote on conversation with His Highness the Sultan on the 30th December 1943. 1. Arrangements for the disposal of work during the absence of His Highness in Dhofar were discussed and Hie Highness said he was writing to me. In general) except for one or two very important matters, his Minister for External Affairs will have full powers and will be assisted by the Military Adviser and the Director of Customs, the latter especially dealing with food and price control. 2. His Highness said that the leader of the Hindu community had not yet approached him regarding the selection of a new piece of land for the Hindu School in Matrah (the piece previously chosen was considered unsuitable as it was close to a mosque) but that when he did, His Highness did not anticipate that there would be any difficulties. 3. His Highness confirmed that he had given instructions that the Dahpu*s gun was to be sighted overlooking the harbour but understood that there were some technical difficulties which were the province of his Military Adviser. 4. The Coast Watching Schenoe was ready and a copy was being sent to me. 5. X mentioned a complaint I had received regarding a small waqf mosque belonging to the community of 'dyers' • The question was discussed in detail and His Highness said that if the complainant so wished, his proper course was to refer to the 1 Shar , a Court. ^ v 6. The general history and finances of the Hospital were discussed. Although the State always responded to requests for public subscriptions I thought that perhaps His Highness might prefer to make some more regular donation towards its upkeep, since a large number of his subjects benefited from it. His Highness said that he did not like to commit his Qovernment to any permanent arrangement as it might so happen that the State built a hospital of its own but he would consider the matter. 7. The question of taxation in Matrah with reference to my 'Personal 1 letter of the 16th December 1943 was discussed at length. His Highness said that taxes (a) to (g) as mentioned in my letter should in his opinion be municipal taxes and it would be left to the municipality to take any further action in the matter. Taxes (h) and (i) applied only in respect of State land and not on an Individual's own property, since they were in any case a form of rent for the land so utilised, they would be retained by the State. Land tax is not taken where any land is owned by foreigners, a system which corresponds to the English freehold and leasehold. These taxes are slightly less on Muscat subjects. There are no taxes on religious, educations^, and charitable buildings. The question of 'Harasa' tax was one for the municipal ity to decide and I agreed to take action to regularise the 'date tax' and 'fishing boat tax'.8. His Highness gave me a copy of his regulations governing the possession of immovable property by foreigners. We discussed it in detail and His Highness made the following c omments :- The expression M immovable property' in Section 2 refers to land but the same expression in Section 3 refers to an types of immovable properties. But in this section the emphasis is on the word 'purchase' and foreigners are not prohibited from acquiring such property on rent. Section 4 requires to be read with the Muscat Order-in-Council, 1939. His Highness also pointed out that although the Registration Department was of comparatively recent origin, yet it was reasonable to suppose that in all sales of immovable property that took place before it was established some form of document had been exchanged between the parties. / ^7 Copy forwarded under 'Personal* letter dated the 3rd January 1944 to H.H. the Sultan. r \ xy * No.c/Jl Political Maecat.

For some time, the following taxes have uoen levied on British suujects in the itfuscat State. 1 . pate Tax — an octroi tax of 5% gd valorem on dates and other produce brought into Muscat or Matrah foi sale• 2. Fishing Boat Tax — 8 to 30 dollars a year according to the size of the vessel. 2. In this connection, a reference is invited to the correspond- ence ending with India Office endorsement No.PiZ. 5976/1938, dated . Auguat 30th 1938. These two taxes are still being paid without complaint and are unobjectionable and it is therefore recommended that they be applied to British subjects officially under Article 15 of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, 1939. 3. There are also two other levies. Hs.S/— for digging a well and Ftt.2/8/- for digging an irrigation channel, if they are dug on State land. His Highness the Sultan maintains that these are not taxes but rent for the State land so used and are a part of the ^Beit al Mal f * as understood in the Muscat State. There seems no reason to differ from this view and if it is accepted, the question of the regularisation of these levies does not arise. Political Agent, Muscat.COMFIDEHTIAL* D.O . So.

These regulations were discussed in detail and His Highness made the following comments# which have been included in t he 'aide-memoire* to this conversation. *The expression ’Immovable property* in Section 2 reiers to land but the same expression in Section 3 refers to all types of immovable properties. But in this section the emphasis is on the word ’purchase* and foreigners are not prohibited from acquiring such property on rent. Section 4 requires to be read with the Muscat Order-in- Council, 1939. *His Highness said that he had no objection to foreigners purchasing erch other's properties and that if for instance any British firm wisned to expand there would be no objection to tneir acquiring of 1 ices, residences, etc. on rent from Muscat subjects or from the Muscat Govt. 'His Highness also pointed out that although the Registration Department was of comparatively recent origin, yet it was reasonable to suppose that in all sales of immovable property that took place before it was established some form for of document had been exchanged between the parties*• 3. X should now explain now this question arose. Borne time ago the American Mission in Matrah wished to purchase a piece of waste land adjoining the Mission for the purpose of erecting a segregation hospital. It was assumed at the time that this land belonged to the Hindu Mahajan Association but they, in my opinion, stupidly refused Thoms' offdr. The Hon’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.X.E., Political Resident in the lersian Gulf, Rimhi re2 » ► Subsequently, the Sultan gnTe this piece ef land to the Mission. A deputation of Hindus waited on me but they had to admit that their legal claim to ownership was not substantial and since the land was waste and required for charitabxe purposes 1 advised them to £ive in gracefully. They then expressed f/ears for the safety of their other property and since, about the same tix^e, a British subject, born in Muscat and returning home after twenty years with the Mavy, was not permitted to keep a harasti hut which he had bought in public auction, 1 approached the Sultan with the above result. 4. It is now for consideration whether action should bo ta^en to obtain some similar restrictions on the ownership of property by Muscat subjects in British controlled territories which 1 suppose would primarily mean British India* A guide might be found from the Kashmir State where I believe foreigners are not permitted actually to purchase property but I am notsmare of the full details. It would also appear necessary first to ascertain whether the Boat ter has any practical application, that is to say, whether Muscat subjects are in the habit of acquiring immovable property in places such as Karachi and Bombay. I only xnow of one case at the moment and would therefore be ^rateful for your opinion whether to move further in the matter or not. / V. ^' I hjfi/ ^eD, PSR30KAL.

Its full betaiia are as follows* 3 . For some time ^ast the Wall of Matrah ha4 been levying in all twelve taxes on foreigners resident in liatrah. Ten of them were on buildings and repairs and tne other two were on digging wells and irrigation channels in State land* Similar taxes were not being levied in Muscat and none of them had been regularised by you according to Treaty* I too it the matter with His Highness who has now decided that the 10 taxes on buildings and repairs should be municipal taxes and it will be left to ' ' the Matrah Municipality to tane any further action. Since British subjects are adequately represented on the Municipality this decision is satisfactory* 4* The two taxes on wells and irrigation channels appear really to amo mt to rent for the State Ja nd so used and are somewhat similar to the Bait al Mai which it was decided by your predecessor in 193? was also a form of rent and did not require your official sanction* I am however mentioning this point in an official letter which I am sending by this mail* recommending that two other taxes namely date tax and fishing boat tax be officially applied to British subjects* 5* His Highness also informs me that land tax is not taken when any land is actually owned by foreigners* a system which rather corresponds to our English free hold ^ and lease ho id* There are no taxes on religious 9 educational and charitable buildings* Political Agency* Muscat.

The legal position has changed somewhat since Mr. Beckett’s minuted of 4.11.37 ty the introduction of the Mew Treaty and is now governed by Articles 4,5,8 and 15 of this Treaty. So far as most favoured nation’s rights are concerned the position is governed by Art. 6 of the American Treaty and existing practice ao regards other foreigners. The French and Dutch Treaties are only of academic interest and in any case are not specific. It may however be noted here that the American Mission do not pay any of the taxes now under objection but it is convenient to consider them as exempt on charitable grounds. 15. In practice it is not clear where the proceeds of each tax go^s and in theory it is unnecessary to specify as British rights under Art. 15 of the Treaty are comprehen sive. It is therefore only necessary to indicate the nature and legality of each tax actually being levied. 16.
