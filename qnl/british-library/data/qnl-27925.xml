This makes one think that Ahwaz which they call 'Arabistan' is inside the Arab countries. The statement adds, “As there is no territory in Iran by the name of Ara^istan, and as Ahwaz is a town inside the territory of the well-known Khuzistan, the Iranian Embassy in Egypt hastens to correct this news.

Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Vol I., Part II. Conf. 9748, Nos. 101 and 303. British interests in Arabistan at the close of the last century. KHAZAL KHAN succeeded, at the age of 36, to the Sheikhdom of Mohammerah on the murder of his elder brother, Mizal Khan, on the 2nd June, 1897. At that time British policy in Persia was governed, as it has invariably been since, by inter-acting strategic and economic considerations. In the straapic field, the basic consideration was the defence of India, and this involved watching and countering Russian political and economic thrusts from the north; to this end the British Government pursued a policy of strengthening the weak buffer State while also endeavouring to build up a position in the south so as not to be caught at a disadvantage should that buffer State disintegrate. British defence schemes, based as they were on naval power, made the Persian Gulf a region of great strategic importance to India, and therefore to this country, and it was necessary to watch the activities not only of Russia but also of Germany and Turkey in that region. An essential part of British policy in the Gulf was the establish ment of good relations and the conclusion of treaties with the various Arab rulers, and the Sheikhs of Mohammerah, controlling territory at the head of the Gulf, thus came very prominently into the general scheme. In the economic field also, although the days of the d’Arcy concession and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had not yet arrived, British and Indian interests were considerable : Mohammerah was a port of call for British India Steam Navigation Company’s vessels, a British Indian post office had been established there, a British firm (Messrs. Lynch) controlled the only non-Persian navigation service on the River Karun (which had been opened to navigation in 1888) and British interests were concerned in various road and railway projects in Arabistan. 2. The Sheikhs of Mohammerah, who were chiefs of the Muhaism division of the the Chaab Arabs, were nominally Persian subjects, but they enjoyed in Arabistan a large measure of autonomy and semi-independence in the administra tion of their territories. The latter, which derived from hereditary occupation, extended beyond Ahwaz and generally covered almost the whole of southern Arabistan, while, in addition, the Sheikhs had large interests to the west of the Shatt-el-Arab in what was recognised as Turkish territory—including the allegiance of members of their own tribe engaged in cultivation there. The British Government had established friendly relations with Sheikh Jabir of of Mohammerah and had supported him after the Anglo-Persian war of 1857, and these relations were continued after the accession of his son Mizal Khan to the sheikhdom in 1881; later, however, owing to his annoyance at the competition of Messrs. Lynch with himself in the carrying trade on the Karun and at actions of the British Vice-Consul at Mohammerah in appealing to Persian authorities against his proceedings, and also owing to his fear of incurring the distrust of the Persian Government, Mizal’s relations with the British deteriorated. In 1895, when disaffection towards Mizal became rife among his own tribesmen, Khazal Khan, whose accession to the sheikhdom began to appear probable, assured the British Vice-Consul that his political salvation lay in assisting and not opposing the British and that if. as Sheikh, he should be called upon to choose a policy, it would be one of sincere friendship with the British Government, although political exigencies might dictate concealment of its real nature. Early British assurances to the Sheikh, 1899-1903. 3. On his accession, Sheikh Khazal, guided by his principal adviser, the shrewd and able Hadji Mohamed Ali Behbehani, Rais-et-Tujjar, pursued a policy of strengthening his rule both around Mohammerah and in other districts to which his family had traditional claims and of seeking to establish his position vis-a-vis of the Persian Government. The negotiations with the Central Govern ment at Tehran were in the hands of the Rais-et-Tujjar and the British Legation assisted with their advice. Eventually, in 1903, the Sheikh received firmans from the Shah which recognised as “perpetual properties’’ the lands of the Sheikh and his tribes at Mohammerah, Abadan Island, Bahmanshir, Karun, Hindyan, Dehmulla and Fallahiyeh; these firmans stipulated that the Sheikh should pay only the usual annual revenues to the Persian Government and that the latter should have no right to take possession of, or interfere with, the properties (or alternatively, if they should acquire them, should pay a reasonable price to the Sheikh); there was also a stipulation (which became important later m connexion with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession) that the proper ties must not be sold or transferred to foreigners, but there was no ban on their being leased.4. On his accession, Sheikh Khazal lost no time in again informing His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah of his friendship for the British Govern ment and of his desire to serve them, and in November, 1898, alarmed at the course of his discussions with the Persian Government, he expressed the wish to be taken secretly under British protection; he did not press for a written assurance, nor did he ask for an alliance against the Persian Government, whom he professed to have served faithfully and whom he would continue to serve, bij^he thought the British Government should not allow his influence to be diminished by the Persian Government. Later he informed the British Resident in the Persian Gulf that he apprehended an early downfall of the Persian monarchy, followed by a general scramble and partition of the kingdom, in which case he was anxious that his lot should be thrown in with the British Government. Acting on instructions from the British Minister at Tehran, the Political Resident informed the Sheikh in May, 1899, to the following effect:— We could not, of course, undertake to maintain the Sheikh against the Persian Government, nor could we say that, if the latter were to break up, we could guarantee his independence; the British Government did not con template such an contingency; but we regarded him as the most influential person in this part of the world and we intended as far as possible to support him, believing that it was in the interest of the country that he should be strong; if ever he wanted our advice we would give it; in return we expected that he would help us in matters of trade, &lt;&amp;c.; he could rely upon our goodwill at all times, and upon our help whenever we could give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government. 5. In 1902, as a result of expressed fears of Russia, the Sheikh pressed for additional and written assurances, and His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in the knowledge that a Russian consular officer was to be appointed in Arabistan (where Russian trade was non-existent), and in view' of the possibility that the Sheikh might turn to the Russians for support, urged that something should be done to instil into the Sheikh real confidence in the strength and resolution of His Majesty’s Government. In the result, Sir A. Hardinge addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 7th December, 1902 (the text of which is reproduced as document No. 1 in the annex), assuring him that we would protect Mohammerah against naval attack by any foreign Power (whatever might be alleged as pretext for such action) and. also, as long as he remained faithful to the Shah and acted according to our advice, we should continue to give him our good offices and support. Prior to the despatch of this letter, His Majesty’s Minister informed the Grand Vizier orally that he had no wish to call in question the Shah’s sovereignty over the Sheikh and his people, which His Majesty’s Govern ment had always recognised; but His Majesty’s Government were determined to support the Sheikh against attempts by Russian agents to intimidate him or to insinuate that they could bring pressure to bear on him owing to the influence which Russia exercised at Tehran. (His Majesty’s Government’s attitude in the matter was subsequently made clear in writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.) 6. In December, 1903, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran proceeded to the Persian Gulf to meet the Viceroy, and on his return journey was visited by Sheikh Khazal at Mohammerah. The Sheikh then complained that the Persian Government were not abiding by their undertakings given in the previous year, both as regards the administration of Customs at Mohammerah and the payment of Customs duties by himself, and that they were attempting gradually to pare away his authority and destroy the prestige on which it rested He contrasted the measure of support which he obtained from His Majesty’s Govern ment with that accorded by them to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein and asked whether His Majesty’s Government would now give him a definite promise of support in the event of the Persian Government’s repudiating the bargain they had made with him. In the course of this conversation the Sheikh mentioned that the Russians were quite prepared to give him promises of protection and Sir A Hardinge thought it not improbable that, if we withheld our support from him, he might enter into some secret arrangement with them After consulta tion with the Foreign Office and the Government of India, Sir A Hardine-e addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 24th December, 1903 stating that the latter might rest assured of the support of the British Government so Iona- as he, on his own side, observed the conditions of the arrangement made with°the Persian Government ; the text of this letter is reproduced as document No 2 in the annex. The reply of the Sheikh to this letter was given orally on his behalf [32557] ' „ a w Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Vol. I, pp. 1764, et seg. Conf. 10039. Conf. 8215, Nos. 222, 237 Ditto, No. 406.

Later in t le year, however, the Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the Sheikh was cha ng at the difficulties and uncertainty of his relations with, and position under, Jiie Shah’s Government, and was at heart dissatisfied at the limited measure at support which the British Government had been able to promise him. Renewals and Amplification of British Assurances, 1908-10. 7. In the years following the British assurances, Sheikh Khazal appears to have suffered little serious interference from the central Government, who, in their weakness and in the chaotic situation in the country generally, appeal to have been content to allow the Sheikh to rule undisturbed over his territories . in fact, the Sheikh actually complained to His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah in October, 1907, that, while the Persian press and the Majlis were attacking him on various counts, he was being left to his ow T n resources in policing the Shatt-el-Arab and suppressing disorders amongst the Persian tribes. He expressed a similar view to the British Resident in January, 1908, complaining that he was left to defend the frontier against Turkey, and had to meet heavy expenditure which should have been borne by the central Government; (actually, although Turkey was making trouble further north, she had not extended such activities to the Sheikh’s territories). 8. At the meeting with Major (afterwards Sir Percy) Cox in January, 1908, the Sheikh, influenced partly by recent assurances given to the Sheikh of Koweit (with whom he was on terms of close friendship) and by the advent of constitu tional government in Persia, raised again the question of the British assurances, saying that it was vital for him to know what would be the policy of His Majesty’s Government, as far as he was concerned, in the event of (a) the break-up of Persia, or (h) an attempt by the Majlis (as opposed to the former absolute govern ment of the Shah) “ to reduce him to nothing ”; he asked for an assurance in writing which should apply not only to himself but to his heirs, in return for which he offered to bind himself to the British Government in any way considered feasible. In reporting this conversation, the Political Resident expressed the opinion that the Sheikh was primarily sincere in his protestations that his hopes and interests were centred on the British Government, but that he was never theless mainly prompted by the dictates of self-preservation and that, failing satisfaction from us, he might turn to the Germans for support. The Foreign Office took the view that the Sheikh, by reason of the geographical situation of his possessions and by his considerable local influence, was in a position to hinder, or even prevent, the prosecution of any foreign enterprise in the country watered by the Karun, and that it was very desirable to secure his absolute adherence to British interests in order to ensure that his power might always be exercised in their favour by opposing any schemes which might be distasteful to His Majesty’s Government; they were, therefore, disposed to repeat the previous assurances, applying them to the Sheikh’s successor and amplifying them by a form of words which would include the continuance of the Sheikh’s existing state of autonomy. 9. After consultation with the Government of India, the Political Resident received instructions to address a written assurance to the Sheikh, which he did in a letter of the 1st December, 1908, the text of which is given as document No. 3 in the annex. 10. These renewed and amplified assurances failed to satisfy the Sheikh, who, in March, 1909, complained to the Political Resident that they safeguarded him only as long as Persia remained a sovereign State; he wished the guarantee to be extended in such a manner as to make it effective in the event of Persia’s being occupied by foreign Powers or ceasing to be an independent State as a result of foreign intervention; above all he wanted an assurance to the effect that, provided he and his heirs and tribesmen continued to show themselves amenable to British advice and faithful to British interests, their possessions would be guaranteed to them. In addition, he asked for advice whether to side with the Royalists or Nationalists, both of which parties had been calling upon him to throw in his lot with them, declaring that he must inevitably take one side or the other and expressing his fear that, if he came to a decision without our advice, we might withdraw our guarantee on the ground that his decision was unsatisfactory to us. Lastly, he appealed for a loan, saying that, if we coulddo nothing for him, we must not object to his applying elsewhere; (hints of the establishment of relations with other Powers, were, as has been seen, part of his- stock bargaining assets). 11. As regards the proposed loan, neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Government of India w r ere at first anxious themselves to make an advance to the Sheikh, who, however, showed his hand by obtaining a loan of £1,000 conf. 9540, from the German firm, Wonokhaus and Company. Details of the subsequent No 435 discissions need not here be given, but eventually it was arranged that His Majesty’s Government should advance a sum of £10,000, the amount actually Conf. 9552, being furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who, by an agreement signed No - 386 - with the Sheikh on the 16th July, 1909, secured the lease of valuable sites on Abadan island and elsewhere. It may be mentioned also that two months earlier Conf 9540, assurances had been obtained from the Sheikh regarding prior British rights in No - 7 irrigation projects on the Karun and other rivers in his territories. 12. The request of the Sheikh for advice as to the action he should take vis-a-vis of the Royalists and Nationalists was met by the recommendation not Conf. 9540, to involve himself in Persian party politics. As regards the Sheikh’s desire for No n - further assurances, the Political Resident had several conversations with the Sheikh, to whom he eventually addressed a letter on the 16th May, 1909 (the text of which is reproduced as document No. 4 in the Annex). The new assurances Conf. 9552, were in the following words :— No 291 “ I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia, the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now prepared to extend the application of those assurances to your ‘ heirs and successors.’ ” 13. The Sheikh was still not satisfied and in discussions with the Political Resident stated that he wished the assurances to be made applicable for a period ^ onf 18 9 ^ 33, of 100 years to his “ male descendants ” rather than to his “ heirs and successors.” 0 The reason for the request to extend the assurances to his male descendants was that he feared that his nephew Hanzal might seize some favourable opportunity to effect his own (Khazal’s) or his eldest son’s (Chassib’s) assassination and usurp the sheikhdom; and that for a stated period was that he feared that at some future date the British Government might find it necessary to intervene in Southern Persia and perhaps find it convenient to take over Mohammerah, when he might lose his privileges and revenues—In which case he would like an under taking that he would continue to enjoy his personal revenue and be granted an asylum in India or elsewhere. Finally, he asked for a form of written assurances which he could show to his tribesmen to quiet their apprehensions and to strengthen their support of himself and their faith in the friendly policy of the British Government. 14. There was considerable delay before fresh assurances were given to the Sheikh, who, for a number of reasons, was becoming anxious as to his position. In the first place he was concerned at the growing influence at Tehran of the Bakhtiari Minister of the Interior, Sardar Assad, who was hostile to himself, and Conf. 9738, early in 1910 Sheikh Khazal was speaking of intervention in Persian politics; he No 427# was, however, told that his best policy was to continue his allegiance to the Central Government, to whom he should submit any grievances, and that His Majesty’s Legation would support him if he were refused satisfaction. The Sheikh expressed his readiness to comply with this advice but wished in return for an assurance conf 9743, of protection against the Bakhtiari; this, however, His Majesty’s Government No. 241. considered both unnecessary and undesirable. 15. Later in the year matters were complicated by the action of the Vali of Basra, who, because of alleged actions of the Sheikh’s followers in Turkish territory and of the Sheikh’s refusal to surrender one of his tribal chiefs (of Persian nationality), sent a gun-boat which shelled one of the Sheikh’s villages conf. 9743, on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab. The Sheikh, who expressed his readi- No. 233. ness to raise his whole territory against the Turks, was, however, prepared to be guided by His Majesty’s Government in this matter, and the latter found themselves in a position of having to implement their assurances against attack from a foreign Power. While holding a warship in readiness to proceed to Mohammerah if necessary, they found it possible to safeguard the Sheikh’s position without resorting to hostilities; it was, however, deemed desirable to counteract a certain amount of loss of prestige suffered by the Sheikh and also to make a demonstration in face of the growth of Turkish ambitions in the6 Conf. 9878, No. 272. Conf. 9878, No. 416. Conf. 11794.* Persian Gulf area and, having satisfied themselves that the fault m the inei- dent had lain w2 tie Turk.sh 8 Vali and that Sheikh Khazal had^uentty acted correctly and in accordance with British advice, it was arranged tnat the Political Resident should proceed to Mohammerah in a warship, present the Sheikh with the insignia of the K.C.I.E., and ^rlrZent of In^a assurances on which His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India had agreed.^ of the insignia pi ace with due ceremony® the Sheikh’s palace at Failiyah on the 15th October, 1910. In his speech the Political Kesident referred to His Majesty’s Government s good-will and esteem and to their appreciation of the Sheikh’s sustained efforts to preserve order and security for trade in the districts under his control. In his reply the Sheikh spoke of the friendship between the Persian and British Governments and of his hopes that he might be able to render service and devotion to the foimei and to earn the approval of the latter. As regards the assurances the Political Resi dent addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 15th October the text of which is reproduced as document No. 5 in the Annex, and also another in identic terms (except for the omission of the words “ to be acceptable to your tribesmen ) which the Sheikh could show, if necessary, to the headmen of the tribes under his control. The written assurances were accompanied by an important oial statement by the Political Resident, in the presence of His Majesty s Consul at Mohammerah and the Rais-et-Tujjar, to the effect that the Sheikh must under stand that circumstances might arise m which it would be impossible tor Mis Majesty’s Government to intervene by force on his behalf. The Sheikh rep le that he quite understood this and that it was sufficient for him to know that His Majesty’s Government really meant to safeguard him to the best of their ability in case of emergency. Thus ended a long chapter, to which need be added only the fact that in the following December the Persian Minister tor Foreign Affairs spoke to His Majesty’s Minister on the subject of the Sheikh, saying that information had been received that the latter was under British protection; to this Sir G. Barclay replied that the Sheikh was not a Britisn protected person but that His Majesty’s Government had special relations with him, and that, in the event of any encroachment on his rights, he would receive their support; the text of the assurances were not, however, communicated to the Persian Government. The Assurances of 1914- 17. In December, 1913 (at a time when His Majesty’s Government were contemplating the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), the Sheikh asked Sir Percy Cox for further assurances on the following lines :— (a) that we should make the position regarding the succession more secure by a modification of the existing assurances; (b) that we would take cognisance of a definite peace compact between the Sheikh and the Bakhtians which would render him immune from the necessity and expense of protecting his territory against their aggression; and • i i. (c) that we should endeavour to devise and take measures with the Persian Government to secure to him the status of local autonomy to which the history of the past entitled him and which he was then enjoying in practice, although on a precarious basis. These matters were still under discussion by His Majesty’s Government when the outbreak of war in 1914 transformed the situation; the disintegration of Persia and the encroachment of Russia, which had previously been the mam pre occupation of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, were eclipsed by the more immediate menace from Germany and Turkey, and it was regarded as clearly essential that we should reaffirm and strengthen our assurances to the Sheikh, who, there was reason to believe, was ready to act in collusion with the Sheikh of Koweit, with Ibn Saud and with certain notables of Basra, in preparing the way for a peaceful British occupation of that port. The Government of India now recommended that the former assurances should be reaffirmed and strengthened and that, in addition, we should undertake to maintain the Sheikh in secure and untaxed possession of his date gardens on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab. 18. On the 3rd November, 1914 (i.e., before the formal announcement by His Majesty’s Government on the 5th November that a state of war existed with Turkev but at a time when hostilities had actually commenced), Colonel Knox,(zc the acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, addressed a letter to the Sheikh containing the revised assurances. The text of this letter need not be reproduced here because it mentioned the co-operation to be expected from the Sheikh in the capture of Basra, and, as the question of such co-operation did not actually the Sheikh, after the capture of Basra, asked for a revised letter from which the passages relating thereto should be omitted. Sir P. Cox therefore addressed to himji new letter bearing the date the 22nd November, 1914 (i.e., that on which BasVF was occupied by British forces), which became the master document, the text of which is reproduced as document No. 6 in the annex. The War Period. 19. It may be recorded briefly that the Sheikh was of positive assistance to His Majesty’s Government during the war, largely by his maintenance of order m that part of Persia where British interests were so considerable. This was particu larly the case in 1915 when certain unruly tribes under his jurisdiction, incited by the preaching of a jehad by Turkish agents, rose in revolt and assisted the Turks conf. 1.3055.* in an attack on British troops at Ahwaz and in cutting the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s pipe line; on that occasion the Sheikh did much to facilitate the rapid restitution of order as soon as the Turks had been driven back. Towards the end of 1915, when it appeared probable for a time that Persia would intervene m the war on the side of the enemy, there was some discussion of recognising the Sheikh’s independence in that event, but, as the emergency never in fact occurred, Conf. 11794/ Sir P. Cox’s letter of the 22nd November, 1914, remained the final embodiment of His Majesty’s Government’s commitments to the Sheikh. The Post-War Period, 1919-20. 20. The end of hostilities in Europe and in the Ottoman Empire brought little improvement in the state of Persia, which continued to exercise His Majesty s Government. The danger from Germany and Turkey was now removed but that from Russia was revived in a new form—Bolshevism. The Sheikh’s territories, by contrast, remained generally quiet, to the benefit of British interests which had grown enormously. Although order was maintained in the Sheikh s territories, this was achieved only by autocratic and oppressive rule and the Sheikh was no longer a popular ruler. He maintained his control of the tribes by a policy of Goaf. 13055,* breaking the power of any sheikh or tribe likely to become too strong and a danger p 222 - to his rule, replacing the suspected leaders by agents of his own selection who governed the tribes and collected revenue from them; in the process, incidentally, he acquired personal possession of much property. He now feared for his life, Ditto, p. 220. and Chassib Khan, his eldest son, whom he had appointed as Governor of Mohammerah in 1919, came under suspicion, as a result of which he was removed from his post in 1921 and thenceforward carefully watched. Khazal continued to enjoy the support of His Majesty’s Government, who, however, had not, in his opinion, sufficiently rewarded him for his past services. (In particular, he was disappointed that Feisal ibn Hussein had been chosen as King of Iraq rather than himself.) The rise of Reza Khan. 21. The beginning of the decline of the Sheikh’s power coincided with, and was a direct result of, the rise of Reza Khan, who was ultimately personally responsible for the Sheikh’s complete downfall. General Reza Khan arrived at Tehran with his force of Cossacks in February, 1921, took control of the capital and from that time, until he became Prime Minister himself in October, 1923, was, as Minister of War, the main force in Persian politics His immediate policy was to bring the country under the control of the Central Government, and for this purpose he organised military formations in the distant parts which had hitherto been largely outside the control of the Government; at first, however, he found it politic to leave the Sheikh’s territories alone. Financial dispute between the Sheikh and the Persian Government. 22. Prior to the advent of Reza Khan, the Central Government had been showing resentment at the prosperity of Arabistan from which they were deriving no direct financial benefit owing to {a) the non-payment by the Sheikh of his annual revenue {maliyat), and (b) the appropriation to himself by the Sheikh of all indirect taxation. It is unnecessary here to enter into details of the8 Conf. 12004, No. 175. E 2003/2003/ 34/1922. E3121/6/34/ 1922. E4348/6/34/ 1922. E4931/6/34/ 1922. E5194/6/34/ 1922. E5379/6/34/ 1922.

E7260/6/34/ 1922. sarly negotiations between the Sheikh and the Central Government, but the position at the end of 1921 was briefly as follows : The Sheikh had paid no maliyat since 1913 but on the other hand was claiming from the Persian Government sums which he had expen . g the war in maintaining law and order in Arabistan without any assistance from the Persian Government. After prolonged negotiations in which His Maiestv’s Legation at Tehran had lent support to the Sheikh. Vo ^£g h - ed-Dowleh had agreed to waive the payment of mahyat ior the war y Tiod and to accept a moiety for six years as from 1920. Lnfortunately, matters were not put on a formal basis and the Sheikh was not fuby satisfied and refused to continue payment. Qawam-es-Sultaneh stated that neither is Government nor the Majlis would accept the settlement to which Vossugh-ed- Dowleh had agreed, but had offered* to waive the war-time revenues in exdhange for the payment in full as from 1920. To this, however the Sheikh would not agree unless arrangements were made by which the Persian Government would meet part of the recurring expenditure in maintaining law and order in Southern Arabistan, and when, early in 1922, proposals to this effect were advanced, he would accept no compromise in spite of advice from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, who regarded the proposed terms as reasonable. 23. Matters took a new turn in April, 1922, when it was learned that the Persian Government proposed to send troops into Arabistan to compel the Sheikh to pay his revenue. The Sheikh now asked for British intervention, appealing to the assurances given to him and declaring that the despatch of a small force to Arabistan would lead to unrest and anarchy, with consequent loss to British commercial interests. On learning of this, Sir P. Loraine requested the Political Resident to see the Sheikh and speak to him seriously : the Sheikh had only himself to blame, and while the British obligations to him were fully recognised, they were clearly not intended to protect him from discharging his obligations to the Persian Government; the undesirability of the despatch of Persian troops to Arabistan from the British point was also fully realised, but the Minister of War (who was responsible) was an opponent of the Bolsheviks and might therefore prove an asset to His Majesty’s Government, and Sir P. Loraine did not wish to take up a bad case with him; the first essential was, therefore, that the Sheikh should come to a reasonable settlement with the Persian Government. The Political Resident, being unable himself to see the Sheikh, instructed His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz to impress upon the Sheikh that, if he desired British support in accordance with the 1914 assurances, he must fulfil his obligations to the Persian Government, among the first of whidh was the payment of revenue. This produced what appeared to be a satisfactory settlement, the Sheikh promising to pay two years’ arrears of revenue on being released from payments during the war. The matter was not, however, finally settled as the actual amount of the arrears had not been fixed, but early in June Sir P. Loraine thought that the matter could be settled without his intervention and did not think that the despatch of troops to Arabistan was likely to materialise. The despatch of Persian troops to Arabistan, 1922. 24. On the 18th July, 1922, Sir P. Loraine received information that the Persian Government had despatched a force of 500 men for Arabistan and at once caused representations to be made to the Minister of War and Prime Minister, calling attention to the possible resultant dangers to British interests. The Prime Minister said that on grounds of prestige he could not recall the troops (which were merely to form a bodyguard for the Governor at Shushtar) but expressed his and Reza Khan’s readiness to give formal assurances to the Sheikh that the troops would not interfere with the Sheikh’s territory or the Arab tribes. On the same day Sir P. Loraine sent for two leading Bakhtiari Khans, explaining the situation and the action taken; it was agreed that the interests of the Bakhtiari, the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government were identical in this matter and that the Bakhtiaris and the Sheikh should support the representations of His Majesty’s Legation; the Khans proposed force, but Sir P. Loraine said that this must be absolutely the last resort and ought not to be necessary. The Foreign Office were somewhat disturbed by the report of this interview and made it clear to Sir P. Loraine that His Majesty’s Government must not be committed to embarrassing obligations towards the Bakhtiaris; Sir P. Loraine was instructed to employ all his efforts to induce the Persian Government to abandon any inten tion as regards Southern Arabistan. but was informed that there seemed to belittle reason to object to the “bodyguard” proposal outside the Sheikh &amp; territories. Matters appeared to be fairly satisfactory when the Prime Minister assured Sir P. Loraine on the 24th July that neither the Sheikh nor his interests nor those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would be interfered with or threatened in the slightest degree by the presence of this bodyguard, bu Sir P. Loraine placed little faith in these protestations and suggested that t e Sheikh should endeavour to secure them in writing. Meanwhile, he was enAtevouring to facilitate, so far as he could with discretion, the settlement ot the Sheikh’s accounts with the Persian Government. 25. The Persian detachment proceeding from Isfahan was attacked anc. routed by the Kuhgilu tribe at Shalil in Bakhtiari country and the remnant forced to return to Isfahan. The Persian Government suspected that the Bakhtiari and the Sheikh of Mohammerah were responsible and it was stated m Tehran that His Majesty’s Government were deliberated encouraging the Sheikh of Mohammerah and other southern chiefs to flout the Central Government with the premeditated design of partitioning the country. Reza Khan, however, decided to bide his time, and in a conversation w T ith Sir P. Loraine at the end of August gave a definite assurance that no action of his would endanger the Anglo- Persian Oil Company’s interests; during this conversation Sir P. Loraine made it plain that, while we had certain friendships with local chiefs, we had never used them against the Central Government or otherwise than in the interests of order and tranquillity. 26. Sir P. Loraine, in a despatch of the 4th September, 1922, examined the whole question of our relations with the Sheikh in the light of existing circum stances in Persia. The Persian Government now’ possessed an army with power (always assuming the continued existence of Reza Khan) to break down resistance in the outlying districts, and Sir P. Loraine’s view was that it would be preferable to deal with a strong central authority (provided we were reasonably satisfied as regards its chances of stability) rather than with a number of local rulers; this would involve a loosening of our relations with such local rulers; in his opinion. His Majesty’s Government should proceed very carefully for the time being and be as strictly non-partisan as possible; we must not abandon existing friendships but must attempt the delicate task of preparing the ground so as not to fall between two stools in the event of a radical change in the Persian situation. On the following day Sir P. Loraine sent a message to the Sheikh saying that he was satisfied Reza Khan would not take violent action and that he had promised to do nothing to endanger the common interests of Persia and Great Britain, that he (Sir P. Loraine) trusted the Sheikh to remove any grounds for suspicion against himself, and that he believed that there was a sound possibility of a good under standing between the Sheikh and the Minister of War. whom Sir P. Loraine had found trustworthy in his dealings. Lord Curzon informed Sir P. Loraine on the 12th October that he concurred entirely in the general lines of the proposed policy towards the Sheikh and that it could be pursued in reliance upon his (Lord Curzon’s) support. And the Sheikh sent a reply to Sir P. Loraine expressing his thanks for the latter’s friendly support and promising to use his best endeavours to achieve the ends for which he was advised to work. With the removal of Zahir-ul-Mulk (Moayyed-ed-Dowldh), who had consistently opposed the Sheikh, and the appointment in his place as Governor of Arabistan of Mushar-ed-Dowleh, with whom the Sheikh established good relations, and with Reza Khan’s expressions of friendly sentiments towards the Sheikh, the eventful year 1922 closed, as far as the latter’s affairs were concerned, on a peaceful note; but the financial question had not yet been definitely settled and Reza Khan was not the man to forget a rebuff or to abandon his schemes for using the army to effect the centralisation of Government control over the whole of Persia and the Sheikh had little faith in the promises of Reza Khan.

The year 1923 was notable in the Sheikh’s affairs for the extension of the central Government’s influence in the Bakhtiari country, for the apparent settle ment of the Sheikh’s financial dispute and for the measures taken by His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran to bring about good relations between him and Reza Khan and to attempt to dissuade the latter from embarking upon a course of action which would adversely affect British interests in Arabistan. 28. Details of the measures by which Reza Khan broke the power and pres tige of the Bakhtiaris fall outside the scope of this memorandum, but the fact that this was done had an important bearing on the position of the Sheikh of Moham merah as it marked the crumbling of the barrier which had been for so long [32557] c- ■Mm Persian Gulf Annual Report for 1923, p. 57 (Persia, No. 35).

The Sheikh was thus allowel to continue to control indirect revenue, but a financial agent of the Central Government was to remain as inspecting officer for the whole province of Arabistan. 30. In April, 1923, when the Persian Government were P re P&amp; ri ng to send a military force against the Bakhtiaris, Sir P. Lorame spoke to the Shah, the Pn e Minister the Foreign Minister and Reza Khan on the dangers of provoking the tribes in the south, with possibly harmful effects on both British and I ersian interests The Minister of War was not to be moved from his purpose, however, and 1 Sir P. Loraine reported at the end of the month that there were further indications to confirm that Arabistan was the ulterior objective m wl } lc b case Reza Khan would doubtless pursue the same tactics with the Sheikh ashe had with the Bakhtiaris; the question of our assurances to the Sheikh would then arise. A few days later Sir P. Loraine telegraphed saying that an immediate decision was required whether we were to support or oppose the extension of the authority of the Central Government throughout the entire country, and, in either case, by what means; to support the Minister of War would mean the almost certain lapse of our local friendships (of which the most important and difficult case was that of the Sheikh of Mohammerah), but by giving such support we might obtain a measure of control over Reza Khan and perhaps some definite assurances as regards the Sheikh’s position; on the other hand, to oppose him meant the pros pect of the same local friendships crumbling under visible force, the gradual collapse of our position and influence unless we were prepared to use force, the thwarting of the one chance that had appeared for decades of a stable Persia under Persian control, a period of intense friction with the Persian Government almost certainly leading to a rupture, and, finally playing into the hands ot Russia. Lord Curzon, however, was not to be rushed into formulating a new policy at this juncture and replied to Sir P. Loraine calling attention to what His Majesty’s Government had done to help the Persian Government and to the apparent inability of Reza Khan to appreciate our attitude in his pursuance of an ambition to create a military dictatorship for himself ; as regards the Sheikh we were bound to him by special obligations which we had no intention to ignore; Reza Khan must be made to realise that he could not prosecute his centralising policy to a point where it ran directly counter to British interests ; in the last resort he was dependent upon His Majesty’s Government—who were alone able to afford him that financial support which he required. The Foreign Office also arranged with the Admiralty to hold some of His Majesty s ships in readiness to proceed to Mohammerah and also up the Karun should it prove necessary to support May g ir p Loraine had a meeting with the Prime Minister and Reza Khan, who, after expressing a wish for the general improvement of Anglo-Persian relations and repeating assurances as regards British interests, said that far from having any complaints against the Sheikh, they wished and meant to support him; for internal reasons they wished to send 200 men to Shushtar; Reza Khan said that the presence of some troops in Arabistan was vital to his prestige and that if His Majesty’s Government were to veto the pro posal he would have to resign; he gave his word of honour—and promised written assurances that the troops would not interfere with the Sheikh, but that their orders would be to support him against any who might question his authority; the Prime Minister also promised to telegraph to the Sheikh saying that the Persian Government had no grievances against him and were entirely well disposed; Sir P. Loraine (who took the view that acquiescence in the despatch11 xad illy aed *ar, the at in t ty’s ,tle- vvas the &gt;aid ion, di’s e to ,s to id a ame the sian jver, ther case with rise, ision irity e, by apse that dn a ;s as pros- tdual i, the ersia ment Is of new t His i the ce of aeikh mre; ising 3 last ; able 3 also liness iry to nister jnt of 3 rests, d and en to a was 3 pro- ritten their ority; it the well ipatch of the troops, if accompanied by adequate assurances. was ,‘ff, • ' Govern- opposition) also requested the Prime Minister to confirm on behalf of his bovern ment the special position of the Sheikh as granted by his while agreeing that the general result of this interview 7*?, at £ f ^’ that Reza Khan’s written undertaking to the Sheikh should be wu si ® ilar by the Prime Minister, or, alternatively, that the latter should sign a simiia dijgjment.The gheikh h|mself] on being informed of the prop^als was far from haonv saying that he put no faith in Persian promises, oral or written and thathe would withdraw his objections only if the written assurance of Reza Khan were baS by a written guarantee from His Majesty’s Minister tha the number (^Persian troops would he limited to 200 and not increased after their arrival and that they would not interfere with his recognised rights and jurisdiction.

Loraine stating that these troops had been sent with the principal object of maintaining ^ and that the local tribes would be supported so long as they fulfilled their duties and obligations to the central Government. The letter went on to say . “Especially in connexion with the loyal services of his Excellency Serdar Akdass (Sheikh of Mohammerah) and the appreciation of the Ministry of War which his Excellency will, no doubt, win for himself m the course of his services, with the result that his Excellency may have complete faith and confidence in the friendly attitude and justice of the Government. In order to leave his Excellency no grounds for anxiety, the first instructions given to the officer commanding the departing troops were to be on his guard to prevent people who have local quarrels with his Excellency from abusing the arrival of the troops and turning it to their own evil advantage. On the same day, the Persian Prime Minister addressed a telegram to the Sheikh in the following terms “Although your Excellency’s services have always attracted attention of Government which has full confidence in you, nevertheless now m order that you may be aware of intentions of Government I hereby declare that Council of Ministers appreciate always your Excellency s services As long as vour Excellency endeavours to render services to Government latter will have full confidence in you and will never forget your Excellency s services. The only comment in the Foreign Office on learning of these two messages was that they were both capable of various interpretations but that they were better^than^iK^hing^^g ^ sought to e ff ect a genuine rapprochement between Reza Khan and the Sheikh and to endeavour to allay the latter’s fears. He decided to visit the Sheikh and before his departure spoke to Reza Khan, who said that His Majesty’s Minister could give the Sheikh the most positive assurances of his friendship and regard and of his anxiety to establish a personal understanding with him. 35 Sir P. Loraine visited Ahwaz on the 13th October and had a conversa tion with the Sheikh, who expressed his anxieties as to his future position and begged that he should not be lulled into a false sense of security only to be struck down when all the obstacles to the Persian unifying policy had been removed; he could not remain in Arabistan with his prestige diminished and his authority undermined, and would sooner lease or sell his properties and retire to some part of the world where he could be under British protection. Sir P. Lorame, m reply, analysed current British policy in Persia, according to which it was [32557] c ‘ 2 E 6019/1416/ 34/1923. E 6156/1416/ 34/1923. E11560/1416/ 34/1923. E10269/1416/ 34/1923.

The Sheikh said that he could put no faith in Persian promises, where upon Sir P. Loraine asked him bluntly whether he expected the British Govern ment to go to war with Persia in order to maintain the Sheikh in his pos^. on of semi-independence. The Sheikh protested that he did not wish to be a source of embarrassment to the British Government, but felt compelled to voice his fears; he would loyally carry out any instructions which His Majesty’s Minister might give him, and if he found his authority being undermined he would inform Sir P. Loraine and rely upon him to find a solution. Sir P. Loraine replied that he would at all times do his best to protect the Sheikh and that the continuance of the latter’s existing friendly relations with the Persian Government and especially with Reza Khan provided the best guarantee of his ability to ensure that protection. 36. At a later interview on the 16th October, the Sheikh showed his readiness to throw in his lot with Reza Khan, having had a satisfactory interview the previous day with Colonel Baqir Khan, the Persian commander at Shushtar. The Sheikh was anxious to have a personal interview with Reza Khan and suggested that he should offer the latter two armoured cars. On his return to Tehran Sir P. Loraine gave Reza Khan on the 22nd October a brief account of what had passed. Reza Khan expressed his readiness to meet the Sheikh and promised to arrange this as soon as possible; he accepted the gift of armoured cars not for himself personally but on behalf of the army and the nation; and he promised to look after the Sheikh’s second son on his arrival at Tehran as a Deputy in the Majlis. The satisfactory settlement of the revenue dispute followed in mid-November and early in December Sir P. Loraine reported that, acting on his advice, the Sheikh had adjusted the agreement to suit the wishes of Reza Khan in regard to the non-deduction by the Sheikh of amounts spent on maintaining armed forces under his own control. The year thus closed with matters about as satisfactory as they could be, given the circumstances, but the Foreign Office had grave doubts whether the existing good relations between the Sheikh and Reza Khan (who had assumed the Premiership at the end of October) could long continue. The Rebellion of the Sheikh, 1924. 37. No major dispute arose between the Sheikh and the Central Govern ment during the first half of 1924, during which Reza Khan seems to have resorted to a policy of infiltration into the Sheikh’s territories. Thus, the Persian Govern ment announced their intention of sending a Karguzar to Abadan, who was also to act as Deputy Governor; the Adliyeh at Shushtar began to summon Arabs living in the Sheikh’s territories to attend the Court; a salt monopoly was given to an Iraqi subject without the Sheikh’s being consulted ; contrary to the arrange ments regarding indirect taxes, a Rais-al-Baladiyeh was appointed for Abadan; steps were taken to assess the value of the Sheikh’s date gardens with a view to further taxation; heads of Persian departments in Ahwaz, at the instigation, it was believed, of the Russian Consul, met constantly and abused the Sheikh and the Persian commander, Arab is tan (now re-named Khuzistan), did his best to foment trouble among the Arab tribes. But at the beginning of the year Reza Khan had other and more important matters in hand. Shortly after the Minister of War had assumed the premiership, the Shah, feeling himself powerless to resist the encroaching influence of his Prime Minister and fearing for his own personal safety, decided to visit Europe and keep out of the way. His absence added strength to the Republican movement, with which Reza Khan’s name became associated, but the movement collapsed at the end of March and Reza Khan’s prestige and influence reached their lowest level; he resigned early in April but quickly resumed the premiership on being invited by the Majlis to return. It is also worth recording, because it was a matter of concern to Sheikh Khazal. that there had been considerable changes in British official personnel with whom he had had dealings in the past: Sir P. Loraine was absent on leave from Tehran and Mr. Ovey was in charge of the Legation between the 28th March and the 15th November; Sir P. Cox, who had had so many dealings with the Sheikh and who, as High Commissioner at Bagdad, had not been so far removed geographically, had retired in 1923; and Colonel Trevor, the Political Resident who had served continuously in the Persian Gulf since 1912, left Bushire in April 1924. At a farewell interview with the Sheikh early in March, Colonel Trevor s13 found him in a depressed state of mind. The Sheikh spoke of his past services to His Majesty’s Government and of how he had followed their advice in meeting the wishes of the Persian Government; he was, however, convinced of the latter’s hostile intentions towards himself, and attributed this primarily to his friendship with the British Government. He wished to know whether the latter would preserve him in his autonomous position, and also, if the Persian Government ma^a direct attack on him, whether he should resist or submit. Colonel Trevor t&amp;j®ssed his inability to answer the first question on his own authority, and as regards the latter, said that he could hardly advise the Sheikh to resist his own Government. In reporting this conversation Colonel Trevor expressed his own firm conviction that Reza Khan was desirous of reducing the power of the Sheikh and raised the question of the 1914 assurances, pointing out that if we were to stand by and watch the Persian Government take progressive steps to reduce the Sheikh’s state of local autonomv, such an attitude would have a deplorable effect locally, and the Sheikh, not without some reason on his side, would think himself badly let down. Mr. Ovey’s comment on this report was to the effect that the Persian Government had done nothing which was not in accordance with the assurances given in the present year and that there did not appear to be any special grounds for the Sheikh’s nervousness; and the view expressed in the Foreign Office was that it was easy to understand the latter’s attitude, but that there was no reason to suppose that His Majesty’s Government would not continue to afford him adequate support by diplomatic means provided he paid his revenues and gave the Persian Government no valid excuse for interference in his territory. 38. A crisis arose early in August, partly due to the hostile attitude of Colonel Baqir Khan (the Persian Commander at Shushtar), but principally to the action of the Persian Government (inspired by their American financial advisers) in informing the Sheikh that his firmans were invalid, having been cancelled by a later firman of 1903. The Sheikh now expressed his determination to resist any further interference, if necessary by force, and commenced taking steps to secure the allegiance of his tribes. Mr. Ovey instructed His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz to inform the Sheikh {a) that he realised the latter’s anxiety, but that he could not believe that the Persian Government could legally proceed to the lengths feared; (&amp;) that he would call the Prime Minister’s attention to the grave issues involved and hoped to prevent any precipitate action; and (c) that if, instead of awaiting the results of the support of His Majesty’s Government, the Sheikh were to commit any rebellious act, he would be putting himself in the wrong and would prejudice his case with His Majesty’s Govern ment, who remained always willing fully to support his just claims.' Mr. Ovey added that if the Sheikh thought that the Prime Minister’s position had been shaken by recent political developments he was much mistaken and instructed the Acting Consul to use every argument to keep the Sheikh quiet. On the 23rd August the Foreign Office telegraphed to Mr. Ovey informing him of reports received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that the Sheikh was forming an alliance with the Bakhtiari, Kashgai, &amp;c., and was speaking of inviting the Shah to return to Mohammerah. Mr. Ovey was instructed (a) to have a further message sent to the Sheikh to the effect that, while he might rest assured that, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, Mr. Ovey was doing his utmost to induce the Persian Government to accord just consideration to the Sheikh’s recognised rights and interests, he must be reminded that the British assurances were dependent upon his loyalty to the central Government and that he should ^ 7 ^ am / r 2 I1 ^,? i y . vl ^ olent act101 } which would be highly prejudicial both to his and British interests; and (h) to inform the Persian Prime Minister that his recent administrative measures in South-West Persia appeared to be inconsistent with repeated assurances ,iven to His Majesty's Government and threatened vital British interests m those regions where they could not view u^ed n te 0 rhs r ti- d T ° PmentS - Wlth mdlfference ; Reza Khan should therefore be urged to abstain from pressing matters to an issue. Mr. Ovey took active steos and in the result the Prime Minister sent a message to the Sheikh saying that there was no intention of dispossessing him but that his attention was drawn the fact that he must not sell land to foreigners, and assuring him of suonort m every way as long as he continued to be loyal. The Sheikh w^ not vet sit,Td especially as Reza Khan subsequently sent him a bombastic and tactless telegram’ hhf rW con Y er y t,on Wlt h His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (Colonel Peel) expressed his determination to overthrow Reza Khan or perish in iC aiVZL P - t timl'iv! th i s . tru S? le was inevitable and there was more chance of success at'that E4642/263/ 34/1924 E8892/263/ 34/1924.

In addition, the Sheikh required a guarantee iiom His Majesty’s Government against unfriendly acts by Reza Khan in the future, and asked whether they would sell him arms and ammunition secretly. Cornel Peel added that he anticipated no danger to the pipe-line and that the SEVikh was unlikely to make any move against Persian troops unless he were attacked or reinforcements were sent towards Bebehan. . 39. On September 13th Mr. Ovey was requested to instruct the^ Political Resident to proceed to Mohammerah and hold language to the Sheikh in accordance with the Foreign Office instructions of the 23rd August, and he was also told to convey a message to the Prime Minister (then in Luristan) warning him of the great danger to which he might be exposing South-West Persia. These instructions were followed by others on the 17th September authorising Mr. Ovey to negotiate with Reza Khan with a view to the acceptance of the Sheikh’s conditions (i) and (iv) and as regards (ii) of a compromise that troops should not be reinforced as long as the Sheikh undertook to behave properly. In addi tion, a further message was to be sent to the Sheikh explaining what was being attempted on his behalf, but stating that His Majesty’s Government could not condone his warlike attitude or assist him in any way to defy the Persian Govern ment, and that, unless he abandoned his warlike attitude, they could not hold themselves responsible for the consequences. In the meantime, the Political Resident had interviewed the Sheikh, his second son (Abdul Hamid), the Bakhtiari Amir Mujahid and Colonel Riza Quli Khan (who had replaced Colonel Baqir Khan at Shushtar but who had apparently thrown in his lot with the Sheikh); all declared that no peace with Reza Khan was possible; the Sheikh had telegraphed to the Majlis explaining that his opposition was to Reza Khan personally and that it was hoped to persuade the Shah to return. On September 16th the Sheikh had also addressed a telegram to the foreign legations in Tehran in the nature of a proclamation against the Prime Minister, who was described as “a usurper and a transgressor of the Persian nation.” The Foreign Office therefore felt it necessary to inform Mr. Ovey that His Majesty's Government had no wish to avoid the guarantees to the Sheikh so long as he should maintain an attitude on which they were conditional, but that he would not be justified in looking to them for support were he to kindle a war and suffer defeat. The Foreign Office felt that it was essential that the atti tude of His Majesty’s Government should be clearly understood by the Sheikh, who might be led mto the belief by other British contacts (e.g., local repre sentatives of the oil company) that he would have the sympathy of the British Government in his struggle. 40. Reza Khan, from whatever motive, reacted favourably to Mr. Ovey's representations and practically placed himself in the hands of His Majesty ’5 Government; he undertook to refrain from asking the Majlis to proclaim the Sheikh a rebel and to approve warlike operations; he further undertook to confirm the Sheikh’s firmans, to recapitulate all his previous assurances to the Sheikh, and to guarantee the lives and properties of the Sheikh and his family and also Amir Mujahid. In return, Reza Khan said he must insist on Amir Mujahid’s exile and the Sheikh’s absence from Persia for three months, during which time he would definitely undertake to refrain from any military action or threats; he would also guarantee the Sheikh’s return, provided the latter made a suitable declaration of submission. All these undertakings were neces sarily contingent upon His Majesty’s Government succeeding in restoring the status quo ante in Khuzistan. 41. The Foreign Office considered that Reza Khan was acting with moderation and their only criticism of his attitude was that the proposed insistence on the Sheikh’s temporary departure from Persia might bring about a state of civil war. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald directed that our policy should be to hold ourselves impartial and enjoin peace, adding that we should, of course, lean to the regular authority and impress both sides accordingly. He informed Mr. Ovey on the 22nd September that he, like Lord Curzon, had never opposed Reza Khan’s policy of consolidating power in the hands of the Central Govern ment. as the one wish of His Majesty’s Government was to see a strong and unified Persia; he hoped, however, that Mr. Ovey would be able to persuade Reza Khan to abstain from insisting upon what amounted to the temporary banishment of the Sheikh and instructed him to persuade the latter to abstain from mobilising his forces. The Sheikh, who expressed his confidence in the15 result of a struggle with Keza Khan, proved difficult, and in an interview with Colonel Feel on tne 30th September, said that if his conditions were not accepted he would regard the British Government as having betrayed him. Further ehorts were made by Mr. Ovey to persuade the Sheikh to adopt a reasonable attitude and these were reinforced in a personal message which Mr. Ramsay MacDonald sent to the Sheikh in the middle of October. This message made it clear that His Majesty’s Government abided fully by the undertakings given to the Sheikh ■*ki #e past, but that such undertakings were conditional upon the Sheikh's observing his loyal obligations towards the Persian Government and that, in the regrettable event of hostilities, the Sheikh could expect no sympathy from His Majesty’s Government; Mr. Ramsay MacDonald expressed his confidence that an honourable settlement could be reached through the mediation of His Majesty's Government, and urged the Sheikh to desist from all military prepara tions and make his peace with the Central Government. 42. The Sheikh’s replv was to the following effect: he desired that His Majesty's Government should procure for him an honourable settlement, but he could not accept the terms offered by His Majesty’s Legation because he would lose his position in his territories and could no longer maintain peace there, so that his friendship towards the British Government would be worthless to them; the British were holding him back but meanwhile Reza Khan was proceeding with his military preparations; he felt that he had already lost the support of the British Government and suggested that he should either retire from Khuzistan with his whole family (being granted a residence and means of subsistence) or else that he be freed from restraint and allowed to fight Reza Khan, which he felt confident of doing with success; in the latter case, he was equally confident of his ability to protect British lives and property. The best hope of a peaceful settlement now appeared to lie in arranging a meeting between Reza Khan and the Sheikh, and, acting on instructions, Mr. Ovey approached both with the suggestion that they should meet at some place other than Tehran and that Sir P. Loraine should be present at the interview. After persuasion Reza Khan agreed but stipulated that the Sheikh must first send some message of submission and Mr. Ovey then sent a message urging the Sheikh to comply and giving a personal assurance that such a message would be followed by an immediate cessation of military preparations on the part of the Central Govern ment. Matters were also helped on by the abandonment bv Reza Khan of his demand that the Sheikh should temporarily leave Persia, but the Sheikh still made difficulties and it became clear that little could be done except play for time until Sir P. Loraine arrived in Persia and exercised his personal influence on both parties; and playing for time became increasingly difficult, particularly as, contrary to promises given to Mr. Ovey, Reza Khan continued to move his troops westwards of the line, Bebehan-Zaidun-Bander Dilam. 43. Early in November the Sheikh, influenced no doubt partly by His Majesty’s Government’s clear disapproval of his rebellion and partly by doubts as to the measure of support to be expected from the Bakhtiari and his other supporters, had decided to make his submission to Reza Khan; he expressed his readiness to meet the latter at Bushire provided that the meeting took place under the auspices of Sir P. Loraine and that the latter would give him assurances as to his safety. But Reza Khan was now becoming impatient at the delay, probably because the approach of winter would hamper military operations. Mr. Austen Chamberlain (who had succeeded Mr. Ramsay MacDonald at the Foreign Office) addressed a telegram to Sir P. Loraine on the 11th November explaining the view of His Majesty’s Government that the Sheikh, although to some extent provoked, had put himself in the wrong by planning rebellion and by insisting on the conditions (ii) and (iii) (see para. 38^ above); it was hoped that Sir P. Loraine would be able to show both sides the folly of pushing matters to an extreme; it might be necessary to speak strongly to the Sheikh because Reza Khan could not be expected to ignore the implications of the Sheikh’s telegrams to the Majlis and the foreign legations and to meet the Sheikh without some preliminary expression of the latter’s regret; the Sheikh could, however, be informed that, mindful of his loyal services during the war, His Majesty’s Government were still doing their best to help him out of a difficult predicament. Sir P. Loraine was informed that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to see the Sheikh expelled or unduly humiliated', nor did they wish to prejudice their improved relations with the Persian Government; it was not desired to fetter Sir P. Loraine with detailed instructions, but if he could persuade the Sheikh to make the first move towards reconciliation, it did not seem unlikely that Reza Khan would be found ready to listen to reason.

Loraine met the Sheikh at Ahwaz on the 13th December and persuaded him to address to Reza Khan a telegram of regret and submission, but now Reza Khan made difficulties and was guilty of a number of breaches oi iaith. The rebellion had collapsed and he wished to drive home his advantage, while at Tehran criticism was being voiced in the Majlis regarding foreign intervention in Persian internal affairs. Reza Khan now demanded the Sheikh s unconditional surrender instead of, as arranged, sending him a friendly message; Persian troops continued to move beyond the agreed line and Reza Khan expressed his of marching to Mohammerah; and he now made difficulties about meeting Sir P. Loraine and the Sheikh at Bushire, stating that this was no longer possible owing to the news of the proposal having leaked out. In addition, there was reason to believe that Moscow had put in a spoke to prevent a satisfactory arrange ment being reached. In view of Reza Khan s attitude and the failure of our policy of “ biased neutrality,” His Majesty’s Government and Sir P. Loraine now adopted a strong line with the Persian Government and Reza Khan, in the course of which the substance of the 1914 assurances to the Sheikh were disclosed to the Persian Government; the attitude of His Majesty’s Government now was that, by his submission, the Sheikh had put himself in the right, that they attached importance to abiding by their obligations to him (although, in view of the situation in Egypt following the murder of Sir Lee Stack on the 19th November, thev were anxious not to be embroiled in South Persia), that they were still desirous of doing everything in their power to secure a settlement satisfactory to the Persian Government, but that if the latter persisted in attacking the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government reserved to themselves the right to take such measures as they might think fit in pursuance of their assurances to the Sheikh. But the latter was now a sick man and had suffered a moral collapse, and Reza Khan, by taking full advantage of His Majesty’s Government’s desire to avoid complica tions. was master of the situation. Sir P. Loraine expressed doubts whether it would be possible to obtain terms for the Sheikh favourable enough to make it worth his while to remain in Khuzistan, but he eventually arranged for Reza Khan and the Sheikh to meet at Ahwaz on the 6th December. After a preliminary meeting, Sir P. Loraine spoke to the former, explaining the position of His Majesty’s Government and emphasising the scrupulous loyalty of their attitude and tlieir strong desire that the Sheikh’s position should be substantially maintained. Reza Khan’s reply was reassuring : he wanted to maintain the Sheikh in effective authority, but must arrange this in such a manner as to disarm his clitics in Tehran; he did not want a breadh with His Majesty’s Government and promised to hold up the advance of Persian troops. The result of the Ahwaz conference seemed to bear out Reza Khan’s promises. He and the Sheikh swore friendship on the Koran; Persian troops were to remain at Shustar till the spring when, except for detachments, they would be withdrawn provided the pacification of Luristan had been completed; as a temporary measure Reza Khan would appoint a governor at Ahwaz, but this governorship would be restored to the Sheikh in the spring and meanwhile the temporary governor would have no power to interfere with the Sheikh’s authority over the Arab tribes; minor points regarding jurisdiction, police, taxation, &amp;c., were reserved for subsequent discussion and all Persian officials, including the military, would have strict orders to work in harmony with the Sheikh and give him any help he might require. Reza Khan assured Sir P. Loraine that he would not allow agitation in Tehran to deflect him from his purpose and that Sir P. Loraine could be free from anxiety. Sir P. Loraine also reported that Reza Khan realised that the Soviets had been adopting a perfidious attitude throughout in an endeavour to prevent a peaceful settlement and to drive Reza Khan into armed action. The New Attitude of His Majesty's Government, 1925. 45. The immediate crisis was over but matters were by no means finally settled. It was clear, however, that the old regime had come to an end and that Reza Khan, having established a strangle-hold over Khuzistan would be unlikely ever voluntarily to relinquish it. His Majesty’s Government were now in an embarrassing position : the services which the Sheikh had rendered them in the past and general considerations of prestige in Persian Gulf made it undesirable that they should abruptly terminate their assurances to the Sheikh; the safety of the oilfields and of British lives had to be considered; but the assurances were not compatible with the general policy of strengthening the Central Government and the embarrassing position in which His Majesty’s Government found them selves presented the Soviet Government with wonderful opportunities for fishing in troubled waters. During his discussions with Reza Khan at Ahwaz,[32557] D 17 Sir P. Loraine had told him that the most serious danger of friction in South Persia between Great Britain and Persia would arise from friction between the latter and the Sheikh and that he believed that a close understanding between Reza Khan and the Sheikh would directly strengthen the position of Reza Khan and his Government in Tehran—which would be in accordance with the desires of His Majesty’s Government; he went further and stated that he wished all Great Britain’s friends in South Persia to be friends of Tehran and to help th# own Government and for the latter to feel that the south was safe, loyal and peaceful, so that, should danger arise from other quarters, the south could be relied on. In replying to Sir P. Loraine's report on his proceedings, Sir Austen Chamberlain said :— “ I share your view that the policy of His Majesty's Government in Persia should be to discourage separatist movements likely to weaken the central authority of the Persian Government and am of the opinion that the policy outlined in your despatch of rallying the tribal chieftains of South Persia to the support of the Persian Government is best calculated to improve the relations of His Majesty's Government with that Government. The chieftains themselves will thus be led to realise that their traditional friendship with His Majesty’s Government is fully compatible with their duty as loyal Persian subjects.” Sir P. Loraine was aiming at a final and honourable discharge of His Majesty's Government’s obligations to the Sheikh so that our future action on his behalf could be limited to securing, so far as possible without prejudice to our relations with the Persian Government, the observance of Reza Khan’s promises as regards the Sheikh’s future position, while continuing to urge the Sheikh to deal with Reza Khan direct in matters affecting his own position and authority. Given a correct attitude on the part of the Sheikh therefore, everything turned upon the good faith of Reza Khan. The Final Downfall of the Sheikh, 1925. 46. After the Ahwaz meeting, the Sheikh appears to have resigned himself to the new regime and his main concern was now to retain his properties; but he was in an uncomfortable position, because, with his loss of prestige, he had become the target for claims by many whom he had dispossessed while at the height of his power. He informed Reza Khan that he wished to divide his properties among his sons and travel abroad, but Reza Khan asked him not to leave Persia and urged him to proceed to Tehran, where his presence would greatly assist in the regularisation of the position as regards his properties. (Reza Khan may, or may not, at this time have been genuinely desirous of arriving at a satis factory settlement of the Sheikh’s affairs, but it is worthy of note that he subse quently mentioned to Sir P. Loraine the possibility that the Sheikh would retire to Iraq, where his presence would be an embarrassment to the Persian Government; no doubt this consideration played its part in Reza Khan’s anxiety to persuade the Sheikh to visit Tehran.) The Sheikh, in spite of reassuring messages from Reza Khan and of Sir P. Loraine’s advice to comply with Reza Khan’s request, was undoubtedly afraid to proceed to the capital. He spoke to the acting British Consul at Ahwaz on the 18th April about his grievances, main taining that Reza Khan had broken his promises to him and that he could no longer place any faith in his word; the Sheikh had been advised to rest, but if he went to Tehran he would be worried into his grave and doubted whether he would ever be allowed to leave the capital; such a journey would be a further humiliation and he could not go there as a suppliant seeking to regain property which was his legally. He eventually told Mr. Monypenny that, while he would not go himself, he would send a representative to Tehran; but this decision was too late, for on the same day he and his son, Abdul Hamid, were arrested by Reza Khan’s orders and taken to Tehran under escort. 47. Reza Khan sought to justify this new breach of faith as necessitated by the Sheikh’s refusal to proceed to Tehran voluntarily and by the possibility of his taking up residence in Iraq. To put himself right with Sir P. Loraine, he readily agreed to the latter’s suggestion that the Sheikh should receive a welcome on approaching Tehran and should “ arrive honourably and in no way under arrest,” and said that a house was being placed at his disposal at which his real personal friends (though not political agitators) could visit him. Sir P. Loraine’s view was that there were only two alternative methods of dealing with the E649/136/34/ 1925. E2100/136/ 34/1925. E1572/136/ 34/1925. E2502/136/ 34/1925. E3046/136/ 34/1925. E3407/136/ 34/1925. E3046/136/ 34/1925.M2801/136/ 34/1925 E 2856/136/ 34/1925. E 6023/1:36/ 34/1925. Persian Gulf Administration Report for 1925 E 6725/4360/ 34/1925 E3517/3066/ 34/1936. K 4817/453/ 234/1935, (&amp;C-, &amp;c. situation : either an attempt to patch it up or a definite breach with Reza Khan and a breach at this time would have been more than unfortunate as the prospects of settling the Persian debt question were quite hopeful and Russo-Persian relations were showing distinct signs of strain. He had, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, tried the first course and all now depended upon whether Reza Khan would arrange the Sheikh’s affairs in a satisfactory manner. At first, everything promised well as the Sheikh told Sir P. Loraine that he kod been treated with the greatest consideration and respect, that Reza Khan Cud given him a warm and affectionate welcome and had said that political considerations had obliged him to bring the Sheikh to Tehran as an act of authority but that there would shortly be a relaxation. In addition, Reza Khan renewed his promise to Sir P. Loraine to put the Sheikh’s affairs straight, undertaking, if the Sheikh behaved wisely, to rehabilitate his prestige in a public manner; and by the beginning of October Sir P. Loraine was able to report good prospects of a satisfactory settlement on the basis of the payment by the Sheikh of a sum of half a million tomans as his share of the expenses of the Khuzistan campaign of 1924, in return for which his firmans would be ratified and he would be allowed to return with tribal authority and high position (but without the right to have armed forces). 48. Although in certain quarters closely interested in the fate of the Sheikh there was a feeling that he had been “ let down ” by His Majesty’s Government, his arrest and removal to Tehran did not lead to a loss of British prestige to the extent that might have been expected given the key position which he had formerly held and the manner in which that position had been built up with the support of the British Government. As a measure of the interest taken in the event in this country it may be noted that it inspired only one question in Parliament, and that was answered without difficulty and without giving rise to supplementaries. As far as Khuzistan was concerned, apart from a purely local disturbance at the time of the arrest, the event was received with apparent indifference. The Sheikh’s son Abdullah acted as chief of the Muhaisin during his father’s absence (and, incidentally, did so more in his own than in his father’s interests). It is true that at the end of July, 1925 there was a short-lived tribal rising at Mohammerah (for which the Sheikh was in no way responsible), but this was due not so much to sympathy with the Sheikh in detention at Tehran as to other causes—economic factors, the removal of experienced head-men and the rule of Persian officials over Arabs, feared new taxation and threatened loss of properties, plus, it was suspected, Soviet intrigues. Subsequent negotiations and the death of the Sheikh. 49. Little object would here be served by a detailed account of the negotia tions between the Persian Government and the Sheikh during the latter’s last years at Tehran. It will suffice to record that the negotiations were marked not only by more than usual Oriental procrastination but also by gross breaches of faith on the part of the Central Government, who had obviously no intention of carrying out the promises given to the Sheikh and to Sir P. Loraine at the end of 1924 and subsequently and who were obviously merely waiting for the Sheikh to die. His Majesty’s Government continued unofficially to urge the Persian Government to come to a satisfactory settlement and release the Sheikh, but their efforts were unavailing and in the end even the Sheikh himself came to realise tJhat representations by His Majesty’s Legation on his behalf were more likely to do harm than good. After eleven years of detention. Sheikh Khazal died during the night of the 24th-25th May, 1936, having been deprived by the Persian Government of his estates in Khuzistan and without any settlement having been reached regarding the compensation which had been promised to him. In record ing the death of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran said : “ His epitaph might be what is perhaps the only genuine remark which the local authorities (in the person of Teymourtache in 1930) made about him, that the ‘ interests of the individual must be sacrificed to the public good.’ ” British relations with the Sheikh in matters outside Persian jurisdiction. 50. His Majesty’s Government, with the recollection of the Sheikh’s services in the past and with their inability to carry out the assurances which they had given him, had the Sheikh very much on their conscience. Consequently, they did their utmost to meet any claims which the Sheikh might have against them in so far as matters lay outside Persian jurisdiction. Thus, in 1935, they and the Government of India jointly made an ex gratia payment to him of 50,000 rupees in repayment of a loan which he had advanced to the Government of India in[32557] D 2 19 1924-25. This loan was in respect of the erection of consular premises at Ahwaz, the building of which had been commenced but had, after the fall of tfie Sheikh, been abandoned owing to certain town-planning schemes. The Sheikh’s title to the land in question was more than doubtful and he had none to the buildings except for the foundations; and it was not considered that he had any legal claim against either the Government of India or His Majesty’s Government in the matter. But the Foreign Office successfully urged that the loan should be regarded debt of honour and that it should be repaid on the grounds of His Majesty’s Government’s moral responsibility for doing anything possible for our former protege, who, in addition to his political fall, was now in grave financial straits. 51. The repayment of the loan in respect of the Ahwaz consular site was of relatively minor importance although illustrative of His Majesty’s Govern ment’s attitude. Of much greater importance, however, was the question of the Sheikh’s date gardens in Iraq, regarding which assurances had been given in 1914 (see last paragraph of Document No. 6 in the Annex). A detailed account of developments in this highly complicated question would be out of place in the present memorandum, but very briefly the position was as follows. The assurance to the Sheikh was fully implemented during the period when His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were responsible to the League of Nations for the administration of Iraq, but successive Iraqi Governments refused to accept the financial commitment in this assurance (and in a similar one given to the Sheikh of Koweit) as binding upon Iraq after the establishment of the indepen dence of that country in 1932. In that year the Iraqi Government altered their system of taxation upon agricultural products by a measure known as the Istihlak tax, as a result of which taxation was no longer levied on the land itself but on such parts of the crop as were sold or exported. It was decided that, in the ]||| 49/18j,93/ event of continued failure to persuade the Iraqi Government to accept the financial commitment to the two Sheikhs, an obligation to compensate the latter must rest upon His Majesty’s Government. The cases of the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit differed in that the latter was nominally independent whereas the former was not, and in any case the question arose whether Sheikh Khazal could have a “ successor ” in the sense of the 1914 assurances. It was decided, however, that in this matter the Sheikh should be treated during his life-time on the same basis as the Sheikh of Koweit and the whole question of compensation was under active consideration when Khazal died. The decision w T as then reached that pay ment of compensation for losses in respect of Istihlak taxation should be made to the Sheikh’s heirs on an ex-qratia basis, and in 1940/41 the sum of £15,218 was Ei 365 /iio/ distributed among them in full and final settlement of past losses on account of 93/mo this taxation since 1932 and of prospective further losses from this or alternative e 456, e 1836/ forms of taxation on the land or its produce; in return, the heirs (or their trustees ' in the case of minors) were required to sign documents accepting payment as a full settlement of any claims against His Majesty’s Government under the pledge given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah in 1914 in this particular regard. The fate of the British assurances. 52. While, as has been seen, the policy of His Majesty’s Government after the Sheikh’s rebellion in 1924 had been to endeavour honourably to disembarrass themselves of the assurances given to him in times when circumstances were very different, and while they could, on a strict reading of those assurances, have declared that the Sheikh’s disregard of their advice both in 1924 and in 1925 had rendered the assurances null and void, the fact is that they never did so. All was changed by the arrest of the Sheikh and subsequent acts of bad faith on the part of the Shah, and no purpose would have been served and the feelings of an old and sick man, who still regarded His Majesty’s Government with friendli ness and loyalty, would have been deeply wounded by any such action. The assurances therefore (for what they were now worth) were merely allowed to lapse on his death. In June, 1944, however, Sheikh Chassib, Khazal’s renegade eldest son, wrote to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran calling attention to the e4039/155/ assurances and enlisting the support of His Majesty’s Government in the demand M4 / 1944 of Sheikh Khazal’s family for the restitution of their rightful properties. His Majesty’s Government’s attitude towards any suggestion that their assurances extended after the death of Khazal to his family was explained to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in a despatch of the 29th August, 1944. After describing why the assurances were not regarded in principle as having lapsed during the Sheikh’s lifetime, this despatch made the following points :— (a) His Majesty’s Government need have no feelings of delicacy towards Sheikh Khazal’s heirs, as they had had towards the Sheikh himself,20 in divesting themselves of all future responsibility under the assurances in so far as they related to Persia; (b) it was true that the assurances spoke of the Sheikh’s successors, but there was no successor to the Sheikh in the position which he held when the assurances were given; (c) the assurances referred to the nomination of successors by the Sheikh, and consultation with and approval by His Majesty’s Governnmnt was provided for : but so far as was known, the Sheikh did nominate a successor and there was certainly no consultation with His Majesty’s Government in the matter; (d) if Sheikh Chassib, as the eldest son, regarded himself as the successor, he could hardly say that he had been guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government and had maintained an attitude satisfactory to that Government. Mr. Lascelles was therefore told that, in any dealings with Sheikh Chassib, His Majesty’s Legation should act on the assumption that His Majesty’s Govern ment were no longer bound by any assurances in respect of Sheikh Khazal himself or his family; this would not preclude His Majesty’s Legation from using their good offices on behalf of the family when this might appear desirable or expedient, but it should be understood by all concerned that any action taken in this sense would be as a matter of grace and not of obligation. HUGH K. GREY. Foreign Office, October 1946. ANNEX. Texts of British Assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, 1902-14. No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) 7th December, 1902. I write to inform you, my honoured friend, of my return to Tehran from Europe and to enquire after your health. It was a great disappointment to me that I was unable to visit you this spring, but, as you know, I was obliged to go to England instead. I hope, however, that it may be possible for me at no distant date to have the pleasure of making your personal acquaintance. I was very glad to hear from Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar of the satisfactory arrangement concluded between you and the Department of Customs. On general grounds of policy it is very desirable that differences should as far as possible be avoided between the Persian authorities and the Arab tribes under your rule. The relations between the British and Persian Governments are of a friendly character, and the preservation of the integrity and independence of the Persian monarchy has for many years been one of the great objects of British policy in this part of the world. Disturbances of a nature to imperil that object would be a serious evil, and you would gain little and might endanger much by throwing off the sovereignty of the Shah. I am convinced that, under the present circum stances, the Arabs, and yourself as their ruler, have every interest in cultivating 1 good and loyal relations with the Government of Tehran, and that the latter has no desire to oppress you or curtail your authority. For this reason I think vou acted wisely in giving up all idea of forcible resistance to the establishment of a custom-house, and in seeking rather to come, as I have from the first urged vou to do, to a friendly understanding on the subject with the Customs Administration Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar asked me on your behalf to what extent you might relv on the protection of the British Government, and I told him that so long as vou behaved to us as you have done in the past, in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of vour hereditary rights and customs, and to dissuade the Government of Tehran IrZ any endeavour to dimmish or interfere with them. Hajii R^is therenrw&gt; that you were not afraid of the Persian Government itlel^nor of Sk by21 neighbouring tribes acting or professing to act under its orders; but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign Power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways: either such a foreign Power might be at war with Persia, and might, as an enemy of the Shah, send ships to attack your district; or such a Power, pretending to be the friend of the Persi an Government or to act on its behalf, might attempt, also by means of its to conquer you and the Arabs. I replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely, but if either were to arise we should, I believed, interfere, provided you had acted in accordance with our advice; and our fleet, which is the strongest of any in the Gulf, would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. J stated, however, that I would refer these questions to the Foreign Minister of the British Government, and he has now authorised me to say that we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support. As I have, however, said above, I do not regard the danger—at any rate at present—as a real one. The Persian Government desires, I am sure, as earnestly as you do, the preservation of peace in Arabistan, and the establishment of a custom-house at Mohammerah is, as I assured you last year, a fiscal, not a political, measure. It has already informed me in a friendly spirit of the conditions under which the new arrangement has been made, and the British Government has instructed me to intimate its acquiescence in them. We reserve, of course, our right to object to any further change which we may consider likely, as affecting peace and trade on the Karun, to be detrimental to our interests. I trust that the new arrangement may work smoothly. There will be very likely some small difficulties and friction at first, but I trust to your wisdom and judgment to deal with them prudently and patiently. Our consul has my orders to afford you all help and advice, and you may place every reliance on my friendship. You can write to me freely should you wish to do so, as well as to the Resident at Bushire. ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. No. 2. Sir A . Hardinge to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, 2±th December, 1903. I have received a telegram in reply to the one to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Mohammerah, after my first interview with your Excellency. Lord Lansdowne says that if, as he presumes is the case from my account of your Excellency’s statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repudiate the arrangement made with you last year, I am authorised to say that you are, in his opinion, justified in opposing such attempt. He instructs me to remind you of the message which he sent you last year, and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observe the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself . He has authorised me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting the conditions of the arrangement on their side. I do not propose to do so until I hear further from you, as I think it will be better in the interests of good relations between the Persian authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked until all other means of adjusting matters directly between them and you have been exhausted. Meanwhile, I should be obliged if you would send me to Tehran, through His Majesty’s Resident at Bushire, a copy of the note from M. Naus, promising not to take duty on your personal imports, and any further information on the subject. r h^vp Rro ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. M' 22 No. 3. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) Is? December, 1908. After enquiry after your welfare and congratulations on the satisfactory conclusion of your business with the Arab tribes, I have the honour to inform w&gt; u that I duly communicated to Government all that passed at the interview wl^ih I and our friend Mr. McDouall had with your Excellency on the 7th January last, and also placed before them the statement of Government expenditure subsequently received from you through Mr. McDouall. The reply of His Majesty’s Government reached me through His Majesty’s Legation in September last, but, in view of the importance of the subject and the insecurity of the post, I thought it best to delay addressing you until my return to headquarters. On arrival here I learnt of your own absence in Arabistan, and have since waited for your return to Failieh. I am directed to repeat, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, the assurances given to your Excellency in the letter of His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, dated the 7th December, 1902, which is in your possession, and the terms of which I repeated to you at our interview above referred to, and I am then to add that His Majesty's Government now extend those assurances to your successors. I am further to point out that His Majesty’s Government have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, and to explain that that under taking involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country, and includes the continuance of the state of autonomy which your Excellency at present enjoys. It follows from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity which is recognised by the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention. Trusting to have an opportunity of repeating the foregoing assurances in person at an early date, I am, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Pars, &amp;c. No. 4. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After the usual compliments.) Mohammerah, \§th May, 1909. On the 1st December, 1908, I had the honour, by the direction of His Majesty’s Government, to repeat to your Excellency the assurances given you on behalf of Government by his Excellency Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, in his letter of the 7th December, 1902, to your address, and to inform you that the British Government were now prepared to extend those assurances to your successors. I was further directed to explain to you that the British Government had engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and that that undertaking in itself involved the maintenance of the status quo in Persia, and thus included the continuance of the same state of autonomy which your Excel lency at present enjoys. I was then to point out that it followed from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an act of infringement of that Persian integrity which has received recognition in the Anglo-Russian Convention. While expressing your thanks for these amplified assurances, you repre sented that they seemed to you only to safeguard you so long as Persia continued to exist as a sovereign State, and you pressed for &amp; further assurance which would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a sovereign State and the inter vention or occupation by foreign Powers. You also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provided immunity against unwarrantable encroachment on your rights by the absolute government of His Majesty the Shah, or whether it also covered prevention of23 similar action on the part of parliamentary government. In reply to those representations, your Excellency was informed that Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, the British Government were not, properly speaking, able to admit even the possibility of Persia ceasing to be a sovereign State or coming under the occupation of a foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency the assurances already given to your E^ellency would become even more binding than before. wl was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now pre pared to extend the application of those assurances to your “ heirs and successors.” Mr. McDouall and I have informed you that in our opinion the assurances as now extended and expressed, appear to satisfy all your requirements; but you have further requested that the words “ heirs and successors ” may be changed and the words “ own successive male descendants ” may be written instead; and you have gone on to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government will be pleased to dispel the last shadow of doubt from your mind regarding their own intentions in the future, by adding after the words “male descendants” as above, the words “ up to a period of 100 years ” (or if it be possible 150 years). I cannot give your Excellency any reply on this point without reference to Government, but I will lose no time in communicating to them your representations. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. No. 5. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) Mohammerah, \5th October, 1910. I have the honour to intimate personally and in writing that I am authorised to inform your Excellency that whatever change may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself, and are intended to extend to your male descendants so long as you and they shall not have failed to observe your obligations towards the central Government, and shall continue to be acceptable to your tribesmen, to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to them. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf. No. 6. Sir Percy Cox to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) ttnd November, 1914. With reference to the assurances conveyed to your Excellency in my letter dated the 15th October, 1910 ( = llth Shawwal, 1328), and having regard to the further valued services and co-operation which your Excellency has rendered to the British Government and British interests in Arabistan and the Shatt-el-Arab, I am now authorised to assure your Excellency personally, and do so by this■ ' ' ^ - 24 writing, that whatever change may take place in the form of the government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution, both to yourself and to us, in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against any unprovoiked attack by a foreign Power, or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised righti^r on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and their obligations towards the Persian Government, provided always that the nomination of your successors from among your male descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of, His Majesty’s Government, and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. Vis-a-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy. Further, the date gardens which you now possess on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs, and immune from taxation. P. Z.

Dear Harrison, I enclose a copy of a draft telegram to Tehran, about the question of making an allowance to Abdullah Khazaal. //ill you please let me E 9965/402/34 know whether you concur in the terms of this telegram?FOREIGN OFFICS, S./.l lltli October, 19^6 ' Gonfidential. -jear Harrison 4P Would you please refer to your letter No, Ext. 6672/46 of 3rd. October about an ex gratia paynent of £73 to Sheikh Abdullah Khazaal. 7e have considered the question of making an allowance to Abdullah, and come to the conclusion that it would be undesirable to do so. The only advantage would be that we might in this way be able to persuaue him to live further . off from South Persia, so that His llajesty’s Government • might not be exposed to thd.Charge of harbouring him te-w* Koweit (and, if he gets away, returning him to rersih.) ’.7e should in effect be making an allowance to Abdullah, alone among, the numerous members of his clan, because he has made a nuisance of himself. To do so would set a premium on trouble-making, and might encourage other members of the family to try tbe same game. It is also most undesirable that His Lajeaty’s Government should provide a pension for a Persian sheikh who has rjust been in open revolt against his government. This would lend colour to the allegations so frequently made in Tudeh and Russian propaganda that His Majesty^ Government are giving support to rebellious elements in Persia. ;/e cannot therefore agree that any share of the proposed ex gratia payment should be debited to His Majesty's Government. The next step would be, in our opinion, to warn the Persian Government that we can take no responsibility for Abdullah Khazaal's movements, but that we would be willing to pass on to him any message from the Persian Government about the fate that would await him if he were found to have /re-entered F.A.K.

Shaikhs told me that they had no confidence in the Persian Government or Chassib and had decided that they must resist. They were anxious that British Government should know in case Anglo-Iranian Oil Company installations on Abadan and Ismailia might be involved. They wished to inform His Majesty's Consul-General Ahwaz and His Majesty's Consul Khorammshahr direct but could not as they wore under constant observation. They had therefore come to Basra instead to inform me. I gathered that they^would have liked His Majesty's Consul-General Ahwaz to discuss situation with Governor-General.

Dear Pj'iaan, V V7ith reference to the Political Resident’s telegrams No. T/332 and T/356 about ^ieikh Abdullah bin Khazal and to our comrersatiai cn the subject the other day, we have now considered the matter further here. 2. Our own view is that the question of a British pension for Sheikh Abdullah ought to be put up to the Treasury. The Political Resident and H.M. Ambassadors at Bagdad and Tehran are all of the opinion that a British pension should be granted and this indeed seems to be the only really satisfactory solution. Hie political Resident’s sugestion that Abdullah should be deported to Aden or some other Crown Colony should also in our view be considered. If the Foreign Office are now prepared to agree, you will no doubt initiate the necessary action. 3# In the meantime, would you let me know whether you / concur in the attached draft telegram to the Political Resident? / K. HARRISONI agree that we should urge the ^reign Office to press the Treasuiy tu f sanction a pension for Abdulla, he should I siiggest also urge them to consider the other recommendation at the end of the P.R* s telegram No.T.332.

The late Sheikh Khazal of Kohamnerah, who was deposed by the Persian G-overment for insncr^ction in 1925 a nd removed to, Tehran,had four sons. Of these, Ghassib and Abdulla have been active in attempting to secure the return of their private property in llohammerah and it was recently reported that Chassib was likely to receive substantial compensat ion from the Persian Governuent, (dxt.4678/2}£). Ab&amp;ulla, however, is more unstable and has put himself hopelessly in the wrong with the Persians by making several attempts to recapture his ancestral home at pailiyeh by force, the latest having been launched from Iraqi territory. Upon the failure of this he received an asylum from the Sheikh of Kuweit where he is at present. About two years ago Sheikh Chassib produced a copy of a letter given to his father by Col. Knox and later also in a slightly revised form by Sir Percy Cox. The text of this, together with the Poreign Office* s view (which is that it was genuine enough but that the liability of H.1UG to support Sheikh Khazal* s * successor? has in any case lapseo. as the Sheixh had/had no 'successor') will be found at Ext* 3885/44*) At the same time it is felt in the Gulf that we have failed to honour our bond (see para.5 of Sir G. Prior’s record of his interview with Sheikh Abdulla at Ext. 30 Aj 6/4£&gt;) and H«Lt.G• has shown a sense of general responsibility for Sheikh Khazal's sons (e.g. by su x $artihg Chassib* s representations in Tehran)• The future of Sheikh ^.bdulla therefore presents a good deal of difficulty. The alternatives open to him are;- (1) . To return to Persia . In this case, as Sir G. Prior told him, he would certainly hapg. (2) . To go back to Iraq. His assets in Iraq are exhausted even if (as the Ambassador thinks,likely, see Ext. 3523/4^) his twmupWMHI trial for his raid into Persia ends in acquittal. (3) . To remain in Kuweit . Abdulla has given the Sheikh his word (which for^so mercurial a person may not be of much value) not to return to Persia without permission. The Sheikh is giving him an allowance at present but will clearly not do so indefinitely - see Ext#4747/ (h) . To be deported with an allowance to a Crown Colony . The Political Resident at first suggested (Ext.723/4^) Palestine or Transjordan, but this was turned dowr/* down by the Foreign Office. The Governnent of India do not seea to have replied to the suggestion in our telegram No. 3151 °f 13th February that he might go there. The latest suggestion frcm the Political Resident is that he should be sent to aclen. The Political Resident and HJ.I. .Ambassadors, Bagdad and Tehran (Gxt. 4678 /^) are now unanimous that a pension is the only solution. The Foreign Office were originally vigorously opposed to this (Ext.379V 46 } but it is understood that though still reluctant they would now probably be prepared to raise the question with the Treasury ifppressed^f^Tn the meanwhile they think we should instruct the Political Resident that Sheikh Abdulla may remain in Kuweit and that the Political Agent, Kuweit should be instructed to report immediately to HJ,:. Consul, Khorramshah if Abdulla breaks away so that the Consul may warn the Persians. A short draft telegram on the lines of the last sentence is submitted accordingly. f,0. -. nh-^U' l*.

Abadan situation as it was yesterday briefly as follows: the main issue is pay on Friday. Union leaders agree that other points can be settled by discussion but definite in their demand that the main issue be decided at once. Anglo Iranian Oil Company explained that this demand if agreed to would cost them about one million sterling and that they would naturally have to refer the matter to their London office. The union leaders agreed more time was necessary but naively hinted that they must have something definite to show the workers in the immediate future and asked the company to suggest date. Anglo Iranian Oil Company suggested July 13th and the leaders agreed. Anglo Iranian Oil Company think this impatience on the part of the union leaders is due to the fact that they realise that they are losing control of the workers and if they are to maintain any degree of control at all they must produce immediate results. In the meantime the Anglo Iranian Oil Company heard from Tehran that the question of Friday pay was being discussed at higher level and that the Pssrsian Government would decide what the minimum living wage should be. At the same time London office have telegraphed to say that local management are empowered to accede to the main demand in an emergency but that it would be more expedient that the issue should be decided in Tehran. If the Government [? grp. omitted] no then the answer to the union leaders should be no. If —• • the decisionthe decision was favourable to the union then the Anglo Iranian Oil Company would be complying with the Government’s recommendations and not Tudeh demands. The Anglo Iranian Oil Company now fear that if the central Govern ment do not agree to the demand they will be faced with general strike by the workers who will probably refuse- to listen to their leaders. If the Government do agree they will have bought temporary breathing space at considerable cost. Above all they fear Government procrastination in Tehran which will mean they will have to inform the leaders that they must wait longer for final decision. They doubt whether the workers will be satisfied with this and y feel that they may take matters into their own hands and strike. / 5. Gobey is going to Ahwaz today to discuss matters with the Governor General. He is anxious that union leader Najafi should not be removed as the Anglo Iranian Oil Company find him fairly reasonable to deal with. 4. To Tehran, Ahwaz and Government of India only. Arabs.

Now at last it looks as if Chassib is going to get something substantial but ^bdullah will not be benefited as he is regarded by Persian Government as rebel who has forfeited all rights.

His Majesty's Government could hardly sponsor the return of Sheikh ^bdullah as he was regarded by the Persian authorities as inimical to heir interests.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Office telegra.m Eo.267 dated 5th April 1946 to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Baghdad, arid To say that while in Kuwait I received a visit from Shaikh Abdulla bin Khazal and enclose a copy of a letter which he sent me. During his visit Shaikh Abdulla spoke Persian at his own request, and it is clear that this really is his mother- tongue, and that he is more Persian than Arab. He was expensively dressed in semi-Arab attire, and did not appear to me a type who was likely to receive much sympathy in this somewhat austere town. I could not give him as much time as I should have wished as my stay in Kuwait was very brief. 2. He began by explaining his case at some length very much on the lines expressed in his letter. He said that while we had helped our enemies we had done little for our friends. The Bakhtiar£i, Ariose attitude towards us had been doubtful, were wealthy and in high positions, and the Qashqai, who had been definitely hostile, had settled their affairs and were in full possession of their properties. We had prevented Shaikh Khazal’s family from helping themselves and had done nothing for them ourselves. What were the promises which had been made to Shaikh Khazal ? Why had we done nothing to honour them ? Why were they begging their bread ? Over 20 years had passed and we were no nearer a solution and their condition was getting worse every day. 3. I thought it better to be frank, and I told him that his letter appeared to show that he was mentally unbalanced. I said he was in no sort of position to combat propaganda or actively support religious refor^f, or rescue his country, and lhat we had certainly never given him the slightest encouragement to undertake anything of this sort. The action he had taken could only affect his family very seriously and must have set back any hope of a settlement. He expressed the view that he had done nothing beyond return to his native country. I asked him what would happen to any unwelcome exile who returned to Kuwait with a posse of gunmen and set himself up in his former habitation. Would not Shaikh Ahmad ‘immediately move against him ? If his intentions were peaceable why had he taken these tufangchis with him ? He told me that he had been in touch with the Persian Consul in Basra, but had been unable to extract any definite answer from him whether he could or could not visit / his.... N/ V': r OFPIOV r 41 ;?l2 - ills native country and that he had repeatedly seen everyone in the Baghdad Embassy and that he had merely taicen these men with him because he was uncertain what reception he might receive. I told him that if he were ever to return to Persia again, he could be quite certain what reception he would receive, as he would almost certainly be hanged# 4. He then asked me what he should do# He had so Id all his property in Iraq, and could not return there as they would imprison him, nor could he live for ever in Kuwait# He had no funds and was too proud to beg. He could not forget that he was the son of Sahikh Khazal# He asked me to tell him as a father mhat he should do# I replied that it was easier to t ell him what not to do and that was never to return to Persia as he would certainly be executed. As for what he should do now I would require time for thought. 5# Shaikh Khazal’s family is, of course, now no concern of this Residency, except in so far as our omission to honour our bond affects our good name among the Arab States in the Gulf# Only the obaer day Mr. Jameson of the Anglo-1 rani an Oil Company informed me that Major Holmes* triwp card in blocking a purely British oil concession in ; Kuwait had been the fate of Shaikh Khazal# Mr. Harold Uicholson when Charge d 1 Affaires at Tehran, drew attention nearly twenty years ago to the fact that nothing had been done to carry out our promise, and little progress appears to have been made since then# My impression is that sooner or later His Majesty , s Government will have to subsidise Shaikh Abdullah bin Khazal, and probably other members of his family as well, but the first point to be settled appears to be the terms upon which he can be allowed to return to Iraq# 6# I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Ambassadors in Tehran and Baghdad and the Political Agent,Kuwai t.

Shaikh Abdulla, son of the late Shaikh Shazal Khan, crossed the frontier with a number of armed Arabs in the early hours of the 10th morning, disarmed the G-endarmerie post at Failiyeh Palace, and occupied the Palace. In his letter to the Khuzistan Governor-General, copies of which were sent to H.M. Consulate-General at Ahwaz, and H.M. Consulate, Khorramshahr, he expressed his loyalty to the Persian Government, and requested the Governor-General of Khuzistan to meet his return, after so many years, with good faith. The Governor of Khorramshahr, immediately on receipt of this news, issued instructions to the Khorramshahr Gendarmerie and Garrison to arrest him. Skirmishes took place between the Arabs and Khorramshahr forces until 4 o'clock in the evening, when the Officer Commanding the Khuzistan Army Division, accompanied by 240 soldiers equipped with field pieces and machine guns arrived in Khorramshahr from Ahwaz. As they could not surround the Palace on their arrival owing to the approach of darkness, action was postponed till the next day, all necessary precautions being taken to provide against any attack on the town. On the next day it was discovered that he had withdrawn to the Iraq side of the frontier during the night. First reactions to Abdullah's intrusion were of an alarmist nature, and numbers of families deposited their movable wealth in the bank, and sought shelter in each others houses. Conditions quickly returned to normal after it was learned that Abdullah had withdrawn.? 1 ii wmmm FILE COPY With th«( ^ &gt;, C f r h •&gt; -' / * Under ?-■ ' &gt; of Stat&lt;i for ForrJii** Miiairs Nt. r &lt;9 1573 7 vv SECRET i n ap &lt;• 4 MAR 1946 ^ ■ lc iO&lt;t /^oq ho [CYPHER] DEPARTMENTAL N0.1.

Your Excellency, / 0 thQ honour to to‘my telegram No.9, dated the 12th Ja^ary, 1946, and to report as follows on the incTdent of Shaikh Abdullah bin Khazal's return to Khorramshahr. letter addressed to the Governor-General of Khuzistan, and copied to British and Persian officials, in which Shaikh Abdullah announced his return to the former palace of Shaikh Khazal at Pailiyeh, and stated that he wished to live there in peace. Shortly afterwards the Governor ceT Khorramshahr asked me to see him. In the meantime I had received a report that numbers of Arabs were crossing the river in balams from the Iraqi side and joining Shaikh Abdullah at Pailiyeh. The Governor asked my advice as to how he should deal with this Intrusion. I replied that whatever protestations Shaikh Abdullah may have made regarding his peaceful intentions, his unannounced arrival in Pailiyeh with an armed following of Iraqis constituted a threat to security. In consequence therefore I felt that the Governor would be fully justified in taking immediate steps to effect his arrest provided he felt strong enough to do this successfully. The Governor assured mo that he had sufficient strength to deal with the situation, as it had been reported up to that time. _ He seemed however under some doubt as to whether it would not be advisable to negotiate before taking military action. I reminded the Governor that any hesitation at this stage may be interpreted as a weak ness and result in a rally of local tribes to Abdullah's side. Further, I pointed out that negotiations entailed giving, as well as taking, and enquired whether in the event'of negotiations being opened, the Governor was prepared to give, if so, what? The Governor fully appreciated the dangers of hesitation and, since he was not in any case prepared to make concessions to Abdullah, decided Immediately to despatch forces and arrest Abdullah, and gave orders for a mixed company of soldiers and gendarmerie to move on Pailiyeh. 3. This company came into contact with Abdullah's followers about mid-day and exchanged a few shots, wounding one or two men on each side. The company then appeared to hesitate and there was again some talk of negotiating. I once more reminded the Governor of the dangers of delay and he decided to go on with the operation. By this time news had been received that Sarhang Ashfar-Oghlu was moving down from Ahwaz with reinforcements. He arrived shortly before dark, and, since it was too late to do anything more that night, took up outpost positions cutting off Pailiyeh from the rest of Khorramshahr. I saw Sarhang Ashfar- Oghlu late that night. He told me that ho had brought down three guns and three hundred soldiers from Ahwaz, that more could bo brought down if necessary, that ho had been in communication with Tehran and received strict instructions to settle with Shaikh Abdullah once and for all. He accordingly proposed to attack early the next morning . I wished him success, but took the opportunity to remind him that there appeared to have been no local rally to Shaikh Abdullah, and urged that he should remember this after the completion of his mission, since any unnecessary harassing of the local Arabs would not be justified and would only serve to increase Arab ill-will. 4. The next morning Sarhang Afshar-Oghlu captured Failiyeh after only very light opposition. It appeared that Shaikh Abdullah and the majority of his followers had withdrawn to the Iraqi side during the ni ght. 2 .

Thanks to prompt action by General Officer Commanding (and to the fact that where the Allied troops are British the Persian authorities are not hampered in defence of their national interests) Abdullah and the perhaps 300 or 400 Arabs who followed him from Iraq were easily dislodged and on December 12th His Majesty 5 s Consul at Mohammerah reported situation was virtually back to normal^ 2. Incident gave rise to wildest ravings in Tehran where it was reported 'on good authority” that there had been an Arab rebellion in Khuzistan on a large scale and that Arabs had captured Ahwaz. Deduction was made by some that British had brought about rebellion as a warning that they could play Russian game if they wished and when affair was already over journal de Tehran had an article in which the incident was represented as pretty much of equal weight as the troubles in the North. Fortunately it was able to give British journalists correct information and to explain the background.

In the first place the Government of India are unaware of the view held by His Majesty's Government as to the extent to which those assurances extended on the denth of Shaikh Wiazal to his heirs and the circumstances in which such liability as His Majesty's Government were prepared to assume in respect of his sons would be invalidated oy the actions of all or any of the latter. In paragraph 6 of his despatch No.274, dated 30th May 1936, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reporting the death of Shaikh Knazal. Mr. Nevile Butler said H The assurances which His Majesty's Government gave him do not, as far as I understand, extend in any way to his heirs”. It has not been possible to trace any subsequent correspondence contain ing the views of His Majesty's Government on this point, and the Government of India are therefore not in a position to comment on the effect of the activities which led to the recent arrest in Basra of Shaikh Chassib and his brother Abdulla upon such of the Knox/Cox assurances as His Majesty's Government may have decided to extend on Shaikh Khazal's death to his heirs. 3. In the second place the Government of India are not in possession of particulars of the negotiations said to be in progress between Shaikh Chassib and~the Persian Government. 4. It appears, however, to the Government of India that prima focie the Khox/Cox assurances impose on His Majesty's Government a moral obligation to bring the Persian Government to effect without further delay a just and reasonable settle ment of the dispute concerning the properties in Persia held by the late Shaikh IGiazal. 5.

I notice, however, that there is no mention of this document in the printed collection of 'Treaties and Under takings in Force between the British Government and the Sheikh of,Mohammerah, 1999-1919', printed at Calcutta in 1919, and it seems at any rate curious that there is no mention of Colonel Knox’ letter in the letter signed by Sir ercy Cox, addressed to the sheikh on the 21st Nov ember, 1914, only a few weeks after Colonel Knox appears to have written. The Knox document certainly dre^&amp;llude to the continuance of the assurances to the male heirs of the late sheikh, without any limitation concerning the nomination of successors with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. 3. I should, therefore, be grateful to be in formed whether the document alleged to have been signed by Colonel Knox is genuine or not, and to receive, if pos sible, a certified copy thereof. I should also be grateful for any observations which ttiegovernment of India and the Foreign Office (to whom I am sending a copy of this despatch /may care under No.271 of the 50th June, 1944)/concerning the two to make/ documents mentioned above and their bearing on the negotiat ions between the Persian Government and Sheikh Chassib which are now in progress.

There is no one who can deny this loyalty of this family. Modem history in- --H.cates a word in this regard for the excellent services done during .. ' last World rar by the late father of this family, which cannot be enumerated. He died with full enthusiasm and love to his illy Great Britain, his offsprings as well have the same loyalty and love in their hearts. It appears that circumstances have not been in favour of this family in order to en ble them to manifest their loyalty, but on the other hand they can see no reason why they should be encountered with such stiffness and lack of facilities by the British Government officials. Furthermore, they have a pact which includes the following: The British Givernment undert; Ices and guarantees our internal independ ence in \rabistan and at the same time undertakes not to touch our' properties and lands, that are In Iran with any misusage or offence. But we regret to see that net a single worftd of this pact (which m considered to be the best heritage that we have had inherited from our loyal father) has been complied with either in his favour or in favour of his heirs, but on the contrary we see some persons whose properties have been confiscated and were driven out of their positions during the Sx-Pahlawi 1 s reign have been returned whereas this un fortunate family alone has been deprived of this privilege because of her silence. e therefore put our full confidence in the British Govern ment , asking Your Excellency to take into consideration the bad financi* position of this family. It is a known fact that every member of this family can return to his position among his tribes, with the certainty that the latter are everready to obey orders to fight with their sole enemy the Government of Iran. The above mentioned facts we believe will justify the end of our silence, in demanding the return of our properties in Iran. Your Excellency may rest assured that the family of Skeikh Khaxal does not want the intervention of any individual, but the British Government officials to solve her complicated matters, we believe that should Your Excellency choose to give this letter the same consideration as our previous one the conclusion to be drawn is that Your Excellency have not complied with the conditions of the pact which is in our possession and we then see that either we have to come to a conclusion with the Iranians Yifho con i sea ted our propertier or, something will be done to alter the present situation.

I am sorry if, owing to the fact that this # complicated question is new to me, my telegram No. 89 contained point which needed no clarifying. I have not mis-read paragraph 2 of your telegram 72 but had serious misgivings about formal difficulties of action you proposed. 2) Prime Minister has now, as I feared, taken the line that treatment accorded by Persian Government to their own nationals is exclusively their own affair. I have of course emphasised our moral obligation to ensure if possible an equitable settlement for heirs of our former protege, but this does not get round Prime Minister s genuine objection, on the score of form, to furnishing a foreign power with what amounts to a safe conduct for a couple of disaffected Persian nationals. Hq has asked in particular why his government should bind themselves in advance to permit return to a neighbouring country of influential Persians who had already threatened to make trouble from there at a time when they still stood a chance of reaching a settlement, and who would obviously become still more obstreperous if negotiations broke down. 3) I think there is still a chance of my being able to extract an uno fficial promise provided that we, on our side, undertake to have the two sheiks kept well away from frontier zone and under adequate surveillance in the event of their returning empty handed. But I can well imagine that as such an undertaking would have to be for an indefinite period it might be awkward to give it, I should be grateful for your observations on this point.

Though doubtful, as I said to the GovernorKreneral, whether Chassib was under surveillance I felt Persian military, situation sufficiently difficult to^warrant my complying. Moreover Chassib's presence was having adverse effect on grain collection arrangements. I sent Persian member of my staff but Chassib made pretext not to come in. On May 11th I sent Vice-Consul Wooller with instructions to tell Chassib [grp. undec.] to return to Basra since his entry without proper papers and with armed men was irregular.

The Governor of Khorramshahr called on me yesterday and asked my advice regarding dealings with Sheik Chassib. I pointed out that he was m the Ahwaz district and did not concern the Waziri. I took with me Haji Ali Faisali, an Arab leader here, who has been most co-operative with Persia and us and whose advice might carry weight with Chassib. We met Chassib at Qajiriyeh where he was installed with some 200 armed followers. I carried the Governor’s message, and Chassib sard he was ready to go anywhere the authorities dictated in Persia, but could not [?gps.omitted.] me directly, but that to avoid trouble spreading to this neighbourhood it seems advisable to apprehend him. I hoped that it would not be necessary to take measures against the Arabs of this district who had, so far at least, not identified themselves, with him. The Governor asked me if I could meet Chassib and explain that his action would inevitably have unpleasant repercussions upon the Arabs of this district, and to endeavour to persuade him to return to Basra and negotiate any claims he had to make in the proper [?2 gps.omitted?manner, but] on any account return to Basra. He produced a Persian passport (up till now he is supposed to have been an Iraqi subject and actually also possesses an Iraqi passport) and claimed to be a^Persian subject and therefore entitled to remain in Persia. He denied having received any order preventing him from doing so._ He only demanded what he termed his rights to live in Khuzistan and pursue his claims to the restoration of his properties, and freedom of his people from oppression. I tpld hinp that he could not have set about his project in a more ill-advised manner, that to surround himself with a band of armed followers was most foolish and that he would do far better to return to Basra as asked. As he refused I returned to Khorramshahr and informed the Governor of the position saying that I could do nothing further and that the affair was a domestic one between the Persian authorities and Chassib. That Chassib had apparently written to the Governor-General and telegraphed the Prime Minister, and that the Governor General would no doubt deal with him. I reiterated that my only concern was that the people of this district who had not identified themselves with Chassib should not be interfered with. His brother Abdul Aziz v/ho, as reported in my despatch of February 6th 1943, is working at Khorramshahr as labpur contractor for British and United States army, v/as with him and in spite of protestations to the contrary is obviously working for Chassib. I informed the Governor that if it was his intention to prevent his return here I had nothing to say. 3. I warned the Governor that from what I had seen I was sure that Chassib would show fight if it was decided to arrest him and that an adequate force was essential. The attempt two / daysH - . - 2 - days ^ ago by a few gendarmes to catch him had ended in their hurried withdrawal and further encouragement to the Arabs. 4. The Governor has’ now informed me that the Governor General has asked him^to send Haji Ali Faisali to Chassib asking him to go within 24 hours to Ahw'az to discuss his claims and if he does not the consequences will be serious, ana that Faisali declares he has no nope of success unless he carries a letter from a British officer guaranteeing Chassib s safety. I have told the Governor that if they require such assistance from us the Governor General should approach His Majesty's Consul-General in Ahwaz. J learn that the people of Shadgan are also showing signs or [2gps.undec.]s and combining with Chassib, and it c dean that^this moment of preoccupation of the Persian lorces m other theatres has been chosen, whilst the Arabs leei sure tnat the British will not intervene provided they keep clear of our direct interests. They feel therefore that rnis is at last their chance of remedying their long felt, ana, one must admit to a considerable extent justified, grievances, and will not easily let it slip.

It is clear that sufficient Persian forces are not at present available for dealing with all contingencies in the south. Military iittachd has from *the outset* made constant representations to the Ministry of War for the despatch of reinforcements but so far without success. In view of the latest developments he will again approach the Minister of War on the subject but general lack of available troops makes it doubtful whether his representations will meet with any more success than in the past. In present circumstances it would be highly dangerous for Persian authorities to take the initiative in forcing the issue with Chassib, unless they are sure of success, which does not appear to be the case. Failure might only lead to general conflagration possibly entailing armed intervention on our part, which it is most important to avoid. Threats by Persian authorities, unless backed by force, would be worse than useless. If, as I assume, Chassib cannot be induced to return to *Iraq* without the use of force, only alternative would be for Persian authorities to enter into negotiations with Chassib with a view to finding basis for satisfactory settlement of his claims. If this line is adopted, you may, subject to any views expressed by Foreign Office or *Paiforce* place your good offices at the disposal of the Governor General and at the same time put strong pressure on Chassib to adopt a reasonable attitude. a f /1 0 HHHHi FlfiF 03 WYtt the CowipflmMU of the Uodei* S^c^tary of StoAo for Foroijin^^ffaii^t tzwftofsu.

Taking advantage of the lack of troops in this area on account of Bakhtiari operations and lack of reinforcements, Chassib son of the late Sheik Mohammerah has paid unauthorised visit from Basra and established himself at Khajeriyeh between Ahwaz and Khorramshahr. 2. Governor General ordered his arrest but Gendarmerie failed to effect this on account of his armed following. His Majesty s Consul at Khorramshahr states that at the request of local Governor he saw Chassib yesterday, asked what he wanted and advised him to return to Iraq. 3. Chassib replied that he had written to the Governor General to allow him to settle in his native country and to restore his land. His intentions were peaceable but he would fight to the ena rather than return to Iraq, His Majesty’s Consul saw at least 200 quite well armed Arabs. The Governor General has not received letter but is sending message to Chassib offering^safe conduct to visit Governor General and discuss his affairs. If discussions are not satisfactory or if Chassib declines to come, Governor General hopes to settle the matter by withdrawing troons from Bakhtiari country and using force. 4.

He maintained however tnat his sole object had been to encourage the Arabs in their support of the British and that he himself was too old to try to regain his fathers position or return to Lhuzistan. He said that he would like to see the Arabs of Khuzistan freed from Iranian oppression but that he had expressly told the Shaikhs not to ask for the reinstatement ? is famll y- In support of his statements he produced copies of his pamphlets and of the letter he had written to the Shaikhs, which I enclose in translation and original. was pointed out to Shaikh Chassib that however disinterested and pro-British he might consider his activities, they in ac* constituted an interference In Iranian politics which could not be tolerated, and that unless he abandoned his intrigues in Khuzistan he would incur the displeasure of His Majesty s Government. He assured me that his only desire had been to serve the British cause and that he v, ould immediately break off all relations with the Arab leaders in Khuzistan and take care in future to consult the British authorities before taking any action. He promised moreover that he would make no attempt to enter Iran without the permission of the British authorities, and his brothers have ail made similar promises. v*. w , No reiiance can be placed in Chassib’s assurances it is to be hoped that he is now convinced thatpfurther intrigues will not be to his advantage.

You know that this Government was our Ally in the past and has always our good in view, I, therefore, advise you my brothers to help our Ally the British and to sacrifice our lives and properties for their victory and honour, and I warn you to be careful not to be deceived by the plots of the intriguers, their enemies. I trust you will not fail me in what I think of you my brothers. May God help you.

Your Excellency, our interests are the same as yours at the present juncture, and as we are from among the Arabs who have been given a definite promise for the safeguard of their rights, we join them and approach you for the purpose. We complain to you because we had independence and freedom and we never paid any taxes, nor did we yield to the Iranian CrOYejmment. We yielded only to our own Heads of Tribes and took orders from them and they were-.

ELDEST SOD OF THE LATE SHAIKH OF MOKAMMERAH, Since the entry of British troops into Persia, reports have been received that Shaikh Chassib is endeavouring to stir up the tribes in the south uith a view to restoring the past position of the family. 2. Briefly, Chassib caused pamphlets to be distributed which purported to demand the assistance of the Arabs of Khuzistan for the British against their Persian masters. Since then he is reported to be sending agents from Basra to Persia and to be instigating the local shaikhs. His plan is that they should combine in requesting the reinstalling of the family in Persia. According to His Majesty’s Vice Consul at Khorramshahr, he (the consul) is receiving a great number of petitions from shaikhs on these lines. 3. It is, of course, natural that the family should hope for re—instalment, and it should be noted that three sons, Shaikh f Abd al Karim, Shaikh Abd al Majid and Shaikh ’Abdullah have dissociated themselves from this intrigue but have written p.A. offering their service in any capacity 4. His Majesty’s Government have made an acceptable settlement of their obligations to the late Shaikh and the last thing we require now in Khuzistan is a renewal of the matter. It is realised that Shaikh Chassib is without funds and is a man of no prestige, nevertheless it is suggested that His Majesty’s Ambassador be approached with a view to pressure being brought to bear on Shaikh Chassib to desist from intriguing which can only result in trouble for himself and for those persons who associate themselves with him. The entry of himself or any of his family into Persia should be definitely forbidden. (Signed) A.C. GALLO*AY. For Major-General Commanding 8th Indian Division.

The substance of this guarantee was that if the Shaikh cooperated with the Amir of Najd and the Shaikh of Kuwait in the capture of Basra from the Ottoman Turks, then the Shaikh and his male descendants would be supported against encroachment on his jurisdiction from the Persian government, whether it be royalist or nationalist. Furthermore, his date gardens on the Turkish side of the Shatt al-Arab would remain in the possession of the Shaikh and his heirs and exempt from taxation in perpetuity.Further discussion surrounds the establishment of the genuineness of the letter, as well as the implications for the British government of admitting this claim for protection and what measures could be taken to enforce it. Also discussed is the attempt by the Shaikh to foment rebellion against the Persian Government in Khuzistan and the measures taken by the Iraqi Government to stop this.The principal correspondents in the file include the Political Agent, Kuwait (Major Maurice O'Connor Tandy); the Secretary of State for India, London; HM Ambassador, Tehran; HM Ambassador, Baghdad; and the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The file include two dividers, which give a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
