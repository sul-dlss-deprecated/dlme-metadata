ITS PUBLIC CONVENIENCE, ITS CAPITAL, ITS TRAFFIC, ITS DIVIDENDS. B y VERITAS. L LONDON: EFFINGHAM WILSON, EOYAL EXCHANGE. 1868. Sixpence.the lltdwpxrlitan UaHfoag. ITS PUBLIC CONVENIENCE. O p all the marvels of which the City of London can boast, perhaps the greatest is the Metbo- politan Bail way , familiarly known to the million as the ' Underground.' Although projected some fifteen years back, the scheme was derided at the time as visionary and impracticable; the idea of its feasibility only gradually assumed shape, but for the want of the necessary funds, the project was for some years allowed to slumber. The Corporation of London at last, recognising the utility of a Eailway through the heart of London in relieving the ever- increasing traffic, gave its support both pecuniarily and influentially to the construction of the line.The Capital was subscribed, the engineering difficulties were overcome, and the original line of 3| miles opened for traffic five years back, and later a further | of a mile was completed. In a few months the Western Extension Line will be finished, and then 10 miles of Railway will be open to the public. Nothing can exceed the popular favour this line has received from the first day of its opening. Where the shoals of passengers come from, who have occupied the line in an increasing ratio ever since, it would seem impossible to calculate, as the omnibus and carriage traffic do not seem to have decreased. The public appreciate and greedily avail them selves of a speedy and comparatively luxurious mode of conveyance, passing through the densest quarters of the metropolis. What amount of Capital has been raised and expended upon this undertaking ? According to the published accounts submitted to the Share holders on 5th February, 1868, the Capital actually raised stands as follows :—5 ITS CAPITAL. £ £ Consolidated Capital .. .. 1,800,000 .. 1,799,977 £5 per cent. Preference Capital.. 300,000 .. 300,000 Extension Share Capital .. .. 1,900,000 .. 1,899,320 New Redeemable Share Capital. 600,000 .. 313,615 Let it be assumed that on or about the 1st May, 1868, the Contractors will deliver up the Extension Lines to the Eailway Company, and that the above amount will have been 'aii / expended, the Contractors paid in full, and no more Capital required, and that the interest and dividends upon ^65,425,620 must in future come exclusively from the Annual Kevenue of this Eailway. Under these circumstances the import ant considerations for the Shareholders are, what amount of traffic is necessary to give them dividends, and will these dividends increase or decrease ?

According to the General Manager s Report, included in the Report of the Directors submitted to the Shareholders at their Half-yearly Meeting, 5th February, 1868, the number of passengers conveyed, and the amount of traffic receipts, in each year since the opening of the line have been as follows:— Paseengera. Gross Ecceipts, Net Receipts. 1863 .... 9,455,175 ..£101,707 ..£56,537 1864 .... 11,721,889 ., 116,489 .. 70,776 1865 .... 15,763,907 .. 141,513 .. 86,008 1866 .... 21,273,104 210,242 .. 125,683 1867 .... 23,405,282 .. 233,180 .. 143,109 81,619,357 ..£803,131 .,£482,113 thus showing a continual annual increase. The following table will show the number of passengers required to earn the different amounts enumerated:—Passengers, Groee Revenue. 101^ are required to earn £1 1,015 £10 10,150 £100 101,500 £1,000 1,015,000 V £10,000 10,150,000 &gt;&gt; £100,000 81,200,01)0 }} £800,000 304,500 M 3,000 30,450 7) 300 81,534,950 £803,300 as against 81,619,357, earning in the 5 years ^803,131, as per the General Manager's Keport. It will thus be seen that the above calculation of 101|- passengers (under twopence halfpenny each passenger) to produce ^1 gross revenue is under-estimated.

According to the ' Eailway Accounts,' as given by Mr. H. E. Bird, Accountant, in his Compre hensive Analysis of the Capital and Revenue of the Railways of the United Kingdom, the income from these sources to the Metropolitan Railway Company, for the year ending 30th June, 1867, is set down as £'22,159, which gives a little more £ Ext.

The working expenses in the above estimates are set down at 37 per cent, only, thus following the author of the '15 per cent. Metropolitan paying Line.' The interest upon the Debentures is taken at 4^ per cent, per annum. No provision is made for the interest upon the New Eedeemable Share Capital (£600,000) already raised, £313,615, as it is presumed there will be ample funds from the rents of the surplus lands to cover such interest. SUEPLUS LANDS. Various estimates have been given to the Direc tors as to the value of this property. The Chairman of the Metropolitan Eailway, in his address to the Shareholders on the 5th February, 1868, stated, ' The Surplus Lands were valued at £1,300,000, and if they had strength to retain them until they could sell them in a proper manner, he believed they would produce a sum greatly in excess of12 that amount.' This is very well in theory, but it would be far more satisfactory to the Share holders to be informed from time to time that ' a part of the Surplus Lands, &amp;c., has been sold for £10,000, and we have paid otf Debentures to that amount.' At the Meeting of Shareholders on 5tli Feb ruary, 1868, authority was given to raise a further £200,000 by Debentures. To cover the interest upon this amount, say 5 per cent., £10,000, an additional traffic of 1,700,000 passengers are re quired ! This additional Capital is not taken into account in the above tables. In fact, the Capital account is only treated as consisting of— Consolidated Capital .. £1,800,000 £5 p. c. Preference Capital 300,000 Extension Share Capital . 1,900,000 Debenture Capital .. 1,331,323 at 4| p. c. per annum Temporary Loans .. 95,000 at 5 p. c. per annum &lt;£5,426,323 What the actual amount of Capital will be when the Va estern Extension Line is completed, the Contractors paid in full, the several claimants13 for lands and houses on the Western Extension, as well as the Eastern Extension (the latter line abandoned for the present, although heavy claims on the Railway Company for houses and land on the once-intended line have still to be settled) are satisfied, can at present be known only to those behind the scenes. It is a mistake that the Metropolitan Railway Company did not confine the line to 4^ miles originally made and opened. The traffic upon such line must have always been sufficient to give large dividends. It is, however, no use crying over spilt milk, but it must be a most grave question for all interested in this useful enterprise to consider whether they had not better let bad alone, and not ruin altogether the undertaking by making any further Extensions. Let the Directors rather turn their attention to dispose of the surplus land and houses. Every ££100,000 obtained for such property, if appro priated to paying off a similar sum of borrowed money, will save so much interest, which interest will, of course, be applicable to dividends.14 The Shareholders should strenuously fight against any further expenditure, and watch nar rowly the weekly returns from passenger trafSc j when this amounts to =£10,000 per week, instead of, as at present, under c£4 5 500, the Shareholders may calculate on receiying the old dividends of 7 per cent, per annum upon il,800,000, and 6 per cent, upon ^1,900,000. Taking into consideration the increased sup posed traffic, the wear and tear to the permanent way will be more severe, and, therefore, 37 per cent, for working expenses is far too little, and the increase of working expenses must necessarily reduce the amount disposable for dividends. For the year ending the 31st of December, 1867, the working expenses, as per General- Manager's Report, were as nearly as possible 39 per cent. GOODS. A great deal has been said of the large revenue to be derived from this source, but it is a question whether any pecuniary advantages by the transit15 of goods, upon such a short line, will not be swal lowed up by the expenses at both ends for station accommodation, and extra labour, and also by the increased wear and tear to the permanent way. Any net profit, however, will, of course, help to swell the dividends. A net weekly amount of .£4,904 is required to provide for £ £ Preference Capital .. 300,000 at 5 p. c. per annum 15,000 Consolidated Stock .. 1,800,000 at 7 p. c. per annum 126,000 Extension Share Capital 1,900,000 at 6 p. c. per annum 114,000 /Working Expenses will give £510,000 gross An- Interest on Debenture Capital nual Revenue, to cover Interest on Temporary Loans which, calculating only 50 s a further weekly amount of traffic, ^4,904, would be required, say together ^9,808 per week gross revenue. This latter calculation of 50 per cent, is under rated rather than overrated. Could the Capital of this Eailway be reduced, or the average fares on the line be raised, the Doubling this amount £255,000 per cent, for Compensation Cases, dc..mam ■■bbhbrbhhhhbp 16 late dividends might be maintained ; but, as both these suppositions are impossible, the Share holders must put up with such dividends as the present state of things will give. Let them, however, shut their pockets against any further extension of the line until, at all even , a 4 per cent, dividend be fairly earned. JY68 EpFiHanAM W il 6 oh , Royal Exchange.The Plan for the separatiou of the Capital of a Railway from the Revenue, wliicj will he found in the following pages, was tir^t propounded in a speech delivered ut a meeting of the Shareholders of the London and North-Western Company, in August, 1858. It afterwards appeared, at the request of tlie Editor of the Man- diester Guardian, in that paper; and the very general approval which the proposal elicited induced me to put it into a more permanent form, and in December, 1858, I published a small edition of a pamphlet, entitled ' Railway Management, embodying my views of the evil tendencies of the existing system, and setting forth the plan by which I proposed to remove one cause of doubt and suspicion, by securing a total and palpable separation of Capital from Revenue, The period of time which has since elapsed has furnished ample proof, if such were wanting, that there is something inherently vicious in the system, that defies all attempts of the Shareholders to control the expenditure, or to secure the Capital from misappropriation, and which is destructive of ah confidence in Railway pro perty as a source of safe aud profitable investment. The experience which we have had during the interval has tended only to strengthen my convictions of the necessity and practicability of the plan I pro pose as a remedy for one of the evils under which Railway property is suffering: and the strength of those convictions, combined with the imperative necessities of the case, must be my apology for again bringing the subject under the notice of Railway Shareholders. THOS. WRIGLEY. niel,RAILWAY REFORM. The rosmoN ot Britisli Railways nas for soin© tim© bGGii a subject of considerable anxiety to tliose more inirnediiately interested, so much, so as to have excited the sympathy of the non-shareholding public, and to furnish a topic of discussion for the 1 ress in general. It is lelt by everyone as something almost unaccountable, that Railway undertakings, being bound up with the commerce and industry of the country, and having tended so greatly to promote the general prosperity, should be themselves excluded from the benefits arising therefrom. It is a notable fact, that in proportion as the Railway system has been extended, so have the dividends declined, and the property become depreciated in value. In the early stages of railways, and until the demon of territorial aggrandisement took possession of every Railway Board, they did make a satis factory return to their proprietors. The Manchester and Liver pool, the Grand Junction, the London and Birmingham, the Manchester and Leeds, all, so long as they preserved their in dividuality, paid good dividends, and were eminently success- THh - ftd as commercial enterprises. But from the time that these lines became merged in the general and more imposing titles of London and North-Western, Lancashire and Yorkshire, the Great Northern, the Midland, the North British, the Caledo nian, &amp;e., we find that.they have become of less value to the proprietors as a remunerative investment. In 1858, at a period of depression somewhat similar to that which is now creating a panic among Railway Shareholders, I published a pamphlet under the title of ' Railway Management.'6 E AIL WAY REFORM. It was addressed more immediately to the Shareholders of the London and North-Wcstem Railway, but being apropos to the present time, I shall quote a passage or two as showing that what we are now suffering is but an aggravation of a disorder of lon^ standing, and on that account demands something more than the ordinary treatment, if we are to eradicate the disease, Referring to the condition of the railway interest, I said :— «&lt; i t j 3 nnw twenty-six years since the Liverpool and Manchester Railway first hurst npon the world as the herald of a new system of locomotion, which at once established its superiority over all competitors. Are we to conclude that this was the commencement of inevitable misfortune—that the making of railways, as a means for the profitable invesimerit of capital, was a mistake, and that the present lamentable condition of railway property is the result of causes inherent in the system? Are we to contemplate the process of depreciation which has 1)een steadily progressing, concurrently with the extension of this means of locomotion, as an evidence of what we are to expect in the fuhire, until our property is sur rendered into the hands of directors and officials—as a means only of furnishing extravagant salaries to those engaged in its management?' Nine years have elapsed since these words were penned. The three hundred millions which had then been absorbed by rail ways have now become five hundred millions, and the prospect before us is even worse than it was at the time to which I have referred; for dividends have not only declined, but in many cases they are, so far as the original Shareholder are con cerned, annihilated; and in consequence of the fraudulent pro ceedings which have recently come to light, the whole system is discredited and demoralised. Such a state of things is not only injurious to those who have supplied the means to create these great national works, but it is a misfortune to the country that so large an amount of capital should be rendered unproductive, and to those who have been entrusted with the government and management of these undertakings it is to the last degree discreditable. There is no reason, as iar as I can see, why railways in this prosperous and enterprising country should not have been among the first, the best, and the safest investments in the kingdom, W ith a constantly increasing revenue, arising from a con stant ;y expanding traffic, there ought to be neither doubt nor ditnculty in securing a balance of revenue sufficient to satisfy.RAILWAY EEFOEM. 7 the very reasonable expectations of the Shareholders, and it is therefore all the more mortifying to feel that the present condi tion of things has been brought about by a want of judgment, and I fear in many cases a want of principle, on the part of those whose duty it was to remember that they were entrusted with the property of others on the faith that it would bo honestly administered in their interest and for their benefit. Matters have now arrived at a point where it is absolutely incumbent on the Shareholders to interfere, if they desire to save their property from extinction. It must be admitted that a system which after thirty-five years' trial, under circumstances most favourable to its success, has produced no better result than what we see, must be pronounced a failure; and we are forced to the conclusion either that railways must be abandoned as an investment for capital, or there is something inherently vicious in the system and the principle on which they are governed, that requires an immediate remedy. In the interest of the public it is important that this question should receive an early solution; for although there has been a very considerable and in many cases a very unwise extension of railways, still it is not to be supposed that we have arrived at the limit of railway accommodation that may be necessary for the public requirements ; and unless these undertakings can be placed upon a footing whereby the capital invested will make a reasonable return, the only alternative is for the public to make their own railways, through the Government; and, looking at the way in which Government work is done—as illustrated in the Dockyards, the Post Office, and wherever the State steps out of its proper province, viz. governing—the public would have little reason to congratulate themselves upon the change. All that is wanted to make railways successful commercial under takings, is that they should adopt the principles and follow the practices of ordinary business, instead of apemg the follies and the vices that characterise all Government management. An extension of the railway system is an inevitable neces sity of the future, and I am convinced that such extension as may be necessary for the public convenience need not and ought8 RAILWAY EEFOEM. not to entail any sacrifice to the present holders of railway property. On the contrary, the experience of all commercial undertakings shows that the extension of a business already profitable ought to increase rather than diminish the profitable result, for th j reason that the fixed charges, which belong to all concerns, become less burdensome when spread over a larger surface. All depends on the judgment exercised in their pro jection, the care and economy in their execution, and the energy and practical business principles which are brought to bear in the working management. Shareholders are, however, obtaining a little light from past experience, although it has been purchased at a great sacrifice. They see that the traffic and the fevenue continue steadily to increase, but they see also that the demands upon it increase in a far greater ratio. This is the peculiar feature which has marked the course of railway enterprise, and which is now at tracting the attention of ail who feel an interest in the subject. The demands which press so severely on the earnings of the railway do not arise in any great degree from the excessive cost oi working the traffic. The percentage of working expenses is pretty well established; and although there is much room for improvement in this respect, it is not here at this moment that I would direct the attention of the Shareholders. » ^ ear by year the capital account goes on increasing in bulk. There appears to be no limit to its power of expansion. Every } ear \\ e see London occupied by a host of lawyers, engineers, directors, and officials, who are living at the best hotels, and holding their annual saturnalia at the expense of the Share- hulders ail intent upon adding to this huge mass, without tipptucntly one thought as to its effect upon those whose funds they are squandering. lu order to give the reader some idea of the magnitude of these operations, I beg to refer him to a list of upwards of twenty railways, published by Messrs. Whitehead and Coles, of ondon, shouing the increase ol capital on these lines during the space of one year, ending June, 1867. Out of this list I have selected nine railways that in the aggregate have, in theBess ak railway reform. 9 short space of twelve months, added little short of twenty-five millions to Capital Account. Nor is this mania for Capital expenditure at all confined to what are called the ' delinquent' companies. The London and North-Western—one of the most respectably conducted railways in the kingdom—figures in the list as having added in twelve months £3,865,000 to Capital. Five years ago, when the dividend of this railway had run down to 3| per cent., an Association of Shareholders endea voured to put a stop to the continued increase of the Capital Account, and they succeeded so far as to induce the Directors to promise that with the completion of the work in hand the expenditure should cease. But notwithstanding this, we find that during the five years ending June 30, 1867, the Capital Account of the London and North-Western has been increased £11,500,000, of which £7,500,000 has been added in the last two years. If a company of this standing and position sets an example of this nature, we need not be surprised if others in a more questionable position follow the example. We have another instance in the Midland—a railway equal in point of position, and governed by men of undoubted character and respectability. This railway has, in the space of one year, ending June, 1867, added to its Capital Account the sum of £3,282,867 ; and notwithstanding this, the Directors have just issued a circular to the Shareholders intimating their intention to levy a further contribution upon them of £5,000,000 ; and this upon no better plea than that the expenditure has so far exceeded the estimates. It is difficult to believe that this discrepancy can have arisen from a mere blunder in the estimates, and not less difficult to understand how, in the execution of work already provided for, such an enormous excess of expenditure can have accrued. But be this as it may, it is scarcely worth the trouble of estimating at all where such a discrepancy is possible; and there can be no doubt that in whatever way the Directors have managed so far to deceive themselves and the Shareholders, they have fur nished abundant proof of their incapacity to conduct a great c10 RAILWAY REFOEM. undertaking such as that they have in charge, and are therefore unfit for the position they occupy. It is one of the worst features of the Railway system that we can place no reliance upon any statement, whether of facts or figures, issued by a Railway Board. These statements are not prepared with any intention that the Shareholders should have a full knowledge of the condition of their property, or be able to form a correct judgment as to its value. If there is not a settled purpose to deceive, there is at least an intention to withhold the truth. The time, however, comes—however long it may have been kept at bay, come it must—when the real truth must be told. The incessant demands upon the Share holders having failed to meet with a response, then begins the process of financing. Money must be raised on any terms: preference shares are piled tier above tier; the rents for leased and guaranteed lines must be paid; and the only legitimate source for meeting these engagements is the Revenue. After a time we arrive at another stage, when the Revenue is insufficient, to meet i ne demands upon it, and yet leave a satisfactory divi dend lor the original shareholders. Under such circumstances the temptation to wrongdoing is strong; and there is unfor tunately no room to doubt that, under the pressure of diffi culties which a lavish expenditure has brought upon them, the Directors have in many cases appropriated Capital to Revenue purposes. In plain language, they have paid dividends out of Capital. I he Capital Account, then, to the exclusion of every other minor matter, ought to receive the undivided attention of the S laroholflers. It is here where the money is absorbed that should accrue for dividend; and my conviction is that, unless this con tinuous and lavish expenditure can be brought under control- unless the money raised for purposes of Capital can be secured against its fraudulent application to Revenue purposes—Rail ways must and ought to be shunned by all prudent people, and proscribed as an investment for their successors; thev mu.-t I k - leit to the speculators and gamblers of the StockEAILWAY REFORM. 11 This, then, is what we have to do. The question is, how to do it? The nature of the disease is rightly divined, but in my opinion the remedies proposed fall very far short of what is necessary to effect a cure. Shareholders are enjoined to select a better class of Directors—honest men, business men, practical men. Then it is said. Directors should be paid, and their numbers reduced. Shareholders are called upon to exercise a more vigilant control over the Directors. And, lastly, a more efficient audit should be established. Those who put forward these suggestions can have but a very imperfect knowledge of the relative position of the Shareholders to the Directors—of the power which the latter wield—of the comparative helplessness of the former, xis to the election of Directors, except under extraordinary circumstances, they are as a rule self-elected; for notwithstanding the legal form which is observed, the Shareholders have really no voice in the matter. The organised proxy power with which the Directors are con stantly armed by their friends and connections, and the unre flecting portion of the Proprietors, is sufficient to override and crush the unorganised efforts of the Shareholders; nor is it possible to bring their power into a focus so as to giv T e any hope of success, except at a cost of labour, time, and money, which few are disposed to incur. The apparent supineness and indifference exhibited by Shareholders is in reality produced by a conscious ness of their inability to do any good; and so long as the law remains in its present shape. Directors will remain masters of the situation. As to the payment of Directors, with a view to securing a more close and constant attention to the Company's affairs, it would be well to inquire if the object in view is likely to be achieved by such means. On this subject I cannot do better than quote a passage from my former pamphlet ' Whatever we have to do, we should have Regard to the fitness of things. There are certain conditions essential to the due performance of a task, without which there must be failure. Time and opportunity, ability and aptitude for business.12 RAILWAY EEFORM. coupled with a knowledge based upon experience, are essential to success in any occupation of life. ' Now I would ask—Have we these elements, or anything approaching to them, in the constitution of a Board of Directors ? Are they selected with any regard to their fitness to enter upon the duties of managing a great undertaking such as a railway ? Have they the abilities and the necessary knowledge ? Have tlioy the time and opportunity, even if they had the power and disposition? The truth is, that the very principle (if the term be not altogether misapplied) upon which Directors are appointed, gives nn security whatever that they possess the qualifica tions to which I have before alluded, and without which their interference in the detail management cannot be otherwise than injurious. ' One is appointed because he has a large stake; another because he is an M .P., with a view to parliamentary influence. Then we have the retired merchant, or successful manufacturer, having spent their best energies in achieving an inde pendence. Next we have bankers, barristers, a country squire, a sprinkling of naval and military officers; and for purposes of decoration we must have two or three members of the aristocracy. With materials such as these, drawn together by accident, no organization on earth can make it other than what it is—a carica ture on business management.' A Board of Directors composed of sucli heterogeneous mate rials is not, in my opinion, a body on whom the Shareholders ought to rely lor the active duties of management. Nor am I ai all ''ontldent that if the Shareholders exercised a free choice in their selection the result would be materially different. Let tliom be elected how they may, they are not and never can be servants in the sense in which servitude is required for the interests of the Company. They claim to be masters of their time, to do as much or as little as suits their personal con- vemence or their other engagements. I concur most entirely with those who lay it down as a principle that every one neces- sary to the effective management and working of a railway ion Id be paid for his services; but as a condition of this pay- ment I ghouM stipulate that the whole time, thought, and ^ ^ r ( 1Sons so employed should be devoted exclusively to the duties assigned to them. Such a condition would, ^ a tVZ 01 a C0 ' T ' ex ''! ndc the cIa8e of gentlemen chosen as Di- j- ' la ' a ) s 'oi'id 1*'so manned in every department, 1 r t0 P t0 the with a well-selected and well- paid o ass of servants, to whom the emolument they receive is that / T retaimDg by 110,1684 and feitWU 'sorvico; so 0 businm management and working of the railwayE AIL WAY EEFOEM. 13 would iu no degree be dependent on the personal attention of Directors. I by no means wish it to be understood that I undervalue or wish to dispense with the services of the Directors. In their proper place as a governing body they are essential; as super visors and protectors of the interests of the Shareholders there is an ample field for effort. All that I aim at is to bring the duties of Directors within the limits of the time and means at their disposal; to relieve them from duties which they cannot effectually perform, in order that they may the better fulfill those that are within the scope of their time and opportunities. And in limiting their duties to the appointment of efficient officers, the supervision of their proceedings, and a periodical examina tion and comparison of results, I feel sure that I am exacting all that they can usefully perform—all that it is possible for gentle men occupying independent positions and having other occu pations to fulfill. As to the Audit, as at present practised it is utterly worthless —nay, it is far worse, for it tends to induce the Shareholders to rely upon it as a protection against wrongdoing; and so far it is a delusion and a snare. Whether any better plan can be devised remains to be seen. If it can, there is undoubtedly need of it. But of this I am satisfied—that the evil under which railways have so long suffered, and which is now pressing upon them with a severity that threatens disaster, will not be eradicated by remedial measures of this character. It is but repairing the structure when the foundations are known to be rotten and unsound. It will require the united efforts of the Shareholders, with all the resolution and determination they can bring to bear, to effect any reform whatever. It is therefore desirable that their efforts should not be frittered away on trivialities, but that they should be directed against what is generally admitted to be the main grievance, viz. the Capital Account. On this point there is no difference of opinion outside a Railway Board-room. The Revenue is ample, and, in fact, far exceeds all reasonable expec tations ; but no amount of Revenue appears to be sufficient tommmmmmmmmmmmmrnrnmu RAILWAY REFORM. satisfy the insatiable appetite of the Capital Account. For years past the Shareholders have made spasmodic efforts to correct this evil. ' The Capital Account must be closed,' has been the often-repeated demand, and as often have the Direc tors promised compliance with their wishes. But no sooner does the Eevenue exhibit signs of buoyancy, from the ever-expanding resources of the country, than the mania for extension, like an epidemic, again returns, and instead of an increase of dividend the Directors point to the amount of unproductive capital which, when brought into useful operation, will realise all their hopes. The means that have heretofore been adopted to stop this expenditure have altogether failed, and the sooner the Share holders abandon all hope of doing any good by such means the better for their interests. It is hopeless to expect that this will ever be done by the voluntary act of the Directors, and equally hopeless and visionary to look to the Shareholders as a controlling power. The former are endowed with a power which they never ought to have possessed; the latter have the shadow without the substance. The fundamental error consists in allowing those who are charged with the working of the Railway for lie venue purposes to exercise any power or control over the expenditure of Capital. So long as the Capital and the power to raise Capital are in the hands of those who are in charge of the Revenue department, no power which the Shareholders can exercise will be sufficient to stop the current of expenditure, or secure the money raided on &lt; apital Account from being applied to illegitimate purposes. hat is wanted is not only a cessation of improvident expen diture, but confidence on the part of the Shareholders that those who are entrusted with the Capital are under no temptation to expend it unwisely, or to appropriate it dishonestly. This confidence can never be established, the expenditure on Capital Account can never be brought under due control, so long as the powei to receive and expend Capital is in the hands of those a\1io are entrusted with the working management, and who are therefore responsible to the Shareholders for a dividend. llierc will always be new projects in view of one sort ore ail way eefoem. 15 another. A branch is required to complete the system, or to anticipate the invasion of their territory by some rival Com pany ; increased station accommodation; an addition to the Railway Stock;—any or all of which may be at some time necessary, but so long as the Directors are invested with autho rity to expend Capital, and are made judges in their own case in deciding between the conflicting interests of Capital and Eevenue, their proceedings will always be open to doubt and suspicion. They are under great temptation to have some ex^ penditure going on on Capital Account. It is very convenient to have two accounts open, to be able to dispose of an awkward item, that if charged against Revenue would make a perceptible inroad into the dividend. Without a Capital Account there would no longer be any necessity for that difficult and delicate financial analysis, by which Capital is supposed to be separated from Revenue, but which commonly results in relieving Revenue at the expense of Capital; nor would there be any opportunity for the display of that official ingenuity by which Railway Accounts, which ought to be the very essence of simplicity, are rendered utterly un intelligible to people of ordinary arithmetical acquirements. Again, I say, there will be no security against improvident expenditure of Capital, nor against its mal-appropriation, so long as the key of the box (so to speak) containing the Capital money is in the hands of those who are responsible to the Shareholders for a dividend. No system of auditing that I can conceive— whether by public accountant or by Government—will be effective. The temptation is too strong to withstand under circumstances of difficulty, of threatened competition, or in the face of a dividend that shows signs of weakness; and the only remedy I can suggest is a very simple one—take the box away. The principle for which I contend, and which I desire to see established on Railways, is no novelty; it is as old as the hills, and is found in universal operation throughout all civilised society. I desire only to establish the same relations as between the Capital of a Railway and the Revenue department that exist between the owners and occupiers of property, i here is16 RAILWAY EEFOKM. a natural sympathy, and to a certain extent a mutual interest, between landlord and tenant; but the landlord finds it necessary to keep control of his property, and he allows his tenant to occupy it on certain conditions—the object being to keep the two interests distinct, and to preserve the property from waste. If we require an example of the beneficial influence of holding the Capital of a Eailway distinct from the Eevenue, we have it in the Indian Kail ways, where the Government holds a strict control over the Capital expenditure. I propose, therefore, that the Directors for Eevenue shall be deprived of all power or control over the Capital Account, and that their duties shall be exclusively confined to the one object of working the traffic to the best advantage, in order to raise a dividend for the Shareholders. The effect of this exclusive attention to the working management would doubtless promote economy in the working, and a better adaptation of the facilities which the Eailway offers for the convenience and requirements of the puulic; and I doubt not that after a time, being thus thrown upon their own resources, they will discover the neces sity of adopting the principle of sectional or divisional manage- ment so universally practised in all well-conducted private concerns. With no funds at their disposal but those arising from Levenue, there would be no longer any risk of a mixture with Capital. ^ The Directors would disburse from the Eevenue funds all that was necessary for the efficient working of the traffic, and the balance would be fairly and honestly earned, and applicable to t j ic purpose ol dividend. The accounts which would be presented by the Eevenue Directors would assume a very simple form, quite within the capacity of anyone acquainted Mini figures to understand; and assuming that the working department had been conducted economically, the disposable balance, whatever it was, would be all that the Shareholders would be entitled to. As regards the Capital Account, I propose to place it under 16 c iai fc c 0 ' tl i&gt;oard ot J rustees, who would be excluded from ail connection or interference with the Eevenue department;eatlway eefoem. 17 these Trustees to have entire charge and control of the Com pany's estate in lands, works, and rolling stock; to raise and disburse all money on Capital Account; and to be responsible for the maintenance and repair of railway works and buildino^ permanent way, and rolling stock. For a more minute descrip tion of the duties of the Directors and the Trustees respectively, I refer the reader to a synoptical plan which will be found attached. It will therefore be unnecessary for me to enter here into further detail. The position which the Trustees would occupy would be 4 simply conservators of the property. They would have no motive to induce them to expend anything on Capital Account beyond what was necessary to facilitate the operations of the Company. One advantage that would result from this absolute and complete separation of Capital from Revenue would be, that it would render unnecessary that extreme measure which has so often been proposed but never acted upon, viz. a closed Capital Account. Much as I sympathise with those who, in their desire to put an end to the ceaseless expenditure of Capital, have adopted this as a remedy, I have never been able to satisfy myself that it was practicable; or, if so, that it would be equitable in its effect upon a fleeting body of Shareholders. It is quite im possible to stop expenditure in connection with an increasing business, and the effect of a closed Capital Account, in its literal sense, would be to tax the Revenue for such expenditure unjustly. I freely confess that, rather than permit the present system to continue, I would adopt that of a closed Capital Account, as the least of two evils. What is meant by the phrase is, 1 apprehend, that there shall be an end of new projects—a cessation of expenditure except what is necessary to enable the Company to conduct its business efficiently, and to provide for the public accommodation so far as is compatible with a due regard to the interests of the Shareholders. And, further, that there shall be no possibility of a continuance of the practice of relieving Revenue at the expense of Capital. By the plan I propose, of depriving the Directors for RevenueRAILWAY KEFORM. of all power to expend Capital, and placing Capital in the care of a body who could have no motive to commit a breach of their trust, but who at the same time would be in a position to provide what was necessary to improve the property, I think the Shareholders would obtain all the security they can reasonably Let it be clearly understood that by the plan I propose I do not contemplate a mere division of an existing Board of Directors into committees for Capital and Jievenue. I should repudiate any proposition of this nature as failing altogether to realise what I have in view. What 1 want to see established is not a theoretical division, but an actual taking away of the Capital, and placing it under the control of a distinct body of men—a complete severance of power and authority, with no mixture of responsibility as between Capital and Revenue. This separation would not involve anything of the nature of antagonism between the Directors and Trustees. The latter, being Shareholders with a higher qualification than is usual, would naturally feel an interest in and do all in their power to facilitate the operations of the Directors. What was necessary to the success of their operations the Trustees would be ready to supply ; tor in doing so they would not only be tending to a rosult in which they had a common interest, but they would be adding to the value of the property. J here aio other topics to which I might draw the attention of Shareholders, and loremost among them is the power of raising money by loans, or preference shares, which the Directors possess, and which they exercise greatly to the prejudice of the original Proprietors. But I prefer to test the feeling of the Shareholders upon this one vital question—the separation of Capital from Eevenue—and I ask them to give to the plan I have suggested a calm and deliberate consideration.

LORD ALMONER'S PKOFESSOR OP ARABIC IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, AND OF LINCOLN'S INN, BAURISTEU-AT-LAW. LONDON: ROBERT IIAEDWICKE, 192 PICCADILLY, 1869. Price One Shilling.n SUGGESTIONS FOR A RAILWAY ROUTE TO INDIA. Within the last few years railway communication has been developed throughout the world to an extent which has sur passed the expectations of the most sanguine. The effect upon national character, and upon human society and intercourse, can hardly as yet be fully understood; but it is certain that the barriers, whether geographical or political, which at pre sent divide the nations of the earth, will have fallen before the present generation has passed away, and that there will be more or less a fusion not only of the races of Christendom but of those which at present are looked upon as beyond the pale of civilisation. It is the purpose of the present Essay to consider the position of the British Government and people with regard to this great movement; to inquire how far our interests command us to look beyond the limits of these islands and even of their dependencies, and advance railway communication between England and India as a matter ot public policy. I shall begin by recapitulating some of the most extraordinary achievements of railway enterprise in the present day, since both in their conception and details they may fur nish us with a guide in our own efforts. I hey indicate the course which the world's traffic is taking, and if properly studied they show how the mistakes which have lessened the usefulness and profitableness ot former undertakings may be avoided. The history of some railways is an example, that of others is a warning; but viewing the subject as a whole there is sufficient proof that railways can be cheaply, rapidly, and efficiently constructed in most parts of the world. I he chief cause of pecuniary failure (fhe immense cost of the works), has arisen from the imitation in sparsely settled countries of the expensive and highly-finished construction usual m England. There is also the unfortunate fact that the inteiest^ of those actually engaged in the construction of railways a 24 SUGGESTIONS FOR have often been bv no means in accord with the interests of the shareholders. Both these obstacles to success may be, and under proper supervision would be, avoided; and we may take it for granted that means will be found for making railway communication general on A\hat may be called the great routes of the world. How far the movement has been already carried will be apparent from the following instances. The pre at event of the present year has been the comple tion of the line joining the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States. Such a work strikes the imagination when we merely hear that it has been accomplished; the interest and the surprise become greater when we learn the details. A few years ago the notion of carrying rails across the mountain ranges and the desert tracts of the region which lies between California and the Mississippi appeared visionary to ordinary speculators. That the work would be done some day, every one, of course, believed; but it was thought to be hardly a matter which concerned the present generation. Want of wood, want of water, a small population or none at all, to say nothing of Mormon jealousy and Indian hostilities, were obstacles that could only be surmounted by time. Then there was the grave question of pecuniary success. America is a growing country, and California is one of the most growing States of America. But would the traffic between California and the rest of the Union pay a railway company, even supposing the most rapid advance of population ? And, if not, would it be worth the while of the American Government to come to the assistance of private enterprise, and carry out the project? This last question, at least, has been answered in the affirma tive, and the Pacific railway is now complete. A few years ago it was said that such a communication was a superfluity, that it was not wanted, and would hardly be used by the pub lic. The lines of steamboats were excellently organised, and people could go by the isthmus with more comfort and with less expense than across the continent. The gain in time, it was said, would be balanced by the fatigue of a railway journey of such prodigious length, which would lay up the weakly pas sengers with illness, and compel all but the most robust to make several halts on the way. In fact, most of the argu ments were adduced which, as I shall show, are advanced against the scheme to which I am about to call attention. The enterprise of the American people and the patriotic spirit of Congress, which went to the extreme of liberality with the companies, made nought of these objections. In the year 1862 Congress authorised the construction of a railway from theA RAILWAY ROUTE TO INDIA. 5 Mississippi to the Pacific. Wisely considering that the work was too much for one company, and that competition would excite activity, it entrusted the undertaking to two companies, the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific. The former was to begin on the Californian side and work eastward from Sacramento City; the latter was to begin at Omaha City on the west bank of the Mississippi, near the junction of the Nebraska river, and work westward. Each company was to own and run all the road it could construct before the two sections met in the interior, and each was to receive a Govern ment endowment ranging from 16,000 to 48,000 dollars per mile, according to the nature of the country to be traversed. Nominally this was a loan. On the completion of every twenty miles of road bonds were to be issued for the amounts due; the Government taking as security a first mortgage on the line. For all freights and mails carried over the road Govern ment was to be charged the same as private individuals ; one half to be paid in cash, and the other reserved as a sink ing fund toward the extinction of the bonds. Such was the endowment, seemingly liberal enough, which Congress made at first for this great work; but liberal as it was it failed to attract capitalists, and Congress did not hesitate to offer still higher inducements. The people had made up their minds that the enterprise should succeed, and though in the midst of a tremendous war, costly beyond any in history, they deter mined to grant still more munificent terms. In 1864 Con gress changed the Government loan into a second mortgage, and authorised the companies to issue their own bonds to a similar amount as a first mortgage on the road. Capital was then quickly attracted, and the work commenced. As each company received the land along its line of rails up to the point where the lines should meet, each naturally worked with herculean energy to get over as much ground as possible. The consequence is, that in less than five years the work has been completed. It is said that the Central Pacific performed the incredible feat of laying ten miles of rails in a single day. It would have been impossible to devise a plan more calculated to insure rapidity in the execution; though, of course, it has naturally led to the slurring over or 6 scamping' a good deal of the work. But though the road will need much improvement, it is at any rate open, and from New York to San Francisco, a distance of more than 3,000 miles, one can travel on a con tinuous rail with a single ticket. The companies also claim that under their charter they were not bound to complete a first-class road before 1876; that they have actually given6 SUGGESTIONS FOE the public a road fairly serviceable in 1869, and can now devote themselves to improving it; which is a better plan than to construct slowly, so that everything may be done at once in first-rate style. . A recent writer has given his testimony to the practical efficiency of+he road, and the ease with which the journey can be made. Chicago, 910 miles from New York, is reached after 43 hours' travel. The distance from Chicago to Omaha, the initial point of the Pacific railroad, is 490 miles, and the cars of the Chicago and North Western railroad make the trip in 22 hours. At Laramie, 562 miles from Omaha, the Kocky Mountains are reached. The watershed of the Con tinent at Bridger's Pass is reached in two days and a half from Omaha, and thence all water runs Pacific-wards. Here comes magnificent scenery and correspondingly difficult engineering. In fact, the line is here a triumph of enterprise and construc tive skill, not only in the difficulties that have been sur mounted, but from the economy with which the work has been done. ' The journey through Weber and Echo Cannons or Passes is one of the most weird and frightful imaginable. The line winds along the side of deep chasms, over roaring torrents, under overhanging mountains, round towering cliffs, past wonders of Nature in her wildest moods, with beauties of mountain scenery unsurpassed probably anywhere.' At Pro montory mountain the junction of the lines of the two com panies is reached. Utah and Nevada are crossed, and finally the Sierra Nevada is attained. Here are the greatest diffi culties of the road. The summit of the Sierra is crossed at an altitude of 7,042 feet; this altitude is attained in a distance of 112 miles locomotive climbing, and the highest engineering science was therefore necessary in the construction. The journey to the ocean is now rapidly downward—so rapid, indeed, where there is a descent of 116 feet to the mile, that steam is altogether shut off, and the breaks partially applied. In 6| days from New York the traveller westward is set down at San Francisco; and in a short time, when close connexions and some improvements have been completed, the journey may be made in less than six days. The distance is at present 3,181 miles. With respect to the construction and efficiency for traffic, it is promised that in a year or two everything will be in perfect condition. Even at present the line between Omaha and Piedmont in Nevada, a distance of 930 miles, is said to be one of the best in the States, and such that the trains can make 40 miles an hour. The present average speed is 22A RAILWAY ROUTE TO INDIA. 7 miles, which will be largely increased when the improvements are completed. Here, then, is an instance of what well-directed enterprise can achieve in the present state of engineering science. A vast continent, all of it as yet thinly peopled, and the Western districts almost destitute of population, can be penetrated by a railway, of which the half is the work of less than five years. Two great ranges of mountains can be crossed, the road can be carried up and down the steepest inclines, to a height of more than 7,000 feet above the sea; desert plains can be traversed, all the labour required, and all the material, can be brought from the two extremities of the line to the desolate region between them, and finally the entire continent of America can be crossed at the rate of 500 miles a day. This is the latest and most splendid instance of railway enterprise, and of the patriotic aid given by a Government in a great national work; but it is not the only one which demands our approbation. The development of the resources of India by means of railways advances, if not with the desired rapidity, yet with regularity and certainty. I am happy to think that the present Governor-General, Lord Mayo, is con vinced of the necessity of urging on these works, and that his personal energy and activity will cause his tenure of office to be illustrated by a remarkable progress. From the Report of Mr. Juland Danvers for 1868, we find that during the twelve months which ended on the 31st March of that year, 349 miles of new railway had been opened for traffic, making the whole extent of line open throughout India 3,943 miles. From the Report for 1869, just published, it appears that 4,096 miles have been completed, and of these 174 were opened during the past year. The total length sanctioned was 5,609. Of these lines the most important are the East Indian, which is to connect Calcutta with the north-western frontier, and the Great Indian Peninsula which runs from Bombay into the interior, and gives a communication between the west coast and the capital. Both these are works that may compare in magnitude, and more than compare in construction, with the chief railroads of America. The Main Line of the East Indian, as sanctioned, is 1,276 miles, of which 1,131 were open on the Ist May last year: the Jubbulpore line, which is con nected with it, is complete, and 225 miles long. Jubbulpore is the point of junction of the East Indian system with that of the Great Indian Peninsula, and to this point there will stretch from Bombay a line 1,266 miles long, of which 873 miles had been completed up to the date I have mentioned. iNow,SUGGESTIONS FOR I / though these results do not compare with what has been accomplished in Europe and America, we must look upon them as eminently satisfactory. It must be remembered how many difficulties the Indian Grovernment has had to overcome in attempting to develope railway communication. The popu lation is certainly vast, and so far, gives a fair basis for enterprise. But it was, or seemed to be, the most stagnant and immovable on the face of the earth. What the Hindoo's forefathers.had done, he would do. The institution of caste, the apathy and helplessness of the cultivator, his distrust of Europeans, tended to keep him always in the same groove. Then there was an almost equal distrust on the English side. While Englishmen would trust their money to the wildest scheme, if the scene of its operations lay in Europe or even in America, they hung back from a country under the dominion of their Queen, held by a British army, and administered mainly by British functionaries. At the time of the great expansion of the railway system in England, some 25 years ago, India had scarcely recovered from the Afghan war, and was soon to be visited by the Sikh war. Trouble followed trouble, and budgets were deranged until the mutiny of the Bengal army gave a death-blow to the old Government. That Government had many merits, but the willingness to attract English energy and enterprise to India was not among them. Companies had been incorporated to carry out railway com munication in India, and the foundation of the existing system was laid, but it is only within the last few years that the full benefits of such enterprises seem to have been felt by Govern ment and people. It may fairly be said that we are now but at the beginning of the railway movement in India. It is computed that 10,000 miles, in addition to the 5,000 which are either open or in course of construction, would provide the neces sary communication through all the chief provinces; and in the Report for 1869 it is assumed that by an annual expendi ture of 3,750,000/., 300 miles could be opened every year, supposing the cost to be 12,000Z. per mile ; and that thus in about thirty years ail the requirements of India would be met without either extraordinary taxation, inconvenient pressure on the public revenue, or objectionable increase of the liabilities oi the State. The Governor-General is pressing on the con struction of the line from Lahore to Peshawur, which it is expected will be finished in two years. The completion of the chord line of the East Indian Kailway, and the last section of the Delhi line, which will have the effect of bringing ( alcutta into direct and uninterrupted communication withA RAILWAY ROUTE TO INDIA, 0 Lahore by a line 1,500 miles in length, may be expected in the autumn of 1870. About the same time the railway between Bombay and Calcutta will probably be completed. The Governor-General is understood to be an advocate of cheap construction for branch lines, believing that these can be made serviceable for all practical purposes for 6,000Z. a mile, as against 12,000/. or a good deal more. The opening up of districts by such cheap railways, for the purpose of bringing their productions to market, is likely to be among the imme diate occupations of the Government ; and happily we may look forward to a term of peace, which will allow the attention of the Government to remain undistracted by military enter prises. India now presents a spectacle such as has never before been witnessed since the first foundations of the Com pany's power were laid. Universal tranquillity reigns through the country ; we stand well with our neighbours, our frontiers are coincident with the natural limits ot the country, and the period of annexation has evidently passed away. All that now remains is to develope and utilize, to digest, as unfriendly foreigners would say, what has been gained. I 1 or this purpose railways, not perhaps of the very first and most expensive class, but rather on the cheap and quickly -constructed Ameri can system, are requisite; and it may be assumed that the Indian Government will want neither the will nor the power to construct them. Mr. Danvers, writing last year, observes that already almost all the principal cotton-fields of the country were connected by the railways with the ports of shipment. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway brings to the port ot Bombay the cotton of Candeish and Berar, and of Barsee and Sholapore. The Bombay and Baroda Railway brings also to Bombay the produce of Guzerat. The Madras line brings o Madras the cotton of Dharwar and Bellary by its northern line, and of Coimbatore and Salem by its southern. Ihe East India conveys to Calcutta the cotton grown m the valleys of the Ganges and Jumna. The Punjab Railway, with the help of the Indus Flotilla and Scinde Railway, brings io Kurrachee the produce of the Punjab and the north-west. The cotton field of Tinnevelly in Southern India, the port for which would be Tuticorin, is at present unprovided with a railway ; but the extension of the Great Southern ai w ay into this district is in contemplation, and surveys are now being made to ascertain the best route. The co on . l lb of Kattiawar, which are at present too far from the railway at Ahmedabad to be much accommodated by it, also lequire a short branch from that place to bring them into communication A 310 SUGGESTIONS FOR with Bombay. 1 Railways,' says Mr. Danvers, f are beginning to tell upon the cotton cultivation of India in other ways than merely providing a more rapid and less costly mode of con veyance than formerly. Steam factories for cleaning cotton are springing up ; machines for half-pressing are established in many places, and in others steam presses for packing the bales for shipment have been constructed. An improvement, it is said, has also taken place in the mode of carrying on the trade in the interior, whereby the ryot is placed in a much better position than formerly.' The Indian Government some time since invited each of the local governments 4 to consider what lines of railway they would regard as desirable to construct (should the necessary funds be available), either within their respective territories, or to communicate with the most important points of the terri tories adjacent, whether British or foreign the object being to insure such a review of all possible lines as would enable^he Government of India and the Secretary of State to make a selection of those particular lines which are most needed, and which most commend themselves for early construction. In the Papers 'relating to Railway Extension in India,' and presented to Parliament, will be found the suggestions of the Government of India to the Secretary of State with regard to the lines which should be thus selected. . Fiom the foregoing statements it will be seen that India is m course of being endowed w T ith effective railway communi cation, and her resources opened to commerce by the care of a Government which may be justly called paternal. Further- more a new impulse is to be given by the more direct action of the Government itself. The guarantee system appears to be efimtely rejected as too costly, as burdening the Government with ail the liabilities without giving it even a hope of the piofits of the enterprise, and as directly encouraging extrava- gance of construction. From the late speech of the Secretary of state for India, the Government appears to contemplate the construction, within the next ten or fifteen years, of 7,000 additional miles of railway; and Lord Lawrence looks forward to the eventual completion of more than 20,000 miles. The important despatch of the Duke of Argyll, just made public, specifies the lines, 18 in number, of which the Government contemplates the construction in India and British Burmah. wh ether by its own immediate action, or by means of guarantees, this work must be really done by the Government. English capital is necessary, for of the 82,376,620/. which has been raised up to the present time, only 800,781/., or less thanA RAIL-WAY ROUTE TO INDIA. 11 one per cent., was subscribed in India. Now this necessary English capital is only forthcoming when there is the security of the Government in one form or another. Such security has been and must continue to be furnished, though the success of the main lines, and the rapid development of the country under a peaceful policy, give hopes that after some years the advantages will be sufficient to attract independent enterprise. We may fairly look forward to a time Avhen India, with its 180,000,000 of people, will be as well supplied with railway communication and as open to the traveller as the continent of Europe. But this is not all. Beyond India lies the immense Chinese Empire, with a population which the most moderate estimates represent at 300,000,000 of souls. The attention of our Indian administrators has been often called by projectors to the feasibility of bringing the two great Asiatic Empires into communication by land. The motion of Mr. Baines, some time since, in the House of Commons, shows that the com mercial world is not indifferent to this subject. Mr. Baines was answered somewhat curtly, as if his plan were altogether visionary. Premature it may be, but \ isiouaiy it ceit 4 iiiily is not; for when India is fairly supplied with railways, the ex tension of the system to China will inevitably follow. At present the journey from Calcutta to bhanghae or 1 ekin resembles, on a smaller scale, that between London and Cal cutta round the Cape of Good Hope, or that between New York and San Francisco over the Isthmus. The traveller must round the Malay Peninsula, and encounter all the delays and perils of a difficult navigation. Yet we hold the V alley ot the Burhampooter and all the sea-coast provinces ot the Burman Empire, and a due exertion of our authority would overcome any political obstacles which a semi-barbarous Go vernment might raise. The plans of Sir Macdonald Step enson for a line of railway connecting our north-eastern provinces with the south-western region of China, have been tor a long time before the geographical world, and though until the Indian system is completed, and the barbarous exclusrveness o _e Chinese Government yields to European influence, there is no likelihood of their being acted upon; yet, considering the immense nonulation of the Indian and Chinese^ mpires,12 SUGGESTIONS FOR resources of its swarming people may be brought to aid in the work of uniting the country to foreign States, instead of leaving the task to be accomplished entirely by European energies.* Let us now survey the prospect which the Old World may be expected to present at a not very distant future. The population which the great Europeo-Asiatic continent contains is very unevenly distributed. At least three-fourths are con centrated in two regions, which lie at the two extremities of the system. At the one end are the civilised nations of Western and Central Europe: the British Isles, with 30,000,000 of in habitants; Fiance, with 40,000,000; Germany, with upwards of 40,000,000; the Austrian Empire, even since the loss of Italy, with nearly 35,000,000; Italy, with 25,000,000; Spain, said now to have 17,000,000; not to mention the minor States. At the other end are the 500,000,000 of the Indo-Chinese region. Between them lie countries fertile and beautiful, gifted in the highest degree with all that can conduce to the prosperity of their inhabitants, but for various reasons, historical, political, and geographical, peopled but thinly, and by races some of which have but a defective and decaying civilisation, while others seem utterly wild and irreclaimable. If the regions of Asiatic Turkey and of Persia were as advanced as Europe, or possessed the population and resources and the strong govern ment of India, the railway would no doubt have already made its appearance. But as it is, we have to face the difficulty, and 1 have no desire to conceal it, that the two wealthy and populous regions of the world which I have mentioned are divided by a great tract where railways are not likely to be constructed by the spontaneous and independent efforts of the people. The question 1 have to discuss is whether, supposing the European continent, with its genius, its wealth, and its indomitable energy, to be traversed by a continuous railway, and the Indo-Chinese continent equally opened up, there will be a prospect of political and commercial advantage sufficient to justify the British Government, either alone or in con junction with others, in joining the two systems by a railway land communication. In other words, do the 280,000,000 of Europe, and the 500,000,000 of India and China require, and can they support, a line to join them ? ^ sub j ec t&gt; I may refer the reader to a paper in the v.nf 8 0 t j 16 ! ,eo 8 Ta phical Society for 1867, i On a Communication wan n ia and China by the line of the Burhampooter and Yanpr-taze/ by General Sir Arthur Cotton, R.E.A EAILWAY ROUTE TO INDIA. 13 When the proposition is stated in this form, one's reason cannot but return an affirmative answer. If the thinly popu lated territory of America can support tens of thousands of miles of railway, including one over mountain and desert and trackless prairie, from the Mississippi to the Pacific, surely it will be politic, and it will pay, to unite three-fourths of the human race. There can be no such superior energy belonging to Americans as should counterbalance the advantages which a scheme of land communication with India would derive from the vastness of the population to be served. Let us therefore now regard the subject in detail, and see what is our present situation, and what has to be accomplished. At the present time there is steam communication, by rail and river, between Calais and Constantinople. The lines, constructed merely to unite neighbouring cities, are not direct, and the speed might almost everywhere be increased. But the traveller can already make the journey by rail from the shores of the Channel to Basiasch, in the neighbourhood of Belgrade; thence take the steamer down the Danube to Rustchuk ; thence take the train to Varna, and so proceed by the boat of the Austrian Lloyd's to Constantinople. This journey can now be made in little more than five days. An important acceleration, however, is about to be made on this great European route. The Porte has long been intent on obtaining a direct line from the Austrian frontier through Widin or Nissa, Sophia, Philippo- poli, and Adrianople to Constantinople, so as to link the capital with the European system of railways. Political dis quiet and the unsatisfactory state of the Imperial credit, in spite of the efforts of the Porte to meet its engagements, have until lately frustrated such a design; but the recent negotia tions with Austrian capitalists promise that it will be success fully carried out. I am not ignorant of the onerous nature of the engagements which the Turkish Government has accepted in order to insure the completion of this work, and I express no opinion on the financial merits of the scheme. ' he Porte will have for some years to meet heavy calls on its resources, and must practice in other matters an economy somewhat un fashionable of late years at Constantinople, if it would not increase to an excessive degree the burdens on its subjects. But of this I am sure, that the importance of these European lines is so great, both politically and commercially, that any reasonable sacrifices may be well made to insure the construc tion of them. The country only wants railways for its develop ment ; as a proof of which it may be mentioned that one little line has in a few years increased its traffic tenfold. However,14 SUGGESTIONS FOR putting aside the financial question, which does not immediately concern my subject, I will suppose a complete railway com munication effected between Belgrade and Constantinople, and the capital of the Turkish Empire linked to those of the Western powers by the shortest practicable line. It is on the shores of the Bosphorus that the great European railway system will end, and that intermediate tract begins which lies between the Western and Eastern masses of popula tion. The traveller who has looked upon the glorious regions of Asiatic Turkey, and knows what vast resources lie there undeveloped, will not be surprised that the notion of pene trating the country by a line of railway and bringing it into close connection with the European world has occurred to many who are by no means over sanguine and enthusiastic. But I am well aware that to my countrymen at home the names of Asia Minor and the Euphrates valley are associated with ideas of stagnation and barbarism, and that he who suggests the appli cation of railway enterprise to such a region has a good many presumptions against him. Now 1 would go so far as to say that, even were there no India in the background, the railway, in a cheap and simple form, might be successfully introduced into Asia. But it need hardly be repeated that this is not the question. We have to inquire whether the profit, political as well as pecuniary, to be obtained by a direct communication with India, together with the advantages to be gained by the development of the intermediate country itself, justifies the making of a line. Before proceeding further, I will sketch the views which I believe would find favour at the Porte, with respect to the construction of a railway through Turkish terri tory. I hey may not agree with those which British statesmen hold to be most for their own country's advantage, but they may show how far the Porte is disposed to meet England in any scheme of improvennint. Before the present negotiations for the construction of the European railway were entered into, the Turks, disappointed at the ill-success of various con cessionaries, who failed in forming the companies for which they had asked concessions, were disposed to adopt the plan of making certain main lines themselves, by the assistance, if it could be obtained, of European capital. There has long been a project to make a line from Belgrade to Constantinople through Nissa, Sophia, Philippopoli, and Adrianople, and then to continue it through the Asiatic provinces to the Persian Gulf. Ihe former part of this undertaking, that is, the line from Belgrade to Constantinople, seems now likely to be under taken. With respect to the latter part of it, the Porte would.A eailway ROUTE TO INDIA. 15 no doubt, gladly enter upon the work, but the financial credit of the empire is not such as to admit the raising of money, except on the most onerous terms, if at all. That a company should undertake the work without a guarantee is almost out of the question, and the Porte has had as unfavourable expe rience of guarantees as the Indian Government. But the Porte would, I believe, be willing to grant favourable terms to the British Government if the latter would take the financial responsibility of the undertaking, as by guaranteeing a loan after the precedent of the war-loan of 1855. The Porte would be prepared to give the land gratis, and to offer to the British Government special securities for the payment of the interest and sinking fund of the loan; to give the supervision and management of the traffic to British authorities, and to cause the net revenue of the railway to be paid in to the Bank of England by a Mixed Commission which would have the control of the enterprise. The prevalence of such views at least indicates the willingness of the Turkish Government to give every encouragement to such an enterprise as a railway through its Asiatic provinces. The jealousy which Europeans gene rally attribute to Oriental Powers has no longer any place in the councils of Stamboul, nor even, I believe, in those of Tehran. Some parts of the route have been already surveyed. A little piece, from Scutari to Ismid, has been thoroughly done ; and more than one route has been examined into the interior, in the directions of Eskishehr, Angora, and Afiun Kara Hissar. The line suggested on more than one occasion is by Ismid, Kutahia, Afiun Kara Hissar, Konieh, Ak-Serai, Yenishehr, Kaissaria, Aleppo. The most difficult part of the line would be that by which it rises from the level of the Sea of Marmora to the great table land of Asia Minor; and between Ismid and Kutahia or Eskishehr there would be a section, happily not of more than ten miles, where the works would cost from 40,000/. to 50,000/. the mile. From Afiun Kara Hissar to the Taurus range there is no extraordinary difficulty. The points for crossing the range of mountains which lie round the Gulf of Alexandretta must be left for future survey ; but it may be said that, although this is, perhaps, the most difficult part of the line, there is nothing in it which may not be easily accom plished at no excessive cost in the present state of science. From Aleppo to the Persian Gulf the route is almost a perfect flat, and the only addition to the cost of the works will arise from the necessity of crossing the various affluents of the Euphrates, which, though almost dried up in the summer, roll16 SUGGESTIONS FOR in the rainy season of the year a considerable current. Passing over geographical and engineering details, with which it is un necessary to swell this pamphlet, I may say that, from the infor mation I have collected on good authority, I believe that a railway constructed with real English solidity, and capable of bearing traffic at a high rate of speed, can be made through the whole'of Asiatic Turkey, from the Bosphorus to the Persian Gulf, for 12,000/. a mile. A much cheaper railway could, no doubt, be constructed; but the line we want being for a fairly rapid passenger traffic, a too parsimonious construction would not attain the object required. Now let us contemplate the future which thus opens to us in connection with India, and consider in how many days India might be reached from England ? Firstly, let us consider what may be reasonably expected in the way of increase of speed on railways during the next ten or twelve years—the period which would be necessary for the construction of the Asiatic line. There is first the section of the journey which is included in Europe, that is, the route from Calais or Ostend to Con stantinople. With regard to this, it must be remarked that nothing can be more erroneous than to judge of the capabilities of the railway system by the present performances of the con tinental lines. As yet, the easy-going natures of our neigh bours have failed to push the railway train to anything like its highest practicable speed. In the first place their lines are, for the most part, less solidly laid, the rail being stretched directly on the wooden sleeper; thus the very high speeds attainable on English lines are somewhat dangerous on the Continent, and will be so until the rails are laid in an improved manner. Then there is the fact that the continentals are seldom in a hurry—the Germans and Germanized races, through whose territories the Constantinople route passes, being among the least intent on rapid travelling. The wearisome slowness of the trains, which move but little faster than a post- chaise and four used to be made to travel on occasion on an English road ; the long stoppages for sausage-eating and beer- drinking, and the defective regulations for connecting the suc cessive parts of a journey, make the European distances seem much greater than they really are. It is only on English lines, or where English wants have to be satisfied and English remonstrances have been applied, that railway travelling is what it should be. The speed of our English trains is well known. The Expresses average 35 to 40 miles an hour, in eluding stoppages, and the train at times attains a speed of 50 miles or more. Now what has been done in England could beA EAILWAY EOUTE TO INDIA. 17 equally done on the Continent, and where the matter has been urged with sufficient perseverance it is done. The express trains on the Great Northern of France carry you at the rate of 40 miles an hour, and you may go from Paris to Marseilles, a distance of 536 miles, in 16^ hours; that is, at the rate of about 33 miles an hour for the whole of that great distance. May not that which is done in England and France be done generally throughout Europe at the end of the next ten years, and an express carried diagonally across the Continent at the same average speed as one may now travel from Edinburgh to Marseilles ? The knowledge of the best modes of constructing railways, so as to combine solidity and durability with economy, is advancing rapidly. The continental guages are better than our own for speed, locomotives have a power which the earlier machines did not possess, and engineers, consequently, are able to make light of the local difficulties which discouraged their predecessors. Now the direct distance from Calais to Con stantinople is not more than 1,500 miles. Allowing 200 miles as a margin for the indirectness of the lines (for the present circuit will be continually shortened as the railway system is developed and new cross lines are constructed), we have 1,700 miles from the shores of the English Channel to the Bosphorus. Assuming that the speed attained between Paris and Marseilles be kept up over this distance, say 33^ miles an hour, or 100 miles in three hours, we have 51 hours from Calais to Constan tinople. On the Asiati c portion of the line I will not venture to assume so high a rate of speed, though I can see no reason why this should not in time be attained. But assuming the line to be well constructed, and the traffic worked by Englishmen, the trains might very well travel at an average speed of 25 miles an hour, including stoppages. Now the distance from Scutari to Bassorah direct is less than 1,300 miles, and as the line would be laid with immediate reference to the through journey, there need not be that circuity which obtains where railways are made with the primary object of joining neighbouring places to each other. But giving here again a margin ol 200 miles, we have 1,500 miles from the Bosphorus to Bassorah. A train travelling at an average of 25 miles an hour throughout would therefore complete the distance in 60 hours; total, 111 hours, or 4 days 15 hours, from Constantinople to Bassorah. Here we have arrived at the limits of the region which has hitherto been thought of in connection with railways. But there is no reason that the enterprise of the world should stop at this point. The southern portion of the Persian territory has not, so far as I know, been examined with reference to railway18 SUGGESTIONS FOR construction. But an engineer of the present day does not need such an examination in order to convince himself that a railway is practicable, lie asserts that a railway is practicable everywhere, except among the lofty mountain ridges of the world; and who can say whether during the next ten years these too may not be surmounted by such mechanical con trivances as have lately been applied to the passage of the Alps. The countries which form the southern provinces of the Persian monarchy, though now fallen from their ancient civilisation, encroached upon by the sand of the wilderness, and exposed during the summer months to great heats, present no insurmountable obstacle to the construction, maintenance, and use of a line of railway. The Government, obeying the instinct which impels the chief Mussulman Powers to place themselves under the shelter of European civilisation, would not only interpose no hindrances to the enterprise, but would aid it, all the more as the ruling people would probably see their own private advantage in so doing. I will therefore suggest that the railway might be continued, in course of time, to Bunder Abbas, otherwise Gombroon, a place belonging now to the Imam of Muscat, and formerly the seat of a considerable trade. It was here that our ships and transports made their rendezvous in the last Persian war, on November 23, 1856. After the conquest of Ormuz by the Persians in the year 1622, il was fixed upon by Shah Abbas as the port and emporium of the commerce which he meditated establishing with India, and it was then called by his name. Formerly several European nations possessed factories here, but the trade has in a great measuie been transferred to Bushehr. As the terminus on the India side of the great Asiatic railway, it would have the advantage ot a situation almost at the mouth of the Gulf, and one allowing an easy intercourse by sea with the countries eastward, without the danger of an inland navigation. The distance from Bassorah to Bunder Abbas direct is about 600 miles, and if we allow ; 00 miles as the length of the railway, tne distance, at the rate of speed of the former Asiatic line, would be traversed in 28 hours. Add to this the 111 hours before mentioned, and we have the duration of the actual transit between Calais and Bunder Abbas, 139 hours, or o days 19 hours. From Bunder Abbas to Kurrachee, along io coast, is a distance of 750 miles, which might be traversed by a steamer m less than three days. If at any future time a rai way were carried along the Mekran coast, this part of the journey would be still further accelerated. But taking Bunder ^ bbas as the terminus, and allowing five hours for the journeyA RAILWAY EOUTE TO INDIA. 19 from London to Calais, we have the whole time from the British capital to the nearest Indian port, exactly nine days. Such are the possibilities of a well-executed railway scheme. It will be observed that I have made no extravagant assump tions. I have only assumed rates of speed that have been already commonly attained, and are far short of what are known to be attainable. The railway would pass entirely through the territories of empires which, though inferior to the West in civilisation and enlightenment, are not ignorant of the advantages offered to them, and are quite strong enough to maintain order and security along the line. The difficulties which suggest themselves in the want of labour or roads, or the desert character of certain districts, resolve themselves into financial questions, the solution of which in other parts of the world, as notably on the Pacific Railroad, gives assurance that they will not be found inexplicable here. I now come to the most formidable objection to the scheme, an objection which long weighed upon my own mind, but which late experience has completely dissipated. I can imagine a smile of incredulity on many faces when the foregoing project of a six days' railway journey is described. People will say that there is surely a limit to human endurance. Reflect on the misery and fatigue that are suffered by any one who travels even for'twenty-four hours in a railway carriage; how, in despite of frequent stoppages, he becomes almost prostrated with weariness, sinks into a broken, unrefreshing sleep, and awakes nervous, aching, and wretched. Is it to be supposed that even the strongest man will willingly endure such torture for nearly a week together, when he can make a comfortable voyage by steamer with all the luxuries of a hotel and with a healthy sleep every night? .A .S for ladies and children the land loute would be 'out of the question. They would simply be killed by exhaustion before they came to their journey's end. To these arguments it may be answered that they are based on the experience of Europe, where the passengers are immuied in carriages which keep them always in the same posture, forbidding them to walk or even to stand; and where during the night the breaths of the sleepers make the air almost pesti lential.' The remedy is no secret. Where the car instead oi the carriage is used there need be no such discomfort. In the United States, where the practice of making long journeys has led to the adoption of improvements unknown in Europe, the railwav is no such terror even to the weakly and delicate. . ic travellers have a long car in which they can shift their seats or move from one place to another. Ihey can leave one group20 SUGGESTIONS FOR of travellers and talk with another, and the monotony which has so depressing an influence in a lonf; European journey is avoided. There is water for them to drink; there are other conveniences which are utterly unknown on a European train. The most useful appliance, however, is the sleeping car. When the traveller is tired he has but to go to bed; he has the relief of taking oflf his clothes, and in a recumbent position he passes the night, at least as well as if he were on board ship. He rises and finds the same facilities for washing and dressing as are furnished on a steamer, and he continues his journey the next day without any sensation of weariness. This is no fancy picture; it is realised every day on all the great routes of the United States. From New York to New Orleans the time is four days and nights, and the journey is constantly made without a break by ladies and children. In short, the easiness of railway travelling is in proportion to the comfort that is supplied, and this is being increased indefinitely. The sleep ing car is not the last invention of the Americans. The rail road to San F rancisco has produced the dining car, and no one need be surprised to hear of a promenade car. Subjoined is a description oi the Pullman hotel or dining car, where three meals a-day are supplied to the travellers exactly as in sta tionary establishments : lli 0 car is about 60ft. long by 10ft. wide, supported on eight-wheeled fombinS T m g J W V • 9 car - J 1118 arran gement, and an elaborate combination of steel springs, give such steadiness, that no serious ioltW unsettles a dish.

Its success was amply demonstrated in the trip across the continent, for nothing could be better than the meals placed before the party three times daily. Imme diately beneath the kitcnen floor, and communicating by trap-doors, are dust-proof ice boxes and provision cellars. Here are packed the fresh meats, the butter, eggs, and other edibles requiring cool quarters for preservation. Spacious water tanks are connected with the kitchen by a force-pump; and the cook and his assistant have everything at hand, almost without turning round. Entering the car to dine, you take your seat. At your side you find a bell. One stroke upon it, and a waiter, neatly clad in white jacket bearing the monogram of the Pullman Company, appears and presents you a bill of fare. Your order is filled, and your savoury steak of beef or antelope, your mountain trout or boiled chicken, are placed before you smoking hot. Wine, tea, coffee, or fresh milk are also at command; and for sauce, what can be more appetising than the air of the Rocky Mountains and the elevated interior plains of the American continent, except, possibly the reflection that you may enjoy your meal in elegant leisure while the train bears you swiftly forward towards your journey's end ? A traveller may obtain a 1 good square meal' of plain food for the dollar or dollar and a quarter which is charged at the station restaurants; while those who desire only a light lunch can command it at trifling cost. The length of time which would eventually be required for the railway journey on the Indian route does not exceed that now spent on the road from New York to San Francisco, and there is no reason that the distance should not be as easily traversed. Moreover, in case the traveller should object to go the whole way at once it would not be difficult to break the journey by resting a day at Constantinople, and another at some point of the Asiatic route, as Aleppo or Bassorah. Indeed the advantages of the land route in point of time would allow much longer halts, without fear of rivalry from the sea route via Suez. For, looking to the future and to the prospects of steam travelling by land and sea, it may fairly be said that the capabilities of the railway in point of increased speed are almost indefinite, while, as far as can be judged, those of the steam ship are limited. To propel a great bulk through stormy water and against a heavy head-wind a power is required which can only be maintained at an enormous expense. The average speed of the steamers on the Marseilles and Alexandria, and the buez and Bombay lines, is not more than 11 miles ^ an hour, and there is no prospect of any material acceleration. Suppose even, what few conversant with the subject will look forwaid to, that an average speed of 15 miles per hour were attained ; even then the railway with its more direct course and its greater speed would make all comparison futile. No one will deny the important services which the Suez canal is likely to render to commerce and to the promotion of extended inter course, but this admirable construction need not prevent the22 SUGGESTIONS FOE attention of European Governments being given to schemes still more effectual for rapid communication. Tt only remains that I should speak of the means to be adopted for carrying out so great a work as this railway. I need hardly confess that it is beyond the limits of private enterprise. It would be too much to expect that unassisted capitalists should devote their funds to making a road through uncivilized regions of the earth, under strange Governments, and with no assurance of a return except through the gradual awakening to life and energy of a continent stagnant for ages. Such a work can only be accomplished by powerful Governments wielding national resources for an ultimate na tional benefit. That the enterprise would in a short time prove remunerative I have no doubt; all Europe, as has been shown, is at one end of the line, and all Asia at the other; and the future must very much belie the past if there be not, before the end of the present century, an intercourse and almost a fusion between East and West which would maintain such a line of land communication ten times over. But in its progress and early use the work could not dispense with Government sup port. There are two principles on which this could be afforded. Either the British Government, in conjunction with those of the countries through which the line is to pass, could guarantee to a private company a dividend on the capital advanced, or it could execute the works itself. The former is the system which has obtained in India, and, no doubt, it has produced results which are far from contemptible. But there are grave reasons for doubting the wisdom of the guarantee system, at least as it has been carried out in practice by the Indian Go vernment. I may refer the reader to a remarkable article entitled 4 Indian Railway Reform,' in the Westminster Review for July, 1869, in which the costliness, and, indeed, the ruinous extravagance of this system, as hitherto applied, are clearly demonstrated. By giving the companies a guarantee of five per cent, on the actual cost of a railway, which cost appears to be in practice whatever the company may choose to spend, there is an absolute premium given to extravagance, and we cannot wonder at hearing that, whereas the estimate for Indian railways generally was 10,000/. a mile, the actual cost has been nearly 20,000/. Ihe other alternative is that the Governments should undertake the work themselves, employing their own engineers, making their own contracts, and economizing their capital by the strict supervision of men of ability, honour, and public spirit,^ such as are always to be found in a national service. 1 he time is past when the bugbear of Government interference could terrify a thinking politician. A Government is only theA RAILWAY ROUTE TO INDIA. 23 people acting in its corporate capacity, and anything that a nation has resolved on for its own benefit or the common benefit of the world may be well committed to the care of its administration. At home, our own Government has taken the management of the telegraphs, as it has long had the monopoly of letter carrying, and there are not wanting those who advocate the purchase and working of all railways by the State. I would therefore suggest that the British Home and Indian Governments in concert, should it be thought advisable, with that of the French Emperor, should come to an understanding with the Porte for the carrying out of this enterprise, on terms that should give the British and Indian communities, which find the money, a practically complete authority in the con struction and permanent working of the line. This w£ should have a right to ask, and this it would be the interest of the Turkish Government to concede; for if ever these Asiatic provinces, with their vast resources now neglected through the ignorance and apathy of many generations, are to recover a place in the world's commerce, it must be by the construction of such a line, to which other lines of rail or ordinary road converging may bring the produce oi the land. For the remu neration of the enterprise we may look, after a few years, to the development of the local traffic, as well as to the intercourse which would be created between the countries which are at the extremities of the system. As the object of this essay is merely to turn the attention of the British Government and people to the question, I forbear to enter into the details of any parti cular scheme. This would be premature. Should the enter prise be resolved upon it will not fail to find among the advisers of the Government men more competent than myself to treat the subject. , ,, , A few words may be added on the political aspect of the scheme. We hear continually of the advance o± the Russians in Asia, and of the prospect that at some future time the Indian Government will have to defend itself, perhaps in the mountains of Afghanistan, perhaps on the banks of the Five Rivers. In the last generation it was predicted that the Cos sack and the Sepoy would meet one day on the banks of the Oxus. There is but little chance of this being realised, for the Russian is already on the banks of the Oxus, and the Sepoy or his successor will never, with the consent of England, advance beyond our present frontier. Central Asia lies open to Russian conquest and domination, and we may take it lor granted, that if the frontiers be brought near each other, it will be solely through the Russian advance. Now, though we may be content that the savage Kirghiz and the fanatical24 SUGGESTIONS FOR A RAILWAY ROUTE TO india. Uzbeg should fall under Kussian rule and receive Russian civilization, it is unquestionably our policy to protect the southern zone of Asia from a similar subjection. Asiatic Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan, belong to what we may fairly call our own system, as distinguished from that where the supremacy of liussia seems inevitable and indeed not undesirable. Now that the Russians have finally subdued the Caucasus, and established themselves firmly on the Cas pian, the pressure on the Asiatic provinces of Turkey, and still more on the effete Persian kingdom, cannot fail to increase. If Russia again ventures on open hostility to the Turkish Empire, her efforts will be rather directed against the north-eastern Asiatic provinces than against the jealously watched Constantinople; and as for Persia, the Russians are already almost at the gates of its capital, for a war under any readily found pretext might add Azerbijan and Mazanderan to the territory of the Czar. The English public may be reminded that the road from Tehran to London is already through Russia. The traveller embarks at Resht on the Caspian for Astrakhan ; there he takes a river steamer and ascends the Volga by an easy though circuitous route to Nijni Novgorod, where he comes within the system of the European railways. There are already companies in the field to make a railway from Resht to Tehran, and the Russian design is to reach the Indian Ocean by a railway across Persia to Bushehr. At the same time Russia is rapidly extending her own internal railway communication. Unless we bestir ourselves, it is almost certain that, before many years are past, the quickest passenger route to India will be through the Russian Empire. 1 liese are matters which may fairly be presented to an English Government for consideration. To quicken, if possible, the inert regions of south-western Asia, to bring them within the European system, to interest in their independence not onlv our own Government, but the most powerful and civilized of our neighbours, and thus to give the world a security against Muscovite conquest, is a work not unworthy of a statesman. No means could be more effective to this end than the opening of the Asiatic regions by a railway. I am happy to believe at oui Indian Empire has statesmen capable of perceiving the importance of such an enterprise, with too large a political ioioaig it to deem it visionary, and with an energy to devote themselves to its initiation. In the confident hope that these remarks will not be lost on the Government and my country men, 1 take leave of the subject. SpottisvXMH 'I C ^ ^tndon and Westminster.f: .

CONSIDERATIONS ON THE POSITION AND PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANY, ADDRESSED TO ITS DEBENTURE-HOLDING &amp; OTHER CREDITORS. * i -V by / JOSHUA DIXON, a debenture director of the company. LONDON: EFFINGHAM WILSON, ROYAL EXCHANGE. 1869. Sixpence,f 0ii()0it, Cbatbiim, &amp; gofer lluiltoan. Gentlemen, After matters had assumed their present shape before Parliament in reference to the affairs of the London, Chatham, and Dover Company, it occurred to me to address to you the following considerations, not as being in anywise opposed to the principles of the Bill now before the House of Lords, but in order to point out that, without at all endangering the passing of this Bill, a fair opportunity is now presented of making the pro posed new constitution of the Company consistent with the rights of Debenture-holders. I am the more induced to do this, because it lias very recently further occurred to me, that an exposition of the views I hold and intend to advocate may induce some Debenture-holders who at present decline to support the Bill to change their course, when they see that by so doing they will gain the most favourable chance within reach ofi I bettering a bad situation, and of acquiring the position they are entitled to. I say this at the outset in order to make it unmistakeably evident, even to those who are inclined to misrepresent, that I decidedly approve of the Bill, and of the course the Directors are now adopting to remedy some defects in it. The Arrangement Act of 1867 provided for the creation of i!600,()00 of A Debenture Stock, the interest on which, to the extent of ^30,000 per annum, is to be entitled to priority over nearly all Debentures and other prior preference claims, called Mortgage Claims, whether the holders of these securities assent to it or not. Although it was, with contemptuous irony, made legally necessary to go through the form of asking their assent, it is not, according to the Act, of the least importance for the validity of the creation of this Stock, whether this assent is granted or refused. The Act also leaves the distribution of the money so to be raised, and the management and future policy of the Company, in the hands of the Share Directors of the Board, who sit there with a permanent voting majority over the De benture-holder or Mortgage Directors. The Bill which has passed the House of Com mons, and is now before the House of Lords, hasfor its object to place the whole affairs, property, rights, claims, management, and constitution of the Company, of its Shareholders, Creditors, and Debtors of every kind and description, at the ab solute disposal of two Arbitrators, to deal with as they think best for the rights and interests of all concerned, and giving these arbitrators speci fically the power not only to continue the already granted right of creating ^600,000 of A Stock to take precedence of Debenture and other preferred claims, but to increase this sum to ^950,000. Although this Bill is promoted by the Directors of the Company, it has been almost com pletely changed from what it was when it received the sanction of the Shareholders and Debenture- holders, and when it was introduced into the House of Commons. This change is very serious indeed, and does not merely affect details of arrangement, but introduces new and important intentions, and is not limited to making that compulsory which was before permissive. It was brought about mainly by parties other than the Directors, and whatever may be the merits of the alterations in some respects, there are included with them several provisions for the benefit of certain ordinary and other creditors, some of whose claims some of the Directors considerto be unwarranted in amount, and of doubt ful propriety in their nature. An unfortunate appearance of log rolling and lobbying is thus pre sented, that does not look quite so fair and above board as it would have done had the claims to which these provisions refer been also relegated, with the general mass, to the decision of the Arbitrators. It is now for you, the creditors of the Company, to consider what view you should take of your rights, and what course of action you will adopt in vindication of your views. If the present opportunity is not seized, and a vigorous, decided stand taken, the case will be concluded against you very soon; and it may be concluded against you in such wise as most unjustly to in vade your rights as Debenture and Preference holding creditors of the Company, and as ordinary Creditors, for the purposes of preferring certain favoured ordinary and other creditors, and of most unduly and unwarrantably favouring your debtors, the so-styled Shareholders of the Company, whose Shares are mostly a fiction. It is indeed not only your interests that are in peril, but such a precedent as certain interests are now seeking to establish and confirm must go far to endanger the interest and shake theconfidence of every Debenture-holder in the kingdom, and of every ordinary creditor also, who cannot rely, as on a positive certainty, on the perfect and perpetual solvency of the Company whose security he holds. With regard to the reference to the decision of the Arbitrators of all the concerns of the London, Chatham, and Dover Kailway Company, other than the right of raising money over the heads of the Debenture-holders without their consent, the Bill, with the emendations which the Directors intend to advocate, has my thorough concurrence and approval, as it will then be clear oi any undue preference of one Creditor over another, and ot those peculiarities which might be supposed to favour the designs of holders of securities in the weakest and almost entirely worthless sections, who would be very certain to be the - gainers if any hotch-potch scheme of reconstitution were to be hastily adopted, before the priorities of the diffe rent classes of Creditors are settled. The vast variety of contending claims, of conflicting rights arising from inconsistent Acts of Parliament obtained by misrepresentations, from deceptive statements put forward to mislead those who are now the creditors of the Company, and from deeds of agreement drawn up in the loosest and most negligent man-BHBHtBRBHHMHHOTRBDRnnBBmQBHMMMRRM ■nasii uer, together with the inevitable delays consequent on the inability of the Court of Chancery to come to speedy decisions, and the inefficiency of the present Board of Directors—inherent in its very constitution and in the system of working it has adopted, more than arising from any want of capa city in the Directors individually—make some such course advisable as the only way of cutting the Gordian knot, which, Laocoon's serpent like, is strangling in its folds all the revenue-producing power of the Railway, and delivering it over a prey to litigation. I am even willing, as the only means of escape from the present situation, than which nothing can be worse for all the Creditors of the Company, to refer to the decision of the Arbitrators the point as to the right of raising money over the heads of the Debenture-holders without their consent. But I still strenuously object to its being done unless with the accompanying con cession to the Debenture-holders of a controlling majority in the future Direction. Without this, the proceeding would, in my opinion, be an injustice and a wrong so grievous in its nature and extent, that no existing necessity can be an apology for it. I have little doubt but what the Arbitrators wiH take this view.What is really the state of the case as between the Debenture-holders and other creditors on one side, and the Company consisting of Shareholders on the other side ? Under the term Debenture- holders I include in this pamphlet all those Creditors who shall be shown to hold preference claims, similar to those of the Debenture-holders, of lien on the tolls nett or gross, and speak of other creditors on open account not having such lien on tolls as ordinary creditors. 'What is the state of the case as between Debenture-holders and other Creditors and the Company ? The Debenture-holders are Creditors of the CompanVj with the security of a certain lien on tolls, who have been induced to lend their money to the Company mostly on deceptive representa tions made to them that all the capital of the Company was subscribed, and that one-half of it was paid up ; a condition precedent imposed by Parliament on the existence of any borrowing powers, in order that lenders on Debentures might know that there was a security pledged entitling the Company to come forward as borrowers. The Company here is the debtor, which has obtained the greater part of the money of the creditors under this pretext; but the pretext was false and fraudulent, as has been abundantly shown in the B10 Report of the Committee of Investigation, in the proceedings in Sir Morton Peto's bankruptcy, and in other legal documents. There is no point to take this case out of the analogy of that of an ordinary insolvent debtor and his creditors, except that the Company has its legal existence only for tjbs pur pose and under the condition of making and maintaining a railway, which is understood to be a matter of public convenience. This debtor, how ever, after obtaining his creditor's money under false ju-etences, has become utterly insolvent, in capable of meetiug the demands of various large creditors who will not wait, and, except by their forbearance, unable to fulfil the duty owing to the public. What, then, is the natural and proper course to be pursued ? Why, the usual and or dinary one forced on debtors in general,—that they should give up their property into the hands of their creditors, to be managed by them for their own benefit, in their own way, until their claims are satisfied, with a reversion to the debtors of theii property when and if the claims on it are extinguished. This is the customary mode of proceeding, by law established, in dealing with such cases, from big Overend, Gurney, &amp; Co., who failed lor far more than the value in fee simple of the 'whole London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, ' '' '11 down to the humblest retail trader; and why should not the same process be adopted here ? Why should this case in particular be marked by the singular and outrageous peculiarity of com pelling the secured creditor (secured not by some clandestine arrangement with his debtor, but by the stipulations of well-known and generally acted on Parliamentary law) to forego his hold on his lien, in order that money may be raised on the security filched from him, for the purpose of enabling the insolvent debtor to carry on his affairs, which he has shown his utter incapacity of doing in an honest and business-like manner? There are but two ways in which such a proposal can be apologized for or palliated, and these are,—either the allegation that the public interest demands it, or that the creditor cannot and the debtor can, carry on the business. Neither of these pretexts will, however, avail here; for the Debenture-holding and other creditors can certainly carry on the Kailway better than the insolvent Shareholders, and the public good and convenience is equally well cared for, whether the Railway is properly carried on by one or the other party. It is impossible to refute this, as a plain and exhaustive statement of the real obvious merits of the case, and public morality as well as economic b 212 expediency, demand that it sliould be carried out to its legitimate results. The nature and magni tude of the interests involved are no reasons for departing from, but, on the contrary, should be considered as strong inducements to uphold the usual course of justice, because the importance of railway interests, and of the Debenture-holding interest that so materially assists it, is so great, that it will be exceedingly useful and advantageous to hold up to Eailway Companies generally, such an example of the penalties incurred by Share holders who permit an improvident and wrongful course of conduct, as will induce them in future to watch more closely over incipient deviations from the paths of business propriety and rectitude. Even if it were only the case with the London, Chatham, and Dover Company, of failure to meet its obligations to its creditors, simple justice de mands that it should hand over its property to those creditors. But how much more is this called for, when the great mass of its creditors are asked to forego their especial lien of security, in order that money may be raised to enable the debtors to carry on their concerns ! It is an outrage on every principle and feeling of justice, to compel the creditor to advance more money to be handled by his profligate and wasteful debtorIS in carrying on his mismanaged affairs; and this feeling is increased by the exacerbating reflection that the Debenture creditor has already been duped into his position by false and fraudulent represen tation on the part of his debtor. It is true that inasmuch as railways and the failure and insolvency of railways are com paratively new things, legislation has not provided adequate and suitable machinery for administering the affairs of such bankrupts. But this is very easily provided for, and it will argue great negligence or incapacity in our legal and legisla tive rulers, if this is not speedily done in such wise as will enforce the requirements of prudence and honesty on railway as well as on other trading companies and private individuals. Meanwhile special legislation of a very exceptional character, as in the Arrangement Act of 1867, and in the Bill that has just passed the House of Commons, has already been made, or is sought further to be made, available. All that is wanted in order, in this case, to satisfy the requirements of common justice is that you should not be compelled to waive your rights of priority, unless a controlling majority in the future management is conceded to you, and that the arbitrators should take a broad view of the general merits of the case as between an14 insolvent debtor who can neither pay his debts nor fulfil his duty to the public on the one hand, and the creditor who has the means of enabling the Com pany to pay its way and discharge its duty to the public on the other hand. Such view of the case in evitably points to handing over the debtors' estate to the management of the creditors. If this is done, and you are enabled through a Board of Directors elected mainly, if not entirely, by yourselves to direct the affairs of the Company, instead of being obliged to trust to others whose interests are not your interests, and whom you cannot control although they are spending your money, I have no doubt you will be quite willing, and I for one should strongly urge you to it, to forego your priority in order to raise what is 'absolutely needed to make the Railway available to the utmost extent for in creased revenue, which would be applied towards paying the interest of your Debentures, and towards making proportionately just payments to the ordinary creditors. It may also be well, if it can suitably be done, to raise enough money to recoup what has been paid out of Eevenue to Capital Account, and so to have funds for the more speedy resumption in part of payment of the interest on Debenture and15 other claims. To the extent that this can be judiciously done, it would be desirable that it should be done, and you can expect no better guarantee that it would be judiciously done, than that afforded by your own choice of a controlling majority in the Direction of the Company. Do not allow yourselves to be deluded by any plausible pretexts, that in seeking this right to control the management of the Eailway, you are seeking the vindication of a barren and useless right; that the interests of Shareholders are iden tical with yours, because your interest must be paid before they can receive a dividend, and that, therefore, you may safely trust to them. If the identity of interests is so complete, then it tells equally well for the converse of the argument, that the Shareholders may safely trust their in terests to your guidance. And you are additionally entitled to say that as you are asked to supply the money, or the equivalent of it, in the waiving of your right of lien by which alone the money can be got, and as you alone for many long years (cer tainly not less than fifteen, even if past due interest is funded) will be entitled to reap any advantage in the way of income from the liailway; there fore, on these grounds, you are fully entitled to control the management. But the truth is, that16 although the interests in one point of view may be said to be similar, yet it is not by any means the same to you whether the Railway is managed by your nominees, or by the present Direction. There has remained in the working of the concern since the passing of the 44 Arrangement Act' of 1867, which gives a voting majority at the Board to the Shareholders, far too much of the leaven of the old elements that have made the London Chatham, and Dover Railway such a conspicuous example of reckless and improvident enterprise carried out with the most wasteful and profligate expenditure. There are already sufficiently alarm ing symptoms that with the opportunity will re appear the inclination for further outlay to a large amount for projects of extension, in respect to which the most favourable opinion that can be passed is, that it may.be possible that their feasibility as a paying outlay can be plausibly advocated, which, however, I for one do not believe ; while it is certain that it cannot be satisfactorily shown. The policy of those who at present influence, and in the end really control, the Company, is not, and never will be, the true policy of Debenture-holders, ordinary Creditors, nor of the Shareholders either; and if you are called upon to waive your rights of priority, you are entitled to insist on such arrange-■ 17 ments as will enable yon to carry out a Debenture- holder and Creditor's policy. Even that part ol the proposed application of A stock by this Bill, which refers to paying vendors' and other liens on lands purchased by the Company, specious and unobjectionable at first sight as it appears, would very probably, as it now stands, result in paying away more A stock for the lands than they will bring back when re-sold. Such a course would, in that case, have the effect, not merely of giving to vendors and mortgagees of land the full value of their security for which they have a lien, and to which they are indisputably entitled, but it would also give them payment, at the expense of Debenture-holders and ordinary Creditors, for such deficits as may arise between the sale proceeds of the land and the nominal amount of their lien, and for which deficit they have no claim to rank as other than ordinary creditors. If care is not taken to avoid this, the contingency is pretty sure to occur, to your serious detriment. Debenture-holders form as suffering a portion as any of the creditors of the Company, and I believe no other Eailway Company in the kingdom shows such a numerous list of very small investors scat tered over the country. It is, therefore, most unjust to call upon you to sacrifice yourselves still18 further for tlie bGnGtit ot some creditois on op6n account, which would seem to be expected from you, judging bv remarks tliat fell, no doubt incon siderately, from one of the members of the Com mittee of the House of Commons when this Bill was before it. The Bill as it stands now provides that, within a month after its receiving the Royal Assent, the Board of Directors shall present to the arbitrators a scheme 44 for the reconstitution and future government of the Company, the modification and re-adjustment of its borrowed and share capitals, funds, rents, charges, and separate stocks respectively, and the application of its revenue and other property.' You will observe that this scheme will have to be settled at a Board at which the Shareholders have a voting majority, which is a very objec tionable feature for you Creditors, to say the least. It is a very convenient clause, however, for those outsiders who may wish for haste, in order by clever manoeuvring to smuggle through, under pretence of the necessity for a compro mise, schemes which will favour the inte rests of holders of securities on almost worth less sections, such as the Eastern Section and the City Lines, to the detriment of holders of securities on the better, and, as regards their19 Debentures, comparatively substantial sections, such as the Metropolitan Extension and the General Undertaking. It is utterly impossible to propound any scheme, deserving of attention, for the future constitution of the Company, until it is settled and promulgated which interests (as for example 'Western Extension) are or are not part ners with the Shareholders, and so liable or not, to postponement of their claims after Debenture and other Creditors, and until the relative position of the different classes of Debenture Creditors and of the holders of Common Fund and Victoria Im provement Fund, and others, both inter se in the same section, and inter se in different sections, is settled. Some of these classes claim on the Me tropolitan Extension, some on the General Lnder- taking, which are the best of a bad lot of five different sections, while some classes claim on the worst of these five sections, as on the Eastern section and on the City Line; while some have, and some perhaps have not, a contingent supple mental claim on the General Undertaking and perhaps also on the Metropolitan Extension. Again, it is impossible to appreciate the pecuniary position of the Company, until it is settled what are, and what are not, valid claims against it by outsiders, in respect of which there are now con-tentions involving hundreds of thousands of pounds. It is the sheerest fatuity to talk of pro pounding a scheme for the fusion of the Company until these points are settled and the settlement made known ; unless indeed it is intended to de cide it by the intelligible, but not very intelligent, process of tossing up for it; and even then it has first to be decided who is to be allowed to join in tossing up. But if a scheme is to be called for on hypo thetical bases, then the only reasonable one would be, that the Eailway should be governed in the same way as railways generally are, by Directors elected by those who have a substantial present beneliciary interest in it, and who are the parties that have, or at least ought to have, the right to consent or not, to the arrangements necessary for raising money, if it is required. The interest of the Debenture-holders, and of those equal or superior to them in position, may be taken at a figure compounded of the amount of their claims increased by their quality, in respect of lien on tolls; the interest of the ordinary Creditors should then be taken at the amount of their claims simply, as they have no lien except on the rolling stock ; and the interest of the Shareholders would be approximated to by a calculation of the valuer of their reversionary claim after the Debenture- holders and ordinary Creditors are satisfied. These three figures respectively would give the proportions that each interest ought to have, approximately, in the election of Directors and in voting power generally. With this basis to start from, a fair and suitable representation at the Board and in Meetings could be provided for. That done, the reconstituted Company would stand in the position of Shareholders holding active and deferred stock, the active stock having the con trolling power, and would possess the rights, and should be invested with the power, of pledging the first-fruits of its nett income if needful and fit, in order to borrow money to enable it to work the Eailway or to improve and make it more available. And it might, advantageously, further have the power of borrowing money, if obtainable on suit able terms, for recouping to revenue the amount applied during the last two years to Capital Account, in order to expedite the period of partial resumption of payment of interest on Debentures, and to ordinary Creditors. The Board would then be the judges of the propriety of borrowing or not borrowing, subject only to the obligation to work the Railway so that the public would be duly served. If this obligation were not complied with.22 it would be for Parliament to step in, and put others in possession who would do it; but short of this there would be no further call for inter ference, as the Railway would be under the control of those who are most interested in its prosperity, and by whose money it has been mainly created and equipped. This is all that legislation should seek to effect, and with this the reasonable claims of all parties would be satisfied. The Railway would be left to fight its own way to more or less profitable results as it best could, and the public be relieved of the nuisance of hearing it discussed, which of itself would be no inconsiderable public benefit. In conclusion, the value that parties interested ought to place on the representations made to them, depends very much on the position and leading interests of the person who makes them. It would be well if all readers and listeners, in this as in other cases, would ascertain this with precision, that they may not be misled into fan cying that the interest of the person addressing them is identical with their own, when it is in reality only apparently so. I will therefore, in addition to signing my name, say, that I have from the beginning unswervingly held the views herein expressed, and that I have no interest, direct23 or indirect, in the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company, and its dependencies or ci-devant dependencies, other than ^10,000 of the Deben tures of the Metropolitan Extension, ^10,000 of the Common Fund Stock, and a considerable amount of Debentures of the Kent Coast Company, all of which I took from the Companies at par, or half per cent, discount. The pecuniary position of the Kent Coast Railway Company is totally distinct from, and independent of, that of the London, Chatham, and Dover Company, and the contention between the two Companies as to the agreement between them is a matter that must be settled by law or by arbitration, and has been initiated and carried on without my participation or interference. Whether the agreement is upset or not, the Kent Coast Company will have ample revenue for the discharge of its Debenture interest, so that this contention and its results is a matter of perfect indifference to me. As a point of delicacy and precaution, however, I have always abstained from taking any part, whenever Kent Coast matters came up at the Board. I think, therefore, that I have a good claim to be considered as a reliable representative of the Debenture-holding and Creditors' interests of the London, Chatham, and Dover Company.24 As long as the Arrangement Act was the law to be observed, I have done my best to promote harmony of action at the Board, and to confine my aims within its scope and conditions; but when it is a question of setting aside this Act, I claim, as of right, an independent voice in en deavouring to influence the changes about to be made, and to inform the parties principally con cerned as to what T conceive to be their true interest and policy. I am a decided and warm advocate of the plan of arbitration ; but T seek, and advise you to seek, to make its course consistent with, and not sub versive of, right and justice.

One Shilling.A rvaillvian Jfatts anb Coiocr .fares. I t is very pleasant to contemplate persons who may be trying to save us two-thirds of our present outlay in Railway Fares; and the same theory applied to rent, clothes, or food would be equally alluring. It so happens that a good deal of our Railway Fare is already made up to us by the saving of cost in the item of food through the instrumentality of our Railways. I feel that, in drawing attention to the within- mentioned facts, I shall not appear to be on the popular side of the question at issue. There are certain conclusions arrived at, on my part, by the perusal of our Railway statistics; if my deductions should prove to be wrong, I have nevertheless given them in good faith as a few crumbs to feed the discussion as to the possibility of lowering Railway Fares. It is possible to compute how many persons make of necessity 300 day-trips each year; it is possible to estimate the number of millions who are so distant from any Railway station that to them the Fare is a matter of indifference. If any process of treating the Fares could double the holiday-making travellers, then I shall discover A 2they have been more careful of their cash than I have hitherto given them credit for. Should the Government decide upon purchasing the Irish Railways, they will acquire an experience which will enable them to deal with such other Railwavs as they may deem expedient. When once they become the property of the nation, no waste will be permitted to exist; and I doubt whether the nation would allow itself the same frequency of trains as are furnished by our present Railway Companies in their competitive race for the good opinion and patronage of the public; at all events, until the traffic made a greater demand upon the vacant space. It is the frequency of trains which causes vacant space ; it is this space which nourishes the cheap Fare theory. There are many well-meaning persons who are handling our whole Railway system with their pen and their calculations. They are, to a cer tain extent, popular; cheap Fares are the quo tients of their conclusions, and it is assumed that not only may we have to pay less for our Railway Fares, but that, if the nation were to become possessor of our 14,247 miles of Railway, even taxpayers might reap a benefit. I have just read, in the 'Quarterly Review,' the 'Great Railway Monopoly.' I recommend it to the notice of those who may wish to understand the complica tions involved in millions of trains run and mil lions of tons moved. Had I seen it nine months ago, I should have attempted to embody in my pamphlet, 'A Mile of Railway in the UnitedKingdom,' some conclusions as to profits derivable from goods as compared to passengers. Mr. Haugliton lias published a pamphlet upon paying and non-paying weight, which will much enlighten those persons who handle the Railway system under the impression it will bend to meet the theories they advance. This question of non- paying weight comes before us in varied forms; it always exists, and can be traced backwards for sixteen years. It is w T ell known to our principal Railway men how, when, and where it appears in its worst form ; you may call it, if you will, our Railway phantom; for who dares say he will grasp it, or rid us of it ? We do not appear to have discovered how to remedy this weak point. Every train contains a fraction of it, of some moment even when dealt in by the hundred weight, and of enormous importance when the conglomerate weighs millions of tons, which again mean hundreds of thousands of pounds sterling. Mr. Haughton, at page 11 of his pamphlet, shows us this ' phantom ' in the enormous non- paying weight hauled in the year 1867. Sugges tions are forthcoming from some who appeal- practical, and others who appear to ignore the many known deductions arrived at in working the Railways of the United Kingdom. Before proceeding any further with my remarks, I should like to point to that coke-consuming, oil-drinking steam horse. He consumes from 30 to 45 lbs. of coke per mile run {vide ' Quarterlyr ; rnrnJttm Review '), according to whether he does hunting or farm work. He has his driver and attendant, food and water, &amp;c., always at hand. He works for a certain two or three hours per day during ten months of the year ; the other two months he is in the hands of the locomotive veterinaries; and without reference to his original cost, which varies from ^2,500 to ^3,000, there is annually expended upon him J£6S5. 9s. to feed, house, groom, and doctor him. At the end of 15 years he dies. Although he was bred in England, there are few of us that will not be astonished at these remarks. Its ways now are very little known ap parently, so far as to how it gets through its time. This shows, when at work, 52 miles a day, accom plished as an average, taking the year as consisting of 3»J0 working days. II it rests at night or day, according to services required, 52 miles appear a small result for even 12 hours' outing. As out of every &lt;£100 spent in the working of our Railways nearly 28 per cent, is attributable to feeding and tending this steam horse, it would be interesting if we could get a few diaries written on a given day by the drivers of locomotives on one or two Railways, not all metropolitan, not all trunk lines, so that we could have before us how a locomotive gets through a day. We may be getting all w e can lor our money, but a little more coke against more work might bring us extra profit, unless, indeed, he lasts 15 years, because vo only work him up to 52 miles a day; perhaps, it we put him up to 104 miles, he will only last7 7^ years, and get laid up four months out of the year. If the locomotive headed the charges, it would not be more than one would expect; but coaching charges and merchandize carry the day by nearly 1 per cent. We are one and all interested in travelling as cheaply as we can. I, amongst the general public, plead guilty to saying I wish I could save half my fares. I have attempted to show that a certain vacant space must exist in our trains as part of the nature of the traffic, that there seem to be seats which might be filled, but only at a loss to do so by lower fares. The locomotive has full work at one hour, com paratively nothing at another. That arises from our habits and customs, created by our wants. A train averages 19 miles for pas sengers, and 30f for goods. The wants of the public do not fully employ them for those distances. The traffic and the trains go hand in hand. The take per mile run remains fixed with a traffic multi plied by four. I have shown the impossibility of dealing with even a reduction of 2d, average, except at the inconvenience of the travelling public. Over 800,000 passenger trains are added in three years, a train for every 72 extra per sons. (If a train could take 144 persons, why do we, the public, have over 400,000 trains more than were necessary, that is, if cheap Fares had existed ?) Can a Kailway Company move two persons in place of one without loss, unless the terms be8 higher for two? If the passengers had been equally distributed over all trains that ran in 1867, 1,670,914 trains or carriages equal to those trains could have been saved. The first and second-class paid about X'2,500,000 sterling above that paid by third-class, and yet 69,000,000 more third-class passengers had to be drawn, necessitating work equal to over 300,000 more trains. Profits under these heads are consi dered. The increase of third-class dilutes the average per head. Eight years' work considered, net receipts diminish. Are all passengers to be dealt with as weight without reference to quality further than the difference in the value of carriages and other accommodation ? I would rather now pass on to the points themselves, which I have compressed ' oO as small a compass as I have been able, ian dwell upon them. The ' Quarterly Review ' informs the reader that the average of passengers per train in 1866 was 73 persons exclusive of season tickets. If, however, we wish to deal with the figures to any practical end, we must compute the trips made by holders of 110,227 season tickets, which I consider will add 9 trips per train, raising the average to 82. They were all probably first and second-class. The writer in the ' c Quarterly Review ' quotes the opinion of an authority that f of a penny per mile upon 100 passengers will pay; he states that the passenger trains averaged 19 miles, whilst the passengers only averaged 8^ miles* If he is correct in this assertion, thecheap Fare theory lias already received a heavy blow, inasmuch as the passengers have averaged 4^ miles above 1866, in the year 1867. The cost of running a mile is put at Is. 3d.; if that be correct, other charges came to Is. 5d., as the average of all charges against the mile run was, say, 2s. 8d. I ventured to assert in a pamphlet styled a ' Mile of Kailway in the United King dom,' that a locomotive (so far as passengers are concerned) could pull as much again as it hauled in 1867. I will not, however, endorse the state ment that the trains which then ran could have conveyed twice as many passengers without additional carriages ; the evidence furnished by averages forbids me to do so. I have lately read comments upon a scheme for lowering our Fares, wherein the author anticipates that if his theory were adopted, the passengers might multiply by six, and yet little or no expense be added. If the trains were not capable of meeting a doubled traffic, more than 4-6ths would be unprovided with accommodation. How he contemplates taking them to their destination with little expense, I cannot guess. In the comments I read his Fares were stated as averaging 7d. per passenger. The Fares named Is., 6d., 3d. for the three classes. If the classes were to travel in equal proportions, 7d. would be the average, but dealing with them as they travelled in 1867, the average would be 4£d. This average applied to the trips made in 1867 would reduce the amount received so materially WW. II10 as to make the deficit 9 millions. It changes 14 millions sterling into 5 millions. If I am right in asserting a doubled traffic surpassed the capabilities of the trains which earned the 14 millions sterling, then the changed average could not produce 10 millions sterling. To try the future we must taste the past. Mr. Haughton informs us, at page 12 of his pamphlet, that the passenger trains of 1867 averaged a run of 19 miles, and the passengers' trips only averaged 12| miles; this appears like a icaste of one-third of the mileage run. I do not call it a loss, because it is impossible to avoid it in part. The fare of a passenger we know is (justly so) based upon the journey he wishes to make, class and train entering into the question, and not upon the distance the train will run after he has alighted. Cheap Fares would be more likely to induce short trips than run up the 12f mile average. The ' Quarterly' says that the stage coach trips averaged 12 miles, also that a train would hold 200 passengers. I grant a train can convey 200; I even go further, and say it may pick up and set down passengers on its trip which shall make the total equal to 300, the average being 82 only. So much the worse for the ' phantom ' in other trains which bring that 300 down to 82. Out of several hundreds of trains started in a day by any given Company, very few would boast of 300. I can only suggest two fixed laws which would make every mile traversed by a passenger train a11 full paying mile : the first is, that 200 passengers should fill the train and travel the whole run ; the other is, that 200 passengers should start in the train, and that 50 should get in as 50 got out. Can such a wonderfully-balanced traffic as this ever exist ? We have many great centres, of which London stands at the head : can it be that as 50 passengers alight from the down trains at Blackheath, Slough, or Harrow, they will be re placed by three fifties from those places, the train, too, leaving London in its rear ? Trains may start full from our busy centres at certain hours of the day, but we may yet find it impossible to counteract or negative the creation of non-paying space, the result of empty seats, under either present or future conditions. We ought first to define the trains and hours which more especially keep down the average travellers to 82; any extra passengers will be wanted more especially to fill these gaps. It cannot be for want of increase of traffic that our trains are not filled. Since the year 1849 we have more than quadrupled the numbers of Railway passengers. Although our platforms would have been too short, carriages could have been added to the trains, but there must be some good reason why this plan would not have given satisfaction. Further on, the reader will perceive every additional 72 persons coming to the Railways have been supplied with a train. The Board of Trade Returns of the Railways for 1868 will probably show that 350 millions of trips12 have bsen made at lid. average. The trips came in 1867 to 82 per train; if I am right in my num bers, it will require additional trains over and above 1867, say 343,668. If the Fares he reduced Id. average, unless 35 millions of passengers pre sent themselves in consequence, the money taken will be less at lOd. than on the smaller number at lid. If the Fares be lowered 2d. average, unless 77,777,813 persons present themselves in like manner, the money at 9d. a head a\eiage will be less. Here I may remark that these extra pas sengers cannot be conveyed by the 843,668 pro vided for the previously increased traffic, even if they are entirely given up to them. How the hostile forces weigh upon us as the Fares go down wards ! Nearly 428 millions of passengers to tend and convey, to bring the same Fares as produced by 350 millions to meet a reduction of 2d. average. If you do not raise the train service of 1867, it puts the average up to 109 trips per train. Hie case before us at this point is this : can the Rail way Companies tend and convey 78 millions of passengers without increasing the trains in num ber or length, or adding to their expenses ? If they can, why does the train account stand thus ? Trains despatched in 1864 .... 3,106,651 1867 .... 3,924,624 an addition in three years of 817,973 trains, being one train against every 72 passengers added to the account of 1864, showing a remarkable tenacity to the average which, without season tickets, is put at 73 per train.13 We added 817,973 trains to convey an addition of 58,415,948 trips. To make 9d. recoup (by 88 millions more trips) the money which lid. showed, we are not to add one train ; in other words, 59 millions of persons, paying lid. average, require over 800 thousand trains, but for 78 millions, averaging 9d., not one is to be added. Lower the average of the price paid per trip to 5jd., and you must double your numbers. Make lid. into 5^d., and 700 millions of trips make the gross fares the same; but how about the debit side of the question, for hauling 350 millions of human beings, weighing from 1 cwt. to 2 tons a piece, (according to the theory adopted) against the locomotive. Is it possible that some of those persons who argue in favour of Cheap Fares overlook the points 1 have referred to ? A closer examination of Eailway statistics will show that a train capable of holding 200 passen gers at starting is only likely to average 133, The trains go 19 miles, the passengers 12f ; the waste is about one-third, say 67 seats; the balance of 133 would be thus accounted for: average passenger trips, 82 ; seats which might be filled, 51 ; and which vacancies probably arise in trains which ran at unimportant hours of the day, so far as the average wants of man were con cerned. If it be found that Hallways can meet an in creased traffic without adding trains or carriages, it will then remain to be shown that the Kailways14 are held harmless, from extra demand of power to haul the weight, friction, extra guards, porters, &amp;c., vans for luggage, wear and tear of carriages, cushions, paint, per-centage of any other items, &amp;c. The additional bustle and crush, the hitherto well-served English public will, of course, agree to, vide the fact that the Fares would be lowered. If trains when once made up must w T ork (as made) all day, the paying and non-paying weight must necessarily be in proportion to the traffic of the hours of the day. These laws are not the result of any scale of Fares. The paying and non-paying mile are the commercial side of the same ques tion, and, therefore, the mile run of every train carries in it every element having reference to the judicious management of railway work, whether on behalf of all Railway proprietors who form a large section of a larger public, or on behalf of that public. That the non-paying weight should to a certain extent |be beyond control, is due to a combination of causes: men are called to busy centres at certain morning hours, and are recalled to their homes at evening in like manner, demanding heavy trains with locomotives equal to the task. A locomotive can haul 400 tons. Two of half the weight might haul 200 tons each. Additional drivers would be required, and frequency of trains already hampers our officials. Additional sidings, not to say permanent way, are looming in the distance as it is. If all the passengers of 1867 had been des-15 patched in trains made up of separate classes, without admitting the possibility of a vacant seat, they could have been despatched as under :— Trains. 7 First-class carriages, 168 per train 188,843 7 Second „ 224 „ 346,877 7 Third „ 224 „ 797,420 Season tickets, say ... 140 ,, 357,143 Without a vacant seat 1,690,283 Add one-third waste, passengers alighting, or slack business 563,427 2,253,710 Carriages hauled, but not used by the public over all trains, equal 1,670,914 Number of trains in 1867 3,924,624 I have before stated that the average was 82 per train, and that 51 seats might have been filled ; total, 133 per train. To cause the trains of 1867 to average that number, 522 millions of persons must travel, or that number in trips must be made. Including season tickets, there were made 338 million trips, so that seats w T ere probably vacant equal to 184 millions of trips. To convey them, however, the then slack trains must be imagined as full as the best trains. Carriages are probably hauled all day although it is thoroughly understood they will not be wanted for certain hours; Where to put them and how to find them in the right place when wanted, if once uncoupled, may be a difficulty.16 Perhaps \vc cannot have lighter engines and carriages for portions of a clay for the same reason, mixed powers of locomotion I can ima gine not being practicable. I am not competent to solve these questions, but they are not likely to have been overlooked by those who manage this wearing, tearing train work. There are certain hours in which our Railway officials are sorely puzzled to get through their work. If there are hours of slack business and empty trains, there should we be found at work. If the quiet hours be from twelve until four, tickets issued on a reduced scale of charges, and called four-hour tickets, would test the desire to travel, if the rates hitherto charged have deterred a per-centage of the population from coming for ward. There is room for contemplation in the following figures ;— In 1867, the first and second-class passengers paid fares &lt;£8,9.13,917 The third-class paid 6,432,064 Excess paid by first and second-class ^2,481,853 The numbers of third-class were about 69 mil lions in excess. Although I calculate 56 more third-class in a train than in a first-class, they would require over 300,000 trains beyond those employed for first and second-class. Mr. Haughton says truly that you may increase your gross take and your mileage account, but those facts do not necessarily imply a profit.17 If it sliould turn out upon inquiry that it costs so much a head to haul a train full of third-class passengers, the above comparison is of importance. The average of Pares in 1867 was, first-class, 2s. 6d.; second. Is. Sfd.; and third-class, 8^d. Making up a train of 78 persons, without season tickets, there would be,— i * x Per head. Expenses.

Perhaps S^d. would be too small a charge : a train of 73 third-class, without first or second, would not pay to get 2s. 8d. a mile run for total expenses, and a profit. If third-class trains travel slowly, then the time of the employes, and the locomotives and coke consumed, all count against it. The locomotive might be hauling another train in the time thus lost. It would not pay to cut out the first-class B18 cftrrifig'P, 3iS tlic niiiG pftSSGiigcrs \\ on Id go SGcond, and so would sevGral sgrsoii ticket holdeis. TI ig nino passongers pay 10s. l(Hd. morG than nine second would. The weight of tliG passengers would still exist, and 10s. lOkl. is very good pay for hauling eight tons, the weight of the carriage, a distance of nineteen miles, as against the price paid for minerals. Before the extension of traffic (through dimi nished charges) is looked to as a source from which we are to derive advantages, it will he neces sary to admit that we thoroughly understand the handling of the enormous weights which are annually added to the work our railway officials are called upon to deal with, and not only so, but the conditions upon which they can be handled. We are permitted to have an insight into the peculiar working of great increase of traffic with out going through the ordeal of fencing with new schemes for cheaper Fares, which, if adopted, might cause great inconvenience, disorganize the present system, and end perhaps in disappointment by again raising the Fares to the old standard. The figures appear to have fought out the ques tion already, and to rather a bitter end. Could we have been supplied with the following data in 1849 in advance of the facts, we should one and all have pronounced an opinion in favour of a ten per cent, dividend. The net earnings, however, are not up to 4 per cent. We can indeed increase our receipts and multiply our mileage account, but not necessarily profits in the same ratio. They19 say facts are stubborn things. We had 6,032 miles open in 1849, costing an average of ^38,088 per mile. In the face of the construction of Metropolitan Railways, the cost per mile has been reduced to ,£35,113 on 14,247 miles open in 1867. (This says something for the science, I should imagine.) In the period named, the passengers have more than quadrupled, and so has the take upon goods. Goods....£5,528,606 Goods £21,554,365 The take per train mile in 1852 was 5s. 2d. ; in 1867 it was 5s. 3|d. It has never been down to 5s., and never up to 6s. If we inquire why the take per train mile has not gone up in propor tion to the figures given, the answer is that trains are added pari passu with the work Railways have to perform. In 1852, £100 was brought to the Railways in the following proportions :— Passengers 53-17 Goods 46*83 Notwithstanding that the passengers have more than quadrupled in 1867, the proportions were,— Passengers 45-43 Goods 54-57 Fares do not multiply in rnoneij as do goods. A ton is always a ton ; but when 300 millions of Passengers in 1849. Passengers in 1867- 68,841,539 £6,277,892 287,688,113 £17,935,63420 passengers average one lialtpeuny less each year, it tells upon the ton of passengers, ihe Metro- politan Railways dilute our averages; even third- class in 1864 were at 9id., and now they are 8|d. (in 1867) In 1819, Railways had £1,957 take against acost of &lt;£38,088 -in 1867 ^2,770 against a cost of ^35,113 per mile. Where shall we look for an answer to the ques tion, How have you spent the money ? The goods and passengers multiply, and the average cost of a mile of Railway is lessened. The take per train mile varies little in its average ; ergo, the answer is, that the trains have kept pace on the debit side of the account. The public send more traffic ; the Companies supply more trains. I append eight years' net profits and expenditure. The lowest working charges were 47 per cent., the highest 50 per cent., in 1867. 3,814 miles have been added in those years. The net take in 1860 equalled i:l,397 per mile open. The increase amounts upon the additional mileage to only ^1,323 per mile. Starting with a considerable sum in favour of net revenue in 1860, it narrows until the outlay for expenses surpasses the net profits. Passenger trains on 19 miles would expend, at 2s. 8d. a mile, .£2. 10s. 8d., and goods trains £4. 2s. on 30f miles. Can we lower that rate oi expenditure, or can we raise the take per mile run, if we lower the Fares ? Adding more weight to the trains will not accomplish the first; additional traffic added to the present trains at the old rates for Fares would bring about the second; but at21 reduced Fares I have already suggested difficulties. Would the public be satisfied with the same number of trains in the year 1870 as in 18G9, plus the inconvenience of the additional passengers ? If they be willing, will the law of averages prevent our gaining in the attempt ? Since the year 1849 our money receipts have more than trebled, the average cost of construction cheapened by c £3,000 a mile, but our mileage only made from 6,032 into 14,247. In the face of these facts, I quite expect the Engineer with ' things as they are ' will defy us to bring out a profit on our Capital of 4 per cent, if you lower the Fares. These questions are to be treated by science, and we are in the hands ol a very intelligent class, our Engineers. They can tell us much more upon these subjects than we give them credit for so soon as they shall have had time to fully discuss the new theories in vogue, judged hxj the side of the irork already done. To the general public the question of paying and non- paying weight was, until lately, a thing unknown and unheeded. When once it is assumed that the public are charged Is. for something to be acquired at 6d., it will devolve upon the Engineer to step forward (as Mr. Haughton or any others have done), and tell us how much their science can accomplish for us at a price, the conditions con sidered.I s !• 22 E ight Y ears' W ork.

These numbers include any new lines opened. The passengers increased in those three years by 58,415,948 ; and out of the above-cited additional trains, these trips brought with them over 800 thousand trains. As to dilution of fares, the increase of classes explains it:— First-class 4,024,293 Second-class 12,431,128 Third-class 41,960,527 Total 58,415,948 Any capitation scale adopted in 1864 would not hold good in 1867 if tons hauled at a price have to enter into the calculation. Suppose, for argu ment, all the passengers in 1867 had been made cheap trips by the passengers electing to go third-23 class, there would have been a difference of ^5,000,000 sterling for hauling the same number of tons of human freight. Given the cost of a third-class carriage, and its weight with 32 pas sengers riding 12| miles, and the durability of the carriage ; given also the cost of a first and second- class treated in the same way ; will not so much a head be spent in capital and haulage ? At 20 to the ton, lords pay M2. 10s., whereas 32 third-class weighing 1 ton 12 cwt. go for £1. 2s. 8d. ; or, referring to the averages, 9 first-class paid 2s. 6d., equal to &lt;£1. 2s. Gd. (there are season tickets as well to be added) ; 20 second, &lt;£1. 5s. lOd.; 44 third, £1. lis. 2d., making the train in 1867 one first-class carriage, one second, and two third. Nature, in her laws of gravity, wear, and tear, deals with lords and commoners alike. The Rail way Fares do not appear to follow her. Five tons of minerals are put into a truck of less weight. 100 passengers at 1 cwt. will weigh 5 tons, and do not weigh l-20th of the train. I suggest for consideration whether so much a head is not the method to adopt to come at the cost. A passen ger train gives 5 tons more weight when full, and the fares are in hand out of which to pay 2s. 8d. a mile expenses; when empty, 2s. 8d. a mile comes out of pocket, and the company can only have saved the haulage of 5 tons. Every third-class passenger, when a carriage is full, occupies l-32nd part of a carriage weighing 8 tons, viz., 5 cwt., his own weight is only l-5th, total 6 cwt. A first-class occupies l-24th of 824 tons nearly 7 cwt., and his own weight brings it up to nearly 8 cwt. In one case you get 8jd. for 6 cwt., in the other 2s. Cel. for less than 8 cwt. If first-class paid ll|d., they would pay the same as the third by weight. Why do they pay the other Is. 6^d. ? What can make such a differ ence ? This does not argue that 2s. 6d. is too much; it may argue that 8^d. is too little. A ton of minerals does not add its own weight in requiring its share of space in a truck; passen gers, however, claim 5 times to 7 times their weight in the scale with a carriage full. Send 82 third-class away in a train for 19 miles at 8^d. a head; the expenses, at 2s. 8d. a mile, equal ^2. 10s. 8d.; the fares come to ^2. 18s. Id. Where is the 50 per cent, for dividends ? It costs nearly 7jd. a head to send the train, and debit it with its proportion of all charges. I may not be correct in the way I have subdivided the charge per head in putting first-class at Is., second at 6|d., and third at 5^d. If anything, I may have erred in favour of third-class. To make out perfect returns of three grades of iares, the capital invested in the carriages for each class should be considered; the mainte nance and renewal of each; many more third- class carriages are always running over the me tals as compared to first. In the same way, passenger traffic is conducted with l-12th of the vehicles called into service by minerals, goods, and cattle. I now pass on to the work of the locomotive25 and its cost. The average expenditure in 1867 was ^635, and the interest of capital cost is another £150—total 785. Out of a total year's working charges in 1867 of £19,848,952, the locomotives count for £5,477,223. An average day's work is put at about two hours. Much of the idle time is perhaps accounted for by the engine of the day laying up for the night, and vice versd. If a locomotive can accomplish more than three passenger trains daily, then less than one-third of its time and outlay would appear to be fairly chargeable to each train ; if a locomotive cannot take much more than one goods train per day in the same way, a proportion must go against each train. Compare the work done in 1864 against that of 1867 ; there is a difference of £241 per locomotive in favour of 1864. 8,619 of these expensive creations cost, in capital, nearly 26 millions sterling. If we work them so as to wear them out in 14 years in lieu of 15 years, then £2,000,000 sterling counts against us. The same argument will apply to wear and tear of carriages and permanent way as the trains and weights are increased. At two hours a day, the paying time of an engine appears to be equal to 372 days and nights ; under repairs for two and a half years; resting and accomplishing unknown services 11 years. I must confess to a desire to see it haul more whilst we catch it in harness. It is something to know that 68 miles run with passenger trains are the work of a loco motive per day, and that it consumes 30 lbs. of26 coke per mile ; whereas the day's work of a goods engine is 36 miles, with a consumption of 45 lbs. a mile. That is how I subdivide the labour of two locomotives at 52 miles each. Questions of refinement of Kailway accounts will constantly come before us. Should we suc ceed in keeping the details of goods and passen gers apart, viz., locomotives employed, and their time absorbed, capital invested in trucks, and the repairs and renewals thereof, sidings and goods sheds, cranes, weighing machines, the labour of loading and unloading, coke, oil, and payments for collecting the freight, coaching, merchandize, &amp;c., I should expect to find that goods do not bring the profit imagined. In the same way I shall expect to find that, when the chief of our Kailway Companies shall have decided and defined upon what principle a man is to be dealt with, weighing a cwt., and as a third-class passenger calling for 5 cwt. as his share of carriage even when it is full, that this traffic is not so remunerative as it would appear in the bulk of money taken. Mr. Haughton deals with a man as two tons, including engine, tender, and breaks. The ' Quarterly Keview' puts 14 to the ton, simply dealing with the passengers and their luggage. The third - class do not object to packing closely, and rarely have lug gage. Calling each person by his own weight of 1 cwt., a train of 7 first-class carriages would weigh 56 tons, the passengers at 24 to a carriage 8 tons 8 cwt., and they would pay £21 for 64 tons27 8 cwt.; 7 third-class carriages, with 32 persons in each, would weigh 67 tons 4 cwt., and pay Ml. 10s. 4d. Not much more than one-third. If we have ever to consider the question of making up trains in classes, these comparisons will have to be made. If 50 per cent, of the money brought by passenger trains in 1867 be divided by the trains despatched, £2. 8s. a train was the cost. 73 persons (the average without season tickets) at S^d. will bring £2, lis. 8kl. When we know the numbers of trains carrying first, second, and third- class carriages, and how many of each class the Railways possess, we shall get at the various vacant spaces for a practical end. We have seen enough in the foregoing figures to conclude that, if the passenger traffic could be equally distributed throughout the day and night, carriages equal to 1,670,914 trains could have been dispensed with, if they could be put temporarily out of the way. No such remedy is at hand, and the population of the United Kingdom is not likely to change its habits and customs to help the Rail ways. Imagine a change of Fares bringing about an ave rage of even 9^d. (just one halfpenny a mile upon the passenger train run), the receipts would show ^11,387,650 against .£15,347,081 taken—a deficit of JC3,959,431, the Railways meantime having hauled one-third more weight of living freight, 73 persons going the whole journey of 19 miles, bringing a comparative loss of nearly ^64,000,000. The third-class Fares are higher than they appear,-Mm 28 because of the Metropolitan averages. The Metro politan Kaihvay had over 22 millions of passengers, averaging perhaps only 2kl. In 1864 the passenger trains averaged over 21^ miles. If the trains came down to an average of 13 miles, it would look as if there were no loss of vacant space. Another million of Metropolitan trains going only four miles would pull down the average to 1G miles ; that would be no proof that trunk lines had added three miles to the paying side. We must depend upon the Board of Trade for the perfecting of the year's returns. If one year be treated carefully and specially in a certain way, we could do much. The year 1870 might be so dealt with. The suggestions are too numerous to refer to now. Time in a commercial country like England counts for money. I have no faith in lower Fares filling long journey trains ; it would necessitate an extension of travellers who had time. It is stated that 30 years ago the charge by stage coach averaged 5d. a mile; you can now go for less than three halfpence, with a choice of hour and a great saving in time. It is not surprising that the third-class show the great proportion of travellers. For every man who pays ,£1,000 a year for rent, there would be £100,000 coming from 1,000 at £100 each, and so on downwards. If there be only 100 poor men to every rich man, given that a certain proportion travel in the pursuit of their calling, or in reach ing their homes, the increase will go on uponIi MW—WBE— 29 the basis upon wliicli we start. The increase of passengers in the year 1866 exceeded 22 mil lions. Ten companies, however, out of the many hun dreds we have, can nearly account for it all. The Metropolitan and North London together show over ten millions; the London and Brighton, and London Chatham and Dover, nearly four millions ; the London and North Western, Lancashire and Yorkshire, Great Western, and Midland, over six millions ; the South Eastern and Great Northern, more than a million and a half. Thus the great centres show nearly all the increase. The Metro politan Kailway, in 1867, had an average of 165 per train, but even that number will not suffice to pay a good dividend on their capital with 368 trains a day; that is a dividend which many other Railways pay, but then their Fares are diluted down to an average of 2^d. (These numbers are exclusive of season tickets.) The cost per train mile run is 2s. 8d., that is to say, all charges considered. Id. saved would be of great service to the Companies, and would equal Is. 7d. upon every train of 19 miles average. It would, however, accomplish little towards a dimi nution of Fares, when shared by 82 passengers. This penny is a large per-centage to save, as it amounts to between 6 and 7 per cent, upon the running expenses, and more than 3 per cent, upon all charges. Before any profit could be calculated on, a sum of £100 had to be deducted in 1867 for certainurn* 30 charges, the per - centages 11 which are here Maintenance of Way, &amp;c. ...

Fellow Countrymen,— The railways of England have practically superseded the highway8 of Eng land. The highways are free and give equal rights to every man; the railways are a monopoly and with hold the rights of the middle classes and the poor. PARLIAMENT from time to time has spoken with authority to the monopolists and made them yield a portion of your rights, and holds in its hands the power to reclaim the rest. THE QUEEN has spoken, and appointed her commission— ' To provide for securing the safe, ex- ' peditious, punctual, and cheap transit ' of passengers and merchandise upon ' the said Railways with as near an ' approach as may jbe to uniformity ' of charge and equality of treatment ' for all persons under similar circum- ' stances.'— {Reportp. 6.) HER COMMISSIONERS have well performed their duty. They have examined the matter with un wearied care and diligence and report as follows:— 'It is obvious that whilst the first- ' class long-distance passenger traffic ' is probably better provided for in ' this country than anywhere else in '' the world, the working-classes do u not obtain that benefit from railway u communication by the ordinary ' trains of the companies which a ' railway is so well calculated to af- ' ford.'— (Reportp. 61.) — I MIV The following signatures are affixed to this report:— ' Devonshire. ' Belmore. a E. F. Leveson Gower. ' Rol3ert Lowe. ' Thomas B. Horsfall. u Robert Dalglish. ' Geo. Carr Glyn. u Acton S. Ayrton. u Douglas Galton. u Edwd. Hamilton. ' J. R. McClean.' The Right Hon. W. Monsell and Sir Rowland Hill make separate reports to express their views. Mr. Monsell (for Ireland) says— ' An act of Parliament should be in- u troduced for the purchase of the ' Irish railways. The labouring classes, u debarred by their poverty from the ' use of railways at high fares, would, ' perhaps, in a poor country thickly ' but unequally populated, be the ' principal gainers * * * * In Ireland ' experience proves that large profits ' may be accumulated from the shil- u lings of the poor.'—104-5.) Sir Rowland Hill (for Great Britain) says— u Experience has now shown that rail- ' ways are essentially monopolies; con- u sequently they are, in my opinion, ' not suitable objects for ordinary com- u mercial enterprise . . . they cannot u be advantageously left to indepen- ' dent companies . . . they should u be in the hands of Government.'— {Report p. 110.) 'Hputti] 'm ihoThe Queen and the Parliament so far have done their duty and are ready still to do it. What have you done in your own behalf? NOTHING ! Have you petitioned Parliament ? NO!. Charles Edward Stewart, Esq., was for near twenty years secretary to the London and North Western Railway Company up to the beginning of 1866. He was examined at great length by the commission, and gave evidence as follows :— ' On the 12th and 13th of September 1861, ' which I believe may be taken as a fair average, 'there were booked at Euston 4,482 passengers, ' and for the accommodation of those passengers u there were sent away trains containing seats for ' 13,512 passengers. 14.822. a (Sir R. Hill.) That is about three seats ' for every passenger ?—Yes ; that is what they a do now without any compulsion. 14.823. u Were their reserved seats intended for u any expected access of traffic after the train left u Euston?—No; it arose from the attempt to send u through carriages to so many towns. Then, with u regard to the up traffic on those two days, 4,336^ ' passengers arrived at Euston, and there was space u provided in those trains for 13,333 passengers. 14.824. u Was there anything peculiar in those ' days which rendered that an unusual proportion 'of passengers to seats?—No, that is a fair ave- ' rage. 14.825. . The number of people accommodated ' by putting on and taking off through carriages 'from those trains was 179, and to accommodate 'those 179 pei'sons there were additional seats for ' 1,274 put on. Now, granting it was an accom- ' modation to the 179, it had the effect of incon- ' veniencing the 4,000; I believe the attempt to ' further convenience a few people produces a muchvi 4&lt; larger amount of inconvenience to the many, and ' that we are doing too much in the direction of ' attempting to send through carriages. 14.832. ' Then it would appear as though you u were of opinion that if the trains can be made ' proportionate to the number of passengers, so that ' there should be little or no waste of room, the cost ' of conveying passengers might be very largely u reduced?—1 think that the cost of conveying 11 passengers would be very largely reduced, and also ' the punctuality of the trains would be increased, if ' some mode of that kind could be adopted. For ' instance, you set off now with an unwieldy train, ' consisting of 25 or 30 carriages, when 10 or 15 11 would suffice. 14.833. ' I suppose, in point of fact, that the cost ' of conveying empty carriages is nearly as great 'as the cost of conveying full carriages?—Very ' nearly. 14.834. 'And therefore the cost of running the ' trains of which you speak would not have been u very materially enhanced had the number of pas- ' sengers been three times as great as it really was ?— 'Not much ; of course if passengers have a quantity ' of luggage that makes a difference. 14,837. ' (Lord Stanley.) In fact it comes to this, ' does it not, that a passenger who has taken afirst- ' class place, unless there is a very unusual number ' of passengers, thinks himself aggrieved if he has ' only his own seat?—Yes; and then if he wishes '' to smoke he fees the porter to lock him up. 14.839. '(Sir R. Hill.) But that waste would be '' avoided if the passengers were willing to leave the ' carriages on the main line, and step into carriages ' on the branch line ?—Yes. 14.840. ' (Chairman.) Do you find an unwilling- ' ness on the part of passengers to changing car- 'riages?—Yes; the public have been spoilt, but I ' believe, if they really consulted their own interestVll ' with regard to punctuality, that they had better 11 submit to a little inconvenience at the junctions u than suffer the delay which necessarily arises from ' the present system, first of all having their carriage ' taken off and added to another train, and thentf ' they are in a heavy train of 25 or 26 carriages it ' does not keep its time.'* THAT is the treatment of the eleven per cent, the first-class passenger on English railways. In 1843 open trucks, some without seats, were used to cairy thud-class passengers on many English railways, and that is the amount of convenience, probably, which would be provided for them now! but for THE DIRECT INTERFERENCE OF PARLIAMENT. The third-class passenger is privileged (!) once a day to travel on a railway for a penny a mile, and this privilege he only obtained through THE DIRECT INTERFERENCE OF PARLIAMENT. The third-class passenger is carried only by the slowest moving trains. His train is shunted to a siding, like a goods train, and there he is detained sometimes for hours together, in the winter-time shivering with cold, often without a glimmer of light to cheer him. The stage-coach on which he used to get a lift with a cheerful greeting from the coachman and the guard has been driven from the road and the rail way substituted, where the third-class passenger is despised by the money-taker, snubbed by the porter, and looked upon as an intruder and an encum brance by the railway director. THIS is the treatment of the sixty-two per cent. —the third-class passenger on English railways. * Royal Commission—Minutes of Evidence, pp. 693-4.1 1 pv'r/ Ik Yin The third-class passenger looks abroad to see how railway travellers are treated there; and lo ! in Ger many he finds the first-class passenger is carried with all needful comfort for less than the third-class passenger pays here. In Belgium he sees the third-class pas senger carried for less than a farthing a mile ; provided with comfortable accommodation hy the express trains; treated like a friend and thought worthy to be con sidered, cared for and respected. Why not here ? For want of THE DIRECT INTERFERENCE OP PARLIAMENT. Is it not time then to call out lustily u something must be done'? Fellow-countrymen, the railways are our own whenever we choose to pay for them; and we have abundant means of doing so. We have a Prime Minister willing and able to help us: he was the author of that u direct interference of Parlia ment' 1 through which already small privileges have been granted to you. We have the Reports ol the Royal Commission on Railways describing the nature and extent of our malady, and partially suggesting a cure. Let us put our own shoulders to the wheel and complete the cure. Let us apply plentifully the Englishman's best plaster to the wound— THE PETITION TO PARLIAMENT— from every quarter of the empire. Let lis thereby strengthen the hands of our parliamentary physicians. Let us consent no longer to follow tardily in the wake of railway civilization as practised all around us. But let us, the inventors of the railway system, take the lead as we ought to do, and act as becomes the inhabitants of the foremost country in the world. G. W. J ones. 25, Essex Street, Strand.*'**** UNIVERSAL 'S tk ikiihr, kfe penny railways. ^ Wliyiotb • ' S omething must be done.' One of the most im portant epochs in the life of an Englishman and in the history of his country, is, when he, as a man, or the country, as a nation, arrives at the conclusion, u something must be done.' It is his first halting- place. It is the first turnpike he arrives at on his way to do well. He has just paid the toll, and a very heavy one it was, and he asks the tollman which way he shall turn, for he has come a long way at a very great expense, and begins to think he lias taken the wrong road? Tollman says 'he can't advise him: he'll find many troublesome toll-collectors* and expensive gates that way, he knows, but where the road leads to and what the traveller will discover at the end of it he really can not say. He thinks it would be safer to try another way !' By this observation the Englishman is set a- thinking. He never thinks at starting. He always takes the bright side of the road and goes ahead at a dashing pace until he meets with a disaster. A sprained ankle, a black eye, or an empty purse at once brings him to his senses, and he begins seriously to think a something must be done.' In this manner he always gets into a labyrinth at first, but he always finds the way out of it, triumphantlv. It was so in the Crimean war. He sacrificed thou sands of lives and millions of treasure before he sat * Tax-c jllcctore. B2 down convinced that 'something must be done.' But having arrived at that point, it was done and he came out of it with honour. So with railways: the Englishman has spent five hundred millions sterling upon railways ! * One-third of it thrown away or wasted. He now sees many of his rail ways bankrupt or falling into disuse; f and whilst he invented them and was the first to utilize them he sees the construction of them a prize to his neigh bours and to* himself a blank. But now he says 'something must be done;' and it will be done: and the time is not far distant when the railways of England and Scotland—ay, and of Ireland—will produce more extensively' that reward to which the Country of the inventor is especially entitled than •can be looked for by its neighbours; unless, indeed, in addition to availing themselves of the invention, they likewise adopt the English mode of working it. In the year 1865, just forty years after the first railway for the conveyance of passengers and goods by steam power was conceived, the ruinous state of railway property produced the conviction that the railways of Great Britain were not performing their functions as they ought to do, to the advantage of their proprietors and of the country at large. ' It u was deemed expedient/' therefore, ' that a Com- ' mission should forthwith issue for Inquiry into ' the charges now and heretofore made for con- ' veyance on the several Railways of Great Britain u and Ireland, and whether it would be practicable ' to effect any considerable reduction in such charges, u and to report their opinion, whether it would heprac- u tic able, hy means of any changes in the laws relating u to Railways or otherwise, to effect a more convenient u interchange of traffic, and more economical arrange- u ments for the ivorking of railways, so as to make any 11 considerable reduction in the costs of conveyance, and in the * Commissioners' Eeport, p. 28. f Commissioners' Eeport, p. 93.'' charges to the public on account thereof;'* and a Royal •commission was appointed accordingly. And the labours of the commission resulted in the produc tion of a very voluminous and most valuable col lection of statistics and evidence and a most useful Report upon the subject ;—the general report being supplemented by separate reports from two of the commissioners, the right Hon. W. Monsell and Sir Rowland Hill. But although the Commissioners collected all the materials ne cessary for arriving at the important point to which their great aim was directed— u the discovery ' of some more economical arrangement, hy which a con siderable reduction m the cost of conveyance and in the u charges to the public could be effected^ they did not succeed in discovering an exact and definite scheme by which those two great objects could be accom plished; but, at p. 7 7 of the report, they say, u it ' has already been shown that no general reduction '' in the cost of working can be expected.' It is submitted, with all respect to the commis sioners, that this decision of theirs is inconclusive; and that the present mode of working railways does admit u of a more economical arrangement, from which a great u and general reduction in the cost of working may be ex- u pec ted and that the course of proceeding by which it may be effected will be found clearly •explained in the pages of this pamphlet. It is sub mitted, further, that by the plan which the pamphlet will develop, and test by practical demonstration, the other great object also u a considerable reduction &lt;£ in the charges to the public can be effected^ without u cheapening the means of conveyance by railway at the u expense of the national exchequer^ 'j* perhaps even chiefly by a simple order of the Board of Trade requiring uniformity of practice on all the railways m the country; but certainly, in case of necessity, Ccmmi8sione^s , Report, p. 6. f Eeport, p. 36. B 24 by the exercise of the powers vested in the State by the Acts of 1844 and subsequently. It is intended to refer extensively to the reports of the commissioners, and to extract from them all the evidence necessary to affirm the perfect feasibility and practicability of the project which this pamphlet is intended to develop, namely— To exact a small toll from every passenger on entering upon a railway, and at certain points as he passes over it; the toll to vary according to the class hy which he selects to travel; and to provide him with the means of conveyance free. The arteries of communication through the coun try have been allowed to fall under the control and management of a multitude of rulers—railway directors—who most unwisely act upon the pre sumption that their interest is somewhat antago nistic to the public, and largely antagonistic to each other; and the innocent traveller is made to suffer loss in various ways, in time and monev, besides many inconveniences owing to this mis conception. In the outset the public, represented by the landowner, extorted from the company an exorbitant price for his land, and now the company retaliates by extorting from the public an exorbitant pr ice for passing over that land which was so dearly purchased. Happily it has been foreseen that this kind of antagonism was likely to arise, or, at all events that it was probable the unoffending public might be prejudiced by the unusual powers which Parliament was granting to railway companies ; and so it hap pened that, in the year 1844, an Act was passed u to attach certain conditions to the construction of future railways''' in the interest of the public. One of these conditions was that instead of open cattle-trucks with out seats or covering, which some of the companies supplied for the conveyance of third-class passengers, railway companies should provide decent carriages, which should run at least once a day each way over the whole line, and convey the public protected fromthe weather at not less than twelve miles an hour or more than a penny a mile. But a still more important condition was, that it should be lawful for the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury if they should think fit, at any time after the expiration of twenty-one years from the 1st of January, 1845, to purchase any railway which should thereafter be constructed, on terms which are therein distinctly stated. And, although 2,320 miles of railway had been sanctioned before the session of 1844, and are therefore excluded from the provisions of the Act,* and all the main lines of communication throughout England with the ex ception of the Great Northern liailway are in cluded in that list, it may fairly be presumed that the terms set forth in this Act of Parliament would gladly be accepted by every existing company. The reins, therefore, are in our own hands. It is only necessary to discover a feasible and prac ticable plan whereby the public may be mrchj benefited by appropriating to themselves the powers granted to the railway companies, and the oppor tunity is afforded them, upon terms already known, of taking under their own care and management every railway in the kingdom. Some attempts have been made tending to this end, but no plan for accomplishing the object has yet been promulgated which combines simplicity, practicahility, and equity with undoubted public utility and profit, all which are points essential to induce the State to take the cause in hand. A scheme was suggested many years ago by Mr. Gait t for the purchase of the railways by the Government and reduction of the fares to about one- third of those at present levied; and Mr. Gait gave valuable evidence upon the subject before the commission. But, speaking of his evidence. Sir * Commissioners' Report, p. 33. f ' Railway Reform,' Longman.6 Rowland Hill in his report says : a while, however^ ^ it is but right that Mr. Gait should receive all the- ' credit due to the persistency and energy with 'which he has pursued an object to which he has ' devoted much time and attention, it is to be re- ' gretted that his zeal in urging a measure so ' valuable in itself should have led him into much ' inaccuracy of statement and undue enlargement ' of expectation.' This, perhaps, is somewhat hard upon Mr. Gait, for the main principle for which he contended—namely, the reduction of fares to one-third of the rate charged by English railway companies—has since been proved not only to be practicable but - productive of much larger profit and more national benefit than the exorbitant terms which are exacted by English railway companies. Another scheme is proposed by Mr. Brandon,* who appears to have aimed at assimilating the railway traveller to the posted letter; but he fails in the attempt. He suggests a uniform charge of Is. first class, 6d. second class and 3d. third class for any distance ' existing fares below those rates remaining as at present This is as if Sir Rowland Hill had fixed a penny as the uniform postage of a letter to the country, but had left the ' twopenny post' as it existed when he took the cause in hand. The scheme has little to recommend it. Presuming^ for the argument, that the payment would be suffi cient to defray the cost of conveyance, that is not everything:—the extreme lowness of the fares, alto gether, and consequent close approximation of that for the highest and the lowest classes would alone be fatal to it: it would open the railways to the people truly; but it must deprive the higher and wealthier classes of all comfort and convenience, except for short distances, in travelling by rail. Mr. Brandon, like Mr. Gait, deserves credit ibr the persistency and energy with which he perseveres in ventilating the * Bell and Daldy.principle of a uniform charge by railways, but liis plan, if carried out, would fail in giving general satis faction. Another scheme lias been suggested by Mr. Williams, a barrister.* His book exhibits much in dustry and contains useful extracts from the report of the commissioners on Irish railways, with observations of his own which deserve attention and are calcu lated to be useful in dealing with the ' appropriation of the railways by the State.' But his scheme for a uniform rate of charge is simply a graduated charge of 4d. first class, and 2d. second class for each five miles or portion of five miles up to fifty miles, and an arbitrary charge of 5s. first class and Is. 6d. second class for any greater-distance. This, perhaps, is simpler and better than Mr. Brandon's plan, but it still falls short of the essentials before stated ; for whilst for short distances the fare is increased by gradations, a person travelling fifty miles or five hundred miles would be charged the same; that, therefore, is not equitable, or such a system as the State could be expected to adopt and carry out. In the report of the royal commission on railways the commissioners say: ' the advantages which the 'public have derived from railways in passenger 1 traffic are speed and comfort, and reduction of the £ actual cost of conveyance; the estimate of which 1 depends on the manner in which railways are £ compared with other means of conveyance.' ' The richer classes have benefited most largely ' in point of cost, because the railways enable ' them to dispense with posting. The middle ' classes have also largely benefited, it the second ' class carriage be compared with the inside of a 1 stage coach, and the third class with the outside. 1 The poorer classes have benefited most in regard^ ' to speed, because formerly they had no means of ' travelling except by waggon or on foot; conse- ( quently a person dependent on daily earnings was * Stanford.ni'iiii 1 11 8 u practically unable to pass from one part of the ' country to another.' ' The average expense of posting was 2s. a mile ' with a pair of horses, and coaching fares before ' the introduction of railways were stated by Mr ' Chajjlin, in 1838, to have been 4id. per mile in- ' S1( ie, and 2jd. per mile outside, to which the inci- u dental fees and charges would have to be added.' —Report of Commissioners, p. 53. And here also should have been noticed the fact which is of course implied, that before the power and availability of steam were understood, when railroads for the conveyance of passengers were im- known, the only means ot intercommunication be tween the Land s Lmd and John o' Groat's house was the Queen s highway—the ordinary roads and by- ways of the country. This highway was originally made at the cost of the country, and was maintained and kept m repair by tolls levied upon travellers at turnpike gates, as is still done upon that description 5 ^ad at the present day. The toll so levied was usually a \ ery small one for the poor man's donkey, moie foi the yeoman's horse, and much more for the squire s carriage; thus giving equal advantages to all) and requiring payment in proportion to the means of the contributor.* If an individual or an asso ciation of persons desired to make a road, appli cation was made to Parliament, as for a railroad; and if it could be shown that the making of such ^.was calculated to afford convenience to the public a licence was granted—an Act of Parlia ment--to levy a reasonable toll to reimburse the cost of construction and maintenance of the same, and a turnpike was set up accordingly; and every person riding or driving over it had to pay the oil. J he further a person travelled over a turn- '' ld e&lt; l ualit y of for all rVmnmoQ' t &gt; m command on appointing the Eoyal Commission on Eailways).9 'f i pike road the greater number of tolls lie had to pay. In travelling from Truro to Newcastle he had much more to pay than if his journey ended at Exeter, through which he had to pass; but that was equitable, and no one was ever heard complaining of the circumstance or requiring that it should be altered. A partial anomaly or inequality, however, could not be avoided. A space of fifteen or twenty miles, perhaps, intervened between two turnpike gates, and one traveller would drive over the whole length from one turnpike to another before he paid the toll; whilst another person lived a few yards only from the tollgate, and this one had to pay the toll before he had travelled half a mile along the road. The anomaly, however, had this advantage—it gave John Bull an occasion for a grumble without much cause, and so contributed to his contentment and happiness. The facts propounded in the preceding paragraph are so well known and understood that it may seem superfluous to have related them; but the main prin ciple to be recommended for adoption is comprised in the application of turnpikes or barriers to railroads throughout the kingdom; and it was thought use ful, therefore, to call to mind the exact operation of taking toll upon the Queen's highways before laying the intended scheme before the reader. It is intended to show by evidence deduced almost entirely from the reports of the commis sioners on railways themselves, that the plan about to be explained contains the essential principles, and is calculated to perform the declared objects for the discovery and enunciation of which the Com mission was appointed—namely, u the practicability, u by means of a change in the Urns relating to railways, u to effect more economical arrangements for the working 11 of railways, so as to make a considerable reduction u m the costs of conveyance and in the charges to the u public on account thereof' And in order that the10 reader may be the better able to apply the evi dence used in the reports of the commissioners in proof of the practicability of this scheme, and of the great individual and national advantage that may be expected to result from its adoption, it is intended first to explain the scheme itself, and afterwards to produce the arguments by which it is recommended. That the country should experience the full bene fit to be derived from the system, it may he necessary that the State should purchase all the railways; but it is not absolutely certain that such a course of pro ceeding will bo necessary. The railway companies may find it much more advantageous to themselves to adopt the tarilf and mode of working, of which, by adopting part only of the railway system the Government may set them the example and show them the results. But the proofs are patent through out the evidence taken by the Commissioners, that the highways of the country can hardly be satisfac torily left under the control of railway companies, however strictly the Government, by general rules, may attempt to bind them. For the argument it is desirable to assume that all the railways are the property of the State: and the reasoning which follows, therefore, is based upon that hypothesis. THE SCHEME. All the main lines running east, west, north, and south from London shall be trunk lines ; and on each of them at the most convenient positions and averaging about sixteen miles apart, a turnpike or stop station will be erected (Dublin of course will stand in the same relation to the Irish railways as London to the English, Welsh, and Scotch). Every passenger, at starting, will pay one penny (or 3d. second class, or 6d. first class), and for that payment he will be conveyed as far as the first turnpike or11 stop station f alighting at any intermediate station) on the trunk line. If the passenger proceeds beyond the turnpike or stop station he has to pay again (the same toll, Id. or 3d. or 6d.), and pursues his journey ■ to the next turnpike or stop station, with the right of leaving the train at any intermediate station ; and so on'throughout the entire length of the trunk line. At every branch from the trunk line where to proceed upon such branch line a change of carriages takes place a fresh toll of Id. (or 3d. or 6d. second and first class) shall be paid ; and the passenger from that point can proceed as far as the first turnpike or stop station on such branch line without further pay ment (alighting at any intermediate station). Here he pays again ; and so on until he arrives at his jour ney's end. The average distance between the turnpikes on the branch lines will bo the same as on the trunk lines, convenience being the only guide as to where they shall be placed. In this manner the railways of the present day will be assimilated to the Queen's highways of the past, but with this difference in favour of the traveller, that, whereas in times pa§t he had to find his own conveyance, the country or the company now provides one for him in which, having paid the toll, he may travel from one end of the country to the other through all the mazes and intricacies of the railway system without the cost of a bait for a horse or a fee to guard or coachman. Much inconvenience, delay, and expense to railway companies are occasioned by printing, issuing, col lecting, and assorting the tickets issued to passengers, and apportioning the fare of each passenger who travels over more than one company's line between the various companies in proportion to the distance he has passed over each. Sometimes the fare will have to be divided proportionately between three, four, or more companies ; and the labour and expense12 of doing this and keeping the accounts it occasions cannot be readily imagined. One of the metropoli tan railway companies employs thirty-four hands and a superintendent to assort and arrange their tickets, to cancel those which have not been cut or obliterated and to nullify and destroy ready for sale as waste those which it is not necessary to keep for future reference. In the scheme under considera tion by far the greater part of this expense will be entirely avoided. The railways being all in the hands of the Go vernment the assorting of tickets and apportioning parts of the fare received between several interests will j of course, be rendered nugatory. But, assuming that part of the railways remain in the hands of the companies, it will not be necessary to receive the passenger-toll for any distance beyond the limits of their own line, or trust as it is called upon the ordinary turnpike roads. At the end of their line as a matter of necessity a turnpike or stop station will be erected. Those who take tickets can book to the extremity of the line or trust upon which they arc entering, but no farther. That will avoid all the expense of assorting and apportionment. But that is only a small part of the saving intended to be effected. Two-thirds (G2-100) of all who travel by railway in England are third-class passengers ana to them it is intended no tickets shall be issued. A turnstile (as used for foot-passengers at the pay -bridges in London and at the Crystal Palace) will be erected at every station, and through it the third-class pas sengers will pass on going to the train, paying a penny toll to the money-taker, and the turnstile will register the number who pass through. At every turnpike or stop-station the third-class passenger will have to leave the train; if he desires to go on further he will pass into the ' on -room' to be provided for the purpose at each stop- station, there he will pay a penny to the money -taker, pass13 through the turnstile and resume his place in the carriage; and the turnstile at every station will register the number of such payments. No toll will be taken for a third-class passenger for any distance beyond the nearest turnpike or stop-station to the station at which he joins the train. For every payment he makes he can travel to the next turnpike or stop-station on the line, or any in termediate station, and so on to the extremity of the kingdom paying one penny at every turnpike through which he passes. By requiring the third-class passenger to leave the carnage at every stop-station the number of car riages required to carry the passengers from each stop-station will be known, and can be added to or reduced according to such requirement; passengers can be closer packed, and the wear and tear of superfluous carriages will be avoided.* Second and first-class passengers will pay the fare and receive a ticket as at present; they also can pay at starting to any stop-station on the trunk line and thereby avoid leaving the carriage; alighting, of course, and leaving the railway at any station inter mediate between that at which they pay the fare and the stop-station they have paid to. All tickets will be issued to a stop-station, and not to the par ticular station at which the passenger may desire to alight:—this, also, will simplify and save expense in printing and arranging the tickets for delivery to passengers and labour in assorting them. A condition will be affixed to the ticket of the second-class passenger that, if required to do so, he shall change the seat he occupies and take another in a carriage better tilled, with a view of avoiding the expense of running half-filled or nearly empty car riages. This condition may seldom be acted upon, but it will make a useful distinction between pas sengers of the first and second class. * Questions 14,821 et seq. Eoyal Com., Min. of Evidence.14 On entering a branch line a fresh ticket must be taken as is done at a turnpike gate on entering upon a fresh trust; but here, again, first and second class passengers can pay to the furthest stop-station on such branch line. Each passenger, without distinction of class, will be privileged to take free in the carriage he rides in a carpet-bag or other unobjectionable luggage not exceeding 56 lbs. weight. All further luggage taken by the same train must be paid for at the rate of Id. per cwt., or portion of a cwt., for each turnpike or stop-station it will pass through to its destination,—a first payment of Id. per^ cwt. to be made in behalf of the station at which it is placed upon the truck. Extra luggage of the u people's class,' as well as of the other classes, will be paid for at starting to its destination. (It is not intended here to enter upon the great question of the carriage of goods by railway, but it may be incidentally observed that great sim plicity may be effected in the charges, and much economy in keeping the accounts between com panies, by adopting the turnpike system in lieu of the present mileage system of charges.) The names by which the ' classes ' of passengers are distinguished will be altered. Instead ol ' third class,' a second class,' and u first class,' the classes are to be distinguished as 'people's class,' 'middle class,' and 'first class.' The 'universal penny railway' is intended for 11 the people :'—for those to whom the difference between Id. and 3d. is truly a matter of consideration; who will feel it no degra dation to pass through the turnstile at each stop- station instead of paying treble to receive a ticket. 'One of the people's' condition is known and he can have no object in hiding it. The economy he will evince by travelling as cheaply as he can will not only be no disgrace but be a credit to him. The ' middle class ' passenger will take his ticket ■.ffilltib* 15 and ride in the carriage intended for him; and, ■without assuming a higher grade than his position warrants will not demean himself by a forced asso ciation with those whose position is far more humble than his own. The toll or fare payable by the middle-class passenger is so small 'that it would de grade him to avail himself of the cheaper class of conveyance, which was not intended for him. The u first-class passenger' will naturally betake himself to that class carriage in which he will be likely to meet associates of his own position in society. The 'fast trains' at double the ordinary fares he will select from preference, and, when the fares are so low a much larger proportion than at present will follow his example—always travel first class, and as often as possible select the u fast trains ' to travel by. Thus a considerable augmentation in the proportion of first and middle class passengers may be expected. Turnpikes for the most part are placed in the suburbs of a town or city, whereby the traveller is caught before he enters it or as he is leaving it; and it might perhaps have been productive of a few additional payments if the stop-stations had been placed three or four miles out of a town instead of in the heart of it. A passenger would have had to pay another toll for the short distance he had to go to reach the town, or on leaving it for the short distance he had travelled on the line; but it is wholly unnecessary to resort to any such unworthy means to increase the receipts. Let the study be to adopt those places for stop-stations which are best calculated to increase the comfort and con venience and save the time and labour of the traveller, and so render the railroad to him in every way attractive and commodious. To this end the places selected for stop-stations will always be at the existing stations in large towns or at a junction of lines. At every stop-station sidings16 will be provided for shunting the ordinary trains so that during the time required for the people's class to leave their carriages, pay the toll, and re sume their seats the opportunity may be afforded for fast trains to pass. Fast trains will run fre quently along the trunk lines:—probably every third train, if not every alternate train, will be a fast train. Fast trains will convey only first-class and middle- class passengers, at double the ordinary fares and at nearly twice the speed; and as the fares even by the fast trains- will be low, it may be fairly pre sumed they will be patronised extensively, and for long journeys to a very great extent. No fast trains will be run on the Metropolitan or such like railways, nor will turnpikes or stop- stations be erected on them ; and, with rare ex- coptions, stop-stations will not be set up on any line the entire length of which is less than twenty miles. Upon these lines the ' people's class' will pay a penny at the turnstile of any station; the middle- class and first-class passengers 3d. and 6d. each respectively and take their tickets, which payment will frank each passenger to the farthest or any other station on the line. In the case of the u Metropolitan Railway,' for example, when the inner circle is completed one payment will frank the passenger from the station at which he enters round to that station again, with the right of alighting at any other station that better suits his purpose. I pon a short railway but of greater length than the average distance between the turnpikes or stop stations (15 or 16 miles), and having important towns in its route, some town of importance that will as nearly bisect the distance as possible will be chosen for the erection of the turnpike or stop-station, l ake, for example, the railway from Manchester to Liverpool. The stop-station will be at Newton•-pro I ii; wbieli W- r 1 17 Junction; and upon such railways and in such populous neighbourhoods fast trains will run fre quently, carrying middle-class and first-class pas sengers only and at double the ordinary fares. Although, as has been said, it will probably be found impracticable to work the railways harmo niously in joint connexion with the existing railway companies—and this seems to be the opinion of several of the Commissioners, among them Sir Rowland Hill, who strongly advocates the purchase of all the railways by the State*—yet, if it can be done, it seems desirable not to disturb so large an interest as 500,000,000 sterling of investments. Under any circumstances it appears to be generally understood that an exceptional mode of dealing is not only permissible, but indispensable, in the case of the Irish railways. Mr. Monsell's separate report is designed ernressly to show that whatever be done regarding English and Scotch railways the Irish railways should be purchased and worked by the Government; and estimates are given of the price at which the whole of them could be so purchased; £22,000,000 being the sum stated, the expenditure upon the lines having been £26,395,100. In order to test the practicability and advan tages to be derived from the adoption of the plan now under consideration, it is proposed that the Irish railways be purchased by the State ; and that the trunk line from London to Crewe and Holyhead, the direct communication from London to the Irish railways, be also purchased and worked upon the plan herein described : and, it is further proposed that the trunk line of the Great Northern Railway from London to York and on to Newcastle and Edinburgh be also purchased and worked by the State in like manner. The present proprietors of all the branch railways in England, Wales, and Scotland, springing from or * Commissioners' Eeport, p. 1 22, C18 into these two trunk lines will be required to work them on this plan; and such proprietors will be guaranteed, while working such branch lines to the satisfaction of the Government, a minimum divi dend equal to the average dividend earned by them during the last three years; any surplus earned to be divided in moieties between the Companies severally, and the State. The plan could not be satisfactorily tested upon a short railway or upon a small scale. The extent of test proposed, although likely to be less productive than when all the railways in the country shall adopt the system—when everybody will travel whether he has occasion to do so or not—will at all events give the project a fair trial. To conclude, and in further illustration, it will be interesting and instructive as regards the method now submitted for working the railway system to set out the two lines which it is proposed the State should purchase in addition to the Irish railways, namely, that from London to Holyhead and that from London to Edinburgh; showing the places at which turnpikes or stop-stations will be erected, and the amount of toll or fare that will be payable from London and between all stations on these two respective lines. And, as all-important, tending so extensively as it must do to promote the pros perity oi Ireland by making the inhabitants of Dublin and London more intimately known to and interested in each other, take in the first place under review the line fromMiles.

Gearwen Holyhead Every ordinary train will run carriages for the ' people's class.' Fast trains will carry only u middle class' and ' first-class ' passengers.

They were known as the Flower boats, being called after the names of flowers. Nine c 2NBUEQB, W8E5GEBS, ^Trub,. tddle lit V'Lii ass. Ckss C® ; d.

Return tickets, with a week's grace allowed, will be issued only by the fast trains, and at the usual reduction of 25 per cent. Excursion trains at reduced fares will be entirely done away with : but arrangements can of course be made for extraordinary occasions, such as reviews or matters of national rejoicing. (N.B.—The scheme as above described may still, perhaps, admit of a further concession to the u people's class.' The payments from first and middle class passengers according to the scale proposed, with one payment of a penny from the u people's class joining the Railway, and one penny on changing to a Branch line, would be quite sufficiently remunerative in a pecuniary point of view, as will be shown here after ; and the people's class might be carried any distance along a trunk line (say from London to Inverness) without further payment. This would render ' universal penny railways ' as cosmopolitan, perhaps, as possible; certainly as much so as would he compatible with the comfort and convenience of all the classes; and is a point that may be worthy of con sideration.) Such is an outline of the system proposed for adoption; and if one question can be satisfactorily answered it seems difficult to discover an objection to the scheme. By the adoption of this plan all classes must be benefited. The benefit to the poorer class, already two-thirds of all the railway travellers, is such as could not fail to be felt by them and ap preciated ; it is so self-evident as to make any com-22 ment upon it superfluous. To the middle-class, or second-class passenger, the numerous facilities it will afford him in his business, not to name the other thousand ways in which he may experience pleasure and advantage from it, are simply inconceivable. The landed proprietor, the first-class passenger—can there be a doubt of the vast amount of benefit that must accrue to him from the increased facilities it will afford of access between his estates and the nearest market-towns ? The amount of saving it will afford to every one w r ill be equal to his income-tax, be that what it may, for everybody travels more or less, and with this scheme adopted will travel infinitely more than heretofore; and the life and activity it will impart to commerce must render it of infinite advantage to the State. What then is to prevent its being carried out ? What is that important question which requires to be solved before these great, these magnificent objects may be attained? Simply, W ill it pay? There is nothing connected w r ith the scheme that can be approached with greater confidence than this, or be made more self-evident and intelligible. The proofs that it w r i]] pay are numerous and convincing. The evidence is taken from the highest and indubi table authority: the members of the Royal Com mission on Railways are themselves the witnesses, and their testimony has been given after the most full and searching investigation. Fhere are institutions and individuals also that understand the value of a penny. The Pope under stands it. r J he man who introduced into Railway Acts the compulsory clause that the poor man should be carried decently for a penny a mile understands it. He who made the penny receipt stamp uni versal, and makes everybody pay a penny to government when he draws a cheque upon his banker understands it. The man who conceived thetwmm name i, UltKSi- iferii' 23 penny postage understands it. Tlie steamboat company that carries passengers from London Bridge to Westminster for a penny understands it. The poor man who subscribes a penny a week to have a goose at Christmas understands it. But the 2,400 railway directors — whose pardon is in voked for naming them in contiguity with the goose—cannot understand it. In the year 1865 nearly 3,000,000 tons of coals were carried from the North of England to London at three-eighths of a 'penny per ton per mile, and the trucks were conveyed back empty for nothing; and the report of the Royal Commission on Railways (fol. 69, par, 146) says ' it is shown that the peofit obtained u from a waggon fully loaded is very consider- u able .' A ton of coals nearly three miles for a penny and take back the empty trucks for nothing! A weight equal to twenty ordinary full-grown third- class passengers carried nearly three miles for a penny! or, one passenger nearly sixty miles for a penny ! (whilst the cost per train mile of carrying goods is greater than the cost of carrying passen gers*) and the profit on doing it is very consider able . It is so considerable, that in this manner the railway companies realized by the carriage of goods alone in the year 1867, £21,544,365. And the total working expenses of all the railways in the kingdom for carrying all the passengers as well as all the goods were £19,848,952 !—including very handsome salaries to these 2,400 directors,^ including £853,041 rates and taxes, £477,707 government duty, £513,668 compensation for injuries to persons and goods, £343,525 legal and parliamentary expenses, and £1,155,082 miscellaneous charges; add to these the cost * u Cost of locomotive expenses, 7 '65(1. per train mile:— 'this average may be resolved into 6'75d. per train mile for 11 passengers, and 8*5d. per train mile for goods'—Commissioners 7 Report, p. 75. f At £200 a year each it amounts to £480,000.24 maintenance of way, locomotive power, repairs and renewals and traffic charges, to make up the total of £19,848,952, and the carriage of coals upon these terms, and other merchandize, paid all these expenses, EVERY ONE OF THEM, and left a balance of £1,605,413, desides all that could he made by the carriage of passengers as that year's profits of the business. Was ever such a magnificent business carried on before? 'Was there ever such a chance given to a partnership of realizing an immense return for the capital embarked? They did carry 287,688,113 pas sengers who paid as they went, all ready money, and 119,791 season-ticket holders who paid in advance to travel over a portion of the line as often as they pleased; these passengers together paid lor being carried on the railway £17,935,634 (Her Majesty's treasury paid £572,358 for convey ing the mail-bags and the postmen.) And if the Were em P lo y ed to carry these .1UU,UUU,000 passengers had cairied six times the number the cost would have been no greater!* There were 3,924,624 trains run to carry these passengers; so * passengers only, on the average, were con veyed by each train. Each train of seven modem- buiIt carnages will seat 48 first-class, 80 second-class, and 400 third-class passengers; total, 528 (or 500, earing loom for the guard and luggage); and each engine employed is capable of exercising 400 horse- pcm ci Yv itl lout forcing, f If, therefore, seven modem- bmlt carriages had been half filled at one-third of the c laige, 13£ per cent, more money would have been received (3 times 73^=220 ; half 500=250.)

I do not pretend to scientific knowledge and shall doubtless be set down in Mr. B. Haughton's next pamphlet as one of the ' certain pamphleteers, maga zine writers, and ambulatory orators in regard to this question.-' But that imputation I can well afford to brave. I receive my light from the lamp of commer cial experience and common sense, and cannot agree with Mr. Haughton that we are 'the best served ' travelling community in the world,' whilst we- waste u nineteen tons of train-equipment to carry one ton u of passengers whilst an excess of luxurious at tention to the wealthy stands side by side with impediments of every kind to the commercial com munity ; whilst by far the largest proportionate charge is exacted from the passenger who is least able to bear it ; whilst the paying weight of a passenger train is only 4*89 per cent, of the total weight of the train, and millions of the hest paying part of the community, anxious to increase the paying weight six-fold—nay ten-fold—are debarred from doing so by excessive charges—in other words, by the blindness and imbecility of the railway director^ No ! Until a portion of the luxury lavished on the rich as a railway traveller is yielded to pro mote the prosperity of England's mainstay—the middle classes—the commercial community;—until ' the people' have their fair share of those advan tages which railways are so well calculated to afford; —until, in the words of our Queen in appointing the u commission on railways,' there be ' uniformity u of charge and equality of treatment for all persons under ' similar circumstances ;'—I cannot join with Mr. Haughton in thinking u the people ' of Great Britain are 'the best served travelling community in the ' world.'26 Mr. Ilaugliton says :— ' The railways of the United Kingdom at the present day are * l conducted by an accomplished, scientific, and highly skilled ' body of experts, who know their business, do it, and don't talk ' about it, and who, moreover, take out of the locomotive all ' they can, and present it freely and exuberantly to those whom ' it is their interest, as well as their pleasure, to accommodate— 'the travelling community; as shall presently be shown, this ' is, as the Times has lately stated, ' the best served travelling ' ' community in the world.' .... 6 ' That the public are not acquainted with these facts is I ' believe, the secret of their discontent with the management of ' our railways.

These returns disclose the ' strange facts that the average British passenger weighs two 41 tons with train accessories; .... by no known processes ' can these enormous multiplication of original net weights be ' reduced, consistent with affording that amount of personal 'security and comfort and accommodation now enjoyed.' Mr. B. Haugliton, president of the Civil and Me chanical Engineers' Society, is a great authority in all engineering matters. But, without his knowledge of engineering, I may be as capable of understanding that although 73 people in a train weigh, with the train, 143 tons, twice 73 people in the same train would not weigh 286 tons. That it would require nearly twenty times their number with all their luggage, estimated by Mr. Haughton at 2 cwt. each, to double the weight. And as each engine according to Mr. Haughton's own estimate is capable of exer cising 400 horse-power without forcing, six times as many passengers at all events, in point of numbers, and twenty times in point of weight, might be con veyed in the same number of carriages, by the same number of trains, with scarcely a perceptible increase of the cost. [Mr. Stewart, qs. 14,833 and 14,834, Minutes of Evidence, Commission on Railways.) In ordinary mercantile transactions 15 to 25 per •cent, added to the cost of an article is considered a full and fair profit for the retail dealer: 5 to 15 per cent, a noble profit for the wholesale dealer; and each of them out of this provides for bad stock and bad debts, and pays rent, taxes, wages, and every other expense incidental to his trade; and if he can only get sufficient business on these terms he rarely fails to make a fortune. But such terms are either beneath the consideration of the English and Irish railway director or beyond his comprehension. Five per cent, upon a penny! Pooh ! He will not consent to think of it. Can it be possible that the rail way director has millions of customers kicking at his door money in hand, ready to pay him 100, 200, 30028 per cent, profit if he will trade with them in pennies&gt; and still he puts his foot and his shoulder against the door and fain would keep them out ? He has the ablest counsellors in the country telling him how wrong he is, and compelling him to let some of the penny customers in, and, as it were by a species of dissolving views, laying the whole scene before his eyes, but he cannot see it! Leaving metaphor, however, let us endeavour to solve the problem for him by the simplest rule of arithmetic— that he can not fail to understand. Will it pay ? Do railway companies cany coals at three-eighths of a penny per ton per mile, send back the empty coal-trucks free, and profit considerably by the operation ? If so, the cost of working a train must be small indeed; and if all the empty trucks were filled with passengers, the cost of transit would be no greater. (Mr. Stewart, 14,833 and 14,834.) But what is the cost of working a passenger train, consisting of seven carriages and containing five hundred passengers?* The Commissioners on Railways, at page 75 of their report, supply the answer as follows :— 11 Maintenance of way .. 6- 35d.

The stop-stations or turnpikes in the proposed plan are placed on an average about sixteen miles apart. It will cost 32s., therefore, to work a pas senger train from turnpike to turnpike.

Yet how much less his wooden seat, his unlined, undecorated conveyance costs than that of his aristocratic neigh-.ii ,ir: a. hi 4 p 33 bour; how mucli less attention he requires; how much more profitable a customer he is.* But this is barely half the statement in favour of the u people's class.' There are millions of the ' people's class ' there are only thousands of the other. Millions of the u people's class' in these islands have never set foot in a railway carriage; of the other class there are but a few thousands who can be made better customers than they are already. Look, then, at the 'raw material' which the railways have got on hand imploring to be utilized. The largest and most profitable part of the great trade actually spurned, cast aside and repudiated !! Look a little further at the calculations that have been made. Two shillings a mile has been taken as the cost of working a passenger train ! Is that correct ? It was thought well to base the estimates upon that cost, lest by appearing to magnify the profit to be made by an increased trade in passen ger traffic the truth of the whole scheme might be doubted; but having done so with a very satisfactory result, it would perhaps be as well now to get a little nearer to the truth. The fact is, to carry 3,000 millions instead of 300 millions of people would scarcely make a perceptible difference in the annual expenses; and in the hands of Government, the expenses would be infinitely less to carry that larger number than they are now to carry the smaller one. It has been shown that three million # p r oportion percent, of receipts from passengers in 1867 :— 1st Class 25-01 j 2nd Class 3r02 ; 3rd Class 40'43; Season tickets 3*54.

Hear Mr. Mallet, president of the Royal Society of Engineers (fo. 98): 'At this moment on many of the lines of ' England coals are carried at a halfpenny per ton ' per mile, and pay a profit of between 200 and 300 u per cent.' Mr. Forbes (fo. 99): a Coal could be ' carried at a halfpenny per ton per mile all over Ire- ' land.' Earl of Lucan, chairman of the Irish Great N orthern and W estern Railway (fo. 101): 'All heavy ' goods should be sent at a halfpenny per ton per 'mile.' Mr. Bidder (fo. 102): 'He should carry coal ' at three-eighths of a penny per ton per mile. He ' would carry passengers by one train per day at a ' farthing per mile. Ho had no doubt you would ' have an enormous number of passengers at a far- ' thing a mile. He had a contract last year as to ' having coals in at a farthing per ton per mile. ' The stimulus that would be given to traffic by ' the lowering of the rates would be attended witli ' great advantages.' These are witnesses before the Royal Commission on Railways. Their evidence will be found in the Report at the pages marked against them. And in the opening page (Part 1.) the commissioners themselves make the following report, which, taken in reference to the present attempt—contrary to the opinion and against the will of the ruling powers—to compel a wholesale reduction in passenger fares, is singularly apt, re markable, and interesting, and most reasonably may be expected to be followed by a similar result:— 'In 1821 an Act was passed authorizing the ' construction of a railway from certain collieries near ' Darlington to the port of Stockton-on-Tees. This ' short line was destined to have an important ' influence on railway progress, as it was the first ' public line on which steam power was used for locomotion, and also the first to carry passengers. ' The Act of 1821 provided only for horse power;mmmmmmrnrnrn 35 mile, i ' but on the earnest representation, by George ' Stephenson, of the advantages that would result ' from the use of his improved steam locomotive, the u promoters resolved to give it a trial, and an u amended Act, obtained in 1823, contained a clause a giving power to work the railway by means of ' locomotive engines, and to employ them for the ' haulage of passengers, as well as merchandise. 'It is worthy of remark that in order to check 11 the use ot this line for conveying coals for shipping, 11 and to confine it to inland traffic, parties interested u in rival ports contrived to insert a clause limiting the ' charge for the haulage of all coal to Stockton for ''shipping, to one halfpenny per ton per mile, whereas u the rate of fourpence per ton per mile was allowed u for all coals transported for land sale. ' It was supposed by all parties that it would be u impossible to carry coals at such a low rate without u loss; but this rate not only turned out profitable, but u formed ultimately the vital element in the success ' OP THE railway.'* But, as these witnesses recommend heavy goods to be carried at such a low price, do they know how much it will cost to carry them ? Would it not entail a loss on the companies to do as these witnesses suggest? The Commissioners' Report shall answer the question. What does it cost to carry coal by rail ? Turn to page 76 of the Report and there get the answer in these words:— 'Receipts —320 tons at |d. per ton per mile l]]jjp. '=10s. per double mile.' r [ 'Expenses —320 tons at 23d. per double mile ' run, or 19 per cent, of the receipts (that is to say) Receipts .. .. .. .. .. 10s. Costs (including return of the trucks) ..

Id. * ' I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast 'blessed them altogether ' (Numb, xxiii. 11).36 But can passengers be carried as cheaply as goods? Answer—CHEAPER ! u Locomotive expenses ave- ' rage 7*65 (nearly 7 id.) per mile; but this average ' may be resolved into G-75 (6|d.) per train mile for passengers, and 8*5 (8|d.) 'per train mile for goods. u The repairs to engines and carriages amounts to a 3*57 ('jid.) per train mile; hence the average cost 'of a trr.in for all these charges is 11*22 (Hid.) u per mile run '' (Report fo. 75). AND ELEVENPENCE FARTHING (Hid.) IS ALL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STATED AS THE COST OF TRAIN PER MILE, IN STEAD OF 2s.; CONSEQUENTLY THE PER CENTAGE OF PROFIT IS, IN FACT, DOUBLE WHAT IS SET DOWN IN THE EXAMPLES. This surely ought to satisfy the most scep+ical of sceptics iiat IT WILL PAY to exact a small toll from every passenger on entering upon a railway, and at certain points as he passes along it j the toll to vary according to the a ass by which he selects to travel, and to provide him with a suitable carriage to travel in FREE. But the arguments and proofs that it will pay are far from exhausted. By far the strongest proofs are yet to come. Mr. B. Haughton shows to his own entire satis faction that we cannot hope for a reduction of fares on English railways; we cannot carry passengers at the low price the Belgians carry them because our premises and plant have cost so much, and wages are so high. He says, ' The extremely low fares u charged on the Belgian railways cannot be taken ^ as a guide: the Belgian lines have cost £18,000 u a mile as against £36,000 for the English lines: lk they have been charged with no Parliamentary expenses: land is of far greater value in England37 ' than in Belgium: labour is dearer in England ;* ' . . . All these things combine to make the work- ' ing of railways more costly at home, and so to &lt;£ produce higher tariffs of fares and rates. Lay all u thes^ facts and views of the question before the ' travelling public of England and they will quickly 11 wipe the film from off their eyes.' . . . All engineering matters shall be left to Mr. B. Haughton, but it is clear he may yet learn some thing of Commercial matters from a simple trades man. Jack didn't know the difference between u plaintiff and defendant' neither did the Counsel know which part of the ship was u abaft the hinnacle' The retail dealer requires 15 to 25 per cent, profit on his returns, the wholesale dealer is content with 5. The premises occupied by Messrs. Cook in St. Paul's Churchyard are worth from £10,000 to £15,000 a year rental; the first contract, for building a part of them, was £100,000; the wages of their staff of clerks, porters, warehousemen, travellers, &amp;c., amount to from £4,000 to £5,000 a week ; the returns of one department alone exccod a quarter of a million sterling a year. Calico is a staple article in their trade, and they supply a retail dealer with a single piece at such a price as would require a microscope to discover the profit on a yard of it. Yet, by the extent of their transactions, they make an enormous fortune, aided immensely by the profit upon calico. Smith, the retail linendraper, pays from £100 to £200 a year rent; the wages of his staff amount to £300 or £400 a year more ; the returns of his trade are £4,000 or £5,000 a year; he gets a penny a yard profit on all the calico he sells, yet he barely pays expenses and gets a living for his family. ' A passenger ^ is a yard of calico in Messrs. Cook's hands, a cwt. of coals in the hands of the railway director. * The lower classes have more money to spend.38 Passengers are not only a staple article but the most profitable commodity that the railway director deals in ; but with the premises and staff of Cook he is doing only the business of Smith. He gets a large profit on the little business he does but his expenses eat him up and he is on the high road to the Gazette. He carries 300 millions of passengers a year at a large profit on each one, but with the same premises and staff he could do twelve times the amount in that department, without a perceptible increase of expenses: and if he did that larger amount at a fourth of the profit on each passenger, the entire profits of that department of his business would he trebled, and he would make a fortune like Cook, instead of, like Smith, barely meeting his expenses. Will it pay? It Government were driven to take the railways in hand, not only would the profits be largely increased by doing a wholesale trade instead of a retail one with the same staff, but by an IMMENSE REDUCTION OF EXPENSES. 1st. By running carriages direct from point to point upon the trunk lines, and requiring pas sengers to change at the junctions—thereby abolish ing the system oi through carriages—' the cost of conveying passengers will be very largely reduced, and also the punctuality of the trains will be increased'' 1 (Stewart, Minutes of Evidence, q. 14,832). 2nd. A very great saving will be effected in the traffic charges by abolishing the issue of tickets to the 'people's class.'' Two hundred millions of tickets annually are issued to them noio ; and if the traffic be. only quadrupled, the issue of eight hundred million tickets would be saved by the adoption of the turnstile. (800,000,000 tickets at Is. 6d. per 1,000=:£60,000.) 'rd.

Nine-tenths of the 2,400 railway directors could be relieved of the labour of obstructing the railways, and their salaries saved; and the remain ing tenth employed to guard the public rights.* 5th. The removal of troops and police would be effected at one-sixth of the present cost. The pay ment now made is 2d. a mile for officers. Id. a mile for privates the charge in future would be about one-third of a penny a mile for officers and one- sixteenth of a penny a mile for privates. 6th. All difficulties between the postmaster-gene ral and railway companies would be obviated; the country would save annually £572,358 now paid for carrying the mail-bags and the postmen; all letters and post-office parcels would be carried on the railways free and the present rates of postage might be greatly reduced. 7th. Local rating, if not entirely abolished in con sideration of the advantage which the neighbourhood would derive from contiguity with the railways, would be adjusted upon the equitable principle pointed out in the Report,§ and all taxes upon rail ways would be abolished || (the amount now paid is £853,041).

(Compensation for personal injury now paid amounts to £34 &lt; ,379.) 9th. The purchase of the bankrupt-stock of Irish railways by the State ' at a great sacrifice,' and of the English ones at a a large reduction upon the cost price-'—the money being obtained on the credit of the British exchequer—would leave a considerable margin of profit for the State. * 10th. Legal and parliamentary expenses would be largely reduced (the present cost is £343,525), and finally a trifle might he saved out of the miscellaneous charges (£1,155,082!). WILL IT PAY TO TAKE THE TOLL AND CARRY PAS SENGERS FOR NOTHING ? Before giving the final answer, it will be well to reca 1 to mind the obserrations made when alluding U) the tardiness of railway directors to recognize their best friends and enter upon the largest and most profitable branch of their great business;—how British parliament had been to them the ablest counsellors and the gentlest friends ; urging them to deal considerately with that great host of profitable cus omers who are waiting* to pay them for their waste —to pay them for that which, daily, they throw away by wholesale ;—modestly requiring them once a ay o carry the poor man a mile for a penny, that tcy might see the advantage they obtained hy doing it j an ^ lvin f them^by Act of Parliament, twenty-one } ears to allow this seed to germinate and fructify.* et, the twenty-one years are now j^assed, and wc look back with wonder and regret to find that * Act of 1844.••'It Mil 41 one thing only in the interest of the poor man has resulted from this kind advice and gentle teachino- The directors originated the system of excursion trains. And, although attended somewhat with danger and clogged with every obstruction that can be imagined to render them distasteful, still a throng of waiting customers flocks to them in shoals for want of a simpler and better means of transport, and it ought to be profitable. The reasons why it is not so are partly told in the Report of the commissioners, as follows :— 'Excursion trains are always well filled, and on that account should be remunerative; but the evidence shows that their 'profitable character is to some extent questionable. There is a ' great deal of empty running to collect the carriages and take 'them to the places whence the trains are to start, to take them 'back, and sometimes bring them again to take back the excur- 'sion passengers. Moreover, it is alleged that they seriously 'interfere with the ordinary profits of the line.— Report, fo. 76. But, besides all this kind and gentle treatment by Parliament, and the practical example it had forced upon railway directors by enacting the par liamentary trains, what has been going on around them to prove to them the want of wisdom in the course they are pursuing ? While no country in the world contains the proportion of material for making profit out of railways that England does, every neighbouring country, by adopting the course pointed out to and rejected by the English railway director, is profiting immensely by pursuing it. And while the interest produced in this country upon the capital expended averages less than per cent.,*the Belgian, Prussian, Central German, Italian, and other Continental kingdoms are netting 6, 7 and more per cent, directly; and indirectly are largely gaining by the additional facilities given to their * Capital paid up £502,292-887 Net Eeceipts 19,631, 047 Per cent, to paid-up Capital=3 01.42 commerce and manufactures to the prejudice and cost of ours. And in what way are they doing this? For the most part their merchandise is carried at much cheaper rates than ours ; and, as regards the transport of passengers, the course adopted by them is its exact antithesis:—whilst we de vote all our thoughts to the luxurious accommoda tion of the rich, they give every consideration to promote the convenience and prosperity of the poor;* and the result is, as it deserves to be, our partial failure and their great success. Take Belgium, for example. Prior to the 1st of May, 1860, the fares were— '■1st Class .. 1-24, or l|d. a mile. '2ncl Class .. 0-93, or less than Id. a mile. u 3rd Class ,. 0 , 62, or § of Id. a mile.' —Ireland y Second Report, p. 13. These lares will be looked upon as very loiv in England, especially if almost every train be made to carry third-class passengers as is done in Belgium. But the result of reductions previously made in the carriage of goods had proved so advantageous, that on the 1st May, 1866, the Belgian government made graduated reductions in passenger fares also ;—vary ing : rom 6 per cent, on 25 miles, to 62 per cent, on 155 . iles,—the longest length of railway which the country admits ot,—thus reducing the fares for the longest distance to— '1st Class . . 0-46, or less tlian a halfpenny a mile. ' 2nd Class .. 0 , 32, or less than 5 of a penny a mile. Class .. 0-23, or less than a farthing a mile.' —Ireland, Second Report, p. 13. 1 he entire reduction on the fares for 155 miles '' is—first class from 16s. to 6s.; second class from ' 12s. to 4s. 2d.; and third class from 8s. to 3s.' '' ^ ou see the German women coming in ■with their large baskets of vegetables or fruit a distance of 10 or 15 miles into '' a market town, at a cost of three-eighths of a penny per mile, 'and they make their marketing before twelve o'clock in the ' day, and go away in crowds.'— Minutes of Evidence, 1,225.u 43 But this is not all. u The minister at the same time introduced two ' other changes in the fares and traffic arrangements —1st, by allowing third-class passengers to travel u hy express trains; 2nd, by fixing the express fares u for each class at 20 per cent, instead of 25 per cent. ' above the ordinary fares, and so giving a greater 'proportionate reduction on express than on ordi- ' nary fares. And the result of the reduction of passenger fares adopted 1st May, 1866, has been most cheering and satisfactory. 11 In 1867, the first year after the change, 350,036 ' third-class passengers availed themselves of the pri- M vilege of travelling by express trains.

After the evidence now given, and the experience afforded us by our neighbours, before finally put ting the question, WILL IT PAY TO CARRY A MAN FOR NOTHING, REQUIRING HIM ONLY TO PAY THE TOLLS? observe, once more, the gentle pressure which 1 ai Hament, through the Royal commissioners on railways, puts upon the English railway director in the io]lowing paragraphs of their report (page 61):— THE WORKING CLASSES DO NOT OB TAIN THAT BENEFIT FROM RAILWAY COMMUNICATION BY THE ORDINARY TRAINS OF THE COMPANIES WHICH A RAILWAY IS SO WELL CALCULATED TO ' AFFORD. ' In the last session of Parliament' (the Report '' is dated 7tli May, 1867),' the late President of the Board of Trade introduced a Bill which ' provided, amongst other things, for compel- ling all metropolitan railway companies to run ' trains before seven o'clock in the morning and ' after six o'clock in the evening to and from ' stations to be prescribed by the Board of Trade, 'AT PRICES NOT EXCEEDING ONE PENNY 44 FOR EACH JOURNEY. ' consequence of the pressure of public busi- u nes s the Bill was not passed,' but—'We recommend that railway companies ' should be required to afford greater facilities ' for carrying the ordinary third-class traffic, 'by running at least two trains, with third -class carriages attached, each way daily; and 'that in such mixed trains whenever return 'tickets are issued for first and second-class 'passengers, they should in like manner be 'issued for third-class passengers. ' We consider that workmen's trains, on the 'principle of those proposed in the Railway ' Clauses Bill of the Session of 1866, should be 'run in and out of every large manufacturing ' town.'—Report, fo. 61. With facilities for travelling at a nominal cost few persons will doubt the locomotive propensities of the Englishman, the Irishman, or tlie Scot; it is not necessary, therefore, to take much pains to prove the fact. But it may be worth while to ob serve that by the plan now proposed every passenger of the ' people's class' who travels more than sixteen miles will count as TWO : each one from London to Holyhead as EIGHTEEN, and to Edinburgh as TWENTY -THREE passengers. And every pas senger, of whatever class, travelling with more than 56 lbs. weight of luggage will, in a pecuniary sense, carry a u people's class' passenger in his carpet bag.* WILL IT PAY ? The answer depends only on the question, WILL THE PEOPLE TRAVEL ON THE TERMS PROPOSED ? i: ' Charge for luggage over 56 lbs. weight Id. per ewt. (or portion of cwt.) for each, turnpike or stop-station it will pass through.APPENDIX. T he following selections from the E eport of the C ommissioners are strongly recommended for careful perusal. The full Report may be obtained for Is. 4d. (postage, 4d.), either of Messrs. Spottiswoode or of Davies and Co., Finch Lane, Cornhill. The figures refer to the folio of the Report from which the extract is taken. oa An Act of Parliament constitutes an engagement with the promoters on one side and the public on the other; that this principle rightly understood conveys to the promoters no right that their privileges shall be exclusively maintained when thay cease to he consistent with general advantage; but .... should not be taken away upon any other than clear grounds of public policy. Attempts to guide committees have invariably failed. ' Every company should be compelled to afford the public the full advantage ' of free interchange of traffic from one system of railway to another. 28. 'Whilst in France there is less than miles of railway, in England and Scotland there are 2| miles of railway, to 5,000 inhabitants. 30, Parliament has reserved to itself the right of purchasing the lines after the expiration of a definite period, if it should consider that the public interests require such purchase. Parliament has also reserved a power in certain con tingencies of reducing the maximum tolls and rates leviable by railway com panies, and has also reserved the right of passing any general railway Act it may deem necessary for regulating the railway system. 32. It was cleariy contemplated by Parliament that it might be desirable at a future time to reconsider the relations of railways to the State, inasmuch as it is stated in the Act of 1844 that it is not intended to prejudge by its provisions the policy of revision and purchase, but to leave the question open for the future consideration of the Legislature upon grounds of national policy. 33. As the period of 21 years fixed by that Act for the purchase of railways authorized in 1844 has now elapsed, the proper opportunity for a full examina tion of the question has manifestly arrived. 34. The question, however, of Government purchase deserves full inquiry in a broad point of view, and the expiration of the period fixed in the Act of 1844 affords a good opportunity for inquiring, with the help of the experience which has now been acquired, whether a change of system is desirable. There being also above 2,300 miles (including some of the most important ' lines in the country) not subject to the Act of 1844, the purchase of these lines, which would be absolutely necessary to carry out the scheme, could o* ly take place with the consent of the proprietors, and this could onlv ba obtained by the offer of liberal terms. 35. In addition to the diminution' of assumed profit arising from this cause, it must not be forgotten that as the Government would have to enter the market to borrow £400,000,000 or £500,000,000 to carry out the operation, the terms upon which this could be raised would in all probability be materially affected. The depressing effect upon public securities would be equally felt, whether the Government conducted the whole operation at once, or whether it came into the market year after year to repeat an operation of about £25,000,000 a year; and it is not easy to foresee what the price of consols would be under the proposed addition of £500,000,000 to the national debt. ^ It is therefore probable that the Government would have to exchange the income of the railway companies for an equivalent income in consols. It has not been distinctly pointed out to us in what respects it is to be expected ' that the system of management by lessees would he superior to that of thesg. 37 39. 54. 56. 58. 59. 48 existing boards, but it is obvious that there are but two possible sources of im provement, viz. (1), the reduction of working expenses, and (2) the obtaining' a greater amount of work from the engines and carriages, and so increasing the receipts in proportion to the expenses. The general result of our inquiries is, that in the great heads of expenditure an increase rather than a decrease is to be anticipated, and that the economv arising from carrying full train loads could be obtained only at the sacrifice of convenience and accommodation. And, as there is no intention of cheapening the means of conveyance by railway at the expense of the national exchequer, all general laws should be such as would not entail any loss in the administration of the railways Parliament has reserved to itself the right to pass any general law to regu late the railways owned by the several companies, therefore it would be fust as easy to legislate on this basis for the existing system ; and hence any alteration in the law, if desirable, could be obtained by the machinery of the present companies, without transferring the administration of the railways to new companies. 3 In the event of the Government at any future time purchasing the rail- ways, it has been judiciously provided in the Act of 1844 that the price shall be estimated upon the net divisible income of the line, without regard to the capital expended upon its construction. On th3 part of the public it is complained that the charges are so hi^h that the resources of the country are in consequence not developed. An opinion has also been v^ery generally expressed, with more or less confidence, that the increase of traffic which would follow a large reduction of charges would be so great as ultimately to entail no loss. There is no doubt that in certain circum stances a well-considered reduction is advantageous, and we understand that in some cases where the policy of lower fares than usual has been adopted by railway companies the results have been satisfactory, but we have no facts nelore us to j ustify an Opinion that a general reduction on a large scale would not be attended with loss. Ihe reduction of fares has mainly arisen from the issue of return tickets for extended periods of time proportionate to the distances, which are a great boon to the trading community. As regards the third class, the number of third-class tiains has not materially increased, except in the vicinity of large towns, and no return tickets are as a rule issued to this class ; but on the other hand an en- tirety new description of traffic has sprung up, viz., the excursion trains, which aitord a very great amount of accommodation to the poorer classes. « fifties of passenger traffic appear to show that the second and third classes are the sources of passenger traffic which admit of the greatest ' e\ e opment. On the London and North-Westem Railway a comparison of 14 years showed that with an increase of mileage of 166 per cent, the number km Y - P assen g er trains bad increased 152 per cent.; and that ^ mist the total increase of passenger receipts had only been 78 per cent., the ^-ckss had increased 40 per cent., for second-class 74 per n u the third -class had increased 102 per cent., that is to say, it alone had kopt pace with the increased mileage. * .rail 1 i elgli: u - G } ,rina 1 n y. and Italy, it will bo seen b/ Appendix DN, the same general result is found as m France, viz., a less number of trains for first and 4vf- 0n ' Passengers than in England, but a greater number of third-class T lnS p . ruPsi a. there is a fourth class, at very cheap fares. Til n ^ H u oS a S c _i 3 allowed free beyond such hand articles as can be P &lt;ice under the seats without inconvenience to the passengers. All else is charged at the rate of about 9d. per ton per mile. , 11 ' e ' ™ an 7 usual rule appears to be, for all classes, about 50 lbs free, and about 8d. to Is. per ton per mile extra. ° c o m plete, however, any comparison it would be necessary to compare the oi a orded on Laglish lines in the number of passengers in proportion to ' e r l U111 ' '' V carnages, as well as in the arrangements to prevent the passen- r0m subject to change of carriages at junctions, ■with the rigid \ em prevailing on French and other continental lines, by which the passen49 gers are made entirely subordinate to the convenience and economy of the railway companies. 59. ln comparing the passenger traffic in England and in France, it would appear generally that first-class passengers in England availing themselves of through fast trains for long distances are carried at higher speeds (at somewhat higher fares, regard being had to the charge for luggage made in France, and to the more limited issue of return tickets), but in France persons travelliri'- by ordinary trains or third-class trains are carried at a lower rate than in Eno-land and with more frequent trains. 60. The French, as a rule, give more frequent means of intercommunication to the third class between the stations upon their railways than we do. J, In Belgium a considerable increase of traffic has followed the reduction which has from time to time been made in the rates ; notwithstanding which the profit on the capital cost of Government lines yields 6 per cent, interest. j y An important element in accommodation to passengers is the punctualitv of the trains ; unpunctuality is a great element both of inconvenience and of danger. 61. The Commission appointed by the French Government dwelt in its report at some length upon the advantages which result from increasing the comfort and reducing the cost of travelling. They inveighed against the feeling which pre vailed in France, and which has prevailed quite as much with us, of making the lower classes uncomfortable in order to drive into a higher class those passen gers who the managers of the railways considered should have travelled in that higher class. They urged that persons generally select the class in which they travel, with the object of meeting others of their own rank in society. The inconvenience to which second and third-class passengers have been subjected has diminished the inducement to travel in persons who would naturally have travelled in those classes, whilst it is the interest of railway companies to en courage travelling, and to draw their traffic from the lower classes of the population, who are the most numerous. jj The Commission further urged the want of expansion in the passenger traffic on French railways as an illustration of the absence of encouragement to this traffic, and showed that whilst in ten years the receipts from passengers had only increased from 16,814 francs to 17,980 francs per kilometre, the receipts from goods had increased from 12,411 francs per kilometre to 30,060 francs. They considered that this was partly attributable to the fact that the average fare per passenger had remained stationary at about 0-9d. per mile, whilst the price for goods and minerals per ton per mile had been decreased from r2d. to 0'9d., and they argued that the probable cause of the want of expansion of the passenger traffic was that the fares have been kept up too high. It is, however, obvious that whilst the first-class long-distance passenger traffic is probably better provided for in this country than anywhere else in the world, the working classes do not obtain that benefit from railway communica tion by the ordinary trains of the companies which a railway is so well cal culated to afford. }) The price to be paid for military and police is fixed by the Act for the Regulation of Railways at 2d. per mile for officers and Id. for privates; the authorities of the War Office have complained that where railway companies are actually charging lower fares for first and third-class passengers they exact the statutory amount from the military. 'We are of opinion that in no case should a railway company be entitled to charge more for the military and police than it charges for ordinary first and third-class passengers. On the continental railways, as we have observed, the Government has con- • ceded the lines to the companies on the condition that the mails are to be carried free. g0 Until the opening of the Great Northern railway the conveyance of coal to London by railway had no material importance. At the present time it amounts to nearly 3,000,000 tons a year. }J In 1842 the receipts from passengers formed 74 per cent., and the receipts from goods 26 per cent., of the total receipts on railways; in 1862 the receipt, from passengers formed 46 per cent., and the receipts from goods 54 per cent., of the total receipt? - , E50 66 69. 74, 75. It is thus clear that a greater development has taken place in goods traffic than in passenger traffic. The development of traffic has no doubt teen ereatlv facilitated during the last twenty years by the union of small companies into larger systems by amalgamation, by which unity of management on trunk lines has been obtained. Thus formerly the lines from London to Liverpool belonged to three different companies. The carriages and waggons of one companv we™ not allowed to pass on to the lines of the other companies, and, as we have aireadv mentioned, the Board of Trade Report for 1843 shows the great delays expense and inconvenience experienced by the public and the railway companies from that arrangement. r It is shown that the profit obtained from a waggon fully loaded is verv considerable. 1 The mere locomotive and traffic charges amount at the present time to 64-95 per cent, of the whole, and the maintenance of way to 18-31 ner cent additional making a total of 83 26 per cent., and these heads of expenditure must aiwavs form the main items of charge under any system of working. At the present time on the Great Western Railway the cost is as follows Fuel j 5 - Wages of Enginemen and Firemen Wages of Cleaners and Cokemen, &amp;c ' *43 Oil, tallow, and sundry stores» ' ] Wages and materials for repair and renewal of engines' and tenders 3-24 A\ ater, including pumping engines .jg Salaries of Superintendents .!!!!!! &gt;16 Gas, rates, buildings, and fire charges ........

The whole cost of working a train on the Great Western Eailway for 1865 amounts to 2s. T'Sld. per train mile; on the Great Northern Eailway to 2s. 6-68od.; on the South Eastern Eailway the expense is 2s. 10-72d.; and on the Northern of France 2s. 7*34d. The examination which we have given to this question leads us to the con- elusion that it is not probable that any diminution of the cost of the principal items of charge can be anticipated, but that the only saving which could pos sibly arise would be in details of expenditure. 81. That the existing mode of ascertaining the assessable value leads practically to the assessment of profits of trade, and stock in trade, and is vexatious, diffi- cult, and uncertain in operation, and creates inequalities which do not usually attach to the assessment of any other kind of property. The general principle upon which railways should berated is a clear one, viz., to take the net annual value of the land as improved in the hands of the railway company by the_ construction of the line, stations, and other works, without reference to their profits as carriers ; that is, to take the rent which would be paid by a tenant to whom the line might be leased. 82. The Poor Law Board should make an assessment for rating the whole railway, and then divide the amount according to an equitable principle between the several unions or parishes. Report of the Right Son. W. Momell, M.P. 93. seem to agree that the fundamental evil of the Irish system is want of unity of management. All complain of a disinclination to amalgamate on the part of the directors and of the rivalries and jealousies that exist between the various companies. Mr. Meldon, a large landowner in Galway and solicitor to two companies, thus described the management of the Irish railways. ' There ' are,' he said, '56 lines of railways authorized by Act of Parliament, most of 'them working. Their average length is about 48 miles long. Although the ' Great Southern and Western is 387 miles long and the Midland Great Western ' 242 miles long, yet very many of them do not extend 10 miles. Most of these ' 56 lines have a separate hoard of directors, separate engineers, solicitors, and 'secretaries, thus there are 430 directors, 56 solicitors, 56 secretaries, and up- ' wards of 70 engineers, who absorb a large portion of the receipts of the lines. ' It strikes me most forcibly that a board sitting in Dublin, consisting of three 'intelligent business -like men, would be able to do the entire business which ' the 430 directors do, and do it very much better. A vast saving of expense ' would be the result, and harmonic action would ensure a thorough connexion, ' when established, which is much required, and the traffic would bo fairly 'developed.' Captain Huish, who was for eighteen years manager of the London and North Western Eailway, attributes to this divided management four facts which he says must strike every one that travels on Irish railways—that the rates are very high, the speed very low, the trains very few, and the re muneration of the proprietors very small. 94 &lt; Mr. Forbes, who was for ten years traffic manager of the Midland Great Western, thought that about £120,000 per annum might be saved by consoli dated management. ,, Mr. Tinsly, Mayor of Limerick, stated that in the journey from that city to Dublin there was sometimes a delay of two hours at the junction with the Great Southern and Western Eailway, and although the distance between the two cities is only 130 miles the fastest train took five and a half hours, jj 'I am decidedly of opinion,' says Mr. Cawkwell, 'that the railway traffic ' of Ireland has never yet been half developed.' j j Mr. Delahunty, the managing director of the Waterford and Kilkenny and the Kilkenny Junction Eaihvays, said, 'Although the distance from Waterford 'to Dublin is only 112 miles, third-class passengers require two days for the 'journey.' ,, Mr. Allport, the manager of the Midland Eailway Company, thought 'that ' great inconvenience arose from the fact of the country being split up into such ' small divisions, and that amalgamation would be exceedingly advantageous ' to the Irish system.'94. 95. 96. 97. 52 Mr. Macfarlane, a magistrate of the County Dublin, said the arrangements of the companies in the north of Ireland were very bad. He said, ' He reached ' Omagh (about 130 miles from Dublin) about half-past three in the day, and ' unless he should stop a night on the way to Dublin he would not reach there ' before half -past five on the following evening.' This witness further stated that there are actually carriages taking the mails at night, but they carry no passengers; 'that it being important for him to go to Dublin one night, he 'got on the engine as there was no other mode.' 'There is much less ' accommodation,' said Mr. Macfarlane, ' between the north of Ireland now ' than formerly, when there were coaches both in the daytime and in the ni ^ht • 'now they have only conveyances in the day. The earliest train frointlie ' country does not reach Dublin till about half-past five p.m.' It appears from the evidence of Mr. Mulvaney, a gentleman who was for merly Commissioner of Public 'Works in Ireland, and who for many years has been extensively engaged in business in Prussia, that the fares in that country fiio ery moderate. ' In Germany, he said, ' you see the labourers travellin 0, b y railway, the women coming in with their large baskets of vegetables and ' fruit a distance of ten or fifteen miles into a market town at the cost of three- ' eighths of a penny per mile; and they make their marketing before twelve 'o'clock in the day and go away in crowds.' Mr. Forbes said: ' In ray opinion the fares and rates in Ireland are prohibitory of any development of the traffic, and have been so ever since I have known • the country. Practically since the opening of the railway system in Ireland 'nothing has been done in the way of experiment. If the rates were lowered ' there would be a very large increase in the traffic of the country.' Mr. Forbes recommended that a reduction of 50 per cent, should be made in the charges, and stated that although there would be a loss of dividend for two or three years, it \^ould be ultimately made up, but his directors would not consent, Mr. Kyan, merchant,^ of Limerick, said that on account of their high charges the railways, in Limerick were not doing the work of the country; ' carriers 4 , ' numerous on all the roads where railways are, and we see all the &lt;'&lt; oi 0 V r 0WI1 count y going by road by a route running parallel with ^ raihv ays ; that the cattle are driven long distances, having been bought in the u i es ' : 0 ' Limerick and Clare, and going up through Dublin on to Meath, where (i , ' l0 &gt; aie fattened ; this brings them into very bad condition, and there are no (&lt; m y ers who would not be willing to give a moderate price for their carriage. (£ our . passenger trains, most of them are very empty indeed, and if fares ^ were considerably reduced there would be a very large increase of third-class ^passengers; the small farmers and men going to market with their butter, corn, and other farm produce would use the railways instead of driving their ' cars along the road.' Mr. I arker, a Dublin merchant, said that owing to the unsatisfactory situa- tion of the companies, the directors were unable to venture on any bold experi- ments, and that a great reduction of fares would bring the masses to travel, a tulmg reduction in the railway fares would do nothing, a large reduction would be a political advantage, a social advantage, and a commercial advantage. There- uction of 'ares for passengers would, he thought, increase to an enormous extent the traffic. Mr. Bewley dwelt strongly on the importance in a political, social, and c mimercial point of view of a general reduction being made in the fares charged or passengers. He believed 'that if a very large reduction took place, within n .o\\ } ears the increase of the traffic would be so great as to bring up the in come to an amount greater than the present. He proposed the third class pasv ngers should be charged one-fifth of a penny per mile, second-class four- tenths, and first-class seven-tenths per mile. Mi. Bagot, a Dublin merchant, said, ' Our travellers would visit three, four, -o-e^mes morc towns in Ireland than they do if the railway charges were Mr. 1 im, the present Member for Dublin, recommended that the fares should &gt;0 i duced to jd., £d., and fd., per mile for the several classes. At present the a ouung classes do not travel by railway, as it is cheaper for them to walk.Mr. Bidder, civil engineer, thought it most desirable that a low scale should be established for the carriage of coal ; and he thought that if the lines were purchased and leased out by Government, that |i. should be paid per ton per mile. Mr. Forbes thought that coal could be carried'at M. per ton per mile all over Ireland. Mr. Brady, secretary to the Special Commissioners on Irish Fisheries, said, ' That the railways had not given those facilities of transit that would induce ' the fishermen to follow their occupation with diligence. The rates of carriage ' ou fish, particularly on small parcels, tend very much to depress it. Fisher- ' men, unless they get the way of sending small parcels of fish, each man sending ' his parcel to his factor in Dublin, must sell it to some hawker or others, who ' send it away, and the consequence is, that the hawker is the man who ' gets the profit, and the fisherman gets very little for his trouble. I think that ' if the railways afforded greater facilities you would give greater encourage- ' mentto the coast population to fish, for they will take any ordinary employ- ' ment rather than follow that very precarious one of fishing, unless they have ' good markets and facilities. Each fisherman ought to have facilities afforded ' him, then he would get his money direct the next day to himse'.f.' The chairman of the Great Southern and 'Western Kailway, Mr. Haughton, said that ' he would be a very bold man who would make the experiment of ' reducing fares, and that such a proposition had not even been taken into ' serious consideration by his board at any time, that the only change of fares ' since the opening of his railway was an advance of 10 per cent, about nine ' years ago on first and second-class fares.' He thinks that Ireland is in a poor condition, and does not expect any great increase in passenger traffic. He added ' that many Irish lines are irretrievably ruined, that he does not ' see how they are even to be kept in repair, and that there is only one line ' in the South of Ireland running into his own which has not at the present ' moment the whole of its original capital gone.' He believed that the practice of issuing return tickets leads to great frauds, and he therefore objected to it. A strong opinion in favour of the purchase of the Irish railways by the Government and their amalgamation has been expressed by Mr. Malcomson, the chairman of the Limerick and Waterford Railways, he said, ' the Irish railways 'represent an expenditure of £26,395,100, which, as valued by Mr. Dargan, are 'now worth £22,000,000.' Mr. Ennis, who at the time he gave his evidence was chairman of the Mid land Great 'Western Railway Company, was of opinion that the traffic of Ireland was a limited quantity, and do as you might in the way of reduction you would not be able to arrive at anything like a compensating receipt in money. It should, however, be here observed that Mr. Ennis subsequently explained that he meant ' with reference to any large money increase, although ' the traffic might increase, and therefore in that sense it may be said to be^a ' limited quantity,' and in illustration of this position Mr. Ennis said, 'We ' carried last year 70,000 harvest labourers back and forward to England at id. ' per mile, and we thought we had gone as far in the way of reduction as it was 'possible to go.' Mr. Ennis gave proof of the necessity of lower fares by the statement which he made from his own personal knowledge of the great number that preferred walking to pay ^d. per mile. He said, ' I have often seen men walking past ' my gates in clusters of 20 or 30, and hire one of the cars of the country for ' eight or ten Irish miles. Ten men being carried on the car they used to ride ' in, they would pay 3s. or 4s. for it.' The Earl of Lucan, chairman of the Great Northern and Western Railway, had great faith in the ultimate result of a large reduction in fares. He was firmly of opinion that' on their own railway, if they could affbrd to have a smaller dividend for the next four or five years by lowering the fares considerably, not less than 50 per cent., we should pay a larger dividend than at present. Lord Clancarty is a director of the Midland Great Western, and was so con vinced that cheap fares would not diminish railway profits that he offered to guarantee the company he is connected with against loss if they would try54 the experiment on a portion of their line, a proposition which they refused to flCCGCiG to* 102. Mr Cawkwdl, the manager of the London and North Western line w*, decidedly of optmon that the railway traffic of Ireland has never vet been half developed. He thought there could he no doubt that great good would nwnl! from amalgamation if it could be carried out. The Irish boards do not apneu ' y0U Cann0t get them t0 d0 ^ 1 believe the ^ al - e Mr. Bidder did^ not think that much even of temporary loss would be in^iirrpr? by a large reduction of the fares and charges. ' The economy which would be &lt;( ^ troduted by sweeping away so many boards of directors, the greater economv that would take place in the working from being in one set of hands the ^ greater use that would be made of the rolling stock and the stimulus that « w0 + 5° S1Vei110 t T lf ^ by the lowerin g of th e rates would be ^tendedwith great advantages^ I think that a company taking the Irish railways in hand u 1 have suggested, and beginning at once upon those terms nvould secure the state from any possible loss.' 108, 109. 110. 111. 112. 113. 114.

The management of most of the lines (with a few creditable exceptions) seems to be universally regarded as at once costly and inefficient, the fares and other charges as unnecessarily high, whilst for want of that co-operation now becoming, through amalgamation and other means, so common in England and ocotland, the conveyance of passengers and goods is subjected to much incon venience and derangement. Many of the companies are represented to be in serious pecuniary difficulties and it is urged that without aid from Government several of the lines must fall into disuse. Ihe evidence shows the existence in Ireland of a strong desire for the pur chase of the railways by Government, and that such desire, if not universal is very general. ' It should be added, that as the whole railway system of Ireland does not greatly exceed^ the^ length of line held by some single companies in England while the capital invested and the amount of traffic are even less, the purchase of the_ lines would involve comparatively little risk or responsibility. It is therefore recommended that the Irish lines should be purchased by Government, as early as practicable, in the manner proposed in par. 10 in re spect of railways generally. A reference to Mr. Monsell's separate Eeport will show that while there are important points of difference between us, especially as to the conditions of purchase, we nevertheless agree in recommending that the Irish railways shou Id be dealt with first, and that their purchase by Government should be made with all convenient speed.

COLONEL, ROYAL ENGINEERS. LONDON: longmans, giieen, and co. 1870. JINTRODUCTION. The two first Sections of the present paper comprise the substance of two papers read to the Philosophical Society of New South Wales in 1856 and 1857. The object was to bring clearly before the com munity the nature and extent of the advantages afforded by Eailways of different kinds for the trans port of passengers and goods; and, while pressing these on the notice of the public, to clear away a misconception, which appears to prevail pretty gene rally, that there are no limits to the beneficial or profitable action of the Locomotive Engine as a mov ing power. For this purpose it was necessary to investigate carefully the comparative cost of transport upon the different kinds of Koads, and by the use of different descriptions of power. The result of this investigation, so far as regards the Colony of New South Wales, is shown in the second section, where it is proved that, under condi tions analogous to those therein specified. Horse power would be cheaper than Steam power. On my arrival at Madras, I found the Govern ment engaged in pressing forward the works upon several lines of Eailway j and although the conclu sions which I had drawn from my investigations inc) Australia led me to doubt whether the ordinary in terest upon the capital expended would be realized by the traffic upon these lines; yet, as the indirect benefit to the population at large might be great and as the political advantage accruing from the rapidity and certainty of the transport of Troops and Military Stores was indubitable, I did not think it necessary to enter upon any enquiry as to the character of the lines in progress. Of late, however, various schemes have been brought forward for the extension of the Railway system. Some of these contemplate the construction of branches, or extensions of the main lines, upon the same gauge, and with the same rolling stock; others propose to have lighter rails, with a narrower gauge, but the motive power is still to be the Locomo tive Engine ; others again, propose to lay down rails upon the existing roads, and to use animal power in stead of steam. Under these circumstances I have thought it advisable to reprint the papers read by me in New South Wales, and to add a third section, de scriptive of all those peculiarities of the Indian climate, and of the habits and customs of the people, which may have any influence upon the profitable working of the Indian Railways.i mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmBmatBHHK&amp;KKKKBHtKKttKBM SECTION I. RAILROADS. A BRIEF OUTLINE OP THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RAIL WAY SYSTEM IN ENGLAND, WITH SUGGESTIONS AS TO ITS APPLICATION TO THE COLONY OF NEW SOUTH WALES. A H istory of the last thirty years would be very incom plete which excluded from consideration the vast changes which have been wrought in the state of society by the intro duction of railroads. Socially^ politically, and morally, these changes have been very great; and it would be a curious and an interesting study to trace the efiects which have resulted from the introduction of this easy and rapid system of loco motion; some of which have originated directly from the forces put into action for the completion of the railways themselves, and for maintaining them in effective operation; but more of which must be traced to feelings and motives lying deep in man's nature, but which have been stimulated into activity by circumstances connected more or less inti mately with the physical changes of which the railway system has been productive. We areas yet in the infancy, or, at all events, in the youth of this system ; and if the past presents much of importance to the historian and moralist, the future offers as wide, or a wider, opening to the speculative philoso pher. With questions such as these, however, it would be premature to deal. If railways are in their youth elsewhere, here they are in their infancy; and it will be more immedi ately interesting and useful to investigate the steps by which other countries have arrived at a position so far in advance of ourselves, than to speculate upon the possible changes which may take place here, when we have availed ourselves of the experience of others, and, by the exercise of skill, energy. ■8 and perseverance, have brought these causes into action which have produced so marvellous an effect elsewhere, but which, for the present, are with us dormant. In the short compass of a paper like this, it would be impossible to give anything like a history of the various steps by which the common cast-iron tram of the coal districts, on which horse traction only was used, has developed itself into the wrought iron railway, traversed by steam engines of great weight and power. A sketch is all that can be attempted, and is, indeed, all that is required; for our object in this Colony should be rather to avail ourselves of the principles which have been established during the course of a long series of experiments, than to follow blindly in a track which would lead to waste of both time and money, and very much check the development of the resources of the Colony. In tracing the extension of the railway system in Eng land, it may be as well to look back some hundred and fifty years, and to enquire what was the state of the roads about the end of the seventeenth century. From all the accounts which have been handed down to us, it would seem that roads in England at that time were very similar to those tracks which are in this Colony dignified by the name ; badly laid out with reference to the country through which they passed, and worse constructed. In the year 1700, however, the demand for increased facilities for transport forced the Legislature to consider the means by which an improvement could be made in the condition of the main lines of commu nication ; and the system of turnpike trusts commenced, which, in the course of little more than a century, covered Lngland with a network of roads, the aggregate length of which was not less than 24,000 miles. Under the turnpike system, however, the improvement in the state of the roads was very slow; the introduction of a better scheme of management produced, of course, some beneficial effects, but this could not compensate for the wantof experience in tlie construction and management of the roads, or of a knowledge of the general principles which have been the result of many experiments, some of which have proved successful, others, most unsuccessful. We must not be surprised, therefore, to learn that in the year 1800, after the labour of a century had been bestowed upon the roads, they were in an indifferent state; that the rate of travel ling upon them was slow, and the cost of transport great. In the middle of the last century, attention was drawn to the advantages afforded by water transport, and a very large capital was expended upon canals leading from the great manufacturing towns to the metropolis, and to the sea-ports. The effect of the cheapness of this means of communication was very visible in the increase and development of manu facturing industry, and in the enhanced value of land in the vicinity of these great channels of trade. The necessity of adopting some means by which the traction on ordinary roads could be lessened, was first felt in the Northern Colliery District; and wooden tramroads were first laid in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, at the end of the seventeenth century. These, after a time, were exchanged for cast-iron, which was found, from its durability, to be cheaper than wood. Wrought iron rails were subsequently adopted, when the demand for increased supplies of coal made it ne cessary to substitute steam for horse power. In 1826, the commencement of the railway era, the con dition of England, so far as regards the means of internal communication, may be summed up as follows. The country was traversed by about 25,000 miles of turnpike roads, upon which coaches travelled at a speed of from eight to twelve miles per hour, and on which goods were conveyed by wag gons, at an average cost of about 9^cZ. per ton per mile. In addition to these, there was a network of canals, the aggre gate length of which exceeded 3000 miles, upon which goods were conveyed at the cost of about Id. per ton per mile.10 lh( to were, m tlie coal, and some of the other miiierai dis tricts, several hundred miles of iron tramways and railways for the conveyance of minerals to the port of shipment, or to the principal markets. At that time, however, the demand for increased facilities for communication between Manchester, the centre of the cotton manufacture, and Liverpool, the port of entry of the raw material, was so urgent as to induce the formation of a Company for the purpose of constructing a railway between the two towns, upon which passengers and goods should be conveyed in carriages propelled by steam power; and after some delay, on account of the new and expensive character of the work, the Liverpool and Manchester railway was opened in 1830. The length of this line is 32 miles, the original cost about £840,000, or on an average, £26,250 per mile. The returns during the year 1831 were sufficient to give a dividend of about 10 per cent, upon the above capital, a return which is sufficient of itself to show the enormous development of the traffic between the two towns ; but which, when analysed, exhibits the peculiar feature of a much greater extension of the passenger than of the goods traffic. This successful experiment on the part of the Manchester ana Liverpool Company had the effect of stimulating others to follow their example ; numerous Companies were formed, which, availing themselves of the experience which had been gained during the progress of the works at Liverpool, and of the daily improvements made in the machinery of the loco motives, and in all the other details of railway engineering, commenced the construction of lines from the metropolis towards every part of the country, and in 1855 the length com pleted amounted to 8240 miles, at a cost of 291 millions. All this has been executed in about twenty-five years, so that about 300 miles of railway have been constructed annually, at a cost of about nine millions, or at the rate of about £30,000 per mile.11 It would be useless to go at any length into the details of the modifications and improvements which have been made in the construction of the locomotive engine^ and in the arrangements for accommodating the different descriptions of traffic. It will be easily understood that the stimulus given to the mechanics of the whole world by the intro duction of locomotive power upon railways was not with out its fruits. Alterations and improvements have been made, and are daily making, not only in the construction of the engines, but in all the minor details of the railway. Most of these have for their object the development and extension of the peculiar advantages of steam traction; namely, the increase of speed, and of power, for the purpose of meeting the enormously increased amount of traffic. A few examples will suffice to convey an idea of the nature of these alterations. The locomotive which gained the prize of £500, offered by the Directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, weighed 4 tons 5 cwt., and the tender with water and coke, weighed 3 tons 4 cwt. The conditions of the experiment were, that the engine should not weigh more than 6 tons; that if it weighed more than 4| tons, it should rest upon six wheels; that it should draw three times its own weight at a rate of ten miles per hour, and should not cost more than £550. In the experiment the Rocket, built by Mr. Robert Stephenson, drew a gross load of 17 tons, including its own weight, at the average rate of 14 miles per hour. When, however, engine power was practically applied to railway purposes, it was soon found that the wheels of the engine were apt to slip on the rail in wet weather with even an ordinary load, and in all weathers, when the load was increased beyond a certain proportion to the weight of the engine. To remedy this the engines were made heavier, so as to augment the friction upon the rail, and this addition to the weight was accompanied by a corresponding increase of power and speed.] 2 These additions to weight and velocity involved alterations m the constrnction of the railway. The light rails nsed upon the Liverpool and Manchester line, which weighed 351bs. per yard, were not, of course, strong enough to support the in. creased load brought upon them; and rails weighing45, 60 75, and 90 lbs. per yard have gradually been introduced' The increased power of the engine, and the hold on the rail obtained by throwing additional weight on the driving wheels, enable the train to ascend gradients, which before were worked by stationary or auxiliary engines ; but, on the other and, the increased velocity has made it advisable to pav greater attention to the plan of the road, the curves of which aro now described with a larger radius than heretofore, for, when great speed is required, some sacrifices must be made m order to secure a line as straight as possible. This is a brief sketch of what has taken place in England. dlffer ™t stages in the scale of progression may be summed up as follows :—- Ist.—Muddy tracks. 2nd.—Turnpike roads. 3rd.—Tramroads of wood. 4tli. Do. 0 f i r o nt 5th.—Railroads with light rails, worked by locomotive engines at low speed. 6th.—Railroads with heavy rails, traversed by engines o great weight and power, drawing loads of 150 tons, at a rate of from 25 to 50 miles per hour. . , not, howt v't'i, be assumed that these changes were eit er general or simultaneons; that the muddy lane ceased o exist when the turnpike road was put in operation; or that these latter have been altogether banished by the railroad; on the contrary, every change had to undergo the most deter- mined opposition. At the first introduction of railways, the owners of property, who are now eagerly striving to get the13 lines as near them as possible^ exerted all tlieir influence to keep them at a distance. It is only within the last fifteen years that more enlightened ideas have prevailed^ and that people have been made aware that every additional facility given to locomotion confers a most important benefit npon the country. It is true that in many instances the works of the railways have been executed at a cost which the returns have not justified, and the capital expended has yielded but a scanty return of interest; but this has been principally due to an unwholesome system of competition, which has induced an outlay upon works where the amount of traffic, though sufficient to pay the expense of working the line, and main taining the road, is not adequate to the payment of interest upon the capital laid out. The experiments which have been carried on for the last thirty vears in various parts of the world, have been uniform in certain results, which may, therefore, be safely laid down as general principles for our guidance in discussing the policy Oi adopting railroads as our principal means of internal commu nication. It has been shown that increased facilities of com munication have an immediate tendency to augment traffic; the augmentation, however, takes place to a much greater extent in passengers than in goods. Increased facility of com munication is also in all cases productive of economy; this, however, is shown more in the transit of goods than of passen gers. In the case of the latter, though there is often an actual reduction in the cost of conveyance, yet the principal saving is in time. With regard to goods, the actual reduction in the cost of transport is enormous, while the benefit is still further enhanced by the certainty and rapidity with which they are conveyed. A reference to the traffic returns of English railways will establish these facts beyond a doubt; and there is no question that were we in possession of similar returns from other countries the result would be the same. Ihis brief sketch of the introduction of the railway system in14 England, and of its extraordinary and rapid development will not, 1 trust, be uninteresting; and it will be most useful if it should have the effect of introducing a more close inves tigation of all the causes which have had an influence in producing such a state of things, with a view to the appli- cation of the results of such an investigation to the circum- stances of the Colony. In carrying out an investigation of this kind, however, care must be taken to keep constantly in view the very marked differences between the state of things in the Colony and the mother country. In England the population is densely packed together, and the manufacturing and agricultural interests are enor mously developed. In this Colony, on the contrary, the popu- 1 at ion is thinly scattered, and the agricultural and manufac turing interests are yet in their infancy. Ihere is thus, instead of an analogy between the state of things in the two countries, a marked and striking difference. We cannot, therefore, assume without proof, that because it has been found advisable in England to expend some three hundred millions in improving means of communication already comparatively excellent, it will be to our benefit to expend m New South Wales a tithe of that sum for the same purpose; but that such an expenditure will be most benefi cial 1 firmly believe. The very marked differences which exist between the mother country and this Colony appear to me to strengthen rather than to weaken the groundwork upon which this belief is based; and I trust, before I conclude, to be able to make you partakers of my convictions. In order to this, it will be necessary, in the first place, that a clear and definite idea should be formed of the nature of the benefit which the country is supposed to derive from improved means of communication, more especially from railroads; nd it would be desirable, if possible, to make some approxi mation to the amount of this benefit, as measured according15 to some pecuniary standard. Now^ the benefit which the yro- prietor of a railway derives from it is measured by the clear annual return of profit resulting from the payment made for the conveyance of passengers and goods^ after all the cost of transport^ and that of the maintenance and repairs of the road have been defrayed ; but while this is a correct representation of the benefit which an individual or a private Company can derive from the ownership of a railway, the case becomes very different when the Government, acting for the commu nity at large, undertakes the construction of such works. In this case, the direct benefits, which are measured by the profits of the railway as a speculative investment of capi tal, and the indirect benefits, which are those resulting to society at large from the use of the railway, are merged together, the community being both proprietor and employer of the railway; and the amount of these latter, taking their monetary value only into consideration, is very far in excess of the former, as I shall be able to prove. Take, for instance, the English railroads. The direct return to the shareholders is estimated to be on an average from 50 to 55 per cent, of the gross receipts; that is, the cost of transport and management, together with that of keeping the road in repair, absorbs about from 45 to 50 per cent, of these receipts, leaving the above balance as profit. It is now found, however, that while the traffic is contin ually increasing, as is shown by the annual returns, the shareholders are receiving but a very small interest on their capital: that is, the direct benefit, as before defined, is small. With regard to the indirect benefit, we have, luckily, the means of arriving at the amount of the saving in the cost of conveyance of goods, in the fact, that the average cost of cartage upon a good turnpike road was 9^d. per ton per mile, while on the railway it varies from 2d. to 3d.; that is, there is a saving of upwards of 70 per cent, in the cost of transport of goods ; while in the conveyance of passengers, if the actualig money saving bo not so great, the saving of time is fully 70 per cent. Now, the actual returns on the English railways, in 1856, amounted to upwards of twenty-one millions; and the saving, on the above assumption, would amount to forty, nine millions; while the direct return of interest did not exceed eleven millions. It may be said, however, that these returns can only be expected in a country thickly peopled, with an enormous trade already developed; and that, in this Colony, we must pass through all the various modes of road- making before we can hope to arrive at similar results. This, however, I conceive to be a mistake. The advantage to a community of any improvement in the means of communica tion must be measured, partly by the difference between the cost ot transport upon the old roads and upon the new, and, partly, by the increase given to the value of property. Now, from the returns furnished by the different benches of Magis trates in various parts of the Colony, the present cost of transport throughout the Colony is shown to vary from about one shilling to eleven shillings per ton per mile. The average, however, may be taken at from two to three sh illi ngs per ton per mile. W ere the cost of conveyance per ton per mile upon a railroad the same as in England, the saving would be at least 90 per cent. It will be safer, however, to take the actual charge upon the Paramatta railroad, which is six pence per ton per mile, as a measure of the probable future charge throughout the Colony, and in this case the saving will be / d per cent. As an instance of the actual amount of benefit conterred upon a particular locality, the returns from Campbell-town may be taken. Campbell-town is about b3 miles Irom Sydney, upon a road to which a good deal of attention has been paid. The return states the actual amount of traffic backwards and forwards to be about 8,700 tons per annum, and the average cost to be two shillings per ton per mile, or £28,710 per annum as the17 •whole charge for transport. Now, by railway, at sixpence per ton per mile, the whole charge would amount to £7,177; and the difference between this and the former amoilnf of £28,710, or £21,633 per annum, is but a portion of the in direct benefit conferred upon this district by the substitution of a railway for a turnpike road. I say, but a portion ; for, in the first place, I have made no allowance for the saving of money and time to the passengers on the road; I have not calculated on the increased amount of traffic, which will most assuredly be the result of the introduction of railway commu nication ; neither have I taken the increased value given to property into consideration; I have merely taken the present amount of goods traffic; and have shown that the saving in the cost of transporting it for a distance of 33 miles amounts to upwards of £21,000 per annum; a sum which, at 6 per cent., represents a capital of £350,000. As, then, the present cost of transport in this Colony far exceeds that by turnpike roads in England, the saving to the inhabitants by the intro duction of railways will be larger in proportion than in Eng land. I am not in possession of any data which could enable me to form an opinion as to the number of passengers, or the probable charge for their conveyance; but it is evident that the same reasoning will apply to these as to passengers in England, and that the saving of time, owing to the rapidity and certainty of conveyance by railway, will be relatively as great. The next question for consideration in forming an esti mate of the indirect benefit resulting from railway commu nication is the increase in the value of property. In many parts of the Colony the land, of which the Go vernment is in the possession of thirty-nine-fortieths, is un saleable. The distance from a market, and the enormous cost of transport, would render land at a distance of 100 miles from Sydney almost valueless, even were it of the richest description. Take, for instance, a farm of 100 acres, at 100 b18 miles from a market, and assume the produce available for sale to be 800 bushels of grain of some sort. This, which would weigh about 20 tons, would, at the rate of 25. per ton per mile, cost, for transport only, £200, or 5s. per bushel; and the farmer would, of course, be utterly unable to compete with the foreign producer. Even the farmer in Michigan, who has to bring his grain, or the flour produced from it, a distance of nearly 2000 miles to New York, and from thence 12,000 or 14,000 miles by sea to New South Wales, would be able to undersell a farmer living not more than 100 miles from Sydney, whose only communication is by the ordinary roads of the Colony. Place, however, the farmer within a few miles of a railway, and everything is reversed; his pro duce is conveyed to Sydney for £50 instead of £200, or for Is. 3d. per bushel instead of 5s. He is, therefore, in a posi tion to undersell the foreign producer; and, a market being insured for the produce of his farm, the land in the neigh bourhood assumes a value proportionate to its quality; and a rise in the price of land of from 300 to 400 per cent, may fairly be expected. With regard, however, to these calculations as to the amount of indirect benefit, it will be seen that they are based upon the assumption that the cost of transport upon the rail road will be 6d. per ton per mile. It is true that this is the charge at present on the Paramatta Railway, but it is to be observed, that out of this sum of 6d. the Government receives upwards of 2£d. as interest of capital. If, then, the charge for transport were reduced by this amount, the benefit to the community would be enhanced to an equal, if not to a greater extent, by the stimulus given to production, and the increase in the value of property. The inference which I am disposed to draw from what I have here stated is, that in undertaking the construction of railways by the Government upon a large scale, it would, perhaps, be wise to relinquish altogether the idea of obtaining19 any direct benefit from them in the shape of interest of capital, and to be content with the indirect returns accruing from the saving in the cost of transport, and the increase in the value of property. With regard to the former, it would give evidence of its existence in the general development of business of every kind; but the latter would assume a tan gible shape, and would pour more money into the Treasury than would compensate for the capital sunk in constructing the railway. If, for instance, the Government, being the owner of 200 millions of acres of land, were to sink the value of one-fourth of this in the construction of railways, by which the value of the remaining three-fourths would be doubled, the actual money profit to the Colony by the transaction would be equivalent to the present value of 150 millions of acres of land, irrespective of all other advantages. In advocating a large outlay upon the railways as the only mode by which this Colony can ever be made capable of supporting a dense population, and, therefore, as the only means by which it can be made prosperous and powerful, I must not be understood as pledging myself to the adoption of any particular scheme. It is a matter of comparative un importance whether we adopt the wide or the narrow gauge. I do not think it is necessary, under our present circumstances, to insist upon uniformity of gauge as a matter of necessity, although it would-, I admit, be desirable to establish some uniform system. What we do require is the railway or tramway (for in principle they are identical), that is, the hard, uniform, and comparatively level surface upon which carriages can run without much friction or resistance. The nature of the road is altogether independent of the power which is to be used to transport goods and passengers upon it. This may either be steam or animal power, the character being determined by the nature and amount of the traffic on the road, or by peculiar considerations which may make it more economical to use one kind of power than another. It20 is true that in the consideration of any particular scheme, the description of power to be employed must have much influ ence upon the details : but a railway is still a railway, though the carriages are drawn by horses, and the benefit to the country through which it passes may be quite as great in such a case as if locomotive power were employed. It may be asked, what power will it be desirable to employ in this Colonv? To this the simple answer would seem to be, that which is the cheapest, provided it be sufficient. In England the amount of traffic upon the different lines, and the demand for speed on the part of the passengers, has made the univer sal adoption of steam power a matter of necessity; but before we assume this to be the case in New South Wales, a proper calculation must be made as to the relative cost and efficiency of the different kinds of motive power. I do not, of course, mean to infer that cheapness is to be the only consideration; but I do moan to say that, in the present condition of the Colony, it would be unwise to incur any great additional expense for the purpose of increasing the speed of transit beyond ten or twelve miles per hour for passengers. If, then, horse-power can be shown to be cheaper than steam, and, though slower, competent to the conveyance of the traffic which is likely to come upon the line for some years to come, I should certainly recommend that it should be em ployed. In discussing the question of the relative expense of the two systems of locomotion, the actual cost of working the line in each case is not the only matter to be considered. The cost of constructing the road in either case must enter into the comparison. For instance, for steam power the line must be straighter in plan; less steep and a brupt, and less undulating in section; the rails must be heavier, and all the work upon the road more massive and substantial; while even upon the more solid road, the wear and tear of the heavy locomotives going at speed, will be far greater than that21 caused by horse traffic. Taking all tilings into consideration, T should be disposed to believe that the line prepared for locomotive power would cost, at least, double of that laid down for horse power; and the wear and tear will probably be larger in the same proportion. This, however, as I said before, must be determined by calculation and experiments ; and I hope on some future occasion to be able to lay before you the results of some which are now in progress. I have in the present paper confined myself as much as possible to the general question, on the satisfactory elucida tion of which the adoption of railroads as the ordinary means of communication must depend. Hereafter, I trust full ac counts will be laid before the Society of the practical work ing of the different systems which may be tried, and the members will then be in a position to render valuable ser vice to the Government, by classifying and analysing these returns, from which only we can hope to deduce results ap plicable to the peculiar circumstances of the Colony.22 SECTION 11. In a paper which I read to the Society last year, I gave a sketch of the development of the railway system in England, together with some general remarks upon the advantages which might be anticipated from the application of a similar, or, perhaps, I should say analogous, system to New South Wales. These advantages I was in a position to assert would be very great; but, as my object at the time was to bring the question in its broadest features under the consideration of the Society and the public, I abstained from any attempt to discuss it in detail. I expressed no opinion as to the particular character of road, or as to the power which it might be advisable to employ upon it. These, as I said at the time, were matters which ought to be determined by observation and experiment; and it is with a view to bring under the notice of the Society such facts and observations as have been elicited in various ways during the last twelve months, that I now lay before the members this, which may be looked upon as a supplement to my former paper. I may remind the members in the first place, that the subject of railways has been under the consideration of a Committee of the Legislative Assembly, and that facts and opinions have been elicited during the examination of seve ral witnesses, all of which having been printed, are now in the possession of the public. In addition to this published matter, I have been placed in possession of a mass of infor mation having reference to the employment of horse power, both on common roads, or wooden trams, and on iron rail roads ; all of which has an important bearing upon the ques tions which will have to be determined, namely, the characteririntei,^ 1 git mi ® 23 of the road which it would be advisable to construct^ and the nature of the tractive power to be employed upon such road. I have also been furnished with a report on the railroads of the United States, addressed to the Committee of the Privy Council by Captain Douglas Galton, R.E., which con tains much valuable information. Having, then, such a mass of information at my disposal, I feel that I am now in a position to discuss those questions upon which, in my former paper, I declined to express an opinion; and as the subject is daily assuming more and more importance, whether it be regarded as a mere question of economy, or as one, upon the proper solution of which the future advancement of the Colony must mainly depend, I do not think that the Society can be called upon to con sider one of greater interest. Before I proceed to inquire into the character of the roads which it would be desirable to substitute for those at present in existence, I may as well attempt to give a more detailed sketch of the latter than I attempted to do in my former pa,per. The following gene ral description, from personal observation, will apply to both the Western and Southern roads. From the terminus of the railroad at Paramatta or Liver pool, these roads pass, for a certain distance (some twenty or thirty miles) through enclosed property. They are, as a general rule, badly laid out; that is, but little attention has been paid to the form and inclination of the ground; the culverts and bridges have, in very many instances, been constructed of perishable materials, and with little reference to the quantity of water which would have to pass through them : little or no attention has been paid to drainage j the soil being generally a strong tenacious clay or loam, and the road having but in few instances been metalled, these portions of the line are in wet weather almost impassable. In dry weather the clay gets baked and hard, and the power expended in moving a load upon these roads is then I24 a minimum; but the surface is at that time covered with a soft impalpable dust, which is not only most unpleasant to travellers, but also causes a great resistance to traction. From the point where these roads enter the bush, that is, when they cease to be fenced in, they do not improve. The difficulties which are opposed to locomotion do not diminish, though they vary in character according to the nature of the country through which the roads pass. The observations which were made as to the faulty direction of the road, the absence of drainage, the bad construction of culverts, &amp;c., apply with as great force to the roads through the bush as to those through enclosed land. Where the bush is not too dense, it may occasionally be possible, where the usual track is very much cut up by traffic, to diverge, for the purpose of escaping some par ticular obstacles ; yet, when the weather is wet, the ground in the bush is as saturated with moisture as the road itself, and where the crust of vegetable mould, consolidated with roots and vegetable fibres, is once broken through, the sub soil is incapable of resisting the action of the wheels, and constant accidents take place. A\ hen the road passes through a sandy soil, the draught, which is very heavy in dry weather, is less so in wet; but the drains are speedily choked by the sand brought down by the rain. In rocky soil the inequality of surface is a constant im pediment to traction, both in wet weather and dry; in the former the hollows are filled with mud, and the road con sists of alternations of mud holes and hillocks, the effect of which is most injurious upon both cattle and carriages, and in the latter, though the holes are full of dust or sand instead ot mud, the rocky obstacles remain as prominent as ever. This description, which from personal observation I can testify applies to the Southern and Western roads, is, I believe, equally applicable to the Northern lines from Maitland, with i-.* w. ;25 the additional obstacles arising from the more numerous watercourses^ on that line, which, not being bridged, become impassable in wet weather, and which, besides the delay and hindrance to communication they occasion, entail annually the loss of several lives. The correctness of this account of the state of the main lines of communication throughout the Colony will, I think, be vouched for by many of the mem bers now present; and it will not, therefore, be a matter of surprise that the cost of conveyance upon these roads should vary from a minimum of Is. to a maximum of 2s. 4^. per ton per mile; or that the average rate upon the Northern roads should be Is. 10|(i. per ton per mile, on the Western roads Is. H^cZ. per ton per mile, and on the Southern Is. l\\d. per ton per mile. The loss and inconvenience which such a state of things occasions cannot of course be measured by the difference of cost between the transport on these roads, and that upon either a good turnpike-road or a railroad; allowance must be made for the delays which constantly take place. It is not an uncommon occurrence for a dray to be upwards of a month in going from Sydney to Groulburn, a distance of 125 miles; or six weeks between Sydney and Braidwood, a dis tance of 185 miles. The farmer is often prevented from sending down his wheat at the time when the market would suit him, the roads being too bad to permit him to venture his teams upon them ; or the price of transport so high as to swallow up all the profit on his crop. As, however, the difference of cost of conveyance upon these roads and upon a good turnpike or railroad is the-mea sure of the minimum amount of injury done to the Colony, it may be as well that I should give an approximate estimate of its money value. Along the Northern road 25,800 tons of goods are moved for various distances, which, when reduced, give 1,183,770 tons moved one mile for £110,653, or, at the average rate26 of Is. 10K per mile. Now the cost of moving goods upon a good turnpike road should not exceed 9 J A per ton per mile, which would be a saving of U OJrf. per ton per mile or in round numbers of £62,887 ; while, on a railroad, this quantity of goods might be moved for U. per ton per mile, or less, and the saving in this case would be £81,059. Along^ the Western road the traffic is equivalent to 1,615,725 tons moved one mile for a sum 0^156,737^ at a rate of Is. UK The saving then, in this case, at the rates stated above, would be £92,800 in the case of a tarn- piko road, and €110,344 in the case of a railroad. On the .Southern road the traffic is equivalent to 1 916 022 tons moved one mile for £188,672, or at the rate of Is. 11^, per ton per mile. The saving in this case would amount to £11..,830 m the case of a turnpike road, and to £139,709 in the case of a railroad. Along these three lines, which may be termed the main artenes of communication, the loss to the inhabitants of the different districts, occasioned by the badness of the roads, amounts, on the transport of goods alone, to £268,517 per annum : and, were a railroad the means of communication, e saving, by the use of it, would amount to £338,175 per annum 1 his, I have said, is the minimum amount. I have allowed nothing for the increased expense to passengers, I have said nothing of the diminished value of land, I have merely taken the returns of existing traffic, and have shown that the saving m the expense of conveying it would justify an outlay of Capital on these three lines, the length of which amounts altogether to 843 miles, of £5,370,340. in making turnpike roads, or of £6,763,600, in the construction of rail- ways; t iat is, of £6,370 per mile upon the one, or £8,000 per mile upon the other, I have assumed 9^. per ton per mile as the fair charge upon a good turnpike road ; this was the average charge in England previous to the constmc- n of railways, and it covered, not only the cost of trans-27 port, but also the tolls, which produced a sum adequate to maintain the road in repair, and, in many instances, to the payment of some interest upon the capital expended upon the formation of the road. In this Colony, however, the sum taken as the average cost of transport is chargeable with but a very small amount of the repair of the road, the tolls received upon the different roads do not amount on an average to more than £5,600 or to £13 per mile on the whole length of the road charged with toll, while the Legislature has ap propriated, during the present year, a sum of £29,000 to wards the maintenance and repair of these roads, which sum ought properly to be added to the amount of saving which would accrue were the roads placed in a proper state, and which would represent an additional capital of £580,000. The state of the roads, then, is such as not only to occa sion a heavy annual loss to the community, but to saddle it with a heavy amount of taxation in addition. By what means can so unsatisfactory a state of things be remedied ? There are three modes of doing this which naturally pre sent themselves. Ist. By the construction of turnpike roads; that is, of roads properly laid out, drained, and macadamized, and maintained out of the proceeds of tolls. 2nd. By the construction of railroads on which horse power will be used. 3rd. By the construction of railroads on which the traction will be performed by steam power. The preference to be given to any one of these schemes over the others must be determined by a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages attendant upon each, and by a correct estimate of the charge which it will be necessary to impose upon goods and passengers, in order to cover the cost of traction, that of keeping the road in repair, and the interest28 of the capital expended in making the road. To an analysis of these matters I will now proceed to draw your attention. Ist. As to turnpike roads. These, when in their best condition, are tracks broad enough for different vehicles to pass each other, laid out at as gradual a slope as the nature of the country will permit, properly^ drained, and covered with a stratum of hard broken stone of sufficient thickness to resist the action of the traffic, and to protect the foundation of the road from the rain fall ing on its surface. Upon such a road, when properly con structed and kept in repair, a horse will draw from 15 to 24 cwt. net weight, and the cost of conveyance will be from 9^. to 12c?, per ton per mile, including of course in this the sum paid for tolls, out of which the cost of maintaining the road in repair must be defrayed, as well as the interest on the capital expended in its construction. The amount of the capital required will, of course, depend upon a variety of circumstances ; the character of the country, the nature of the soil, the quality of the materials, and especially the price of labour. Taking, however, all this matters into consideration, the cost of constructing properly one mile of road may be es timated roughly at £3,000 per mile. Ihe cost of a railroad which is intended to be worked by horse power, will not differ much from that of a turnpike road. The heavy expense of cuttings and embankments for the purpose of diminishing gradients, which, when locomotive power is employed, are works of absolute necessity, is, in this case, not required. I am aware that, in making this statement, I am placing my opinion in opposition to that of Engineers of some experience ; but the difference between us is more in appearance than reality, and is due to the fact that we look at the subject from different points of view ; my object being to showhow a given amount of goods and passengers can be con veyed from one point to another at the least possible cost, and theirs being to explain how the greatest result can be derivedfrom a given amount of power. It is, of course, unquestion able that the advantage gained by the substitution of the hard and smooth iron rail for the soft and rough material of the road, is a maximum when the road is absolutely level. In this case, we learn by experience that a horse can draw on a rail road, about eight times the load which he can move along a turnpike road. On an ascent the power which the horse has to exert is compounded of that which is necessary to overcome the force of gravity, and of that which balances the friction of the road, &amp;c. The force of gravity is, of course, the same on both road and railroad, and varies in proportion to the steep ness of the slope of the road ; while the friction is a constant quantity, or nearly so; that of the turnpike road being eight times as great as that of the railroad. While, therefore, the ratio between the effective power of a horse on a railroad and on a macadamized road, when both are on a level, is as eight to one, this ratio is reduced to three to two when the road is on an ascent of one in twenty, and to seventeen to thirteen when the ascent is one in ten. It is, therefore, evident that, to get the full benefit of the power employed upon a railroad, the gradients should be as easy as possible. If, however, the cost of reducing the road to this state, that is, of making the extra cuttings and embankments, be great, the interest of this extra charge may exceed the saving in the cost of the motive power; in this case it would evidently be unwise to expend money for such a purpose, the interest of which must be met either by an increased charge upon the conveyance of goods and passengers, or by a general tax upon the whole commu nity. Taking this view of the subject, it is evident that the solution of the question must depend upon the quantity of goods and passengers conveyed. If the traffic is heavy, a small saving in the cost of traction per ton or per passenger may be sufficient to cover a large amount of interest; but when the traffic is small, and when the cost of locomotive power bears but a small proportion to the sum chargeable asii /• 30 interest, or to the cost of maintaining the road, it is evidently desirable to reduce these items to a minimum. In comparing the cost of constructing a macadamized road with that of making a railroad, when the gradients are the same, all that is required is to determine the relative cost of covering the former with metal, and of laying down the rails on the latter; the items for fencing, drainage, including bridges, culverts, etc., will be the same, or nearly the same, in each, the advantages being a little in favour of the railroad, as, from its narrowness, the width of bridges, culverts, etc., would not be so great as upon the turnpike road. Now the cost of broken stone depends on a variety of circumstances. Mr. Brady, in his evidence before the Committee of the Legislative Assembly, says that it is worth 10 shillings per square yard, or for a road 1 8 feet wide, £3 per running yard, or £5,280 per mile. 1 his statement, however, must have reference to the vicinity of Sydney, and cannot be admitted as an element in determining the cost of such work elsewhere. On the Southern road, the Surveyor estimates the cost of macadamizing at from £2,500 to £3,500 per mile. It will, however, be safer to calculate the actual amount of labour which would be ex- pended m preparing and spreading metal of good quality, and this may be roughly stated as follows J st. Quarrying.—A. man should quarry 2^ cube yards per day, and this quantity will not vary much, whether it be necessary to use powder or not. The cost of quarrying a yard of metal will, therefore, be about two-fifths of the daily wages of a labourer. Li ahin j. \ man will break half a yard good metal per day, or perhaps more, say three-fifths of a yard. The cost then of breaking will be 11 of the daily wages of a labourer. •cfrd. CW of Carting. This would depend upon a variety circumstances j but, taking an average lead of two miles,31 the cost per yard might be put at 4s. Qd., while that of spreading might amount to Is. §d. Summing up these various items^it would seem that the cost of quarrying and breaking would amount to about 12s. 6cL per cube yard. Labour being valued at 6s. §d. per day ; add to this 4s. 6d5. for cartage, Is. Qd. for spreading, and the cost per cube yard would be 18s. 4d!. If the average thickness of metal be taken at six inches, and the width of the road at six yards, one cube yard will cover a running yard of road, and the cost of metalling will be about £1,613 per mile. What then will be the cost of a single line of railway, in cluding, of course, a sufficient number of sidings, &amp;c., to ac commodate the traffic in both directions ? These latter may be- assumed, on an average, to increase the length of the single way, from 1,760 yards to 2,000 yards per mile, and the cost of the work will resolve itself into that of the following items :— First.— Rails and Chairs. Second.— Stone Blocks, or Wooden Sleepers, as bear ers for the Chairs. Third.— Fixing Chairs and laying the Road. Fourth.— Making good the Ballasting and Roadway between the rails. 1st.—Rails and Chairs. As a 35 lb. rail was considered to be sufficient for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway when worked by locomo tive engines, the same weight of rail will be amply sufficient for a mere horse-track ; then 2 x 35 x 2,000 = 140,000 lbs., or say 63 tons will be the weight of rails required for each mile of road ; and this, at £12 per ton, will amount to £756. The chairs, if placed at five feet apart, will weigh about 20 tons, and, allowing for breakages, may be charged at £10 per ton; making a total for chairs and rails, of £956, or say £1,000 per mile.32 2nd.—Stone Blocks, or Wooden Sleepers. In many parts of the country it would be advisable to use stone blocks to carry the chairs ; these were formerly used very generally on railroads in England, but, it was found that the jar of the heavy engine upon them caused displacements and breakages; this, however, would not be the case in a mere horse-road, and the cost for repairs would be very much lessened by the employment of stone instead of wood; but if stone blocks cannot be procured, then cross sleepers at every five feet, carrying a longitudinal bearer 8x6, would answer every purpose. When such bearers are used, the rails might be made very much lighter; but without making any allow ance for this, the cost of sleepers and wooden rails would not exceed £500 per mile. 1,200 Sleepers at Is. 6tZ £ 90 4,000 Cubic feet of squared timber, 8 x 6 at 2s. . . 400 £490 Say £500. By proper arrangements, by making use of steam power, and by applying a variety of mechanical expe dients to the preparation of the timber, this cost might be very much reduced. The cost, then, of the materials of the road would not exceed £1,500. 3rd.—Fixing Chairs and laying Rails. 1 he cost of the labour of doing this may be put at £300 per mile. I believe that the charge for this, on the locomo tive railroad, is about £500; but, looking to the extra care and attention which is required on such a road, I do not think that 1 have under-estimated the cost. 4th.—Making good the Ballasting and Eoadway between the rails. A very heavy item in fixing the rails of a locomotive rail way, is the ' Ballast' as it is called, or the bed upon which the sleepers rest. This should, if possible, be composed32 chairs: i in 8 e ver, would not ost for it •cured, then cross sV; idiaal bearer 8x6,1; t bearers are used,I, r: sepers and wooden ii •ed timber, 8 x Sd imngementSjbjiisr: ring a variety of itik of the timber, is cost, then, oftbmfc ,500.

Gravel is, in fact, the best kind of ballast, and of this material it is usual to place a thickness of 18 inches to 2 feet under the sleepers. This, however, which is almost a matter of necessity when locomotives are used, would be a needless expenditure when the road is intended for horse power. In the former case the road has not only to withstand the action of the load, that is of the goods, and the trucks in which they are conveyed, and this at a speed at least double of that which could ever be attained on a horse road, but it has to withstand the action of the power itself, in the shape of the locomotive engine, which may be represented as equal to a load of from four to six tons upon each wheel, moving with a velocity of from 25 to 30 miles per hour. No precaution can be too great to take, which may enable the road to withstand the action of such a force, whether we look to the permanency of the road itself, or to the fatal effects which must necessarilv ensue from any failure which might cause the train to leave the rails. But in a horse road the action of the disturbing forces is so slight, that when the road is laid upon cross sleep ers, with longitudinal bearers, these might be placed at once on the surface of the ground, and when stone blocks are em ployed, they might be bedded in the soil, no particular pre cautions being taken to ensure their stability. I find that in the American lines, when it has been diffi cult to procure ballast, a ditch has been dug at each side of the road, the soil from which has been banked up so as to cover the centre of the sleeper, but sloped off on each side, leaving the ends of the sleepers exposed in order to allow the rain to draw off rapidly. Looking, therefore, at the difference above stated between the railroad for locomotive, and that for horse power, the if* 1 : &gt; _____34 cost of the ballast may be merged into that of the horse track, the material required for which will on a length of 2,000 yards, allowing a depth of 12 inches and a width of 6 feet, amount to 1333 cubic yards, and taking this at an average of 5s. per yard, the cost will be £334 per mile. Summing up these various items, viz.;— £. 8. d. Rails and Chairs 1,000 0 0 Sleepers or Blocks 500 0 0 Labour, fixing . 300 0 0 Ballast or road (say) 340 0 0 Would give £2,140 0 0 as the cost of forming the track for a railway, while that of macadamizing the turnpike road would amount to £1,613. The difference, or about £527, would be the excess of the cost of the railway above that of the macadamized road, and if the cost of the latter be put at £3,000 per mile, that of the railroad may be taken at £3,500. Having thus arrived at an approximation to the cost of the turnpike road, and the horse railroad, it only remains to determine the cost of a railway for locomotive: for this we have a variety of data. We have the average cost of English and American rail ways ; and we have the actual cost of railways already exe cuted in this Colony; and if the comparatively easy line between Liverpool and Paramatta has cost upwards of £11,000 per mile, we may feel sure that in the more difficult country, where the cuttings must be deeper, the embank ments higher, the bridges more numerous, £12,000 will be a very moderate estimate. The comparison, then, between the different modes alluded to in the former part of this paper, of remedying the evil arising from the miserable condition of our present lines of^naotla,^ . tv ^, and items, ri.- i ij mhi. a^l mi i4i wwldpref^jf ack for t ni^r, lih road Ttjil uitii. 27, would I k ik® t (rf tb maLL'm \ at £3,(1(16 pert 500. q a^ffoee^ crse niir»i n M' : '- ray for jl 003 of BLlS'^* if the coap^: jyjans he ■'*' daaetwi* 51 i iB5i be ' icse sass^ ^ reeatfe^^ sp^r .rf-'' ^diqoci^ 35 communication, so far as the first cost of each is concerned, will stand as follows ;— Turnpike Road . Horse railroad Locomotive railroad First cost per mile. Annual charge for Interest per mile. £ £ 3,000 150 3,500 175 12,000 600 The next matter for consideration will be the annual cost of maintenance of way, as it is termed, namely, that of keeping the road in a proper state of repair, by applying labour when it is needed, and by renewing the materials as they decay. In all cases, the outlay for these purposes must depend, to a certain extent, on the amount of traffic; but, if we as sume this to be such as to require the renewal of the metal upon a macadamized road every ten years, and that of the iron rails of the railway every twenty years, while the wooden sleepers may be taken to last eight years, the relative out lay may be roughly estimated as follows :— On the turnpike road a single station man will, on an average, with light traffic, take charge of four miles of road; and his wages will amount to £100 per annum, or £25 per mile. The total cost of metal has been put at £1,613 ; one- tenth of this, or £161 6s. will be annual cost of the metal, so that the total annual charge per mile for maintenance will, on the turnpike road, be £186 6s. On the horse rail the labour would be trifling in com parison, as the station man would only be called upon to look after the general drainage, and would never have to fill in ruts, etc., however, to make ample provision, two men c 2 1 136 may be allowed to every three miles of road, which, at the ordinary rate of labour, would give £66 10s. 6d. per mile. The charge for rails and chairs has been taken at £1,000 per mile; and as these are supposed to last twenty years, tte annual renewals will cost £50. The charge for sleepers was put at £500 per mile, and if these last eight years, the annual charge for renewals will be £62 lOx. Should stone blocks be used, this charge would almost vanish. I have not made any allowance for the maintenance of the horse track between the rails, as I consider the amount of labour allotted is amply sufficient to make good the very slight damage which would be done by the feet of the horses. The total charge for maintenance of way on the horse rail way will be as follows :— On the locomotive railroad the charge for renewals, as suming the rails and sleepers to last as long as on the horse road, will be 2,000 -r- 20 = £100 per annum per mile for rails, and say 150 -r- 8 = £18 10^. for sleepers. For the cost ot labour we must be dependent upon the data afforded by the returns from the English railroads, and the expe rience which the Paramatta railway will afford. t rem the returns which have been furnished, I find that the contract price for labour only was £16 per mile per fort- night, or £416 per mile per annum, or 1«. 10^. per train mile. In America the cost is about half of this, amounting to ll|(i per train mile, while in England the cost varies from lS'92d. to 3 072tZ.,and the average maybe put at 7*66^. per train mile. Renewal of rails . Do. sleepers Labour . . . . £ s. d. 50 0 0 62 10 0 66 13 4 £179 3 437 The greater the amount of traffic upon the road, the greater, of course, will be the absolute cost of maintenance of way, but the less will be the rate per train mile, as there are several items which are almost constant, or which, at all events, do not vary with the amount of traffic. Under these circumstances, if the charge per mile of road is put at £250 annually, that is at £166 less than is now actually paid on the Paramatta line; and if to this be added the cost of re-placing rails and sleepers, before estimated at £118 105. per mile, the total charge for maintenance of way will be £368 ICte. The proportionate cost, therefore, of the maintenance of way on these three descriptions of road will be as follows :— £ s. d. Turnpike road 186 6 0 Horse railroad 179 3 4 Locomotive road 368 10 0 Having thus established an approximation, at all events, to the two great items of permanent charge on the different kinds of roads, the only question which remains to be investi gated is the actual cost of transport. I mean, the cost of the power employed in haulage; including in such cost all inci dental and contingent expenses, such as the repair and renewal of rolling stock, coaching, traffic and station charges, etc. In entering upon the investigation, I will commence with the locomotive railway; for, with regard to this, we have not only the experience of the English and American railways to guide us, but we are also in possession of the returns of the cost of working the tine of railway from Sydney to Para matta and Liverpool The actual cost of locomotive power may be classified under the following heads :— 1st. Interest of purchase money of rolling stock. 2d. Repair and renewal of do.38 3rd. Cost of working, including wages of Engineers, Drivers, Firemen, etc., and charge for fuel, oil, etc. 4. Station expenses, tliat is, the wages of persons em- ployed in various capacities, but not actually engaged in working the locomotives. The whole of these charges are (with the exception per haps of No. 4) directly proportional to the amount of tbe traffic upon the road. In order, therefore, to estimate their amount, some specific number of passengers, and of tons of goods, must be assumed as likely to pass over the railway. The total tonnage passing up and down the Southern road between Goulburn and Sydney is shown by the annexed return to amount to 30,543 tons. Of this, however, 10,000 tons pass down the railway from Liverpool, and an addi tional 10,000 tons is assumed as the amount of the Camp- bell-town traffic; 10,000 may therefore be assumed as the existing amount of the traffic along the line of road from Campbell-town to Goulburn, a distance of about 90 miles. It is difficult to form any probable estimate of the number of passengers. The replies to queries sent to the mail con tractor show that the maximum capacity of the vehicles em ployed by him is adequate to the conveyance of twenty pas sengers per day, or between six and seven thousand per annum over the whole distance. If, then, we assume 30,000 tons per annum, or there abouts, to be the probable amount of goods traffic from Campbell-town to Goulburn, that is about 100 tons per day up and down, and that the present number of passengers is also trebled, or that 60 per day are conveyed by the different trains, we shall have some definite data upon which to esti mate the relative cost of conveying them by locomotives, or by horse power on railroads, or by horse power upon com mon roads. Basing the estimate of rolling stock required upon the data supplied by Mr. Brady in his report on the comparative39 cost of haulage by steam and horse power, the cost of roll ing stock would stand thus :— £ s. d. 4 Engines at £3,000 12,000 0 0 4 Second-class carriages at £350 1,400 0 0 4 Third Do. at £250 1,000 0 0 4 brake vans at £250 .... 1,000 0 0 30 Waggons at £150 4,500 0 0 £19,900 0 0 Say £20,000. The charge then under the first head of interest of cost of rolling stock will be, interest at 5 per cent, on £20,000= £1,000 or £11 2s. per mile of road. The second and third heads are, in the accounts of En glish railways, combined together, though data are given by which the actual charges for locomotive power can be separated from those for repairs and renewals. On reference to these returns, it would appear that the cost of locomotive power, inclusive of repairs, amounts, on the English lines, to about one shilling per train mile, while the repairs may be averaged at bd. • so that the actual cost of locomotive power is in England about 7d. per train mile. On the Paramatta line, the returns show that the charge for locomotive power, including repairs, was 23.518 per train mile, and if we assume, what was, I believe, the case, that the charge for repairs was unduly enhanced in the particular period to which the return had reference, yet it is very evident that the charge for both working and repairs must be much heavier here than in England. From the returns of English railroads, it would appear that the charge of 7d. per mile for locomotive power would be divided between wages, materials, and superintendence, in the proportion of 2*27 to the first, 4 - 37 to the second, and *36 to the third; while on the Paramatta line the charge for materials was 12*36 per mile, or about three times the amount of the English charge;40 tlie item superintendence amounted to 1*85, or six times that in England, while tlie labour, including the charge for repairs, was 19'308, or nine times the amount of the English charge. Looking at the relative cost of labour here and in England, we may assume, without much risk of error, that the charges in this country will be about three times as heavy as those in England, and, therefore, that the charge for locomotive power would be 3s. per train mile, and if the train miles be assumed to be equivalent to the number of miles actually traversed by goods and passenger trains, running twice a day, the charge will, for two trains per day, be 6s. per mile, or for the year of 313 days £93 18s., or say £95. The fourth item of station expenses averages, in England, about 11 '85 per train mile; on the Paramatta line the charge was 20*11, and if we take 18 - 00, as the fair amount, the total charge would be £46 19s. per mile. The cost, therefore, of working the locomotive line will be— £. s. d. Interest per mile 1120 Locomotive power 95 0 0 Coaching charges and station expenses 46 19 0 £153 1 0 The cost of traction upon a horse railway may be infer red, so far as the goods traffic is concerned, from a return which has been furnished to me by the Engineer of the Australian Agricultural Company, Mr. Whyte; as well as by information obtained by me, relative to the working of a contract system, previous to that now adopted. Prom Mr. W hyte^s paper, it appears that the actual cost of moving 18,565 tons of coal an average distance of r936 miles, and of hauling back the empty waggons amounted to 2-83 per ton per mile one way, or 1-415 for each mile travel led by the power; in this charge is included an item for the repair of harness, and also an allowance, though apparently too small, for the depreciation of horse stock.41 By the returns formerly procured by me, it appears that the contractor who supplied the whole power delivered 516 tons daily, which were equivalent to 1418 tons drawn one mile by 36 horses; each horse, therefore, drew 39 tons net weight, one mile daily, besides taking back the empty wag gon to the pits. Starting, however, from the data afforded by these returns, we may infer that one horse will move from 50 to 60 tons daily over one mile of road ; and as, according to the supposition upon which the former calculation was based, 100 tons have to be conveyed daily over each mile, two horses per mile will be required for the goods traffic, and, allowing for losses, accidents, etc., 2^ horses per mile of road would be a sufficient stock. The carriages or trucks for goods would contain about three tons each, and about 150 of these would be required for the conveyance of 100 tons daily, over a distance of 90 miles. For the passenger traffic of sixty persons, backwards and forwards daily, four carriages would be required in constant work, and two additional, to provide against contingencies. These carriages would be drawn by two horses, and the number of these required to secure the regular working of the passenger traffic would be, allowing for contingencies, about 60 ; eighteen sets of harness would be wanted. The capital expended in what may be termed the rolling stock, would be— £ s. d. 6 Carriages for passengers, at £250 each 150 0 0 60 Horses at £35 .... 2,100 0 0 18 Sets of Harness at £15 . 270 0 0 150 Goods Trucks at £100 . 15,000 0 0 210 Horses at £25 .... 5,250 0 0 180 Sets of Harness at £3 10s. 630 0 0 Say £25,000. £24,750 0 042 The interest of £25^000 at 5 per cent, would be £1250 • £13 18 .9. per mile of road. Repairs and renewals of the carriages may be put at 10 per cent, on the cost, as may also that of the harness ; while the horse stock must be put at 20 per cent. The charge for repairs and renewals therefore will be— £ Passengers' Carriages . . . 1,500 Goods trucks 16,000 HarneS3 { 630 £17,400 10 per cent, on £17,400 = 1,740 Horse, passengers .... 2,100 Horses '] Do. Goods j o ^250 £7,350 20 per cent, on 7^350 1,470 Total repairs and renewals £3,210 h-qual to £35 13s. 4dL per mile of road. 1 he cost ol working the traffic so far as the goods are concerned, lias been shown to be rather less than r415 for labour, maintenance of horses, shoeing, etc. Let it be put, however, at \\d. per ton per mile, then, as 30,000 tons have to bo conveyed in the course of the year, the cost per mile will be £187 10s. 1 he cost of working the passenger traffic may be roughly estimated as follows :— £ s. d. 4 Coachmen at £180 720 0 0 12 Grooms at £108 1.296 0 0 48 Horses' keep at £50 2,400 0 0 £4,626 0 0 or £51 8s. per mile.42 WO at 5 10 wie torse i for repairs and: ' e8 • • . ij i 27() si 17,351) IM y lie traffic sofarisi 1 : ra to be ratk btk owes, dioeiag, etc, It- per mile, to, as HI nrse of ttejear,!^ ivfk' 50 . 15 • 0 ■ 43 The charge thus for working will be as follows :— £ s. d.

If, therefore, the cost of working be put at £300 per mile, this will leave an ample margin for all charges. The cost of the conveyance of goods on a turnpike road has been put at 9hd. per ton per mile; this, however, includes the charge for tolls, which is supposed to be sufficient to pay the cost of keeping the road in repair, and also the annual interest of the money borrowed to construct it. The charge for locomotive power would thus be reduced to 7^d. per ton per mile, which, for 30,000 tons, would give £637. 10s. per mile for the goods traffic only. The cost for passenger traffic would be about double that on the horse rail, or £140 per mile, giving a total of £1,077 10s. per mile for working expenses. The general comparison between the cost of conveying the given quantity of goods and passengers, by either of the three kinds of conveyance, will stand as follows :— Interest Maintenance . Cost of working . Turnpike Soads. Railroad. Horse. Locomotive. £. s. d. 150 0 0 186 6 0 1,077 10 0 £ s. d. 175 0 0 179 3 0 300 0 0 £. s. d. 600 0 0 368 10 0 153 1 0 1,413 16 0 654 3 0 1,121 11 044 An analysis of the above table will show that, while on the turnpike road, and on the horse railroad, the interest of the first cost of the road will be paid by a charge on the traffic, amounting to one penny per ton per mile on goods, and \d. per mile on passengers, the charge on the locomotive railway, to cover the interest of capital, will be 3^. per ton per mile on goods, and 2d. per passenger per mile. Taking, however, the last item, namely, the cost of work ing, the charge on the turnpike road will be 7^. per ton per mile for goods, and l^d. per passenger per mile (this latter charge is too low, but I have been anxious not to exag gerate) ; on the horse railroad, the charge for working would be \\d. per ton per mile for goods, andfc?. per passenger per mile; while on the locomotive line, the charge for working would be less than one penny per ton per mile for goods, and \d. per mile for passengers. As the traffic increases upon the road, the advantage which the horse road possesses over the locomotive road will diminish rapidly. As the interest of capital expended is a constant quantity, any increase in the traffic will diminish the charge, per ton or per passenger, which will be required to pay this interest. It is evident, however, that a large amount of business must be done upon a railroad, in order to cover the fixed and perma nent charges upon it. The fixed charges must, in this country, be heavier than they are either in England or America, for labour is much dearer here than in either of these two countries, and the inter est of capital is certainly higher than in England; though not, probably, than it is in America. It becomes, then, a matter of the utmost importance to us, in deciding upon the adoption of some improved system of internal communication, to weigh carefully the various circumstances which may operate in developing such an interchange of products and people from one part of the country to another, as will defray all the charges upon such improved communication.

Now, we may at once set aside the example of England and the United States. The circumstances of those two countries are so diametrically opposed to those in which we find ourselves placed, that to reason from that which has happened in either of them from the construction of railroads, to what will follow from the construction of similar works here, would lead us into error. The position, however, of the British North American Colonies is so far different from that of the mother country, or the United States, as might induce a belief that a system which has been applied with success in Canada, may possibly answer here. Is there, then, any such an analogy between the present state and future prospects of New South Wales, and those of Canada, as to justify us in expending upon our internal communications a sum larger than our present necessities require, in the confident expectation that, in a few years, the traffic upon such lines of communication will increase to an extent sufficient to enable us to reduce the charge for trans port to a level with those which would be sufficient to pay the whole charge upon a cheaper system, but one fully ade quate to our present wants ? The North American Colonies, extending, as they do, from the Atlantic to Lake Superior, cover an area of 455,000 square miles, and support a population of 2^ millions. These Colonies border for a length of about 1,800 miles upon the United States of America, with which they carry on an in creasing trade, and the population of which amounts to up wards of 30 millions. The communication of the North i40 American Colonies with England and Europe can be made iu ten days by steam, and in twenty -five or thirty by sailing vessels. The land, especially that in the vicinity of lakes Erie and Ontario, is of good quality, well calculated for the growth of wheat, and other cereal crops, for which there is a ready demand, either in the Colonies themselves, or in tk United States, or in England and Europe. Land, therefore, especially that in the vicinity of rail- roads, is eagerly bought up, and brought under cultivation, as there is a certainty that, although the price of wheat may be influenced to a certain extent by the quality of the harvest in England, or on the continent of Europe, the value of the crop will be sufficient, at all times, to remunerate a fanner who pays ordinary attention to his land. The construction of a railway, by lessening the cost of conveying produce to market, encourages, both in Canada and the United States, the settlement of the land in its vi- cinity; thousands flock to avail themselves of the advantages thus held out to them, and the result is an amount of traffic which is not only sufficient to defray the cost of working the railway, but also to pay the interest on its construction. If, however, the settler in Canada had to depend upon the con sumption ot Montreal and Quebec, that is, if he had not the Certainty of a better, or at all events, a larger market for his pioduce, the amount of land disposed of would be much less, and the passenger and goods traffic upon the railways would not l)e sufficient to justify the cost of constructing them. In New South Wales, the population, by the last Census, was 289,000, ami the annual increase may be taken to be8 per cent. Ihis population is spread over an area of about 230,000 square miles. There is a large quantity of good land in various parts of the Colony, well adapted for the production () i cereal and other crops; but the distance is too great to allow the settler to look to the English and Europ ean market for the disposal of his surplus produce. He has the markets of .146 ^ ^gland 0,1 i« ''entrt,™^ ™ th e Colonies^, ^glandande^ specially tkt in tla | t up, and brongiit b .

He must, then, so far as the sale of cereal produce is concerned, depend upon the home market; and this, though the population is increasing rapidly, affords but a limited demand. He may, it is true, if the cost of con veying his produce to the coast be much lessened, compete with the farmers of the adjoining Colonies in the market of Melbourne, but the demand there is not large, nor is it per manent, as the Government of Victoria is already taking steps to construct railroads, and facilitate the means of communi cation throughout a country, much of which is admirably fitted for the production of cereals. In estimating, therefore, the increase which is likely to take place in the existing traffic upon any given line of road, we must not merely be able to say that it opens up a tract of country admirably suited for farming operations, but we must be prepared to show that there will be adequate inducements to settlers to purchase and occupy such lands, productively, in numbers sufficient to create a traffic for the railway. In some parts of the country, as, for instance, in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, there will be an increasing trade in coal, which will be brought by the railroad to Newcastle^ as the port of shipment. In other parts of the country there may be, and indeed there are, local sources of traffic, which only require cheap means of conveyance to admit of a large development; but the principal receipts of the railroads in New South Wales must, for many years to come, be derived from the movement of pastoral and agricultural produce from the interior to the port of shipment, or place of consumption, and supplies of different kinds, and of imported articles of comfort or luxury, from the capital to the settler. The pastoral products do not admit of any rapid develop ment, though their extension is certain, and may be eventually very great; and I have already shown that as the agricultural48 |: II i products can only command a limited market, their increase cannot be dependent upon to an extent sufficient to create a traffic for any great length of railway. I am, therefore, of opinion that the analogy between Canada and NewSouth Wales is not close enough to justify the inference that rail, ways will succeed here, because they have done so there. The conclusions which I consider myself justified in draw- ing from the facts and calculations exhibited in this paper are as follows :— 1st. The cost of transport by a turnpike road is in ex cess of that by a railroad, whether such road be worked by horse power or steam. 2nd. The cost of steam power is much less than that of horse power upon railroads, but this cheapness is, with a limited amount of traffic, more than compensated for by the increased cost of construction and maintenance, if such roads be compared with those on which hJrse power may be used. ord. That the circumstances of the Colony are not such as to lead us to expect so large a development of internal traffic as would compensate, by the saving on the cost of motive power caused by the employment of steam, for the increased charge for the interest of capital, and maintenance of road. 4th. That the railway on which horse power is used would, under the present, and probable future circumstances of the Co.om for several years to come, be the cheapest means of conveyance both for passengers and goods; and that it would be, therefore, advisable to adopt it on all the main lines of communication.APPENDIX. EAILEOADS. EESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS AT NEWCASTLE. Cost of 1^ miles near Newcastle including land, laving, originally with wood, and relaying with iron rails, 35 lbs. to the yard, £9,500 or £6,332 per mile. The next mile cost £1,800. The contract price for the carriage of the coal from the pits to Newcastle, and delivery on board ship, is at the rate of 1^. Zd. per ton, or, on an average, about 5^^. per ton per mile, The lengths of the branches are 3, 2\, and 2 miles, but the same price is paid for all. For this, the Contractor finds horses, harness, drivers, grease, and men and boys attending the Staiths, but he does not keep the waggons or the permanent way in repair. The Con tractor delivers about 516 tons daily, of which 260 tons come 2£ miles, and 256 come 3 miles, equal to 1,418 tons drawn one mile. To do this work the Contractor has 40 horses, four of which are kept at Newcastle, to haul the coal up to the Staiths. He employs seven drivers, five men at the Staiths, to assist in the shipping the coal, and four boys. In order to find the actual charge for locomotive power, the four horses kept to work the Staith, and the five men and four boys unemployed for the same purpose, shonld be deducted from the establishment, the estimate for which will then stand as follows :— for this sum 3,096 tons can be drawn from the pits to Newcastle, or 8,508 tons can be drawn one mile, the actual cost being Ifrf., or a little more, per ton per mile. To this, however, must be added— 36 Horses at say £1 per week 7 Drivers at £3 ... . Grease for waggons . . . Boy for greasing .... £ s. d. 36 0 0 21 0 0 4 10 0 10 0 £62 10 0 Dtmmmmm 50 1st. Interest upon the capital of the Contractors, which may be calculated as follows: £ s. d. 36 Horses at 1,4^) 0 0 Harness for do. at £5 180 0 0 £1,620 0 0 and this at 10 per cent, will amount to £162 per annum. 2d. Sinking Fund for replacing stock, at 30 per cent, per an num, £486. 3d Supervision or payment for Contractor s labour, say £500 per annum. 4th. Interest of cost of rolling stock; this stock for the convey ance of 120 tons of coal at each trip would amount to 70 carriages, and if each carriage is put at £50, this will give £3,500; interest upon this at 6 per cent., £210. 5th. Eepairs and sinking fund, say 15 per cent, upon above amount, £520. If all these items were added together, the amount will be as fol lows : — Locomotive power . . Interest Sinking Fund . . . . Supervision Interest of Eolling Stock Repairs and replacement 6210 £ . 3,250 . 162 . 486 . 500 . 210 . 525 £5,133 or say £100 per week, for which, as has been shown before, 8,508 tons can be drawn one mile. The cost, therefore, of conveying goods upon a railway by horse power may be put at 2-82, or rather more than 2$d. per ton per mile; this includes taking the carriages back. The experience gained by the working of the Newcastle coal mines is sufficient to show the relative advantages of the different kinds of roads. It appears that the coal was formerly brought into Newcastle by carts along ordinary bush road, and thret. horses brought in twenty tons per week. When a wooden tramway was laid down, four horses brought in 30 tons per day, or 180 tons per week. When iron rails are substituted for the wooden tram, fi ve horses can bring in 100 tons per day, or 600 tons per week. Thus,offej''- bosh ^'' xa^ a ' 51 on a bush road, a horse will draw 7 tons per week. On a wooden tram, a horse will draw 45 tons, and on an iron Eailway, 120 tons per week. This is conclusive against the employment of wood, at all events, as a tramway. The friction would possibly be less upon an edge rail of wood, but still the difference between wood and iron would pro bably double the cost of traction, and altogether neutralize any bene- fit which might be derived from the comparative cheapness of wood. In Mr. Bell s paper there is an estimate of the comparative cost of horse and steam traction; and there is no question but that, with such an amount of traffic, steam power would be much cheaper than horse power. According to his calculation, the engine would have to travel 288 miles per week. Now, the cost in England per train mile, including repairs, etc., is 1^. 3^. per mile. The experience of the Paramatta railroad gives, I believe, 4,s. 6d. per train mile. If we assume 2^. 6^. as a fair price, looking to the great expense of every- thing in the Colony, 288 x 2'6 20 = £36, the cost per week of locomotive power, etc.; and as 3,096 tons have been brought down the cost per ton will be 2-79 pence, or the cost per ton per mile will be, as near as possible, 1 penny. This, however, does not include interest upon rolling stock, including engines and carriages; neither does it provide for repairs and replacements, or for supervision.* In fact, the cost of conveying about 160,000 tons per annum would be so far as mere traction is concerned, by steam, £666 13s. 4,d. per mile, and by horse power, £1,166 13«. 4td. Against this, however, must be placed the interest of the outlay on the construction of the road; which, if put at 12,000 for the steam road, and 4,000 for the horse road, would be £600 and £200, and the increased cost of maintenance of way, which for the steam road, may be put at £250 per mile, and for the horse road at £100. The comparison will therefore stand as follows ;— Steam. Horse. Interest . 600 200 Traction 666 1,166 Maintenance of way 250 100 1,516 1,466 * In fact, it is the mere cost of locomotive power, andjt must, therefore be compared with the horse power, which lias been shown to cost rather more than per mile.52 With a smaller amount of traffic, such as is likely for many years to pass over the Southern and Western roads, the comparison will be much more in favour of horse power.

The principles which regiilate the comparison which has been drawn, in the former sections of this paper, between the cost of transport on different kinds of roads in Australia, are of general application; and, looking to the fact that the Grovernment of India, although it has expended large sums upon roads and railways, as well as upon canals, when oppor tunities of constructing these were afforded, has yet many thousand miles of road to make, and fresh lines of communi cation to open, I cannot but think that an inquiry into the circumstances which influence the cost of transport in India, and a comparison of the advantages presented by different modes of communication, would be useful, not merely to the Government, but to the capitalists who may be disposed to invest money in works of this kind, and who, of course, would wish to derive from such investment the largest returns. Such an inquiry and such an investigation will make a very useful corollary to the conclusions deduced, in the former sections, from English and Australian experience, and will, I think, tend to prove that the local features of the country, the character of its climate, the peculiarities of the people, and the nature of their industrial system, influence, far more largely than many are apt to think, the discussion of questions which would seem, to most, to be simple matters of engineer ing experience. Before, however, I enter upon this inquiry and compari son, I must premise that the facts which I propose to classify and arrange, as the basis of any inferences I may draw, have reference to the Presidency of Madras, which occupies by far the largest portion of the southern extremity of the Penin sula of India. There is, however, a marked similarity be tween the state of things in the different Presidencies; and, with some trifling allowances for local peculiarities, I think that what I have to say about railroads in Madras will be found applicable to the whole of India.56 GENERAL ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY. The Peninsula of India extends from Cape Comorin in latitude 8° N. to latitude 2() c or 21° N., at which point its width is about 14° of longitude or 800 miles or thereabouts. A range of mountains from 6,000 to 8,000 feet high runs parallel to the Western Coast at a distance of about 50 or 60 miles from the sea. This range is broken through at one point where there is a gap of about 40 miles in width, the height of which is not more than 1,200 feet above the sea. The fall of the ground to the westward is therefore rapid, while, speak ing generally, there is a gradual and much more gentle slope to the eastward, which is interrupted, occasionally, by abrupt secondary ridges rising to a height of 2,000 or 3,000 feet. Nearer the East Coast the land slopes gradually towards the sea, at the rate of about 4 feet per mile, in great plains, where there is but little to catch the eye, or to relieve the monotony of the landscape. It follows, from what has been said above, that the rivers flowing to the West Coast have short and rapid courses ; though, as they flow through a narrow belt of alluvial soil near the sea, they are often navigable for small craft for some miles from the mouth. Those that flow to the eastward have a much longer course, and, as they drain a much larger area'of country, they bring down, during the rainy season, a very heavy body of water; as, however, the supply is but temporary, as will be seen when I speak of the climate, these rivers do not afford any facilities for water communication in their unimproved state. CLIMATE. The position of the Peninsula, within the northern tropic, exposes it to the action of the periodical rains. These are modified in their action by the relation of the Peninsula to the great mass of the continent from which it projects, and as sume the form of two distinct monsoons. The south-western, which is by far the most extensive in its action, commences about the middle of May, and, so far as the Peninsula of India is concerned, expends its force principally upon the West Coast, and the range of mountains parallel to it, where, ^ifaotkiag - | KwfekiaEy : iOtilf; 0/ during the montlas of June^ July, August, and part of Sep- tember, tliere is a steady down-pour with an occasional break; the average rainfall may be put at 180 inches. I to 8,13 iV Of course a large proportion of this water returns rapidly to the sea on the West Coast; the effect being to lessen the saltness of the sea to such an extent as to kill the fish, and all the plants which are naturalized in salt water, for several miles from the coast, and to cause thereby a most disagree able putrescent effluvium along the coast, and for three or four miles out to sea. A portion of the rain of the south-west monsoon is dis charged upon the eastern slopes of the mountain range, and drains into the water-courses which form the heads of the large rivers, such as the Godavery, Kistnah, and Cauvery, which discharge themselves into the Bay of Bengal; causing heavy floods in the lower portions of these rivers. In Octo ber the wind veers to the northward of east, and is called the north-east monsoon. It brings with it the rain which it has sucked up in the Bay of Bengal, and discharges it upon the eastern slopes of the Peninsula. The amount, howevei, of this discharge, which continues at irregular intervals through November and December, is not nearly so great as that of the south-west monsoon. The average of twenty years gives thirty-one inches as the amount of rain at Madras during Jio north-east monsoon, and further inland the average is much less, not exceeding thirteen inches. Rain may be said to fall from May to December in some part or other of the Peninsula; but the 4| or 5 months from. January towards the end of May, may be termed emphatically the dry season. No vegetation takes place, except in situations where water can be found to irrigate the soil; the sky is cloudless; there is nothing to impede the action of the sun upon the ground, which is baked to the hardness Oi a brick where the aluminous element prevails, and is reduced to dust whci e its consistency is less compact.58 CULTIVATION. From tlie foregoing description of the climate, it may be inferred that the productiveness of the country depends alto gether upon the periodical rains. Should nature pause in her action for a single season, the result of this short cessation would be such a wide-spread famine as would destroy mil lions upon millions of people, and reduce the country to a desert. Complaints are commonly made of the insufficiency of the monsoon; and comparisons are drawn between the existing state of things and that of which history or tradi tion hands down the records, where the rain fell more regularly and in larger quantities. I am disposed to give some credit to these statements, and to trace the diminution in the quantity of rain to the mode in which the country has been denuded of timber. To return, however, to the character of the cultivation as influenced by the climate. On the West Coast the rain falls with such regularity, and the atmosphere generally is so moist, that few or no attempts are made to retain the water discharged upon the range of mountains bordering the coast. On the east side of these mountains, however, the case is very different. Here the rain is scanty and irregular, and care is taken to secure as much as possible of the drainage of the country. In every w T ater-course, or line of drainage, dams will be seen following each other in regular succession, till all or nearly all of the drainage water is caught, and retained for agricultural purposes; the surplus, which finds its way into the rivers, is again stopped by anicuts or dams con structed across them, from distance to distance, and channels are taken from above these dams by which the water of the river is distributed as extensively as possible. When all this has been done, there is but a small proportion of the cultivated land which is susceptible of irrigation; the remainder is de pendent upon the ordinary action of the rains, and is sown with what are termed ' dry cropsnamely, various kinds ot millet, and raghi, and also with oil seeds, grain, and otherable. 59 leguminous plants. This dry cultivation imposes upon the farmer the obligation of completing his agricultural operations rapidly : he cannot plough before the first rains have softened the ground; he cannot sow till he is pretty certain of conti nual showers of rain. The result is that he is compelled to maintain, or at all events to employ, a pair of bullocks for every five, or, at the least, for every eight acres of land which he cultivates, as he would not be able, with less animal power, to carry through the various ploughings and hoeings which the land demands. The crop springs up rapidly under the influence of rain and of a sun nearly vertical, and is ready for reaping in four or five months. It is then reaped, trodden out by bullocks, as was done in the time of Moses, and win nowed by the wind in a manner as old fashioned as the threshing. When all this has been done, the farmer, unless he has land which he can irrigate, and from which he can get a second crop, has no work for his bullocks during the five or six months of the dry season; they are, consequently, employed in conveying produce to market, and the farmer or cultivator, leaving his land to take care of itself (which it does by producing a plentiful crop of coarse grass and weeds) attaches his bullocks to a light cart or bandy, and becomes a common carrier, being satisfied, of course, with very small profits, as every penny which he receives, in addition to the amount required to maintain his bullocks, is clear gain. POPULATION. The population of the Madras Presidency may be put at 24,500,000, of which about 16,800,000 are employed in agri culture. About 450,000 are congregated in Madras and its suburbs. There are, however, few large towns, though in each district there are three or four towns, about which the popu lation congregates more densely than in the rural districts. As a general rule, the population is more generally dif fused over the face of the country than is the case in England,where the agricultural portion of the community forms a much smaller portion of the whole than is the case in India. WAGES. A necessary result of this dissemination of the people^and of their employment in the rude processes of agriculture, is that wages are low everywhere. The capital expended by the different Companies upon Railways and irrigation works has, by increasing the demand for labour, raised, locally, the rate of wages ; but, even now, in parts of the country a little distant from the lines of Railway from 2| Rupees to 4 Eupees per month or from 2^d. to 3d. per day, may be considered as the ordinary and average rate of wages; while, generally speaking, the whole of the agricultural labour is paid for in kind. The hire of a pair of bullocks and a man to drive them, and to plough at the same time, is 5 annas or 7^d. per day. ROADS. Though men and cattle may be hired at a very low rate, as shown above, yet the cost of transporting commodities must depend very much upon the character of the road over which the traffic is to pass. The main lines of road throughout the Presidency are, generally speaking, in a fair state of repair, much money having been spent upon them. The principal obstacles to ready communications are the nullahs and water courses, many of which are not bridged; during the rainy season these are torrents altogether impassable; while in the dry season, the river beds are filled with a loose drifting sand, across which the ordinary carts or bandies, carrying about half a ton, require to be assisted by many men. The cross roads are in pretty good order, for the character of the traffic which passes along them; indeed, during the dry season, roads though deep in dust, do not oppose any great obstacle to the movement of goods or produce. A great proportion of the work of transport is accordingly done in that season; the cost of conveyance being about 2^ annas or 3|d!. per ton per mile.61 During the rainy season the cost of conveyance is much enhanced; in the first place, the roads are soft and damaged by the rain; the bridges are carried away by floods, cul verts blown up, etc. The actual labour and risk of convey ance is therefore much greater. In the second place, the rainy season being the working period of the agriculturists, the whole of the animal power of the ryot is expended upon his cultivation, and he cannot spare any to be employed up on road traffic, and there is, therefore; less competition. To set against this, however, there is less traffic at that time of year; and I am disposed to consider the figures above given as the cost of conveyance, and which were taken from a re turn furnished by the Commissary General of the contract price for Government transport, to be a fair average for the whole year. RAILBOADS. Of these, the Madras or South-Western line is completed from coast to coast, a distance of 406 miles. The North western, which is eventually to communicate with Bombay, is open for a distance of 41 miles from its junction with the Madras line. The Great Southern of India line is finished from Negapatam to Trichinopoly, a distance of about 80 miles, but it has yet to be connected with the Madras line by an exten sion of about 80 miles, which will meet the South-West line at a point about 250 miles from Madras. A branch trom the Madras line, about 80 miles in length, leads to the Military station of Bangalore : this is just completed. When the whole of these lines are finished, there will be a complete chain ol Railway communication connecting the principal Military stations in this Presidency with the great depot at Madras; and this latter will communicate directly with Bombay. CANALS. Of these there are but few. The Irrigation channels in the deltas of the Kistnah and Godavery are used with great advantage for local traffic; and there is a coast canal, con-62 necting the backwaters of some of the rivers to the north and south of Madras; while the Irrigation Company has on hand a project for completing a line of water communication between Kurnool, on the Toombuddra. and the sea on the East Coast As a general rule, however, the country is altogether nn- fitted for this kind of communication, owing to the difficulty of securing, either at or below the summit levels, l sufficient supply of water to furnish the lockage, and to meet the very large demand on account of evaporation. I have given this short sketch of the Madras Presidency, and of the existing means of communication, in order to fa cilitate the comparison which it will be necessary to make between the result of the Eailway system here and elsewhere. In the earlier sections of this paper, I have laid great stress upon the indirect benefits arising out of the Railway system; which, both in England and Australia, afford a full compensation to the country at large for the capital sunk in the Railway. The holders of Railway shares are losers, of course, to the extent of the difference between the dividend paid, and the ordinary interest upon the capital invested; but every man who travels by rail, and every man who has goods to send to market, saves a very large percentage of the amount he would have had to pay, had his means of communication been limited to turnpike roads. In India, however, so tar as the conveyance of goods is concerned, the indirect benefit is by no means so great as that which is enjoyed by English or Australian merchants. Here the cost ot moving goods is about 2f d. per ton per mile on the road, while on the rail it may be put at that is, the cost per rail is to that per road as 2 to 5, while in ^New South Wales it is as 1 to 4, and in England 1 to 5. The benefit to travellers in India is very great; the facili- tie^s afforded by the Railway have made thousands travel, who in former times never dreamed of moving from their homes.Mrnmmmmmmmmmm&amp;mmmm 62 ^^^riversioi, *^ k; , 3 WaterC0 ®lB^. and the' % the i ^cation, w the summit i eff i. elocka gMrfto fe: e vaporatioii. ii it will ! nesr this paper, I l®f iand and Anstrali-, at large for tie a; ;. )f Railway tes iiffereEce betwEt by rail, and erera ives aTeirkpfts kd to pay, W bs to tarnpie roj®. fit is bnome® gli?li orlnstralia' wds is about ie rail it 1 to 4 and in Sr India is ven p' 63 Stilly however, the poverty of the people, the very low wages which they receive, taken in connection with the fact that a very large proportion of such wages is paid in kind, would seem to point to the conclusion that years must elapse before any very great extension of passenger traffic will take place, except in the vicinity of large towns. At the present low fare of | of a penny per mile for 3rd class passengers, the Madras cooly would only be able to travel 9^ miles for his daily wages; while an English labourer would earn enough in one day to carry him 30 miles. A reduction in the Madras rates would, I have no doubt, increase the number of passengers; but it is very questionable whether it would increase the net receipts. If, indeed, the cost of working the Railway in India bore the same ratio to the cost of working in England, as the rate of wages in India does to that in England, the lowness of the Madras rate would not have much influence on its net receipts; but in India the cost of freight has to be added to that of the Coal or Coke used ; the wages of skilled labour, as Engine Drivers, etc., are higher than in England; and though the ordinary labour employed about the stations, and on the maintenance of way, is cheaper than in England, it is not cheaper in proportion to the difference of wages, for one Englishman will probably do the work of at least three Natives. On the whole, it will, I think, hardly admit of a doubt that the amount of traffic required to pay the interest of the capital expended upon the construction of the Rail way, as well as to defray the costs and charges of mainte nance of way, and of locomotive power, must be far greater in India than in England and elsewhere. Now the interest of capital is one of the heaviest charges against the proceeds of Railway traffic, as has been shown in the earlier sections of this paper; and when the traffic is comparatively light, and not likely to increase to any great ex tent, it may be more to the advantage of the Government, and of the country generally, that a description of road should be64 constructed which, involving a smaller outlay of capital, but requiring a somewhat more costly description of locomotive power, would, at a charge little, if at all, in excess of that of the Railway, furnish a return sufficient to keep the road in thorough repair, pay the interest of the capital expended upon its construction, and provide an amount of tractive power fully adequate to the wants of the people, though the time expended would, of course, be very much in excess of that required by the locomotive line. I propose, then, in the remainder of this section, to in vestigate carefully the relation between the outlay and the returns upon various kinds of roads in the Presidency of Madras; namely, the Railway worked by locomotive engines; the Railway worked by animal power; and the macadamized road. The first step towards this comparison must be tie determination of the amount of passenger and goods traffic which is to be taken as a standard quantity; and in order to simplify the calculations, aud, indeed, to substitute matter of fact for matter of inference, I propose to take the amount of traffic upon some given line, or portion of a line of existing Railway, as this standard. J he Madras or South- West line of Railway, extending from Madras to Beypore, a distance of 406 miles, partakes too much of the character of a great Trunk line to justify the adoption of the whole, or of any portion of it, as a standard of comparison, whether as to outlay, or as to the amount of traffic; but the North-West line, or the portion of it already completed, viz. 41 miles, may be fairly looked upon, at pre sent, in the light of a branch ; and an inquiry into the cost ot moving the passengers and goods, stated to have passed over this line, by some more simple system of conveyance, will afford satisfactory data as to the relative advantages of Railways or other roads. I may observe tliat the Madras Railway, though it only paid, during the first half of 1863, interest to the amount of64 gas '''■■Mi.*; m sufficient - res t of thecal uch ii] lent. excess of isi,; ■emainder ofdusj ■ion betweeitbte- ' of roads in le y worked by bitii, ial power; and k is this compw: it of passengerdf d, indeed, to sate!

It is only necessary to say that, with an amount of traffic equal to 595,000 passen gers, and 96,000 tons of goods in the half year, the amount of interest was only, as stated above, *66 per cent, for the half year, so that 1,200,000 passengers and about 200,000 tons of goods would only pay the cost of traction, of maintenance of way, and 1^ per cent, upon the outlay of capital. The following is an abstract of the nature and amount of the traffic on the North-West line for the half year ending 30th June, 1863; and the numbers given will, when doubled, form the standard amount of traffic upon which the calcula tion of the cost of conveyance on the different kinds of roads will be based; the actual cost of the working of the Railway being taken.

The second class of passengers will con sist of 152,000, and the goods will be taken as 32,000 tons. I will now proceed to enter upon a detailed examination of the cost of construction, of maintenance of way, and of locomotive power upon the macadamized road, upon the Railway for animal power, and upon the Railway for locomotive power, with reference to the above amount of traffic. E66 I Ist. MACADAMIZED ROAD. CONSTRUCTION. The data as to tlie cost of constructing sucli a road as this have been furnished by the Public Works Department^ and the amount given below may be considered a fair average of the cost of such roads throughout the principal parts of the Presidency. Width of road 30 feet. Width of metalling 24 „ £ s. d. Cost of earthwork 166 14 0 Do. of metalling 163 16 0 Bridges and Culverts .... 302 14 0 Sundries 40 0 0 £673 4 0 If an addition be made to this sum for the cost of superin tendence, etc., bringing it up to £750 per mile run, this will be an ample allowance for any contingency. 2nd. RAILWAY FOR HORSE POWER. consteuction. The cost of the earthwork, and of the bridges and cul verts, would be rather less on the railroad than on the maca damized road; for, while it is not intended to modify the gradients in any way, or to add to the cuttings and embank- nients, except on very special occasions, the width of the road may be less. I do not, however, propose to make any deduc tions on this account, but shall assume the cost of the earth work and bridges and ballasting, at the same sum as given for the macadamized road, viz. £750 per mile; setting the metalling against the ballast of the Railway. The cost, there- tore, of the railroad will be found by adding to the cost of the macadamized road, that of the purchase of rails, chairs, and sleepers, and that of the labour of fixing them.67 h DtK 1 i f ti ill; iatrf - In the second section of this paper^ I have assumed that a rail of 35 to the yard would be required; this was the weight of the rail used at first on the Manchester and Liverpool line; but it seems to me that, for horse traction, a rail of 28 lbs. to the yard would be amply strong enough; and as 2,000 yards, or an addition of 240 yards to the mile, will be sufficient to cover all sidings, etc., 2 x 28 x 2,000 = 112,000 lbs. or 60 tons per mile, will be the weight of the rails. These can be delivered at Madras at £8 10s. per ton, and an additional 30s. per ton, making a total of £10 per ton, will cover the charge for conveyance, so that £500 will be the cost per mile of the rails delivered upon the road. Timber sleepers have been found to decay rapidly in this climate; I should therefore lay much greater stress than I have done in the description of Australian railways, and upon the employment of stone blocks as supports for the rail: in many parts of this Presidency, when the gneiss crops out on the surface, the stone block would be far cheaper in first cost, and far more durable than any other description of sleeper; but, as these may not be attainable generally, I propose to allow for the use of the iron pot sleepers, which have been employed on the railway. For the horse traction line these may be made lighter than for the locomotive line, but I propose to allow for the same weight and price, that is £1 per pair of sleepers with the connecting tie rod. I shall allow, however, for a bearing of five, instead of four feet: the cost, under these conditions, of chairs and sleepers will be £1,200 per mile. The cost of laying the railway may be put, as on the loco motive lino, at 4&lt;^d. per yard run; the cost for 2,000 yards would therefore be £37 10s. In order to make the action of this railroad perfect, it should be provided with a line of Telegraph; and the cost of this, judging from the amount expended upon that on the Madras line of railroad, will be £90 per mile. e 2G8 The whole cost of this railroad for animal power per mile will be as follows ;— £ s. d. Earthwork^ including ballast or metal . 330 10 0 Bridges, Culverts, etc 302 10 0 Rails 500 0 0 Chairs and Sleepers 1,200 0 0 Fixing Rails 87 10 0 Telegraph 90 0 0 Stables and rest Houses 50 0 0 Sundries 40 0 0 Superintendence, etc 76 0 0 £2,627 0 0 LOCOMOTIVE RAILWAY. The cost of this may fairly be put at the same rate as that charged for railways in New South Wales, namely, £12,000 per mile : this has been the cost of the South-West lino, and it will, in this case, include the cost of the rolling stock required to work the amount of traffic taken as the standard. The comparison, therefore, between the capital expended per mile upon the different kinds of roads, and the annual charge on account of interest will be as fol lows :— Cost per mile. Interest. £ s. d. £ s. d. Macadamized road . . . 750 0 0 37 10 0 Railroad for animal power . 2,627 0 0 131 7 0 Railroad for steam power 12,000 0 0 600 0 069 The next matter for consideration will be the cost of maintenance of way; that is, the annual outlay required to maintain the road in a state of thorough repair. This must, of course, so far as the macadamized road is concerned, depend upon the amount of traffic, while the quality of the materials employed will have some action upon the annual charge. A fair approximation, however, may be arrived at by a reference to the amount commonly allowed for maintenance upon the great trunk lines of road in this Presidency, and 300 rupees, or £30 per mile, would be con sidered sufficient for a road upon which the standard amount of traffic is conveyed. The cost of repairs upon a road over which 1,872 vehicles pass per day, has, in an average of five years, amounted to £119 14s. 9d. In order to be on the safe side, therefore, I propose to allow £55 per mile for the maintenance of the macadamized line of road in thorough repair. On the road for animal power, an allowance must be made for the wear and tear of rails and sleepers. The actual wear of the road itself will be very much less of course than that of the macadamized road: for the iron rail takes the action of the wheel; if, then, the rails and sleepers are re newed in twenty years, one-twentieth of the whole cost may be provided as an annual charge; and as this cost is £1,700, one-twentieth of that sum will be £85. One-half of the ordinary sum of £30 will be sufficient to cover the cost of other repairs; so that 85 -f- 15 = £100 will cover the cost of the maintenance of the Railway for animal power. The maintenance of way upon the Railway for steam power must necessarily include an allowance for the renewal of rails, chairs, etc., and by taking the duration of these at twenty years, as in the Railway for animal power, an advan tage will be given to the locomotive line; as the action of the heavy engine, going at the rate of from 20 to 30 miles per hour, must wear away the rail much more rapidly than70 the light and slow action of the animal power. Assuming, then, 5 per cent, to be the annual deterioration of the rail and sleepers,, and the cost, as on the Madras line, to be £3,000 per mile, the annual charge for renewal of rails and chairs will be £150. The other items under the head of maintenance are grouped together in the returns, and the cost may be put on an average at £100 per annum per mile, while the charge for superintendence may be put at £5. The coat of mainte- nance of way on the steam power line will therefore be as follows :— £ «. d. Renewal of Rails and Sleepers . . . 150 0 0 Labour, Ballast, etc 100 0 0 Superintendence 5 0 0 £255 0 0 The annual charge upon the three descriptions of road under the head of interest of capital, and maintenance of way, will be as shown in the accompanying table. Macadamized Road. Eailroad, animal power. Railroad, steam power. £ 8. d. £. #. d. £ s. d.

To do this,71 however, would involve the solution of a variety of very com plicated questions. It will be far more simple, therefore, to show, for the ordinary roads and for the existing railroad, the actual charge for the conveyance of passengers and goods. In the case of the Railway, the returns show the actual charge for locomotive power under several different heads; while on the macadamized road, the contract price per passenger or per ton of goods includes not only the charge for power, but a variety of other items to which I shall allude hereafter. With reference to the Railway for animal power, I pro pose to submit a detailed estimate, on a liberal scale, of the cost of working it, as, in this country, I cannot obtain any direct information to guide me. The cost of conveying goods upon the ordinary roads has been shown to be 2&gt;\d. per ton per mile. This sum includes the interest upon the first cost of the vehicle and the cattle; the maintenance in repair of the vehicle ; the maintenance of the cattle, and the hire of the persons employed to drive them; it will also include a premium of insurance upon the car riages and cattle, so that they may be replaced in case of destruction or death by accident or disease. It also includes or should include some premium of assurance against the risk incurred as a carrier, and who is responsible for the goods under his charge. In addition to all these, it must include such a fair amount of profit as the Contractor has a right to expect, besides the simple interest on his capital. The charge for conveying 1st class passengers may be put at 6cZ. per mile. This is arrived at by taking the cost of con veyance, by the Transit Company, from Tripatore to Banga lore, a distance of 80 miles; the transit is capable of accom modating two persons inside, and a servant on the box by the driver. Each person may take 401bs. of baggage, and the total charge by the Company is 40 Rupees, or 80 Shillings, that is one shilling per mile, or sixpence for each passenger.72 A class of passengers analogous to tbe third class on the Railway is conveyed to and from places in the vicinity of Madras, at a reasonably rapid rate, in vehicles drawn by bullocks or ponies; each of these vehicles is capable of con taining four people, and the rate of charge varies from 2^. to 3(1 per mile for the whole vehicle; taking the largest sum, the cost per mile for each passenger would be Id.-, but it would be safer to estimate the average cost at Id. per mile per passenger, and this may be taken as a fair charge for such work in any part of the Presidency; as the Madras prices are probably in excess of those of the country districts. The cost then of conveying 3,220 first class and 152,000 second passengers and 32,000 tons of goods will be as follows; £ s. d. 3,220 at 6J. = 80 10 0 152,000 at Id. = 633 6 0 32,000 at 3|^. = 600 0 0 Total £1,313 16 0 The returns for the North-West Railway, for the same amount of traffic, exhibit the expenditure under the various heads of classification, as shown in the following table:— Locomotive Department Fuel Coaching Tickets .... Repair of vehicles Electric Telegraph General charges . Total £ 8. 1,906 5 3,054 12 1,259 12 116 11 117 d. 2i 0 01 4^ 51 0 6 . £6,476 18 6f This sum, divided by 41*25, the length of the line, will give 157. 0s. 3|cZ. as the cost of conveying the whole of this traffic over one mile of Railway. No attempt is made to distinguish the actual cost of conveying the different classes73 of passengers or of goods; in fact, any attempt of the kind would merely be a matter of guesswork. The above may be taken as facts, which do not involve any calculation. I have now, however, to form an estimate of the cost of conveying the same quantity of goods, and the same number of passengers, along a railway by means of animal power. The number of first-class passengers has been put at 3,220, or, roughly, 10 per day, l^r 5 each way. To convey these, one first-class carriage would be required, which would travel at the rate of ten miles per hour. It would be drawn by two horses, and would be capable of accommodating 16 passengers. The distance of 41'25 miles would be divided into five stages, each pair of horses going a stage out and a stage back, or about 16 miles per day, a spare carriage would be required and a spare pair of horses. The capital expended would be— £ £ s. d. 3 Carriages . . at 250= 750 0 0 12 Horses . . . at 45= 540 0 0 10 Sets Harness .at 10= 100 0 0 Total . . . £1,390 0 0 152,000 second-class passengers divided by 365, will give 416 as the daily number conveyed both ways. It will, how ever, be necessary to reckon upon some extra pressure occa sionally ; and carriage accommodation must be provided for, say, 240 each way, or 480 altogether. Each carriage will contain 30 passengers, and will be drawn by two horses at the rate of about 6 miles per hour; travelling the same dis tance as the horses drawing the first-class carriages. The total number of carriages and horses required for the actual work will, therefore, be 16 carriages, and 80 horses; bat it may be as well to estimate for 20 carriages and 100 horses.74 The capital expended^ then, upon rolling stock and ani- mal power will be— £ £ s. d. 20 Carriages . . at 250 = 5,000 0 0 100 Horses . . .at 40 = 4,000 0 0 16 Sets Harness .at 10= 160 0 0 Total . . £9,160 0 0 82,000 tons of goods may be put at 100 tons per day, or 60 tons each way. Three tons may be allowed for each truck, and 34, there fore, would be required; each would be drawn by three bul locks, 6 extra trucks might be allowed to meet casualties; and a few extra bullocks should be purchased. As the daily journey of a bullock may be put at ten miles, the distance of 41-25 would be divided into four stages; so that 12 bullocks would be required for each truck, 40 x 12=480 would be in daily use, or say 500 to cover contingencies. The trucks ought not to cost more than £100 each, and the bullocks £15 the pair. i ho capital, therefore, expended upon the rolling stock and animal power for the goods traffic will be— &amp; s. d. £ s. d. 40 Carriages at .... 100 0 0 = 4,000 0 0 500 Bullocks at ... . 7 io 0 = 3,250 0 0 Total . .£7,250 0 0 The total amount of dead and live stock required for the conveyance of passengers and goods along a Railway worked by animal power would be as follows :— £ s. d. 1st class passengers 1^390 0 0 2nd class „ 9,160 0 0 Good s 7,250 0 0 Total . .£17,800 0 0 Say £18,000.The above relation between the total charge upon each description of road approximates closely to that which was shown to exist in Australia under circumstances widely differ ing from those which obtain in India, though there is a marked difference in the items which make up this total. I have, in calculating the cost of working the animal power Railway, made allowances for a variety of extra expenses; and I feel confident that the sum shown in the above table will be ample to cover the whole cost of working the line, and of paying an interest of 5 per cent, upon the capital expended. Under these circumstances, it is evident that, until upon any given line of road the amount of traffic very far exceeds that which passed over the North-West line of railroad in the first half of 1863, it will be far cheaper to employ animal power than steam in the movement of passengers and goods. It remains to be seen what charge it will be necessary to impose upon the traffic, in order to cover the whole of the charges upon the road; namely, interest of capital, mainte nance of way, and cost of transport. An analysis of the cost of conveying the different descriptions of traffic will show that the following is pretty nearly the ratio of the outlay upon each First-class passenger *066 Second-class do. *430 Goods *504 and if the whole charge of £534 per mile be divided in these proportions between the different heads of traffic, the charge upon the first-class passenger must be such as would return £35 4s. 10^t?., that upon the second-class, such as would yield £229 12s. 4|(i., and that upon goods such as would give £269 2s. 8|c?. Now the charge of £35 4s. I0\d. divided by the number of first-class passengers, viz. 3,220, would give 2*6 pence as the charge per head per mile. In the same way, £229 12s. 4j(i. divided by 152,000, the number of second-class passengers, would give 1*38 farthings, as the exact charge per head per mile; while £269 '2s. 8|i.77 divided by 32,000 would give 2-018 pence as the charge per ton per mile. A first-class passenger, however, might very fairly be charged at the rate of 3 pence per mile, and a second-class at a halfpenny, while the charge for goods might be put at 1 \d. per ton per mile; at these rates, with the standard amount of traffic, the gross returns would be £556 18s. 4cZ., or £22 18s. in excess of the amount shown above to be sufficient to cover the interest of capital, maintenance of way, and cost of conveyance. Provision, however, has been made for the conveyance of upwards of 11,000 first-class pas sengers, 190,000 second-class, and 44,000 tons of goods with out any extra charge ; and should the traffic increase to this extent, the returns at the rates mentioned above would be. And the profit upon the capital expended, which, at the rate of £2,627 per mile of road for construction, and £18,000-=-41 *25 or £436 for live and dead stock, would amount to £3,063, would not be less than 13 per cent. The fair conclusion to be drawn from what has been stated is, that, with an amount of traffic larger than that which is likely to pass over most of the feeders of the Railways now in progress, a Railway worked by animal power would be a much cheaper mode of communication than either a macada mized road or a Railway worked by steam power. If, however, this would be the case when the traffic is already heavy upon the line of road, the advantages of animal power over steam would be still more marked when the traffic is comparatively light, and requires to be developed gradually. A Railway worked by steam must be provided with engines of power sufficient to drag the largest train over the steepest gradient on the line: and though the consumption of fuel is £ s. d. 1st class passengers . . 137 10 0 . . 395 16 8 . . 275 0 0 2nd Do. Goods . . Total £808 6 8&gt; r r 78 to a certain extent proportioned to the load the engine has to convey, yet, as this load is in very great measure com- posed of the dead or unprofitable weight of engines and car riages, the saving of fuel is not very great; while the other items which make up the working expenses, are in great measure independent of the load, and form a mileage charge. With a Railway worked by anim 1 power the case is dif- ferent; here the power required is strictly in proportion to the load ; no more horses or bullocks are kept than will be sufficient to meet the demands of the public for conveyance; and if these demands are casual or intermittent, arrangements can easily be made to meet the casual portion of the demand without the expenditure of capital, or the imposition of a permanent charge upon the promoters of the line of Railway. Again, the power of a locomotive engine must be proportioned to the maximum effort it has to make; that is, it must be competent to overcome the steepest gradient in the line with a full train behind it; it must, therefore, have an amount of power more than sufficient to do the work of the more level portions of the line ; in fact, it is necessary to have an engine of 100 horse power, which it might have to exert for a mile Or two; while an engine of 50 horse power would be amply sufficient to do the remainder of the work. This is not the case with a Railway worked by animal power; if there be a hill too steep to be surmounted by a carriage drawn by the ordinary team of hoi ss or bullocks, the simple plan is to have a spare pair at the )ttom to help the carriages over the hill. This, however, wL seldom be necessary with horse teams; for a horse has a 'eserve of muscular energy, which enables him to exercise, fo. a short time, a much greater amount of power than is wanted for his ordinary work. It is not, of course, probable, that the ratio between the passengers and goods traffic, which I have assumed as the standard for calculation, will obtain upon ordinary branch■■■■MflHtomamMnaMnn 1 ■■■■■■■■ 78 ■tioned to is ifl, Stable we is not very i 6 working le ^ Vanini! power ttj, iquiredisst or 'Dtait'r asualorintermite,^ of capital, or tie bs ie promoters of dieL lotive engine miis^ has to make; 'ii . ) steepest gradient sii: aust, therefore, kit. ttodotleworbfr: it, it is necessarjteiiii i it might bi to®!' )f 50 horse power k ,der of the work, rith a Mwajiorls too steep to be®- inary team of ^ ■ a spare p&amp;ir ?

The passengers traffic will be less than the standard, while the goods traffic will exceed it j looking, however, to this fact that I have estimated the cost of the rolling stock and the animal power at a high figure^ and have been very easy in my demands upon the animal power, it is more than probable that, when worked by a Company or an individual, the charge of \\d. per ton per mile will be found sufficient to cover all expenses, and to give an interest upon the capital expended of at least 5 per cent. I think, then, that I am justified in applying to by far the larger number of branches from the main lines of Rail way in India the following conclusions, which are very nearly identical with those which are expressed, in the second section of this paper, with reference to Australian Railways. 1st. That the cost of transport upon a macadamized road is largely in excess of that upon a railroad, whether such railroad be worked by animal or steam power. 2nd. That the actual cost of steam power is much less than that of animal power upon railroads, but that this cheapness is, with a limited amount of traffic, more than compensated for by the increased cost of construction and maintenance of the railroad worked by steam. 3rd. That the circumstances of the country are not such as to admit of so large a development of traffic upon the branch lines of railroad as would compensate, by the saving in the cost of motive power, for the increased charge under the heads of interest of capital and maintenance of way, consequent upon the adaptation of the road for steam power. 4th. That, as a general rule, it would be far cheaper, and, therefore, more advantageous in every respect, to construct the branch lines of Railway with a view to their being worked by animal power. W. T.

I n any country whero mules and camels are the only means Argument more of transport, and owing to whose mountainous nature level rib^toVmkey, roads are impossible, carriage-roads will never prove a finan cial success; for on inclinations greater than 5 per cent, a mule can carry more than he can pull; and as a good road Mules v. wheel- is to him a matter of the greatest indifference, the shorter break-neck route will always have the preference, more especially if by so doing the toll of the carriage-road (how ever moderate) can be avoided. There being no wheel- ^ w ^ ee '' carriages in existence in Syria, it is not probable that under camage3 eX!Sr such unfavourable conditions wheel-traffic will ever obtain a firm footing in the country. The wheel-traffic on a carriage-road in Turkey could never be considerable, owing, in the first place, to the preference given by muleteers to the shortest routes; and secondly, that the people are not at all mechanical; and therefore wheel- carriages even if introduced would soon die out, especially as, owing to the steep inchnes, transport in the old style proves to be the more economical. i. rivate enterprise is always preferable to Grovemment Private enter- undertakings ; but to induce private companies to risk their pr M ' capital in works of public utility, it must be proved to them, firstly, that sufficient traffic exists; secondly, that by means of a lower tariff the company can be absolutely certain of the monopoly; thirdly, that the inclines are not so steep, that all possible profit would be eaten up by the wear and tear of horseflesh, material, &amp;c.; and, fourthly, that the proposed b 2No chance for road-making in Turkey, Railways. Narrow gauge. ( 4 ) route shall not be much more circuitous than the existing O tracks (an absolute impossibility in a mountainous country). If all these conditions are not fulfilled mules will always have the advantage, and consequently little or no traffic could be depended upon-for yielding a revenue. Mules are truly formidable opponents; they eat but little and work well, never seem to die or wear out, and steep or level roads are all one to them. Their traction powers are, however, inferior to the horse. In the majority of cases none of these conditions can be guaranteed; therefore, thus either privately or publicly, roads are not likely to be extensively constructed. I am also decidedly of opinion that, so far as the Govern ment is concerned, the construction of carriage-roads under such circumstances is of no &gt; public utility, as no one can or will use them. Therefore such enterprises in a country like this is simply money wasted. What then is to be done ? Railways would certainly absorb all the traffic, by reason of the great gain in time, convenience to passengers, &amp;c.; but owing to their enormous first cost they would never pay a dividend, or even realize sufficient profit to relieve the Govern ment of the guarantee incubus, which is already stifling railway progress in Turkey. The first lines constructed have taken far too much money, consequently the funds necessary for further works are not forthcoming. Had the sums already paid by the Ottoman Government for guarantees been expended instead on economical railways, we should now be enjoying a considerable network of rail ways in Turkey; the Government would also have been free from all liability on this head, and in a position to extend their operations. Very narrow gauge railways are not scientific; their sta bility is insecure, and in countries where land costs nothing the economy is very trifling. An economical railway, work-( 5 ) able either by animal power for branches, or by steam power for the main line, is what is required. Mr. Haddan's railway consists of a wall about one yard Haddan 's rail- high on the average, and about one foot thick, on the top of Description, which a single longitudinal rail and sleeper is to be laid. This wall is continuous, and may be considered in the light of a deep rail. Earthworks are in the majority of cases avoided, as the Earthworks wall varies in height according to the minor undulations of avoidod * the ground. No hedges or ditches will be necessary, for the rail being No ditches or a yard above the surface of the ground, obstructions need not be feared. The culverts and small bridges consist merely of apertures in the wall. Bridges of large span may consist of a single iron girder, Bridges very with a wooden staging suspended some 7 or 8 feet under- eLU11 ' Jlulcal - neath, for the use of foot-passengers. Or if built of stone would consist of but a thin slice, so to speak, of a bridge of the usual form, the width at top not exceeding a foot. Timber or iron rafters, about 12 feet long, would be built in the masonry at right angles, so as to project on either side and carry stagings for foot-passengers, one on either side of the (main line) wall, giving a transverse section in the form of a cross ; where, owing to the inequalities of the ground, the wall exceeds 1J yard in height, the wall is to be con structed thicker, and counterforts of earth or stone are to be Counterforts, used in support. Boulders (which are plentiful) placed either side of the wall, and well packed with smaller stones, will answer the purpose perfectly, and at the same time cost but little. The rolling stock consists of double carriages arranged in Rolling stock, pairs, one on either side of the wall, and connected together Caiua S' b - at the top only by a roof common to both, leaving a free( 6 ) Horizontal friction-wheels Wall con struction. Suitable for common roads. Sharp curves. Vertical wheels, Axle-boxes. Equilibrium, Locomotive longitudinal passage about 15 inches wide between the two. In the upper part of this passage the vertical wheels are arranged one behind the other in Indian file; the lower half is however left entirely open and free, so that when the wagon is mounted astride the wall its two halves will hang down on either side of the wall like the legs of a man on horseback. The under-side of each carriage is provided with horizontal friction-wheels furnished with springs, which preserve the balance by pressing against the wall on either side, near its base. Only those portions of the wall where these horizontal wheels work against it need be dressed and plastered to an even surface. The rest simply hammer dressed. (See a, a, Figs. 1 and 3.) The carriages may be fitted on either side with vertical wheels to suit any gauge, or may be arranged for running on an ordinary road if required. By a simple self-acting arrangement the wheels are made to radiate, so that very sharp curves can be traversed without inconvenience. The vertical wheels are partly visible above the roof, an arrangement which permits the use of larger wheels, and renders the axle-boxes more accessible. As in practice the load will never be quite equally balanced (though to secure an approximate equilibrium it should be attempted), one of these friction-wheels, by always bearing against its own side of the wall, will effectually prevent all probability or possibility of oscillation. Example. —Greater steadiness is experienced on the curves than on the straights of an ordinary railway. W hen the speed is considerable, the horizontal wheels will not touch the w T all at all— ex. Bicycle. The locomotive will consist of a pair of vertical boilers, one( 7 ) on either side of the wall. The horizontal wheels in this Fell's system, case will, on the Fell-Yignoles system, grip the wall between them with any amount of force desired, and thus overcome gradients even steeper than the Mont Cenis; being free, how ever, from the frightful jolts which are there experienced. The brake will be on the same system. These horizontal Brake, driving wheels may be furnished with india-rubber or leather tyres, so as not to injure the cement-bearing surface, while the bite or purchase would be also thereby greatly increased. (See Fig. 4.) On steep inclines the wall will not be plastered, the bare Steep inclines, stone giving more adhesion. Thus I provide a roughened rail (of cement) for the hori zontal driving wheels to work against, and a smooth iron rail for the vertical wheels (which carry all the weight) to run on—an advantage possessed by no other system. The wagons to carry 2 tons. The carriages to accommodate eight persons, back to back, Accommo- and facing outwards. A speed of 25 miles an hour will be the economical maxi- Speed, mum on a wall composed of brick or stone. If greater speeds are required, the main wall should be constructed of concrete, so as not to be affected by vibration. Overhead travelling cranes to be used in the termini for Arranging shifting the carriages and composing the trains; or a modi- tiains ' fication of the traverser will be made use of. Points will consist of a segmental turntable furnished with Sidings, one deep rail (the depth of the wall), which can be turned to any desired angle. We only propose them, however, for single lines, and on principle avoid them as much as possible, as in semi-civilized countries the care requisite for managing them cannot be depended upon. Kocky soil, by affording a good foundation for the wall, is the most desirable. In ordi nary railways the reverse is the case. Where stone is scarce or the laud marshy, a wooden or ironn? 1 Alternative wooden viaduct. Iron viaduct. Arab masonry. Snow. Durability. Existing roads. Cost. ( 8 ) viaduct, composed of a single line of columns, will take the place of the wall. (See Figs. 2 and 7.) Shallow rivers will be passed in the same manner. If both stone and timber are scarce, a deep rail or girder of iron, supported on transverse pot sleepers, would be made use of, at a cost not exceeding 750/. a mile. For Syria the Arab system of masonry is adopted. The wall consists of two shallow faces, the intervening space being filled in with concrete. In countries where heavy falls of snow are experienced, the remedy consists in making the wall or viaduct proportionately higher. All these materials are very durable and stable, and not liable to be destroyed, like earthworks, by tropical rains, &amp;c. On existing mountain roads the wall should be placed about 3 feet from the unprotected side; it would thus answer also as a parapet for the carriage-road. The cost of railways has varied between 150,000/. and 3000/. a mile. This system for a single line can be executed at from 500/. to 1000/. per mile, according to the nature of the country. It is even possible, for postal and very light traffic, to arrange a line suitable for carriages of four passengers,* and for wagons to hold three-quarters of a ton, at a cost of only 300/. a mile. Three or four trains a day would, even on this diminutiye scale, amply accommodate the principal towns of Syria. The portion being constructed in Aleppo is of this calibre. The branch traffic of the Euphrates Valley Kailway might be very economically worked on this principle. An ordinary railway, with its gigantic rolling stock, would never pay; its carriages and wagons would be always nearly empty. 511 In this case the four passengers sit as in an ordinary road -carriage, viz. two with their backs to the engine, the other two facing them. The wall, however, divides the carriage longitudinally, so that only two pas sengers remain in each compartment, their sides to the wall.( 9 ) Light but frequent trains must in every sense prove more economical and convenient, as the works would be less costly in the first instance, being constructed to carry but a very moderate weight. To increase the accommodation, more frequent trains, and not larger rolling stock and more expensive works, would be resorted to. The reasons why our railways have always been constructed Horizontal on such a mammoth scale is the fact that as the traction power wheels. of a locomotive depends upon its weight, a broad gauge and very heavy machines are a sine qua non. This reason, how ever, no longer holds good with a locomotive provided with horizontal instead of vertical driving wheels; and therefore the old groove need be no longer followed. Europe has spoilt European engineers for railway con- Turkey, struction in Turkey; it wants four or five years' residence in the country to thoroughly eradicate European notions, which, for the most part, are unsuited to a comparatively uncivilized country like Turkey. For Turkey, our system is feasible and easy of execution; masons are plentiful, and the style of work very simple. Carriage-roads which exist in Turkey are of too steep a nature, and the curves far too abrupt, to ever hope that they can be laid with rails. Inclines of 1 in 7, and curves 50 yards radius, are of frequent occurrence. Our system, however, even in such extreme cases, is avail able.( ) SUMMAEY OF ADVANTAGES PECULIAB TO THIS SYSTEM. But one rail is employed. All the weight being helow the rail, great stability is assured. Running off the line is an absolute impossibility. In cultivated countries very admissible, as but little ground is taken. The wall acting as a middle rail of exrteme rigidity, Fell's system can be used under the most favourable conditions; and inclines hitherto but dreamed of can be easily surmounted. The locomotive, though very light, possesses enormous adhe sion ; for the horizontal wheels can be screwed together with any desired force, and the requisite bite obtained, totally irrespective of the weight of the locomotive. In the majority of cases no earthworks will be required, as the height ol the wall varies with the undulations of the country, and by means of sharp curves of 50 yards radius all bad spots are easily left aside—a great economy in rocky countries, where cuttings are ruinously expensive and earth is wanting for embankments. The cost of bridges is reduced to a minimum. The wall as it progresses is available for the transport of mate rials, even before the rail is laid. The system possesses great rapidity of execution, months instead of years. Materials very durable, therefore expense of maintenance would be trifling. No ditches or fences requisite, as the rail being in the air no obstructions need be feared. Culverts would merely consist of apertures in the wall.10 ) ( 11 ) Stages PEC^- &gt; SYSTEM, Wnteimpoilifc, 7 admissitle.ititfe, nil of entemerafcii i fayoniable witii: i »e easily gnmoital ery light, ymm ^ canbesereidtok e bite obtsmcd, - oeartliworbFi bl ithe nndikuciofif in rocky cosnti^ liswantiiigfeffl^ ^ to ami®®' fl aYaikblefflrtiie* : ' lid. The system is available for use either with animal or steam power. Where great economy is stringent, even the rails may be dis pensed with, a smooth plaster concave surface being substituted. (See Fig. 9.) Walls of concrete would be very economical. Brickwork is also available. This system is the narrowest gauge possible—viz. one rail. Distinctly advantageous for existing mountain roads. In forests, the wooden viaduct should be constructed as much as possible 'on the natural trees, cut off short, being stronger than piles. Collisions are impossible on a double line, no points being used: the carriages to be lifted clean off one line and deposited on the other by the overhead travelling cranes , thus no carriage or wagon could possibly get on the main line even by the grossest careless ness. Common roads afford great facilities to an invading force, but railways on this system without the rolling stock would be of no use to anyone; besides which, it can so easily be destroyed if necessary.

Sir, As an old member of the Euphrates Expedition, I have endeavoured to discuss in a fair and impartial spirit the bearing of the evidence laid before the Select Committee of the House of Commons last session upon the Euphrates Valley Railway. It is especially gratify ing to see, that so far as it has gone, the great prepon derance of evidence given before the Committee, has been in favour of the views you have so long and so persistently advocated. And in testimony of the ad miration I entertain for the unflagging energy and unwearied assiduity you have displayed, for a long series of years, in advocating the importance of Railway communication with India, as essential to the main tenance of the power and stability of the British Empire in the East, I beg that you will accept the dedication of the following pages. L ondon, March 12(k, 1872. THE AUTHORTHE EUPHRATES YALLEY RAILWAY.* There it flows—one of the great rivers of the world hourly, daily, monthly pouring its deep waters along what was once the most fertile and populous centre ot the human race, every inch of which is capable of being reclaimed-—to wash the walls of a few sleeping towns and villages, to benefit half-civilised Arabs with their camels, buffaloes, and sheep, or to irrigate long lines of date-trees—and nothing is made of it. Thirty-six years ago an expedition was sent out by an enlightened monarch and a liberal government— liberal in its true sense—to survey this great stream, for the purpose of opening a short, easy, and accessible route to India. The work was performed, the maps and sections are there, but nothing has as yet come of it. a company was formed under the auspices of ,, * Import from the Select Committee on Euphrates Valley Railway; toere- tlier with the Proceedings of the Committee, Minutes of Evidence, Appendix, ana Index. Ordered by the House of Commons to be printed July 27, 1871.Mr. W. P. Andrew, a gentleman deeply interested in opening railway communication with, and in, India, but government, whilst subsidising or guaranteeing Indian railways and steam-boat communication, declined to do the same in aid of the link which is necessary to establish the connexion of the two countries. It is not surprising that, although no one has been able to bring any serious or irrefutable arguments against the Euphrates Valley route, or as yet to suggest a better or a more natural one, although general opinion has been in its favour, and it is perfectly known to all conversant with the subject that such a line would not only facilitate communication with our Indian pos sessions, and thereby give a vast impetus to commerce with the East generally, but that it would also, whilst strengthening our tenure, be in reality the foundation of a new empire, still capitalists and investors should decline to undertake that which from its magnitude (unless, as has been suggested by some, it was carried out by segments at a time), must necessarily occupy some years in its completion, and in the interval afford no interest for the money invested, or traffic returns could be made available as dividends. Happily, however, government has, after this long lapse of time, been once more aroused to a sense of the great importance of the Euphrates Valley Railway to the commerce of this country and the security of our empire; and a committee of the House of Commons has been sitting to take evidence upon the subject, and will, it is to be hoped, prolong its labours this session, upon a motion to that effect originally made by Sir• 1 1 Nation witli. ^idisingor^ '^atcommiiiiidj^ 116 ^wticUq;: Ae two comtrifi [ 1 110 one b ^ utable: ? ss yet to siigc Ithougli general jp: it is perfdj fe ttkt suchlksr, ition witl our k a vast impetus^ at that itwoijli be in realtjiel itelists and iii« : whid froiK : isted by some, ,e), must nee®'' n, and in tic * j invested, or islb dividends. •nment h ^ 5 ' ? ire i upbrates vw' of tlie ig its jet origin#^ George S. Jenkinson. It would appear that the honour able member's attention was first called to the subject by his excellency the Turkish ambassador, Musurus Pasha. Sir George Jenkinson discussed the matter with the Turkish ambassador, and came to the conclu sion that the work would be most easily carried out by a joint guarantee on the part of the British and Turkish governments. He also sought for information from documents and persons acquainted with the sub ject, such as General Chesney and others, who have devoted much time and attention to the inquiry, and the general conclusion he arrived at was, as stated in his own words before the committee, that the Euphrates Valley route is the shortest route, the most direct route, and the most feasible, and, therefore, the cheapest; and it is, moreover, the only route which could ever be assisted, in any material degree, by either this country or the Turkish government. Therefore, looking at it altogether, he thought that practically it is the only line which is attainable at present. The first public meeting of the select committee was held on the 17th of July, when Sir Henry Rawlinson and General Chesney were severally examined. The first-mentioned gentleman, so well-known for his inti mate acquaintance with Oriental geography and litera ture, gave his evidence mainly in connexion with the various routes that have been suggested or proposed between the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Persian Gulf. The first of these proposed routes, and for which a concession was offered by the Turkish government so long ago as 1866 or 1867, was to con- ———-nect Constantinople with the Persian Gulf, starting from Scutari, and passing by Ismid (Mcomedia), Kutaiyah, Kara-hissar, Kunieh,or Koniyeh (Iconium), andKaiserieh, or Kaisariyeh (Caesareia), to Aleppo, and then down the valley of the Euphrates to Baghdad and Bussorah, and from Bussorah to the Persian Gulf. The distance was estimated at seventeen hundred miles, including a branch from Aleppo to Alexandretta. The difficulties presented by the very peculiar physical aspect of Asia Minor, in the early portion of this proposed line, were discussed in reference to analogous suggestions made previous to the one here alluded to, by Mr. Campbell, Mr. Wright (' Christianity and Commerce, the Natural Results of the Geograpical Progression of Railways,' 1S49), Dr. Thompson, and Sir R. M. Stephenson, in a pamphlet published in 1856 by Stanford of Charing Cross, entitled, ' r l he Euphrates Valley Route to India, by a Iraveller. These difficulties are not insuperable. Nothing, indeed, can be positively stated as insuperable to modern science, backed by a sufficiency of time and capital. But it is essential in such discussions to keep in view whether the amount of time and capital neces sary to carry out any particular scheme would not put all question of a possible remuneration out of the field. Any person minutely acquainted with the great central plateau ot Asia Minor and its various outlets, whether to the south, through the Taurus, or down to the shores of the Black Sea or the Mediterranean, must be con vinced that the approach to that central plateau from ( onstantinople, which is most feasible and most likely to be remunerative, would be by the high road to the pass fek tbTjWUji. ■ ik 9 of Hajji Hamsah on the Halys, and up the open valley of that river to Sivas or Sebaste. The deviation of the route as presented by Sir Henry Rawlinson to the committee, from Iconium to Caesareia, instead of its being prolonged directly by the Gates of Cilicia, is objectionable. A practical knowledge of the country attests that there is no feasible line of approach for a railway from Caesareia to Syria, through Taurus, but that the line would have to return to the said Gates of Cilicia, now known as the Kulak Boghaz. This pass presents some difficulties, especially at one point; but the only ther passes available through Taurus, that by Marash (Germanicia), that from Malatiya to Besni, and that to Dyarbekir, present still greater. Perhaps Sir Henry Rawlinson meant a branch line from Iconium to Caesareia, which would be a very easy matter. It is difficult to reply in detail in a viva voce examination. In other respects the proposed line, by having a branch from Aleppo to the bay of Alexandretta, or to the bay of Antioch, would be the complement of the proposed Euphrates Valley Railway. ' Mr. Skene, consul at Aleppo, who knows the country perhaps better than most travellers,' reports Mr. W. J. Maxwell, in Appendix No. 4, 'said to me, and I have his authority for giving his opinion pub licly, that 'any through line of railway between Con stantinople and Baghdad must pass through Alex andretta or Aleppo; and if through Alexandretta, would follow the present post-road, passing through the range of the Taurus, by Gulegh (Kulak), Boghaz10 Pass, west of Adanah, where the great interior table land would be reached. This is probably four thousand feet over the sea.' (Our observations made the uplands at this point about three thousand feet above the level of the sea.) 'It is broken up by great mountain ranges.' 1 ' Mr. Skene was also of opinion that 'no great difficulty would be met after the Taurus Pass until Iconium would be reached. It would be difficult to Kutiah (Kutaiyah), and still more difficult from Kutiah to Ismid, or from Kutiah to Aideen.' As to any line by Dyarbekir, he does not believe it practicable. A next route noticed by Sir Henry Rawlinson was one proposed by Colonel Herbert, the present political agent in Turkish Arabia. It would leave the Medi terranean at Alexandretta, pass by Aleppo, across the Euphrates at Bir to Urfah (Edessa), and so on to Dyar bekir, turning back by Nisibin to Mosul, and thence following the valley of the Tigris to Baghdad and Bussorah, This route is described as being, perhaps, one hundred or one hundred and twenty miles, or perhaps one hundred and fifty miles longer than the line down the Euphrates Valley, as it makes a considerable detour to the north-east, but it has the advantage of passing through a number of large cities and centres of trade, and lying generally amid settled and populous districts. The distances here given are underrated. Admitting the distance from Aleppo to Bir, or Birijik, to be about the same as a given point at which the Euphrates Rail way would strike the river, still the distance between the two points (about seventy miles), would be all gain to the latter route. Then again it is at least one hundred11 and twenty -five miles from Bir to Dyarbekir by Urfah, and it is over two hundred miles from Dyarbekir to Mosul, where a point on the Tigris would be reached, parallel to that attained by a journey of merely some fifty or sixty miles from Aleppo to the Euphrates. To this must be added the still more serious objection that the northern part of the plain of Mesopotamia, between Urfah and Dyarbekir, is either hilly and rocky, or covered with an overflow of rugged basalt, cut through by narrow but deep rivers. Dyarbekir stands in a hilly region, and upon a knoll of the same character. From below Mardin, which has been called the Quito of Mesopotamia, the country is, however, admirably adapted for a railway. As to ' large cities and centres of trade,' there are only Urfah, Dyarbekir, and Mosul. Bir is a mere town and passage place, Mardin a town, and Nisibin a ruin, that would, however, come to life again. Arbil, Koi Sanjak, and Kirkuk lie to the east of the valley of the Tigris, at the foot of the Kurdistan Mountains; and while the trade of Dyarbekir and Mosul would flow to Aleppo, as it does now, or to the Euphrates Valley Railway, the trade of the latter places and of regions further east, would flow to Baghdad, also a proposed station on the Euphrates line. 1 here is, then, commercially speaking, little advantage to be gained by the line of the river Tigris, whilst a much greater distance would have to be traversed, and an almost incalculable increase of expenditure would have to be incurred, and that at the same time that the com paratively more settled character of the country could not be made for a moment to weigh against the serious12 and fatal objections which lie in the wa}' of such a project being carried out.* A further alternative was noticed by Sir Henry Raw- linson as suggested by a Mr. Childs. This was to leave the Black Sea at Tereboli, near Trebizond ; to cross the mountains to the valley of the Euphrates at Erzingan, where it was to take a steamer and to pass down the Euphrates to the point nearest to Dyarbekir, whence the transit was to follow the Tigris down to the sea by steamer. Sir Henry Rawlinson himself admits as ob jections to the proposed line, that it is only for two or' tlnee months in the year that it is possible to navigate either the Euphrates from Erzingan, or the Tigris from Dyarbekir, and ' if a steamer did go down the rivers, it certainly would never come up again.' This project iuither involves first a railway across the mountains fiom Tereboli to Erzingan, and when what is embraced in that brief expression of 'across the mountains' is i- i^r/' ^ orf ; testimony (Ausw. 777) to the inadvisability of the line by iJjarbekir, as well as Mr. Ainswortli (Answ. 303). Mr. Lynch said such a line would be practicable, but he added : ' Dyarbekir is off my main line, and it could be as easily connected afterwards, and there is nothing to be o anu going to Dyarbekir, and the country is tnountainous. Dyarbekir is a sma 1 p ace ; there are only about five thousand inhabitants. By goine by the Euphrates me along all the rivers flowing into the Euphrates, a coramo- mcation could be easily made into the trunk line with Dyarbekir and Mosul.' ibat is to say, by the Khabur and its tributaries, and the Balik-su, or uS i ' ,? C * ,ent . Baslle Y s or ^yal River. The line by the Kbabnr is a -kuow n old Assyrian and Arabian commercial route, and it is far preferable wi a ;i fi n e r^pp^ed. by Mr. T. Macneil (Answ. 415), from Anah to Mosul. i e to \ alley ol the Balik-su might be used to bring the commerce of Urfah and Jdarran to the trunk line at Ilakkah on the Euphrates, the old line of the .d mi might tie used to bring the commerce of Mosul by the Mygdonius or '} mgar to Arban (Habor, Arbonai). The tributaries to the river of Gozan (.trausamtis of Ptolemy), the .Terjub, ancient Cherub, the Zirgan, and others, pom e way in a similar manner to Suwerek (Seleucia), to Dyarbekir, to Has- a - in and to Mardin. All these Mesopotamian streams unite to form the er o Ma jor, Chaboras, or Khabur, which flows into the Euphrates at , ar isiyah (anc. Circesium). The towns and stations existing in former times ong this line are all enumerated by the Arabian geographers.13 realised, the mind stands aghast. The plateau of Erzerum is from five thousand five hundred to five thousand seven hundred feet above the level of the sea. It has to be reached from the sea across a chain of mountains which attain a still greater elevation, and which rise abruptly from the littoral country a few miles from the sea. The approach by the valley of the Tereboli river to Gumush Khan eh may possibly diminish these difficulties, but the}^ must still remain very great. A second railway would have to be carried from the Euphrates to Dyarbekir, which is exposed to the same objections as Colonel Herbert's proposed route. Indeed, as Sir Henry Rawlinson himself says, u that particular part of the country being, as I believe, abso lutely impracticable for a railway.' There are other objections of detail to the scheme, such as the character of the country about Erzingan and Kapan Madan, and more especially the falls near Gergen Kalehsi (Julio- polis), where the Euphrates forces its way through Taurus; but such discussions are needless where a project is so utterly infeasible on general grounds. The now celebrated M. de Moltke explored the last-men tioned portion of the river, in view of transmitting the material of the Turkish army, before it crossed from Malatiyah into Syria by the Besni Pass, and previous to the battle of Nizib, and found it to be utterly impracticable. Sir Henry Rawlinson also made mention of another proposed route from the Black Sea, which was to start from Trebizond, to ascend over five thousand feet to Erzerum, to be prolonged thence to Van, and then14 down the Betlis-su to the Tigris, above Mosul, and along the valley of the same river. The writer has explored every one of the passes of Taurus, and except ing the pass of the Pyramus to Marash, he can con fidently assert that none offer greater difficulties than that of Betlis. Betlis itself, at an elevation of five thousand four hundred and seventy feet, is built amid perpendicular terraces of lava. The country south wards is a succession of mountainous ascents and de scents, and Macdonald Kinneir stigmatised the Derej Tusul Pass, near Kufra, as the worst he ever met with. ' This line would indeed,' Sir Henry Rawlinson remarked, ' cross the range of the Taurus in about its most difficult and impracticable portion, and I should think that it would be utterly impossible to effect it, the country being cut up by a succession of preci pitous ravines and mountain torrents and impracticable defiles.' It is to be further observed, in connexion with these almost impracticable lines from the Black Sea, that the opinions of almost all who gave evidence was opposed to them, as compared with a terminus on the Medi terranean, upon the grounds that not only would such a terminus be more exposed to interruption in case of misunderstandings arising between Russia and Turkey, but that whilst in case of necessity troops could be sent directly from England to Syria, they would have to reach a port on the Black Sea to pass by the Dardanelles and Bosphorus, the sea itself possibly in possession of an inimical fleet, or they would have to be sent across in15 Europe through several different countries, the rela tions with which might be disturbed at the very mo ment of an emergency. Sir Henry Rawlinson also briefly touched upon the important question of connecting Europe directly with India, and he noticed in connexion with such a project three possible lines; one from Constantinople by Erzerum to Teheran, Mushed, Herat, Kandahar, and the Bolan Pass; another by Angora, Sivas, Dyar- bekir, Kifri, Kermanshah, and Hamadan to Teheran ; and a third, a prolongation of the Euphrates Valley route or the Tigris route, by the sea-coast to Kurrachi. These projects are upon so extensive a scale that it is impossible to enter upon them here, even if we possessed the knowledge of the countries east of Kurdistan neces sary to do so with effect, which we do not. Sir George Jenkinson pertinently asked in connexion with these projects : ' If the difficulty the Euphrates line of eight hundred and fifty miles has always had to contend with has arisen from want of funds, and that difficulty has hitherto been found insuperable as regards a per fectly flat line, which has been surveyed, would not that difficulty apply with tenfold force to lines over mountains and through ravines, and a length of from three thousand to three thousand five hundred miles ?' Sir Henry Rawlinson's reply was noteworthy : 'It would no doubt apply to a certain extent; but a through line would involve' much larger, and higher, and more important interests, which I think might fairly be taken into consideration as against the mere difficulties of raising a larger sum of money; that is tosay, it would of be immense importance to India to be in continuous railway communication with Europe, whereas it would be of very trifling importance merely to have the territory bridged over between the Medi- terranean and the Persian Gulf by a railway, while there was still a long sea voyage, or a considerable sea voy age, on either side of the Euphrates Valley Railway.' There is much truth in this. There can be no ques tion as to the immense importance to India, and even to China, of a continuous railway communication with Europe, and such a thing will no doubt be one day brought about, unless the traffic is turned in another direction by the opening of American trans-Pacific and Atlantic lines, but in the mean time, the advantages ' o presented by the Euphrates Valley Railway are by no means so trifling as Sir Henry Rawlinson thinks. The line would in all probability be a portion of any more extended scheme that could be carried out, especially to Kurrachi; and in as far as the political interests of Great Britain are concerned, it would be more advan tageous to her to have a railway, of which she could hold the two termini, than to have a part of a long continuous line, any portion of which, European or Asiatic, might be interrupted by unforeseen complica tions. In the same sense, a prolongation on the one side to Constantinople, and on the other to Kurrachi, would be safer than a more northerly line. General Chesney* was also examined upon the dif- * sad it is to have to place on record, that in the brief interval between |he first printing and reprinting of these few pages, this gallant officer should have been removed from us for ever!

It might start from either Alex- andretta or Seleucia, but he preferred the latter. General Chesney was also in favour of a point near Bussorah as a southern terminus. In reply to other questions having reference to a Black Sea line. General Chesney advanced, from practical knowledge of the country, the same objections previously detailed, with the addi tional one, that Frebizond is only an open roadstead, and, he added, such a line would be highly advan tageous to Russia, but of little or no service whatever to this country, and the Tigris line would be a very difficult and very expensive one. When cross-ques tioned upon the point of the comparative strategic importance ot a terminus on the Mediterranean, the veteran leader of the Euphrates Expedition, after clearly and distinctly enunciating the advantages of the latter route as the most direct, the most easy, and the most lust carried out an expedition to the river Euphrates, but who died before the i leam of Ins life became a reality, will no doubt be done elsewhere. io the author, who accompanied liim in his long, arduous, ar.d perilous expe dition, his memory is, however, especially endeared by many acts of personal kindness and friendship, shown amidst trying circumstances; as also by the ii'gli regard, which he could not but feel, for the ability shown in carrying out an expedition in, at that time, little known regions, amidst all kinds of diffi culties, and for the dauntless courage with which he met, and -the perseverance and resolution with which he overcame these obstacles. It was one of General Chesnej's favourite axioms, that nothing is impossible where there is a will, and he carried out this principle with inflexible deter- niination, yet with the good feelings of a practical Christian, ever ready to make allowances for the prejudices of the half-civilised people with whom he had to deal, and with a lively and undeviating anxiety for the welfare and happiness oi tiiose who were placed under his command. B18 feasible, and as having both termini on the sea, where they would be under the entire control of Great Britain, pointedly added, 'You w^ould lose the Black Sea instantly. That is a thing to look after, and the Black Sea is half gone already.' General Chesney was also as explicit upon the commercial advantages of the Euphrates Railway as upon its advantages for the trans port of troops either to or from India. Nothing could be more clear or satisfactory than his evidence upon these subjects. He also bore strong testimony to the friendly disposition and character of the natives. The Arabs, he said, might look to some small gratuity, but they need not be subsidised. They would be willing also to labour. As to the climate, it would be better than that on the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. The Euphrates line would also have local traffic. The Suez Canal has none. Mr. Palgrave was quoted as having said that the country is sinking every day more hope less! v into poverty; nor is there any hope of ameliora tion under the existing land legislation. Turkey in Asia is certainly not an improving country, but General Chesney showed by such commercial returns as he haa at hand that the existing commerce is considerable. The general has shown the same fact in detail in his works, as has also Mr. Andrew in his u Euphrates Valley Route to India, 1 ' and in other w r orks. h urther, although the commerce of Aleppo—the most important of all in North Syria—has passed in great part from British into other hands, still wherever Europeans ha\e established themselves, as notoriously the Lynch s at Baghdad, and Mr. C. Rassam at Mosul, the local com-19 merce has undergone a prodigious impetus. Sir Charles Wingfield objected to the breaking of bulk at Seleucia and on the Persian Gulf, but this objection, as General Chesney pointed out, and as Mr. Lynch admitted, only applies to weighty and bulky merchandise, which can be conveyed at a cheaper rate even from Baghdad by the Suez Canal than it probably would be by the pro posed railway. This, however, is very conjectural, and at all events would not affect the ordinary traffic on the railway. Sir Charles Wingfield further did not think that in a sanitary and other points of view, ex cepting in very great emergencies, where the saving of a week might be of great importance, it would be worth while to send troops by a long railway journey, when in seven days more you could send them by a sea voyage. General Chesney replied to this, ' that the Euphrates Railway route is safer in a sanitary point of view than the Red Sea, and that the railway journey would only be about three days from sea to sea.' 1 The civil and military officers, for example, in India would be very glad to save the expenses entailed by seven days' loss of time in going from England to India, or vice versa. But if the speed between the two termini could be made to attain anything like that at which the service is performed between London and Edin burgh and Glasgow, it would not require more than two days and a night to travel from the Persian Gult to the Mediterranean Sea. General Chesney estimated the seven days' gain not upon the railway alone, but upon the whole line. The length of the railway would be about eight hundred and fifty miles, and there would b 220 not be more than five hundred miles of this along the actual valley of the Euphrates. Sir Charles Wing- field also objected to the proposed line that it is a sort of law, in railway operations, that through traffic alone, on a very long line of railway, will not pay. This after it had been fully explained that there would be local traffic on the Euphrates line, and the following interlocution had taken place between Mr. F. Walpole and General Chesney : 163. 'Sir George Jenkinson has asked you about local traffic; you, as an engineer officer, are, of course, aware of the Pacific Railway?'—'Yes.' 164. ' I believe that that railway now almost pays?' —'Yes,' 165. 'There is no local traffic upon that railway?' —' No.' General Chesney was subjected to a sharp cross- examination upon the details of the estimated saving of from seven to ten days. These details could not be given satisfactorily from memory, but the General sup plied them afterwards from his own memoranda, which showed that the difference in favour of the Euphrates line is, from London to Bombay, five hundred and twenty-eight miles, and from London to Kurrachi eight hundred and three miles. In reply to Sir George Jenkinson as to whether General Chesney did not consider that the two lines (that by the Suez Canal and that by the Euphrates \ T alley) might work together, and mutually assist each other rather than they should be antagonistic to each other, the General replied : ' Yes; the best proof whichmiles s. Sir ^ it iiJ ^tthroiightrai, yti ^ill not par icd tiiat tlierei ^e, and tie I- between Mr, F, | ■ i has asked to , er officer, are, ota, -'Yes.' st is' &amp;c upon ik nik jcted to asb:- se details could k y, ktthe(5®H own avour )aj. five li® 1 ^ akinson as to ' r ' : - Jer W 4'';' Jat by fc id mu 21 I can give of that is, that I proposed originally, in 1829, that both lines should be opened together, so that I never kept to one as an exclusive thing; I was of opinion that they would help one another consider ably.'—' One line (it was further suggested) might be used for the conveyance of goods, and the other for the conveyance of passengers?'—'Yes (was the reply), and you want both; there are people and commerce enough to occupy both, and you want both.' The committee sat for a second time on the 20th of July, when Mr. Ainsworth and Mr. Telford Macneil were examined. Mr. Ainsworth expressed his con viction, from a personal exploration of the routes through Asia Minor, and of all the great passes through Mount Taurus, from Kurdistan to Cilicia, that the proposed line of railway from the bay of Antioch to the Euphrates and down the Euphrates, was at once the most feasible and the most economical. The ter minus might be at the foot of Mount Casius, a little south of the embouchure of the Orontes, the bay of Antioch being shallower and rocky off the ancient port of Seleucia. Seleucia lies at the north end of the bay. The landing-place of the Euphrates Expedition was three or three and a half miles south of Seleucia, but north of the Orontes; the proposed pier, jetty, or breakwater would be south of the Orontes, near the foot of Mount Casius, at a spot known to the natives as Karabujak. The modern village of Suwaidiyah lies on the hills eastwards, between Seleucia and the Orontes. As a port, Mr. A. thought that a protective jetty would suffice. The railway might be carried thence either by22 the road north of the Orontes, used by the Euphrates Expedition, or by the valley of the Orontes, but the latter presented some difficulties. The only other difficulties lay in the limestone district between the lake of Antioch and Aleppo. Beyond, with the excep tion of a range of basaltic hills which are traversed by the Euphrates, near Zenobia,* no difficulties occur, and at this point a broad margin has been left between the hills and the river bed wide enough for many railways. Mr. A. considered the proposed line from Alexandretta by the pass of Bailan, or the Gates of Syria, would entail such heavy expenses, that even if a line was brought from Constantinople to Alex andretta by the Kulak Boghaz, or Gates of Cilicia, it would be preferable to keep along the coast to the bay of Antioch rather than to carry the line over the pass of Bailan. ' Seleucia,' Mr. A. said, ' is not only the natural gate to the East, formed by nature, and the entrance into Hamath, as it was called in ancient times,f but when you try to carry roads across Asia Minor, and across the Taurus, and across the countries to the north, you are carried back by the force of physical circumstances to that entrance into Syria, to the south of which is also one continuous chain of * That the remarkable ruins at the southern end of this pass, now known as Zelebe or Zilibi, represent a town named Zenobia, after the celebrated Queen of Palmyra, is shown by the account spven by Procopius of the campaigns of Belisarius, where Chosroes is described as marching in three days from Circe- sium to Zenobia (Bell. Persic., i. 18; ii. 5). Queeu Zenobia is described as flying to the banks of the Euphrates on the approach of Aurelian to Palmyra (Gibbon's Decl. and Fall, chap, xi.) f Hamath-Zobah, afterwards Epiphania, and now Hamah, appears to have been a different place from Hamath, for the Taimuds, the Jewisn Targums, and the ancient Syriac version of the Old Testament, all explain Hamath by Antioch —a city which must have had a name prior to the conquests of Alexander.23 hilly country, and hence it is that it is the only natural opening into the interior. A line of railway carried from Constantinople by the Gates of Cilicia, as proposed, would of necessity have to join the proposed Euphrates Valley Railway : it would be a complement to it.' Question 298. 'When you got to the Euphrates, your line would turn down and follow the course of the Euphrates?'—' Precisely so, saving the curves.' 299. 'What would be the total length of it?'—' I believe about five hundred miles.' What was here meant was the total distance to be followed along the Euphrates Valley from Balis or Jaber Castle to the alluvial plains of Babylonia, where the line would turn off to Baghdad. The total length of the proposed Euphrates Valley Railway from the Mediterranean to Bussorah or Mohammerah would be about eight hundred and fifty miles, and more, if pro longed to Bushire on one side of the Persian Gulf, or to Grain or Koweit on the other. TV hen Mr. Ains- worth describes the Hawi or plains along the banks ot the river in its upper portions as fertile, and the coun try beyond as desert, the latter word must be accepted in the sense of a wilderness, not of arid or sandy plains. There is almost always vegetation in the wildest regions of Syria or Mesopotamia. Xenophon s description ol old, of ' a country full of wormwood, if any other kind of shrubs or plants grew there, they had all an aromatic smell, but no trees appeared,' is as nearly accurate as can be given in modern times; there is vegetation, but it is of a peculiar character, and it is very questionable if any portions of such plains could24 be reclaimed, except where there is a plentiful supply of water for irrigation. Mr. A. also spoke favourably of the Arabs to be met with along the valley of the Euphrates, as open to conciliation; and he added, ' Probably it may be necessary sometimes to subsidise some of the shiekhs to a small extent; but the mere fact of carrying a railway through the country would bring the persons who were carrying out that under taking into constant contact with the Arabs, and would establish a friendly feeling with them; so much so, that they themselves would preserve a work in which they naturally must be led to take a part either as labourers or as providers of the necessities of life to those who were carrying out the undertaking.' Mr. A. was also examined upon the point of opening the ancient harbour of Seleucia, and he said that no doubt a large basin might be excavated close to Seleucia (or, in other words, the old harbour might be enlarged by excavation), but he was not prepared to say if such an undertaking would not be more expensive than con structing a harbour at the foot of Mount Casius, pro tected by a breakwater. He also gave testimony upon the comparative advantages of a harbour in the bay of Antioch over that of Alexandretta, and upon the centralising of the commerce of North Syria and Meso potamia at Aleppo. This indeed, owing to the diffi culties of communication with Constantinople, extends to beyond the Taurus in many districts, as was found to be the case in the valley of Gurun and Derendah, near Malatiyah. A change came over the prospect with the examina-25 tion of the civil engineers. Mr. Telford Macneil, who had been engaged with Sir John Macneil in conductino- o some of the surveys upon the coast of the Mediter ranean with a view to the Euphrates line, at once declared himself strongly in favour of Scanderoon (Iskendrun) or Alexandretta as the point of debarkation. The harbour there is at the head of a gulf^ and well sheltered. All that would be necessary would be a landing-place. The point suggested by Mr. Ainsworth at the foot of Mount Casius had been surveyed and given up. It would require a considerable amount of work, and not be a good harbour when done. This, it is to be suspected, applied to a site suggested by Sir John Macneil at the immediate foot of Mount Casius, and not to the point suggested by Mr. A., which was on the level between the Orontes and Mount Casius. It appears, however, from Mr. Telford Macneil's evidence, that no harbour was projected in the bay of Antioch, but it was proposed to convert the Orontes river into a navigable river for about a mile up, two piers to be thrown out across the bar, one on each side of the river. No wonder that such a project should have proved more expensive than a jetty at Alexandretta. Granting the superiority of the bay of Alexandretta over the bay of Antioch, which it is impossible to dis pute, there are expenses connected with the selection of such as a point of debarkation, as well as with any given point on the other bay. First, Alexandretta is not healthy, and it would require an estimated expen diture of from two to three thousand pounds to drain it. In the next place, the railway would have to becarried over the Bailan or Balan Pass, to an elevation of two thousand one hundred feet above the level of the sea, by a mean gradient of one in twenty-one, and a maximum gradient of one in thirteen. 399. (Sir Stafford Northcote.) 'With what gradients upon lines well known, and already in existence, would you compare that?'— ' I think that the best comparison would be with the Mont Cenis, and there the gradients are very much worse. 400. (Sir C. Wingfield.) 'That is on the Fell sys tem? 1 '—' Yes; and I think that this should be on the Fell system for fifteen miles, but not on the Fell gauge, but a continuous gauge all the way through of four feet eight and a half inches.' 1 Little did General Chesney, when he landed the material of the Euphrates Expedition from the George Canning, aided by the officers and crew of H.M .S. Columbine, and conveyed the segments of steam-boats, boilers (over two tons in weight), and a ponderous diving-bell, from thence by a comparatively open road to the Euphrates, dream that it would in future days be proposed to carry a railway by another road over a mountain pass comparable with Mont Cenis! It is not that the pass of Bailan is actually comparable with Mont Cenis in elevation, but the gradients for the two thousand one hundred feet are. Mr. W. J. Maxwell, one of the civil engineers employed on the same survey, spent in fact some time upon the Mont Cenis Railway on his way to Syria, his instructions being that there were not to be any curves or gradients upon the (ApP® 1 ILof Bail®' P^^oasand one al |L«fAiia* &amp; 80 * ■ is carried | i |e Pinara of I jribI talis of jaitof tk pass, i j mk Hie Mosqi ilierary, by S d : akkiM the ] I isrfiawny, ( j to the time •'M, Cilicia and ■ wd to tliis i I ^ktkky ( ^ i Sm of leye \ S-1, and M: ^^Meditem the ir # m work I ^ the ebitic found ; ^ of theproposed line more difficult than those upon the Mont Cenis Railway. (Appendix No. 4.) The pass of Bailan—the Gates of Syria—although only two thousand one hundred and seventy feet in elevation, is a very formidable and rocky pass. The most common rocks are clay-slate, sandstones, and limestones ('Ainsw. Res.,' p. 317); the schists or shales predominate so on the south side of the pass that no road is carried that way, but the town of Bailan (the Pinara of Pliny and Ptolemy, Erana of Cicero, and Pictanus of the Jerusalem Itinerary), near the summit of the pass, is on a firmer basis, with solid approaches. The Mosque was built, according to the Mecca Itinerary, by Sultan Selim, and the Khan by Sultan Sulaiman the Magnificent. There are also remains of a causeway, of an aqueduct, and of a bridge appertaining to the time of the Romans. ('Lares and Penates; or, Cilicia and its Governors,' p. 263.) As opposed to this we have a comparatively open country from the bay of Antioch to the city of same name. A line of levels was carried by Lieutenant Murphy, R. E., and Mr. W. T. Thompson, from the shores of the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and the section given in the maps which accompany General Chesney's great work on the Euphrates Expedition shows that the elevation between the sea and Antioch does not come up to five hundred feet. If, after Alex ander the Great founded Alexandreia ad Issum, now Alexandretta, or the more ancient Myriandrus was named after the victor at Issus, the Macedonian kingsof Antioch—his successors—founded the port of Seleu- ceia, or Seleucia Pieria, on the bay of Antioch, it could only be because that bay was more accessible than that of Issus or Alexandretta, and that the facilities of access overbalanced the superiority of the bay of Alexandretta if there was or is any real superiority. All history, and the magnitude of the ruins, attest to the importance of Seleucia Pieria as a port in the time of the Mace donians and of the Romans. It was also of great importance, in a military point of view, during the wars between the Seleucidse and the Ptolemies. (Polyhius, v. 58—60.) St. Paul and Barnabas embarked thence for Cyprus on their first mission to Asia Minor (Acts, xiii. 4.) 1 he harbour of Seleucia Pieria is two thousand feet long by twelve hundred feet wide, occupying an area of forty-seven acres, and it was in fact as large as the export and import basins of the East and West India Docks together. The inner port is entirely excavated, and its canal is one thousand feet long; the area of the outer port is about eighteen thousand feet square, and it affords good shelter, but is obstructed by sand. There are two moles, two hundred and forty paces apart, constructed of enormous stones, and a pier called that of St. Paul. ( aptain W. Allen, R.N., to whose work ('The Dead Sea, a New Route to India, 1 ' &amp;c.), we are indebted for the above figures, after remarking that ' The best and most obvious natural highway between Europe and the interior of Asia—that is, where there are the least obstructions—is through the lower valley of the : i apropos of 1 sjafit maybe j.-1 jjtlcr to reco: h'iltffllfis tllfK 1 s iiougii this an! elements of ;!!|cd siicii an o ikity of th i to compris k of tlie Oron i lipid prospe 'Mil flowed tk dioaNiQeTeh i w an empoi ® ^ lesopotami: !^8ofiiie i ^ tie country ^nder am ' :i ttamineil t H e29 A Orontes and by Aleppo, the basin of which is separated from that of the Euphrates and Tigris—the vast plains of Mesopotamia—by hills of very moderate elevation, such as would be easily surmounted even by a rail road,' adds, apropos of the reopening of the harbour of Seleucia, 'it may be asked why I propose to con struct, or rather to reconstruct a harbour on a coast where not only is there no commerce, but where there is even a very small population in scattered and poor villages. Although this is but too true, the original and natural elements of prosperity, which in former times required such an outlet, still remain in the inex haustible fertility of this wonderful country. This may be said to comprise, not only the neighbouring rich valleys of the Orontes and Bekaa, to which the cities of the Tetrapolis and many others owed their origin and rapid prosperity; but it was the channel through which flowed the riches of Mesopotamia, which gave birth to a Nineveh and a Babylon ; and even the Avealth of Persia and the furthest east have had and still may find an emporium in Seleucia. The great fertility of Mesopotamia was carried to its utmost limit by means of the numerous canals for irrigation with which the country was everywhere intersected; some of the largest of these were navigable. They excited the wonder and interest of Alexander the Great, who examined them personally, and 1 steered the boat himself.' He employed a great number of men to cleanse and repair them. ' Of all the countries I know,' says Herodotus, 1 it is without question the best and the most fertile. It produces neither figs nor30 vines, nor olives, but in recompense the earth is suit able for all sorts of grain, of which it yields always two hundred per cent., and in years of extraordinary fertility as much as three hundred per cent.' (Clio, p. 155, Fr. Trans.) ' These advantages inspired ancient rulers, mer- chants, capitalists, and engineers to construct works to which neither the destructive power of man, nor the convulsions of nature during more than two thou sand years, have been able to do irreparable injury. It is truly an enduring monument of the well-directed energies of its founders, and has vainly invited their apathetic successors to profit by so valuable a legacy. ' The commerce of the rich countries I have alluded to has, indeed, never ceased; for although almost anni hilated by the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, which enabled a maritime nation to divert the greater part of that route, some portion still flows languidly by a perverted course and an inferior outlet, owing to the neglect of this, its natural channel and emporium. Thus, the present trade of the East, centering in Aleppo, is carried on by means of camels and mules over the mountain pass of Bailan—the Syrian Gates and em barked at the unhealthy and inconvenient port of Skan- derun, at the head of the gulf of the same name. ' The produce of the great basin of the Euphrates and the Tigris, including Persia and the nations on the southern slopes of the Taurus and C aucasus, demands an outlet. The natural one is of course the Persian Gulf; but the stream of commerce does not set that way, the demand being in the west.

The greater development of the present day does not find the ocean route sufficient, and the time may come when its increasing exigencies ma}^ stretch its iron tentacles even across Mesopotamia. These are visions of the future; which, however, daily ex perience proves are nearer to the present than any one dares to imagine. Leaving these to be unfolded by time, the present facilities are amply sufficient for the present resources. ' The country possesses in itself locomotive power to an enormous amount, which is produced and wasted, waiting century after century for employment, I mean in the thousands and thousands of camels—ships of the desert—that live only to crop the luxuriant herbage of the wide countries of which they might convey the more valuable productions ; by a sluggish current, it is true, but sufficient in amount to fill more and greater marts and ports than Seleucia, and to call forth the swiftest energies of steam to carry off its slow and steady influx. In addition to all this, by the employment of their camels, the wandering Arab tribes would be re claimed to civilisation and religion. ' We may see what can be expected of the revival of commerce in these rich countries by what has been done at Bairut; where, with a port that affords less facilities for shipping goods than even Skandenin, the town has become three times as large as it was only twenty years ago. (This was in 1855. The progress has been still more remarkable of late.) But Seleucia with a port where ships could load and unload at the32 quad's without the tedious intervention of boats, and being safe from the delays of bad weather, would draw to itself the trade of all Aleppo, to which city a g'ood road could be made, and eventually a railroad, as it has been ascertained by General Chesney's valuable and careful survey that there are no obstacles to the construction of one. ' These fertile tracts now lie waste and unprofitable, except for imperfect and desultory cultivation b} 7 the hordes inhabiting the mountains on their borders, who, through devastating wars and a long series of bad governments, are reduced to such a condition of abase ment, both physical and moral, that they draw but the merest necessities of food and clothing from the varied and inexhaustible bounties of nature by which they are surrounded. With security and encouragement, how ever, they would not only become active cultivators of the raw material, and increasing consumers of it when returned to them in a manufactured state, but they would be zealous disseminators in regions which are now, from various impediments, inaccessible to British enterprise. ' If the better outlet were established, which the restoration of the fine harbour of Seleucia would afford, it is probable that many of the merchants of Aleppo, especially the Franks, would be induced to settle here, by the greater convenience they would find for their transactions, and by the greater chances of security for life and property here than at Aleppo, where they are in constant danger from the turbulent and fanatical p 33 '.^theautiunDof ^taiscam-a taoiigli industi i ill stationaiy on ' ; iitidty imptftfll t&lt; rewards of inc improved .■)®late the glorif vinliDOl but be b rj it would bring gi ilk regions now itothestrengtli of iitbg vigour to v :' kspiinig. in t ieopitai sKkaeri ' mean? form m the wini hM (xvi 2 ^fbiasUdatog ^ of the* mot .

' The fine scenery and beautiful climate of the valley of the Orontes might also attract emigrants or specu lators from England, while the native population of the north, or right bank of the Orontes—who are all Christians, and though industrious and well-disposed are poor, and stationary on the soil—would have energy and elasticity imparted to them by the example of settlers and the rewards of increasing prosperity. So that from these germs improved grades of society would soon arise to emulate the glories of ancient Seleucia. Such a result could not but be beneficial to the Turkish government, as it would bring great increase of revenue to its coffers from regions now yielding little or none. It would add to the strength of the empire, and be the means of imparting vigour to distant provinces, now exhausted and languishing, in the efforts made for the benefit of the capital.' General Chesney and Captain W. Allen, R.N., both estimated the expense of reopening this port to naviga tion, chiefly by the means formerly used by the inha bitants, of letting down the winter floods by the ravine. Strabo tells us, indeed (xvi. 2, 8), that the ancient name of the place was Udatos Potamoi, or u Elvers of Water,' descriptive of these mountain torrents.* * The extensive and remarkable ruins at Scleucia Pieria have been described ity Pococke, by General Cbessney in bis ' Expedition to ibe Euphrates, by Captain W. Allen, KN., 'The Dead Sea, a New Route to India,' vul. ii ; p. 210, et seq., and in 'Lares and Penates; or, Cilicia and its Governors, P- 268. There is a very interesting engraving in the latter work ot the vallty34 ' The great advantages to be gained by opening this port are ' (to quote ' Cilicia and its Governors,' p. 269), ' that it is nearer at hand than that of Alexan- dretta; that it avoids the difficult navigation of the Gulf of Issus; that whereas Alexandretta is infamous as one of the most unhealthy spots on the coast of Syria, and hence few can be induced to reside there, Seleucia is a comparatively healthy spot, and would, if opened to commerce, soon become in all probability a flourishing town; that the road from Seleucia to An- tioch, Aleppo, and the Euphrates is comparatively open, while that from Alexandretta has to cross the formid able Syrian Gates—the mountain pass of Bailan— between Amanus and Rhosus; that while Cilicia is constantly disturbed by local dissensions and the re bellion of races, the neighbourhood of Seleucia, chiefly tenanted by peaceful Christians, is remarkable for its tranquillity and security; and, lastly, Seleucia would constitute the safest harbour (especially for steamers) on the whole coast of Syria, and would, from that circumstance, and from its greater proximity to Antioch and Aleppo, entirely supersede the ports of Bairut, of Tripoli, and Latakiyeh (and, it might have been added, of Alexandretta). The same circumstances that have existed from the period of Mr. John Barkers settling here (' Cilicia and its Governors' was in part written by Mr. Barker's son, W. Burckhardt Barker, long time of the Orontes, with the bay of Antioch and Mount Casius in the background, from a sketch by Mr. C. F. Barker, which gives an excellent general idea ot the valley. So also with regard to the illustrations in General Chesnej's large work.a resident on the spot), and which induced General Chesney to adopt it as the site for landing the steam boats and equipments of the Euphrates Expedition, still exist; and at a very moderate outlay Seleucia might be again rendered what it once was, the most capable, the most flourishing, the most fertile, the most populous, the most wealthy, the most beautiful, and the most healthy port of Syria.' The most important consideration in favour of a port or place of debarkation in the bay of Antioch after those of feasibility, of economy, and of an open road, is that it is self-contained. It is protected on one side by Mount Casius and its offshoots towards Antioch, and on the other by Mount Rhosus and its spur towards the sea, known to the ancients as Mount Coryphaeum, and whence the surname of Seleucia Pieria, or the 'Stony,' and now called, from its ruggedness, Ras Khanzir, or the ' Boar's Head.' The valley of the Orontes, whilst it presents the easiest opening from the Mediterranean into Syria, along the whole coast, is indeed, at the same time, the most secluded, the least liable to interference from without, and the most easily defended. Alexandretta, in contrast with Seleucia, has never been a town. The superior genius of Alexander has, it has been said, been shown in the selection of Alex- andreia ad Issum and of Alexandreia, the Hellenic capital of Egypt. But it does not appear from the records of antiquity or of modern times, that the former ever prospered. It is true that it has been for many c 2 -36 years the port of Aleppo, and factories or stores were once established there, but such is the unhealthiness of the place that no one lives there who can help it. In Pococke's time it was only ' a miserable poor town that has rather the appearance of a small village. ' The air,' says the learned doctor, ' causes a sort of lingering disorder, often attended with a jaundice, and if they do not change the air they commonly die; it also often throws persons, when they first come, into violent and mortal fevers.' ' The Europeans live most in Bailan, and always sleep there, and if by accident they are obliged to lie here, it is worse than if they had stayed in Scanderoon all the summer.' When Niebuhr visited it, it contained only sixty or seventy mean houses. ' Alexandretta is now the tomb of all who inhabit it for any length of time without any change of air.' ('Lares and Penates,' p. 114.) Lieutenant Murphy, R.E., Mr. W. Thomson, and the writer, were all three seized with a violent fever whilst engaged in surveying the coast, and were glad to take refuge on board a merchantman lying in the harbour. This was in 1835, in the time of M. Martenelli's agency. In 1840 the writer found the place somewhat improved under Mr. Hayes. ('Trav.,' &amp;c., p. 92.) It is pro posed to drain the place, and thus render it healthy, at an expense of some two or three thousand pounds. But it is questionable if this can be effectually done, as part of the marsh appears to lie below the level of the sea. At all events it was tried by Ibrahim Pasha without success.

It would also be carried across the plain to the north of the lake of Antioch, till at a distance of forty-seven miles from the sea it would meet the range of limestone hills which divide the plain of Antioch from the plain of Dana. The great objection to this portion of the line is that it does not include the town of Antioch in its progress; other objections pre sent themselves in the fact that the plain north of the lake, near the Kara Su, is at times flooded—so much so, that there are at that point the remains of an extensive * The marshes in the neighbourhood of Iskenderun, of such melancholy celebrity for their fatality to Europeans, anpear to occupy a spot taken from the bay by the gradual accumulation of gravelly detritus, causing a gradual increase of land, ultimately filling up the inlet and shutting out the sea, while at the same time the interior being lower than the bank of detritus on the shore, has caused the waters of abundant springs—Jacob's (or Joseph's) Well—- to spread themselves over the land. These have, however, in later times been much drained. At present the marsh is formed of a boggy soil, containing much iron and mud, with anodontse and other fresh water shells; while below, beds of sands and of marls, with recent marine aud littoral shells, were turned up in digging the drain. The building called Godefroy de Bouillon's Castle would indicate a change in the condition of the soil; and in an old Italian chart the author has seen it is marked as close to the shore, from which it is now nearly a mile distant. Major Rennell proposed an examination of the slate of the castle, in order to compare its height from the present level as compared with that reported by Mr. Drummond about seventy years ago. The dHl'ercnce ot level, however, in alluvia deposited in a scarcely tidal sea, does not in the intervening valleys indicate the increase of new lands so much as the difference in horizontal distance. (Res. in Assyria, &amp;c., p. 319.)38 causeway raised on arches, known as that of Murad Pasha. The direct prolongation of the line eastward would also bring it in contact with the worst portion of the limestone hills. To obviate this, Mr. T. Macneil would carry it southwards to the pass of Sansareen, or Kassara-al-Benal, or it is to be supposed to about the same point it would be carried if passing from Antioch to Aleppo south of the lake. Mr. Telford Macneil gave evidence that to make a good harbour at the Orontes ' as we propose' (that is, converting the Orontes into a navigable river), would cost half a million of money, and a railway to a common point, beyond Bailan or Balan Pass, would cost five hundred and thirty-two thousand pounds more, as against the cost of the Balan line to the same point, namely, four hundred and fifty- five thousand pounds. A railway over the Balan would actually be cheaper than a railway up the Orontes to that same point.' 457. (Sir 0. Wingfield.) ' How comes it to be cheaper, because one goes over a much more difficult ground than the other. Leaving out the harbour, you say that a railway over the Balan would be cheaper ?' —' Yes.' 458. ' How is that, when it has to go over a pass, and the other line goes over level ground ?'— u It is very easy to understand it. This is the Mediterranean, and it is cut off from the inland by a high range of mountains all along the coast, and the only outlet is that hy the river Orontes (the italics are ours), which goes through the mountains; and in order to go up there? cro# t S MM39 you have to cross the river very many times; it is a large river with considerable floods. I have the details of the plans, and the. matter has been worked out cor rectly, so that I am speaking with confidence.' 459. (Mr. F. Walpole.) ' Had you not forty bridges and culverts by the survey P'—' yes.' The comparison here made, it will be observed, is not between the expenses of a line from the Mediterranean to Aleppo by the valley of the Orontes, but by the banks of the river Orontes, with a line by the Bailan Pass. In the first place, the rendering the mouth of the Orontes navigable would appear to be objectionable on the score of expense alone. Such an operation would, it is estimated, cost half a million of money, whereas laying aside the question of a jetty, General Chesney and Captain Allen, R.N., estimated, we have seen, the cost of reopening the ancient harbour of Seleucia at only thirty thousand pounds, which would be actually less than the expense of constructing a jetty at Alexandretta, the construction of a landing- pier at which place is estimated by Mr. Telford Macneil (Ans. 432) at fifty thousand pounds. But where is the necessity for following the banks of the river Orontes at all ? When the Euphrates Expe dition landed at the mouth of the river its course was at once explored, and it was found to be enclosed within precipitous rocks at a few miles from its embouchure. This line was then at once abandoned, and the material of steam-boats, &amp;c., was conveyed across the country north of the river, but still in the valley of Antioch,40 nor did the road thus adopted once cross the river till it reached the bridge of Antioch itself. A line of levels was subsequently carried by Lieutenant Murphy, R.E., and Mr. W. Thomson, from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and it appears from that that the elevation between the sea and Antioch is under five hundred feet, as compared with two thousand one hundred feet at Bailan. Dr. Pococke, after visiting the ruins of Seleucia, says: 'I crossed the plain southwards about four miles to the Orontes. From the mountains the country appears like a plain all the way to Antioch ; but about a league to the east from the sea there are low hills almost as far as that city, which have fruitful valleys between them.' In a question, then, of such great importance in the view of outlay, commercial, sanitary, and political advantages, it may fairly be held that the comparison, backed as it is by the authority of eminent engineers, does not hold good, and that no decision ought to be arrived at in a question of such magnitude until a com parison has been made by actual survey of the expenses that would be entailed by a railway carried along the road used for the transport of the material of the Euphrates Expedition (not by the banks of the river) with those of a railway carried over the Bailan Pass, some fifteen or sixteen miles in length. If we read Mr. T. Macneil's figures (Answer No. 398) correctly, the ascent and descent of the Bailan Pass comprise fifteen or sixteen miles of difficult country, whereas it is only fifteen or sixteen from Seleucia to Antioch by a compa-41 ratively easy country. It would require a phalanx of civil engineers to satisfy the mind that the expenses of sixteen miles of a rocky pass would be less than a line of sixteen miles over a country not rising to an elevation of five hundred feet. With some forty skew bridges and culverts the comparison might be established, but if it can be shown that these are not wanted, the com parison no longer holds good. From Antioch to the limestone hills by Jisr Hadid—the ' iron bridge' and the Pontisfer of the Crusaders # —the country is, as it also is from the eastern foot of Bailan, very level; but by the line from Seleucia to Antioch, in addition to the advantages before enumerated, the town itself would be served, and sixteen miles of the most beautiful country in the world opened to occupation and settlement. So satisfied was Mr. Barker, long time consul in Egypt, with the salubrity of the valley of Antioch, that he retired there upon ceasing his official labours; and Dr. Holt Yates, a physician of experience, proposed to establish a sanitarium there for Anglo-Indians. The pass of Bailan, although the town of Bailan is itself a pleasant and healthy mountain residence, presents no thing to compare with the long valley of Antioch to tempt Europeans to reside there. The latter was the * Sir John Macneil, in his evidence (Answ. 846), describes this bridge as th only way from Aleppo to Scanderoon. ' At a toll-bar on one of the old Roman briages over the Orontes,' he says, ' I stopped some hours, and I got a list of the amount of traffic which passed through it, and I found, by very careful examination of extracts from it, that there were ten thousand camels, and horses, and males which passed weekly through that toll-bar. It was the only way iu which they could get from Aleppo to Scanderoon, so that there was sot a single ton of goods which did not go that way.' K;42 site of the ancient Daphne, renowned throughout all antiquity for the charms of its woods and waters, and for the luxuriousness and dissipation entailed by a too prolific nature in a wanton climate. Captain Charlewood, E.N., acting-lieutenant of the Euphrates Expedition, was called in before the com mittee at its sitting of July 24, 1871. Captain Charle wood expressed it as his opinion—the result of long practical acquaintance with the country and with the whole of the proposed line—that 'the only route which this nation ought to undertake would be from the bay of Antioch, or Scanderoon, down the valley of the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf.' Captain Charlewood would also select the south-east end of the bay of Antioch as the starting-point, because, from the expe rience he has had there, it is, he says, the best anchor age ; and moreover, in the prevailing winds (the westerly winds), they do not blow home there as they do in the north of the bay, or even direct upon the Orontes. lie preferred the bay of Antioch to that of Alexandretta, because the latter is unhealthy, and more over, the Bailan Pass, although no doubt it is prac ticable for the engineers, would be a costly undertaking to get through. Captain Charlewood at the same time believed it to be practicable to render Alexan dretta healthy by draining the marshes. The harbour itself is the finest on the coast, and can contain any amount of shipping. On the point proposed at the south-east point of the bay nothing more would be required than a breakwater run out; the anchorage is43 excellent, and vessels of the size of the Indian troop ships would be able to lie there, and to disembark troops. 'The line would then pass for about four miles along the valley of Swadea (or Suwaidyah, Seleueia Arabicised), when it would enter the course of the Orontes, and follow it more or less up to Antioch ; this last part would be the most difficult of the whole railway.' Captain Charlewood, leaving the south-east corner of the bay of Antioch, would apparently carry the line across the bay to the pass of the Orontes; but if such a line was found to be difficult and ex pensive, it could be carried by a single bridge across the Orontes, below the pass, so as to join the line of the Euphrates transport, and a comparison instituted of the expenses and difficulties attendant upon the road along the banks of the Orontes, and the road followed by the Euphrates transport up the valley of Antioch. Whilst Mr. Telford Macneil would cross the river Euphrates at or near Balis, a step rendered objection able by the basaltic pass above Zenobia being open only on the right bank. Captain Charlewood would cross somewhere about Anah, which would be unobjection able, and probably very desirable. Captain Charlewood would also select Muhammara as a terminus—a point which will be afterwards referred to. Captain Charle wood further bore the most favourable and satisfactory evidence, founded upon experience, as to the character of the native population—those settled on the river. Captain Charlewood assuming that a railway over the Bailan would cost less to carry a railway from the44 mouth, of the Orontes up to the same point, and assuming also that Alexandretta is made a healthy harbour, would, like Mr. Ainsworth (comp. answer 348 with 613), give the preference to the latter; but this, as has been before shown, is assuming those two points to be settled. A comparison of expense ought to be made as between the pass of Bailan and the line of the Euphrates transport from the Orontes to Antioch, as well as with a line by the pass of the Orontes, and along the banks of that river. Captain Charlewood was also cross-examined upon the character of the country in respect to adaptation to cultivation along the banks of the Euphrates, and his replies were emi nently satisfactory. The fact is, however, that this is a point very difficult to explain except in detail. The character of the banks in so long a course varies very much. As a general rule, the trend of the river is, like others, tortuous. The friable rocks which constitute the low uplands, and which are mostly covered with a coarse vegetation, come closer to the river at each ad vancing angle. Between each promontory thus con stituted, and alternately on each side of the river, are grassy alluvial plains called Hawi, which vary in extent at almost every point. These Hawi are all arable land. Many are cultivated, and have their own villages or towns. Sometimes these grassy plains are not mere Hawi, but are of great extent. Such are the plains upon which the Beni Fakal encamp in thousands, north of Balis, and such are the plains near Rakkah, at Deir (town with cultivation), at Kirkisiyah on the Khabur (same), at Mayadin or Rahabah (same), at Wurdi, at A145 Kayim, at Anah (on the right bank), and at many other places. The extent of the grassy lands, again, from the river banks into the interior, varies from half a mile to distances that extended beyond the horizon. Grassy and fertile lands were also met with in the interior. It is again difficult to say how far cultivation might or might not be carried if the lands were irri gated. Below Anah stony soils were cultivated in former times by means of gigantic water-wheels. Below Felujah all is alluvial plain, and the greater part ot Babylonia and Chaldaea is open to cultivation. It is safe, however, to adopt as a principle, that the alluvial plains and valleys along the river are the best adapted to settlement and cultivation ; that the stony soils clad with a coarse vegetation, commonly called ' desert or 'wilderness,' are not available; and that the excep tions rather prove the rule than contradict it. 1 here is enough alluvial soil along the banks of the Euphrates to support millions.* Upon the question of carrying the line hj Bu to Dyarbekir, Captain Charlewood at once said he did not like it at all. 661. 'Why not?'— ' For the reasons which I have * Mr. T. K. Lynch, speaking of the so-called ' desert;' ^XTor e^ and Damascus, said he had travelled over the country in .■ u Travellin'' and it vas all a green plain covered with verdure and i^e over it in July, it was a red kind of clay, with a hunii gra { cultivated a prairie.

If you want a route to India, I presume that the shortest is the best.' 663. ' By taking the route through Urfah, and Dyar bekir, and Mosul, would there be greater local traffic ?'■— &lt;c I am inclined to doubt that. I think that more traffic would be got down the bank of the Euphrates; not immediately of course, but ultimately.' This was a very felicitous way of putting it. A rail way to Urfah, Dyarbekir, and Mosul would at first have more local traffic than a railway by Balis or Jaber Castle, but not sufficiently so to cover the enormous difference of expenditure or the delay occasioned by such a roundabout way to or from India. The com merce of the three towns above mentioned also already centres in Aleppo, and this would be still more the case when that city had a railway station. It would, in fact, be a fair experiment, if a first portion of the rail* way was constructed from the Mediterranean to Aleppo as a beginning, A prolongation of the same by the Euphrates Valley would ultimately absorb the traffic and commerce, not only of North and Eastern Syria, ^ioitoapropc '''ai ^ ^ ^ bva _____47 m tk but of all Mesopotamia, Babylonia, and Chaldosa, and also of the countries beyond the Tigris, and of many parts of Persia. Mr. Thomas K. Lynch, the next examined, made particular allusion to a proposed Russian route through the Caucasus, and by the Caspian Sea to Teheran and Ispahan, and by Shiraz to Yezd and Kurrachi. As this line is said to be already completed as far as Rostov, north of the Sea of Azov, it may possibly be carried out with the progress of time. If so, however objection able it may be in a strategetical point of view, it would, in the absence of any other line, be certainly used by wayfarers to and from India, and it would carry the commerce of the East to, or through, Russia. The next line to which Mr. Lynch called attention, and which he pronounced to be ' the Overland Route to India, the very best for England to take up, if money is no object,' would go from Constantinople to Amasia, Sivas, and to a pJace called Arabkir on the Euphrates. 'It is,' Mr. Lynch continued, ''between Sivas and Arabkir that the first difficulties would occur, where the anti-Taurus range of mountains is met with; but Mr. Taylor has discovered, only the year before last, a valley which passes through it, and offers no lifficulties whatsoever to the passage of a railway into the plains beyond Moosh, along Lake \ an, Khoi, Tabreez, and thence to Teheran,' where it would join the Russian line to Kurrachi. This project appears in its first portion scarcely to have been adopted by a person intimate with details. Araasia, at an elevation of eleven hundred and forty-48 eight feet above the sea, is separated from the valley of the Halys by hills rising to two thousand three hundred and ninety-eight feet in height. The town itself is situated in a narrow ravine, with limestone precipices of nearly a thousand feet in elevation. A sketch of the place, given as a frontispiece to W. J. Hamilton's u Researches in Asia Minor,' &amp;c., will best give an idea of the very remarkable position of this town, with the tombs of the kings on the face of its rocky preci pices. Why then go by Amasia to Sivas, when there is an open road by the valley of the Halys from Hajji Hamsah, on the high road to Constanti nople, to that place? A glance at the geological sec tions which are attached to Mr. Ainsworth's ' Researches in Assyria,' &amp;c., will show what the country is like between Sivas and Arabkir. Sivas stands itself on a plain three thousand eight hundred and ninety-four feet above the level of the sea. The country rises thence gradually to the Kara Bel mountains (ancient Paryadres), five thousand seven hundred and ninety feet. Thence it descends to cross over two lesser mountain ranges, one four thousand two hundred and fifty, the other four thousand four hundred and fifty, to Divrigi, three thousand one hundred and sixteen feet above the sea. Thence it ascends the rugged Karsi mountains (five thousand six hundred and seventy feet), descends to Berastik to re-ascend the Ayeli mountain, and has another range to cross— Arab-Baba—at an elevation of four thousand eight hundred and eight feet before reaching Arabkir, at an elevation of three thousand five hundred and IIMfrom tin The to?i mestone tion.

Arabkir is itself situated in a valley between the last-mentioned range and the Gul Tagh, having about the same elevation. At the head of the valley are the basaltic mountains called Kara Baba, or 'the father of blackness.' A detailed description of the country intervening between Sivas and Arabkir will be found in 'Res. in Assyria,' p. 282 et seq., and in 'Travels in Asia Minor/' vol. ii. p. 5 et seq. The discovery by Mr. Taylor of a valley passing through this difficult country is a fact unquestionably of the highest importance. As we have as yet had no details, it is impossible to say anything for or against its practicability. It is easy to imagine that the valley of Arabkir may be prolonged on the other side of the Euphrates, by the great plain of Moosh, or Mush, to the Nimrod Tagh, but it is difficult to understand how or where a valley can be prolonged from Sivas to Arabkir. If such a valley exists, it is strange that it is not used as the tatar road, or the post road and highway between Dyarbekir and Malatiyah to Constantinople. The permanency of roads (such as they are) in Asia Minor and Syria, is one of the remarkable peculiarities of the countries in question, and such a peculiarity is owing to the physical conformation of the soil. In very rare instances do the routes of the present day differ %)m what they were in the time of the Greeks and the Romans. Alexander the Great followed in the footsteps of Cyrus the Younger, when he led his army by the Kulak Boghaz to the pass of Bailan. The Ptolemies and Seleucias —Vespasian, Sapor, Constantius, Heraclius— the Khalifs, the Byzantine Emperors, the Sultans of50 Turkey, the Crusaders, all in succession crossed the same passes. A hundred examples might be adduced, founded on the comparison of ancient sites and roads, as given in the Antonine Itinerary and Theodosian tables, with existing towns, villages, or ruins, of the permanency of roads in the East. The writer crossed a narrow pass in the limestone hills between the upper valley of the Orontes and Edlip, where the track was so confined, that horses' and mules' feet seemed to fall into the same holes; indeed, it would have been dangerous had it been otherwise. These holes were several inches, some times a foot, in depth; and this in limestone rock as hard as marble, it must have taken ages of traffic to bring about. It is difficult, then, to understand that there should exist an open route from Sivas to Arabkir, and that it should have remained unknown until the year before last. Nothing but the trustworthy sources whence the information is derived would induce one to believe in the thing, which unquestionably must exist in some form or other. The expenses of this line from Constantinople to Ispahan is, it is to be observed, estimated at twenty million pounds, against eight million pounds, the rough estimate of the Euphrates Valley route. The latter was noticed by Mr. Lynch as his third alternative. He made the terminus the bay of Antioch, not Alexandretta, and carrying it by Aleppo to the Euphrates (why Birijik or Bir is introduced is not quite clear), he would leave the river at Jaber Castle, whence the railway ' would form a segment with the Euphrates, and proceed direct across the plain to Deir,S1011 crossed tW ' ' .no )f the pei rossed a M ^assoconfii^li o fall into tk n ^ dangerous laiij se\ era! mcimj sou in limestone rod ii ij to undeotaidi | romSivastoirallii, d unknoM mtt e trustwortliyw id would induce t unquestionalilj mi ; expenses of tils It it is to be olwd rands, against f' ateoftbeEnpiffl' •. Lyncliaslilst® 1 is Introduced is 1 ' river at n a segment ^ :083 ito skirting thereby the ruins of Resafa, which is not far from Palmyra; then along the fine lower table-land which runs at the foot of a line of hills which skirt the desert to Rahabah, on the Euphrates.' A first objection to a route as thus proposed is that although there may be a little saving in distance by thus crossing segments of the interior, instead of merely crossing bends of the river, by carrying the line in the interior you remove it, especially during construction, away from the first of all necessities in such a climate —water. In the second place, if there ever existed the slightest danger from wandering Arabs, these would be more likely to manifest themselves the further you get from the settled banks of the river; and lastly, you take away one of the great objects of the railway, the future settlement of the valley of the Euphrates. Resafa, the Resapha of the ' Notitia Imperii,' and probably the Rezeph of 2 Kings, xix, 12, and Isaiah, xxxvii. 12, and subsequently called Sergiopolis, is a well-known site on the high road from Tadmor to Tiphsah, or, in a later language, from Palmyra to Thapsacus, when the Romans constructed the strata or causeway which traversed the Barbaricus Campus, or plain of Siffin, so celebrated for the sanguinary combats fought there between Ali and Moawiyah. By carrying the railway across this plain, the easterly bend of the river fiom Sara to Rakka—the favourite abode of arun-ar-hashid—would be in part saved, but the old commercial route, which from Rakkah followed the ' eus or Bilecha river to Seruj, Haran, and Urfah, 80 which would be brought to life again by the d 252 railway passing nigh Thapsacus and Rakkah, would be very probably put into jeopardy for the sake of a few miles. Few sites of greater interest by their past his- tory, or of greater importance as capable of once more constituting centres of population, cultivation, and commerce, than Sura, Thapsacus, and Rakkah, present themselves along the whole line of the Euphrates Valley, and to lose all these advantages for the sake of saving a few miles across the stony plain of Siffin and by the ruinous Resafa, does not appear judicious. Rakkah—ancient Callinicum, Dakia, or Chalne of Ben- jamin of Tudela—would, trom its position at the mouth of the old ' Royal River' of Mesopotamia, near the ford of Thapsacus, on the highway from Urfah, Harran, and Seruj to Palmyra and Damascus, and in a fertile district, in all probability become as populous and flourishing a city, with a railway close by, as in the times of Harun-ar-Rashid and Al-Mamun. Tiphsah, the extremity of Solomon's kingdom, was also, as Thapsacus, 'a great and wealthy town' (Xenoph. 'Anab,' i. 4; 'Arrian Exped. Alex.' iii., 17). Sura also, to judge by the extent of its remains, must have been a large place. It was a Roman garrison of some importance under Belisarius, but was taken and burnt by Chosroes I. ( a.d . 532). It was afterwards fortified b}^ order of Justinian, and was an episcopal see under the Lower Empire (Procopius., 'Bell. Persic.,' i. 18; ii. 5; ' De (Edificiis Justiniani,' ii. 9). Pliny cor rectly describes its position under the name of lira, as at the point where the Euphrates turns to the East from the deserts of Palmyra (v. 24, s. 87). It is very question-53 able if Sura was not the city, and Tiphsah, u the passing over,' afterwards Thapsacus, the ford or bridge over the river. The ruins at Phumsah, as the latter place is now called, are very insignificant compared to the extent of mounds at Sura, and it is scaicely likely that there would have been two cities of importance on the same bank of the Euphrates at such a short distance from one another. The objection to this would be that Pliny notices both Ura and Thapsacus {nunc Amphipholis), and that Ptolemy also distinguishes the two, but the pass or bridge may have always been distinguished from the city. The Syrians called Thapsacus 'Turmida,' and the ' Flavia firma Sura' of Cellarius ('Not. Orb. Antiq.,' ii. 367), from the 'Notitia Imperii Orientales,' should, according to Mannert, be read 'Flavia Turina Sura/ There is an obvious connexion between Turmida and Turina. But to turn from this digression to Mr. Lynch's pro posed deviation at the easterly bend of the Euphrates to Resafa, and u then along the fine lower table-land which runs at the foot of a line of hills which skirt the desert to Rahabah on the Euphrates. It is difficult to understand if a line along the banks oi the Euphrates is meant, or a line in the interior. The basaltic range of the Jebel Bushir, or Abu Shahir, which cross from Palmyra, north of Zenobia, to unite with the Jebel Munkbar and Abd-ul-Assiz hills in Mesopotamia, lie between the two points, and afford no level passage save by the banks of the river.* But Mr. Lynch says * In the intervening space between Rakkah and Zenobia, the wo 5 ! mo notonous portion of tlie river, and some sixty-four and a half miles m distance,54 direct across the plain to Deir,' which latter place is beyond the basaltic hills, and then along ' a lower table-land to Rahabah.' It is to be observed upon this that the distance from Zenobia to Deir is by the river thirty-eight miles; the distance from Deir to the Khabur is twenty-two miles, ' the country a nearly uniform and level plain.' (' Res.' p. 73). Seven miles beyond is the town and plain of Mayadin, with the old castle of Rehoboth-ha-Nahar, or ' of the river 1 ' (Gen. xxxvi. 37), now called Rahabah-al-Hamra, or the ' Red,' and it is difficult to see what can be gained by leaving the banks of the river, except at the limestone and gypsum cliffs of Salahiyah, or Rahabah-al-Malik, twenty-one miles lower down than Rahabah-al-Hamra, where possibly a slight deviation may be less expensive than a tunnel, but that is questionable. The railway, then, according to Mr. T. K. Lynch, would follow the course of the river (that is, we sup pose, from Rahabah-al-Hamra, or Rahabah-al-Malik), passing Anah to Haditha, on the Euphrates. At Haditha it would cross Mesopotamia to Dokhala, on the Tigris, nine hours above Baghdad. This latter place is, we are told, in steam communication with India. By going to Dokhala you escape all the rivers and canals in the vicity of Baghdad.' The suggestion is well meant, and if the line was car ried across the Tigris at Dokhala, it would have firm and level land to Baghdad. (This city is, it is to be there were two liawi, four forests, or groves of poplar, two sandy points, five tracts of graminse, or pasture, with villages, twelve marshy districts, chiefly about Abu Said, twelve cultivated spots, four quarters of low jungle, eight tracts of arteuiisia (wormwood), and twenty-seven of tamarix.

But from Haditha, or Hadisa, the rails would have to be carried over a low, hilly, and stony country to near the Tigris; whereas below the Pylae, or Gates of Babylonia—the Gates of Paradise of the Talmuds (Neubauer. ' Geo. du Talmud,' p. 327)—the plain is a flat and level alluvium. The marshes around Akka Kuf unquestionably present a serious obstacle to a direct line from Felujah, at the head of the plain, to Baghdad; but a line could assuredly be found north of the Sakla- wiyah Canal, or between it and the Abu Gharrib, or Ghuraib, without bridges having to be constructed. This, however, is a matter of detail which would have to be decided by the [engineers when carrying out a survey preliminary to the positive laying down of the rails. Mr. T. K. Lynch explained that the proposed line would go from Dokhala to Mendali, on the Persian and Turkish frontier, thence to Disful. ' From Baghdad,'' he observed, ' it is very practicable to get to Ispahan, and to follow the other route to India, or to proceed along the northern shore of the Persian Gulf by Mikran to India. This, strategically, would be the best line for the English government to undertake. The termini would be, according to Mr. Lynch, in reply to further questions, Kurrachi on one side, and Suwaidiyah, or Seleucia, on the other. In explanation also of the proposed line to Ispahan, Mr. Lynch said: ' I think that if the English government guarantee a liw in this country, they ought to leave out of question56 those lines which eventually must be made by commerce, for instance, to Mosul, Dyarbekir, and Teheran ; all those lines must fall in, and must join the main trunk line. Mosul is only one hundred and sixty miles from this very line, and therefore a tramroad or railroad would very soon be made, and they would all be feeders of the direct line. 1 ' This is a view of the question before insisted upon, and of the utmost importance to be kept in sight. Mosul, or Moosul, could be brought into connexion with the main trunk line either by the valley of the Khabur, as before noticed, or by the valley of the Tigris. For goods going to Aleppo or Europe there would be great saving of distance by the first line; the latter would best serve the purposes of Baghdad. At all events, till the lines suggested are carried out, which is as yet a remote thing, the usual caravan trade would find its way from Mosul by Bir to Aleppo, or by the Sinjar to Kakkah, or by the Tigris to Baghdad, according to the objects proposed to themselves by the merchants. Mr. Lynch did not think that the funds could be got even foi the main trunk line without a guarantee from the British government. The Russian line would, Mr. Lynch also pointed out, be constructed on guarantees from the Russian government, and it might be added that at the present price of guaranteed Russian stock in the money market, there is nothing to prevent that government carrying a railway in any direction it might elect to India, thus turning the trade and transit of the East to their own country. The money would always be forthcoming upon a Russian government guarantee,57 a little below par at five per cent., at, par at six per cent. This is a consideration worthy of being meditated upon by the British government. Is it precisely worth while, is a fair question to ask, by refusing a guarantee, or declining to enter into a joint guarantee with Turkey, to allow the transit and trade of the East to be mono polised by Russia, and the future tenure of our vast Indian possessions to be jeopardised ? The line from Constantinople by Sivas, Arabkir, Van, and Tabreez to Teheran is, Mr. Lynch tells us, much favoured by the Turkish and Persian governments (Answ. 696), and it ' would certainly, commercially speaking, be a paying line' (Answ. 700). 'It would monopolise the whole of the Persian trade which now goes by Poli and Trebizond.'' But so also would the line by the Euphrates Valley, Baghdad, and Disful to Bushire. This would be still more the case if a branch line could be carried across at the most available point in the great mountain range which separates Persia from Turkey, and which becomes more and more prac ticable the further it trends to the south. Mr. Lynch bore further testimony to the increase of the trade of Baghdad, which, he says, has quadrupled within the last ten years, and may be estimated at about one million sterling a year. With only a mountain road, it supplies the markets of Kirmanshah and Hama- dan, and goods sometimes reach as far as Ispahan and Central Persia. Mr. Lynch, who was opposed to Bus- sorah as a terminus, was in favour of Suwaidiyah as a port of debarkation on the Mediterranean. ' I have been twice over the Bailan Pass,' he said, 'but still II I 58 would carry the route by the Orontes, as being the most feasible.' Upon the subject of the Euphrates Valley route, in reply to the question, ' I apprehend that in your opinion the effect of a railway along that country would be to make a population settle there ?' Mr. Lynch replied : 'I think that a railway along that line would not be practicable, were it not attended by colonies along the lines. The country is magnificent, and it only requires to be opened by railway communication. I look,' added Mr. Lynch,' 'upon the establishment of a railway in those countries as the commencement of a kingdom. Railways, as we know, bring security with them, and when you get security you get an increasing population, and when you get population you get pro duction, and the country itself is a mine of wealth, as far as agricultural and arable land is concerned.' Then, again, in reply to a question from Mr. T. Brassey: ' Is the country through which the railway would pass at all adapted for occupation by European settlers ?'—'As far as the Persian frontier and between Baghdad and Seleucia, certainly. It enjoys a magnificent climate at all times of the 3 T ear.' The following was also very important evidence with regard to the trade of the country: 787. (Sir Stafford Northcote.) 'What business ex perience have you? You say that you are engaged in business. With what portions of the trade of Baghdad are you acquainted?'—' We first opened a direct trade with the Persian Gulf. We sent sailing ships to Bus- sorah, and when we found that the Indian government no longer intended to run steamers on the Euphrates, 31 CM Isl iod we organised a company to run steamers on the Tigris as far as Baghdad, and now we have a postal subsidy from the English government to carry the mails from Bussorah to Baghdad ; and all the traffic between Bus- sorah and Baghdad, until very lately, was carried by our steamers.' 788. ' Is it an increasing trade, or a stationary trade ?' — u When we first established trade on the Euphrates, we put on one steamer, and thought that that would be sufficient. Afterwards we were obliged to put on another, and since that time the Turkish local government have put on four, and I believe that they will all have suf ficient to do.'' 789. ' Has the traffic been at all aiFected by the open ing of the Suez Canal ?'—' I think that it has been rather increased.' Sir John Macneil, in his evidence before the com mittee, explained that the reason that he had at first given a preference to the port of Suwaidiyah was, because the ascent of the hill up the Bailan Pass was so steep that, at that period, the power of the locomotive engine not being at all so well developed as it is now, the incline could not practically be overcome. Another reason was, that from the necessity of making some ex cavations, and some deep cuttings, he thought it unad- visable to take that route; and that the harbour of Suwaidiyah might be so arranged as that it would be made a very commodious fort as well as a harbour; and the Turkish government were themselves at the time anxious to lay out their own money in making that harbour. But since that time Mr. Telford Macneil ex*60 amined the Bailan Pass a second time, and from the facts which are now known as to the mode of ascending steep inclines, with very unfavourable gradients, such as one in thirteen, and one in fourteen, and one in seventeen, that is now practicable which was before con sidered totally impracticable. There was, it has been shown, much difference of opinion upon the site of the terminus on the Persian Gulf; some advocating Kurnah, at the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers ; others Bussorah (properly Basrah), or a point near to it, on the Shat el Arab—the estuary of the Euphrates and Tigris ; others Muham- mara, at the junction of the river Karun with the Shat el Arab ; and others, again. Grain or Koweit, on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf, or Bushire (properly Abu Shahir, 'father city' 1 ), on the Persian side of the same gulf. It must be premised, in discussing this particular part of the inquiry, that the mouth of the Euphrates and Tigris is, like that of most other large rivers, more or less a delta. The two rivers unite at Kurnah amid extensive marshes. Some of these marshes are permanent, others temporary, and some are the result of occasional inun dations. JThese, from peculiar circumstances, extend further to the west, on the right bank of the Euphrates, than they do to the eastwards, on the left bank of the Tigris, Between the two rivers, near their junction, is one extensive permanent marsh. The river Euphrates is in places restrained by an artificial embankment, but this sometimes gives way, entailing the inundation of61 all the country beyond, especially near Bussorali. The most extensive marshes to the east are formed by the Hawisa tributary to the Tigris. Mr. Loftus has de picted the westerly marshes in his ' Travels in Chaldaa,' &amp;c. ^The marshes of the central districts have been ^described in Res. in Assyria,' &amp;c., p. 108 et seq. These marshes, albeit not continuous, are very extensive. Mr. Lynch is not far wrong when he said in his evidence (No. 762) that he supposes there are thou sands of square miles of marsh on the lower parts of the Euphrates and Tigris. Yet Mr. Lynch, who dwells with emphasis upon the extent of these marshes, the inundations around Baghdad, and the intolerable nuisance of the Benelaum fly, goes so far as to admit that, although there are great engineering difficulties to be met with, it would be practicable to carry a line of railway by taking it right down between the two rivers on an embankment. Nothing, as before said, is impracticable. It is a mere question of expense. Such an undertaking would involve the expenditure of a vast sum of money, and that apparently needlessly. The same thing may be said with respect to Mr. Telford Macneil's project of carrying the line from Baghdad, across on the right bank of the river Tigris, down to Kurnah (No. 415), and then crossing the Euphrates 'before the junction of the two rivers' (No. 418). Kurnah consists in reality of a few Arab huts scattered around an old fort, buried in date-trees, and standing out from boundless marshy tracts. A moment's con templation of its position at any season of the year62 would satisfy the most superficial observer as to its little adaptation in a sanitary, or any other point of view, to be a terminus for a great railway. The next point advocated was Bussorah. The old city is itself, it is to be observed, situated at a short dis tance from the Shat el Arab, upon a canal, and General Chesney was careful in explaining that the terminus would be near Bussorah, ' just below Bussorah' (No. 69), where the river is very deep, and the em bankment—a long line of palm groves—solid. The advantages to be gained by selecting Bussorah are, that it would save over a hundred miles of railway to Grain or Bushire, and that the terminus would be in the Sultan's territories, which is not the case at Muham- mara or Bushire. But if the railway were prolonged to Bussorah, it would either require to be kept along the right bank of the Euphrates, with a branch to Baghdad, or if taken to Baghdad, it would have to be taken across the Euphrates again, and thence to be carried round the extensive marshes to the west de picted in Mr. Loftus's map. Sir Henry Rawlinson and Mr. Telford Macneil both advocated Grain, or Koweit, as a terminus for the Euphrates Valley Railway. This is, indeed, a fine, deep, yet open and healthy bay and roadstead, with a small Arab town inhabited by a well-disposed trading community, but hot and treeless. An objection would present itself to this proposed prolongation of the line in the additional expense to be incurred, but this is represented by many as an advantage, by saving the loss of time entailed by a long sea journey. A more 1 sM c -to, on ___(j3 serious objection presents itself, in the fact that a line to Grain would, like one to Bussorah, require to be carried to the west of the Euphrates, or back again from Baghdad in that direction. In other respects there are no formidable engineering difficulties to the proposed terminus, and it would be within the Sultan's territories. Sir Henry Rawlinson (j^o. 7) preferred Grain on account of sanitary considerations, and it certainly would be infinitely preferable on that account to Kurnah, Bussorah, or Muhammara, but not to Bushire. Captain Charlewood expressed a preference for Mu- haramara as a terminus. This is, indeed, unques tionably the best port on the Shat el Arab. It is situated at the junction of the river Karun, the banks are tolerably high, and when not occupied by huts, houses, or forts, are clad with date-trees. Unfor tunately the occupation of this spot, so favoured by nature, has long been a bone of contention between the Turkish and Persian governments. (Fontanier's 'Egypt, India, and the Persian Gulf.') And to under stand how easily it could be made defensible, it merely requires to peruse Captain Hunt's account of Outram and Havelock's Persian campaign, when the place was assaulted by a British force. Muhammara is situated in other respects in a marshy spot, and cannot be considered as favourable to settle ment by Europeans, or as a healthy place; but Captain Charlewood is perfectly right in saying (No. 630) that a railway could be carried there by passing to the eastward of the marshes. The ground rises to the east-64 ward almost immediately beyond Muhammara, going up the Karun, but the railway would have to pass still further eastward, in proceeding to the north, to turn the marshes of Hawisa. The reason why Muhammara was not previously suggested, was because it was a Persian port, and any firman of concession made by the Turkish government would have to be completed by the government of the Shah, making in fact two different treaties of it. The Persian government has, however, shown itself of late so anxious to have the benefits brought about by railway communication in troduced into their country, that probably no great difficulties would be met with in coming to an under standing upon this point. There can be no question, however, that if the line is to include any portion of Persian territory, the best terminus would be Bushire, on the Persian Gulf, as proposed by Mr. Lynch and Sir John Macneil. In the first place, the line would not have to return from Baghdad to the Euphrates. In the second, from Baghdad to Bushire by Susiana, no marshes have to be encountered. The ground is, for the most part, level and firm. There would be some rivers to cross—a mere matter of expense—but, on the other hand, the line would be carried through one of the most fertile provinces of Persia, and one of the most ancient centres of population and civilisation in the country— Disful and Shuster still uphold, with a rather sleepy dignity, the importance of what was once u Shush an the palace,' and of Susa which lay by Clioaspes' amber stream, Tlie drink of none but kinirs.'Slii® i 65 The plains once dotted by fire-temples, the wealth of which tempted the rapacity of the Macedonian kings exist, and are still in part populated and cultivated, and, with the exception of occasional barren tracts villages, water, and cultivation arc met with all the way by Bebehan to Bushire. Bushire is also as frood a port as Grain, nor would the expenses of making a landing jetty be greater than elsewhere (except, per haps, at Muhammara, where the goods could be landed on a wooden quay), the town is civilised and accus tomed to Europeans, and as the port of Shiraz to European commerce. Above all, were it ever deemed possible to carry on the line by the littoral to Kurrachi, Bushire would be so much gain on the direct road. A letter has been recently printed by Mr. Edwyn S. Dawes, written at the desire of his Excellency Moshin Khan, advocating a line of railway from Muhammara by the Karun to Shuster, and thence to Ispahan and Teheran, or to begin with light-draughted river steamers as far as Shuster. The only objection to the latter is the existence of rocks and a bund or dam at Ahwaz, of which there is a good drawing in Captain Hunt's little book. The Euphrates steamer could not get over this obstacle; Captain Campbell succeeded in carrying a steamer over at an after period, but it could not be expected to be available at all seasons of the year. But if the Euphrates Valley Railway was prolonged from Baghdad to Bushire by Disful and Shuster, such a railway would answer all the purposes at first sought for by the Persian government. It would open the whole of the Persian provinces of Khuzistan, Luristan,66 and Arabistan, with a Persian port on the gulf at Bushire, and with Baghdad and Europe by the railway. As to a future prolongation to Ispahan, it is easier put on paper than carried into execution. Mesopo tamia is, as is well known to travellers, separated from the Persian uplands by a chain of mountains of most difficult access. This is a question that demands a great deal of study before a definite opinion can be arrived at. Baron de Bode, in his ' Travels in Luristan and Arabistan,' described several roads till then un known ; one by the so-called ' Solomon's cleft,' which he supposed to be the ' Ladder-road'' of Diodorus Siculus, and which leads from Shuster by Kumisheh to Ispahan. A line from Ispahan to Shiraz would also lead by Kumisheh, and whether the line from Bushire to Shiraz (a geological section of which is in the ''Res. in Assyria,' &amp;c.) includes the Klimakes of Alexander's historians or not, it seems very probable that, considering the friable nature of the rocks, the little elevation of the rock terraces, and the possibility of doubling them in places by following the more devious course of transverse valleys, or tunnelling where precipitous, that a branch line from Bushire to Shiraz will eventually prove to be the most feasible, and to best serve the interests of Persia, by opening a highway to Central Persia.* Mr. Dawes, it is to be observed, does not advocate an * As such a line would also leave the main trunk line at the head of the Dushistan, or low level littoral plain, somewhere near Dalaki, a considerable saving would be effected in the distance between Bushire and Shiraz.wswm aamam 67 expensive railway, whereby to open Persia to inter communication and commerce, but rather a light line of railway, say of three feet gauge, as in the case of the Great American Pacific Railway, and such a railway it might be added, ought surely to sutfice for the Euphrates Valley route also. There seems, however, to be some difference of opinion among the engineers as to the gauge of the proposed railway. Sir John Macneil advocated a gauge of three feet; Mr. Telford Macneil one of four feet eight inches, or four feet eight and a half inches; and Mr. John Maxwell an Indian gauge of five feet six inches. The question involves the matter of speed and expense. As great a speed, consistent with safety, cannot be got out of a narrow gauge as out of a wide one. But, while a three feet gauge could be con structed to the Persian Gulf for about 6,500,000/., including five per cent, to pay shareholders' interest for their money during the progress of the works, it would cost 8,100,000/. by a four feet eight or eight and a half inch gauge, an d400,000/. more by a five feet six inch gauge. Sir John Macneil's description of the kind of car riages he would construct for the transit from the Medi terranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, reads like an extract from the 'Arabian Nights' Entertainments.' With the three feet gauge/ said this eminent engineer, ' the carriages would be so low, the wheels not exceeding eighteen or twenty inches, that no platforms would be required, and no steps to the carriages, or anything of68 that kind ; the carriages would be quite available from the ground; there would be only nine or ten inches, and they would be so convenient for travelling in the way in which I propose to make them, that the pas sengers would probably sit at the side as they do in the common omnibuses of London, but with a much wider passage between them, perhaps more than double the width which there is in the London omnibuses. Then the carriages might be of considerable length, resting at each end on bogie platforms, so that there would be no bumping or jolting against the sides, or anything of that kind; they would be perfectly smooth, and having a passage right through, as they have on some of the Austrian railways, a passenger could walk from end to end of the train, and could get refreshment at night without going into the station, and the carriages could be constructed so as to be made almost uniform and perfect as to temperature.' Elsewhere, alluding to carriages for troops, Sir John Macneil said he would have them so constructed that the troops ' could get into their places with their knapsacks and their rifles, and might in five minutes be accommodated, so as to jump up on the carriage and be quite secure and safe.' He would also propose to have the carriages 'so that they would be perfectly ventilated; they would be uni- orm in temperature night and day, and in warm and cold weather just the same; there would be no difficulty or expense in doing it.' (Answ. 840.) It is obvious that with such a line of railway we should have, in addition to the local traffic and the69 transit service, no end of adventurous tourists wending their way to the far East, besides persons of a specu lative turn of mind, who would wish to have ocular tes timony of the advantages of the country for agriculture, settlement, or even building purposes. We should not only have Cooks excursions to the ruins of Babylon and the City of the Khalifs, but we should also have charming villas springing up at Antioch, at Balis, at Rakkah, at Zenobia, at Anah, and at other choice spots. Mr, Telford Macneil and Mr. John Maxwell have un questionably been guided in their opposition to this scheme by high conscientious motives, more particularly in regard to speed and safety; but it is also possible that they may have been a great deal influenced by considerations connected with the difficulties which they placed in their own way at starting, by selecting a line with a mountain pass over two thousand feet in eleva tion. If a line of railway such as Sir John Macneil proposes could be carried along the valley of Antioch to the Persian Gulf at an expense of some 6,500,000/., including five per cent, to pay shareholders' interest on their money during the progress of the works, the scheme recommends itself to the money market upon its own and sole merits. But a government cannot be said to be alive to the true interests of the British empire that would spend over eight millions in order to rescue a few British prisoners and humble a half- civilised Abyssinian potentate, and yet decline to do something in aid of a project to unite Great Britain70 with its Indian possessions. A war also involving vast expenditure and great loss of life was inaugurated simply to prevent Russia encroaching upon Turkey; yet is it difficult to get those in authority to counte nance a peaceful project, which would do more than the Crimean war ever did to give security to our Indian empire, would facilitate commerce and communication, add to the welfare and prosperity of the two countries, and open other regions to a participation in the advan tages of civilisation and well-being.

ELLIS, Re-printed by Permission of the Council. EXETEE: HENilY S. ELAND, HIGH STREET. LONDON : BELL &amp; DALDY. PRICE BJXFENQE, / A i L&gt;TO THE lEMG-IEET ZEJOInTOT?. A 'P TjTT! SIR STAFFORD H. KORTIICOTE, BART., C,B., M.P., (fee., (fee. President of the Exeter Chamber of Commerce. Sir, As almost everyone is now inquiring, What is a Light Railway ? I have, with the consent of the Council, re-printed the Paper which I had the honor to read before the Exeter Chamber of Commerce a few months since, as also the observa tions I made on the same subject at the Annual Meeting. To elucidate the subject still further, I have added thereto the Clauses of the Act of Parliament which provides for the construction and working of Light Railways. ■NBelieving firmly in the great value of railway communication to tlie agricultural and trading interests, and consequently to the Landowners by the improved value of their Instates, I am most desirous to see a good and cheap but efficient system adopted in this and the adjoining counties; and believing also that Light Railways of the National Gauge are decidedly preferable to tbose of any other gauge, I submit the example of the Duke of Bucking ham's Railway to the public, in the hope and ex pectation tbat landowners will assist in the construc tion of siuiilar lines if they do not construct them for themselves. In addressing a statesman who filled the office of Secretary of State for India during the considera tion of the proposed railway extensions in that vast country, I feel that I am addressing one who is well acquainted with this important subject, and that I am highly honored by bis kind permission to dedicate to him this Reprint. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, HENRY S. ELLIS. Fair Park, Magdalen Road Exeter, 1st Nov., 1872.ammm EXETER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. A meeting of this Chamber was held on June 18, 1872, at the Guildhall, Mr. Aylmer Porter (Vice-president) in the chair. The Chairman said the meeting had been con vened for the purpose of eliciting from Mr. Ellis some information on the subject of Light Railways, which they had felt in that Chamber was a subject of very great importance to this county. Considering the great extent of the county and the large popula tion which was scattered about in different parts of it, they felt, more especially in this city, that the ordinary system of railways was not altogether adapted to meet their wants—(hear, hear)—inas much as the expenses attendant thereon were more than they could very well hope to induce share holders to invest. Under these circumstances it became desirable to ascertain whether, by the intro duction of a much cheaper form of railway, they might not be able to get their wants supplied. They -considered these would be more readily met by the particular class of railway with which Mr. Ellis had become acquainted, and which was in operation inone of the Midland Comities. He had been kind enough to go into this question, and would now give them the result of his experience, and by his aid they might ultimately succeed in getting greater means of accommodation for Exeter that now existed. If, for instance, Chagford, Moretonhampstead, and other important and largely populated places could be brought into more direct communication with Exeter, they felt that the result would be beneficial to the city. Exeter had not the amount of railway accommodation which, from her central position and large population, she had a right to expect^ and it was to the system of Light Railways that they must look to supply the deficiency. (Applause.) Mr. H. S. Ellis then read the following paper on LIGHT RAILWAYS. Since the annual meeting of the Exeter Chamber of Commerce, when, at your invitation, I had the honor of describing the Light Railway recently constructed by the Duke of Buckingham, I have been asked by several landowners, engineers, and others interested in the construction of Cheap Rail ways, to furnish them with a fuller description of it. I gladly avail myself, therefore, of your invitation to bring the subject of Light Railways again before the Chamber. I firmly believe that the attention which you are directing to the subject will lead to a f-jnaic followingpajifli 'tie Exeter Qite nvitation, I kil t Eailway rdf JucMngliaiD, I ta ners, engiBeer^il iction of Ctop^' Her descriptioiofi e) of your in^ ailways again ^ e tliat the attai ubject ce ' ail ^yliisail wtbtnoffeastei ^onkmpsteaii^ ^places coil iominuiiicatioEii would be teBeiai ! amount of raiii central positioii jil lit to expect, aili ways ttattheyi® [Applause,) 7 greater use of sucli Railways in this part of the Kingdom, where thin population and agricultural produce scarcely justify the construction of expensive extensions of the usual Parliamentary description. The value of Light Railways and Tramways in agri cultural districts cannot well be over-estimated, as, from tlie absence of cheap transit, manure, lime, &amp;c , are almost at prohibitory prices. Farmers in the neighbourhood of Northmolton have to pay the sum of lialf-a -crown a bushel for lime, and at Hemyock the inhabitants pay no less than 5s. per ton for the cartage of coal. Within the last few weeks I have met several landowners in Devonshire who have ex pressed their willingness to give their land for the construction of Light Railways in their respective districts; and I have reason to know that engineers have already been called in to survey the country and give estimates for the construction of such lines. But the question now arises. Which kind of Light Railway should be constructed ? There are at present three different kinds which are attracting public attention;— 1st: Light Railways which follow as nearly as possible the surface of Lhe ground, avoiding the hills and the necessities for expensive over or under bridges, and, by travelling at low speeds, avoiding the construction of expensive signal and other apparatus, usually required by the Board of Trade8 for ordinary Lines. The gauge is usually the na tional one, viz., 4ft. 8^ inches. 2nd: The Patent Narrow Gauge Railway, in vented by Mr. Fell, which, by being constructed on timber supports of different heights, to suit the un dulations of the country, avoids to a great extent severance of land and expensive cutt igs and banks. The gauge of such lines varies from 8 inches to 2 feet. A railway of this description about a mile in length has been recently constructed at Aldershot in 45 days, for the purpose of conveying stores to the Victualling Office. The gauge of this line is only 18 inches, but it is capable of conveying siege guns seven tons in weight. The cost, I believe, is about £2,000 per mile. 3rd: The Wire Tramway, which, like the Fell system, is mounted on iron or timber supports, to suit the undulations of the country; but is only adapted for the conveyance of loads not exceeding 10 cwt., and is generally employed for short distances only—250 yards to three or four miles. One has been constructed as long as 15 miles. There is one at the Devonshire Clay Works 250 yards in length, and another at Brendon Hills three-quarters of a mile in length. I have lately had an opportunity of personally inspecting all three different kinds of railways, andeach lias good points to recommend it; but I am satisfied that a Light Railway of the first kind, similar to tlie Duke of Buckingham's, is the most advantage ous where it is practicable, and especially so where passenger traffic may be reasonably expected. I have had the honour to receive from the Duke himself the following very full and valuable statement with regard to the cost of His Grace's railway, as also the receipts and the working expenses, which, by his most cour teous permission, I am enabled to lay before you. The cost of the Wotton Railway, including siding and two goods sheds (one 25 feet by 25 feet, and one 60 feet by 25 feet) is rather less than £1,400 per mile, exclusive of the value of the land. The main line is very nearly 7 miles long. The land belongs principally to the Duke of Buckingham. The gradients from Quainton to Wotton are favour able, two short inclines of about 1 in 78 in opposite directions being the worst, and the general inclination being downwards to Wotton, which is 50 feet below Quainton. The gradients from Wottoii to Brill are heavy—the ascent being (with one exception, of not quite a quarter of a milej continuous for 2| miles varying from 1 in 100 to 1 in 51. The latter is a quarter of a mile; but an incline of 1 in G4 on a curve of 12 chains radius for a quarter of a mile, is quite equal to the steeper gradient. The total ascent is about 130 feet in this portion of 2-} miles.

The working of the line is carried on by do throng, Messrs. Chaplin and Home ; the maintenance by He earnings the Duke of Buckingham. On the opening of the line to Wotton (4 miles) in April, 1870, eight men were appointed in two gangs to its maintenance, the Duke having also in charge a new public road of f mile, which (although not a part of the work) was diverted at the same time as the tramway was formed. As the line became consolidated the duties of the men were extended, and since October nine men and a foreman liave been employed in the maintenance, who have, however, also had ample time to assist in ballasting the branch line, in forming sidings, &amp;c. It is proposed to continue the employment of this number through this season, as there are many little matters which during the first season will want extra atten tion, but judging from the time sheets of the last CTt three months, which have been unfavourable months for new work, it is considered that three gangs of two men each, with the foreman, will afterwards suffice.

The estimated working ex penses for the current year are £650, including 10 per cent, interest on two engines. The traffic receipts for 10 months, March to December, were over £1,000, but these do not afford very certain data, as they in clude a large amount of material for construction, and there were no through rates with other lines until July. The earnings for this year are estimated at about £1,350 or £1,400. The actual earnings to April 1st (three months)— Goods and minerals ... ... £244 Coaching traffic ... ... 50 Total £294 Brill station, however, was not open for anything but coal, road metal, &amp;c. The traffic consists of coal, road metal, manure from London, and general goods in wards; of hay, straw, grain, timber bark, outwards; of cattle inwards from Herefordshire in spring, and fat cattle to London in winter. The analysis of March traffic gives :— Carted. Not Carted. Tons. Cwt. Local or ') Rebooked J Foreign ... 24 Tons. Cwt. 25 91 14 Coals &amp; Mineral Class including Manure. Tons.

The line is worked by one six- horse Aveliug and Porter engine, assisted by one horse for shunting. The engine making two double trips daily, and a third if required except on Thurs days, when only the morning trip is made, and the engine is cleaned^ washed out, &amp;c., the horse taking a light covered truck for the milk cans in the evening from Wotton to Quainton. A second engine of the same size is being built. The power is found to be amply sufficient ; the rates are low upon agricultural produce, minerals, &amp;c. London manure is brought at Id. per ton per mile throughout. 500 or 600 tons of chalk have also been brought for manuring arable clay land. The estimated working expenses by Messrs. Chaplin and Horne are based on the assump • lion that three regular double trips are made daily, and four on two days a week, which arrangement was to come into force in June, as soon as the second engine was received, so that by alternate working of the engines, time now occupied in cleaning, See., will be saved. It should be mentioned also that the earnings of the tramway are diminished by the objec tion of the local Company intervening between the Tramway and the London and North Western and Great Western Companies.—the Aylesbury and Buckingham Company declining to accept mileage divisions or to be parties to through rates.

The rails were supplied from South Wales to a special drawing, and guaranteed against crushing, &amp;c., for three years; only six have shewn any sign of failure, all of which shewed defects within the first six weeks, and only three have been actually taken out of the line. The speed is neces sarily. from the circumstances of the line, frequent stoppages and the power of engines, very low. Time allowed from Brill to Quainton, including stoppages, one hour and five minutes. The actual ranniug speed varies from four to eight miles per hour. It was not intended to carry passengers, except persons with cattle, &amp;c., and the workmen on the estate; but so many have sought to avail themselves of the accommodation, that the passenger carriage was borrowed, and put on in January, since which the numbers carried have been:—104 in January; 123 in February ; 176 in March ; 224 in April, ihe populations of the villages accommodated are:—• Westcott, about 150 ; Ashendon, about 300 ; Wotton, about 220 ; Dorton, about 180 ; Brill, about 1,400. No contractors were employed, except for a short time for laying the rails. The heavy portion of the earthwork was done in the winter, when labour was cheap and plenty. The ballast was costly, having to be brought14 from Buckingham, over the London and North Western and the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway Companies' lines. The gauge of the line is 4ft. 8|in. and the engineers are Messrs. Lawford and Haughton, 1, Westminster Chambers, Victoria-street, London. I notice with pleasure that the Council of the Chamber drew the attention of the members in its last annual report to the present state of the law with reference to railways, and to the advantage of still greater facilities being given by the Legislature for the construction of Railways at a moderate cost. I trust at no distant day the Exeter Chamber, through the Associated Chambers, will have an opportunity of enforcing its opinion on Parliament I venture to submit that in addition to the suggestion of the Council,—' that powers should be obtained, where the majority of landowners is considerable, to bind the whole so that the holder of a small portion of lands may not obstruct the improvement of a whole district;' it is most important that the Trustees of Estates, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and Charity Trustees, should have the power either to give the land through which the Railway passes, or be re quired to grant rent charges in perpetuity at a nominal sum, when evidence is clear that the con struction of the projected Railway will improve the estate beyond the value of the land required. i US iffi lenti15 The Paper was illustrated by numerous drawings of the various systems of railways mentioned. Mr. Richards said tliey ought to be very much obliged to Mr. Ellis for bringing such an interesting matter before the Chamber, and, through the Chamber, to the public. They were rather peculiarly situated in Devonshire, because they had no large manufactories and not a large amount of money engaged in business, which had often been an inducement to those enterprises. Persons in the West were inclined to follow in the beaten track of their forefathers, and not as a rule to go out of the routine of ordinary life. In the construction of railways, upon whatever scheme, some persons must unite to carry out that which one individual would be unable to perform, and if they could introduce into Devonshire railways of such a form where the construction would be cheap and the advantages numerous, they would be more likely to awaken interest and to gain the assistance of those who would readily invest their money elsewhere, but were rather slow to invest it in their immediate neighbourhood. The vitality of a neighbourhood depended to a great extent upon the facilities for communication. And not only were increased facilities for communication necessary for business purposes in this county, which gloried in being one of the finest counties in the world, but it might also hold out another inducement to many of their fellow- countrymen to come down to the fair West and see something besides mere 'bricks and mortar.' (Hear, and laughter.) He believed increased railway communication would be the means of bringing a larger number of persons into this county, and therefore a larger amount of wealth. He need hardly tell them that people coming from Lancashire did not come with empty pockets, and they often found that persons, struck with the beauty of the county, were in duced to become residents in it. Let them take Chagford, Moreton, Okehampton, and the fringe of the Dart; they could scarcely find in any other part of the kingdom such a combination of attractions as was there to be found. Under the circumstances he thought they J Council of tk 1 members in its state of dieki lie advantage of r tlie Legislate a moderate cost, !liamber,tlirougl e an opportiitj at I venture to luggestion of tie ) obtained, wlffl siderable, toW small portk of ementofa# t tbe Trustees ol oners, and W | either to give ^ ^ passes, or be fc - i perpetuity at s ear that tlie con w ill improve tk 1 required.16 were deeply indebted to the gentleman who had given them the paper for bringing before the Chamber so important a subject in so clear and lucid a manner. (Hear, hear.) Mr. J. S. U pcott (Cullompton) fully endorsed Mr. Richards's remarks as regarded the importance of increased railway communi cation. He expressed a hope that landowners throughout the king dom would readily take up a matter of this kind, which, whilst it greatly greatly affected their own interests, must benefit their poorer neighbours. As an outsider, he begged to offer his thanks to Mr. Ellis for so ably placing before the meeting what must be deemed a matter of very great importance. Mr. A rthur C. P ain observed that in a portion of the Paper Mr. Ellis had referred to the position of the Trustees and the Ecclesiasti cal Commissioners in reference to this matter. He found that in some parts of the county there had been considerable difficulty with reference to the purchase of land for railways, but a short time ago he had occasion to go before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who told him they were willing to meet the promoters of railways in every possible way. Of course they could hardly be expected to give the land, but he believed they were willing to dispose of it at a fair agri cultural price. With regard to two systems of Light Railways men tioned in the Paper—the Fell system and the Wire Rope—he thought there were disadvantages connected with both. The life of a rope was calculated at two years. He believed a light line, following as near as possible the surface of the land, was about the most inexpensive that could be constructed. In 1864 an Act was passed to facilitate the construction of railways, but they were obliged to get the consent of all the landowners before they could proceed. This, he felt convinced, was a great stumbling-block, and considerably impeded their progress. (Hear, hear.) He had no desire to infringe on the right of property, but he did think that if they could obtain the sanction of the owners of two-thirds of the quantity of land required they should be able to compel the owners of the remaining portion to give way. It couldmswmmmmmmmmm 17 not be denied that there was a growing desire for Light Railways, and he believed the day would come when there would be a ramifi cation of lines, not only to towns and cities with large populations, but also to smaller places where the population was as low as 500. (Applause.) Mr. Chillingworth laid before the meeting drawings of the ' single suspended rail' system, his own invention, which he said had been adopted in some parts of the country at a comparatively trifling expenditure. Mr. Pain said Mr. Fell had recently informed him that he had tried the single suspended rail system, but found that it was not so advantageous as those referred to in the paper. The Chairman said the object they had in view was not to bring forward any particular plan, but to enable landowners in every part to adopt that which they considered most suitable to the locality in which they resided. He should like to see the country filled with a net-work of railway, Mr. Pain thought the financial difficulty was the chief one they would have to overcome. Mr. Ellis said he was conversing recently with a gentleman, who expressed his willingness to give land provided a railway could be brought into the neighbourhood; but on seeing the same gen tleman a few days afterwards, he said that, notwithstanding the great improvement the railway would be to the estate, he found on consulting his lawyer that, being simply a trustee, he had no power to carry out his promise. The promoters of the Totnes and Buck- fastleigh Railway had had to pay a very large sum—amounting to several thousand pounds—to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, for the land required, although the railway will benefit their large estates in that neighbourhood to a vast extent. The Railway Company had so much difficulty in paying for it that the construction of the line18 was delayed for several years. These simple facts shew the impor tance of some alteration being made in the law, so far as respects the power of trustees; and if the Chamber could bring about some alteration in this matter, it would be doing a great good, (Hear, hear.) Mr. C otton thought the question as to which was the best plan that could be adopted was one for future decision, but he believed they were all agreed that some system of light railways would be of exceeding importance to the city. However important the tourist traffic, which had been touched upon by Mr. Richards, might seem, he thought there was one vital point which called for consideration. Already a movement had been set on foot to divert some of the trade out of the city, aiid he thought a system of light railways might be the means of counteracting it. He proposed the following resolu tion :—' This meeting requests that the attention of the Council of the Exeter Chamber of Commerce will be directed to the great im portance of a system of Light Railways to Exeter and the neighbour hood, with a view to awaking public opinion on the subject, and, if possible, to encourage and promote some definite scheme.' This was seconded by Mr. R owe , and carried unanimously; and a cordial vote of thanks having been accorded to Mr. Ellis for his in teresting Paper, the meeting separated.19 LIGHT RAILWAY'S. Railway News, 25^ May, 1872. At the annual meeting of the Exeter Chamber of Commerce on Friday, May 17, 1872, the President, the Bight Hon. Sir Stafford H. Nortlicote, Bart., in the chair, Mr. H. S. Ellis made some prac tical observations with reference to the subject of light railways. From Ms position as a director of the Bristol and Exeter Bailway, and being intimately conversant with railway matters, Mr. Ellis's observations are worth recording, and we give them, more especially as they show the great usefulness short lines of this description will be in some of the thinly populated districts of Devonshire, He remarked that he had recently paid a visit to such a line in Bucking hamshire, constructed on the Duke of Buckingham's property. The line runs from the Quainton Boad Station of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway to within a mile of the village of Brill—with a branch to Wotton —in all about seven miles. The line passes through a rich agricultural country, and presents no engineering difficulties whatever, there being no under or over bridges, and no banks or cuts of importance. The roads are all crossed on a level. The water courses and surface water are carried under the line by agricultural or glazed stoneware pipes, brick culverts being used in one or two places only. The line having been originally intended for a horse tramway, the rails are laid on longtitudinal sleepers six inches square, with transoms and iron ties twelve feet apart. The rails weigh 301bs. per yard, and are of the bridge section form. They are secured to the sleeper by fang-bolts. The cost per mile was about £1,400, exclusive of land. Where the line runs through arable land it is not fenced, but through pasture land it is, with post and rails as ordinarily used on railways. The width of land taken is about 19 feet. The engine is watered from neighbour ing ponds. The line has been open for goods traffic about twelve months. There are no stations, but at each main road crossing there is a siding for trucks, The platforms are simply banks of earth re-20 tained by sods. The gates shut across the railway, but appear to be little used. They are ordinary field gates. The gradients are gene rally easy, the steepest being 1 in 51, and that only for a short distance. The engine at present in use is one of Aveling and Porter's traction engines, which cost about £400, and weighs in working trim under ten tons. This engine takes up the before- mentioned incline oads of 37 tons at the rate of four miles per hour, but an engine of greater power and higher speed is about to be used. There are two trains a day in each direction. The trains avarage about five trucks each—recently a passenger carriage (G.W.R., 4ft. 8^in. gauge) has been added, and runs in the goods trains. The village of Brill contains about 1,500, and the village of Wotton 100. The line is worked by Messrs. Chaplin and Home, and it is said to return per cent, profit on the outlay. Messrs. Chaplin and Home's offices are at Brill, where there is a manager and two clerks, and there are employed on the line one stoker (engine driver), one breaksman and one guard. There are also ten perma nent waymen, but whether they were employed by the Duke of Buckingham or by Messrs. Chaplin was unexplained. The principal traffic is in coal—about twenty trucks of from five to seven tons a week. The remainder of the traffic is such as is usual in agricultural districts—manure, hay, casks of ale, &amp;c. He was informed that the goods rates were about 4d. per cwt. to Brill, and that the pas senger fares were as follows :—To Westcott, 3d. each way ; Wotton, (Id. ditto ; Brill, Is. ditto. The guard issued the tickets whilst travelling in the train, the tickets being torn from a book as in the tramway carriages. At Wadsdon Road, about 1^ miles from Quainton Road, a farmer (who had a siding from the railway) had a coal store. A down train at Quainton Road, on arrival there at about half-past eight o'clock in the morning of May 11th, 1(S72, consisted of an engine, a Great Western Railway carriage, five empty coal trucks, and three trucks laden with hay, which altogether w r eighed about 50 tons. All along the railway there was evidence of much business being carried on in manure, large heaps lying in the fields close to the fence, and single trucks being drawn by a horse for unloading in convenient places. 111105 OF 31 W3 2 ' SET m of Trade maj ffipplying for it to siligk Railway, tl mitt tk Company 1 iiMway shall \ si tt conditions and ■S' Iran time to lime trtjulatioas respect vehicles ! a greater 1 sila by 01 ^f^pecting the ''WifiHe* Mm v v; 4- no 72 )REGULATIOA 1 of railways act, 31 and 32 Victories, LIO-HZT 1 IR^ILW.A.IZ-S. 27—The Board of Trade may, by license, authorise a Company applying for it to construct and work, or to work as a Light Railway, the whole or any part of a Kailway which the Company has power to construct or work. 8—A Light Railway shall be constructed and worked subject to such conditions and regulations as the Board of Trade may from time to time impose or make; provided that (I) the regulations respecting the weight of locomotive engines, carriages, and vehicles, to be used on such railway, shall not authorize a greater weight than eight tons to be brought upon the rails by one pair of wheels; (2) the regulations respecting the speed of trains shall not authorize a rate of speed exceeding at any time twenty- five miles an hour.
