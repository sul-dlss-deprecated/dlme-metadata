The letter therefore explains the Resident's dilemma with how to proceed.It conveys a suggestion from the Resident that acts committed prior to the signing of the General Treaty should be given amnesty, due to the difficulty in resolving them, and the likelihood that pursuing them could risk the peace of the Persian Gulf. It also recommends that the tribes of the Persian coast should be warned against provoking the Jawassmees [Qawāsim] by attempting to retake property taken from them prior to the establishment of the treaty's provisions.Enclosed with the letter is the substance of a communication sent by the Resident to the Shaikh of Congoon, enquiring into the matter, and suggesting that he reaches a compromise with Sooltan bin Suggur.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x000023#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
