Bated, 18th J/Thany,1347 MEMQRANBUM With reference to your memorandum No. 765 of 10th Novr. 1928. According to the wishes of H. E. Shaikh Hamad I have discussed the subject of your letter with various leading persons in the pearl industry. They are unanimous in considering that if your suggestion was enforced it would cause very serious harm to the diving community in Bahrain. The following are their arguments. 1. On the mainland most of the diving is ^ done on the Khamami* system by v/hich divers debts are settled up at the end of each season. In Bahrain the Selafieh system is the one most adopted and in this system divers debts are carried on from year to year. Therefore your suggestion would be a onesided one as most of the Bahrain divers are indebted to Nakhudas while most of the mainland divers are not indebted to their nakhudas. 2. Few divers come to Bahrain from Katfrar and -^ubai. 3. Katfiar used to belong to Bahrain. So how can the Ruler of KatfcTar claim that the laws in Kattfar are older than those of Bahrain? they are not. Contd.4. Bahrain is the centre of the pearl industry and should have the right to lay down the law on the subject. 5. Shaikh Jasim has not much interest in diving. 6. If your suggestions were adopted a mainland Nakhuda could steal the divers of Bahrain Nakhudas and he would not be held responsible, assuming that he would pretend not to know that they were indebted, but if a Bahrain Nakhuda did exactly the same thing he would be punished, 7. Divers would run away from Bahrain, when they owed a lot of money and do a season or two on the mainland unaer a mainland Nakhuda, and the Bahrain Nakhuda would have no redress. H, E. Shaikh Hamad is inclined to agree with the arguments against your proposal, but he suggested that perhaps you yourself could send for some of the big pearl men in Bahrain, Bahrain sub jects, and hear their tfiews. Personally I agree with the Bahrain argument and I think that there would be an outcry against the proposed change. Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.© N« . 15 1 tf 1928. Political Agtncy, Bahrain.

As the Qatar Salifa a allows Qatar subjects successfully plead the law ef maghtur when sued by Bahrain subjects, se sheuld the Bahrain Diving Ceurt be directed te accept the law ef maghtur when Bahrain subjects are sued by Qataris. Dees this prepesal command itself te His Excellency ShaiKh Hamad? 2. Is there any reasen why Bahrain sheuld net acce$i the Kirtgnamis system, which appears te be fair rather than the Salafieh system which tends te keep divers permanently indebted te the Hakhudas? What are the arguments in faveur ef the Salafieh? 5. Why is it that few divers come te Bahrain from Qatar, although Bahrain is the centjtt. ef the pearl industry? Is it because the Khammas system is fairer than the Salafieh, under which a diver cannot remain a free man?

I will reply to your memo after discussion with H. 'E. Shaikh Haoad and persons interested in the mathr. May I make a suggestion that might possibly be a satisfactory solution? if the Rulers of Bahrain and Kattar agreed that none of their Dakhudas in their res pective territories would ever engage any diver from the other territory unless the diver held a 'Barua'. Such an arrange ment would be welcome in Bahrain and I think it would be a fair one. Would it not answer all purposes Adviser to the Government, Bahrain /HO. ?/?/ — Of 1347 Office of/the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Bated, Ihth Shahban 1347 To ■?/ U-.-rj H. B. M's Political A^ent, Bahrain. Sir, of 21-12-28, H. If. Shaikh Hamad asked me again to discuss the matter with one or two leading persons in the pearl trade. I dis cussed it with Mohorned bin Rashid bin Hindi, Ali bin Seggar, Abdu Ali, Khalifa bu Ghais, and Abdurrehman Zisni* I myself would suggest that Shaikh Hamad be asked to hold a mejlis of say twenty leading persons in the pearl trade which perhaps you would care to attend your self and hear the arguments. Shaikh Hamd considers that the matter affects those in the pearl trade only so he has left the decision to therp. Regarding your questions; the following is the opinion of the persons named above. It would be highly detrimental to the pearl trade and to the prosperity of this State to alter the present system. Pe rsonally I do not altogether agree with this.- 2 - Certanly if the Kharnmamis system was adopted instead of the Selafieh system the whole pearl industry here would be revolutionised, but personally I believe that it would result in the divers petting fairer conditions. Such a change would be intensely unpopular among the big Pakhudas and land merchants and I think Shaikh Hamad would be very loath to act con trary to their wishes. large sums of money would be involved. Supposing, at a low estimate, that there are 10,000 Selafieh divers in Bahrain, each owing 3s. GOO/-, their total debts would be 3s. 60 lacs. This represents Capital of the land merchants sunk in the divers. By some means these mer chants would have to be compensated. It would be possible to make some arrange ment over a period of several years if all the divers were allowed to dive on the Khammamis system and no further advances were made. They could gradually pay off their debts. It is the advances that reta rd the results of the diving reforms. If these were reduced to a certain amount each season, as was the original intention, conditions would improve and after a time a large proportion of the divers would be free and could dive as Khammamis if they wished. But any reduction raises violent protest from Divers and Uakhudas, not from the merchants.. I personally am, and always have been, very interested in any attempts to improve the conditions of the Bahrain divers, but I think that to change thethe entire Selafieh system would be too drastic a measure for this Government to undertake at present unless Shaikh had such strong support from the political Agent that the support would almost amount to pressure. The divers who would benefit are an inarticulate community, incapable of protecting or oven appreciating what is to their own interests, and except the Government, nobody wishes to help them. Shaikh Hamad is the Government and he would dislike incurring the disapproval of the big men of the pearl trade to benefit the divers. 1 think myself that it would be wiser if the Government continued reducing the advances instead of attacking the whole Sela fieh system. Once the divers are free from their debts they can dive as they please. I am told that few divers come to Bahrain, from Tatar becaise they do not like having to sub mit to proper rules and regulations which pre vent them from playing about and cheating. personally I believe that Qatar divers do not come here in large numbers because they prefer the Khamamis system which is practised more in Qatarr than in Bahrain. Bin Jabara was a Shaikh of the Bin Ali tribe who went from Bahrain to °atar some 35 years ago. It is universally believed here are 'K older than those in Qatar. The Bahrain merchants say that the Selafieh system is practised here because there are more wealthy-4- wealthy who can aflord to finance pearling dhows, ^ z*' whereas in Qatar there are only a very few really big men. The Bahr in merchants say that it is notorious that no justice can be obtained by them in pearling cases taken in Qatar. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour Obedient Servant, adviser to the Government, Bahrain.
