The letter in these two folios is sent from the Muscat Political Agent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf concerning the landing grounds at Masirah, Murbat and Bait Al-Falaj. It is most likely that there are missing folios in the file dated between 1929 and 1933.The main correspondents in the file are: Headquarters British Forces, Iraq; the Political Agency, Muscat; and the Political Residency, Bushire.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Bait al-Falaj</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Air force</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Masirah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airfields</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0002ea#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0002ea#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0002ea#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
