Monsieur le Ministre, With reference to Mr. Butler’s note Ho.b26 (516/11/36) of October 1st 1936, I have the honour to state that the indisputable rights of my Government in respect of Bahrein have bean set forth in detail in the note of August 2nd 1928 and the statements of Sir Austen Chamberlain contained In the note of February 19th 1929 were not found by the Imperial Government as convincing and cannot shake the legitimate rights of Iran. I avail myself of this opportunity, (Signed) B. SAMIY.COPY No.2X41/306/26. (E 'Vll/ 91 ) 1&lt; BRITISH LEGATIOIt JEDDA • 15th December, 1936. 7 J u-3 My dear Bennett, Your letter E.7034/2085/91 dated 24th November regarding Yusuf Yasin's reference to the Shaikh of Bahrain as ’’the Amir of 'the Bahrain Principalitj'-'. Calvert is certain that Yusuf Yasin used 'Amir' as the Shaikh’s title and 'Imara' (i.e. amirate) for his realm. I agree that the Government of India’s suggestion is not worth pursuing. As Loch pointed out in his D.0.No^ 751~S dated 12th October, the usage in the Gulf differs from that current here. For instance, Yusuf Yasin is always called 'Shaikh', which is used here for a townsman of consequence whom the title of Effendi or Bey does not suit. On the other hand the princes Saud and Faisal are called 'Amir' and they are royal highnesses , though it is true that they may be described as subordinate, though only to the King, their father. Amir is also used in Saudi Arabia for holders of superior administrative posts, such as the governorships of Tebuk and Jauf and Medina, and this does tend to reduce its status somewhat, even though the amirs in such cases are often relatives of Ibn Saud; but on the other hand the use of the title of amir by the Ruler of Trans-Jordan tends the other way. The fact is, what with the clash of different usages in these days when Arabic culture is tending towards unification, and the difficulty in finding in Arabic the exact equivalents for the ranks, conditions and degrees recognised by us, Arabic nomecleture is still too vague for us to draw any certain deduction from the words used by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin. /However, J.C.Sterndale Bennett Esq.,C.M.G.,M.C., Foreign Office.(it) However, it is an interesting point, and if we get any evidence to support the theory that Ibn Saud regards the Shaikh of Bahrain as being in any way subordinate to him we will let you know* I am sending copies of this letter to Powle and Loch. Yours ever, (Signed) R.W. Bullard*confidential* The Residency, Sa*ud in connection with the Shaikh of Bahrain. 2. It is true that M Ajnir M is used for Bin Sa’ud’s Governors in Hasa, Q,atif and so on, but the ruler of Najd used in former days himself to be known as the 'Wahabi Amir' (see Aitcheson’s Treaties Vol.XI, Fifth Edition, page 206) and there is now the 'Amir' •Abdullah of Transjordania. In Kuwait the term 'Amir' appears to be used as an high honorifici indeed, de Gaury has written in another connection that, if the English style 'His Highness' is introduced for the Shaikh, it may become necessary to use the Arabic style 'Amir'. I do not, however, actually remember having heard 'Amir' used to the same extent in Bahrain. 3. Though the style 'Shaikh' is reserved for the ruling families in Kuwait, Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast, on the other side of Arabia it is used merely as we should say 'Mr.' or perhaps 'Esquire'(in the modern debased usage). I happen to know that at least one of the A1 Khalifah does not like using 'Shaikh' in, for example, Egypt, as it tends to give a wrong impression of his position. 4. on the whole, therefore, I do not think that any exception need be taken to Bin Sa*ud«s use of 'Amir', but it would be well to watch that he does not use it in any context which suggests subordination. 5. In connection with the last sentence I should be interested to know what Arabic word Bin Sa*ud used for 'Principality' / .auson Esquire, ■ ~ The India office, London.■ LEAGUE OF NATIONS mmmmm Communicated to the Council and Members of the League.

(Sad.) M. J. CLAUSON(32. III III l'^ P.Z.6027/36. Mr. Waltopr. ^ v&lt;^ &lt;r T You will remember that the exchange of Notes between H.M.G. and the Saudi Government about the Bahrein Transit Dues Agreement was registered with the League of Nations. The Foreign Office insisted on this procedure on the ground that the Agreement was one between H.M.G. and a foreign power and constituted a treaty engagement under Article 18 of the Covenant of the League (see for instance Mr. Brenan*s letter of 24th January at P.Z.620/36). The Bahrein Government have already sent a protest to the League of Nations against the exchange of Notes as being an infringement of Persian sovereignty over Bahrein (P.Z.4106/36). They have now sent a similar protest to ?. 2 . the Saudi Government. Mr. Calvert*s despatch of the is l A S0th July explains the position and reports that the Saudi Government propose to reply to the Iranian Government to the effect that they have no knowledge of the rights of the Government of Iran in Bahrein^that the Saudi Government has recognised Sheikh Hamad as the Amir of Bahrein^and that the Saudi Government made their agreement with Bahrein about the transit dues ,f in consideration/(3T’ 2 . B ) consideration of the fact that its ruler is Sheikh Hamad bin Isa', The Foreign Office in their letter of the 20th August A say that the agreement can 'be correctly described as constituting an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Bahrein' and that there is no reason to object to the Saudi Government *s proposed reply merely on the ground that it does not refer to the fact of H.M.G.»s position*. 17 J /W\ ulatum The present Foreign Office letter seems hardly consistent with their attitude over the r egistration of the exchange of Notes, but perhaps we need not press this point. ye can presumably agree with the instructions which, in paragraph 3 of their letter, they propose to send to H.M.Charge d»Affaires.

I am authorised to assure your Royal Highness, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of Bahrein, that the authorities in Bahrein will not at any future time claim any duties whatsoever on goods shipped to or from ports in Saudi Arabia in ships calling at Bahrein, when the goods in question are intended to be taken direct to their destination in the ships carrying them, and not to be landed at Bahrein for re-export or trans-shipped without being landed. The permanent validity of this assurance will not be affected by any notification, which may be made in accordance with the paragraph numbered seven in my note of to-day. With highest respects, A. S.

(B 16/16/25) /I i 5 'i [&lt;&lt;0 Dear Glauson, You will remember that in your letter P.Z.15/36 of the 1st January to #ard about the Bahrain transit dues agreement you raised the question of the principle involved in registering such exchanges of notes with the League of Nations and expressed the view that we should avoid giving the impression that all exchanges, even of a comparatively unimportant nature such as that about the Bahrain transit dues, must automatically be registered with the League and published in the United Kingdom Treaty Series, 2, As you know, we agreed to make the modification which you suggested in the wording of our draft telegram to Jedda on the question of registration and publication so as to render it less categorical. We think, however, that it may be useful to explain our position clearly so as to avoid further difficulties in matters of this sort. riffooSURE IN WEEKLYETTBr''! r ■ * * M.J. Clauson, Esq. 2 /(Ian 183 5 F^d : 3 0 JAN 1936 g'.Cf... 3. ■•.*3 f ' V W I 4 / ^ w l IN U H urnCB| qpY SENT TO.. Jmm mm Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Bations obliges member States to register 'every treaty 'or international engagement' entered into. The obligation thus imposed on His Majesty's Government is absolute and the only question which arises is whether the instrument or instruments in any particular case constitute an 'international engagement' for the purpose of this Article. In the case of the Bahrain transit dues agreement, we decided that it did definitely constitute an international engagement within the meaning of Article 18 and once that point had been settled there could, of coarse, be no question of subsequently reversing the decision on account of some outside political consideration such as the attitude of the Bahrain Government. 4. Consequently the original wording in the draft telegram to Jedda which Ward enclosed in his letter B 7487/191/25 of the 31st December to you i.e., 'they lthe notes) will have to be registered with the 'League of Nations and published ' was technically correct■SULUMHBi correct. It waa not, of coarse, our intention (and I do not think that the wording of the original draft could he so interpreted) to suggest that there was an obligation to register all exchanges of notes; our obligation towards the League as pointed out above only refers to exchanges of notes ( such as those about the Bahrain transit dues) which in the opinion of our technical authorities must be held to constitute an ’’international engagement” within the meaning of Article 18 of the Covenant. 5. We have looked up the case of the hurram-Ahost exchange of notes in 1334; but we find that it in fact involved no departure from our general attitude. The case was admittedly a borderline one and although we inclined to the view that it came within Article 18 of the Covenant, we did not feel that we could register the notes against the wishes of the other party to the agreement, particularly in view of the reasons given. The hurram-khost exchange of notes, however,liov.’ever, like all others, was considered entirely on its own merits, and the fact that it was not held necessary to register it does not, of course, constitute any sort of precedent. 6. Meanwhile 1 understand from you that the Bahrain Government have no objection to the publication of all the notes about the transit dues agreement, so happily that particular question has settled itself.P indexed CONFIDENTIAL.

Paragraph 7 of agreement embodied in main note to Saudi Government provides for entry into force on date of exchange of notes, i.e. from 17th November, when exchange was completed by Saudi reply. Bahrain Government concurred in draft of notes and are therefore under obligation to conform to this provision and enforce agreement from 17th November. If through misunderstanding they have not done so hitherto, Saudi Government v/ill be entitled to claim retroactive benefit of customs concessions. Point two. As notes have been exchanged between His Majesty’s Government (on behalf of Bahrain) and Saudi Arabia and constitute treaty engagement, it is proposed that they should be registered with League of Nations and published in United Kingdom Treaty Series. His Majesty’s Government cannot there fore object to publication of notes by Saudi Government. In any case there does not seem to be anything objectionable from the Bahrain point of view in Ahmedi notes, and attempt to distinguish between them and. main notes for purposes of publica tion would only arouse suspicion of Saudi Government.

Dear Claus on, With I’eference to recent conversations over the telephone, I send you herewith:- (l)a copy of Jedda telegram No.225 of 24th December about the Bahrain transit dues agreement; (2;the draft of the reply which we would propose to send to (l). Since the draft really was written we have received your official letter P.Z.9310/1935 of 30th December, forwarding a copy of the Political Resident’s telegram No.1048 to you commenting on Jedda telegram No.225. We are disposed to think however, that it would still be desirable to telegraph to Ryan as in the draft since we owe him a direct reply to his enquiries. In any case the second and third paragraphs of our draft are not affected by Powle’s telegram. We tfOPY SENT GY AU1 MAIL — 0 bo'We suggest that you may care to support our telegram to Ryan hy instructing Fowle to take the action vis a vis the Bahrain Government which he proposes in the first paragraph of his telegram No.1048 to you. As regards the question of publication, our view (as explained in the draft telegram) is that all the notes form part of a single treaty engagement between His Majesty’s Government (on behalf of Bahrain) and the Saudi Government, that this will have to be registered with the League, and that it is neither possible nor desirable to avoid publication of the whole exchange or to discourage the Saudis from doing so themselves. When we get the original Arabic notes for which we are asking Ryan we propose to u photostat ,f them so as to make a '’line block' 1 from which to print the Arabic, with the English, texts in the Treaty Series. This will provide us with plenty of copies of the whole exchange for communication to the League, the Government of Bahrain and any other interested parties. Perhaps you would let us knowmmm i know in due course how many copies of fhis print you G'ulf - will require for yourselves and the If you feel ahle to -concur in the draft telegram I should he grateful if you could let me know by telephone as we are anxious to send off our reply to Ryan as soon as possible. j pwv* &lt;r i4J&lt;XV^In United Kin^dost Treaty trite.

The Bahrein Government had concurred in several modifications of their former terms: their undertaking regarding the non-repe tition of the 'Ahmedi' case was to continue irrespective oi the duration oi the remainder of the Agreement^ and was accordingly put in a separate Note; while the transit duty to be levied on goods 'transhipped without being landed' off Bahrein was to be only 1-f-^b ad valorem . in addition, moreover, various alterations in wording had to be made before a form of Agreement mutually accept able/acceptable was evolved. The two Notes in their final form at P.Z.5120/35) were addressed to the Saudi Arabian Government on November 16th, and replies were received on November 17th. 2. Legal confirmation to the local settlement reached in March has therefore been slow in coming. But now that it has come, the Agreement appears to be very satisfactory. Ofc/Sci/vs. tt/f.

But in view of danger referred to in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 214 (of July 25th) you may accept 'at' if Fuad Hamza raises any objec tion to this purely verbal change. The word 'transhipped' occurs, however, in four places in our two notes and to avoid cumbersome repetition best course would be to add v/ords '(that is, loaded and unloaded direct from ships into dhows and dhows into ships anchoring off Bahrein)' between 'transhipped' and 'without being landed' at end of paragraph 2 of first note.

Calvert (Jedda), Foreign Office, 31st October, 1936. 7.30 p.m. No. 124# IMPORTANT * Your telegram No. 196 (of 20th Octoberi Bahrein transit dues). Point 1. Reference to one and three quarter# per cent was based on wording of relevant passage in letter of April 7th from Bahrein Representative to Saudi Delegation (enclosed in Political Agent's despatch of 12th April) which runs 'reduction of one-eighth in the two per cent Customs duty on 'all cargo transhipped at sea M . Although our draft note has received concurrence of Sheikh of Bahrein (Political Resident’s letter of 13th August) reduction of one-eighth per oenfr was certainly intended, as stated originally in Bahrein telegram No. 67 of April 6 th. You should therefore thank Yusuf Yasin for drawing attention to this error and propose necessary amendment to paragraph 2 of first draft note. Point 2. Although agreement consists almost entirely of concessions by Bahrein provisions in paragraph 7 of draft note were made bilateral to meet Saudi susceptibilities. You should make it clear that there was never any intention (even had it been possible to do so) to attempt to bind Ssudi Government to Import all goods by ships touching at Bahrein, and that agreement embodied in draft notes could not possibly be Interpreted in this sense. If, however, Yusuf Yasin still insists upon this being confirmed in writing, you may agree to send him a separate explanatory note on this point in the termsterns contained in my immediately following telegram* You should now make every effort to complete exchange of notes before Yusuf Yasin leaves for Riyadh* Addressed to Jedda Ho* 124, repeated to Bushire Ho* 67 and Oovemaent of India Ho* 106*(1 6291/191/26) 1935 MO DI^TI;IdUTIO&gt;i.

I connnunicated draft notes regarding Bahrain officially to Minister for Foreign affairs on October 14th, On October 19th Yusuf Yasin referred to them orally in order to clear up two points before replying officially. Both points concerned longer draft Note paragraph 2 3 first points con cerned dues under numbered paragraph 2. Our draft is stated to be 1 and 5 quarters ad valorem whereas Yusuf Yasin states that at conference 1 and 7/8 ad valorem was fixed. Hamid Sulaiman and Khalid Halid confirmed this. Although latter figure was of course less favourable to Saudi Government: he drew attention to what might be an error in our draft. (In this connexion please see Bahrain telegram No.57 of .April 5th) paragraph 5 second point concerned paragraph 7. Yusuf Yasin enquired whether inclusion of Saudi Arab Govern ment in provision for reconsiderin the arrangements implied that Saudi.Arab Government are bound to import goods via Bahrain WiV.s don j■■ by agreement. If so Saudi Government could not agree. He added however from terms of (Ahmadi) draft note he judged Saudi Government were not bound and if that interpretation were correct he would propose to add to paragraph 7 following “clause: 'it being understood that Saudi .Arab Government and their subjects are free to import to..*.to the coast of Saudi urab Kingdom by way of Persian Gulf via Bahrain and its ports, or by another way'. Paragraph 4. Yusuf Yasin who drafted proposed addition in Arabic in my presence explained (as indeed is clear) that meaning was that Saudi Government and subjects were to be free to import goods through flasa ports direct without ship touching at Bahrain. He did not insert word 'direct” in his draft. Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No. 196, repeated to India telegram No.115 ?

It is quite impossible to shift their Legal Department from their rigid opposition to the phrase 'at sea' unqualified, and Sir Andrew Ayan feels fairly confident that the compromise which is now suggested is not likely to arouse ary suspicion in the minds of the Saudis. I have discussed it with Mr. Laithwaite who sees no objection to the compromise.

July 18, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4421/191/25] Record of First Part of^ Fifth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 15, 1935. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. Rendel. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Sir A. Ryan. Arabian Minister for Foreign Mr. Ward. Affairs). Mr. Malcolm. Mr. RENDEL suggested that the meeting should discuss in the first place the situation arising out of the recent conference at Bahrein to consider the question of transit dues on goods imported into the Hasa province of Saudi Arabia through the port or territorial waters of Bahrein. He recalled that the conference had reached a considerable measure of agreement, and that it had subsequently’ been agreed between Sir xA Ryan and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin at Jedda that its results should be embodied in a formal exchange of notes between His Majesty s Government and the Saudi Government. As regards the substance of the agreement there appeared to be only two points outstanding, viz. . (1) Whether the Saudi Government were prepared to give an assurance that reciprocal action would be taken by them for the issue of manifests to all vessels leaving their ports for Bahrein. (2) What should be the duration of the formal agreement embodying the results attained at the conference. Mr. Rendel did not think that there would be any difficulty over (1). but (2) was more complicated. The Government of Bahrein felt that they could not bind themselves in perpetuity for a long fixed period not to alter their transit dues, they wished to be able to regain their freedom of action in the event of the economic situation undergoing some unexpected change. In the circumstances His Majesty’s Government had suggested that the duration of the agreement might be defined by the following formula :— “ Should economic conditions in Bahrein at any time render necessary a reconsideration of these concessions the Bahrein Government will inform the Saudi Arabian Government and will not withdraw any of these concessions until six months after giving such notice.” This would mean that the agreement would run on indefinitely until six months after notice had been given to terminate its provisions; the Bahrein Government were quite prepared, if the Saudi Government wished it, to amend the foimula so as to give the Saudi Government reciprocally a similar right to hring the agreement to an end. o- a ™ xi. x Sheikh Yusuf Y^asin had, however, pointed out to Sir A. Ry an that, while the Saudi Government had no objection to the agreement not being of perpetual duration, they could not agree that any such limitation should apply to the of vessels calling at Bahrein to take cargo on direct to the Hasa coast. I hey accordingly desired that the undertaking given by the Bahrein delegates, that the Bahrein Government would not in future repeat the procedure they had adopted in the case of the steamship Ahmedi, should be made perpetual, irrespective of the duration of the rest of the agreement. The insistence of the Saudi Government on this last point had led to a temporary delay in embodying the results of the conference in a geneial agi ce ment but Mr. Rendel was now authorised to give Fuad Bey a categorical assurance, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of Bahrein, that there would in the future be no penalisation at Bahrein (as m the [456 s—1]case of the steamship Ahmedi) of vessels carrying cargo direct to the Saudi coast °.f fhe inainland. this point could be dealt with, and the above assurance connimed, m a separate note. The assurance given by the Bahrein delegates on is point would be perpetual in character, and he hoped that this would leave tne way clear for the projected exchange of notes. FUAD BFT HAMZA said that his Government would, of course, have no objection to instituting a system of manifests for vessels sailing between their poits and Bahrein; and he thought that the assurance which the Bahrein broieinment were ready to give would solve the difficulty arising out of the Afimedi case, to which he knew that King Abdul Aziz attached special importance. But he was not himself familiar with the present state of the question, having left Jedda before the latest discussions, and would therefore have to refer the matter to the King. Some discussion followed upon the procedure which should be followed in drawing up the formal agreement to embodv the results of the conference It was agreed that the perpetual undertaking with reference to the case of the steamship A hmedi should be contained in a separate note, while the other results ot the conference would be embodied in an exchange of notes between His Majesty s Government and the Saudi Government, to be exchanged either in London or m Jedda^ The Foreign Office would endeavour to produce the necessary drafts for Fuad Bey to see before he left England on the 22nd Julv It was however, explained to Fuad Bey that this might not after all be possible since the wording of the translation of the Bahreini delegates’ letter to the Saudi delegates, recording the position reached in the local conference, appeared to contain some small ambiguities, such as the technical department of the Foreign Office might object to incorporating in an official Anglo-Saudi exchange of notes The Foreign Office would, however, do their best; but the actual exchange of notes vvould, in any case, have to be postponed, as Fuad Bey would have to submit the drafts to his Government for their approval.

POLITICAL Department. P® dtx Colonel Loch’s telegram of the 22nd March, summarising the results of the local Conference at Bahrain between Saudi and Bahraini delegates, on the question of the transit dues, was submitted at P.Z.2055/35* Since that submission was made the local agreement reached at the Conference has been modified to the extent that Ibn Saud has waived the right to import goods for his personal use free of duty up to the value of 2 lakhs, in return for a ^ per cent, reduction in the transit dues on all goods transhipped at Bahrain in transit to or from Saudi Arabia. The terms of the local agreement were embodied in a letter of the ?th April from the Chief Bahraini delegate at the Conference to the chief Saudi delegate, which is flagged at P.Z.2800/35* After discussion with the Foreign Office it was agreed (see Foreign Office telegram No.74 of the 8 th May at P.Z.3202/35) that when the settlement reached locally was confirmed through the diplomatic channel, in an exchange of notes, it should be made subject to ^ ■ denunciation at 6 months 1 notice, except for the Bahrain*, undertaking regarding the non-repetition of the Ahmedi case, which the Foreign Office felt strongly should continue to apply irrespective of the duration of the remainder of the agreement. (it will be remembered that the Ahmedi incident was the case where the Bahrain Government claimed payment of transit dues % on the cargo of the s.s. 'Ahraedi” consigned direct to the mainland, and neither landed nor transhipped at Bahrain, and would not allow the Ahmedi to land its Bahrain cargo when payment of such dues was refused by the Captain of the vessel). The Saudi Government, for their part.(Jedda telegram Ho.107 of 8th May at P.Z.3234/35) were prepared to agree to a formal exchange of notes constituting an agreement, on the basis of the Bahraini delegate's letter of 7th April, and did not object to the ° f tJle validit y of the agreement to any period we ■,J tr.w, t, except as regards the undertaking about the Ahmedi case^ which the Saudi Government maintained was contrary to international law. i atters nad reached this stage when the Government of India sent their telegram of the 11th May at P.Z. 3253 / 35 , m which they argue that the Bahrain Government should not be expected to surrender in perpetuity their only weapon (i.e. the threat to repeat the Ahmedi incident) against the eventual strangulation of her transit trade. This telegram has provoked the Foreign Office, who have always felt very strongly that the Ahmedi incident could not in any circumstances be repeated, to send us their long letter of the 14th June below. Some of the arguments in the Foreign Office letter are not, 1 think, particularly good, and some of them seem to be considerably overstressed. For example, the statement by the Board of Trade, quoted m paragraph 3 of their letter, is really irrelevant in this connection, while the Government of India's telegram ol 1st Feoruary, to which the Foreign Office direct our attention,'with particular emphasis' in paragraph 4, was only a telegram saying that the Government of India 'had no further observations'^ sent in reply to a telegram from the Secretary of State which dealt primarily with the Government of India's proposal that Bahrain should give up altogether the policy of charging transit dues^ and only mentioned in parenthesis that His Majesty's Government wouU be unable to agree to penalisation of direct shipments (i.e. the Ahmedi policy). On the other hand, the generalMinute Paper. Department. case made out 'by the Foreign Office against limiting the validity of the Bahraini assurance about the Ahmedi case, is extremely strong and indeed it was generally agreed at an earlier stage that while the Bahrain Government's action in this case may have been within Bahrain's sovereign rights, it was very high handed and most difficult to defend, and that His Majesty's Government could not in fact permit the Bahrain Government to resort to it again (though it is no doubt true that the Government of India have never formally expressed their concurrence in this view). In this connection please see the record of. the meeting held on 8 th October lasl^ flagged A, at the bottom of the file. The Government of India's argument that the Bahrain* undertaking about the Ahmedi case has been offered only as part of a general settlement, does not really hold water, since that undertaking was really given because the Ahmedi policy was felt to be indefensible^ was only given as part of a general settlement as a matter of tactics. Moreover the Government of India's present attitude seems somewhat inconsistent with their previous proposal that Bahrain should abandon her transit dues altogether in the hope that this would deprive Ibn Baud of the inducement to develop his Hasa ports. It will be seen fromparagraph 6 of the Resident's telegram l'o*177 of 7th February (P.Z. 921/35) that the Bahrain Government are well aware that they can no longer penalise direct shipments, and that Colonel Fowle actually procured a confidential communication to that effect from the Bahrain Government several months ago. Finally the actual terms of the assurance regarding theU. Ahmedi policy^'by the Bahrainis at the local Gonferencef anql emhodied in the Bahraini letter of 7th April (P. Z.2800/35) viz. 'the Bahrain Govemment representatives stated that the Bahrain Govemment hereby give the assurance that this would not he done by us in future certainly give the impression that the assurance was meant (as stated by the Foreign Office) to be permanently binding. In all the circurastances and in the general interests of future Anglo-Saudi and Saudi-Bahraini relations, we must, I think, agree with the Foreign Office view that the Ahmedi undertaking must be regarded as permanently binding and that its validity cannot be limited by making it subject to denunciation at 6 months’ notice. A draft telegram to the Government of India and a draft letter to the Foreign Office are submitted accordin^ly. TjU f 0 ^ '~ u ^y ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ -b- l-K f ‘io ^rt- A. iv-c o-n f €y rc , ^ ,u icu^u. a-.

It will have been observed from Sir Andrew Ryan f s telegram No. 107 of the 8th May that the Saudi Government are ready, on one condition, to confirm, by an exchange of notes with His Majesty's Government, the agreement which resulted from the local conference recently held at Bahrain. That condition is that the Bahrain Government’s undertaking not to revert to the policy which they employed in the case of the s.s. ’’Ahmedi” shall be given permanent validity irrespective of the term of validity to be agreed on for the rest of the local settlement. 3.

'Ahmedi' was at variance with all international practice and most unwise from the international point of view - a view which has been endorsed by the Board of Trade - are already known to your Department and need not here be set forth again at length. The general attitude of His Ma^'esty^ Government in such matters was clearly stated, after consultation with the Board of Trade, as recently as the 2nd April last, in another connexion, in the following terms; 'in no case can we 'agree to exercise any form of examination, supervision or 'control over goods which remain in a vessel which visits this 'country in the course of her voyage and are not unloaded'. (A copy of Foreign Office telegram No. 68 of the End April to Geneva containing this statement of policy was communicated semi-officially to the India Office in Foreign Office letter No. E 2210/191/25 of the 17th April), and a further copy is annexed for facility of reference. 4. It will be remembered that at an interdepartmental meeting held on the 8th October last, at which the political Resident in the Persian Gulf was present, it was agreed that the objections raised by this Department, by His Majesty's Minister at Jedda, and by the Board of Trade to the 'Ahmedi 'policy', were so substantial as to exclude any idea of a renewal or general application of that policy to vessels calling at Bahrain and also taking direct shipments to the Hasa coast of Saudi Arabia. It was furthermore agreed that, unless king Ibn Saud were given a categorical assurance that such measures would not be resorted to in future, there was no prospect whatever of a satisfactory settlement of the connected question of the transit dues, in this connexion, Iam to draw attention to paragraph 4 of India Office telegram j No. 325 of the 31st January to the Government of India, and with particular emphasis to the Government of India T s telegram No. 261 of the following day in reply thereto. In due course the Political Resident reported in his telegram No. 177 of the 7th February that the Bahrain Government were well aware that they could no longer penalise direct shipments to Saudi Arabia and had already informed him confidentially in writing to this effect. 5. There was in these communications to and from the Government of Bahrain no indication that this renunciation of the 'Ahmedi policy” was intended by His Majesty's Government, by the Government of India or by the Government of Bahrain to be anything but of permanent application, and it had, indeed, been generally recognised that such a renunciation was inevitable and that nothing less would satisfy the Saudi Government. On this understanding therefore the conference was called and duly took place at Bahrain. The transit dues were adjusted by agreement and the assurance on the 'Ahmedi 'policy” was duly given, without qualification, in paragraph 4 of the Bahrain Government's letter of the 7th April to the Saudi delegates. There is, in the Secretary of state's view, no room whatever for doubt that this promise was meant to be permanently binding. In these circumstances the Secretary of State can only view with concern and with surprise the attitude now adopted by the Government of India in their telegram No. 1238 of the 11th May. &lt;3. The Secretary of State does not consider that the Government of India's attitude is warranted by the arguments adduced in that telegram, which can, in his opinion, be /disposeddisposed of as follows; (1) The undertaking regarding the discontinuance of the 'Ahmedi policy' was given because that policy was indefensible, and it was only given as part of a general settlement because the illegitimacy of that policy would otherwise have had to be admitted# By the general settlement now reached Bahraini-Saudi trade relations will be placed once more on an amicable basis and a strong inducement to king Ibn Saud to develop his port at Ras Tanurah will thereby have been removed. Though the 'Ahmedi policy' may have been temporarily effective fat some cost to Anglo-Saudi relations) in gaining a respite for the transit trade from a natural process of decline, the Secretary of State does not consider that it could have proved effective in the long run, nor can he admit that it would become legitimate with the disappearance of the present Saudi regime. (2) On the second point it need only be observed that the principles of international usage are no less applicable to relations between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia than to relations between other states, and that the view of those principles held by this Department and the Board of Trade differs entirely from that apparently held by the Government of Ind ia. (3) The disadvantage which Bahrain fto say nothing / of His Majesty T s Government) would suffer from a breakdown of the present settlement would, in the /SecretarySecretary of State's view be most serious. Not only would King Ibn Saud have once more a very strong incentive to develop Has Tanurah, but, with a wealthy American Oil Company beginning operations on that coast, there is little doubt that he could procure the necessary money, the lack of which has hitherto mainly prevented his doing so. 7. The menace to Anglo-Saudi relations which a revival of the 'Ahmedi policy', or a Justified fear on the part of Ibn Saud that this policy might be revived (whether on six months' notice or otherwise) is one which the Secretary of State is unwilling to contemplate, more particularly since he regards the policy itself as indefensible on grounds of international practice and comity and ill-adapted to achieve the object at which it is apparently directed. It will be remembered that King Ibn Saud used very bitter language in this connexion during Sir Andrew Ryan's interview with him at Taif in July 1934. His Majesty's Government are in Xing Ibn Saud's eyes naturally regarded as responsible for the Bahrain Government's policy in such major matters, and, whatever may be the theoretical position, there is no doubt that, if the 'Ahmedi policy” were to be revived, His Majesty's Government could not escape the odium of having at least acquiesced in such a step. It will further be remembered that His Majesty's Minister at Jedda has ranked this subject as second only to the question of the eastern frontiers of Saudi-Arabia as a potential source of Anglo-Saudi friction. 8. It will be clear from the foregoing that there are the strongest reasons in favour of His Majesty's Government /endorsingendorsing the view expressed by Sir Andrew Ryan in the first paragraph of his telegram No. 112 of the 13th May. It appears therefore in the highest degree desirable that on the threefold ground of international usage, of the future of Anglo-Saudi relations, and of the best interests of Bahrain itself, the Bahrain Governments undertaking not to revive the 'Ahmedi 'policy” should be made permanently binding. I am accordingly to express the hope that the Secretary of State for India will strongly urge the Government of India to agree to this being done as soon as possible, as proposed in paragraph 4 of Noreign Office telegram No. 74 of the 8th May to His MajestyS Minister at Jedda.

It would in my opinion he equally regrettable from point of view of our relations ?dth Ibn Saud if fa) we did anything to suggest that Ahmadi incident might be repeated at six months notice or (b) v/e allowed what has been one of the most promising attempts to settle some of the outstanding questions to end in nothing. 2. May I suggest following 'middle' solution which turns however on your attitude towards Saudi proposal for prolongation of validity of treaty of Jedda for ten years? (a) undertaking to be given that Ahmadi incident will not be repeated while treaty of Jedda remains in force, (b) other points to be embodied in separate exchange of notes with duration clause as proposed in your telegram no, 74. This, I think, should be bilateral for the sake of form and also be cause Bahrain Government do secure one advantage namely that agreement if concluded will preclude Saudi Government from asking for exemption. 3. In any case I should much prefer you and hesidency in Bahrain to see my draft note before it assumes final form. I'would oropose therefore to inform Yusuf Yasin in reply to suggestion mentioned in last paragraph of my telegram no.107 that I have now been authorised to prepare draft but must sub mit it for approval after which it can either be discussed with I-uad in London or be communicat g d to Saudi Government bv Calvert, oreferably the former if draft can be ready in time in spite of difficulties which have arisen.

BAHRAINI-SA* UDI C0HVERSATI0H3. (^) ( ' 1. The conversations between representatives of/. the Bahrain and Sa^di Governments, reported at length in paragraph No.48 of the last Intelligence Report, ended by the Bahrain representatives forwarding a letter on the 7th April to the Sa'udi delegates summarizing the settlement arrived at during the course of the conversations. Two days later the leader of the Sa’udi delegation acknowledged the receipt of the letter referred to above and thanked the Ruler of Bahrain and the Bahrain Government for the hospitality and kindness shown to them in Bahrain. 2. The Sa’udi delegates came to wish the Political Agent goodbye on the 9th April and in the course of conversation stated that they had every intention of developing Ras Tanurah as a port, inferring by their attitude that they had no intention of subsidizing the Bahrain Government longer. 3.

In the course of their conversations the Sa’udi Representatives asked (i) That special treatment should be given to King Bin Sa’ud in regard to the payment of transit duty# (ii) That transit dues on overside delivery should be abolished# (iii) That transit dues on goods landed and reahipped should be reduced# and (iv) That the 'Ahmedi' incident should not be repeated.- (3) After several discussions the Bahrain Representatives# on the grounds of ancient friendship# agreed:- (a) that goods up to the value of two lakhs of rupees annually for King Bin Sa’ud’s personal use would be passed through free# proviaed the Bahrain Government received a communication from the Sa’udi Government informing them that the goods were for the King; (b) that the concession of overside delivery from steamers which had hitherto been limited to consignments of 1#0X) bags or over would be reduced to 100 bags# and Later ’Abdullah al Qusaibi took Ha^ji *A' At this stage one Ahmad bin ’Abdullah al (c) that the ”Ahmedi u incident would not recur.(3) The 8a’uai Representatives also asked that manifests should be issued to all dhows going to Sa’udi ports i*rom Bahrain and that the duty on Haoa dates shoild be revised. The Bahrain Representatives agreed that fnaniiesta would be issued on a basis of reciprocity, and that the duty on Haaa dates would be levied at B# aa valorem on dates entering Bahrain and 2% ad valorem on dates shipped through Bahrain. This latter i-epreaents a big concession since the existing duties were fixed some ten years ago. The tentative settlement arrived at appears to have satisfied the Sa’udi Representatives. (4) Hamad Sulaiman bin Haradan was summoned urgently to the mainland and left for Jubail on the 20th March. He is returned to Bahrain on the 22nd. It/underatood that the reason for his going to the mainland was an apprehension that the delegations telegraphic communications w ^re being tampered with in Bahrain. (5) After Hamad Bulaiman bin Hamdan’s return and after the tentative settlement mentioned in paragraphs (1) to (3) above had been referred to King bin Sa’ud, the Sa'udi delegation again met the Bahrain Representatives and qualified paragraph 2(a) as follows King Bin Sa’ud did not wish any personal concession from the Bahrain Government but instead preferred a prox^ortional reduction in the transit dues at present levied. It ie understood that this has been agreed to by the Bahrain Representatives and a one-eighth reduction granted without any stipulations as to fluctuations. At present the proportional reduction of one-eighth represents two lakhs of rupees* 49. r n:iUoiA‘fr*o l OTu&gt; l r. 1. iiii i \ M JiAti. ( a ) Tifi - r?1 ^ i' Tn tTH n Uo. 3/FCN/DIA.

In that event, concessions now granted will be of little value to the Saudis, so that denunciation alone will not help Bahrein greatly and it may be necessary to revert to policy originally approved in your telegram of 31st January, 325. But, in order that Bahrein Government may retain freedom to meet such contingency, we reconmend clause should be inserted permitting denunciation by either party after one year on giving three months’ notice.

Only alteration to agreement is that Bin Saud has waived eonoession granted him in paragraph Ho.2 and requested that instead a proportional decrease in transit duties should be granted on all imports to mainland. Bahrein representatives have agreed to this and fixed one-eighth per cent, reduction, which represents 2 lakhs on last yearns figures. The one~eighth per cent, reduction however is subject to no stipulations with regard to fluctuations. 3. Incidental to Saudi delegation's official activities, the members are reported to be taking unfair advantage of personal concessions granted to them by Bin Saud oi importing into Saudi Arabia all goods they require free of duty by buying large stocks of goods, principally silk, for other merchants in Hasa.123from Janaging A^entt f British India steam Uavlga. tion Company Limited, to ths Daputy Secretary to the Corezn* ruent of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Hew Delhi* We hare the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter Ho*P* 166 -h/ 34 of the 28th ultimo regarding direct shipment to the Hasa Coast* We aure much obliged for the info motion you glre us that the question of the lery of transit and re-export duty by the Shaikh of Bahrein is still under the considera tion of His Majesty* s GoTemment and the Bahrein Government and that it is hoped that negotiations with the Saudi TO HASA COAST * Government which are now in progress may lead to an amicable settl ement* URE I &amp;Notes.

From colonel Loch's telegram below it looks as though an eminently satisfactory settlement haa been reached, though we have still, of course, to secure Ibn Saud*s confirmation of it. The Bahreinis on their side have given an undertaking that there would be no repetition of the ’ , 'Ahmeai ,, incident; have made concessions to the King as regards goods imported for his personal use; have modified the arrangements in respect of overside delivery from steamers; and have made what is apparently an important concession, though its exact nature is not quite clear, in respect of dates entering or shipped through Bahrein. But they will retain their right to levy transit duty on 3330 1000 12.34 goods/npOHMH - a - goods transhipped from dhows; they seem likely, 'by the concessions they have made to take away the principal inducement to Ibn Saud to develop Has Tanurah, and it looks as though the effect of the discussions on relations both between Saudi Arabia and Bahrein and between Saudi Arabia and H.M.G. should be beneficial. 2. We may no doubt expect to receive in due course a report from the Political Agent commenting in greater detail on the discussions. But this is a very satisfactory opening to the general negotiations with Ibn Saud and we shall be fortunate do if we can/at all so well over the next item - the Koweit Blockade.

Post Box No. 163. Calcutta, 17th October 1934. To a.1^7 Sir SHIP1@HTS ^0 INLAND PORTS NEAR 3 A URL IH. We have the honour to attach a copy of a letter dated 11th instant which this Company^ Agents in Bombay have addressed to the Hon*ble the Politico! Resident in the Persian Cjlf, ?ushire. It will be observed that this Company have been forced to decline to send steamers to the above- mentioned ports, firstly because of the navigational dangers entailed in making the port of Has Tanurah, secondly the difficulties of obtaining a suitable anchorage with adequate swinging room for the vessels, and finally because this Company is definitely unwilling to take any action which might prejudice the good relations which have existed between the Shaikh of Bahrein and this Company for a considerable period and which relations we are extremely loathe to jeopardize• At the same time it is apparent that Ibn Satid will demand that vessels will proceed direct to Has Tanurah cr other ports on the mainland, in order to escape payment to the Shaikh of Banrein oi the duty on any cargo passing through the latter port and intended for discharge in Ibn Saud’s territory. Further it would appear that owing to the recent war in xhs-.'ih whichI — — : v'—yp Awhich Ibn baud was engaged, the financial standing of his Government precludes the expenditure on improvements necessary before Has Tanurah can be considered a safe port at which vessels can oe berthed and discharged. This Company have for a considerable number of years steadily built up the trade between ports in the Persian Gulf and India, and this Company is very naturally reluctant to allow new comers to participate in that trade. In the circumstances therefore we have the honour Jd to enquire whether there is any likelihood of the Government of Ibn Saud undertaking the necessary expenditure to make Rae Tanurah a safe port for ocean-going vessels, and alternatively whether in the event of Ibn Saud not being in a position to carry out the required work, the Government of India are prepared to undertake the survey and proper marking of the channels to Ras Tanurah. This Company will also very much appreciate an expression, if possible, of your views regarding the possibility of the witndrawal by the Shaikh of Bahrein of the enforcement of duty on cargo which may happen to pass through Bahrein on its way to Ras Tanurah. We would add that any information which you may be prepared to give us on this subject will be treated as very strictly Private and Confidential. We have, etc. , Sd/- Maikinnonmaikinzie &amp; Co.

We have the honour to invite your attention to the subject of steamers calling at the Port of Ras Tanurah. Up to the present we have declined to send our Mail steamers into that port for two reasons, firstly because of the navigational dangers entailed in making the port of Has Tanurah and the difficulties of finding a suitable anchorage with adequate swinging room for the vessels and secondly because we were unwilling to take any action which might prejudice the good relations which have existed between this Company and the Shaikh of Bahrein for a very long period* Unfortunately indications are that we shall be forced to send steamers to Ras Tanurah or allow other Lines to intervene in the Persian Gulf trade which this Company has built up over an extensive period as it is obvious that any Line willing to send steamers to Ras Tanurah will be unable to maintain a service to that port only and cover expenses* The s*s, ^Ahmedi 11 called at the Ras Tanurah in 1952 and the s.s. •Fagervik' called last year and it is therefore clear that the danger to which we allude is not imaginary and we apprehend that unless this Company can take steps to cater for the trade Ion Laud will coins to some arrangement with another Line as, according to our information, he is determined to obtain regular direct shipment to Ras Tanurah* We have the honour to enquire therefore if there is any possibility of the Government under-taking the- —the survey and proper marking of the channels to Has Tanurah to afford safe passages to vessels bound for that port and whether you could see your way to approach the Shaikh of Bahrein with a view to obtaining the withdrawal of all notifications placing restrictions on vessels calling at Bahrein when such vessels have also cargo for direct discharge at mainland ports, Te have f etc, Sd/- Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co.

I am hampered by not having received telegrams referred to in telegram under reference but in view of 7 your telegram No 0 30 I have now written personal letter to Fuad suggesting that if Saudi government definitely agree to local conference it should be held at the end of February or very early in March. The addition of the latter words seem necessary in view of shortness of time available. I have embodied the agenda proposed in India Office telegram to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Noo274 amplified ty verbiage only to make them look more impressive. Having regard to inferences as to Political Resident’s views suggested by paragraph 3 of telegram under reference I have used only the expression 'local conference”. I sincerely hope however that nothing will be done to alter the character of the conference as defined in my note of May 13th-.1933 to the Saudi government and Mr. Rendel's letter of December 14th,1933 to the Saudi Minister in London.

Please see previous submission on P*Z.672/35 below and Colonel Powle’s telegram of 7th February, 2. It is difficult to press the instructions approved on P.Z.672 in the face of the objections seen by the Resident and Colonel Loch, though I am not sure that the Residents arguments are entirely watertight, and in particular we cannot overlook the risk that once it has been made clear to the Saudis that there is no longer any objection to direct shipment to the Hasa coast and that no penalties will be imposed on shippers engaging in the direct trade an inducement of some importanceJto the Saudis to develop Ras Tanurah(^will have been afforded. 3.

I am reluctant to elatorate agenda of the conference heyond the two items stated in India Office telegram No, 274 (of January 26th) to Bushire, since to do so may invite inconvenient and premature discussion with ScOidi government. Moreover any material change in agenda would necessitate further reference to Sheikh, who has approved programme already suggested 0 This it is desirahle to avoid.

Por your inf 0 rmati 0 n it would 0 f course be possible to elaborate agenda as follows (a) treatment of vessels which call at Bahrain and carry goods on to Saudi ports without trans shipment (Ahmedi case).

I think Bahrein conference, which I should prefer to call a 'conversation’’ and which was originally meant to he quite informal (see paragraph No.2 of my telegram 67 of January 25th, 1933) will have more chance of success if representatives from both sides can talk at large to each other in Arab fashion rather than if they are tied down by a strict agenda drawn up on formal lines, EEiffi&amp; facie the abstract agenda- (a) and (b) mentioned in paragraph No.2 of your telegram of the 26th ultimo, 274, should be sufficient to attract Saudi Government if they really intend conference to materialise. It could, I surest, be pointed out to themt that in sending representatives for 'conversation' they commit themselves to nothing. bl*? L ,^ i £ 4 .

Fas) Tanura 9 that what work he has done already has been of little practical importance (xidJt my letter 629«S, of the 5th July, 1934) and that Rasa Gil Company, who are believed to have some arrangement with him for development of Ras Tanura, have (vlg# paragraph No*3* my telegram 56, of the 14th January) built a pier at Dammam, where steamers cannot go. Moreover, leading Bahrein^Najdi merchants, Qusaibis and others, who should be best judgeof chance of developments on mainland*are buying land In Bahrein* 3* This being so, proposal in your paragraph N0o4, would, I am afraid, give unfortunate (though mistaken )impression to Bahrein Government (who are of course well Informed as to position at Rasiamra and who 'f .JL'. -.vULi—• have not forgotten that in 1920, under pressure from us, they lowered their transit dues for what they considered was to the benefit of Ibn Saud) that we were now asking them to give up for advantage of the (?

E 8 th January, 1935. ky daar Gilbert, I Nave been considei*ing Walton f s letter No. P.Z. 378/35 of tile 25th January to me about Bahrain transit dues and I thinh that, generally speahing, we do not differ from you in our view of the policy to be pursued in regard to the transit dues themselves. in point of fact the action to be tahen in regard to them is largely an economic question which the Bahrain Government must decide for themselves, and, although from our own point of view we shall naturally be pleased at any concession which is likely to make the Saudi authorities easier for us to deal with over other matters, we do not feel that we have any particular departmental interest in this aspect of the question. 2. We agree with the views expressed in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) of Walton^ letter and see no /objection J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E. Mobjection to the reply which in paragraph 2 (a) he proposes to return to the representation*of the British India Steam navigation Company. 3. There is, however, one aspect of this matter which is only cursorily dealt with in Walton s letter and to which we do attach great importance. As you know, I feel strongly that most of our difficulties over the transit dues question have been due to the action of the Bahrain authorities in putting themselves in the wrong over the 'Ahmadi' incident, the result of which has been that the Saudis have been unwilling to discuss any new arrangements until they have obtained an assurance from us or from the Bahrain Government that vessels carrying cargoes direct to Saudi ports will not oe penalised in consequence. I am convinced that, until the nabrain authorities have put themselves in the right about this, no real progress will be possible, whatever other concessions the Bahrain Government may be prepared to make And I need hardly add that so long as the Saudi Government do not get what seems to me legitimate satisfaction on j thistills point, it is extremely unlikely that they will abandon wnatever plans they may have for the development of Ras Tanurah as a real alternative and rival to Bahrain. In the light however of Ryan 1 s telegram No. 8 , which was evidently received after Walton's letter had been drafted and a copy of which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No. S 497/191/&amp;5 of the 23rd January to the India Office, it now seems that it may fortunately be unnecessary to give the Saudi Government any assurance on this point before the projected conference.at Bahrain. This is perhaps as well, since, if an assurance had indeed been forced from us before the conference net, the Saudis, having gained one of their main objectives, might have tried to slip out of the conference altogether. we are, therefore, fully in agreement with you that our best course is to do all we can to secure Saudi assent to the conference and to give the required assurance at the conference instead. 4. But in saying this I feel bound to make it clear that we can only concur in this procedure on the /understandingunderstanding that, when the conference meets, an assurance in the sense I have indicated above will in fact be given to the Saudi Government, and that the Bahrain Government, having secured the conference, will not try to avoid this obligation. 5* I understand that you are already drafting a telegram to Fowle, suggesting the course to which he should endeavour to obtain the Bahrain Government’s consent. 1 think we are both agreed that the sooner the consent of the sheikh of Bahrain to our policy in this matter can be secured, the better it will be, and X understand that you would like Fowls to have his instructions a few days before he arrives at Bahrain on his forthcoming visit. If, after receiving this letter, you feel that there is still sufficient material for a meeting and that it is desirable to hold one, would you let me know? I fear, however, that I am very heavily booked up and snail not be able to attend a meeting myself before Thursday of this week. On the other hand, you nay think that there is now so little divergence between /ourour points of view that a meeting will be unnecessary and that you vjill probably be able to prepare a draft telegram in such terms that we are unlikely to have any fundamental criticism to make of it. If so, we will do our best at this end to give speedy consideration to any draft you may send us.

The instructions on th^basis of wnich it was agrees last October tnat Sir A* Byan should proceed in Handling this matter with the Saudi Government are embodied in para.lb of the record of an interdepartmental conference of 8th October, on P.Z.688b/34. 2. Please now see the Resident's despatch of (/z 772 &gt; 7 ? v ) 20th November, 1064-3 to the Government of India| &lt; lx. metcalfe 1 s o.o. letter of 24th December, and the telegrams of 14th and 17th January from the political Resident and the Government of IndiaVespectively. 3. The position is briefly that: (1) we snould find much difficuity in justifying a policy of retaliation against ships which carried cargo direct to a port on the Saudi mainland; (2) tnere is some risk of a development of Ibn Saud's port of Ras Tanura (or of st-ny other port in the same area) and that all the evidence is tmt the effect of any such development on the prosperity of Bahrein would be most serious for the reasons given in Mr. Metcalfe's letter. 4» In these circumstances the Resident has suggested that as we snail sooner or later have to give way about direct transhipment we had better throw our hand in at once; inform the 3.I.3.N.Go., who have warned us that they cannot much longer resist requests for direct shipment of goods to the Hasa coast, confidentially that we are doing so, and at a pinch offer Ihn saua ourselves to facilitate the 41 2956 6000 7/34development of facilities at Has Tanura. Hie Govt, of India, on tiie other hand, are in favour of the complete abolition of the re-export duties at Bahrein in the interests of keeping the entrepot trade, wnich is of great value, under the control of the 3heikh. They would give no assistance to Ibn saud to develop his ports ana would prefer, hy removing the re-export duties and so disposing of the factor which is most likely to operate to encourage him to develop his ports, to endeavour to persuade him to abandon any action on these lines. b. I think on thevhole that the G.of I. have made out a very strong case for the course of action they propose. Admittedly there is an element of uncertainty as to the stage at which Has Tanura (or any other port ^.on the Arab-shore) will be developed and as Bahrein, as kr. iv^etcalfe points out, stands to gain rather than to loss by delay there is something to be said for not showing our hand too soon, we are, however, faced with a positive request from the B.I. 3 .N.C 0 . for an indication of our policy^jauid^both in the interests of assisting British shipping in this area and of preventing the development of direct shipments in Japanese or other ships to the Saudi coast, we ought, I think, to be prepared to take action almost immediately ^As lor the effect on Bahrein 01 the abolition of re-export auty, I have always understood both from kajor Prior and kr. Belgrave that Bahrein could not in any circumstances afford to allow the establishment of a port at Has Tanura and that if the danger of this became imminent it would be necessary to cancel the 2% duty and allow free transhipment at once, a decisive argument oeing that Has Tanura could become a port and acquire/351 - 3 - Minute Paper. Department. acquire a population only by taking tiaa trade ana population away from Bahrein. The /eftua/tion has moreover eased in the last couple of years with the development of oil in Bahrein. The 3heikh will he entitled to a minimum royalty of Bs.75,000 from now onwards. All the inaications are that as the Bahrein Petroleum company apparently contemplate active production his income will he very substantially | ; greater than this (e.g. a shipload of 100,000 barrels of oil which is being made this month will bring him in nearly Rs.50,000 royalty). In these circumstances the relatively small revenue to be aerived from the transit cues (.estimated at Rs.30,000 only in the presarty year) is of much less importance than in the past. P 6. As for the handling of this question, both i the G.of I. ana the Resident renain in favour of allowing it to be handled in the first^Lnstance locally at Bahrein and they would prefer that if the concession is to be made it should be made in the course of such a local conference. The Foreign Office do not altogether share this view, so far as can be judged, from informal discussion, they would much prefer that this concession, which may be‘of importance in the forthcoming negotiations with Ibn Baud, should be placed at the disposal of the Mnister. On thu whole, however, I think we may support the view of the G.of I. and the Resident and press the F.O. to let the instructions to sir A. Ryan (on the lines of para. 15 of the record on P.Z.6885/34) stand. If it becomes apparent either that the Saudis will in no circumstances agree to negotiate locally, or that the/ 2956 6000 7/54% , v - 4 - making of this concession would he of decisive irnportarji in the negotiations, we can consider the matter further* We shall presumably, before ary commitment is entered into, have to make sure that the sheikn of Bahrein is prepared to agree to abolition. 7. I submit that I might be authorised to write d.o. to Ivr. Mendel as in the draft attached. ^7 ce hr. I.etcalfe's letter of 24th December should be read, as the suggestion made by the G. of I. gives a new turn to the discussion of the question of the Bahrein transit dues. The suggestion is that Bahrein's entrepot trade is such an important element in her prosperity that it ?/ould be well worth her while to sacrifice the transit dues altogether in order to retain it. If the 2% transit duty on goods imrnmiM&amp;d at Bahrein were abolished, Ibn Baud might no longer desire to undertake the expense of developing a port on the mainland. The experience of free ports elsewhere tends to support this reasoning. The G. of I.'s suggestion, moreover, originates with Major Prior, who has an intimate acquaintance with Bahrein and with the problem of the transit dues. Col. Fowle's statement that the transhipment dues are the only advantage that $■££? gets from the absence of a port on the mainland is too shortsighted, and is answered by the G. of I.'s telegram of 17th January. He, apparently, would retain the duties, but at the same time recommends that our policy should be framed on the hypothesis that Ibn Baud will in any case develop his port, and that we should make a virtue of necessity and offer him assistance in doing so, with a view to making the/ mMinute Paper. Department. the approach to it safe for British shipping. It is true that if the port is developed it will be highly desirable that British shipping should be enabled to use it, but Col. Fowle’s hypothesis seems, as the G. of I. say, to be unduly pessimistic, and it would seem well worth while to try whether we cannot prevention post pone^ the development of Has Tanurah by giving Ibn Baud the advantage of a free port at Bahrein. If Ibn Baud should, either at once or later on, nevertheless proceed with the development of a port of his own, it would always be open to Bahrein to re impose her duties if it were considered to be in her interests to do so.

Yours sincerely, J.G. LAITHWAITE. K.A. Johnstone, Esq., Foreign Office. f ||r BY AIR MAIL Conriden tial D.O.No.F.166-N/34.! New Delhi, 0 We have read with great interest the record or the Departmental Conference of October 8th on relations between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain forwarded with your Air Mail endorsement No.P.Z.6885/1934, dated the 9th November 1934. We have since received the Political Resident's letter No. 1064-S• , dated the 20th November 1934, of which a copy was sent to you direct. 2. As you will observe a new and possibly important factor has now been introduced into the problem, viz. the possibility of foreigi shipping being encouraged by an obstructive attitude on the part of the Bahrain Government to compete with British lines in the Persian Gulf carrying trade. It would therefore seem advisable to take stock of tW situation and to consider carefully (a) what are our precise objectives. (b) what is the best means of achieving them. It will no doubt be agreed that our main objectives are (i) to safeguard the financial interests of Bahrain which, if it were to lose its present position as the entrepot for the Arab Coast Trade, would probably suffer complete financial collapse. (2) to assist in so far as may be possible British shipping firms to retain their presentmr li 3i*vJ - 2 - present predoiiiinant position in the Persian Gulf, which would he threatened if they declined to carry cargo direct to Ihn Saud^ ports on the mainland and foreign firms (e.g. Japanese firms who have already shown interest in this trade) are able and willing to do so. These two objectives are to some extent conflicting but it appears to the Government of India that the conflict can be resolved and both objectives achieved, if the establish ment of an effective port at Bas Tanurah or elsewhere on the mainland by Ibn Saud can be prevented or at least indefinite ly postponed. Bahrain’s interest in such developments lies not only in the loss of her transit dues which are a comparatively small item but also in general loss of trade and inhabitants. Should Ras Tanurah become a port for ocean-going ships it would be necessary for shipping agents and merchants* who now prefer the safety and amenities of Bahrain, to migrate to Ras Tanurah. Thus the revenue which now accrues to Bahrain from customs duties on articles consumed locally would materially decrease and their profits from trade would largely disappear. 3. It remains to consider whether it is possible to persuade Ibn Saud to drop his schemes for mainland ports and if so what arguments are most likely to appeal to him. Bowiei -3- Fowle in his latest communication takes the view that the establishment of a port at Ras Tanurah is inevitable and that we should make the best of a bad job and assist in making the port safe for British shipping. The Goveirunent of India however consider that this view is unduly pessimistic. In the first place we know that Ibn Saud has been unable during the last two years to make any real progress towards making Ras Tanurah a suitable and safe port for ocean-going ships. He is moreover most unlikely to be in a position to spend much money on it in the near future as his exchequer was put to a great strain by the recent operations against the Yemen. To us it seems that his annoyance over the Bahrain transit dues and his desire to get them removed is due In part at least to the knowledge that he cannot develop the mainland ports without an amount of expense and trouble which he is not prepared to face. If this estimate/is correct it would need no great concessions to induce him to he reasonable. Turning now to the question of what Bahrain can offer we are strongly inclined to the view that she might with advantage to herself surrender her re-export duties altogether, i.e., not only transhipment dues but also dues on goods actually landed at Bahrain and re-exported within 20 days. We have seen the great prosperity which has attended the policy ofof 'free ports' at Singapore, Hong Kong and Aden and Bahrain* e favourable geographical situation vis-a-vis the Hasa hinterland should with the advantage that she has enjoyed for many years enable her to secure an unassailable position as the entrepot of Arab trade. fe understand that the re-export duties at present collected do not exceed about Rs.30,000/- per annum and this though a considerable sum for an impover ished State should be offset by increased income from customs duties on articles consumed or purchased locally. The new income from oil which Bahrain is now commencing to receive should also make it easier for them to risk the surrender of a small and in any case uncertain item of income in order to increase their eventual prosperity. The offer to abolish the re-export duties would we think be sufficient to satisfy Ibn Saud and to postpone indefinitely any attempt on his part to establish Has Tanurah, but Fowle has not yet had an opportunity of commenting upon the suggestion and I am to ask that his comments may be awaited. 4* We have no particular comments to make on the instruc tions which it is proposed to give to Sir Andrew Ryan (vide concluding portion of memorandum enclosed with your P.Z. 688 5/1934 of 9th November 1934) and consider that it will be best that the offer to abolish re-export and transit duties, if the Bahrain Government can be induced to make it, should comeGome direct from them at the proposed Conference rather than from His Majesty's Minister. At present the Bahrain Govern ment gain rather than lose hy delay since they continue to collect their transit dues 'but should Ihn Saud show signs of pressing on with the improvement of Has Tanurah it may he necessary to reconsider the situation. 5. in answer is due to the B.I.S.N. Co. Ltd., who incidentally are fully aware of the position so that their enquiries need not he treated too seriously. We propose if the Secretary of State agrees to authorize the political Resident merely to reply that the whole question is still under the consideration of His Majesty's Government and of the Bahrain Government and that negotiations with the Saudi Government are in progress in the hope of promoting an amicable settlement. It is therefore anticipated that the difficulties which the Company foreshadow will not arise. 6. A copy of this letter is being sent to Powle and also to Ryan J.C.

Subject : Bahrain Transit dues Sir, With reference to correspondence ending with Fr« Laithwaite's letter to me, No.: .S. 6267/34, dat^u the 12th October -934, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter Ho.3027, dated the 11th October, from iessre.Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co.,Bombay, Agents for the British India Steam Navigation Company Ltd. 2. It has been generally accepted now that the action oi the Bahrain Government at the time oi the 'Ahmedi' incident was merely an urgent expedient, that it did not represent a policy and will not be repeated; and it is proposed tnat -Ar undrew Hyan should be authorised in certain circumstances to m-w. a statement in this sense to the Saudi Government in the forthcoming Anglo-Saudi negotiations. 3. It seems to me that the pendulum has now swung back, and since the Bahrain Government cannot repeat the action in the Ahmedi case I suggest that we should take the opportun ity of furthering British shipping interests against the competition of foreign shipping interests by informing kessra. kackinnon /% Mackimion Mackenzie &amp; Co. confidentially that no restrictions will be placed by the Bahrain Government on vessels which carry cargo for direct discharge at mainland ports. The British India Steam Navigation Company,who are the only Company to run a regular weekly service in the Persian Gulf, including Bahrain, will be in a very strong position to eliminate foreign competition if they can make Has Tanurah a regular port of call for their slow mail steamers. 4. I am not aware to what extent the proposed communication to Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. will deprive Sir Andrew Kyan of a card in the forthcoming negotiations, but as it is very likely that the Saudi Government will press early for a statement from His Majesty's Government on the question, it is a card whose value would soon vanish. 5. With regard to Messrs, ^ackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co.'s enquiry as to the possibility of Government undertaking the survey and marking of the channels to Ras Tanurah I propose, if there is no objection, to advise the Company to raise the question with the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Committee. At the same time it is for consideration whether, now th t it is in our interests to render the approach to the port safe for British shipping, we could not make a virtue of necessity by offering to the Saudi Government to undertake, on payment, the work of providing navigational aids for the approach to the port. It is a gesture that would probably be appreciated by Ibn Baud. 6. When, and if, cargo is taken direct to Has Tanurah instead of passing through Bahrain, the Bahrain Government will of course lose heavily on their transit dues, but this • -seems inevitable X am sending copies of this letter to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, His Majesty's Charge d*Affaires Jedda and the iolitical Agent, Bahrain, with whom 1 have dis cussed the question. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd. T. Political Resident C. Fowle, Lieut•-Colonel, in the Persian Gull.2. / mm Copy, British India Steam Navigation Co«Ltd • Bombay, ilth October 1934. * ' ■ No.3027. The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire• Sir, Shipments to Mainland Ports near Bahrain . We have the honour to invite your attention to the subject of steamers calling at the Port of Has Tanurah. Up to the present we have declined to send our Mail steamers into L 1 that port for two reasons, firstly because of the navigational dangers entailed in making the port of Has Tanurah and the difficulties of finding a suitable anchorage with adequate swinging room for the vessels and secondly because we were unwilling to take any action which might prejudice the good relations which have existed between this Company and the Shaikh of Bahrain for a very long period. Unfortunately indications are that we shall be forced to send steamers to Has Tanurah or allow other Lines to intervene in the Persian Gulf trade which this Company has built up over an expensive period as it is obvious that any Line willing to send steamers to Has Tanurah will be unable to maintain a service to that port only and cover expenses. The s.s. , *Ahmedi M called at Has Tanurah in 1932 and the s.s. M Fagervik M called last year and it is therefore clear that the danger to which we allude is not imaginary and we apprehend that unless this Company can taKe steps to cater for the trade Ibn Baud will come to some arrangement with another Line as, according to our information, he is determined to obtain regular direct shipment to Ras Tanurah.2. We have the honour to enquire therefore if there is any possibility of the Government undent- king the survey and proper marking of the channels to Has Tanurah to afford safe passages to vessels bound for that port and whether you could see your way to approach the Shaikh of Bahrain with a view to obtaining the withdrawal of all notifications placing restric tions on Vessels calling at Bahrain when such vessels have also cargo for direct discharge at mainland ports. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servants, Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. Agents.Private secretary, With reference to the Secretary of State’s note helow, I attach a brief note giving the broad outline of tne Bahrein Transit Dues question. Lore uetailed information can be supplied if desired. JUJ UBahrein Transit Dues. Bahrein is the main entrepot for cargo consigned to Saudi Arabia through the Persian Gulf, goods as a rule either being disembarked at Bahrein anu subsequently re-exported, or transnipped overside into lighters which proceed to the Sauai Arabian coast, mere is no developed port on the Arabian coast and it is difficult for ships of a certain draught to proceed to mat coast unless they have previously lightened themselves at some intervening pori^ Nejd and Bahrein are thus to some extent mutually dependent, since Nejd needs the facilities of the port of Bahrein and Bahrein needs the revenues which it derives from its entrepot trade. 2. In 1920, as the result of pressure by H.L.G., Bahrein agreed to reduce the transit duty on ^oous consigned to Ibn Baud’s dominions and landed at Bahrein in transit to the mainland from 5% to 2/ 0 and to allow free transhipment of goods so consigned direct from steamers into lighters in Bahrein waters. As a result of efforts to evade the payment of the transit duty, serious difficulties arose in 1931/32 in connection with the second of these concessions. Ah attempt was in the first place made to extend the right of free transhipment within Bahrein territorial waters to goods transhipped from sailing craft. This was disposed of by an informal agreement reacxded between tne Bahreinis and Ibn Jiluwi, Ibn Baud’s Governor of Hasa. Secondly, there appeared to be some danger of transhipment outside Bahrein territorial waters. Thirdly, a case arose, which became a test case and is known as the AHIf&amp;DI incident, of direct shipment of goods to the mainland in a vessel which, while touching at Bahrein had neither landed nor transhipped her mainland 'Krf' tx 6^. cargo and so claimed * ‘ |i,,w “'■■u'' “ftn-g;' t^nrain transit dues.2 . 3 . Tne AHlviKDI wished to be allowed to discharge her Bahrein cargo at Bahrein ana, naving thereby lightened nerself, to proceed with her Sauai cargo to the Hasa coast. The Bahrein Government, after consultation with the political i%gent, informed the AHkKDI that unless she was prepared to pay tne normal rate of Bahrein transit auty on the cargo consigned to 3audi Arabia she would not be allowed to lana her Banrein cargo, her Captain refused ana proceeded to the riasa coast, where he discharged both his Sauui ana his Bahreini cargo. The Bahreini consignees were ultimately allowed to retransnip the latter to Banrein on payment of a porteraga^ily. 4. The action of the Bahrein authorities had the ) 1/&gt;VU cM. _ effect of stopping any^endeavoursto ship direct to Saudi Arabia through Bahrein waters without paying transit dues and so contributing to the expenditure of the Bahrein Government in maintaining harbour facilities at Bahrein. But while it was within the sovereign rights of the state it was very difficult to defend ana was followed by a strong protest from Ibn Saud. The King, not unnaturally, saw tne nano of the British Government in the action of tne state and has suggested that we are endeavouring to establish what is, in effect, a blockade of the Hasa coast in the sheikh*s interest. 5. His Lajesty’s Government have contrived so far to stave off the various official protests ana enquiries which have been made by Ibn Saud and have concentrated on endeavouring to arrange^for a discussion locally between representatives of Bahrein and of Saudi Arabia, Kt^zrawith the assistance of the political Agent. Ion Sauci, on nis siae, has 'been unwilling to agree to this, ana nas been anxious to secure a settlement, at the expense of Banrein, as the result of airect aiscussion between the Foreign Office ana his minister in Lonaon. In trie course of trie corresponaence which has passed formal notice nas been given on hehalf of Bahrein of tne uetermination of the agreement of 192.0 under which they levy a maximum transit auty of 2 %, but no steps are being taken or will be taken to increase that rate unless and until circumstances make action on these lines quite imperative. 4. The question was again raisea by Fuad Hamza in his recent conversations with tne Foreign Office. The Foreign Office, while giving him to understand that the AHIviEDI incident haa been an isolated one, avoided giving him any guarantee as to what trie Bahrein Government might not ao in the future ana again very strongly urged the importance of a frank aiscussion between tne interested parties at Bahrein, reiterating that a friendly settlement was to the interest of both parties, since, while the transit traae was of great importance to Bahrein, the existence of the transit facilities afforded by Bahrein was likely to be for a considerable time to come of equal importance to Saudi Arabia. Fuad Hamza finally, though reluctantly, agreed CotcM) ajt ) to reopen the question of a conference^ with Ton Saud. 5. we are not on very strorg ground in this matter ana the Sauai case is a gooa one. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia has for the last 15 years enjoyed a rate of auty on goods transhipped at Bahrein more favourable than she had a right to expect, and apart from this, given the close economic connect-ion of. Bahrein ana Sauai Arabia it is very desirable that a working arrangement between the two IStates (to be coniirmeci, ot course, through tae aiploffiatic channel) snoulu 'be reacneu. It was in these circumstances that tne draft instructions to 3 ir A* hyan set out in paragraph 15 of tne record of the discussion at tne Foreign Office on 8 tn October, flagged on P.Z.6885/34 below, were drawn up in consultation with the Ivinister and Colonel Fowle.4.

As the result of discussion in that meeting provisional instructions were prepared which will be found on pages 10-13 of the record. 2. The India Office representatives at an early stage abandoned the suggestion which had been put forward by the Political Resident for consideration,^ that the Bahrein Government should forbid vessels which carry direct cargo for the mainland to call at Bahrein on the same voyage. Tne objections to this proposal are set out in detail in the Foreign Office letter of 1st October on P.Z.6159/34. desirable to adopt a slightly intransigent attitude, the Foreign Office being very anxious to meet Ibn Gaud over this question and much less concerned about tne interests and position of the Bneikn of Bahrein. The draft instructions which emerged from the discussion are, however, I think, on tne wnole (with the amendment in paragraph 15 (3)(d) suggested to the Foreign Office in my letter of 31st October) generally satisfactory.

Ryan Lieut•Colonel Fowle, Mr. Leithwaits ) Mr. G.E. crombie ) Mr. Johnstone ) Mr. Malcolm ) Foreign Office (in the Chair) H.M. Minister at Jedda. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. India Office. Foreign Office. 2. MR. RENDEL recalled that the Saudi Government had been repeatedly invited to send delegates to Bahrain in order to discuss with the Bahrain Government the question of commercial relations between the two States, He v/as doubtful, however, whether the Saudi Government would agree to such a conference while they were still in doubt whether or not His Majesty^ Government were trying to blockade the Hasa coast. It might be necessary to make a definite statement of policy to the Saudi Government in order to persuade them to accept an invitation. 3. SIR A. RYAN stated that his conversation with King Ibn Saud at Talf previous to his departure on leave had convinced him that the King felt with great intensity about this subject, more particularly in regard to what he con ceived to be His Majesty^ Government’s boycott of his attempts to develop the Hasa coast. He took umbrage at anything in the nature of exceptional treatment of his ports as compared with others in the Gulf. He already believedbelieved that the Bahrain Government, whom he identified with His Majesty's Government, were preventing ships from 'ferrying cargo direct to the Hasa. Coast, such a notifica tion hy the Bahrain Government with regard to vessels carry ing. direct cargo for the mainland as Colonel aowle hc,d proposed in his letter No.575/S of the 25th June to Mr. Laithwaite, would only intensify King Ibn baud’s grievance. 4. COLONBL FC'JLE explained that his proposal had been intended as no more than a- tentative suggestion, and that in the light of the views expressed by the Foreign Office (see Mr. Mendel's letter of • to Mr. Laithwaite) and the Board of Trade in regard to it, he was. willing, to withdraw it. 5 . The discussion then passed to the question of the tactics to be adopted vis-a-vis of King Ibn Baud in dealing with this dispute. Assuming that the question of the economic relations between Bahrain and Baudi Arabia would have to be included among the subjects discussed in the proposed general negotiations between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the baudi Government (and the meeting agreed that this question must in fact be pooled with other outstanding questions in these negotiations) it was necessary to draft a line of policy for Bir A.Byan’s guidance. There were two distinct aspects of this question: (a) King Ibn Baud desired an assurance from His Majesty’s Government that the hostile attitude of Bahrain towards direct shipments to Hasa, the most striking example of which was the ’’Ahmedi” ca-se, did not represent the consistent policy of the Bahrein Gov emm en■' ;r Hi s Me j eshy ’ s Gov ernmen 1 &gt;. fb).(Id) Apart from this question of direct shipment to Hasa ports, there was also the question of the rate at which the transit dues levied by the Bahrain Government on goods for the mainland were to he fixed. 6 . With regard to (a) the first point that arose was whether it was permissible or desirable to use the possi bility of a policy of 'blockade' as a threat to induce Ibn Baud to agree to a conference at Bahrain. 7. MR. LAITHWAITE suggested that, although it was clearly desirable to arrange a conference at Bahrain if this could possibly be managed, ultimately, if the Saudi Government proved unaccommodating, a policy in the sense indicated by the Bahrain Government’s action in the 'Ahmedi' case might be justified on grounds of necessity. The Sheikh of Bahrain could not afford to lose the money which came to him from Bahrain’s transit trade and his action in defence of this trade could be justified on those same grounds of urgent economic necessity which Fuad Bey Hamza had recently invoked in defence of the Saudi blockade of Koweit. It therefore seemed legitimate at least to threaten King Ibn Baud with the possibility of action in this sense, and perhaps also to use this threat as a lever to secure the lifting of the Koweit blockade. 8 . MR. RENDEL saw the strongest objection to using an argument which virtually amounted to the thesis that ’necessity knows no law’, even if the Sa,udi Government had themselves appealed to it in connexion with their treatment4. Koweit. In his view such a policy could only he justified as a direct measure of retaliation against the Kowelt blockade - and it had been agreed that there were serious objections to establishing any direct connexion between these two questions. Moreover the influence enjoyed by His Majesty's Government in Arabia and the Persian Gulf rested in fact partly on their not using such retaliatory methods. Two blocks did not make a white and we should gain nothing by using the illegitimate methods sometimes practised by our adversaries. further, the Saudi Govern ment had already been assured that the 'Ahmedi” incident did not represent a settled policy, and that His Majesty’s Government did not intend to blockade Hssa. 9. SIR A.RYAN added that, in his view, the Saudi blockade of Koweit and the suggested Bahraini blockade of j the Hasa ports were not really parallel. A precedent for the first might perhaps be found elsewhere, but it would in Sir A.Ryan's opinion be contrary to all civilized practice to prohibit the carriage of goods, by way of through ship- », ment, to the Hasa Coast under penalty of the ships not being allowed to call at Bahrain or compelled to pay transit dues there. He considered that His Majesty's Government would not be able to justify these extraordinary measures which n constituted King Ibn Baud's main grievance. In replying to the Saudi complaint His Majesty's Government must either deny that they, or the Bahrain Government, were preventing British shipping from making direct shipments to the Hasa coast or they must admit it. He suggested that a possible course.. • •5. course might he to admit that the British India Company were acting under some pressure irom the Bahrain Government and in the light oi their own interests, tut to add that His Male oo^ o Covern encourage the Company to adopt another policy unless a satisfactory general settlement were reached between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. 10 . MR. KBNDBL objected that this might result in an awkward discussion with the Saudi Government as bo the extent to which action could be taken by His Majesty’s Government to facilitate direct shipments, and that such discussion might end in His Majesty’s Government being engaged in more active intervention than they had contemplated. On the main point at issue he added that it seemed unlikely that King Ibn Baud would agree to a conference until he knew whether a blockade were seriously threatened or not. In view of this and also of the irregularity of a blockade policy, he proposed that King Ibn Baud should be approached on the following lines. No blockade would be imposed, on Saudi portsj on tue other hand the bian^it dues were essential to the finances of Bahrain, his Majesty’s Government must, therefore, once again invite the Saudi Government to discuss the general Question of their commercial relations with Bahrain at a conference. If a. satisfactory general settlement were reached at this conference, His Majesty's Government would undertake to see that the transit dues were nor raised above a certain point. This would enable His Majesty's Government to make the proposal for a, conference attractive to the Saudi Government without necessitating J6. necessitatin''-: tlie eniployrnent o± a tlireat of doubtful legitimacy. lie SIR A. RYAN agreed generally. He then further elaborated Mr« Rendel’s suggestion and proposed that the following line should be taken with the Saudi Government on their being once again invited to a. conference at Bahrein:- (a) The Saudi Government should be assured once again that the action of the Bahrain Government in connexion with the 'Ahmedi' incident did not represent a settled policy. (b) As regards the attitude of British shipping towards direct shipments to Kesa., the Saudi Government might be told that Lis Majesty's Government were unable to dictate a. policy to the interests concerned, who naturally followed their own advantage. His Majesty's Government would, however, ensure that the Bahrain Government did not exercise undue pressure. (c) The Bahrain Government were entitled to raise the transit dues. Sir A. Ryan very much doubted, in spite of the renewed representations which had recently been made to them, whether the Saudi Govenment would agree to a conference without receiving beforehand an assurance that in Majesty’s Government did not intend to enforce a. blockade of the Rasa, ports. Such an assurance might nevertheless be confined to the most general terms and it might be hinted to the Saudi Government that, if they proved obdurate, the transit dues might be raised ngeinat them. f7 them, 12. MRo LAITHWAITE suggested that King Ibn Saud might refuse to negotiate under a threat. SIR A. RYAN agreed, hut observed that if King Ibn Saud did decline the proposal for a conference, he might be told that the Bahrain Government must recompense themselves for the lack of any satisfactory commercial arrangement with Saudi Arabia by raising the dues. The question then arose whether any raising of the dues in these or similar circumstances should extend to the levying of dues on those goods which at present pass into Saudi Arabia free as being for the King’s personal use. SIR A. RYAN recommended that goods which were genuinely for King Ibn Saud’s own use should in any case continue to enjoy exemption, since his resentment at the removal of this privilege might do more damage to Anglo-Saudi relations than its abolition could profit Bahrain. MR. LAITHWAITE inclined to the view that, if failure to reach an agreement resulted in an economic war, even King Ibn Saud’s personal stores could not be passed over 0 As it was, he appeared to be receiving under this exemption consignments very much larger than the needs of his household would seem to warrant, e.g. 30,000 bags of rice, and it might be assumed that the surplus went to the tribes. 13. On the main issue MR. LAITHWAITE and COLONEL FOWLE concurred generally in the course proposed by Sir A Ryan. Mr. Laithwaite proposed, however, that the assurance regarding the blockade should only be given if1 if the Saudi Government refused to attend the conference unless they received it c He also preferred that His Majesty’s Government should not specifically undertake to ensure that the Bahrain Government did not bging pressure to bear on the shipping companies* It had already been arranged that the Political .Agent, Bahrain, would lend his assistance in connexion with any discussions at Bahrain. But, if the Saudi Government particularly desired that the negotiations should be tripartite, there would be no objection to arranging for the Political Agent or the Political Resident to be a member of the conference* It seemed, however, better that the Bahrainis and Saudi representatives should, at any rate in the first instance, deal with the matter direct, with the informal assistance of the Political Agent® 14, MR. Rill DEL also agreed to the course proposed^ A threat to raise the transit dues would, in his view, be a legitimate bargaining counter, wherea.s a threat of a blockade would not. 15. MR. LAITK T iAITE in conclusion suggested that it might be possible to say to the Saudi Government that, if they would agree to negotiate at Bahrain, His Majesty’s Government for their part would advise the •Bahrain Government not to exercise for the time being their undoubted sovereign rights and raise the dues* i' A summary of the course of action agreed upon by the meeting was then dictated, v/hich is given below as amended later by Sir A„ Ryan® 1, It is still the policy of His Majesty’s Government2o Government to press for an early discussion of this question at a Saudi-Batoaini conference, to he held at Bahrain, with the assistance of the political authorities, to explore all the issues and endeavour to arrive at a. settlement which would he confirmed in due course through the diplomatic channel« See the 1932 correspondence, the record of Sir Ac Ryan's conversation with Ihn Baud at Taif on Jule 13th last and the record of the conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on September 21st 0 If the Saudi Government now agree to this local conference and a settlement acceptable to the Governments concerned results from it, cadit quaestio. If a, settlement does not result, the ground will be clear for further discussion with the Saudi Government in the course of the general negotiations contemplated after Sir A&lt;. Ryan returns to Jedda. If, as a condition of agreeing to the local conference the Saudi Government press for a statement by His Majesty's Government as to their attitude regarding the imposition of restrictions by Bahrain on direct shipments to the Rasa Coast, Mr. Calvert, or in due course Sir A. Ryan, is authorised to ma.ke a statement on the following lines, using discretion ss to the precise form to be given to it:- (a) The action of the Bahrain authorities at the time of the isolated Ahmedi incident wasS' 10. was en expedient adopted dy them in conditions of urgency and did not represent e considered policy of His Majesty’s Government. (b) Neither His Majesty's Government nor the Bahrain Government have forbidden shipping companies to accept cargo for direct shipment to the Hase coast, under penalty of not being allowed to call at Bahrain, although, in the single case of the Ahmedi, transit duty was claimed. His Majesty's Government cannot in fact issue instructions to shipping companies regarding such matters in normal circumstances. It is for the companies themselves to consider applications for facilities for direct shipment, having regard to all the factors affecting them, including such regulations as may be made by the Bahrain Government in the exercise of their sovereign rights. (c) His Majesty's Government are, however, anxious to promote the removal of all causes of difficulty in connexion with the general question of shipments for Hasa. If the local conference is agreed to end produces favourable results, they will urge the Bahrain Government to refrain from any future action analogous to that taken in the case of the Ahrnedi. (d)11 . (d) it ig orlpj;: to the influence of His r'rjesty’s Government, which wes enerted Btronnly with the Brhrain Government in 1920, thet 3r;idi importers have for meny yerrs enjoyed tne benefit of e very fe' urable rate of transit duty. Mis Majesty 1 s Government cannot, however, ignore the importance of the transit trade to the economic life of Bahrain. While recognising that the fostering of direct trade to the Saudi mainland is a. matter entirely within the rights of the Saudi Government, they must equally recognise that any considerable diversion of trade from its present channels would seriously affect the revenues of Bahrain and would necessarily compel the Bahrain Government to compensate themselves by raising the dues on goods continuing to pass through Bahrain. The interests of Bahrain and Fasa must continue to be interdependent for many years to come and trie case is one for a. mutual a.ccornmodation of those interests. (e) Lis Majesty’s Government consider that this statement should remove any misgiving on tne part of the Saudi Government as to their attitude, which is inspired solely by their desire to promote the desired accommodation of interests, a.s a result12 . of ? free exchenge of views between experts qualified by local knowledge to 8.dvise on the best means of attaining it. 4. If the Saudi Government should not agree to the local conference and its proceedings should nevertheless be delayed by insistence on the Saudi side on the grievances alleged by Ibn Saud. the Political Agent will have authority to moke a statement on the above lines at any stage, where it may seem to him appropriate. 5. The Saudi Government have made a special point of urging that goods consigned to Ibn Saud or his Government should be exempted from transit dues. If the local conference is agreed to, this point will doubtless be raised and it will be necessary to define the scope of any such exemption. If no settlement is arrived at, it may become necessary, not only to raise the dues, but to restrict the exemption or to refuse nay exemption whatsoever, even in the case of goods for Ibn Saud f s personal use. It is left to the discretion of the Legation in Jedda and the Political Agent to include a hint as to the ultimate possibility of a severe restriction of existing exemptions in any statement on the above lines, but care should be taken to avoid any premature pronouncement which might be construed as a threat aimed at Ibn Saud personally.
