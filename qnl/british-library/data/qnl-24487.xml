P art I.—GENERAL SUMMARY. After a tenure of office extending, with only two breaks, over a period of more than eighteen years, Colonel Ross was relieved by Major Talbot on the 26th March last and proceeded to England on two years' furlough. 1.—^OMAN-MUSCAT STATE. The annual report of the Muscat State has been drawn up by Colonel Mockler, and forms Part II of this compilation. The chief events of the year have been the plunder of a caravan in November, by some tribes of the Semail valley, which resulted in the closure of the trade routes from the Sharkiyah for several months, and the destruction by fire of a portion of the Khaboorah bazar in February last; the circumstances of this latter incident are under reference to the Government of India. A new commercial treaty with Muscat was signed towards the close of the last official year. The export returns show that the unsettled state of the country has affect ed trade, for, excluding a larger specie remittance than usual, which swells the total, the value of produce shipped is markedly less than in the previous year. A destructive cyclone in June, accompanied by a high tidal wave, did much damage to the town of Muscat, and many houses are still in ruins. 2.—'OMAN PIRATE COAST. The confederacy between the Chiefs of Pas-ul-Khaimah, Um-ul-Kawain, and Shargah, mentioned in the last report, was still in force at the commence ment of this year, when the three former Chiefs visited Shargah. They were joined by the Chief of Ajman, who was believed to intend taking a more active part than hitherto in the support of the Jowasim against Debay. The Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah, in concert with some of the leading men at Shargah, endeavoured to arrange terms of peace with Debay, the Chief of which had recently sent a declaration of war against Shargah. This, however, was against the wishes of the Chief of Shargah, and the Residency Agent, who had been consulted by them in the matter, was unable to move in it.*11 6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL The Chief of Um-ul-Kawain wrote with a similar object to the Chief of Abu Dhabi to solicit his good offices in negotiating peace, but at first met with an unsatisfactory response ; later on, however, a meeting was arranged between them, when terms were temporarily settled between the contending factions, but not until after a series of border raids on both sides, in which some lives were lost, date-trees cut down, and houses destroyed. Intercourse was not at once resumed, and the claims of the Beni Yas, to which Abu Dhabi and Debay belong, remained unsettled. Later in the year it was reported that the Chief of Debay had remonstrated with his ally Zaid-bin-Khalifah, of Abu Dhabi, for his lukewarmness in procuring a settlement of the former's claims against Shargah, and that Shaikh Zaid had pledged himself to march against Shargah and compel their adjustment oy force of arms. Towards the end of January last both Chiefs were reported to be collect ing a force for the purpose, but no decisive action was taken. Amongst minor disturbances may be mentioned a raid on Ras-ul-Khaimah by the Sahu tribe, who were, however, repulsed with a loss of eleven men, while only one of the defenders was killed. The Beni Harar, whose villages were annexed some years ago by Shaikh Zaid -bin-Khalifah, retook them towards the end of 1890, with the help of the Nairn tribe, who sent emissaries to the confederate Chiefs on the coast to enlist their support in the event of their being punished by the Abu Dhabi Chief. Early this year the Sultan of Muscat suggested that they might be reached by an expedition to the Batineh, and the Chief of Debay, whose help had been solicited by the Chief of Abu Dhabi, was preparing an expedition for action in that direction when it had to be abandoned in consequence of rumours of a formidable raid by Jasim-bin-Thani's brother. Early in March last a raid was made by some of the Awamir tribe on a party of camel-tenders belonging to Abu Dhabi, two of whom were killed and forty camels were carried off. The gangs were overtaken and by some stratagem brought to Abu Dhabi, where they were imprisoned. Amongst them was a man of the Nairn tribe, and on application for his release being refused, the tribe decided on hostilities against Abu Dhabi and applied for assistance to the Chiefs of Shargah and Ajman, while the Chiefs of Abu Dhabi and Debay were reported to have taken the field and to be busy collecting troops. Nothing serious, however, resulted, and although the relations between the ' trucial' Chiefs continued to be thus unsatisfactory, no decided advantage seems to have been gained by one over the other, and no breach of treaty relations with the British Govern ment occurred. The pearl-fishing was only moderately successful this year, and the demand for pearls fell off owing to the dulness of the Indian market. Many divers from the Arab coast had gone to Ceylon the previous year, and they reported better results there than at the Red Sea fisheries, the result being that their example was followed by a number of others this year. Locusts appeared at Shargah in May 1890, and did much damage to the date gardens and other cultivation. Influenza was prevalent there in the spring, and several deaths occurred from it. On the 11th January last a heavy storm passed over the coast and did much damage at Shargah, where numbers of houses were unroofed, some 600 date-trees were blown down, and 10 beached boats were destroyed. In a heavy storm at ljm-ul-Kaw T ain on the 1st February two boats were wrecked, in one of which was a case containing 25 Martini-Henry rifles for the Chief.residency and muscat political agency pgr 1890-91. 3.—BAHRAIN.

Matters are as far as ever from being arranged between Shaikh Jasim-bin- Thani aud the Chief of Abu Dhabi, and mutual raids, in which the advantage seems to have rested with Shaikh Jasim, occurred at intervals throughout the yeai , Shaikh Jasim s pieparations for action appear to have been on a lor^er scale than usual, and he was reported to have sent a raiding party of three hundred and fifty men towards 'Oman under his brother and son. In May it was reported that the Mutasarif of El-Hasa had written to Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab, declaring his intention of appointing him Gov- ernor of Zobara, and several other projects were attributed to the Mutasarif, acting under orders from Constantinople. Amongst these were the appoint ment of Mudirs, and the erection of buildings at Zobara and Odeid; the nomina tion of a deputy to Jasim-bin-Thani, Kaim-makam of Katr, on the plea of his frequent absences, and in the hope of establishing more control over El-Katr ; the rebuilding of the Bereymi and Bel'Alat forts, and the construction of a large mosque at Ojair; also, the organization of a force of 600 police, mounted on camels, to keep in check the Bedouins, the despatch of two steamers to run between Katr and Ojair and Katif, the appointment of a harbour master at Katr to levy dues on native craft, and the stationing there of a force of cavalry and infantry. It was also reported that the Turks intended establishing a custom-house at El-Bidaa, and a Government building was to be erected; taxes were also to be levied on divers and pearl merchants. Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab declined the offer of the Governorship of Zobara, but in September it was reported that Asif Beg, Khalaf Effendi, and Muhammad Beg had been nominated at Busrah as Mudirs of Zobara and Odeid and assistant to the Kaim-makam of Katr respectively. These proceedings were made the subject of a reference to the Government of India. Jasim-bin-Thani is believed to be dissatisfied with the turn affairs have taken, and to resent the action of the Turkish authorities. Towards the close of the year Akif Pasha, Mutasarif of Hasa, to whose incentive these attempts to extend Turkish influence and jurisdiction were ascribed, was compelled by ill- health to leave El-Hasa, and is said to have since died on his way home. At the end of January last the officials mentioned above as having been appointed to Odeid, Zobara, and Katr arrived at Bahrein, and were said to intend proceeding first to El-Bidaa to deliver certain orders to Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani regarding the building of forts at the two former places. The transfer of Akif Pasha however delayed the departure of these officials for their posts, for which, by the latest accounts, they had not yet left.ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL 5.—NEJD AND EL-HASA. The schemes of Akif Pasha were said to have included the control of Nejd and 'Oman but the project was considered by the Turkish Government as being too large as regards Nejd, though deserving of consideration both as regards 'Oman and Bahrein. The accounts from Nejd would seem to indicate that during the year a more serious attempt than usual was made by Abdur Rahman bin Feysal to shake the power of Ibn-ur -Rashid, and Riadh was captured by the Al-Saud. It was soon besieged by Ibn-ur-Rashid and bombarded, but with no distinct effect; eventually peace was concluded between him and the Al-Saud. By its terms Riadh remained in the hands of the Al-Saud, who ceded to Ibn-ur- Eashid, Washam and Sedeyyir, with their dependencies. The fort of Khorj, which the Al-Saud failed to take, was placed in charge of one of Ibn-ur- Bashid's officers. Both parties wrote to the Mutasanf of El-Hasa-Ibn-ur- Rashid, to denounce Abdur Rahman as meditating an attack on El-Hasa, and the latter, recounting the usurpations and ruthless tyranny of his adversary, and professing his obedience to the Turkish authorities, who were disposed to listen favourably to him. Later intelligence in the early part of this year was to the effect that Ibn-ur-Rashid had succeeded in recapturing Riadh. He was not so successful in a contest with the people of Kassim, who, after two defeats, were said to have inflicted severe loss on him in an action fought early in February. The Mutasarif was apparently desirous of coming to terms with the Bedouins, who had been engaged in robberies of caravans, and of restoring to them the subsidy paid by the Turkish Government, but the plunder of a caravan of two hundred camels, laden with dates, by the Al-Murrah, Beni Hajat and other tribes, led to its withdrawal and the execution of several camel-drivers. 6.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. The Nizam-us-Sultaneh was replaced by Haji Ghulam Hussein Khan, ' Shehab-ul-Mulk,' as Governor of Persian Arabistan in March this year. Trade on the Karun has not increased as rapidly as might have been expected, the chief difficulties being connected with imperfect arrangements for the storage of goods, and for the levy of duty at the port of destination on those for the interior. This latter impediment to the growth of a through traffic has now been removed, and it is hoped that there will be sufficient inducement to British ships to call in larger numbers than hitherto at Mohammerah. A company has been formed under the direction of the Muin-ut-Tujjar of Busbire to work the Upper Karun, and the Nasiri, a steam launch 63ft. long, has been placed by the company on the Lower Karun to run in connection with the Shushan above Ahwaz. The Muiz-us-Sultaneh was confirmed in the Chiefship of Mohammerah for another year. He is believed to have entered into partnership with the Muin-ut-Tujjar, and would have joined the Nizam-us-Sultaneh in constructing the necessary buildings for warehouses, &amp;c., had the latter been retained in office in Arabistan. A Vice-Consul was appointed to Mohammerah in the autumn of last year y and Mr. W. McDouall, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, was selected as the first incumbent of the post. 7.—rARS AND PERSIAN COAST. There has been no change in the Government of Fars during the past year, and the province is still administered by His Royal Highness the Motamid -ud- Dowlah, with Haji Nasir-ul-Mulk as his Pishkar.residency and muscat political agency for 1890-91. 9 His Excellency the Saad-ul-Mulk continued in office as Governor of Bushire and the Persian ports and islands. Shahzada Nowzer Mirza was appointed Governor of Behbahan. Muhammad Hasan Khan Sirteep continued to he Governor of Dashti, Dashtistan, and Tangistan, and no changes were made in the charge of Kankari Bowanat, and Kazeran. The Il-Begi of the Kashkai tribes was conferred on Abdulla Khan, eldest son of Darab Khan, who was detained at Shiraz. A number of families of the Baharloo clan, whose Chief, Hussain Khan, was for some time imprisoned at Shiraz, but afterwards escaped, were reported to have fled to Mazanderan to escape the exactions of the Kawam-ul-Mulk. This example was followed by Asad-ullah-Khan, one of the Ketkodas of the Arab tribes, who, with his following, retired to Yezd. The sons of Fath Ali Khan, Deputy Governor of Lar, rebelled against their father, and seized the forts of Jerash and Parweeza, but after some resistance surrendered to him. In Apiil, last year, an embargo was placed on the exportation of grain, but, these crops having proved to be good, the interdict was shortly afterwards removed. The opium crops in Ears were poor this year; locusts also appeared in vari ous places and did considerable damage. There were several severe shocks of earthquake, and atJahrum some thirty lives were lost. Kamarij, Khisht, and Easa were also visited by several shocks, but no great damage was done. In November Captain Kmentt, of the Austrian Army, with two Austrian assistants and four workmen from Galicia, arrived to prospect for petroleum at Daltki, in the Geesakun hills, on behalf of the Persian Bank Mining Eights Corporation. So far the experiment has not been successful; indications of oil have been found, but not in any quantity, while the workings have been flooded with water. 8.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. Zein-ul-Abidin Khan was appointed Governor of Baluchistan by His Royal Highness the Prince Governor of Kerman. In the spring of this year His Eoyal Highness marched into the lately disturbed districts of Persian Baluchistan, and punished the ring-leaders in the revolt which had occurred during the absence of His Majesty the Shah in England. Several were executed and others imprisoned ; their relations, with a number of followers, afterwards came to Jask, and a disturbance seemed possible; but they were quieted by a re-assuring telegram from the Persian Government. Hussein Khan Baharloo, on his escape from Shiraz, fled to Kerman, and, on his request for pardon being refused, joined another political refugee. Shah Murad Khan, at the fort of Mazeejan. He was afterwards captured and brought back to Shiraz. Murad Asadullah Khan Arab lost two sons in a raid on certain villages in the district of Lassa, whereupon he seized and executed a number of the headmen and marched on Kerman, accompanied by some eight hundred Arab families. He was, however, induced to return to Darab without having caused any serious disturbance. 9.—SLAVE TRAFFIC. The traffic in raw slaves mentioned in last year's report continued in un abated vigour, and numerous importations into the Persian and Arabian ports are believed to have taken place. A circular letter was addressed to the truci- al Chiefs, reminding them of their engagement in this respect; as usual, the Beni Jabar and other Bedouin tribes on the Batineh coast were the principal b10 administration report of the persian gulf political offenders. An attempt to introduce twenty-five slaves into Muscat on a Prencli mail steamer from Aden to Karachi was enquired into at Muscat, and six Arabs, shown to have been implicated in the matter, were imprisoned by the Sultan. The letter to the trucial Chiefs referred to above was followed by the discovery and release of several Africans in captivity on the Pirate coast. Two men swam to the steamer Calder at Lingah and claimed protection as British subjects from Aden; they also p^ave information regarding the whereabouts of three other Africans in captivity on the Arab coast. One of these has been since released; the other two are known to be at Hinjam, and their release will be insisted on. On the Persian side the Governor of Bushire, in response to a request from the Resident, issued orders forbidding the traffic, which was most brisk at Charak and Kais, the inhabitants of which refused to allow the Deputy Gover nor of Lin gah to make any enquiries. The question of the increasing frequency of the importation of raw slaves into the countries bordering on the Persian Gulf has been brought to the notice of Government. Many of the 'Omani boats are said to fly the French flag and carry French papers, under cover of which they are able to practise their trade in slaves with impunity, and various suggestions for effectually putting a stop to the traflic have been made, which will doubtless receive consideration. 10.—ROYAL NAVY VESSELS. H.M.S. Mariner left the Gulf in the middle of June and was relieved at Muscat on the 10th September by H.M.S. Sphinx. Up to that date Com- mander Arbuthnot was Senior Naval Officer. He was succeeded by Com mander Groome, and, on the latter officer s promotion, he was succeeded by Commander Hart Dyke. 11.—POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS. Besides the change in the office of E-esident, mentioned at the beginning of this lepoit, that of First Assistant was filled by Lieutenant Stratton until his transfer to Bussorah in March 1890. Captain Chenevix-Trench relieved Mr. G. Lucas, who had held temporary charge, on the 15th August, and was suc ceeded by Lieutenant C. A. Kemball on the 26th March 1891. Surgeon-Major D. K. Ross returned to his post of Residency Surgeon on the 28th Apiil, his locum tsnens i Dr. T. Ffrench-Mullen, proceeding to India, 12.—OBSERVATORY. The results of the daily observations are embodied in a tabular statement, mar'e Appendix C. Iheie was an exceptionally good rainfall in the winter, and but lor the ravages of locusts in some parts, the crops would have been excellent. A. C. TALBOT, JUajor^ Bushire ; Officiating Resident, The 20th July 1891,RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1890-91. 15 P ART II. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY AND CONSULATE EOR THE YEAR 1890-91. The first event of importance which occurred during the official year Political. under report was the departure of His Highness Sa yy id Abdul Aziz (uncle of His Highness Sayyid Peysal) from 'Oman in April: his many attempts to obtain the throne of Muscat during the last fifteen years are well known to Government. It is to be sup posed that, himself destitute of the funds requisite for a serious undertakino-? and finding that for the time being the people of 'Oman were unwilling to help him at their own expense to oust a Sultan whose rule was practically unfelt for one whom they knew by former experience would expect and endeavour to enforce obedience to his mandates, he considered it better to endeavour to ameliorate his circumstances, if possible, in other directions, and accordingly in April proceeded to Abu Dhabi to his friend Shaikh Zaid-bin- Khalifah and thence to Bushire, where he interviewed the Resident, Colonel Ross, and then went to Bombay, where he still is. His family are, however, in 'Oman and were invited by His Highness Sayyid Peysal to come to Muscat, but refused, as might have been expected. During the same month the Resident at Bushire came to Muscat in Her Majesty's I. M. Ship Lawrence, and communicated to His Highness Sayyid Peysal the recognition by the British Government of His Highness as Sultan of Muscat. Hamud-ab-Jahafi (Yah Wahiba), who had been raiding for some time past in the Batina, returned to the Sharkiyah. Rear Admiral Preemantle also visited Muscat in his Plagship the Boadicea on his way to Bushire. In May His Highness Sayyid Peysal, with his brothers, went to Soor in the Sultanee, and arranged matters between the tribes in the vicinity. In June a cyclonic storm visited Muscat and the neighbouring region, causing much damage to date plantations, native shipping, and the town of Muscat, with the loss of many lives. Pighting also took place in the Wadi Beni Ghafir between the tribes inhabiting it, in which there was some loss of life. A settlement was, however, made between them by Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis, of Rostak. In September a small party from the Sharkiyah attacked some of the Ghafir people near Jemmah, in the Semail valley, and killed three of the Yaara- bah, and wounded one of the Beni Harras, in retaliation for the murder by one of the Beni Harras of a Sharkiyah man under his protection, which matter having been referred by His Highness Sayyid Peysal to Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali for settlement, by whom the Beni Harras were granted very favourable terms, which were repudiated by the Sharkiyah people in the manner above described. His Highness' abstention from intervention on their behalf was looked on by the Semail valley people as a slight and grievance, and gave rise to much trouble later on. In October a collision occurred between the Awamir and Beni Riyam, which was subsequently arranged by Shaikh Hameid-bin-Nasir, of the Beni Ghafir. Some complaints of assault were made by British subjects at Soor during this month.20 administration report of the P ersian gulp political In November a khafila of eighty camels, laden principally with goods be- longing to the Harth tribe of the Sharkiyah, was attacked and looted by a party composed of members from various tribes of the Semail valley, principally Beni Jabir, Beni Harras, and Yaarabah, the khafila was under protection of a man of the Masakirah (Ghafri) tribe named Hameid-bin-Salim (nicknamed Kurta), which therefore became involved. Sayyid Nasir-bin-Muhammad, a man of weight, was sent by His Highness Sayyid Feysal to Tow to get back the looted property, but he narrowly escaped being fired on and returned discom fited. Subsequently the Maskarah Kafir Kurta, with a paity of some twenty men, closed the roads leading from the Sharkiyah, committing murders almost within sight of the walls of jVIattrah and Muscat, neaily paralysing trade up to the end of the official year. A truce was made by Bashid -bin-Uzeiyez between the Rahbiyeen Midabi- yeen and Ab-Waheebah for one year. In February 1891 Shaikh Hamud-bin-Majid of the Beni-bin-Ali (Razik section) was treacherously murdered by a relation of Shaikh \ussuf-bin-Ali (Sinadah section), whom Hamud had killed in 1887; a truce w^as effected between the parties by the mediation of Sayyid Nasir -bin-Mahomed (Ab-bu-Sadi). In the same month the bazaar of Khaboorah was destroyed by fire, the losses sustained by the British merchants amounting to some $35,000. The fire was undoubtedly lit by members of the Howamid section of the Howasinah tribe instigated thereto by the Wall of Sahar, w r hose declared policy in reference to that tribe received His Highness Sayyid Feysal's approval. On 19th March 1891 a new Commercial Treaty with the British Govern ment was signed by His Highness Sayyid Eeysal. In May Her Majesty's Ship Cossack brought for adjudication the case of a dhow captured by her near Eas-Gameilal^ and destroyed after her crew had fired on the ship's boats: the dhow was condemned. I d September twenty-five African slaves arrived at Muscat in the British India Steam Navigation Company's Steamer Kistna from Karachi in charge of some Arabs. They were, after enquiry by the ilcting Political Agent, liberated with the assent of the Sultan and sent to Bombay; their release, however, called forth strong remonstrance from Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali to His Highness Sayyid Feysal. During this month the Resident at Bushire made a representation to the Political Agent regarding the wholesale importation of slaves into the Persian Gulf from Soor and the Batineh coast. During the year thirty-two fugitive slaves taking refuge at this Consulate were freed under the Treaty of 1873. The following men-of-war visited Muscat during the year. Her Majesty's Navy ships Boadicea^ Grifin, Cossack, Mariner, and Sphinx. Surgeon-Major A. S. G.

Slave trade.HESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR 1890-91. P ART III.—REPORT ON THE TRADE OF SOUTH PERSIA EOR THE YEAR 1890. The tiacle of South Persia during the year 1890 has not been so satisfactory as that of the pievious year. Two causes have contributed to this somewhat unfavouiable lesult. A short harvest, owing to late and scanty rainfall, and the violent fluctuations in the price of silver, resulting from legislation in the United States. Imports. Piece-goods were, it is true, imported in large quantities, and the north of Persia, especially the markets at Tehran and Yezd, piece-goods. appear to show increased demand, but, as regards the south of Persia at least, the results have been unfavourable, not to say disastrous. In the pre vious year there were indications of a glut in the markets and continued large importations of cotton goods served to increase this evil. The advance in silver caused stocks to be pressed heavily for sale, and the Persian dealers, who thought they had bought at cheap rates, found goods offered at still lower rates falling week by week. The result in a market where credit is the rule and where native buyers are in general without reserves was inevitable, that is to say, cancellation of engagements became frequent and in many instances native dealers became insolvent. The demand has heretofore been principally for grey Mexicans and shirt ings, white shirtings, mulls and jacconets, there being little sale in the south for mors expensive goods. Imports of sugar were on an increased scale, and in excess of demand, leading to low prices and heavy losses. German loafsugar is not successful, and will probably be abandoned in favour of the Erench article. Erench and German granulated sugars, mostly beet, compete successfully with Mauritius sugars, being imported at somewhat lower rates. The European sugars are imported to Persian ports in British steamers direct from London. Co ^ er Copper was imported in less quantity than in the previous year, owing to high prices ruling in Europe. Exports. The quantity of grain exported was less than in 1888 and 1889. Advance of silver quite stopped business for a time, prices in Persia not following that movement. In the early autumn home prices improved, and shipments were resumed and kept up steadily, though in small quantities, until the close of the year. The crop of opium was the largest on record, the total export from Bushire being 4,817 cases, of which 306 went to London and the remainder to Hong-Kong. The China market was, however, over-stocked, so that prices were too low to allow of profits, and in some cases heavy losses were experienced. The new American tariff has affected the demand in London, and it may be expected that growers will realize only lower prices in the ensuing season. Tobacco. Exporters have suffered losses in this article.18 ADMINISTKATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Owing to deficiency of grass in spring the wool clip was but poor in quantity and quality, but what was exported to London sold well. In cotton the exportation was unsatisfactory. The large American crop reduced home prices, whilst the rise in the runee Cotton. _ , . . n 1 kept Bombay p rices low, and shippers from Persia had to face heavy losses. Some trials have been made in shipping hydraulic pressed bales direct to London instead of, as usual, to Bombay, to be mixed with other qualities. It is thought that direct shipments to England will prove successful. A considerable trade was done in sweet-almonds, and it is expected that, A]mo) da with the opening of the new route connecting Sul- tanabad, Barojird, and Kermanshah with the sea, this trade will be considerably developed. Freightg Freights to England varied from 22s.6d. to 32s.6^. per ton. Exchange declined from krans 36 in the beginning of the year to krans 29 Exchange&lt; per pound sterling, and subsequently recovered to krans 3^. The Imperial Bank of Persia, having arranged with the New Oriental Bankg Bank Corporation to withdraw from Persia, secured the whole field for itself, and has opened branches in the most important centres of commerce. The first annual report has been encouraging and indicates favourable prospects. The mining rights of the bank have been sold to the Persian Bank Mining Rights Association, and this company has commenced work in the south. The mountains east of Bushire called the Gesikoon range were examined at a place called Naristan for coal but unsuccessfully. Machinery has been set up at Dalike to bore for petroleum. The plant has the latest improvement, and is suitable for boring to a depth of over 1,000 feet. The direction is entrusted to an able and energetic Austrian officer, with much experience of such work in Galicia, and if the success which is hoped for attends the interprise, it will be a source of much prosperity to the country, and particularly to the port of Bushire. Another company has acquired a tobacco monopoly for all Persia, and it is expected operations will be commenced from the approaching ' Nowroz,' Persian new year, which falls on 21st March. This concession will probably not be regarded with a favourable eye at first, and it will require tact and skill to overcome the difficulties which will be experienced in the working of details, but it is expected to be a remunerative undertaking.

The statistics of trade for the past year, as received from the Customs farmer, are shown in the accompanying returns. They are merely approximate and show a slight increase in the value of exports, and a small decrease in imports. Dates, cotton fabrics, pearls, salt and fruit contributed to the increase; the decrease in imports was principally in coffee, wheat, blue cloth, twist from India, cotton, salt from Persian Gulf, pearls from South Arabia, and sugar from Mauritius ; the value of imports from India, however, has improved by $50,000 over the previous year, chiefly in rice, sugar, oils, and silk goods ; there is considerable falling off in imports from other countries, excepting in silk goods from Persia, which show an improvement of $10,000. The customs were bought by Sett Rattonsee Parsotum for $115,000. E. MOCKLER, Colonel, M. B.

M0CKIEK&gt;' Trade and Commerce, The town of Mohammerah lias at present little export trade, there being no resident merchants of any importance (with the exception of a branch of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, of London). The resident merchants are simply for warding agents to firms up-conntry or at the town of Koweit in Turkish Arabia. The export trade of the province—wheat, oil seeds, wool, and cotton is chiefly in the hands of Bussorah merchants, who purchase produce up to the Karun and convey it to Bussorah for sale or export. Dates, which are grown in large quantities, are chiefly exported to India in native boats, which come up in the season to purchase them. There are a certain number of mules and horses exported to India; but there being no restriction now on export of horses from Turkey, only those from Koweit (by native boat and Bahmisher river) and a few from interior of Persia arrive for shipment. There are some thirty shopkeepers who import piece-goods from Bombay through one or other of local merchants. About ten bales are opened weekly to supply shops and petty traders from Howizeh, principally cheap kinds of shirt ings and chintz, some of Indian, but principally of English manufacture. Exports, as far as I have been able to ascertain, were as follows :— To Great Britain. £ £ Wheat , 311 tons 1,274 Simsira . 399 cwts. 153 Dates . 2^5 tons . . 2,000 T otal 3,427 3,427 To France. £ Simsim , 313 cwt. « 131 131 To India. £ Dates 5,122 tons 25,757 Simsim 3,698 cwts. 1,552 Linseed 1,106 cwts. . 464 Wool 2,080 bales 15,757 Cotton 90 cwts. , 138 Reeds 320 bundles . * 50 Bu^loss 460 „ 140 Horses 465 3,720 Mules 196 1,960 49,538 Total 49,588 53,096 The imports by a steamer are as follows, and in addition there is good deal of Russian kerosine oil and a few other articles imported by native boats, and by«l)e e 59,500 43,380 7,5«0 1,400 4,330 Mil 10,015 l,ll)0 121 4,000 2,370 49 437 51 59 144,615 144 1 ,526 24 waH or nch.'

The currency is Persian ; but the rupee is practically current at rate of ElOO to 250 krans. The Turkish lira is taken at about 32 krans. The above lists are calculated at 33 krans to the pound sterling. Shipping and Navigation. The steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company called weekly to discharge cargo on their return from Basrah, and from the 9th November they commenced calling on way up river to land mails and passengers regularly, and cargo when it suits their convenience. The steamers of the Bombay and Per sian Gulf Steam Navigation Company also called regularly to discharge cargo on the way from Bussorah about once a month. The grain shipped for Europe was shipped outside the bar of Shat-el-Arab, being conveyed from here in lighters. In the river the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (of which Messrs. Lynch are agents) run a steamer fortnightly to Ahwaz in con nection with one running thence to Shushtar. The Nasery (a Persian) com pany imported a steam launch on 2nd November, which runs to Ahwaz, towing two lighters alongside and taking about 25 tons of cargo. Seven Indian baglas, under British flag, called at port during the date season, before this Vice Consulate was opened. The number of baglas under other flags I have been unable to ascertain. Agriculture. A large amount of wheat is grown on the Karun, and much more could be grown. A certain amount of oil seeds, flax, and roses is also grown; from the latter good rose-water is made, chiefly on the island of Khedr, Dates are the principal crop in the immediate neighbourhood of the town. Industries. A coarse woollen cloth is made for local consumption throughout the district. Dyeing and tanning are carried on in the town, and some good silver work is done by the Sabaen community, of whom there are about thirty families in the district. JPuhlic Works. During the year the buildings commenced by Persian Government pre viously at the junction of the Karun and Shat-el-Arab, now called Bunder Saheb Kerani' {vis., Government house, landing-place and stores), were completed, and a telegraph office built, also a battery and an infantry barrack on the60 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN gtjlf POLITICAL RESIDENCY, &amp;c opposite side of the Karun. The landing-stage is too far from low water mark to be of much use. It can however be used by river steamers, by anchor- ing a lighter between the steamer and landing stage to form a bridge. The telegraph line has been completed between Dizful, Shustar, and Ahwaz, and is now working between Ahwaz and Shustar, but communication is seldom perfect between Dizful and Tehran. At Ahwaz the line will have to cross the river and will then be brought to Mohammerah. The Nasery Company have imported a light steel tramway from England which is being laid at Ahwaz to convey cargo across the rapids. General, The custom-house has hardly as yet been reduced to a system, and is a drawback to the carrying trade of the river as far as goods owned by Persian subjects is concerned, they being liable to dues at each place they pass through and consequently goods for places beyond Shustar are sent by caravan direct from Mohammerah in spite of advantages of steam conveyance by river. It is expected that these matters will be satisfactorily settled after March next. Mohammerah; ISth June 1891. W.
