S. About 1840 the Ibn Raehid family created the Shamnar State of Hail under the nominal suzerainty of the Wahabi State of the Ibn Sa^d family, which had been weakened by Egyptian intervention in the Arabian penin sular, In 1891 the Ibn Raohid family, after breaking a big tribal combination against them became practically supreme in Majd until 1902, when the present Ibn Sa'ud, who had been an exile in Kuwait, took Riyadh by a sudden strategm and recovered the southern provinces of Hajd. Early in 1913 he captured the Hasa province from the Turks and accepted from them the title of Vali of Uajd, In 1914 he declared himself on the side of the Allies and against the Turks and fought some what feebly against Ibn Bashid during the whole war, receiving large subsidies from His Britannic Majesty's Government, The defeat of Turkey in 1918 increased his power and weakened that of Ibn Hashid. Throughout 1921 he fought Ibn Rashid and finally took Hail in Hovember of that year. In 1922 he claimed suzerainty over the 'Iraq Anaizah and in March 1922 permitted an attack upon the 'Iraq desert camel corps and shepherd tribes-m Z m trltee. In the eaaie year he atsorted Jauf and in tue spring of 1923 advanced to some outlying districts of the Hijaz. in September 1924 he took Taif, the summer capital of the Hijas and in October 1924 Mecca, In 1925 he established suzerainty over Asir and in December 1925 he took Medina and Jiddah, the latter after a long s&lt;%e, 3. i eanwhile, in 192\, progressire pressure had been brought to bear on Ibn Sa'ud to control the Akhwan tribes and especially the Mutair under Faisal al Dawish and to prevent their raiding into »Iraq. This ®.used great 'friction with the tribes and in iiay 192^ Faisal al Dawish of the Mutair, Ibn Humaid of the Ataibah and Dhaidan ibn Hithlain of the Ajman met and swore a defensive alliance against Ibn Sa'ud. Since then his position has never been very secure and the declaration by these three great tribes of a jihad against all non-Akhwan persons is only the culmination of a movement which has been in progress for nearly three years. It is a natural consequence of Ibn Sa'ud's having found himself confronted by the walls of settled frontiers and by the restrictions of treaties after an uninterrupted series of conquests lasting for 15 years. As soon as he had to pause and consolidate and forbid raids, his power waned, because it has been nourished only on fanaticfsm and plunder. I doubt whether this weakening of hie influence was seriously, if at all, hastened by the intervention of the British Air Force in the Mutair 1 territory, which was indeed occasioned by the loss of his control over the Mutair, 4, The best that can now be hoped for is that the Harb tribe will cling to Ibn Sa'ud and that he will oppose in arms the three tribes of the Mutair, Ataibah and Ajman under Ibn Dawish and his associates. It is more■m ** y more likely that he will be forced to join Ihn Dawiah with the Harb and will become a complaisant ally, whifce remaining mominally suzerain. In that event we must expect very big forces numbering to thirty or forty thousand to swoop down on any weak points of the peri- meter of Central Arabia and the earliest point of attack I S3 'W 4. . ur4j««. 1 T A.— . • - ■■ great severity and the approaching pilgrimage will pre sumably become impossible♦ 5« We may assume that the Hoyal Air Force will be able to cope with any conceivable attack on r Iraq f though three or four consecutive days of gales and bad visi bility may at any time throw them out of gear and make the unheralded approach of a large force possible^ But we cannot hope to abolish the Akhwan threat by this means. The only chance of repeating in the twentieth century, the collapse of the Wahabi power which Mehemet Ali of Egypt brought about by military penetration at the beginning of the nineteenth century /tfeems to be a complete blockade by sea* Central Arabia cannot feed itself and if the Akhwan tribes starve within a ring fence and cannot burst out! they will in the end be forced to fight among themselves for the food remaining inside. Then will come the opportunity for Ibn Sa'ud or some other sane person to recover control. Until that point is reached^ somewhat expensive measures of defence and reprisal all along the outside of the ring fence will be needed* 6# If the Akhwan turn more fanatical than ever and prevent the pilgrimage, there is reason to suppose that Indian Moslem sentiment will be opposed to a blockade even of the Hijaz ports, (Id) H # D # 25/11/28, TToProm Telegram Code Residentf Bushire To C.C., Henjam 512 Ho.

Ihn Saud is gratified hy the friendly spirit evinced hy His Majesty's Government hut regrets that owing to change in situation adduced hy precipitative action on uhe part of British and Iraq, officials he cannot now accept the invitation to meet the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf. He fears that if British officials con- -tmue support to anti-Hejd policy of the Sharifs the main- -tenance of order and of friendly relations between himself and His Majesty's Government will become increasingly diff icult. He states that the Uquair protocol was only signed by him on the understanding that wefcLs frequented by his tribesmen should be free of access and that no building should be gxs.permitted. He protests that while he has killed many of his own tribesmen^guilty of raiding into Iraq and Trans- -Jordania, raiders from those countries into Iraq (Hejd ?•) have escaped punishment. He had restrained the people of Hejd and discountenanced the acts of Faisal al Dawish. He IHe had delayed sending out expedition against latter until tie could and agreement with. Iraq, that escaping raiders should not he harboured. The situation had improved when he was threatened that British aircraft would punish his subjects within his own territory. He did not fail to warn Iraq, of the consequences: aeroplanes have since dropped proclamations and homhs on Rejd soil. This act is a breach of his independence. it has caused death of innocent persons, re-inflamed Hejd passions and placed him in an impossible position. It has dealt a real blow at his friendly relations with Great Britain. The respons- -Ibility rests on Iraq, and British officials. Th'e fsars of ITeJd are further increased by news of building at MUDA- -¥ARA. in undelimited area. Ibn Saud protests against (1) breach of Uq.air protocol (2) incitement of Nejd tribes by Iraq, offic- -ials to rebel (3) crossing of his frontier by aeroplanes and attacking of innocent persons (4) building of fort at Ibn Saud appeals to His Majesty's Gov- -emment as his sincere friends to careful point t0 1118 and to every endeavour to eradic -ate the seeds of pursuing Sharif anti-Saud policy by officials in Iraq, and Trans-Jordan.

Please refer to telegram No. 11 from British Consul, Jeddah ,to Foreign Office. The fact that Ihn Saud should leave Hiadh and go to Mecca would, as Consul states, normally he read as a sign that the King was confident in improvement of situation. On this occasion I do not think that it can he so read. Evidence before us suggests the following. Ihn Saud is unquestionably still head of his own house ( and in the opinion of the Shaikhs of Bahrain would he even without the doubtful tribes) but there are strong units which he cannot control on certain points in which he also has sympathy with them, and one of these points is the Iraqt and general frontier question, in which is included our aeroplane action. We have news from three different quarters that the Ataibeh are out. on the raid. The latest x'eport is that they have eleven banners out or several thousand men and that Dawish is to meet Ibn Humaid at Artawiyah. It is no good for the moment our con- -sidering the obvious justice of our claims regarding the frontier wells. Ibn Saud is confronted not with the justicejustice of the ease tut with the view held 'by his tribes and to this is added his own feeling against the Sharif ruler of Iraq, and the perhaps unavoidahle idea that the Sharif ruler has the ear of the British officials at his court. Thus while he has to ride/ the wave he is apparently not sorry to have the excuse that he cannot control a movement which will show his strength on the frontiers of Trans-Jordania and Iraq, and which will demonstrate the danger of a rising which he can us N e as a political argument. Thus his move to Mecca is possibly to get a meeting with someone from London to whom amongst other points he will reiterate his complaints that the whole trouble has heen Drought about by what he maintains is the incorrect attitude of Iraa. Our attack across the frontier has enabled him in his letters to shelve the quest- -ion of the attack on Busaiyah and to drag a red herring of our action against the treaties. It may even be said that he has gone to Mecca sonner than he intended to avoid the constant press- -ure of his tribes to join openly with them. He desires to keep in with Great Britain but he must keep in with his tribes. To do both is at the moment a difficult pro- -position but one which in the long run he can probably con- 1 -trol since Bedouin warfare unless held together from out- -side is apt to peter out. In the meantime we cannot relax our defence measures for we are in greater danger of raids than we were but we can hope the danger will not be maintained since without ammunition from Ibn Saud the tribes cannot continue attacks for long on a big scale. fiSSIDMT.Telegram p.

No. 46-S Eeference telegrams Nos. 31 and 32 from Political Resident, Bushire, dated February 20th. Letters from Ihn Saud summarised therein have now heen received here. It is clear from them that what has annoyed him, and according to his account , upset his trihes, is homhastic speech of Jafar Pasha he- -fore he resigned, and announcement to Iraq.

V 290 of March 3rd to me repeating the despatch Sa of note to Ihn Saud on February 26th from Bahrain, Hafiz fahhah says mere suspension of operations will not he enough for Ihn Saud to restrain trihes. Nejd tribesmen have, accoifcding to Hafiz Wahhah, accused Bin Saud of inciting the British offensive against Nejd. He earnestly reiterates his previous suggestion viz. that His Majesty's Government should give Bin Saud a written assurance that if peace is restored and punishment inflicted hy him the fort of Busaiyah will he demolished. An assurance would also he necessary that if Ihn baud takes punitive action against tribesmen and any of them fly to Irag_ or Kuwait we will surrender the fugitives to him. With these two written assurances Hafiz 'STahha thinks Bin Saud could get tribesmen under control and chastise FaisiLl al Dawish and his followers. Hafia V/ahbah lays stress on urgency of action in the above sense. if they delay it may become impracticible. I have no sufficient local data to judge whether the two above mentioned assurances would indeed enable ibn Saud to recover control over the tribes- -men^ and punish the guilty. I can only estimate the situationsituation as viewed from Cairo• But if there is a fair chance that such would he the result tiiExsL of these assur- -ances I think they should he considered. From telegram I have received from Political Eesident, Persian Gulf, it wouM appear that gravity of situation has already decided His Majesty's Government to notify Ihn Baud of their intention to suspend air action which s® has so dangerously excited Hejd trihes. Concession would appear to he almost as great as that which would he involved in an undertaking razing' fort of Busaiyah after restoration of tranquility and punishment of guilty.

Air Council are anxious to authorize Royal Air Force in Trans-Jordan to carry out reconnaissance flights for from 70 to 100 miles into Najd territory. They represent that unless this authority is given raiders who can move from 50 to 70 miles in a night can assemble on other ^ frontier and be well into Trans-Jordan by daylight before they can be founds I appreciate force of considerations raiseot by Air Council but there is objection to infringement by Royal Air Force of Kajd Trans-Jordan frontier as recognised^ by Hodda agreement unless clearly justified by recent violations of frontier by Najd tribes. So far as my infor mation goes no such violations have taken place. Putting ourselves in the wrong, if we were first to take initiative in crossing.

Can we iaake it app- -ear not as a weakness or if as a weakness as one done out of our strength and as a concession to our friend Ihn Saud ? The question is largely one for Iraq, to consider with an open mind. The object of the Busalyah fort and the other forts projected is to maintain peace on the frontier. If Ihn Saud will give his word that he will he responsible for all raids, will punish all offenders and will pay com- -pensation for all injuries we in return could agree that no forts should he huilt.

Please see in this connection correspondence ending with Sturgess' secret despatch of 30th September regarding overtures 'by I'bn Saud to Dhafir Ajaimi Chiefs. Local Bedouin tribes all agree that Xjaxx and other Dhafir chiefs have 'been continually receiving pre- -sents of money from I'bn Saud and there is no doubt that the defection of the tribe is chiefly due to this fact and that Ibn Saud has in respect of the Dhafir committed a definite breach of Article IV of the Bahra Agreement, not by 'offering presents to refugees' but by encouraging the whole tribe to migrate to Nejd . ■/x.

Xour telegram No. 124 and Baghdad telegram No. 144. With imminence of raids and present general position it is doubtful whether Ihn Saud can do anything to alter matters for the moment hut it stands out that he is still the ruler of Kejd and local Arahs refuse to ■believe that the Akhwan can stand without him. King Faisal said to me at Baghdad that the difficulty of Ilin Saud's position lay in his attempting at the same time to rule a people 'by means of fanaticism and I i to Maintain ito relations with civilised peoples on his frontiers. This difficulty has at the moment forced Ms hand, Tlie necessity of an emissary to Mm is greater than it ever was* it ia dear that Ihn Saud has no desire for this raid as such and that he wishes to maintain relations with the British Government. in support of this it is confirmed from several sources that he had definitely collected men to punish Faisal 'bin Dawish and I also have information that when the Shaikhs of Shargah and of Has al Khaimah sent and went respectively to him with complaints he replied that these matters con- ~cerned the British Government. It appears to me still as always that the hasis of all argument, with Ihn Saud and of all our action onon our part as long as Ms treaties exist is that tte Hule^ of Nejd must prevent raids and 'be responsi'ble for all lossei incurred if raids occur. The result of present anti- -cipated raid will show if the argument is tenable. think i J w^ll oanotwithstanding his apparent ifcaMlitjj to prevent this raid. If however this is incorrect the treaties zst are in this respect useless and new ones must he made per- •mitting defensive forts on frontiers. By the time that Clayton reaches Ihn Saud the. present crisis will te over and thus no concessions to meet present'troubles hut a permanent adjustment will he required. As regards Article III of the Ifeir treaty I do not thin* any mileage can he stated tut the nearest wells to frontier would he those indicated. saud refers to wells used hy his people; these would have to he determined and defined and e a ually those used and required hy Iraq..

A proposal is also under consideration for the formation by the Ministry of Defence of two companies of Ford cars armed with machine guns ( forty to fifty cars in all ) for the defence of Amarat. A scheme is being prepared by the Ministry of Defence for the formation of a mixed camel corps of about 500 men, consisting of tribesmen and Ira 4 regular troops, to be under the control of the Air Officer Command -ing. ihe Ministry of the Interior have purchased eight Chevrolet cars to be used in conjunction with the DIWANIYAH camel police for scouting purposes.

(a) He has no intention himself of declaring jehad. (h) He alleges that MUTAIE at all events are out of his control. ^c) Still all ages indiscrImxnsitirO tomlDing of inno^siitf aS reason ror h±s inalDllity to punish (uj He^ hints, that further raids on Mesopotamia, will take place as 11 impatient ones are 'prooeedine somewhere. '* (a) He further hints that such raids will continue unless his four demands are acceded to. (f) He_appears to imply that he is not going to Hejaa otherwise he would hardly have offered to meet the Eesident. 1 ll I ffith regard to (c) it is important to emphasise and keep on emphasising that there has 'been no 'bomhing of human heings other than those pursued hotfoot after ifaids of January 27th in Kuwait territory and of February 19th at Jarishan in Iraq.. Between lath Jan- -uary and 2nd February a tew homhs were dropped in the neighbourhood of encampments in operations zone within Nejd territory in order to frighten them into obey warn- -ings already scattered in accordance Vt'ith programme set forth in my telegram of 4th January, Mo. 9. Fo human beings were hit but only four or five camels killed. This is the sole foundation for the reiterated allegations under (c). W ith^ Wlt.li regard to (e) and. the four cLamands (1) It has 'been settled as announced in your tele- -gram No. 133 of 15th March that the demand cannot he acceded to. C^) It has already 'been agreed hy Article 10 of the Bahi-a Agreement to make special arrangements for extradition of criminals.hut Ihn Sand's real demand has always heen for surrender of refugee trihes and he has heen repeatedly told that the Iraq. Government cannot accept this vide pages 7 and 72.-74 of Clay ton's Seport, Kiddle East Ho. 7. (3) Demand for prevention of officials mixing with trihes is imintelllgihle unless it either amounts to demand that Iraq, officials shall not travel in desert aone to keep in touch with their own trihea or to reiteration of allegation'that DAHMSHAE of AEASAT af( properly a Kejd trihe and that Iraq, officials should not correspond with them even when in Ira% territory.

Ihn Saud*s letters are special pleading and do not represent finality. ^ 1 have alwa'ys heen of the opinion that he approved of a demonstration against Busaiyah to strengthen his political case of difficulty of restraining trihes hut that destruction of fort and killing of garrison put him in wrong position. His continued ohjection to fort and the provocation it gave his trihes is his hest defence against his responsihility for attack on it, which is otherwise indefensible. (3) His desire to prevent shelter of political criminals is understandable if impossible and point can only he met hy conversation. (3) He prohahly refers to Faisal's intrigues, which we know have taken place. If we can satisfy him that these do not have the countenance of British officials in Iraq, without actually admitting that they have taken place we shall prohahly satisfy him. Both sides intrig- -ue. Oriental diplomacy without intrigue is a contra- -diction in terms. / (4) He knows perfectly well that homhing could not have taken place without the sanction of His Majesty's Government. His object is fairly obviously to have a bolt hole. It we do not punish the people who crossed his frontier how can he punish his people for doing the same'^fe same thing ? Ee naturally slurs the point that hik^ trihes crossed the frontier and attacked Ira^. Face to Tace this point would he pushed home every time he attemptec to evade it. Ihn Saud is however Dictator of Nejd. If some tiihes have got out of hand it is only temporarily. The Ikhwan are practically his regular army. ' They depend on him lor their money, food, clothes and even the clothing of their women. without him they have no ammunition and must raid in Nejd for a living. Unless they get tired of him and murder him he is the dominant factor in the country. Thus as long as he is there no one Mse can maintain order and with him only can we deal. We must recognise him. Thus it is worth meeting him and deciding questions hut in doing so we must also recognise his diff- -iculties without allowing him to 'bluff us with them. Hence my endorsing Cairo's suggestion vide my telegram 8-T of 1.0th/ March that if he would accept full v ' responsihility we should if Iraq could agree dispense with the new forts. Otherwise forts are ohviously necessary. But conversation with him will clear this point. In the meantime Bin Saud may write accepting the invitation to Jeddah hut his letter and present circum- -stances do not suggest that he coulfi. do this in the immed- -iate future nor would conversation there do much good if he did not know what was happening here. I now think that with all the evidence at hand a meeting on this aide would he better. If you have not decided to send Clayton I would suggest that I should hold meeting this side with Bourdillon present with watching 'brief to represent Iraq.. I would try and get Ihn Saud to Ujair, would have wireless set on launch and would he in immediate touch with you and HIGH Oommissioner. RESIDENT.ifTelegram p. FroEl Political Agent, Kuwait.

Telegram P., from His Majesty's Consul, Jeddah, to Foreign O e FICE , N o. 1, dated the IO t H january 1928. In a letter dated the 23rd ultimo addressed to me from Riyadh, Ibn Saud states that Nejd-Iraq affairs have reached a very critical point.' He states that there has also been trouble in the Persian Gulf between British officials and certain of his subjects. He is doing what he can to avoid any incident which might impair his relations with Great Britain and is daily correspond ing with High Commissioner of Iraq, but without result. He therefore appeals to His Majesty's Government to help him to find a solution to his difficulties. The letter is couched in very vague terms but from Doctor Damluji I gather that Ibn Saud feels that the only means of arriving at a settlement is for a delegate to be appointed by His Majesty's Government to examine point at issue and for latter to attend a conference of representatives of Koweit, Iraq and Nejd. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was told by me that I would telegraph the King's views but I felt that it would better meet the case to have a private conference between the King and a representative of the Hio-h Commissioner.tee 130 (135) {Eeceived on 4th February 1928, with Folitical Secretary's letter No. 5, dated the 19th January 1928.)

I approve your language in your telegram No. 1 of January 10th (Serial No. 134), Nejd-Iraq relations. You should reply in the following sense to Ibn Saud. His Majesty's Government greatly appreciate His Majesty's confidence in them and are most anxious to assist in every way in their power to find a solution of the present difficulties between Nejd and Iraq. For this purpose they hope that His Majesty may find it possible at an early date to accept the invitation which they sent him on 2nd January to meet Colonel Haworth, the Eesident m the Persian Gulf, for a discussion of the regrettable misunder standing which has arisen in regard to the treaty. They are unable to under stand on what grounds His Majesty and the^ Nejd tribes could regard the construction of the Busaiyah fort as an infraction of the XJquair Protocol: the latter speaks of ' Ala Airaf A1 Hadud ' (near the frontier) whereas Busaiyah is no less than 50 miles from the neutral zone. It is of the first importance that this misunderstanding should be cleared up. His Majesty s Government are confident that the object will be fully attained at a meeting between His Majesty and Colonel Haworth but should any further discussion appear neces- sarv at a later stage they will be quite prepared to consider other arrange ments for a meeting between representatives of themselves and His Majesty. Meanwhile they hope that His Majesty will realise their own difficulties. They have a very definite responsibility in respect of Iraq and for tms purpose the High Commissioner at Baghdad is their representative. This responsibility applies more practically to this maintenance of order and defence.^ Innocen Iraqis have been murdered and robbed by Nejd tribes. Just as His Majesty must accept responsibility for the action oi the Nejdis, so His Majesty s Government must observe their responsibilities for the defence Qf the Iraqis. It is in these circumstances that they have, as His Majesty has already been notified, been compelled to authorise their Air Force m Ira q to pumsh the raiders and, if necessary, to purse them across the border, ^is Majesty ^ill realise that these punitive measures are justified and inevitable, but that they are in the nature of policy measures against criminals and are in no way military measures against) Nejd. His Maiesty's Government do not understand reference to trouble between British officials and Nejd subjects in Persian Gulf, but this would be a matter which could readily be cleared up in discussion with Colonel Haworth. aNo, b f gGPS ...6«...969...5000...30 -n-3fB.

It deal® with rumours which in ray belief are being circulated by Yusuf Bey al 1 ansur as to the favours shown to him by Your Highness of his visit to Kiyadh and the orders which he pretends to hare received from you with regard to the u building of a fort and mosque.Abul Ghar within 'iraq territories and the collection of Sifcat for that purpose from 'Iraq tribes. As you will see he also asserts that Your Highness has sent with him an »alim whose duty it will be to lead the prayers at the new mosque, together *ith an agent, a Hafai, through whom he says he is instructed by you to call upon Huiaud ibn Suwait for the surrender of 100 camels taken by the Dhafir from the tribes of Hajd. Yusuf Bey has even gone the length of stating that under your orders he is to exact khaweh from Fahad Bey ibn Hadhdhal. Relying upon the integrity of your intentions and on your firm desire to preserve the terns of the treaty recently signed by Xour Highness. His uajesty King Faisal and myself on behalf of the British Government. 1 am convinced that Yusuf Bey's assertions are not in \ accordance with any inetructions which he has received from you. but I desire to call your attention to the factthat faroura sliown by your goodsslf to ' Iraqi subjects are liable to gross misinterpretation which may lead to misapprehensions so serious as to endanger the relations between the two irab States and it would be to me a source of great satisfication if my friend would authorise me to give a oategorioal denial to the false hoods which have bean put about by Yusuf al xnsur. If any of your subjects or 'aliras have accompanied him, I would ask you at the sane time to issue immediate orders for their return so that all possible causes of friction may be aroided. ith regard to any camels claimed by your subjects from the hafir. Your ighness is well aware that this is a matter for amicable representations to the 'Iraq (orernnent who in their side have claims of the same nature. earnestly to warn Your , ighness against entering into personal relations with shaikhs who are subjects of the 'Iraq. Your benevolence is ever liable to be misinterpreted by theai as an intention on your part to interfere in the internal affairs of the 'Iraq. I would suggest that on the occasion of such visits a» those which have been paid by Yusuf fley and Hamud ibn Suwait Xour highness would find it convenient to inform the •Iraq Government in a friendly manner of the general tenour of the converoations which you have held witi] them so ae to avert the danger of malicious exaggeration on give you friendly notice of visits from your eubjects and of their object in earning to the 'Iraq.

Xo honour our guest, particularly a man like this, is a matter which under no circumstances whatever can le neglect or trifle with. He left our territories Just as he entered them with the same cordiality. Both in fact and in our opinion his tour was a simple matter.

But it is to he regretted that they originate from a highly placed official of the 'Iraq Government, who, I believe, was very iiapetuous in submitting that report without due reflection. As we respect the bands of that Treaty to which we have affixed our signature, we cannot afford to appoint x'usuf &gt;eg al . ansur to levy taxes in our name, or to entrust to him the diaohartre of any duty, or place under his orders a unit of our forose, or diepatch in hie company men for the purpose of creating troubles and agitations. I give no attention to any of these false rumours and I give an explicit denial to all that was mentioned in that report.

When government has been alert, the only raids that have ever succeeded have been due to the fact that 1 Iraq tribes wandered off to the frontier, without realizing their danger i2 - danger and unknown to fovernment, Thio applied to the Duwish 1 s raid at Unsab in April 1924, and to tooth the Ghalidh and Jokhah raids thi year. The raids in X ; eceraber 1924 do not affect the question, as government had then taken no defensive me ureo. i^o tribe which had been marshalled by iovernment and obeyed orders has ever yet been raided ^ This may be partly a coincidence, but the value of marBhallin^ is till self evident. It must be accepted as an axiom that Shepherds are fools, or perhaps rather that they are liable to mob phsychology. One day, = or no apparent reason, they will suddenly panic and flee to the river. The next, tempted by better grazini or water, they will wander out without telling government, into the very jaws of the raiders, it is absolutely essential that government maintain almost daily touoh with the tribes. If the number of forts be sufficient, they alone, assisted by horse or camel messengers, may be able to undertake the f/ork. If not, cars are required to supplement the marshalling arrangements. If these cars be provided with i/\, the operation is much easier, For example, as long as there is no fort at bhabicha, if a f/f car detachment were posted on the Parb Zubaidah at say iUrkat Hamad, it could receive daily instructions from Abu Ghar, and could transmit locations in return. Failing i/2 ford toilers could be used, this would, however, obviously not be ao satisfactory, as the cars would have to ply backwards and forwards to the fort to receive and deliver instructions, Nevertheless it would be far better than nothing. Th© cars would not be exposed to any danger. The use or air patrols for mar shallini is uneconomical. should he primarily retainers a striking A b stated above, aeroplanesstrakinc force.

Yet for the past seven years, the mere worfl: Akhwan is eufficient to provoke a panic. 1*0 thought of resietance is entertained. In the old days, however, these tribes were by no means backward in fi^htin^, and played prominent roles in many pitched battles with ibn Kashid, Anai&amp;ah or even nutair and ibn ^a'ud. Xhair present demoralization may be attributed to two cau3es ; ~ (a) The Akhwan cuatom of slaughtering all males. (b) The fact that they h ve no organization and no leader. Many is the time in the past that Mutair have been defeated by the 1 Iraq tribes. It is even related that, on one occasion Faisal al Buwish himself was reduced to making 'dakhala** to halaaah Al Awwad o ' the /.ayyad. A L^AD .FPU T I!:; tbib:^ U . In former days, however, sue resistance was invariably organized by a great bedouin chief, ibn uwait, ^a'dun Paslia or ibn Hadhdhal. On receipt of a raid warning, this chief tan moved out hiu war banners and called, upon uhc shc-V'herds. the latter, sending back their families and sheep, collected round him their fighting men, which might total one or two thousand horsemen. ho attempt has ever been made by government to employ this method. the times of the great bedouin chiefs are passed Government has in fact acted to lower moiale. its only inter course with the tribes has normally been to w&amp;rn/ them to retireretire and retire. -iie shepherds, unorganized and implead, scatter about the desert in snail camps to fcraze, The raiders, 500 to 2 ,000 strong, Sail unexpectedly on little groups o twenty or thirty tents, si stance is hopeless. Moreover having tlieir tents and children with them, the first inclination or the men is to endeavour to save their property, or at least their lives and those of their inf?mts, all of whom are otherwise slaughtered. It is reported that Kisabah A1 Earbi, Shaikh of the Ghalidh, was killed with his two infant son? in his arms. A man cannot ficht with an armful or babies. demoralized remains to be seen, 1 am not hopeless that, if they were £iven warning and sent their families behind the defeneive line, and above all if they were su-.imoned by a real leader whom they knew and trusted and if he, with a backing of government forces, led the way, they mi, ht fight. *ven if they did not face a pitched battie, a bairaq of five hundred horse men in the offing would form a valuable asset, 'i'he Buwish, on his recent raids, is reported to have been only four hundred strong, 350 of whom were camelmcn, who are at a great disadvantage ith horsemen in a melee. (c) TIH^ C OUiA T BIK - AT Y ACK OR MOBILE GTRHClNG FQBCI . TACTIC \L WAOOMMklBSmCU . It ha© already been stated that the use of aeroplanes on a large scale to M search the desert,' during alarm periods is uneconomical, and that the proper role of aircraft is primarily with the striking force, It is quite possible, however, that, even after ground information has reported the presence ol raiders, further reconnaissance may be required, this stage, evexy hour may be of iiaportance, and this is the moment when aeroplanes should be freely called upon. whether or not the Shepherds are now hopelessly I distinguish this form of reconnaissance from the searchingJy searching the desert type, by calling it tactical reconriaiseiSace, These reconnaissancef thoui h they may include a certain amount of eleventh hour tribe marshalling are primarily intended to enable the strikine: force to locate its target and strike. Aircraft, having been spared hitherto, should now be fresh and musat be uoed freely. It should never be aseumed that, the warning received beln^ some days old, the raiders will by now have gone home. Haiders, who know that information of their departure from theii homes has preceded them, often lie up until the alarm has subsided, and then suddenly attack, Moreover it is a long way from JUajd to the 1 Iraq tribes. The raiders, before delivering their att ok, often travel far and fast. I'he day of battle is very exhausting particularly to the riding camels, who are galloped nearly all cay lone. *he day after the raid is moreover conveniently devoted to the organization and division of the loot. Thus, unless very apprehensive of punitive action, raiders nearly always camp for a day or two on the battle field. As an example, Muhsin al Firm raided the ^ayyad at bulman in December 1924, There were no government defensive measures, and no information was received until fugitive women reached 3 a maw ah on foot four days later, it waa immediately assumed that the raiders were by then far across the frontier, but a flight of unarmed aeroplanes was sent out to collect detail© by landing on fugitives, the aeroplanes found the whole raiding party still camped at Bulman. The total armament of the three machines was one automatic pistol. Once raiders have been definitely reported, tactical reconnaissance should never be relaxed until they have been located, or until it is definitely eetablished that the raiders have gone home. Aircraft should employ ground tracking where poeaihle. Thh paeaage of several thoueand sheep, for example, leaves a tract diecernitole f Wl the air. It was by followini; tracks that Muhsin al Firm wan overtaken the day after he leftleft iulman. When at a loss, machines do well to land on wells and water poolo # It is liunediately evident on the ground il water has been recently drawn from the wells, if there is new dung about, and if there are sheep or caiael tracks. In the same way, by landing on the .c ,u 1 b ttle field^ Lt m y be ascertain# -ed whether the raiders have gone home or not. Bedouins usually travel either dead straight home, or from well to well. By following their tracks for half a mile on foot and taking a compass bearing on them, aircraft know in what direction to pursue. It has been assumed above that aircraft will constitute the striking force. This i . by no means an axiom. The sar^ principles however apply. If the striking force be cars, horsemen or camel men, they also will have to carry out their tactical reconnaissance. Compared with aix*craft, they axe at a disadvantage, because the main body must De co. fitted and follow their tactical reconnaissance, if they are subsequently to interfere in time. In the case of aircraft, the main body may be kept at Bhaibah or Abu Ghar until the raiders are definitely located. THK C0UKT1-1B&gt;ATTACK , Aircraft are not an ideal striking force, because:- (1) Owinc; to the scattered nature of the target, they cannot inflict heavy casualties. (2) They cannot rescue the loot. Ae long ae the raiders secure enormous booty, they are tempted/ to raid again, even though they hare suffered caaualties. The ideal role of aircraft in the striking loiee is as a barrage, to demoralize, delay, and scatter the raiders, while the ground forces close with them. The only real defeat ever administered- 7 administered on raiders was that at Zisa, when Armoured Ca: overtook them* Armoured Gars are probably the best ground striking force at present available. fhila the 4ir tactical reconnalss ance is proceeding, the^ should probably move out to a favourable position, such as Adan or Tukhadid, erect their t/T mast and wait for orders. Armoured Cars should never despair of overtaking raiders, especially if the latter have looted sheep, which travel very slowly, Tankettes have been suggested as an alternative to Armoured Cars, these would probably be better still, being provided with both wheels and tracks, ANIMAL :.TOlJai?ra) aTUIKX^G FORCE. A Striking force mounted on animals is by no means out of the question, o form a camel force capable of seriously engagini, the Akhwan appears to be difficult, but a small camel force (30 or 40 len), (provided with Lewis guns if possible) could:- (1) act as a stiffening to tribal horsemen, (2) hang on the skirts of raiders, and round up loot abandoned 'by them when attacked by aircraft. A horse mounted striking force woulci be more valuable. The success or failure of cavalry in bedouin warfare depends on whether they can Just overtake the raider &amp; or not. Also on whether it so happens that there are water pools available or not. If raiders pass within fifteen mileo or so of cavalry, the latter should oe able to act.. If the-, can once close with raiders, horsemen (especially ix armed also with Ho tchkiss or Lewis guns) should be at a great advantage over came line n, owing to their superior mobility. W«re they al.so accompanied by a section of horse artillery, the effect should be devastating. Horses, however, though far more mobile within a radius of say twenty miles, lose their mobility at a greaterdietance. The horses jive out ana the force is cos^elle to retire. wn the whole, if cavalry and horse guns were to oocupy the poets i asaisted posaibly by tribal horsemen, they would stand probably about a 50, ohioice of overtaking raiders who came as far north as the defensive line in the gaps between the forte. Cavalry should be accompanied by a ibrd car for reconnaissance purposes, GHAZm: GKQUMJS , The aboye are the tmAn outlines of the system of defence. A few points remain for discussion. If the 1 Iraq tribe© are forced to remain concentrated near the sandbelt throughout the grazing season, they suffer enormoue looses in sh ep. The injury inflicted by the Akhwan during the past few years in sheep looted, ia probably not so great a© that suffered through the tribes being concentrated in areas where grajsin* was insufficient. On this subject, it is impossibl to lay down definite rules. Should rainfall be very heavy in the area north of the defended line, the tribes may not suffer at all. tiainfall in the Jazirah and in the adian area *1 o affects the issue. If the foimer br good, many tribes spend the grazing season in the Jazirah. If bad, they all cross to the Ghamiyah.

Political Agent,BahreinHot© on Bin Sauci ami his doings by Major C-C•J•Barrett Political Agent, Bahrein« i diaousaed the situation in Nejd with Shaikh Abdul la bin jaa last Monday and reported the result under my telegram Ho # a-87. The next day Shaikh Mohanod bin jsa came to see me to talk about Arab tribes. Eo knew much leas about then than i had been led to suppose. The following observations are derived from these two Shaikhs and others. It is Bin Saud's settled policy to hold Arabia by means of Akhwan wholly dependent on himseli . Bor t,his reason as tribes and individuals beoarae infected with the peculiar religious microbe which spread through Arabia some years back, he sent them his own teachers. These men in structed the tribesman whose capital hitherto had been invested en weapons, herds of camels and flocks of sheep t^ sell their possessions and settle down in villages. Here their sole occupation was to perform the stipulated prayers at the proper times. As they had no other work of any sort many of the Akhwan practically lived m the mosques. For their livelihood they had to trust to the genersity of Bm . saud who hoped in this way to keep them wholly dependent on himself, and have an army at his beck and cax-i cimed rationed by himself* The policy was very successful with the rank and file of the Akhwan who sold all that they had, but certain tribal chiefs did not see the wisdom of bfiggarmg themselves and being IS 1 to .'Wt to the o^icof the ruler Of Hajd. The*kept their property though they occasionally ~ „ ncJ sent their flocks and herds dissembled in so iar as tney sor.r. ^ i wellwell out into the desert, where they could not be seen daily by the A&amp;hwan, , The policy of Bin Saud is the reason for has so 0^ texi oa en descrioed as his outstanding generosity» Dro Dame in the ' Mason Memorial Hospital' report for 1924 has recorded. H from all parts of Najd come and visit their ruler. Each petty Shaikh or Headman of a division of a tribe taices with him several of his 1 subjects * when he calls at the capital. Each caller has his name registered by a secretary, who keeps a daily register with names ol visitors, and each ciay the name is read by the 'MudhaifaS or caretaker of guests, to the Sultan. One day the f Mudhaifa , showed me a list of a day and a half with a total of 797 visitors, and every one of these is fed from the royal kitchen, and very one upon leaving receives a change of raiment, some pieces of silver and supplies for the journoy M . The above description is that of a fine patriarchal aiat© of society, but Bin Saud has to be generous otherwise his starving subjects would soon deprive him of both kingdom and life, as the Akhwans, who have lost their flocks cannot live on prayer alone. in addition to reducing his tribesmen to a state which in Europe would be styled ' pauperism* Bin Saud appears to have monopolised the trade of the country in a maimer which must make the Bolshevists envious. It is well known that contrary to the wishes of the powerful Mutair tribe whose port of entry the town is, he has practically killed the trade of Kuwait, in order to further his own policy. He has enforced this policy, hitherto 'fahout by means of the armed riders of Bin Jilawi in such a thorough mariner that sinugsUng is practically unkown. I recently hail a letter from Bin Sauct througn his local agent•7,- h ■ agent asking for my assistano© ixi obtaining speedy clearance through the Bahrain Customs of 10,000 bags of rice for him self,, He keeps ajevery close eye on the sale of kerosin© oil by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and some time back object ed to the activities of Haji Williamson# He controls trade in fact as well as in name in a manner most unusual in such a large area as that under his rule® He grants concessions to his favourites for so long as they enjoy his favour. Qasaibi's many services to Bin Saud are rewarded not by cash but by trade concessions, which give him a sucker f s grip on the whole of the trade of Ujair, Qatif and Jubai 1 0 His influence with Bin Saud and the consequent pressure he can bring to bear on Najdis, enable him to purchase even pearls at a price below that of his competitors. in the political sphere it keeps all Najdis in Bahrein absolutely subservient to Qusaibi, as was shown in the Per- Hajdi sian/riots of 1925» At the present time the Najdi will not impart information. ' Do you wish to cut my neck'? he asks if questioned* When Bin Saud conquered the Kejaz he was advised to raise a standing army both to garrison the country and as a counter-poise to the Akhwan. it was explained to him that a policy which might suit the deserts would not suit the holy cities of islam. Moreover a reserve on whom he could himself fall back was necessary if for any reason the Akhwan should be antagonised. Bin Saud, it is said, would not accept this advice, which on first sight would seem to have been sound. To keep the obedience of the Akhwan Bin Saud must have unlimited supplies, if for any reason he should fall temporarily short of supplies, the Akhwan, who have not much sense and moreover a*teArabs whose brain is in thei r ■ — Viy- - -t (V^ t/iQir ayes, would say W w© have fallen into disfavour and Bin Sauci intends to destroy us. Yesterday he gave us nee buu today ae refuses us' # The main weakness of Bin Saud's policy however is the power of the big tribal chief* whioh ne undermined but has been unable to destroy, X'he leading Shaikhs of the Mutair, Ataiiah and A j in an have alv/ays been jealous of his power. Bin Saud is afraid oi a combination 01 tnese three tribes following their tribal neads but Shaikh Abdulla considers that he would in time be able to destroy them, all even if united, as disunion there is ±n all the tribes. Moreover he could bring the other 12 Akhwan tribes against them. Sultan bin Bijad known as Bin Eumaid, Shaikh of the Atai&amp;ah has a rival named Shaibani, who although not as powerful as Bin Hum aid could give him serious trouble, in the same way rivals could be set up against Bin Dawish and Bin Hathlain. Faisal bin Sultan al Dawish often called ibn Ashqah ( the grey camel) after his mother as there is doubt about his paternity, is the head Shaikh of the Mutair. fie is said to have been born just after Shaikh Rakhan of the Ajman was led away captive. Sultan al Dawish married Rakhan's wife without waiting for the death of her husband. He belongs to the Aiwa section of the Mutair, the other section being the Buraih ^ y of which ibn Busayis ibn Ashwan * * is the leader, Faisal ibn Dawish^sub section is named Al Doshanu Other sub sections are Al Jiblan under ibn LamiCSyO'l arid Al Fagliama cJU 1 under Jufran ibn Fug^iam kJi Abdul la bin isa al KJialifa considers that Bin Saud must be secretly instigating the Akfewan in their raids on Iraq. He points out that the Akhwan are depend ent on him for their arms, ammunition and even food itself. Ee has only to cut off supplies and the Akhwan are helpless. Wi thoutWithout ammition they caraiot even raid. The head Shaikhs Wr*' have certain reserves but these are limited quantity, A While agreeing with shaikh Abdulla that the first raid was probably made with the connivance -- of Bin Saudj i think it should be remembered that lawlessness grows with what it feeds on. Successful raids supply both the incentive and the means of carrying out others. For this reason it is quite probable that the subsequent raids were made against the wishes of Bin Baud, although his informa^ns kept him informed of tribal intentions, i not® that in each case Bin Saud has sent a warning to tne t British Government of the w uncontrolable excitement ol t/ie tribes 1 * . I have not yet been abl© to get any confirmation of the Kuwait report that the Akhwan have been coercing Bin Saud to join them in declaring a Jihad against all non Akhwans♦ Shaikh Abdulla who sent a special Bedouin messenger to Hasa on Monday 27th February to verify the report, very rightly pointed out that a matter of each major importance would certainly become known in Bahrein, Since Monday Bahrein has been visited by a northerly ■ ' J unabated rale, which is still ( Saturday) blowing with **»*»*«* the vigour, so that ordinary communication with/mainland by jolly-boat is cut off and consequently no news has coiae through. j am indebted to Khan Sahib Mirza AH and Mr. Abdul Razzaq for the following 'news' much of which is old. ' Bin Shqair, Bin Hunald and Bin Dawish have combined 'and intend attacking Iraq and Kuwait. Bin Sauci called on ' them to meet him at Eiadh but they refused to go and asked 4 him to meet them at Artawiyah, ' Bin Saud has no control over them at all. Bin Sa- 6 - V Bin Saud has wired to Abdul Aziz Qusaibi t.o go to 1 M©cca to advise his son Faisal who is Governor of Mecca, This last piece of information has been confirmed by Qusaibi himself who told me his brother Abclulla is coming to Bahrein in hi a place. ' Q.usaibi has stated that things have become very difficult for Bin Saud, H.3. in conversation with me Qusaibi said he could not understemd the action of the Mutair who were out of ha'/id but there was no chance of their bringing any i^ressur^e to bear on Bin Saud» Sharif Al Wai who took Taif for Bin Saud is said to have deserted his cause for that of the imam Yahiya of the Yemen, The people of Mecca have complained very bitterly to Faridoon Bay the Turkish representative about the oppression of Bin Saud. Fahad bin suwailaim, a relation of the Governor of Q,atif and a leading merchant of Bahrein, has received a letter from ibn Musaad Governor of Hail stating that Bin Saud has become much disturbed and called on the Headmen of ^asim, Shaqrah and Riadh to advise him as to the means of dealing with the Akhwan trouble. Some advised him to fight the Akhwan while others counselled the reverse. Bin Saud had expressed great fear of Bin Hum aid joining Bin Dawish» The Setter states that the Akhwan are bent on Jihad against Iraq and Kuwait now and Qatar and Oman later. The Akhwan have protested against Bin Baud's rocogni ;.ian of Qatar and Oman which they consider to be infidel states only fit to be conquered* The reason for the breaking up of Fahad bin Jelawii force was the protest of his followers regarding fight ing against Bm Dawish. The 01 an a advised Bin Saud that it&gt;0' ; it is illegal to force A&amp;hwan to figlit each other♦ A man who arrived m Bahrein from Jubail on 27th February stated that the Ajman were contemplating a move north towards jraq and Kuwait. Dr, Dame has several N^jdia in his hospital but as they had left their homes m Qasim etc 30 to 40 days ago their information is of no value. Bmsaud's letters are not sent by one messenger. Ee sends them to Bin Jilawi at Hasa&gt; who arranges for their desptach to Btorem. The last messenger did not breathe a word about conditions on the mainland. Major Holmes, representative of the Eastern and General Syndicate has been in communication with Bin Saud with a view to entering Najd. jn reply to a letter written on 12th December, Bm Saud replied by a letter dated 22nd January saying he would arrange fox- Major Holmes i&gt;o go uo see nim at an early date, A few days back, apparently an the same day as i got Bin Saud♦ s last com- muni cation ***1 shortly afterwards Major Holmes got a not© saying that owing to internal trouble Bin Saud had much to do and could not make it convenient to meet him at presant but would let him know when and where to meet him after his business had been completed. Qusaibi mentioned casually to Major Holmes that he would probably be invited to go to Jeddah, but not until 3 or 4 months had passed # This information confirms my opinion that Bin Saud is not in a position to meet any Europeans at present, a meeting with Europeans except at Jeddah, where it would look like routine business, would rouse fc*r too much opposition among Bin Saud's suspicious followers.
