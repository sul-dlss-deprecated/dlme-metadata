Deer Logsdail I enclose a copy of a letter from Mazagon Dock, Limited, Bomlay, to Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., Bahrain, about an M.F.V. in which I am in- . terested for this Agency. It appears to me that you might be able to get an independent opi nion on its condition and I should be grateful if you could do so and let me have it. Yours sincerely, A. Logsdail, Esquire, Secretary, Persian Gulf Lighting Service, Jufair, s f &gt;a\(co:y to bl kept in our office file) Copy of letter No.MD/B/62 dated the 10th January 1949 from Mazagon Dock Limited, Bombay, to Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co.Ltd., Bahrain. 45 y M.F.V. (Hull ) We refer to your letter No.1^33 of 15th November 1948 passing on to us the contents of a letter received by you from the Political Agent, Bahrein, asking for various particulars with regard to the M.F.V. which he proposes purchasing. We regret to advise that the craft in question were badly damaged here during the recent severe cyclone and the Acting General Manager, Mazagon Dock Ltd., considers that the cost of the necessary repairs would be too high^ to make their purchase advisable. As a possible alternative, he suggests, f^r the consideration of the Political Agent, Bahrain, the M.F.V.'Vljay Laxmi'. This craft is now lying in our Yard and has been undergoing general repairs at the expense of the present owner, Mrs.Moose. This lady offers the craft for sale at Rs.30,000/- but is prepared to consider a counter offer. The 'Vijay Laxmi' has a 65 H.P., 6 cylinder Atlantic diesel engine, giving a speed of about 7 knots at an estimated fuel consumption of 3 gallons per hour. Two 50 gallon fuel tanks are fitted in the craft. This craft is complete in every respect and is in fair condition. She is free from worm and fitted with a wheelhouse, steering gear, compass etc. A mast is fitted and derrick gear exists but the ^errick itself is missing and will need to be reple ^ed. She is not fitted with lavatories or wash-places, but these could be installed. Her overfcll length is 51 , 6 ,f , beam 15', depth 7 r and weight 25 tons. We are of the opinion that she is perfectly capable of sailing from Bombay to Bahrein on her own keel during the fair season, but would advise that freight for the carriage of this launch on deck from Bombay to Bahrein would be Rs.5,000/- in full. As Mrs. Moose states that she has had several offers in Bombay for this launch, we shall be obliged if you will let us know as soon as possible by Air lail whether the Political Agent at your port is interested in the purchase of this craft.While thanking you for letter No.S/7141 dated 4-12-'48 from U/S H,Sasse^ Ship Sales Co., detailing specifications of the motor launch 'Klavalex 1 , which you very kindly Dassed on to me, I regret to say that I do not intend to take the matter up. ojc Yours sincerely, S.0.No.K.79-3/6.

Dear Sir Rupert, I have been working of and on since the Agency launcn 'Felix Jones' was lost to get a new launch for this Agency and have made many enquiries and written quite a number o^ letters in the hope of getting on to something which would be acceptable to the departments concerned in London and would enable myself and any other Political Agent, Bahrain, to tour the waters and coasts of the ;ulf, whose importance, as you will agree, has perhaps never been as great as it is now. I thought I asked you to help in pushing the case forward and that I wrote to you about it, but can find no/letter on my file - my main letter to the Residency is my semi-official letter No.R.462-3/6, dated the 11th December, 1948, to Dredge, department what was happening in the matter. As far as I could gather, it was the endeavobr of the Foreign Office to obtain a craft which would combine the functions of the 'Nearchus' and our ordinary 50' cruising motor dhow. I think the replacement of the 'Diana' was mentioned in the same breath. I am taking no further action in the matter. such 2 *l/hen I was in London I enquired in the relevant Yours sincerely n His Excellency H t Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. ^ 5 &gt; I 7-iWN* • I.i HI i^t-ntr ' UK VflP'xt'iN CHC&amp;&gt;E C. f r. ■^•rn MANXSINS fl*'.

Witj^ reference to your semi -official letter Ko. R/110(3/6) of the 6th March about the replacement for the 'Felix Jones', you did v*rite to me asking my help in pushing the case forward, and I at once wrote to the Foreign Office. I enclose herewith a copy of the reply received from Moss. The only action I have taken so far Is to tell him that I do not think that the Political Resident should be subjected to the dangers and dis comforts associated with a long tour in the Gulf in a craft of the type of the 'Felix Jones' and to suggest that adequate accommodation should be provided for him and his staff in one of His Majesty's ships. I promised Moss a detailed reply to his letter in due course and asked Dredge to deal with the matter which he has not been able to do up to date owing to his absence in the United Kingdom. 2. I should be grateful for your views regarding the further reply we shoulo ser.d tc Moss 1 letter. It would be also useiul, I think, if we could have on record the replies to the questionnaire enclosed with it ever; if y.e are successful in finding a suitable boat without the intervention of the Admiralty. Ca-^ n/—• C.J. Pelly, Esq., CBE., Political Agent, Bahrain.25^ Foreign Office, b.W.l 8th February, 1949. Dear Sir Rupert, n I am replying to your letter 67/29/48 of the SOth December, about the replacement of,the 'Felix Jones' since Fisher has now left this Department and I have taken his place. I am sending you a copy of questionnaire with which the Admiralty has supplied us, the answers to which will give them the information they need to help us to find a suitable boat for you. The nevv launch will eventually replace the 'Felix dones' and the 'Diana'. Vie are wondering whether it is out cf the question for us to supply a craft, which will not only meet the needs which these two craft fulfilled, but will also be big and sturdy enough for you to use on the journeys for which you now employ the 'Nearchus'^ ? I presume that the 'Diana' alone is meeting your every day necus at present, anu. that you have accepted the suggestion made in Fisher's letter to Dredge on the 19th November, that she should continue to be used as long as possible and then be disposed of without replacement when the new boat is available. If this is so, you can apprently manage without too much difficulty auring the eighteen months or so which I fear will elapse before we find a suitable replacement foi tne elix ones', overhaul it, and get it out to youa If we are wrong about this please let me know, and we will endeavour to find another way out. Thank you for the information about the two boats, referred to in Felly's memorandum. The both sound quite promising, particularly the younger one, but we cannot properly investigate their possibilities or approach the admiralty until we have the information which the answers to the quGStionnaire will provide, as soon as we get your reply we will go thead with all possible spped.

Is there any limitation on breadth due to the necessity to pass through locks or dock gates, etc.,? Is there any restriction in height above wat^rline, caused by low bridges under whcih the boat must pass? Maximum draught permissible under way at full speed? Some ideas should be given of the minimum depth of water over sand bars, shoals, etc,, which may have to be negotiated by the boat, Vi /hat speed is required? Speeds in excess of 1S-14 knots for a boat 46 ft, in length, result in exceptional requirements for lightness of structure, a planing form of hull and high power light weight engines, these are liable to result In increased maintenance. High speed results in considerable squat of the stern which increase draught. The number of miles the boat is required to run at full speed without refuelling, alternatively the fuel tank capacity required? Diesel or petrol? Is there a particular requirement for special silence? Is so, this and the reasons to be stated. Electric starting for the propulsion engine with associated battery charging arrangements, low voltage lighting for the boat and navigation lights are normally fitted in small motor boats. Requirements for W/T, Radar, electric cooking, electric hot plates, electric radiators, electric fans should be stated but these are not normally fitted in beats under 70 ft, in length. An indication should be given of all electrical fittings required, to enable an estimate to be made of the dynamo capacity, A rough sketch showing users idea of layout would be helpful. The sketch should show deck houses, cockpit, awnings, arrangements of furnishings. Requirements for wash basins, W,C,, cooking and sleeping should be stated. Is the boat required to operate in sheltered waters, semi-sheltered or in the open sea? Do the conditions of operation lead to special requirements? )a) for circulating water to the engines due to slit ladden waters, (b) For a tunnellea propeller or other device to prevent fouling of the propeller,.,,11. 12. 16.

Is it desired that the boat should be built of teak? Is copper sheathiiig required? For Admiralty Service it is usual in small craft intended for service in tropical or sub-tropical waters where ship worm is prevalent and active, to fit copper sheathing. What arrangements are required for anchoring and mooring? Is the boat to be fitted to tow other boats ar barges? Is a dinghy required with a derrick or davit for lifting? What type of steering and what position of steering wheel or tiller is considered suitable? Is Coxswain control, local control at engine or both required? Is there a limit to the completed weight imposed either by the necessity to hoist the boat out, for maintenance, with existing crane facilities, or by the necessity to ship the boat in vessels with a certain limited derrick capacity? Are slings and fittings in the boat for lifting required? What make and type of engines are normally used in the operational areas in question, e.g. engines which might be specially well understood by local boats' crews and repair yards and for which spares might be available?S. 0. No 3-146-3/6-IV. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 23rd March, 1949. Dear Sir Rupert, Thank you for your semi-official letter No. (24 /21/49), dated the 10th March, 1949. I have been acting on the assumption that it was accepted policy that a separate launch is required for the touring of the Political Agent, Bahrain. The facts that 'we' 'can apparently manage without too much difficulty' for 18 months without any launch for the Political Agent, Bahrain, and that when we do get it^it is sup posed to fulfil the functions of the 'Felix Jones' and of the 'Diana' hardly seem consistent with that policy. However I have filled in the Admiralty questionnaire on the assumption that what is required is a motor cruiser for the touring of the Political Agent. Yours sincerely.

I enclose th^ answer to the Admiralty questionnaire which elves the specifications of the proposed new boat v c replace the 'Felix Jones'. As 1 explained to you In I onion during my recent visit, It Is not feasible for one craft to be used to replace the 'Felix Jones' and the 'Diana'. If you will please refer to Fisher's letter (XAOSIO /MKSA (4/48)) of the 21st July last to me enclosing the Inspectors 1 report on launches In the Persian Gulf, ycu will see that they have clearly stated that 'It will not be practicable for the Political Resident to share a launch with the Poli tical Agent, Bahrain, because the former may need a launch at a time when the Agent Is away on an official tour by see' . 3. 1 therefore hope ycu will he able to find a suitable replacement for the 'Felix Jones' as early as possible. 4.

(*( 14 feb 1950) hra^ We are at last able to give you some material for consideration in connexion with the replacement of the M Pelix Jones', The Admiralty have gone to a great deal of trouble in searching through their own stocks of possibly suitable craft and also in checking on the holdings of their disposals agents, and on craft recently sold by those agents to individuals. The results were not good and with our approval they finally called for tenders covering any type of vessel likely to be suitable. Prom the total of 29 tenders received they have selected the 10 which they consider most suitable and these are detailed in the enclosures to this letter. The vessel marked 1, in red pencil, appears the most suitable particularly as the engines are stated to be positioned aft, and the vessel is copper sheathed. For second consideration those marked 2 give promise, whilst those marked 3 a re only 'possibles' with this last group the information supplied is too scanty to enaole even the experts to give any firm opinion.

Political Agency Bahrain, 29th April, 1960 De^r Andrew, Matthews of the Conference and Supply Department wrote to you personally a letter (No.XC0610/9IK1(1/60) of 9th January, 1960) which dealt with the question of re placing the lost Agency launch and which Dredge passed on to me for disposal in original. Since then, after enquiries, I have replied to the department selecting a launch and asking them to have it sent here as soon as possible. Its cost is £4,900 and it seems reasonable to suppose that any delay there may be will be due to delay in making payment. 2. I have made enquiries locally and find that the salvaged parts (engine and accessories) of the 'Felix Jones' will fetch about Rs.9,000/-. The slaving ^aunch 'Joker' ought to sell for about Rs.20,000/-. It has occurred to me that it might soften the blow to the Treasury and thereby expedite the delivery of the new launch if we could credit the price of the salvaged parts of the old one and of the 'Joker''to H.M.G. .Would you ask Sir Rupert Hay if he could apply for sanction to my selling locally at the best price available the salvaged parts of the 'Felix Jones' and also the 'Joker' launch? I should add that in any case it is time that both of these were disposed of. There is no point whatsoever in keep ing them and their prices are likely to drpp. I cannot lay hands on the hill for the cost of the engine of the 'Felix Jones', but I remember that when bought new at the end of the war from Kelvins its price was about Rs .17,000/-.

Dear Sir Rupert, I should te grateful if you would refer to the correspondence In the Residency on the subject of the supply of a launch for this Agency. When I was acting for you during the summer, I reminded the Conference and Supply Department, atout this and got a reply saying how it had taken about a yeer to choose a launch for this Agency and then to 'discover that it was unsuitable: facts of which I was already far too well aware. 2. It is of course possible to carry on the work of this Agency without a launch, but it Is most desirable that there should be one to enable the Political Agent to do his touring properly without being dependent upon Oil Companies and Shaikhs for transport. This has been accepted. The reason I am writing this letter is to ask you to be good enough to enquire whether it is to be im- plimented; and If so when. would save me having to write continuous reminders if I could have a reply one way or the other to this question.

I had hoped that by now I should have been able to send you news of definite progress in the matter, but I am afraid I am not able to do so. We are pressing the Admiralty continually, and I feel sure that they are doing their best to meet our request, but tne plain fact is that nothing suitable or good enough for refit and conversion can be found on the market. Although the cost would be much more, we have got them to agree to investigate the possibility of getting a vessel released from new naval constructions, I am afraid however that I cannot hold out very much hope in this direction. Disappointing though this information is, I have thought it better that you should know ^just how the matter stands; and I can assure you that we shall press it to the best of our ability.

De^r Sir Rupert, I was grateful to you for mentioning to me the launch 'Hooriya' which Gray Wacl'enzies have for sale, and I inspected it and had a trial run in it yes terday afternoon. It Is a beautiful little ship and I would very much like to be able to recommend that we should ask the Foreign Office to get it for the Agency. It is not however suitable for cruising in the open Gulf. The fact that it has no sleeping accommodation remedied and the large windows, through which water may pour in any sea even when they are closed, could probably be replaced by ports; lut even these alterations would be expensive and would rather spoil the ship as she now is. Apart from this, however, the free-board is so small and the hull so constructed in the modern way that she is bound to be very wet and uncomfortable in say a winter 'Shumal* - more wet and uncomfortable than a boat of her size need be. Croir bie of Gray Mackenzies who showed her to roe said he 'would go anywhere' in her; but Ueikle agreed with me that she is not suitable for work as a cruiser in the open Gulf. 2. I think the Navy ought to have her for shallow water work in view of what I hope is the likelihood that the Frontier Commission will make its first survey from the sea. The 'Hooriya' would make an ideal tender to to a larger ship carrying the members of the Comruission. and no galley for passengers could fairly easily be Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf.j : 1/ Dal/© of despatch DEPARTMENT OFFICE.

MFP—378 6767—50,000 Pad*. fAGENCY LAUNCH . I have been unable to find any plan such as one would expect for the launch now being built at the Agency pier. The head carpenter has produced a sketchy drawing, the authorship of which is obscure. The carpenter does not follow this in several respects; he could not be t*) 4*-* expected^in most, since all detail (which is what boat design really araount^) has been left to his own imagination assisted apparently by occasional ad hoc orders from my predecessor (not apparently correlated to any plan) to place doors and lockers in various places. When I made the comment to Hickinbotham , that no provision was made for a galleyj he rejoined that none was needed as one spent most of one's launch trips on the flat of one's back and in any case could always obtain some .rice from the crew. On reflection, I can hardly think that this remark was meant to be serious. I have travelled by launch to every wilayet (except Salalah) on the Muscat 1,000 mile coast-line, and to every state on the Trucial Coast, from Sharjah to Bahrain and back across the open Gulf (10 days each way)-from Kuwait to Basrah many times, from Bahrain to Qatar, have' been nearly wrecked once and been several times in heavy weather. And during all these Journeys I had my own food cooked. I see no reason why one should make diffi cult conditions more difficult than necessary. This same tendency is apparent in the building (I cannot say 'design') already comprleted on the launch hull. The 'bridge' or 'Wheel house' is of massive construction about 2 feet high and twice as deep (forward - aft) as it need be. Furthermore, the cabin roof is about 2 feet and engine room roof about a foot higher than is necessary. The centre of gravity of the boat is thus raised and wind resistance increased. Both will,of course, make for instability, /rolling....rolling and consequent discomfort. Everyone realises the need in a launch designed for gulf travel for good sitting space on deck. Yet the major * part of the boat's decK space is taken up by the coach roofs (to drain off the rain?) over the cabin and engine room leaving a small sitting space astern the only place / to sit in a 70 foot launch. it is furthermore the hottest place one could find^as aft of a Kelvin engine is always bound to be. in any case I think T am right in saying that coach roofs are only used in small launches. Having favoured the cabin with its high coach roofs at the expense of the whole boat, the balance of irrational- ity is restored by depriving it of any air ; thereby making it practically unusable. This could easily have been avoided by placing the bridge aft of the cabin and fitting it (the cabin) with forward facing windows looking on to the fore deck. • At the same time a galley, lavatory and clerk's cabin should have been placed aft of the main cabin thus insulating it from the noise and heat of the engine room. Other arrangements are of course possible. But the point is that it is quite possible to arrange for such accommoda tion in a boat of tnis size if properly designed. It has / been provided for in the 'GHAZAL' (the P.C.L. launch) v x which is a much smaller boat. And even with this accommo- dation it would be possible to have ample sitting space on the decked roof of the main cabin, etc. forward of the bridge where the air caused by the boat's motion is always available. x The cost (apart from the cost of the hull and engine) of this particular excursion into boat building has been already over Rs. 17,000/-. In the month of February the Kuwaiti carpenters were paid Rs. 1,848/-. The only way, as any one who has been stationed in Kuwait /ought ' 4. 5.ought to know, to avoid these carpenters doing the minimum amount of work was to show theia a detailed plan and to ask them to quote their prices for it. As it is for the last seven months they have been mulcting us^and doing as little work as .they' pleased. There seems to be every possibility that the story of the Muscat launch will be repeated and for the same reasons. I have given much thought to the matter but I am unable to - suggest any way in which the present structure could be modified so as to make a reasonable design. What I do feel is that we should get out of this as soon as possible even if it means cutting our losses. I woulc, therefore, suggest that we try to sell the launch as it is and retain the money until prices-fall. rhe carpenters would be dis missed forthwith. I only retained them until I could submit this matter for P .R. 's orders. I do not believe this launch can be a success 0Ai^NCY LAUNCH. J first point triat occurs to me is that) whether we approve of the design or not, without financial help we cannot afford to carry on with the work even if it were organised at this stage to conform to some plan and/or contract. Expenditure to date amounts to:- ' ^ a) Carpenters 1 wajes from 25th July 1944 to 30th April, 1946. . ' Rs. 13,458. b) Material. Rs# 4,000. c ' Hull » -s. 5,000. Total. Rs. 22,458. » HiBi. The cost of the engine has not been included because the Government of India sanctioned an additional appropriation or ^ s »l r ,iQ..ZlZ~ f^r launch grant to cover its cost. The P.A. is therefore faced with the choice of a) carrying on with the launch in which case he will have to ask for financial assistance from the P.R. b) abandoning it until more funds can bp accumulated or selling out. An immediate decision one way or-the other is essential because we cannot afford to keep on the Kuwaiti carpenters at Rs. 1650/- per month. Once they are dismissed we mi: r ht as well abandon all hope or completing the job as local tradesmen are useless. 2. If we carry on a) A proper plan should be prepared and some one asked to contract for the work. ' b) We cannot estimate the cost without a plan-but I think another Rs. 5000/ — would be a conservative - estimate under present conditions. 3. If we abaiidon work a) I see no prospects o^f accumulating the requisite . funds from our own resources.- 2 - I miderstand unofficially that His Highness mijht be interested in buying it (less engine) and that we mi^ht expect to get P.s. 20 - 25000/-. If the price is anywhere in the neighbourhood of Ps. 20000/- without the engine, I should say it is worth accepting and^if necessary^cutting our losses, 4, The olan if work is continued * In general,-I agree entirely with your criticism of the present design in the light^of my experience 4 of many launch journeys in Muscat. a-) I think as you say the launch will be top heav^ because the superstructure is much too high, b) The wheelhouse is out of all proportion to practical requirements. c) There is neither good cabin accommodation nor ample sitting out space - in fact, for the latter there are only two places forward of the * wheelhouse(when you block tu view of the nakhudalor aft of the engine room where you get no breeze. I can imagine nothing more uncomfortable than travel^ ing any distance on the launch as it is I v/ith nowhere to sit on deck and a cabin which ' will be insufferably hot most of the year. d) A cabin should be. insulated by a galley and V/.C. from the engine room. I agree that it is difficult to suggest any method by which the present structure could be designed to produce a satisfactory finished article. 5. Conclusion . I see no alternative but to sell out.and we should not be out of pocket to any great,extent, if at all. I would like to make one suggestion. Would it not be possible to put forward' some general scheme for the provision for all posts in the Gulf of a standard type of motor launch to be made availablewammmmmmm - - I ' h from the scores of small craft which will be for sale or disposal at the end of the war? If the suggestion were accepted in. principle (I imagine finance will put uo a stiff Jright) it mijht be possible to select a suitable type anri decide on a standard design. , f 26-4-45. • !

Dear Sir, o^ble Bahrain Receipt , With reference to your c^ble enquiry - we are sorry that this is so vague that we are unable to give you a fim quotation, but we have sent you under separate cover a copy of our pre-war Catalogue which may assist you. The prices certainly are now out of date; the increase would be approximately 40/50^ and many of the items we cannot supply, but it will probably be sufficient to enable you to send us a firm enquiry or give us your instructions. Meantime we can tell you that the price of the S.L. Pattern W.G. complete is £9.10/-; our KENTIGERK pattern £16.17.6d; Seacocks and other fittings are extra depending on what is required. We are sorry that we cannot make you an offer for Lighting Set; we understand that the Kelvin people supply this, if required, themselves. Glass for windows in 3/8' thick would cost approximately 3/- per sq.ft. but of course you will note that the thickness varies, and we have only taken the 3/8' as being the possible size. By ordinary mail we have sent copy of this letter together with specification for a 16ft. Dinghy. In the ordinary way we do not handle Boats, but we have got a quotation from Messrs.McGruer &amp; Go. of Glynder, who are Builders of an exceptionally high-class vessel. The price they quote is £90 P.O.B. From Yard. ;ie should charge you a commission for booking and there would be in addition to the above price a charge for the cost of crating and shipping, a certain number of fittings could be packed inside the Dinghy.

The only possible buyer on the Trucial Coast for the Agency launch is the Shaikh of Dubai. Shaikh Sai'd had already left for ITuscat but I spoke to Pashid about it. He said that he likes to buy it but cannot do so before knowing all details about it For this purpose he has decided to send two of his men to Bahrain by air to have a look at the launch and then come back and report to him. They vail probably be leaving for Bahrain within the next seven days. I shall give them a letter of introduct ion to you. If the launch is found suitable, I, think Rashid will be prepared to pay Rs.40,000/- for it.

Reference Agency endorsement No.R-119, dated the 16th June, 1948• 2. The Political Officer, Truclal Coast, trought the launch crew and the pilot, which they took with them, back from Dubai yesterday, and after examining them, I believe the following Is a correct reconstruction of the events which led to the loss of the launch: During a passage which I made In the launch In March, a few seams opened In hervy sea and we had diffi culty In getting to an anchorage. On my return here the under water portion of the hull was examined and re- caulked so that when the launch left here on the June 9th It was believed to be sound. The passage was without Incident until the evening of the 10th June when Sir Bu Na'alr Island was sighted about 9.00 p.m. At the same time leaking commenced to such an extent that the fuel pump had to be manned conti nuously. The pilot altered course, which then would have been from Sir Eu Na'alr to Sharjah, and turned southwards to the Abu Dhabi shore. He anchored off Ras Hasa In water shallow enough to put the launch aground at low tide. Then there was some caulking and repairing done, but at high tide the Shumal came up, the shore was a lee shore and the launch was. In the course of the following three days, pounded to pieces. A man had been sent to Dubai for help and salvage was carried out under the Political Officer, Truclal Coast's direction for three days. The engine which Is believed to be in working order and most of the moveable parts of any value were saved and have been brought to Bahrain. 3. I formed the opinion thrt the pilot obtained on this occasion by the coxwain of the launch for the Journey was Incompetent and should have been able to get the launch to Sharjah. I believe also that he was selected by the coxwain for considerations other thfm th: t of his ability. The coxwain 1 s record has not been particularly good and he is therefore being dismissed. 4. Proposals regarding the disposal of the salvaged parts will be forwarded in due course. (SOD) C.J. PELLY Political Agent, Bahrain. J f&amp;V tA/v for Assistant Political Agent, - r Bahrain.

The first necessity is to find out whether the present engine mount ing is sound.

If you are agreeable, I-wovld therefore 11' e you to see the launch 1 am thinking of converting and perhaps .you would then give an opinion as to whether the hull ic sound with the present engine mounting and whether my ideas for conversion, which 1 shall explrJn to you verbally, are feasible. Cou'd you come to the Agency on Monday at 5 o'clock and we could take a short round in the launch which I shall probably have at the Customs pier as there will hardly be enough water at my own?

Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, /c 1D.O.No. / political agency, bahrain, Dated 12th June, 1948. My dear Dredge, In your D.O.No.1617-34/9, dated the 8th June, 1948, you sent me a blue print (returned herev/ith) of the launch you are hoping to buy and asked for my opinion about it. 2, I think it would really only be satisfactory for either of the purposes you mention for short distances, in good wecther, and with not more than three or at the most four people aboerd. You will have noticed that the l .O.A. is about five feet less than that of the motor boat 'Diana', the well-deck from which to fish Is only fig four feet long, head-room Is only five feet^* The boat does not draw more thnn nbout a foot and a half, the design seems to me to be excellent for Europeen conditions sA, any rata, but no account naturally has been taken of the fact that even for a boat of this size one is practically bound to have a local crew. There is gtf^jLOui'gau no space for even one such man to sit (except with the passengers) much less is there any place for him to eat. It seems not clear from your letter that the boat is/for you personally. I have given my opinion envisaging it as an official boat required to carry perhaps five or six people, servants, a crew, and perhaps luggage, but of course that idea may be entirely wrong. Yours sincerely. Major a.l.a.

I hope you do not mind. It is a very suitable type of boat for Agency work (without the worm of course) and I wonder if you could let me know where it was obtained, whether any others are available, and the price. It is, i think, 61tr : long. Yours sincerely, B.H, Lermitte, Esquire, MBE, Manager, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., BAHRAIN.D.O.No. SOU / - 3//6 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 13th July, 1948 Dear Allen, You may remember that Captain Porter suggested that an Admiralty M.F.V. would be a suitable type of boat for the work required by this Agency. I have seen one of these^li 1 long and I entirely agree. It is owned by P.C.L. and at the moment anchored at Muharraq. The only snag is that the hull has been attacked by termite. 2. I wonder if Captain Porter knows whether a similar boat could be obtained for this Agency (without the worm of course) and the cost; and whether he would be prepared to help us to get one. The Kelvin diesel engine is a particularly attractive feature of the boat I sawas it is an engine with which locals are familiar. 3. It just occurred to me that if there are any more ur^C - of these boats available, they woutd probably be snapped up quickly.

The hull is extended some 18 inches above the deck to form a gunwall from Bow to Stern the lines are bluff and they have Cruiser Sterns. 7. The M.F.V's purchased by us were built in Capetown in 1944. They are very heavily framed in Sawn Timbers although some may be built of grown timbers, the planking is 1-|' to 2' thick making a total light displacement of 50 tons. The Hulls are unsheathed and great care has to be exercised in purchasing in Bombay owing to the prevailance of Teredo Worm. Various other M.F.V's were on offer in Bombay but none so attractive as the ones we purchased.

Dear Colonel Galloway, The position as regards launches in this Agency is that we have the 'Bandar Abbas' launch fitted with a \ new engine and for which Rs.11,600/- has been sanctioned for fitting out (vide Johnsons D.0.No. 1379 -34 /3, dated the 23rd May, 1948). Further more I have had the sal vage! engine of this Agency launch (which was wrecked) set up and it is in good condition. 2, The estimate for fitting out the 'Bandar Abbas' launch was made by Jackson and I did not have time when It was put up to go into the matter in any detail. I have now done so and am convinced that any satisfactory fitting out could not be done for the money sanctioned; and indeed that no fitting out - after our experience here and in Muscat with native built hulls - would ever make a satisfactory launch for our purposes. 3. What I propose then, with the amendment noted in tbc following paragraph is that we should sell locally the 'Bandar Abbas' hull with its fitted engine and also the engine of the old Agency launch. I estimate that for the two engines and the hull we should receive between 36 and 46 thousand rupees. This amount, together with the sanctioned amount for the fitting out of the 'Bandar Abbas' launch, which amount, for purposes of argument, we could assume as available to us, would give us between Rs.46,600/- and Rs.66,600/-, With this I propose we purchase either an M.F.V. or English cruiser hull properly fitted out for our purposes. WeKrould, of course, then have only one launch His Excellency Lt. Col. A .C. Galloway, CIE, QBE, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.BMi -2- i r- ^ launch, but., If (as ar M.F.V. certainly would bo) it was suitable for long distance trips, it would serve both Sharjah and Bahrain and Qatar; I mean that there would be no necessity for two launches - one for Sharjah and one for Bahrain. 4. I enclose an article from 'The Motor Boat and Yachting' about the M.F.V.s. • P.C.L, purchased three of them and I inspected one anchored at Mnharraq bridge and found that its type (the 611' type shown in the article) woi^ld be ab solutely first rate for our purposes. I wrote to Lermitte about it and enclose his reply in original. Incidentally some Teredo worm was found in the hulls purchased by P.C.L, i and that, of course, is a serious flaw, 6. As you will see from Lermitte's letter, there are unfortunately no further 61-J- 1 (L.O »A. 66*) models available, but copper covered 45*, price Hs,34 &gt; 000/-, might possibly suit us and I should be grateful if you would enquire from the Ministry of Transport whether it is still available and whether it is (particularly the engine) in good con dition. 6. The amendment I mentioned above is this. You will notice that P.C.L. thought it better (vide Lermitte 1 s letter) to get new engines fitted to the hulls purchased by them. We might therefore merely sell the 'Bandar Abbas' launch and its engine and keep the old Agency launch engine and fit it to a new hull, I am a bit doubtful about this scheme as it is difficult - though perhaps not nov; impossible - to get such work done satisfactorily here. In any case it will do no harm to enquire as to the condition of the five 46* hulls only mentioned at the end cf the enclosure to Lermitte 1 s letter. If one of those hulls were in really good condition, it would probably do us all right when fitted with one of our engines. Perhaps you would also enquire whether the hulls-3- hulls are complete in every respect except for the engine. 7. I have also enquired from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, whether he knows of any M.F.V.s available and he has asked for details 'by air mall from the Ad- 8.

I am , sorry to have to trouble you futther, but should be very grateful if you could enquire (a) whether two of the 46* M .F.V. hulls at Rs.3000/- each, mentioned at page 2 of your Fields Managers letter No .MDP /l87, dated th»? 22nd July, 1948, are in good condition. (b) whether they are free from worm. (c) whether they are complete in every respect except for the removal of the engine, i.e. have they got masts, wind-lasses, v/hee 1-houses, steering gear, propellers, rudders, and so on, are tbey fitted out below? I imagine the 46 footers are fitted as shown at page 174 of 'The Motor Boat and Yachting' enclosed herewith. Your 66 1 boats were certainly fitted \ exactly as shown at page 175. I should be glad of the article back when you have seen it. (d) whether these hulls could be fitted with Kelvin engines model 04 60 h.p. (I enquire this particularly because as you know these engines are some^hai; massive and one wants to be certain that they can be fitted into the hull. The drawing indicates that they could). While making the enquiry it probably would be no more trouble for you to get an opinion on the 46 1 copper-sheathed M.F.V. (particularly as to the state of its ermine) mentioned in your Fields Managers letter (e) whether hulls arc fitted v/ith lavatories and wash places. Yours sincerely, B.Ii.

The Foreign Office inspectors, when they were here, noted that the running cost of all * launches in the Gulf was very high and suggested that officers should find ways and means of reducing costs having only one permanent member of the crew, and by filling up with men normally used for other full time work, e.g. farrashes. 2.

I had thought of purchasing one for my own use as a Yacht, the towage to Qatar was, however, too high. I have further report on the 45' Atlantic from Messrs. Gill &amp; Fidele and Gill waxes enthusiastic on this craft. The owner, I believe, is leaving India and for that reason wishes to dispose of it, the cost to the present owner is said to be Rs.45,000/-. I trould recommend this boat as a great deal of work would have to be carried out on the others. Yours sincerely, Sgd. A .E .NELSONcopy CRAFT O FFWW IN BOM BAY, 4^ M.F.V. at Hs^OOO, It is considred that wo hulls basically sound could be picked out of the five offered. Of the Craft purchased by this Company one had to have about two thirds of a whole nlank and four pieces some 15 Inches in lenpth renewed the other nearly a^l of two planks renewed both had been attacked by worm. These Cr=ft had been lyin^ for eighteen months in the same basin as the 4^ feot craft mentioned. It can only be presumed that the above craft are in similar to condition as ours as they were not examined on a slip. It is re^re^ted that full information cannot be riven on this point, but Windlasses, Wheel houses. Steering gear and Rudders are present. It is thoughtthat propellers and shafts are fitted but these would have to be chanped if Kelvins were fitted. It is not certain if masts are still •on board. Basically the craft are the same as the Illustra tions in 'The Motor Boat and Yachting'. It is considered that the G,4 Kelvin can easily be fitted to these craft. The report from Gill A Fidele Ltd., states that this craft is in excellent condition without mentioning the Engine particularly. The Atlantic Diesel Engine is a good make and this craft is considered, subject to survey, a good proposition. It is not certain whether Hulls of the five craft are fitted with lavatories and wash places. It is regretted that the above information is not complete but the writer was not particularly interested in these craft during his visit to India and a brief' visit only was paid to them. The craft would have to be slipped and surveyed before purchase. The craft have lain for some considerable time with the minimum attention, as had those purchased by this Company. Decks would have to isTxm be recaulked for instance and the Wheel house repaired, windows, missing etc. They look terrible at first glance but upon closer examination they would seem to be basically sound In the other hand the 45 1 boat with Atlantic Engine is ready for Service and only perhaps minor alteration would have to be made as the cargo hold is cork insulated at present. This Craft is recommended in preference to the others. Cpd:PKN Sd/- xx %D.O.No. . POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 14th September, 1948.

I would like a surveyor's report on them and a statement whether anyone of them is in good enough condition to be worth fitting with an engine and spending money on its repairs.

An estimate of the cost of repairing any hull recommended, of doing any fitting out required, of fitting the engine and of the cost of the transport of the latter to BomVay and of the completed vessel to Bahrain would also be very useful. 3.

The figures shown above will be the same for Sharjah with the exception that there an effort will be made to en- k A gage a driver at the sanctioned rate. The crew shown above is of course not large enough for a sea-going launch in these waters. An effort will be made to see if Farrashes (messengers) can be used effectively to supplement it. Expenditure on petrol, spare parts, replacements, and maintenance is estimated at the very least at Rs.400/- a month. This includes provision for food which it is customary to give free to the crew while at sea.

'il Dear Tiltoru I have seen here the 'Wardah' which you got for Mohammed Taher A1 Sharif and the letter written by you to Ahmed Kanoo, and it has struck me that you might be able and willing to help me in my search for a replace ment for the Agency launch which was wrecked some months ago, though the engine, a Kelvin G4 60 H.P., was salvaged. 2. Your letter to Ahmed Kanoo states that friends of yours have a launch similar to the 'Wardah' for sale, but even if the Treasury were willing to put up over £3000/-,! doubt whether it would be a suitable craft for , the our use, as I understand/engines require renewing, and the skin of the hull seems fairly thin. The lay-out of this craft is (I think you^who know the conditions here, will agree) suitable for touring about here - where what is required is accommodation for two or three Europeans and,by English standards, a comparatively large Arab crew, and possibly other Arabs. The former is provided forward and the latter could be made up in the large hold like space aft which I understand was used for recovered torpedoes. You will perhaps bear these considerations in mind if you decide to keep an eye open for a launch which might suit this Agency. 3, For a suitable launch I would recommend (though of course I cannot guarantee sanction) an expenditure of £3,000/- W .G.

Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., Bahrain.11 liCe. *(67/4/48) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 24th September, 1948* Please refer to your S.O letter (XA0510/34K2A(4/48)) of the 21st July, 1948, and especially paragraph 4. 2» We have written to the Political Agents at Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat, asking them to find ways and means of reducing expenditure of launches and will let you know the result in due course* 3. I enclose a report on the Residency launch ,, DIAPfA w by Logsdail, who may be regarded as an expert, since apart from being a Master Mariner he has had 30 years experience of all types of craft and is the Secretary for the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. It will be seen that although the 'DIANA' is sea-worthy in fair weather, she is not suitable for our purposes. The Foreign Ofi'ice inspectors also noted the need for a smart motor boat mainly to take the Resident and his staff out to call officially on naval vessels. They also saw for themselves the impracticability of the Political Resident sharing a launch with the Political Agent, Bahrain. The main deficiency in the 'DIANA' is the lack of a cabin* She is an open motor boat and is therefore most unsuitable for officers in uniform calling on ships in rainy weather or in choppy seas. She has a low free board and water is therefore shipped in considerable quantities when in rough seas. In the Royal Navy, launches required for similar purposes are fitted with cabins. 4. I have also consulted Logsdail regarding the replacement. He recommends a 30* foot launch with an 8* foot beam and 5 1 draught; in other respects, he agrees with the recoinmendations in our letter No. 1613-34/© dated the 19th June, 1948, to Establishment and Organisation Department. We have written to Sapper Industries asking them for quotations as no suitable craft is available locally or in Bombay. 6. I have replied regarding the Kuwait launch 'HUGH 3ISC0E' and a reply will follow shortly regarding the Sharjah launch to be named the 'TRENCHARD FOWLE' and the engine and salvaged gear of the 'FELDC JONES'. 6. The name of the Muscat launch is 'ARNOLD WILSON'. (A.L.A. Dredge) J.M. Fisher, Esquire, Establishment &amp; Organisation Dept., Foreign Office, London..

This launch is an open type river launch and not suitaole for tae work it p»rforms here. It has no cabin or shelter of any kind, from sand-storms rain or spasay. This is a great handicap to the people who have to use her for social calls to Naval vessels or any other function she may be comrissioned for. ihe is used by all the political Resident's Head-qukrters Officers on various duties. She is also dirty in a strong breeze and throws spray over from wind-veard. I strongly advise a dix'ferent type of launch for this harbour and recommend a cruiser type of launch of 30 feet fitted with a desiel engine with a fair turn of speed about 10 knots and more free board than the launch under report.

Logsdail, Secretary, P.G.L.S &amp; Ex-Marine Advisor to the Central Excise Department of Government of India. mS.O.No. fK- l+ 3/^, ^ POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 2£th November, 1948. o &gt; De^r Dredge, Since I returned from my last tour in the launch, I have given some thought to the standing orders for this Agency's launches, which, at my request, Hudson forwarded to you with his S.O.No.R-387-3/6, dated the 18th November, 1948, and which were of course based on those which you fr&amp;med for the 'Diana'. 2. These standing orders are no doubt as good as can be done towards trying to avoid accidents to a har bour motor boat or to a launch used as such, but they are really r?ther beside the point when dealing with a sea-going launch. NO rules would have saved the 'Felix Jones' sinking in last June when the Beams opened in a Shumal, and it may have been that nothing could have saved her when she was ultimately lost, though, as you will see from my memorandum No.R-138-3/6, dated the 24th June, 1948, I formed the opinion that the pilot might have done better. The fact is that to go to sea in the open Gulf in winter in a motor dhow is bound to have a certain amount of risk about it although this can be reduced by coasting and by only goin^ to sea when the weather signs are propitious - a practice that prolongs tours inordinately. The position is, as I see it, that if we are going to continue to use motor dhows, the risk of the loss will remain; if we want to avoid that risk, we must pay more in the first place and use more sea-worthy craft Major A.L.A.

As far as the financial risk is concerned I have tried to minimise it by Insuring the 'Trenchard Fowle' before I took it on my last trip to Qatar. 3, I should be glad to see the specifications of the motor cruiser which you told me the P.G.L.S. contem- plated buying.

Dear Mr. Pelly, Further to my letter of the 18th ultimo, I have now been able to make some enquiries for you and enclose herewith particulars of various Boats \vhich may be of interest to you. The Fishing Smack is probably quite ^pld, but^ it is stated she would convert easily. u Pertango &lt;% and the Harpado'seem to be • /'s the craft most suitable for your requirements however, and please let me know if you would like me to go further in the matter. You will note the 'Pertango' a converted pinnace similar to the craft shipped out to Ahmed Kanoo, and irom all accounts this Boat came through the V /ar with a very good record. My Brother was a member of the crew on one of them stationed in the Shetland Islands and they had to go out in all weathers to answer distress signals from air-craft which had been forced down in the sea. He says that the men always gave the Boats a good name and they were preferred to the fast rescue Launches also employed. They are very strongly constructed of Mahogany and will put up with any amount of rough treatment. If I do not have .occasion to write you again before Christmas, I take this opportunity of sending you my best wishes for Christmas and the New Year, and I know my .Vife would join me in giving you this message. Is Colonel Galldway quite well? Kindest, regards^ Yours sin iv\ v In reply to your enquiry, the vessel advertised @ £2500, is 'HAJRPADO', a 60 ft. seagoing central wheelhouse Motor Cruiser built by Short Bros, of Rochester in 1920. She has 12 ft. beam and 4*6' draft, and the engines are heavy duty Parsons, running on paraffin, with ample fuel tanks for cruising. The hull is copper sheathed, and when she was in our charge in the spring she was slipped and surveyed, and a very satisfactory report given. She is a thoroughly seaworthy sturdy type of vessel. Since leaving here she has made a 500 mile trip to Rotterdam. Her home port is Southwick, and the owner, Mr, B. B. Funnell of 15, Portland Gate, Portland Road, _ Hove, 3, would, I am sure, be pleased to give every facility for an inspection at your convalence. His telephone number is Portslar^e 8109. He has entirely furnished the interior with carpets, curtains etc., quite recently. The accommodation consists of Galley, Stateroom, Engine-room with skylight over. Saloon, Sleeping cabin, Foc f stle and toilet. The central wheelhouse has a stairway to below. All hatches, skylights, etc. are of teak. There is electric lighting throughout the ship from a separate Lighting Plant, Galor Gas cooking, electric navigation lights, auxilliary mast and sail, two anchors and cable etc. If she is the size and type of vessel for which you are looking, we feel sure you would not be wasting your time to make an appointment with Mr. Funnell to inspect.

I said I would be asking for your help in getting on as quickly as 1 possible with the job of obtaining one and I now write • • with definite proposals as to the steps I should like taken r if Sir Rupert agrees. I do not think he will object as he agreed with me that for reasons which I need not go Into here, tut of which you are aware it is more than ever necessary that the Political Agent should have X satisfactory sea transport. 2. I enclose copies of specifications of two motor cruisers viz. 'Petrnga' and 'Harpado'. They were sent to me by a friend of mine named Tllton whom Sir Rupert knows and who, I think, is unlikely to recommend us any thing not a sound bargain. This is what he writes of 'Petanga': , 'You will note the 'Petanga' is a converted 0 lnnace similar to the craft shipped out to Ahmed Kanoo, and from all accounts this boat came through the war with a very good record. My brother was a memter of the crew on one of them stationed in the Shetland Islands and they had to go out in all weathers to answer distress signals from aircraft which had been forced dov/n in the sea. He says that the men always gave the boats a eood name and they were preferred to the fast rescue launches also employed. They are very strongly constructed of Mahogany and will put up with any amount of rough treatment,' 3. 'Petanga' seems to me more suitable than 'Harpado' first of all because I have seen Ahmed Kanoo's Pinnace of the same type so thst I can picture what 'Petanga' after conversion will be like; and secondly - this is more im portant - 'Petanga' was built in 1941 while 'Harpado' although she Major A,Ii,A- Dredge, MBE, The Political Residency, Jufalr,she is a 'Short* boat and not, at th;t, a war time Job, Is nevertheless 28 years old, I am, however, far from suggesting that either of the e boats should be bought on my recommendation. Pro vided you a^ree that it is the course most likely to ob tain a satisfactory and expeditious result, I should be glad i as soon as possible, you would send the speci fications to the Foreign Office asking them to have the two boats surveyed (presumabl:, through the Admiralty) and, if the report of the survey is satisfactory, to obtain the Treasury sanction for the expenditure and have the craft selected sent out here. The freight will cost, 1 think, arout £600/-, I should, I think, be able to get alrout £1000/- for the salvaged engine of the 'Felix Jones' and this amount could then be set off against the expenditure on 'Petanga' or 'Harpado'. 5. 0 lease ask the Foreign Office to deal in this matter with Mr. W.C. Tilton of the firm of Messrs. P.B. Broomhall, Ltd., Rldgway House, 41 &amp; 42, King William Street, London, E .G.4, Telephone. Mansion House 8013 (2 lines). Telegrams, 'Pebebroom', Cannon, London. This I regard as Important. Tilton has taken a good deal of trouble in this matter and it would be wrons; to short circuit him. 6. Logsdail sent me a copy of specifications of the two launches which he saw in Bombay. The 30 ft. High Speed small one is unsuitable for deep sea wcrk and I do not think LogsdaiJ. can have realised what this Agency required when he recommended her. He thinks the price quoted Rs.100,000/- for 'Radha' is too much, but you seemed to think that it might be possible to get her cheeper and that then the Treasury sanction for her purchase might be obtained. #e might keep her as a second string in case 'Petenga' or 'Harpado' dodo net come of£ Meantime I should be elfid If yov could ask Logsdail for some more details about her, i.e., what is the accommodation below deck and how is she fitted out? Presumably she has a lighting set and a dinghey? I return her photographs and those of the other launch herewith.

In the days of the Steam Engine a steam operated ejector was in general use and did the job admirably though with a considerable waste of fresh water. Nowadays, where steam has been superseded by the Internal Combustion Engine, this medium is not available. Pumps of all kinds have been tried, but all are subject to troubles of choking up, undue wear or corrosion and failure to prime or pick up their water. The Ciljector suffers from none of these troubles. The Giljector Bilge and Washdown Pump Deals with the dirtiest bilge water on all types of craft, solving a most obstinate problem which has troubled marine engineers for some time. Provides deck wash-down water at the same time, if required, by means of a two-way open bottomed cock on the pump. Slime, fish-scales or anything of that nature within reason will pass through the ejector without difficulty. Pumps from one or more points in the bilge. The Giljector will not choke because only clean water passes through the pump.* Page 4 How the Giljector has been developed Our research department set about the problem with characteristic thoroughness, and from our many years experience in the design and manufacture of water turbines, centrifugal pumps and all kinds of hydraulic equipment we have developed a really efficient water-operated ejector. We use our famous CGC sea-water self- priming pump, driven by the engine, to draw water from the sea and to pass it through the ejector fitted with stainless steel nozzle and throat at a compara tive low pressure. FROM PUMP This causes a vacuum in the ejector which lifts the dirty water from the bilges and discharges it to the sea. THE BILGE WATER THEREFORE DOES NOT PASS THROUGH THE PUMP AT ALL, and provided that a reasonable strainer is fitted to the sea-water intake there will be no choking. The bilge suction cannot become airlocked. AIR IN THE INLET PIPE MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE GGG SELF- PRIMING PUMP, so there is always a steady supply of sea-water. c- The Giljector will not choke because only clean water passes through the pump.'I Page 5 /ON THE PUMP CAN BE USED FOR WASH-DOWN PURPOSES by means of a two-way open bottomed cock fitted on the discharge side of the pump. By adjusting the delivery to the wash-down and the ejector the one pump is used for pumping out the bilges and washing down the boat at the same time. THE DRIVE is taken from the engine by belt with a simple disengaging gear operated from deck level or at the pump. This is a much more satisfactory arrangement than a friction clutch or a fast and loose pulley. When the pump is not in use all parts of the mechanism are at rest, thus avoiding unnecessary wear. It is easily adjustable, inexpensive and needs only small amount of space. The pump can be bolted down with out slide rails on to a permanent base. It can be supplied with two-speed arrangement to suit all engine speeds, and to enable the pump to be operated with the engine idling. A standard lay-out of the complete unit as installed in many fishing boats is shown on page 7 of this leaflet. J I For all bilge pumping work the Ciljector is the answer to your problems. The units are made in two sizes based on the No. 125 and No. 200 CCC pumps whose capacities are shown on page 9. The Giljector will not choke because only clean water passes through the pump.Page 6 Maintenance is easy and simple MAINTENANCE LEAFLET. Normal servicing and mainten ance operations for the CCC Pump and Ciljector are described in the leaflet sent out with each unit. * 24-HOUR SERVICE. In cases where the pump, ejector or drive mechanism require major overhauls or repairs, these will be carried out within 24 hours from time of receipt by the makers. Our system of replaceable gun-metal pump impellers, distance and port pieces, and stainless steel ejector throat and nozzle parts ensures this. * The simplicity and robustness of the design are such, how ever, that long and trouble free service is given by every Cilject-or bilge pump unit. * In fact we predict confidently that when you have fitted a Ciljector bilge pump unit your troubles will go over the side as easily as the bilge water. The Ciljector will not choke because only clean water passes through the pump.GGG 8 1947 Page 7 DESCRIPTION DISENGAGING DEVICE. SKIN Fl T TING A GRID. PLUG COCK. SEA WATER STRAINER.

(Hull) We refer to your letter No.M/33 of 15-11-48 passirgon to us the contents of a letter received by you from the Political Agent, Bahrein, asking for various particulars with regard to the M.F.V. which he proposes purchasing. We regret to advise that the creft in question f were badly damaged here during the recent severe cyclone and the Acting General Manager, Mazagon Dock Ltd., considers that the cost of the necessary repairs would be too high to make their purchase advisable. As a possible alternative, he suggests, for the consideration of the Politic&amp;l Agent, Bahrein, the M.F.V.^Vijay Laxmi'. This craft is now lying in our Yara and has been undergoing general repairs at the (expense of the present owner, Mrs. Moose. This lady offers the craft for sale at Ss30,000/-, but is prepared to consider a counter offer. The 'Vijay Laxmi' has a 65 H.P., 6 cylinder Atlantic diesel engine, giving a speed of about 7 knots at an estimated fuel consumption of 3 gallons per hour. Two 50 gallon fuel tanks are fitted in the craft. This craft is complete in every respect and is in fair condition. She is free from worga and fitted with a wheelhouse, steering gear, compass etc. A mast is fitted and derrick gear exists but thederrick itself is missing and will need to be replaced. She is not fitted with lavatories or wash-places, but these could be installed. Her overall length is 51' 6% beam 15*, depth 7 f and weight 25 tons. We are of the opinion that she is perfectly capable of sailing from Bombay to Bahrein on her own keel during the fair season, but would advise that freight for the carriage of this launch on deck from Bombay to Bahrein would be Rs5,000/- in full. As Mrs. Moose states that she has hed several offers in Bombay for this launch, we shall be obliged if you will let usknow as soon as possible by Air Mail whether the Political Agent at your port is interested in the purchase of this craft. Yours faithfully, Her 4 Co, Managing Agents.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002b7_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1088</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002b7</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1088</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File No 3/6 III Bahrain Agency Launch'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1944/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-14T11:35:36</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (331 folios)</extent><extent>The contents of the file have been arranged chronologically according to their date of issue from or receipt at the Bahrain Political Agency.Folios 290-334 are file notes, and include folio references in the margins enabling the notes to be used as an index.</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation sequence in use consists of a number, written in pencil, in the top right hand corner of the recto of each folio.
