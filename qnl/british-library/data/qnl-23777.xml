WMM THE BAHRAIN SPORTS CLUB. 1 . Three years ago, the Bahrain Sports Club had on its rdlls about thirty, whereas at the end of January 1937 it had 70 members. Membership is open to all persons resident in Bahrain - in other words, it is a cosmopolitan club. Members are balloted for. 2. In about 1934 the question of a Club House was mooted; but owing to the lack of money and the want of enthusiasm the question was shelved. It now transpires that a house may not be available for the rent the Club can afford to pay. 3. (a) The Club wishes to centralize its activities - indeed, it would be a great boon if it can have a Club House with tennis and badminton courts attached, in the vicinity of the hockey and football grounds near the Palace. (b) At present its chief activity is outdoor games. Apart from this, there is no place where indoor games (ping-pong, bridge, chess, draughts, etc.) or reading can be indulged in in members’ spare time. (c) When the Club has a social function, General or Committee meetings, it has unavoidably to depend upon the generosity of one of its members for the loan of his premises. In the past this was practicable; in the future it will be problematical, owing to the increase in membership. (d) iHnirii iagSgSKM KSWKK 11 (d) In winter and summer, when out- door games are not possible, members are at IBfL 1 a loose end: if the Club boasted a common U0f meeting place, relaxation could be had in the form of reading, etc. ===«=«= 4* Bahrain affords no amenities what- EHSm! soever to the subordinate employees of iUfs^ Government offices and mercantile houses: IHMISl? some relaxation after work, especially in the trying climatical conditions of Bahrain, wWM* is felt to be essential for reasons of health. In other stations in the Gulf some sort of Club (with a common meeting-place) exists: Bahrain sadly lacks this social necessity. The Bahrain Sports Club wishes to supply this long-felt want. May I be permitted to point out that the Bush ire Hesidancy have their own Club: there is also a Library: the Honourable the Political Resident has been so good as to permit the members to use a portion of the Town Residency as a Club Room. (May I also add that membership is not restricted to the staff of the Residency, but many persons belonging to the Bank of Iran and Mespers, etc. are also members.) 5. The growth of Bahrain, commercially speaking, is very evident. This is due principally to the recruitment by The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited of foreign labour from India and f Iraq. Many of the Company^ Class II employees are members of the Sports Club owing to the Company not being in a position to give their Class II employees a Club House, tennis, or other spare time recreational/- 3 - I recreational facilities. 6 . By the foregoing I have tried to show as concisely as possible, the necessity for a Club House for the Sports Club where members can inake good use of their spare time. 7. May I state that the Club has no funds with which to purchase a plot of land; this is due to subscriptions being kept as low as possible and, in consequence, expendi ture is just about covered by earnings. The the Club will raise donations if one oghlternatives contained in paragraph 8 meets with approval. 8 . Keeping these facts in mind, I beg to formulate the following proposals for your sympathetic consideration and assistance, Sir. (A) To consider the grant by the Bahrain Government of a long-term lease, of not less than twentyfive years* duration, for a plot of land 220 feet by 150 feet near the Palace. OR (B) To consider the free grant by His Excellency the Rulerof Bahrain of a plot of land 220 feet by 150 feet in place of or on the present site (thirty feet by thirty feet) which was granted free in about the year 1929, near the Palace. The free grant if made will be large enough to accommodate a Club Houses two tennis and two badminton courts. Please see rough plan attached. OR/EyaeiM^HHsns (C) To consider the possibility of the Club purchasing the plot requested in alternative (A) or alternative (B) in this paragraph in say four instal ments, for the reasons given in paragraph 7 supra. 9. If either 8(B) or 8(C) is granted, in about five years 1 time or sooner, depend ent always on the collection of funds to carry out building operations, the Club’s tennis courts in the Baladiyeh Gardens in Manamah would be given up. It is submitted for consideration whether the Bahrain Government or the Manamah Baladiyeh would pay the Club Rs. 1000/- (or near offer) as a return for the concrete foundation put down for the two courts. This request if made later officially must not be misunderstood since it v/ould be made solely because the Club wants funds. The Club would not, however, presd this point if either alternative (B) or (C) of paragraph 8 were agreed to. (For your information No. 1 Court was recently repaired (to the foundation) at a cost of Rs. 1000/-). I feel certain that the Club will agree in case alternative 8(C) is granted, that if the Club at any time wished to close down its activities, the plot of ground would revert to the Bahrain Government on repayment by the latter of the purchase price. 10*» To sum up : (a) The monthly subscription of Rs./ ■ Of — iSSSSsi I 11 S1 - 5 - 9 Rs. 1-8-0 per member precludes the Club from building up a Reserve Fund: the earnings and expenditure are just about balanced. (b) Owing to the increase in member ship and to the fact that the Club wishes to centralize its activities and give up the practice of begging members for the loan of their premisesjfor social functions or Meetings, a Club House is considered to be essential ( if possible, with tennis courts, etc. attached). (c) Although it may be possible to rent a house for use as a Club House (there is a proposal that the Club should take up a portion of the house which the Political Resident wishes to rent for his staff), the house may have to be given up at short notice, especially if and when the Residency is transfen^ed to Bahrain. The situation then will be no better than what it is now - in fact, the loss of the Club House would be felt all the more. (d) I therefore beg that alternative (B) or (C) of paragraph 8 be given your sympathetic consideration and support. 11* If one of the alternatives set out in paragraph 8 above meets with your approval, the Club would write in officially. The Club would also commence collecting donations for the necessary building, tennis courts, etc./ mmn ' x 3 6 - ~ aaB ps e a etc., irres pective of its renting premises as a temporary Club House. Of course, it must be borne in mind that in any event the iaS S^j g Club House on the site wMch may be granted through your good offices will not be ready ;s::is before at least two years as much depends on i mz- the collection of funds. Though this note has not been liuppl 1 circulated to any members of the Sports Club (mention has been made of the contents to two important members of the Managing Committee who have my confidence), may I be permitted to offer you, Sir, our profound gratitude and humble thanks for your endeavours to assist the Club.

This demand from the Hanicipality has come to us at a most inopportune moment in view of the fact that the existing finances of the Club do not permit us to construct our own courts on the property the Bahrain Government has been good enough bo give on a long lease. It would have bean possible for the members of our Club to contribute towards the construction of new Tennis Courts but this is not the right time to concentrate our energies in this direction when a more vital issue such as the n WAH EFFORT' is receiving the serious attention of the members. The Club members are straining all their nerves to contribute us much as possible for the more noble and. immediate cause n WAR BELIEF FUND' end good progress has already been made in this respect. We, therefore, request that you -Till be kind enough to persuade the Honieipality co permit us to continue using rlie present ^annls Courts in the Bsladiynh Gardens until such time we construct our own Courts which will not be long after the cessation of the pres on s hostilities, if not earlier. Whilst the icsniberu feel that they would be able to raise some funds for the Teruds Courts, it is the coiicsacus of opinion that every pie we are able to collect should be utilised towards the 'WAR EFFORT n und every member of our Club is united in this decision. In view of the foregoing, wo trust that our request for an extension of the lease on the Tennis Courts will be granted.V Shaikh Abdullah bin ! Isa al Khalifah, President, Manama Municipality. After Compliments I have received a letter from the Bahrain Sports Club informing me that they have had ah intimation from the Secretary of the Manama aiuni- cipality that the iTease granted to them for the tennis courts in the Baladiya garden will not be renewed. The members of the Sports Club inform me that owing to their contributions to the Empire’s War Effort they would find it very difiicult to collect money to make new r tennis courts for themselves and they beg that if it is at all possible the lease for the courts in the Baladiyah garden may be renewed until the end of the war. 2 . I am sure that you will agree with me in sympathising with the members of the Club, and I earnestly hope that it will be possible to allow them to have a renewal of the lease so long as the war lasts. The membership of the Club is open to all communities and at a time like this it is very necessary for us to do what we can to ensure that any recreations tnat have been enjoyed in the past ) should continue to beavailable. In these circums tances I nope that perhaps the Manama Baladiyah will find It possible to reconsider their decision. Usual Ending. P. A. Bahrain. 3x5The Bahrain Sports Club Bahrain.

We beg to refer you to our letter dated the 11th August last attached to which we sent you our cheque for Rs.lJ as contribution for the War Effort. We are^resent in a flimsy footing in regard tennis courts which are in a very poor condition and a leased to us by the Baladyah, only for the duration oy war on a monthly rental of Rs.10/-. On this basis we feel that it would be improper for us to spend any large sums of money on repairs as sooner or later we will have to hand over the courts to the Bahrain Municipality. 4/- •4 e 7 our It is our great desire, therefore, to put up two new courts on the grounds so generously leased to us by H.l. the Shaikh of Bahrain. v Needless to say that to accomplish this object we need more funds as the present finances of the Club do not permit any major construction such as this. A little over a year ago we had hoped that we would be able to construct these courts out of the voluntary donations from our members and well-wishers, but the Managing Committee are now experiencing some sort of hesitation on the part of the members presumably owing to uncertainty^of their jobs or longer stay in Bahrain although tennis section is the sine qua non of the Club and without which we anticipate a very heavy fall in the membership. V/e are therefore obliged to seek ways and means of raising funds for the construction of these courts and beg to approach you with a view to obtaining your permission to bring up a Fancy Fete in our Club at the beginning of December for 8 to 10 days on the same lines as in July last, except, of course, that the activities will be confined indoors because of the 'black-out' restrictions and will be confined to Club members only.It is also the intention of the Managing Committee to contribute a portion of the proceeds of this Fancy Fete towards the P.G.F.F.
