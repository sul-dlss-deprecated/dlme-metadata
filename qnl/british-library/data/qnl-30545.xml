A brief account of the work done by the British Council office inBeirut in connection with the appointment of teachers to the States of the Persian Gulf during the summer 1950, I PERSIAN GULF STATES. 1. Bahrain . The requests from Bahrain includea the recruitment of teachers for the Government Boys and Girls schools, and for the Technical school. x1 he Director of Education, Mr. Ahmad Al-Omran, arrived in early July and an office here was put at his disposal, and letters of application which were received in great numbers were passed on to him and he interviewed applicants. Apart from his two visits to Cairo to consult the Egyptian Minister of Education and to attend the Arab league Cultural Meeting he spent two hours per morning for several weeks selecting candidates. His chief difficulty was that 8 of the Palestinians that he had appointed last year had resigned because the Government would not pay their fares each year to Lebanon. This set the orob- lem of a very careful selection of Palestinians and in the event not many were suitably qualified and finally his can didates were selected from 4 Lebanese and Palestinians. The Headmaster of the Technical School was also in Lebanon; assistance was given to him to find a teacher from among the applicants. The Inspectress of Girls schools was also spending the summer with her family in Beirut and did her own recruit ment,but the appointment of a Headmistress for one of the schools still remains unsettled and attempts are being made to find one. 2. Kuwait. The nev/ly appointed Director ol Education, Mr. Darwish Miqdadi, although living in Damascus, was frequently in Beirut for consultation. His appointment raised a question from the British Legation in Beirut because of his politi cal past but fortunately documents were available from Kuwait to show t^at they had already examined this question and v/ere satisfied with the appointmeno. The withdrawal of the Egyptian Director and the appointment of Miqdadi, a Palestinian, was a cause of displeasure to the Egyptian Government who withdrew all their teachers. Miqdadi was therefore faced with the appointment of more than a hundred new teachers. His advertisement and the salary he was offering brought over 1 ,200 applicants from these countries. This, however, was not handled in the British Council Office Arrangements were made for placing two of the sons of Shaikh Abdullah Jabir, Minister of Justice and Education in Kuwait, in the Preparatory Schoolof the American Univer sity in Beirut. An attempt was made to persuade the Shaikh to keep them in Kuwait until they had finished their secondary education but he was anxious that the Represen tative here should keep some supervision over his two sons and they arrived on October the 3rd. /3 Musgat. . . . ... ; . . . . . .3. Muscat . The Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, Col, Woods-Ballard, asked for the appoint ment of teachers for ^uscat and Salalah: for the former three teachers, and the latter one headmaster and two teachers. He requested that correspondence should be carried directly between this office and himself. We were informed by the Director in Bahrain that the Headmaster of the Muscat School had applied to him and, therefore, a new headmaster would be required. The Sultan’s demand that they should possess teachers’ training certificates made recruitment very difficult as most of the Palestinians with these quali fications had already found employment and the certificates issued in Lebanon are not of the standard of those of the late Palestine Government. Being unable to find sufficient good candidates in Beirut, 1 asked ^uhammad Hunaidi, an old Council student whose name 1 had put forward for the headmastership of Salalah, to explore the sources of recruit ment in Amman. There was no Council Representative in Amman at the time and I was obliged to send ^r. Hack, our Functio nal Officer, to supervise the interviews. An advertisement in the paper for Muscat and elsewhere produced more than 600 applications and over a hundred were interviewed. The applications were sorted and filed in this office. It is to be regretted that there was an uncomfortable legacy of callers at the Council in ^mnan, but in the circumstances this could not be helped. A Lebanese headmaster of consi derable experience was chosen for Muscat, his knowledge of English was unfortunately very small and at Muscat’s request I sent a Palestinian with a good knowledge of English to assist him. Muhammad Hunaidi who had been engaged for one year in educational work in Yemen was strongly recommended for Salalah because of his wide interests and the possibility of his being able to coach the son of the Sultan whose educa tion in Beirut had been recommended by the Political Resident. He, however, suggested too high a salary and it was consi dered in Muscat that he was too young and lacked length of experience. The appointment of the junior staff for Salalah was held over pending that of the Headmaster. This problem awaits further instructions from Muscat.

In confirmation, the text was:- C /6 3&gt; (I^m) 'POLITICAL AGENT MUSCAT FROM KSIGUT RECa.HEtJD STRONG SUPPORT OP HUTTSIDI FOR HEAEf.IASTSR DHUFSR V/ITH WOODSBALLAHD OR RASAS r 1 . To complete the picture, Highwood, our Representative, Lebanon, is giving valuable assistance in the recruiting of teachers for the Persian Gulf. He v/rote to me giving an interim report on this and I quote from his letter to the Minister of Foreign Affair's, Muscat, the section referring to Huneidi, whom he proposed for Headmaster, Dhufar: A ■ / 4/0 f /l ^ /lU/Mhod. . k./J- f/O- n I most strongly reconmend Mohammed rorehim Huneidi rvhom I have known personally for t\-/o years when he was at our Hostel. I was particularly impressed by his energy and practical ability in assisting the Palestine refugees. I had a long tall: with him yesterday on his return from Yemen. He occupied the post of Director of Education in Taiz, which means that he was in charge of the Ahmadiyeh schools run by the Imam’s family. He is modest, but from his account he seems to have accomplished a great deal in one year. You will probably question his experience and age for he is only 27, but I believe it will be very difficult to find a better man for the post, and it should be reme’ibered that he was working with the Palestine Government and gave up temporarilj’’ his career in order to become better qualified at the University. He is very interested in the Arabian Peninsula and would probably staj^ in Dhofar for two years. He is a scientist and 1ms wide interests. He himself taught 35 periods a week in addition to his administration; he difl translation work for the Imam’s Foreign Office and for a short period edited the Yemen official newspaper. He wrote History and Geography books for his schools and (unofficially) gave private instruction to the crown prince. He was nearly selected for the Border Delegation which went to Great Britain. I quote these as examples of his energy and interests which are in contrast to the lack of enthusiasm shown by many other Palestinians. He paid a visit to Aden and Lahaj where he met Seager and Marsack, and a number of other British officials whom he had known in the Administration in Palestine. I understand that they are anxious for him to go hack to that part and I would, therefore, recommend that you communicate with Aden both for reference and if you wish to appoint him. The climate of Taiz is very unhealthy and, although he was asked to stay, his health did not pemit it. Major Chauncey, Political Agency, Muscat.
