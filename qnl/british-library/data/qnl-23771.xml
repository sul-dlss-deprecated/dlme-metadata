VI 6/5, dated thG 24 th November 1 J 26 , about Diaries which the Senior Naval Officer asked you for, I protested to Barry both about this matter and about his ordering the commander of a sloop to take from the new Shaikh of Abu Dhabi an agreement which I had not asked for, pending the receipt of the Government of India T s views. Barry accepted the remonstrance with very good grace. I now enclose for your information and guidance a copy of my letter^ just issuing, to the Naval Intelligence Cf^l* cer ; Colombo. I think that you might quietly drop the send- ing of your copy to S.N.C also. He will not get one from Ku wait or Muscat and should generally be satisfied with the Bus- hire monthly. Cn the other hand, please remember always to send to Bushire your reports in triplicate whenever there is a lile* lihood of my sending copies on to the Government of India. My letters with enclosures all have to go in duplicate to Foreign. h/L-tl-. If ever your report^dito should be communicated to r the Senior Naval Officer quickly, I would like an additional ( fourth ) copy, which can if necessary forestall the copy of my monthly summary sent to the Senior Naval Officer.

On learning t v at he did not, I premised to send him a copy direct, as I felt that it would be helpful to him. -r——' I receive half-monthly summaries from various j. clitioal Agencies and Consulates, which are under my control in the Persian Gulf Administration, such as Pusoat, Bahrain, Kuwait, liuhammorah and Bander Abbas etc. ?/y monthly summary incorporates all the news of any importance contained in these officers 1 reports. Later, I found that the Senior Jiaval Officer, after visiting Bahrain, had asked the Political Agent direct for a copy of his half-monthly summary and also requested that a copy be sent to you direct. I consider this unnecessary and have vetoed it as far as you are concerned. The Politi cal Agents' reports go to no superior officer except through me. Amongst themselves they naturally interchange news in a minor degree, for instance Kuwait sends copies to Luhammer- ah and Bahrain, but this is apurely a departmental arrange ment# I hope you will be satisfied to receive all the Bahrain news in my monthly issue, as are Army Headquarters, India, and the Foreign and Political Department. I will see to it that the Senior Kaval Officer gets early information of everything that can be of interest to him.

The correspondence specifically concerns a request from the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station, and the Senior Officer (Intelligence) at Colombo, for a copy of the Bahrain political diary. The request is protested against and vetoed by the Political Resident, who states that his own monthly summaries, which collate information from his Political Agents’ diaries, should suffice. A later letter in the file, from the Secretary to the Political Resident to his Political Agents, dated 3 January 1929, refers to submissions of a fortnightly diary by the Residency Agent at Sharjah (f 9).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Diaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000f6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
