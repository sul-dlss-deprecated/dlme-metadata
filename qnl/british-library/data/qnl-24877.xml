You will see that the Foreign Office stated in their t elegram of 22 nd Decembex to the Acting Consul- General^thiPr visas areHbot required for any passengers, whatever their nationality, who are in possession of Nf- through tickets. We have, however, recently heard from Ford, our Assistant Chinese Secretary, who is on his way to England on leave that he and other official travellers (e.g. Thomas, our retiring Financial Counsellor) have had great difficulties with the B.O.A.C. office in Calcutta owing to the fact that the endorsements on their passports did not include Bahrein. Ford had to pay a special visit to the Passport Office of the Bengal Secretariat to get Bahrein included, as the B.O.A.C. refused to sell him a ticket without it. Ford adds that at first the B.O.A.C. wanted to make him get the whole endorsement again from the Passport Office, because the . ^'-latter affix theirs by means of a rubber stamp headed ^ uir and that he only succeeded in getting l/v, round^this eventually because of his official status. The ^' '• apparently take the view that an ’’endorsement u ^adequate and that a ’’TRANSIT VISA” is essential! /We The External Affairs Department, New Delhi.n • f i £ We and the Consul-General have hitherto been giving visas for Iraq to all through passengers (although this is not strictly necessary) and we will now make all visas and endorsements valid for Bahrein in transit until the position is clarified. In the meantime we should be grateful if you could have the matter taken up with the B.O.A.C. so that they may cease making these unnecessary requirements. It might also be pointed out to the Bengal Secretariat Passport Office, after that matter has been cleared with the B.O.A.C., that it is inappropriate to issue visas for Bahrein to British subjects.
