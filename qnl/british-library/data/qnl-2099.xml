Belgrave's letter is presumably in reply to a communication from the Politica ent following on the Resident's telegram to him No.1170 24th December (copy sent to you under our printed letter P.Z,8266/33). In view of it we appear now to be in a position to make a communication to the Company on the subject ana it seems hardly necessary to wait for any further comment from the Political Hesident. 2. I would propose, in these circumstances, if you and the other interestea departments agree, to write to Ballantyne on the general lines that both we and the sheikh ^ ,, had/ Ct- starling, Esq., Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, 3.7/. 1. listhad hitherto assumed that the Company proposed to refine locally, and that this heing so we had not made any reference to refining arrangements in communicating to them the amendments desired In the mining lease; that Ivir.Skinner's recent communication to the Sheikh made it clear that this was not the case, although the Company might consider the matter at a later date, that the sneikh had asked that the matter should he taken up with them, and that while we recognised that they were under no specific ooligation to refine locally we should he glaa, in view of the importance of the point to the Sheikh, to know what assurance they could give us in the matter. 3.

My dear Starling, You will have seen the Resident's letter of 18th m December, 1935-S, and connected correspondence ahout the 1 / request of the Bahrein Petroleum Company to be permitted to acquire the land in Sitra Island detailed in paragraph 7 of L t 43 Skinner's letter of ?th December 1933, and the reservation iwS of certain other land elsewhere referred to in paragraph 9 of Skinner's letter of the same date. 2. We agree,in the first place, with the local Dolitical authorities, that the Company have no right ?ii - - ■ ■ ■ except under Schedule II Article II, to acquire or to reserve land unless and until they take out a mining lease, and from 1^7 the Resident's telegram of 23rd December, No. 1165, it looks i ' . I as though the Company no longer took an opposite view. 3. On the question whether there is any substance in Skinner's suggestion that they can claim to acquire land under the prospecting licence in the terms of paragraph 7 of his letter of Vth December to the Political Agent, Bahrein, I enclose: copy of a note hy our Legal Adviser. Subject to your views on the question oi what works*..••••••may he necessary for the purp.se of prespecting' and the necessity 1; of reasonable facilities f.r storage, it seems on the whole (particularly as the C.mpany themselves (cf.Powle's telegram [ of 83rA December, 1165) do not apparently regard themselves as i; entitled as of right to acauire land and if, as suggested below, we are prepared to meet them over the acquisition of B ' land/ Starling Esq., | Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, o.n-i.land on Sitra) t-hat we should be on reasonably sure ground in taking the line in the first instance, if w e wished to do so for bargaining purposes, that they were not entitled to acquire land until the mining lease had been taken out, 4. Secondly, it seems to us quite clear that, subject k f cr the terms of the agreement of 81st November 1953, there 'tf(% can be no question that the Company must pay a royalty of Rs*3/8 per ton on any oil won by them during the period of the prospecting licence. The terms of the revised Article IX of the prospecting licence are categorinal on this point and from Loch's telegram No.20, of 14th January to the Political Resident, it appears that the Company themselves take it for granted that royalty will be payable. 5* We have now to consider what action to take in the light of the considerations mentioned above, which slightly alter the position discussed in the Resident's letter of 18th December. 6. In taking our decision we must bear in mind that while the Company may not have the legal right to acquire or reserve areas at this stage it is very important (so long as i our own interests are secured) to do nothing which can be represented by the Company as justifying a delay on their part in reaching the stage of active production and s# postponing the date by which the Sheikh can expect to receive royalty consequent on commercial production having been attained. 7. The position is complicated by the fact that the areas which Holmes wished to reserve on behalf of tte for the reservation of which application is 5 hi Company and till/i i iiii m mi n / $ still being made by the Company, appear to include part of at least one of the areas which we are now arranging to acquire for Government purposes( area^l). 8. Our general disposition here would I think on the whole he, in the light of the considerations above, in the first place to inform the Company that in our view tkey are not entitled to acquire or reserve land in advance of the taking out of the mining lease, save as a matter of special arrangement. Secondly, that the Sheikh, as a special concession, would, however, be prepared to allow them to take up the two areas of land on Sitra Island referred to in paragraph 7 of Skinner 1 a letter of 7th December 1953, but that in doing so he wishes to remind the Company that this will, represent a special concession; that, as they are aware, he has communicated to them his desiderata In regard to the amendment of the mining lease, and that It must be clearly understood that In acceding to their request in this matter he does so on the understanding that due account will be given to the fact that he has done so when his proposals for the amendment of the mining lease are being considered. Thirdly, that the Sheikh is not prepared to consider any application for the reservation of land unless and until the mining lease has been taken out. Action on these lines, if it commended itself to the other Departments, would enabxe the Company to go ahead with the installation of their pumping, etc. arrangements on Sitra, and would leave us entirely free as regards the reservation of land. It might of course, be possible to demand some more specific fluid -pr&gt; quo from the Company for the grant of land on Sitra Ihere we are rather in a cleft stick because of our anxiety to give the Company no excuse for delaying production and so delaying payment of the increased royalties to the Sheikh, and on the whole the course suggested above seems the 'best compromise in the circumstances. 9. Would you let me know whether you are' in general agreement with the course of action proposed, so that, in the light of your views and those of the other Departments, we can telegraph to the Resident. The opportunity might be taken to ask the Resident to let us have a copy of the map stated to have been submitted by Holmes with his application of May 1932, and of any similar maps which maybe submitted in the future. 10. I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner at the Foreign Office and to Seal at the Admiralty, with a request for an expressicnof their views. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.G-. LAITHWAITE.'&lt; / Extract from Note by Legal Adviser, India Office, dated 19th January, 1934. This depends on the construction of the prospecting license. Is it reasonable to say that what the Company now proposes is within the Clause II 'to carry out such works as may be necessary for the purpose of prospecting The letter of 7th December from the Company f s local representative speaks of 'testing the capacity of an oil field by actually flowing the wells'• Apart from what the experts might say, it would seem reasonable that the prospecting license should be construed to include the carrying out of tests sufficient to put the licensee in a position to decide whether to exercise his option or not. Further than this, it is clear from Clause IX of Schedule II that it is in contemplation that oil shall be won during the period, and a royalty paid for any quantity in excess of 100 tons. This may appear to indicate that the Company should be allowed reasonable facilities for storage or disposal even during the prospecting period, and may involve a construction of Clause II broad enough to cover it. On the other hand it seems more reasonable to say that although Clause IX is unrestricted as to the amount of oil that may be got, it would not be possible for the Company to invoke Clause II, as regards the land in respect of any quantity of oil won in excess of what might be necessary for a reasonable test: in other words, once they embarked on a commercial working of the field over and above what was necessary for a reasonable test, they would have to look elsewhere than Clause II: i-e. a separate arrangement, or await the mining lease. It is possible that this position has been somewhat weakened by the agreement of 21st November, 1933.-I COlTVIDTgriAI.. 7),0.:To.S-!5 of 1934 The Residency, BUSHIHB, 2nd January 1934 DC r to your ^Vinted Letter Ho # '.Z.7668/33 containing a Bote of an interview with Mr. Ballantyne as to the interpretation of Clause 5 of the ]?irst Schedule to the Bahrain Oil ConcesBion - Customs Exemption. I think that ITr.Ballant^e 1 s suggestion in paragraph 4 of the Note is the best solution, i,e. that Loch, Skinner and Bel grave should try to come to a friendly understanding and embody an agreement as to the articles which the Company be allowed to import free of duty, and v;hen Mr, Ballantyne gets a reply from San ?raT3cisco (paragraph 5 of the Note) this understanding can be got under way# S.

Vie assume, of course, that in the perhaps improbable event of the Sheikh's final letter being so worded as to expose surface or be likely to cause us embarrassment it vrould be possible for the political iigent to persuade him to make any modification which might be thought desirable before it was communicated to the Company. 3.

Dear Captain Lawson, As you may be aware, the Bahrein petroleum Company are engaged in developing an oil concession which has been granted to them by the Sheikh of Bahrein. Under the terms (which date from 1925) of their concession they are entitled in certain circumstances on taking out a mining lease to erect 'telegraph apparatus of all kinds' so far as may be necessary for the purpose oi their ouslness. iney have not yet taken out a mining lease, though they, have to reach a decision as to whether or not to do so by not later than January 1935. But they have now asked permission, In connection with the installation of a submarine oil loading and shipping terminal, to use a radio telephone transmitter on 10 metres or less, using up to 3 watts. The Sheikh has intimated that he has no objection to action on these lines, so long as the wireless telephon® in Question do ■ r not/' captain Lawson, Imperial and International Communications, Ltd., Electra House, Victoria Embankment, W.'C.. 2.CP not interfere with the installations of Imperial and International Conmunications or Imperial Airways and so long as they are not used for transmission to stations outside Bahrein. 2. The Company are represented in this country hy Mr. H.K. Ballantyne, whose offices are at 19 Moorgate, E.C.2. I understand that the Company will gladly comply with the Sheikh's stipulations, hut are anxious to know how best to secure that there shall he no interference with your installations or with those of Imperial Airways Ltd. If there is likely to be any difficulty in securing this, perhaps the simplest course would be that . . Mr. Ballantyne should be placed in direct touch with you with a view to discussing the matter. But if apparatus of the nature they mention would be Insufficiently powerful to Interfere, perhaps discussion would be unnecessary and on receipt of a reply from you and from the Air Ministry we could inform the Company, if this was agreed, that so long as their apparatus was on 10 metres or less, and using not more than 3 watts there woula be no danger of interference, but that with a view to keeping within the terms of the Sheikh's permission, they should consult us further/0 - 3 - 1 further if and when any alteration was contemplated. 3, We should he glad of your observations in the matter to enable a decision to he reached. I ought to add that we have impressed on Mr. Ballantyne (with reference to the Sheikh's sacona stipulation referred to above) that for the purposes of conmunication outside the Islands we consider that the facilities afforded hy Imperial and International Coianunicatlons Limited should De employed.

Following my •all upon you on the 4th instant, I am now desired by this Company to inform you that whilst the India Office would not, on the one hand, admit any contention that the relevant provisions in the Concession Agreement of 2nd December 1925 permit of the entry into B&amp;hrein, free of import duties, of house furnishings, food, sports and games requisites, it must respectfully urge, on the other hani., that the dral^htsman surely contemplated that for prospecting, exploring and development works by English, American and other foreign elements, it would be necessary not only to give them a house to live in but to furnish the house with essentials, and also to provide them with foods they had be«x used to, and the means for preserving such foods# / The recreation facilities is a more open question. It would appear, however, that the Company has already given way and paid duty on food imported and on games and other means of recreation for the employees; and it would be a lamentable thing.if this question were allowed to become one of importance or a source of friction between the Company and the Local Authorities of the Government of Bahrein. J*G. Laithwaite Esq., Accordingly,/ India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.-2- Accordingly, I am to suggest to you that whilst you maintain your strict attitude on the question of construction and the Company does the same, the Company, through its Local Representative, should endeavour to settle the questions of the outstanding duties with the Local Authorities concerned on the broad principle of give and take* The furnishing of the Manager's house at Manama seems, from what I can understand, to 'be at the root of the present position, and if that is so, there should 'be little difficulty in sorting out what is an essential furnishing for the Manager, as an employee, leaving th« rest of the furnishings to he regarded as 'luxuries', and taxable. I think we have decided that motor cars used by or in the course of the Company 1 s business do not enter int# the question; they are obviously a part of the Company's equipment, and as such, non-dutiable. If it is convenient to you to communicate with Bahrein by letter at the end of this week, and you will let me know by telephone, I will write on the lines of this letter to Mr.Skinner as the Company's Chief Local Representative, asking him to deal with and settle thesf outstanding import duty questions# Yours, Sec9, (Sgd.).

I have also heard this morning from the Company to the effect tnat the largest ship used would be one whose carrying capacity is 130,000 barrels of oil and which would have a draft of 32 feet. As it transpired at our discussion at the Admiralty on Tuesday last, that the proposed channel is, at its snallowest part, not less than o9 feet deep, a further survey of the channel does not appear to be necessary.

It would also tie understood that these tmoys should not he removed or changed dy the Company without the previous consent of the Government of India. It may he that the Government of India have at their aisposal already and by way of reserve, huoys which could de utilised for the Company's purposes. If this were so, ana it would mean a saving of time, the Company would like to suggest that such duoys should de utilised and replaced, the cost of replacement heing reckoned as the cost of the supply of duoys. It woula de a convenience to the Company to know (a) the approximate cost of the duoys (d) the approximate cost of laying the duoys (c) the yearly cost of maintenance of the duoys, including the light and (d) when the work could de coirmenced and completed. I understand that the work of laying the sudmarire line with its sea terminal and the anchorage for ships using the terminal, will de undertaken under the super vision of the special Engineering party placed at the aisposal of the Company dy the Standard Oil Company of California. This party has apparently an extensive knowledge of this kind of work. Ihese Engineers or some of them will, I understand, arrive in London on the 4th January next en route for Bahrein.

(1) The meeting after discussion •f the line to 'be taken in the light of the / ^ telegram N®. dated December 1933 (copies circalated under P,Z. 8165/33) frcm the Political Agent, Bahrein,/on the subject of the intentions of the Bahrein Petroleum Company as regards local refining, concurred in a draft of instructions t« tke Political Hesid©nt/(des-oatdaed as India Office telegram 3173 of 22nd December') (2) Mr.Lait3awaite briefly explained the latest developments in connection with the request of the Bahrein Petroleum Company for the assistance of H .M.G. in surveying, ii 'buoying and lighting certain approaches tj Bahrein in connection with th... shipment af oil won hy them. As the result of discussion at the Admiralty it had 'been thought 'better, in the interests of avoiding any excuse for the introduction of U.S. naval personnel to conduct surveys, etc., and of keeping control of any lighting and 'buoying arrangements in British hands, to give the Company all possible/2m possible assistance on a repayment 'basis. It was now proposed, after discussion with the Company's representatives, to invite the tovernment of India, if they saw no objection,' to undertake 'Ih© necessary work, on a repayment basis so that, full control for any buoys laid would be secured t» Government. The Company had intimat#d that the Standard Oil Company of California had placed an expert party at their disposal who would arrive in London frem the U -S. A. en 4th January en route for Bahrein to deal with the question of the laying of the propesed submarine pipeline and the connected questions of laying moorages and floats. The meeting took note of the position. II. Qatar Oil Concession. The meeting resumed consideration of the revised oil concession communieated informally by the A.P.O.C. on 11th December 1933, in the light of the record of the discussion which had taken place with the representatives of the Company on 14th December, (P.Z.8218/33). Mr«Laithwaite said that, trie A.P.O.C. were pressing for the earliest possible indication of any amendments that H.M.G* might desire, in the interests of facilitating Mr.Chisholm*s negotiations in Qatar, and had been anxious for information before Christmas. That was impossible, but it seemed desirable to let them have a letter early next week. The meeting agreed. It/(B) ^ It was agreed that it would be best first to consider the general procedure to be adopted in negotiating with the Company and the Sheikh; secondly, the supplementary amendments, if any, to be suggested to the Company in Articles »f the revised draft concession other than Article 12; thirdly, Article 12 and the connected questions of British control, exclusive British exploitation of any concession granted (though this point strictly ar^se on Article 17), and the maintenance of a British Chief Local Representative of the Company in Qatar. The India Office wished to suggest consideration in this connection of certain special restrictions, arising out ®f political conditions in Qatar, v/hich would apply to all Companies applying for concessions whatever their nationality* III. A.Procedure, On the question of procedure , Mr*Laithwaite said that as the A.P.O-G. were apparently willing to cover certain points of special interest to H.M.Q. in an exch ang e of letters (which must of course be of a character binding on the Company and on any transferees or assignees), the simplest course, in the light of previous informal discussion withth« Foreign Office r and subject to the views of the meeting, appeared to be that there should be : (a) an agreement between-the' Company and the Sheikh which should be purely commercial in character^ possibly on the general lines oi thS revised/4. revised draft concession which tiie Company had now submitted, with such modification of Article 12 and such minor amendments in other articles as might be thought necessary; (b) a subsidiary agreement between the A.P.O.G. and H.M.G* to cover matters of interest primarily to H.M.G. and th« Company, rather than to H.M.G. and the Sheikh, or to the Company and the Sheikh, and to deal essentially with x:&gt;olitical points. This agreement,, which should be binding not only on the Company, but on any assignee or transferee company,could be either an exchange of letters or a formal agreement, perhaps preferably the latter. The Company at the discussion on 14th December' had indicated their readiness to deal with' certain points of this character in an exchange of letters. Such an agreement could cover e.g. safeguards for aerodromes and seaplane bases, safeguards lor wireless and other communications, undertakings by the Company that they would pay due deference'to the advice of our political representatives and the views of the Sheikh, possibly (a point to be discussed later in connection with Article 12 of the revised draft Concession), exclusive Bri.tr.sh exploitation of any concession, the appointment of a British Chief Local Representative, etc. Apart fr#m the points covered by (a) and (b), closer examination of the problem/0 5 m problem had shown that the grant of any oil concession 'by the Sheikh, whether t# the A.P.O .C,, the I. P.O., or an American Company, would give rise to difficult political problems in connection with jurisdiction over the concessionnaire t s employees, the grant of protection by in cases in which local conditions made this necessary and the Sheikh for any reason failed t« afford it, and, probably, the appointment of a political Agent to represent H .M .G. and would make it necessary t# consider bringing into force certain articles of the Sheikh's Treaty of 1916 which were at present dormant. Such questions could best be dealt with in a third agreement or exchange of letters between the Sheikh and H.M.G-. Considerable difficulty might be anticipated in disposing of them: and if we were to take them up with the Sheikh and try to reach a general understanding with him on political points, it might be thought desirable to take the opportunity also to secure the air facilities in Qatar which the Sheikh had hitherto refused to give save in return for guarantees of protection which H.M.C j . were not prepared to undertake. Mr« Rendel said that, speaking personally, he was entirely in favour of a procedure such as had .. been descr ibed# Higher authority at the Foreign Office had not of course yet been consulted. But action on these lines would, he was confident, be consistent with th^eir general view/@&gt; 6. view as at present advised; which was that, so long as the interests of H.M.G. and of th© Sheikh were adequately safeguarded, nothing should be done which would tend to hamper the conclusion of an agreement between the Sheikh and the A.P.O.G, in the immed iate fut ure* Delay would inevitably increase the risk that the Standard Oil Company of California might actively interest themselves in obtaining the concessiono Were they once to enter the field, they could rely on the active support of the U.S. Government, and however strong the case on merits f#r any special conditions which H.M.G. might be anxious to secure in respect of British control, British exploitation, British local representation &amp;c., we should almost certainly find it much more difficult to have our way on such points when dealing with a wholly foreign company backed by the U ..i. Government than when dealing witk a company such as the Iraq Petroleum Company in which there was a substantial British element. The procedure proposed, with an important proviso which the Foreign Office had already r ecommended to the India Office, would make it possible for the A.P.O.G. t# pursue negotiations immediately with the Sheikh with a view to reaching agreement on commercial points, - such an agreement t#- contain no clauses of a political character such as provision for jurisdiction &amp;c. While those nego tiations/negotiations were in progress, we could separately discuss with the Company the points tote covered in the proposed Agreement 'between the Company and while the local political authorities, after consultation with H .M.G. and the Government of India, could press on with a settlement of the points in issue 'between H .M.G. and the Sheikh, The proviso to which he had referred, and which if accepted should fully safeguard the special interests of H.M.G., was that a clause should be inserted in any commercial agreement 'between the A.P.0• C. and the Sheikh to the effect that the Agreement could not come into force until the consent if H .M .G. had been obtained t« its provisions- Such a clause merely reaffirmed the Sheikas existing treaty obligations and ought not therefore t* cause difficulty with him. Vis-a-vis the Company it Y^ould emphasize the special position of H .M.G* in the matter. Mr.Rendel added that in his view it would be desirable that the conditions to be laid down in respect of British control and exploitation of any concession, in whatever form they might emerge as a result of discussion by higher authority, and if necessary of reference to the Cabinet, should be conditions which would apply not merely t* a British concessionaire but to any other Company, of whatever nationality, which might endeavour to secure a concession in Qatar.. We had not yet thought out in detail at what conditions it would be desirable to aim, theIHe thought was essent the main 1 the agreerr H.M.G. she communlcat the Compar very near in order t any suggee that the C had been to proceed the commer agreement Sheikh on pretences: that if an difficulty be experie getting th to agree t terras it ir^ortant stale means avoiding t impression pressure w brought to upon him i interests A.P.o.C.He thought that it was essential that the main lines of the agreement with H.M.G. should be communicated, to the Company in the very near future, in order to avoid any suggestion that the Company had been allowed to proceed with the commercial agreement with the SheiWi on false pretences: also that if any difficulty were to be experienced in getting the Sheikh to agree to our terms it would be irnortant to devise Scale means of avoiding the impression that pressure was being brought to bear upon him in the interests of the A.P.o.C. questions involved were difficult and would need careful consideration, and it might therefore be impossible at once to inform the A.P.O.C. what precisely the conditions would be. But so long as their general outline could be communicated to the Company without delay, and the Company given to understand that whatever detailed conditions were finally laid down would be of universal application, it ought considerably to reduce their difficulties in negotiating either with the Sheikh or with the I.P.C. Mr. Seal said that, so far as he could judge, the Admiralty on the understandings stated by Mr.Rendel, were unlikely to object to the procedure suggested Mr. Laithwaite said that the India Office fully agreed with the proviso to which Mr. Rendel had referred, to which they attached great importance. As regards the conditions to be laid down, he thought that it would be well to give the Company a fairly clear idea of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which His Majesty's Government would be likely to require when we informed them next week of our comments on the revised draft agreement generally. It was obviously essential that they should have this information before they concluded any agreement with the Sheikh, even if such an agreement covered commercial points only and contained the proviso which had been discussed. It would not be overlooked that the A.P.O.C. could not conclude any agreement with the Sheikh without the approval of the I.P.C,/9. I.P»C« anci it might well be that safeguards such as we had in view might be ol' great importance from the I.P.O. standpoint. Mr»Starling said that w© must take care that the minimum safeguards etc# which ¥;e might prescribe, should not be such as to be impossible for the A.P.O.C., acting as they would be on behalf of the I.P.O. ,to accept. We must not overlook that, whatever the justification for them, if the conditions laid down by H .M .G. were to® stiff, the I.P.O. might be unwilling to take up, or to proceed with negotiations f«r, a concession, and if they were themselves unwilling to take it up it was open to them to insist that no one of their component groups, such as the A.P.O.C., should take it up independently. If that ha ppened we might find ourselves confronted immediately with the Standard Oil of California. He drew attention to the general principles whi®h had been laid downly the Cabinet to govern the grant of oil concessions in British territory and the conditions to be satisfied in the case of such concessions. The most important of these were: (1) Registration in British territory; (2) Majority of Employees and if possible Managing Director to be British subjects; (3) 50^ of produce to be refined on British territory, and the oil to be suitable f#r Admiralty use; (4) Pre-emption in time of war. Mr,Laithwaite pointed out that the decision in question had had in view British territory only. Qatar was not British territory,/10. tex^ritory, nor a British Protectorate# It was an independent Arab State in special treaty relations with H .M .G. The view that the Cabinet decision referred to did n^t cover the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, had consistently been held by the India Office in the inter-departmental discussions which had taken place in connection with the Koweit oil concession. Mr&gt;Rendel agreed and suggested that it had been accepted at the time of the assignment to American interests of the Bahrein oil concession that oil concessions to be granted in the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf must be dealt with separately and on their merits. It would be necessary to consider in the case of Qatar whether the conditions laid down by the Cabinet to apply in the case of concessions in British territory or more stringent conditions, and if so what, should apply. Mr.Starling, reverting to his previous remarks, enquired whether, if we so stiffened up our conditions that the I-P.C. dropped out, we should be prepared to impose the same conditions on an American Company, e.g. the Standard Oil Company of California- Mr.Laithwaite said that he thought our general view was that such conditions as may/(J l/ 11. may be laid down should apply to any Company, whether British or foreign. The two important points were control and exploitation; and it would have to 'be decided what our minimum requirements in respect of them were to 'be. If H.M.G. decided to lay down the principle that 'both control and exploitation must 'be British, whatever might 'be the nationality of the Company ultimately controlling the concession, and we could secure acceptance of these terms from any concessionaire, so much the 'better. If it proved impossible in practice to go so far, and to secure effective British control, then we ought as a minimum to require that local representation and exploitation should he in British hands. We could make a good case for this on the ground of the special local political difficulties of Qatar, where we should be dealing with a State with ill-defined 'boundaries, a 'backward and scattered population, hitherto little in touch with the outside world, and not easily susceptible te&gt; pressure by The Sheikh was precluded 'by his treaty engagements from dealings with foreign powers - engagements to which it was regarded as desirable to hold hinu If foreign subjects were massacred in Qatar by a tribal uprising or the like, responsibility for securing effective punishment would thus fall on H.M.G., and here as in dealing with air procedure we might reasonably take the line that while we wei e prepared/12* prepared./to face certain political difiiculties where our own nationals were concerned, we were not prepared to in the case of foreigners. On the face ■ of Ipy too, we had a good ansv/er to any American complaint that such conditions represented a refusal to maintain an open door policy in oil matters in the Gulf* The Trucial Coast was closed to all concession hunters, whether British or foreign- The Bahrein oil concession had already 'been reassigned, with our approval, t« American interests; and the latest information was that in Koweit f in which American interests had 'been allowed full liberty to compete, we should in future 'be dealing with an Angle- American combine. Our excuse for restricting exploitation in Qatar to British personnel would 'be the special political difficulties presented 'by that area. Mr,Starling said that it was relevant, so far as the nationality •f exploiting personnel was concerned, that Ibn Saudhad agreed that the concession granted in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California should be operated by American personnel, Mr,Reno.el said that the question of nationality of the exploiting personnel and of the safeguards would clearly have to be considered separately, but from the Foreign Office standpoint it would be 'easier to impose terms in respect of these on the 3.P.O. than on a purely Americai Company, such as the Standard Oil Company. Mr-Seal/13. Mr.Seal said that the question of safeguards for pre-emption would probably 'be regarded as more important from the Admiralty standpoint if the Qatar concession were to go to a U.S. Company than if it went to the I.P.O. The fact to be faced was that the Admiralty must have the oil in War, and if the Company were American certain diplomatic difficulties might arise which would be Tery much more easily handled if the agreement provided for preemption. Mr.Laithwaite said that the A.P.O.C# had been warned in the meeting on 14th December that in the event of their failing to secure the concession, or of competing interests entering the field, H.M.G. must not be regarded as permanently committed to approval of whatever terms they might in present conditions think suitable in the case of the A*3?.CuC. We could if necessary endeavour to make special provision in such circumstances for pre-emption. Mr.Rendel regarded it as of great importance that any conditions made by H.M.G. regarding safeguards, British control^ pre-emption etc., should be of universal application. He thought that if we demanded certain conditions from the A.P.O.C. or I.P.C., but demanded different or stiffer conditions from a purely U.S. Company, our international position would be much more difficult, since the U.S.Government would certainly accuse us of differentiation. If, on the other hand, we could work out conditions which would be applicable universally - quite irrespective of the nationality of the concessionary Company - and could be defended on merits in view of the political situation, our hands would be much strengthened in dealing with possible eventual representations of the U.S. or any other foreign Government. Mr.// ub 13 A. Mr.Laithy/aite expressed agreement as regards tiie importance of making our conditions universally applicable. He asked what importance was attached to a special safeguard for refining locally? Mr♦Hendel said he had the impression that the A.P.O.C. would object to being required to refine in Qatar* Mr«Starling suggested that they might be asked to agree to refine in Qatar or in British territory, and this was agreed. After further discussion it was agreed, subject to the approval of higher authority, (a) to accept in principle the procedure suggested at the opening of the meeting; (b) that a, letter (to be concurred in by the Departments concerned) should be sent by the India Office to Mr.Hearn in the course of next week, suggesting in the first place the adoption of the procedure which had been discussed as between the Sheikh and the Company/@) ^ 14. Company, and the Company and H.M.G.; secondly, recording the points on which agreement had 'been reached or which had been raised 'but not disposed of in the discussions with Mr.Praser and Mr.Hearn on 14th December; thirdly, indicating in general terms the nature of the points (including safeguards &amp;c») which H.M.G. would desire to see covered in the proposed subsidiary agreement between the Company and themselves. It would be desirable, in dealing with this last point, not to intimate a decision to the Company. The points in question were controversial and - the risk apart of. deterring the A.p.O.C, from proceeding with negotiations if they were t u- ■ stated in too categorical terms at this stage - it might be some time before H.M.G. Jiad themselves reached decisions on them. It would probably therefore be preferable to indicate them in outline and say that a more detailed statement would follow;that we should be prepared to discuss them further with the Company if necessary later^ but that in the interest of clearing the ground for their commercial negotiations with the Sheikh, we thought it undesirable to postpone communication of our comment on the draft agreement and on the question of procedure until the special desiderata of H.M.G. had been more fully elaborated. B. Amendments in Revised Draft Concession. The meeting then considered and approved the amendments which had been provisionally/@) u 15. provisionally agreed or raised on Mth December with Mr.Praser and Mr.Hearn in the articles of the revised draft other than Article 12; and reached agreement as to the supplementary points to be raised with the A.P.O.C. on the articles in question. (These are set out in the enclosure to the draft letter to the Company attached). Subject to their acceptance and to a satisfactory solution of the problems raised by Article 12, the meeting agreed that the revised draft concession which had been submitted by the A.P.O.C. was generally suitable. Z'N.B. It may be recorded that a point raised for the first time in connection with the draft Agreement which gave rise to considerable discussion was that of the definition of the Sheikh's dominions in Article 2 (c). The Southern and Western frontier of Qatar is at present somewhat indeterminate. At the same time it is important that there should be no risk of Ibn Saud being given an opportunity to call in question the line established by the Anglo Turkish Convention of 1913, i.e. a line running from the coast just east of Uqair due South to parallel 20 North. If a map is attached to, or a definition included in, the concession, it will be necessary either to include or to omit from Qatar the territory between the various southern frontiers of Qatar as described in and the 1913 Anglo Turkish line, and this would inevitably load to friction and controversy, particularly in view of the fact that the Standard15a, Standard Oil Company of California are now operating on the Hasa Coast. It was agreed therefore that it would be better to omit the map from the concession and to leave the definition as vague as possible, at any rate pending a further report on the whole question from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The position would be frankly explained to the A.P.O.C. C. Article IP, and connected questions . The meeting then turned to consider Article 2 and the questions -arising out of it. It was agreed that these were: (a) British control; (b) Position and nationality of Chief Local Representative; (c) Nationality of exploiting personnel; (d) Pre-emption and refining arrangements. The discussion on points (b), (c) &amp; (d) may be briefly summarised as follows (b) Position and nationality of Chief Local representative . It was very important, particularly so long as there was no resident Political Officer, that he should (as in Bahrein) be a British subject whose appointment should be approved by H.M.G., and that he should be persona grata to H.M.G. It would be desirable also that if and when a Political Agent was^ippointed, transactions between the Company and the Sheikh should/16. should 'be dealt with through the Political Agent. The Company had suggested that it might 'be easier to secure our desiderata under this head if we expressed them as a wish rather than a demand. But the p#int seemed too important to leave open in this way* (c) Nationality of employees» The case on merits for requiring that, whatever the ultimate control and nationality of any Company operating an oil concession in Qatar, local exploitation (and representation) should in present conditions 'be wholly British, had already been developed in the discussions above on procedure. It was agreed that a ruling would have to be sought on the difficult points it raised, pending which we could not commit ourselves to it as a sine qua non in writing to the Company: but that our letter should refer in general terms to the probability of such a requirement. (d) Pre-emption and Local Refining. It was agreed that an understanding as to the right of pre-emption in time of war was desirable and that this should be indicated to the Company- As regards refining they should be informed that it was regarded as important that oil won should be refined either in Qatar or in British territory and that they should be asked for an assurance on this. (The possibility of Karachi was mentioned. (a)/17. (a) British Control . The meeting considerea tne tentative redraft of Article 12 which had been put forward by Mr.Hearn at the meeting on 14th December. The effect was to secure that any company to which the conce ss ion might be transferred would be a British Company, registered in Great Britain, having its principal place of business in Great Britain, ana with a British subject at all times as Chairman, but to give any such company the right to form subsidiaries under its awn control to work the concession which, while enjoying the rights and accepting tne obligations of the parent company under the Agreement, would be under no restriction as regards nationality or British co'ntrol. It was agreed that the first paragraph of the redraft was unobjectionable so as it went. The second paragraph was unobjectionable if the words 'except the engagements expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause' were omitted. There would be no objection, if the Company tnought this woula facilitate negotiations with the Sheikh, to leaving the question of Britisn control out of the coianercial agreements to be negotiated between them and the sheikh altogether, so long as it was agreed with the A.P.O .C. that provisions to govern it satisfactory to/I *d) y; 18. to H .M .G. would fee included in the separate agreement to be negotiated between H.M.G. and the Company. It was generally felt, and Mr.Starling in particular emphasised that the A.P.O.C., negotiating as they must as agents of the I.P.C., might find considerable difficulty in accepting in respect of subsidiary companies British control provisions such as were embodied in Mr. Ream's redraft of sU d -paragraph 1 of Article 12 in respect of a transferee company. In this connection Mr. starling considered that there was no probability of persuading the A.P.O.G. to agree that the British control element in any assignee or subsidiary company should be as large as possible, and in no circumstances less than that in the I.P.C., and it was decided not to pursue this suggestion. Mi * atar lirm said tiiau the points of real importance to us were he thought O) local exploitation by British personnel, the right of pre-emption in time of war, &lt;! and the refining of any oil won either in Qatar or in British territory. The representatives of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office suggested, after further discussion, that even if we could persuade the a. P .o. C. and the i. P.O. to agree that any subsidiary company should be registered and nave its principal place of business in Great Britain, and a British Chairman, the control/(3) 19. control which this would secure to us might not in practice prove very suhstential, and that as our essential desiderata were those which had deen mentioned by Mr. starling, it might de that in the long run we should find it simplest to agree with the Company not to press the British control clause on the understanding that they would meet us fully as regards our other desiderata. Mr. ftendel pointed out in particular that if we coula secure our main desiderata dy other means, it might well be had tactics to insist on the strict application of the British control provisions to subsidiary companies - since this might only further complicate the already delicate position of the A.P.O.C. on the Board of the I.P.O. - while it would probably de possible in practice to secure dy other means that subsidiary companies were under the adequate control of their parent companies. Questions connected with the registration ana nationality of subsidiaries were often based on technical and financial considerations regarding taxation etc. and it did not follow that the non- application of the British control provisions to subsidiaries would in fact mean that those subsidiaries would escape from British control. It was finally agreed that in the letter to be sent to the Company our desiderata should be indicated in general terms and that a door should be left open for the Company to come back, on the ground that it would be unfortunate if, on hearing what our desiderata were, they decided that it would be useless to proceed with their negotiations, secondly that while the terms to be used would require careful consideration we might hint that n .Ivi .G, as at present aavised would require British control clauses/20. clauses In respect of subsidiary companies of the nature eiTibodied in sut)-cla,use 1 of Mr. Hearn's tentative redraft of Article 12, together with an understanding as to British exploitation and the position of the Chief Local Representative, the right of preemption in time of war, and the refining of oil won either locally or in British territory. If as the result of further discussion we were to secure the Company's agreement to British exploitation and icpr?s^ntation ttnu ctn uncierstondxn^ c^s re^arcis preemptiicn refining might assume pressed. in time of war, the question of less importance ana need not heLin/ I -U 4- Lfo.

As you will see, we have told Ballantyne that In the circumstances we see no objection to further informal discussion of the difficulty at Bahrein and that we are are so informing you. The correspondence makes it clear what Is, in our view, the/ Hon'ble Lt.Col. T.C.W.

As Ballantyne will be writing direct to Skinner ahout this I am venturing to send a copy of this letter hy to-day's air mail to Loch. Copies are also being sent to the Government of India. Yours sincerely,A { h IHDIA OWICE, ¥i/HITEHALL, S.W.I. P.Z.8231/33. S7th December, 1933. Dear Ivlr. Ballantyno, x Many thanks for your letter of 21st December about the payment of import duties at Bahrein. The language of the clause in dispute must, of course, as a matter of strict legal interpretation, be interpreted as it stands and, as I explained in our discussion on the 4th December, the correct interpretation in our view is that the terms 'material, apparatus and machinery 11 cover technical equipment required by the Company for the purposes of its field work; the term 'office requirements' covers secretarial material, such as typewriters, office tables and desks, etc., required for the equipping of their secretarial offices. On the other hand the phrase 'not including the personal requirements of employees' shows that personal equipment for employees, such as beds, mirrors and household furniture generally, would be liable to pay such duty as/ ^ ® al l a ntyne, Esq., Bahrein Petroleum Co, Ltd., J-S, Moorgate, E.G.2.3./ as was in force from time to time, and was therefore specifically excluded from the exemption granted to 'office requirements' and 'material, apparatus and machinery'. We cannot in any circumstances agree that articles such as food and gramophone records fall within the scope of the exemption. 2. The matter is a small one, and, as you say, it would 'be unfortunate if it were to deTelop into a question of importance or a source of friction between the Company and the local authorities and the Bahrein Government. In our view, save possibly on the question of motor cars, the State are justified in the interpretation they place on the clause in dispute and, particularly having regard to the small amount involved, we think the Company might well yield the point. But if they do not feel disposed to do so, we have no objection to further informal discussion locally^ though, as I explained at our meeting on 4th December, we must of course make it clear to the State that the correct interpretation of the clause is in our view that set out in paragraph 1 above.3. 3. Our attitude on the question of motor cars is y as set out in paragraph 2 of my letter, No »F,Z.7187/33, of 23rd N otember. It was agreed, I think, in the course of our discussion that a car imported by an employee for private use as distinct from one imported by the Company for the official purposes of its work would, of course, be liable to duty. J. Q, LAlTHWAlTErP.2&gt; 8555/35. THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COM PAH Y LIMITED, 19, MOORGATE, LOmOE, E.G. 2. 28th December, 1953. Dear Mr.Laithwaite , Import Duties, Bahrein. ' I have to thank you for your letter (P.Z.8231/33) of the 27th December. The Company appreciates the standpoint of the, first paragraph of your letter but it does not feel, legally speaking, that your construction is altogether correct. If the matter rested upon the amount of money involved at the present time, I think the Canpany would not hesitate for one second to yield the point but there is a question of pHincxpla introlvad, the Company feeling that its view of the meaning of the clause we are discussing, is a fair one; therefore, the Company would feel obliged if you would kindly instruct the local Authorities to endeavour to settle the matter locally through the medium of a further informal s i ©n.

I have to thank you for your letter dated July 28th 1932 addressed to THE EASTERN &amp; GENERAL SYNDICATE LIHITED,LOUDON dealing with the Commission Agreement in your favour dated May 16th 1923,with an extension dated 3-3-27 and acknowledgment dated A-l-28 that the conditions had been fulfilled by Your Excellency. The Directors of THE EASTERN GENERAL SYNDICATE LIMITED have instructed me to deal with your letter. The Agreement provides that the Company has the option of paying in shares or in cash. The Company has decided to make payment to you in cash and has instructed me accordingly. The answers to your queries are as follows (1). THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED is a British Company tonned and registered under the laws of THE DOMINION OP CANADA and is the first Company formed to explore,prospect and to exploit THE BAHREIN OIL CONCESSION. The Share Capital of THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED is 500,000 (Five hundred thousand) Shares of One Dollar (Canadian) each. Up to the end of August 1932 the Directors of THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED had sanctioned the issue of 100,000 (One hundred thousand) Shares of One Dollar (Canadian) each. There remain, ^ith the Company 400,000 (Pour hundred thousand) Shares of One Dollar (Canadian) each,unissued. (2). The cash value of half of one percentum of the 100,000 /2.(% i Xl 2. (One hundred thousand) Shares already issued is 0.500/- (Five hundrea Dollars Canadian). At the present rate of exchange $.500/- (Five hundred dollars Canadian) is approximately £.125/- (One hundred and twenty-live pounds Sterling) or Es.l68V/- (One thousand six hundred and eighty seven rupees only). This payment of £.125/- (One hundred and twenty five pounds Sterling) will be made to you within 7 days of your applying to me for the money. It is impossible for me to say when and how the remaining 400,000 (Four hundred thousand) Shares will be issued. The issue of Shares depends on the cash requirements,from time to time,necessary to carry on the work of the development of THE BAHEEilN OIL CONCESSION. It is reasonably certain that issues will be made in blocks of shares,such issues being spread over a period ot several years. As and when each separate block is made from the 400,000 (Four hundred thousand) Shares,a payment in cash in proportion to the number of Shares issued will be made to you within 30 days of such issues being made.

(1) The meeting after discussion of the line to he taken in the light of the telegram No.606, dated 19th December 1933 from the Political Agent, Bahrein, (copies circulated under P.Z.8165/33) on the subject of the intentions of the Bahrein Petroleum Company as regards local refining, concurred in a draft of instructions to the Political O Resident (despatched as India Office telegram 3173, of 22nd December). (2) Mr.Laithwaite briefly explained the latest developments in connection with the request of the Bahrein Petroleum Company for the assistance of H.M.G. in surveying, buoying and lighting certain approaches to Bahrein in connection with the shipment of oil w«n by them. As the result of discussion at the Admiralty it had beoi thought better, in the interests of avoiding any excuse for the introduction - of U.S. naval personnel to conduct surveys, etc., and of keeping control of any lighting and buoying arrangements in British hands, to give the Company all possible assistance •n a repayment basis. It was now proposed, after discussion with the Company's representatives, to invite the Government of India, if they saw no objection, to undertake the necessary^work, on a x ^epayment basis so that full control for any 'buoys laid would be secured to Government. The Company had intimated that the Standard Oil Company of California had placed an expert party at their disposal who would arrive in London from the U.S.A. on 4th January en route for Bahrein to deal with the question of the laying of the proposed submarine pipeline and the connected questions of laying moorages and floats. The meeting took note of the position* II. Qatar Oil Concession. The meeting resumed consideration of the revised oil concession communicated informally by the A«P*O.Co on 11th X December 1933, in the light of the record of the discussion which had taken place with the representatives of the Company on 14th December, (P.Z.8212/33)# MroLaithwaite said that the A.P.O.C. were pressing for the earliest possible indication of any amendment that H.M .G. might desire, in the interests of facilitating Mr.Chisholm' s negotiations in Qatar, and had been anxioisfor information before Christmas. That was impossible, but it seemed desirable to let them have a letter early next w&amp;ek* The meeting agreed. It was agreed that it would be best first to consider the general procedure to be adopted in negotiating with the Company and the Sheikh; secondly, the supplementary amendments, if any, to be suggested to the Company in Articles of the revised draft concession other than Article 12 thirdly. Article 12 and the connected questions of British control, exclusive British exploitation of any concession granted (though this point strictly arose on Article 1*7), and the maintenance of a British Chief Local Representative of the Company in Qatar. The India Office wished to suggest v ^ consideration/3. consideration in this connection of certain special restrictions, arising out of political conditions in Qatar, which would apply to all Companies applying for concessions whatever their nationality. III. A* Procedure. On the question of procedure, Mr.Laithwaite said that as the A.P.O.C. were apparently willing to cover certain points of special interest to H.M.G. in an exchange of letters (which must of course he of a character binding on the Company and on any transferees or assignees), the simplest course, in the light of previous informal discussion with the Foreign Office, and subject to the views of the meeting, appeared to 'b e that there should be: (a) an agreement between the Company and the Sheikh which should be purely commercial in character, possibly on the general lines of the revised draft concession which the Company had now submitted, with such modification of Article 12 and such minor amendments in other articles as might be thought necessary; (b) a subsidiary agreement between the A.P.O.C. and H.M.G. to cover matters of interest primarily to H.M.G. and the Company, rather than to H.M.G. and the Sheikh, or to the Company and the Sheikh, and to deal essentially with political points. This agreement, which should toe toinding not only on the Company, tout on any assignee or transferee company, could toe either an exchange of letters or a formal agreement, perhaps preferatoly the latter. The Company at the discussion on 14th Decemtoer had indicated their readiness to deal with certain points of this character in an exchange of letters. buch an agreement could cover, e.g. safeguards for aerodromes ^ seaplane bases, safeguards for wireless and other *1 communications, undertakings by the Company that they woii pay/(?) ^ 4# pay due deference to the advice of our political representatives and the views of the Sheikh, possibly (a point to be discussed later in connection with Article 12 of the revised draft Concession)&gt; exclusive British exploitation of any concession, the appointment of a British Chief Local Representative, etc. Apart from the points covered by (a) and (b), closer examination of the problem had shown that the grant of any oil concession by the Sheikh, whether to the A .P .O.C., the I.P .C., or an American Company, would give rise to difficult political problems in connection with jurisdiction over the concessionnaire 1 s employees, the grant of protection by H.M.G. in cas®s in which local conditions made this necessary and the Sheikh for any reason failed to afford it, and, probably, the appointment of a Political Agent to represent H.M.G- and would make it necessary to consider bringing into force certain articles of the Sheikh's Treaty of 1916 which were at present dormant. Such questions could best be dealt with in a third agreement or exchange of letters between the Sheikh and IT.MUG. Considerable difficulty might be anticipated in disposing of them: and if we were to take them up with the Sheikh- and try to r»ach a general understanding with him on political points, it might be thought desirable to take the opportunity also to secure the air facilities in Qatar which the Sheikh had hitherto refused to give save in return for* guarantees of protection which H.M.G. were not prepared to undertake. Mr.Rendel said that, speaking personally, he was entirely in favour of a procedure such as had been described. Higher authority at the Foreign Office had not of course yet been consulted. But action on these lines would, he was confident, be consistent with their ger^eral view/5, viei/y as at present advised: which was that, so long as the interests of H.M.G. and of the Sheikh were adequately safeguax^ded nothing should be done which would tend to hamper the conclusion of an agreement between the Sheikh and the A.P/O.C. in the immediate future. Delay would inevitably increase the risk that the Standard -Oil Company of California might actively interest themselves in obtaining the concession. Were they once to enter the field, they could rely on the active support of the U.S. Government, and however strong the case on merits for any special conditions which H.M.G. might be anxious to secure in respect of British control, British exploitation, British local representation &amp;c., we should almost certainly find it much more difficult to have our way on such points when dealing with a wholly foreign company backed by the U.S. Government than when dealing with a company such as the Iraq. Petroleum Company in which there was a substantial British element. The procedure proposed, with an important proviso which the Foreign Office had already recommended to the India Office, would make it possible for the A.P.O.C. to pursue negotiations immediately with the Sheikh with a view to reaching agreement on commercial points, - such an agreement to contain no clauses of a political character such as provision for jurisdiction &amp;c. While those negotiations were in progress, we could separately discuss with the Company the points to be covered in the proposed Agreement between the Company and H.M.G. : while the local political authorities, after consultation with H.M.G. and the Government of India, could press on with a settlement of the points in issue between H .M .G. and the Sheikh. The proviso to which he had referred, and which if accepted should fully safeguard the special interests of H .M.G. , was that a clause should be inserted in any commercial agreement between the A.P,04c. and the Sheikh to the effect that' the Agreement could not/I I r(s) 6. not come into force until the consent of H.M.G. had 'been obtained to its provisions. Such a clause merely reaffirmsd the SiieiMi 1 s existing treaty obligations and ought not therefore to cause difficulty with him. Vis-a-vis the Company it would emphasise the special position of h.m .G. in the matter. Mr. He ridel added that in his view it would 'be desirable that the conditions to he laid down in respect of British control and exploitation of any concession, in whatever fox^m they might emerge as a result of discussion 'by higher authority, and if necessary of reference to the Caoinet, should 'be conditions which would apply not merely to a British concessionaire but to any other Company, of whatever nationality, which might endeavour to secure a concession in Qatar, We had not yet thought out in detail at what conditions it would be desirable to aim, the questions involved were difficult and would need careful consideration, and it might therefore be impossible at once to inform the A.P.C.G. what precisely the conditions would be* But so long as their general outline could be communicated to the Company without delay, and the Company given to understand that whatever detailed conditions were finally laid down would be of universal application, it ought considerably to reduce their difficulties in negotiating either with the Sheikh or with the I.P.O. Mr e Seal said that, so far as he could judge, the Admiralty on the understandings stated by Mr. Rendel, were unlikely to object to the procedure suggested. He thought that it was essential that the main lines of the agreement with should be canmunicated to the Company in the. ve 4 ry near future, in order to avoid any suggestion that the Company.had been allowed to proceed with the commercial agreement with the Sheikh on false pretences: also that if any difficulty were to be experienced/@) o experienced in getting the SheiMi to agree to oar terms it would 'be important to devise some means of avoiding the impression that pressure was being brought to bear upon him in ^ the interests of the A.P.O.C, Mr* Laith?iaite said that the India Office fully agreed with the proviso to which Mr. Rendel had referred, to which they attached great importance. As regards the conditions to be laid down, he thought that it would be well to give trie Company a fairly clear idea of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which His Majesty 1 s Government would be likely to require when we informed them next week of our comments on the revised draft agreement' generally. It was obviously essential that they should have this information before they concluded any agreement with the Sheikh, even if such an agreement covered commercial points only and contained the proviso which had been discussed. It would not be overlooked that the A.P.0.0. could not conclude any agreement with the Sheikh without the approval of the I.P.O. and that it might well be that safeguards such as we had in view might be of great importance from-the I.P.O. standpoint. Mr. Starling said that we must take care that the minimum safeguards etc. which we might prescribe, should not be such as to be impossible for the A.P.0.0. acting as they would be on behalf of the, I.P.O. to accept. We must not overlook that, whatever the justification for theip, if the conditions laid down by were too stiff, the I.P.O. might be unwilling to take up, or to proceed with negotiations for, a concession, and if they were themselves unwilling to take it up a position might arise where the A.P.O.O. could not take it up independently. If that happened we might find ourselves confronted immediately with the Standard Oil of California• He drew attention to the general principles which had been laid down by the Cabinet to govern/8. govern the grant of oil concessions in British territory and the conditions to be satisfied in the case of such concessions. The most important of these vjere: (l) Registration in British territory; (£.) Majority of Employees and if possible Managing Director to oe British sotgects; (3) 50 c /o of produce to be refined on British territory, and the oil to be suitable for Admiralty use 9 (4) Pre-emption in time of war, Mr. Laith^aite pointed out that the decision in question had had in vievii British territory only. Qatar was not British territory, nor a British Protectorate. It was an independent Arab State in special treaty relations with H.M.G. The view that the Cabinet decision referred to did not coirer the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, had consistently been held by the India Office in the inter departmental discussions which had taken place in connection with the Koweit oil concession. Mr. Re ride 1 agreed and suggested that it had been accepted at the time of the assignment to American interests of the Bahrein oil concession that oil concessions to be granted in the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf must be dealt with separately and on their merits. It would be necessary to consider in the case of Qatar whether the conditions laid down by the Cabinet to apply in the case of concessions in British territory or more stringent conditions, and if so what;, should apply. Mr. Starling/(S&gt; 9. Mr&gt;Starling , reverting to his previous remarks, enquired whether, if we so stiffened up our conditions that the I.P.C. dropped out, we should feel quite sure that we could impose the same conditions on an American Company, e.g. the Standard Oil Ccmpany of California. Mr .Laithwaite said that he thought our general view was that such conditions as may 'be laid down should apply to any Gcmpany, whether British or foreign. The two important points were control and exploitation; and it would have to be decided what our minimum requirements in respect of them were to 'be. If H .M .G. decided to lay down the principle that both control and exploitation must be British, whatever might be the nationality of the Company ultimately controlling the concession, and we could secure acceptance of these terms from any concessionaire, so much the better. If it proved impossible in practice to go so far, and to secure effective British control , then we ought as a minimum to require that local representation and exploitation should be in British hands. We could make a good case for this on the ground of the special local political difficulties of Qatar, where we should be dealing with a State with ill-defined boundaries, a backward and scattered population, hitherto little in touch with the outside world , and not easily susceptible to pressure by H .M .G. The Sheikh was precluded by his treaty engagements from dealings with foreign powers - engagements to which it was regarded as desirable to hold him. If foreign subjects were massacred in Qatar by a tribal uprising or the like, responsibility for securing effective punishment would thus fall on H .M .G. , and here as in dealing with air procedure we might reasonably take the line that while we were prepared to face certain political/xo. political difficulties where our own nationals were concerned, we were not prepared to in the case of foreigners. Cn the face of it, too, we had a good answer to any American complaint that such conditions represented a refusal to maintain an open door policy in oil matters in the Gulf. The Trucial Coast was closed to all concession hunters, whether British or foreign. The Bahrein oil concession had already been reassigned, with our approval, to American interests; and the latest information was that in Koweit, in which .American interests had been allowed full liberty to compete, we should in future be dealing with an Anglo-American combine* Our excuse for restricting exploitation in Qatar to British personnel would be the special political difficulties presented by that area. Mr.Starling said that it was relevant, so far as the nationality of exploiting personnel was concerned, that Ibn Saud had agreed that the concession granted in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California should be operated by American personnel. Mr.Rendel said that the question of nationality of the exploiting personnel and of the safeguards would clearly have to be considered separately, but from the Foreign Office standpoint it would be easier to impose terms in respect of these on the I.P.C. than on a purely American Company, such as the Standard Oil Company. Mr.Seal said that the question of safeguards for pre-emption would probably be regarded as more important from the Admiralty standpoint if the Qatar concession were to go to a IKS.Company than if it went to the I.P.C. The fact to be faced was that the Admiralty must have the oil in War, and if the Company were American certain diplcmatic difficulties might arise which would be very much/0) «? ii7 much more easily handled if the agreement provided for preemption. Mr.Laithwait^ said that the AiP.O.C. had been warned in the meeting on 14th Deceirrber that in the event of their failing tb secure the coneessi on, or of competing interests entering the field, H.M.G* must not be regarded as permanently committed to approval of whatever terms they might in present conditions think suitable in the case of the A.P.O.C. We could if necessary endeavour to make special provision in such circumstances for pre-emption. Mr.Rendel regarded it as of great importance that any conditions made by H.M.G. regarding safeguards, British control, pre-emption etc., should be of universal application. He thought that if we demanded certain conditions from the A.P.O.C. or I.P.C. , but demanded different or stiffer conditions fran a purely U*S. Company, our international position would be much more difficult, since the U.S.Government would certainly accuse us of differentiation. If, on the other hand, we could work out conditions which would be applicable universally - quite irrespective of the nationality of the concessionary Company - and could be defended on merits in view of the political situation, our hands would be much strengthened in dealing with possible eventual representations of the U.S. or any other foreign Government. Mr.Laithwaite expressed agreement as regards the importance of making our conditions universally applicable. He asked what importance was attached to a special safeguard for refining locally ? Mr.Rendel said he had the impression that the A.P.0.0 .would object to being required to refine in Q^atar. Mr. Starling suggested that they might be asked to agree to refine in Qatar or in British territory, and this was agreed. After further discussion it was agreed,subject to the approval of higher authority, (a) to accept in principle the procedure suggested at the opening of the meeting; (b) that a letter (to be concurred in by the Departments concerned)12. concerned) should be sent 'by the India Office to Mr.Hearn in the course of next week, suggesting in the first place the adoption of the procedure which had been discussed as between the Sheikh and the Company, and the Company and secondly, recording the points on which -agreement had been reached or which had been raised but not disposed of in the discussions with Mr.Fraser and Mr.Hearn on 14th December; thirdly, indicating in general tex^ms the nature of the points (including safeguards &amp;c. ) which H.M.G. would desire to see covered in the proposed subsidiary agreement between the Company and themselves. It would be desirable, in dealing with this last point, not to intimate a decisi on to the Caiipany. The points in question were controversial and - the risk apart of deterring the A.P.O.C. from proceeding with negotiations if they were stated in too categorical terms at this stage - it might be some time before H.M.G. had themselves reached decisions on them. It would probably therefore be preferable to indicate them in outline and say that a more detailed statement would follow; that we should be prepared to discuss them further with the Canpany if necessary later, but that in the interest of clearing the ground for their commercial negotiations with the Sheikh, we thought it undesirable to postpone ccmmunication of our comment on the draft agreement and on the question of procedure until the special desiderata of H.M.G. had been more fully elaborated. E. . Amendments in Revised Draft Concession. The meeting then considered and approved the amendments which had been provisionally agreed or raised on 14th December with Mr.Fraser and Mr.Hearn in the articles of the revised draft other than Article 12 ; and reached agreement as to the supplementary points to be raised with the A.P.O.C. on the articles in question. (These are set out in the enclosure to the draft letter to/0./ 13. to the Uompany attaohed). Subject to thoir acceptance and to a satisfactory solution of the problems raised hy Article 12, the meeting agreed that the revised draft P concession which had been submitted by the A,P.0.G. was t/ generally suitable, /N.3. It may be recorded that a point raised for the first time in connection with the draft Agreement which rave rise to considerable discussion was that of the definition of the Sheikh's dominions in Article 2 (c). The Southern and Western frontier of Qatar^is at present somewhat indeterminate. At the same time it is important that there should be. no risk of Ibn Saud being given an opportunity to call in question the line established by the unratified Anglo Turkish Convention of 29th July, 1913, i.ea line running from the coast just oast of Uqair due South to parallel 20 North, on the Eastern boundary of Ncjd. If a map is attached to, or a definition included in, the concession, it will be necessary either to include in or to omit from Qatar as shown on the map or in the definition the territory between the various frontiers of ^atar as described in the Political Bfesident r s Despatch -—-No, 41 of 24th June, 1933, to the Colonial Office, (P.Z,4642/33) and the 1913 Anglo Turkish line, and this would inevitably lead to friction and controversy, particularly in view of the fact that the Standard Oil Company of California are now operating on the Hasa Coast. It was agreed therefore that it would be better to omit the map from'the concession and to leave the definition as vague as possible, at any rate pending the further report on the whole question which is awaited from the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf- The position,could be frankly explained to the A.P^O.C*/i S— I to I e' 14. c - Article 12 and cn rmected Question,q . The meeting then turned to consider Article 12 and the questions arising out of it. it was agreed that these were: (a) British control; (b) Position and nationality of Chief Local ite pre sentative; (c) Nationality of exploiting personnel; (d) Pre-emption and refining arrangements. The aiscussion on points (b), (c) and (d) may be briefly sumniarised as followsj- ^ D ^ anu nationality of Chief jjoca l riepresentative . ' It was vc^y iniportant, particularly so long as there was no resident Political Officer, that he should (as in Bahrein) he a British subject whose appointment should be approved by H.M.G.,aid that he should be persona grata to H.M.G. It would be desirable also that if and vstoen a Political Agent was appointed, transactions between the Company and tne .Sheikh should be dealt with through the Political Agent. The Company haa suggested that It might 08 easi8r to secure our desiderata under this head if we expressed tnem as a wish rather than a demand. But the point seemed too important to leave open in this way. ( c ) Nationality of employees . Ihe case on merits for requiring that, whatever the ultimate control and nationality of any Company operating an oil concession in Qatar, local exploitation (and representation) shoula in present conditions be wholly British, had already been developed in the discussions above on procedure. It was agreed that a ruling would have to be sought on the difficult points it raised, pending which we could not commit ourselves to it as a in writing to the Company: but that our letter should refer in general terms to the probability of such a requirement. (d)/15. (d) Pre-eniptlon ana Local defining . It was agreed that an understanding as to the right of pre-emption in time of war was desirable and that this shoula he indicated to the Company. As regards refining they shoula be informed that it was regarded as important that oil won shoula be refined either in ^atar or in British territory ana that they should be asked for em assurance on this. Ihe possibility of Karachi was mentioned. (a) British Con tiro 1 . Ihe meeting consiaerea the tentative redraft of Article 12 which had been put forward by Mr. Hearn at the meeting on 14th December. Ihe effect was to secure that any company to which the concession might be transferred woula be a British Company, registerea- in Great Britain, having its principal place of business in Great Britain, and with a British subject at all times as Chairman, but to give any such company the right to form subsidiaries under its own control to work the concession which, while enjoying the rights and accepting the obligations of the parent company under the Agreement, would be under no restriction as regards nationality or British control. It was agreed that the first paragraph of the rearaft was unobjectionable so far as it went. The second paragraph was unobjectionable if the words 'except the engagements expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause' were omitted. There would be no objection, if the Company thought this would facilitate negotiations with the sheikh, to leaving the question of British control out of the commercial agreements to be negotiatea between them and the/16. ciie Sheikn altogether, so long as it was agreed, with the A.P.O.G. that provisions to govern it satisfactory to K.M.G. would he included in the separate agreement to be negotiated between H.M.G. and the Company. It was generally felt, and wr. starling in particular emphasised that the A.P-.O.G., negotiating as they must as agents of the I.P.O., might find considerable difficulty in accepting in respect of subsidiary companies British control provisions such as were embodied in kr. Hearn's redraft of sub-paragraph 1 of article 12 in respect of a transferee company, in this connection ter. starling considered that the British control element in any assignee or subsidiary company would not be less, and from what Mr, Fraser had said on 11th December there was a prospect that it might be considerably more than that in the I.p.G, He was averse j.rom asking, in uhese conditions for a formal guarantee that it should be as large as possible and in no circumstances less than that in the I.P.C., and it was decided not to pursue this suggestion. Mr. Starling said that the points of real importance to us were, he thought, local exploitation cy British personnel, the right of pre-emption in time of war, and the refining of any oil won either in Qatar or in British territory. The representatives Ox the Aamiralty ana the Foreign Office suggested, after furtner discussion, that even if we could persuade jim a . P . o . o . and tne I.p.G. to agree that any subsidiary company should be registered and have its principal place of business In Great Britain, and a British Chairman, the control/17 control which this would secure to us might not in practice prove very substantial, and that as our essential desiderata were those which had been mentioned by Mr. Starling, it might be that in the long run we should find it simplest to agree with the Company not to press the British control clause on the understanding that they would meet us fully as regards our other desiderata. Mr. Hendel pointed out in particular that if we could secure our main desiderata by other means, it might well be bad tactics to insist on the strict application of the British control provisions to subsidiary companies - since this might only further complicate the already delicate position of the A.P.O.C. on the Board of the I•P.O. - while it would probably be possible in practice to secure by other means that subsidiary companies were under the adequate control of their parent companies. Questions connected with the registration ana nationality of subsidiaries were often based on technical and financial considerations regarding taxation etc. and it did not follow that the non- application of the British control provisions to subsidiaries would in fact mean that those subsidiaries would escape from British control. It was finally agreed that in the letter to be sent to the Company our desiderata should be indicated in general terms and that a door should be left open for the Company to come back, on the ground that it would be unfortunate if, on hearing what our desiderata were, they decided that it would be useless to proceed with their negotiations, secondly that mile the terms to be used would require careful consideration we might hint that H.M.G. as at present advised would require British control clauses/•18. clauses in respect ot subsidiary companies of the nature embodied in sub-clause 1 of Mr. Hearn's tentative redraft of Article 12, togetner with an understanding as to British exploitation and the position of the Chief Local Representative, the right of preemption in time of war, .and the refining of oil won either locally or in British territory. If as the result of further discussion we were to secure the Company's agreement to British exploitation ana representation and an understanding as regards preemptto in time of war, the question of refining might assume less importance ana need not be pressed.

Note of an Interview with Mr. Ballantvne at the Inala CJtlce on Friday. 2ytn DecemMr, Consequent on Informal discussion with the interested departments in the light of the Naval Commander-in-Chief's telegram No. 920 of 23ra jDecember and of a telephone conversation with Mr. Ballantyne, I asked him to come to see rne to-day to discuss the situation which had arisen in connection with the despatch of a party of 45 ijnericans for the purpose of laying the suhmarine line. 2. I said on his arrival that, as I had already explained by telephone, had we known that so large a party of foreigners was contemplated and haa we thought that the expert party to which he had referred meant more than five or six people, we should certainly have pressed, under the guarantee given by the Company at the time of the assignment, that the work should be done by British personnel, such personnel were available and we had in fact made arrangements to put the expert who haa advised the A.?.0,C. in similar cases in touch with them. In all the circumstances, however, and as matters had advanced so far, we did not propose to interfere with the arrangements that had been made, out I was asked to emphasise that the sudden arrival of a large party of foreigners in a snail Arab state of this type might well be very embarr&amp;ssiiag; that it was most important that the Americans should pay due deference to any advice they might receive from the local political authorities and should walk extremely carefully; that the more of them who lived on board the ' SI segundo' the better. He would, not/2. not misunderstand it if one warned iilrn that in the event of troucle it would probably be necessary to request uhe removal of the offending party. Mr. Ballantyne interrupted to say that the Company had consistently been most anxious to work harmoniously in the Gulf and had taken special pains about the selection of personnel. He could assure me that any man of the party who misbehaved would be renoved long before any official protest could be made. I went on to say that this was possibly a delicate subject but that we felt we had reason to complain of a recent failure of liaison. Ihere seemed to be an increasing tendency for the Company to deal direct with Bahrein without keeping London fully inlormed. As Mr. Ballantyne was aware, four departments here were closely concerned with the working of this concession, and it was most important that we should be kept in touch direct with all developments in connection with it. In recent cases neither Mr. Ballantyne nor the India Office had had information of the Company's intentions. An embarrassing situation might arise unless liaison was improved. If he thought it desirable he was at full liberty to inform the Company that we had protested officially and were anxious that the situation should be improved. 4 ' Mr. Ballantyne said that as regards the expert submarine party the Company were not to be taken as accepting our proposition that they could have been/been required to employ British personnel, tut he would say quite frankly that he fully realised the possible difficulties and apprehensions which the arrival of a large party of foreigners for a period of two or three months might give rise to. He appreciated the iact that we did not wish to press our objection to the despatch of the party. We coula rely on every precaution being taken to ensure that no difficulties were caused locally and the points which I had mentioned to him would be fully borne in mind. 5. On the question of liaison, he end Mr .Hamilton entirely agreed that arrangements had been unsatisfactory lately. Tney had sent in a protest in very strong terms to the Company. Their position would, indeed, be made impossible unless they were kept in closer touch with what was going on. What had caused particular annoyance to them was that they haa not been informed at the time of tne Company's arrangements in connection with production and shipment (I understood this to be the arrangement for shipping 5,000 barrels a day by 1st July 1934, reported in the political Resident's telegram of 12th December, No. 1124, P.Z..8020/33). He tnought that as a result of the protest there would be no difficulty in future. Part of the trouble arose from the fact that the Engineering Department in California had been dealing with tnat certain of the technical aspects and/it had been necessary to hustle at the last moment, because it was regarded as important to get preparatory work such as the laying of the submarine line out of the way before the beginning of the hot weather. For part of the trouble also Mr. Skinner was responsible. He was a technician and not a representative and while his local relations appeared to be/4. 'oe excellent, he did not appear to realise on what points it was necessary to keep London in close touch with what was going on. That, too, he thought would he remedied in future. 6. Mr. Ballantyne proceeded that, apart from a lack of appreciation of what was and what was not important from the London point of view, Mr. Skinner was inclined to write abrupt and unsatisfactory letters. Thus, the Sheikh having recently written to make an enquiry as to the Company's intentions in regard to refining, Mr. Skinner had replied that the Company had no present intention of refining locally and that they were under no obligation so to do. That was not the type of letter to write. 7. I said that we had seen the letter ana that it had been regarded as unsatisfactory. We should be writing to him on the subject in the' immediate future. 8. Mr. Ballantyne saia that the fact was that it was far too early to talk of detailed refining arrangements. The Company had not yet worked out its marketing or sale arrangements, and the first thing to do was to find out how much oil there was likely to be and on what scale arrangements ought to be made and what difficulties there might be in connection with them. If the Sheikh of Bahrein merely wanted a small local refinery to supply his own needs and those of his population, there would probably be no difficulty about it. There was to be a capping plant at Bahrein. 9. I said that what the Sheikh wanted was that the oil won by the Company shoula be refined locally, thus providing employment for his subjects and bringing money, in the shape of wages, into Bahrein. It was not/5. not merely a question of local reQuirements. Mr. Ballantyne said that until natters proceeded further it was clearly Impossible for the Company to commit themselves as regards refining arrangements for the reasons which he had explained. I said that presumably it was in principle desirable to refine locally on commercial grounds, since local refining would save the cost and difficulty of transporting crude oil for considerable distances. Mr. Ballantyne agreed. He said that the nearest refineries of the Company (? The standard Oil) appeared to be in fexico and the Caribbean sea. I said that was half-way round the world. He enquired whether the A .P .O .C. refined locally in the Gulf. I said 'Yes, at ilbadan 1 . This appeared to strike him and he asked if we could get a copy of the a.P.O.C . concession, which he unaerstood was a public document, since it might be of considerabt assistance to the Company in formulating their further plans. I promised to do this. 10. In conclusion, I said tnat I thought it would be a good thing if we had a talk with Mr. Deacon, the leader of the submarine line party, before he went out ana further impressed on him the considerations to which Mr. Ballantyne's attention had been drawn. Mr...Ballantyne agreed.. He added that the suggestion haa been made that he shoula himself go out to Bahrein with the party to see local conditions and he thought that he would now ao this. He would probably be away from London not more than three weeks in all. It would be possible to say a good deal orally to Mr.Skinner which he coulo not write, and such a visit would, he thought make it still more unlikely than before that there would be any repetition of the lack of liaison and of/6. )i the danger of embarrassing incidents such as that &gt;hich nad arisen in connect ion with the despatch of he survey party. 9th December 1933. J.G. LAITHWAIT' ©)flONFIDSNIIAL. INDIA OFFICE . P.Z.171/34. NOTE OP DISCUSSION AI Tffii ADMxiALTY ON 8tb JAMJA3Y 1934 WITH RSPHSSiSNTATIVS3 OP THE SAKrEIN ESIBOLSUK COIviPANY. An infornal meeting took place at the Admiralty on Sth January at which there were present the Kydrographer, Mr. seal, Mr. Laithwaite, and, from *&gt; y the Bahrein petroleum Company,^Mr. C.'V. Deacon, Engineer in charge of the submarine line, Mr. 3.J. Nelson, his assistant, and Captain Nelson, who will he in charge of the harhour installation. 2. The representatives of the Bahrein petroleum Company first discussed with the Hydrographer the technical aspects of the work which they propose to do in connection with the submarine line, and examined the charts which are being prepared for the Company. 3. A brief discussion followed on conditions in 'Bahrein, it being impressed on the Company's representatives that it was essential that they should keep in close touch with the political authorities and be guidea by them in their general conduct. The Company's representatives expressed their anxiety to cooperate to the full with the local authorities ana with H.M,G., Mr. Hamilton remarking that if only for selfish reasons it was to their interest to do so. He added that the importance of leaving nothing unaone to avoid any incident or difficulty had been impressed by the Company on the personnel who were now being sent out. 4. The Company's representatives stated that Mr. Deacon, Mr. Nelson and Captain Nelson would leave for Bahrein by air next week, arriving there about the 17th January/(13) 2. Januaiy. Hie 'El segundo' and its crew would arrive in Bahrein about 1st. March. 30 far as could be judged at present the work was likely to take about 3 months, but Iv:r. Deacon, in the interests of leaving a wide margin, was reluctant to commit himself to its completion before duly. Prom the Company's point of view, however, it was desirable to finish as quickly as possible, first, because of the onset of the hot weather; secondly, because the retention of the 'El segundo' immobilised her and also involved considerable expenditure on the wages of her crew. It appeared that the crew plus the expert party would number about 45. Arrangements would be made that all save possibly two or three should live on board. As regards arrangements for shore leave, etc., there woula be no aifficulty about combing with any desires which might be expressed by the local authorities &amp;• Mr. Ballantyne mentioned that it had now been decided that he should not go out to Bahrein with the submarine party, pressure of work making this impossible. He added that it was probable that Captain Nelson would remain on in oraer to look after the harbour installation after the main party had left. He rather contemplated that in due course he would be provided with an assistant,who would be an Englishman and who would understudy him with a view to ultimately replacing him. 6. Mr. Hamilton asked the present position as regards the enquiries which had been made of the Government of India as to their willingness to arrange for lighting and buoying and was informed that a reminder had been sent asking the Government of India to indicate whether they were prepared in principle to agree to assume/3. assume responsibility. He stated that if they were not prepared to do so for any reason the Company would 'be ready to make arrangements, hut that in that event, in pursuance of their policy of cooperation, they would ask us to inaicate what types, etc. of huoy should he laid down, so that there snould he complete conformity between any arrangements made by them and the general arrangements of the Government of India in the Gulf. 7» The representatives of the Company mentioned finally that two or three shiploads of technical material for the Company's work might be expected at Bahrein in the near future, 9th January 1934.

Ballantyne, jo I write with further reference to your letter of the 21st December last, on the subject of the lighting and 'buoying arrangements in connection with the operations of the Company at Bahrein, to say that we have now heard from the Government of India that, subject to the views of the Director of the Hoyal Indian Marine, which have been called for, the Government of India agree in principle to the proposed buoying, etc. on the conditions stated in your letter under reference They promise a further communication on receipt of the views of the Director of the, Hoyal Indian Marine and I will write to you without delay as soon as this has been received.

We await, with interest, your further communication. I unhesitatingly confirm your statement to the Government of India that the Company desires to work in full co-operation with the Government in this matter 0 From a letter received this morning, I see that there is a certain amount of local feeling in support of a light-ship off Muharraq, as an aid to navigation, as the flashing buoy there seems to be difficult of location. Apparently the s.s. u Eegistan' went aground at medium high tide on the night of the 31st December whilst seeking the buoy and was veri^ nearly lost. Do you know anything of the proposals and can the Company help in any way? Yours sincerely, (Sgd). H.3. BAIIMTYES. J.G.

We have discussed this once or twice since the date of my letter, and I undeistand that you nave felt some little difficulty in suggesting an appropriate definition, your view 'being, I think, that the only real safeguard is a substantial increase in the royalty figure. £• On the other hand, Ballantyne was persuaded with some little difficulty in Hovember to agree to consider 'very seriously' a fresh definition,and the Sheikh quite clearly attaches much importance to it. We shall probably be writing to Ballantyne in the very near future about refining (I am sending you a separate letter about this), and I think it would be a good thing at the same time to let him know what modification we in fact wish to propose in regard to 'commercially exploitable quantities' (whether our proposal takes the form of a suggestion for an increase in the dead-rent figure or not) so that the Company can be asked to consider this, as well as the question of some sort of assurance about refining, together with the other amendments ^hich we have already told them that we wish to see made in the mining lease. 3.

Mr. Ballantyne said that owing to misunderstanding the Question of filling the permanent vacancy in this appointment had not been taken up with san Francisco. It would he taken up at once.

He was anxious for a very early communication M/fe of the prohaole cost of the lighting and huoying arrangements to he undertaken hy the Vw Government of India and'^ advice as to the hest procedure ior Mr. skinner to aaopt in dealing with the matter. I suggested that we should give the Government of India, who would have to refer to the Director, Royal Indian Marine ana to the lighting and huoying authorities in the Gulf, a little longer, and when they had produced figures of cost possibly ask them for advice as to the authority with whom Mr. skinner should deal. (c) British 'personnel . Mr. Ballantyne left the statement attached to this record showing the position in June 1933 and January 1934. He explained that of classes II and III (subordinate personnel) the majority were, he 'lu fS'j n thought, British Indians, Bahreinis, .with a few IraQis, ~ M ojwiv f o Egyptians, and four or five N ejdis or miscellaneous nationalities. I said we should probably ask him to furnish a further statement in due course so that we could see what progress was being made with the introduction of British personnel. , Hf LJ 1 L. !

Please refer to my letter of December 7, 1933, which referred to two pieces of land on Sitra Island upon which the Company is now preparing to iastall certain facilities for shipping oil. the work is progressing rapidly and materials are en route for building tanks, pump house, submarine line, land line, etc. ife haTe been proceeding with this work under Article 2 of the Second Schedule to the Agreement jftich the Company has with Bis Excellency shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa Al Khalifah. We assume there is no objection to the installation of the facilities on tlie land mentioned. la the next to the last paragraph of the letter above referred to, it was stated that a rough sketch of the area selected was enclosed and that an accurate plan would follow. For your information wa have found that the short jetty with crane and the 5 acre yard as marked out on the western side of Sitra Island, cannot be used for the purpose planned. W are instead putting a short pi.r on the eastern side of the island approximately one mile south of the location o the large tanks, in conrersation with the Financial Adviser to the ferment of ahrein, it derelopes that he has had sow complaints fron owners of fishing traps in this vicinity, who beliefs that the installation of the pier aight interfere with their traps. This matter is under investigation by the Financial Advisor and will be reported to you in the near future. On the accurate plan promised above, we will stow all of the fish traps in question, the pier, the exact amount of land which we wish to use until it can be acquired under the Mining Lease, the location of the submarine line, tanks, and the land line to the fields.

I understand informally that tne Company constructed the pier at Sitrah Island without previous consultation with the local authorities. They apparently thought that the fish traps (which are valuable prawn traps) were disused as they saw no one tiiere by day,not appreciating that the traps are prawn traps and that prawns are only taken at night and at certain times. The value of the traps (based on recent transactions) is tnought to be in the vicinity of Bs.50,000/- (half a lakh).

Bj air mail. Kc. G/107-10/1.VI. Vrt'd 18th Februarys, The following is a resume of information from a short article in 'World Petroleum' of January 1934. Operations are being pushed ahead in Bahrain,where a plenti ful supply oi free-flowing oil of good quality has been dis covered. Crude pipeline to be constructed immediately,of which three miles is to be under the sea. Mention of Tankship SI Segundo. 'Presumably a refinery will be constructed at some suitable port where deep water is available and not too far from tiie pipe line terminus. In fact a refinery has also to be built in Eastern Saudi Arab/^ if oil is discovered there in commercial quantities. Drilling must start by September 1936.' Bahrain Oil is said to be 33-8-34 degrees l.P.I.gravity with 450 lbs shut-in pressure. Depth 2,000 feet. I S.6. MfilPC—Si—61(CSP)DCF—(G-1227)—21.3-30— ^oo.ooc, /2. n I2. 'Meanwhile,the world of oil is keenly interested in knowing just where this new supply will be marketed.' 'i /tere the oil concessions of Bahrein,Eastern Saudi Arab, Iraq,Persia,the Transferred territory and Egypt in the hands of a large number of operators instead of being controlled by a few major companies,some of whom are affiliated with governments,the Near East and adjacent markets would probably become a scene of a great oil war within the next three years. Even with the present control the situation has its tense moments and is not without complications that will take quite a little 'oil diplomacy' to handle satisfactorily.' 2. I understand from conversation with the Chief Local Representative that Bahrain Petroleum Company will be at great pains to conserve the gas pressure,and will,therefore,draw off the oil through very fine nozzles,for one well 3/8' (three -r eighth inch) was mentioned. I rather gathered that there was some doubt about there being as much steady gas pressure as might be desired. i | i Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent,Bahrain. /' , f.. t I.
