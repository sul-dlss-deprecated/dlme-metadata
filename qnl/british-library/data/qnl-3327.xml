No. PZ 6512/36, regarding the forced landing With reference to your of Imperial Airways aircraft ’’Horsa’', we have received a report from the Inspector-in-Charge of our Aeronautical Inspection Department at Heliopolis Aerodrome,- which states that the forced landing was in no way due to any mechanical defect, hut that it would appear to have been due to the pilot over-shooting the aerodrome at Bahrein in the darkness, with the result that a forced landing had to be made in the 'best possible territory'. the wireless bearings which were given to the pilot.

VICTORIA STATION, LONDON, S.W.I. HB/SB/2121 22nd September, 1936* Dear Mr.Clauson, I regret having been so long in acknowledging receipt of your letter of the 14th September, but I have already told you on the telephone that we are delighted to carry out Colonel Loch’s suggestion to give a gold watch to Sheikh Abdullah. We were able to obtain an 18 ct. gold half hunter, engraved as Colonel Loch suggested, and the watch was, in fact, despatched to Bahrein on last Saturday’s air mail. I horje that Sheikh AbdullaJi will like it, and that it will cement the friendship which he demonstrated in such a practical fashion when 'Horse' was in the desert. We made one minor alteration in the inscription; instead of referring to the 'Horsa', we used the letters 'R.M.A.Horsa', signifying 'Royal Mail Aircraft'. As you sent a copy of your letter to Mr.Burkett, it may be a convenience both to you and to him if I send him a copy of this reply, and I am therefore doing so. I would also like to say how very much we have appreciated all the help you have given us in this matter.

I would suggest that the company should present him with really good gold pocket watch, which might perhaps be inscribed in English 'To Sheikh Abdullah Bin Isa al C.I.E., from Imperial Airways in grateful remembrance of his assistance to the 'Horsa', 1936'. watch might be sent through Political Agent, who might be authorised at the same time to write letter conveying thanks of the Company and also of Government for his help, if watch could be sent soon by air mail so much the better. 1mmmam Forced Landing of Imperial Airways ^orsa 1 . 'All's well', etc., but I think we should certainly take up the matter with the Air Ministry as to why the forced landing took place. There will be, or has been, of course, an enquiry, and we should know what the results of this enquiry are. If the cause of the landing was the act of God, there is nothing more to be said. If, however, it was due to remediable causes, then we should press strongly that the remedies should be applied, and for the following political reasons. If a machine comes down in a desolate part of the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf, the Resident and the Political Agents under him (together with the R.A.F. and in certain circumstances the havy) are responsible for assisting towards the recovery of the passengers and the machines. In the present instance this assistance was most fortunately effective, but it might well have been otherwise. If the passengers of the 'Horsa' had been molested or robbed, or the machine injured/mm wmmm Cis: 2 . injured^ by some ■wandering^edouin, ■which would have been quite possible, we should have had a nice kettle of fish on our hands. Punitive action would have been indicated, but would have been difficult. If no effective action had been practicable, and if we had had to allow the robbery, etc. to go unpunished, our prestige would have suffered. If the culprits had been Sa'ud subjects, we would have been involved in complications with the Sa'udi Government. I imagine that the Air Ministry, whose machines and personnel ha^y been giving a lot of trouble on this occasion, would be only too willing to take up the matter with Imperial Airways - if the fault lay with them in any way, and was not due to circumstances beyond their control.iFHB/WB ) 4007 (COPi-^S CIRCULATED) ( 20 groups 0 U 6 DECYPHER OF TE LEG RAM, Prom l Lt 0 ColoG 0 Loch, C 0 IoE 0 , to Secretary of State for India,, Dated Shiraz, 8th .September, 1936 0 Received ll 0 3o pom*, 8th September, 1936 x Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Jedda, copy by post to Bahrain 0 My telegram No&lt;&gt;141, September 6th 0 Imperial Airways* agent at Bahrain expects Horsa to be ready by the end of this weeko Qt fUJ[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] R R n n v u U ;i: From SAUDI-iiRiiBIA.

Moreover it appears from acting Political Resident's telegram No. T/118 of September 1st to India Office that offers have already been made by brother of Sheikh of Bahrein (or possibly by Sheikh cf Qatar) to arrange with certain tribesmen for protection of aircraft. But it will still be necessary for aircraft co-operating in repair work to fly over territory occupied, or wandered over, by Saudi tribes, if not over territory under Ibn Saud's legal sovereignty. It is in any case important that Ibn Saud should not be given any excuse for disclaiming responsibility for any action which might be taken by tribes owing to him de facto allegiance in neighbourhood of area concerned. You should therefore unless you see objection, inform Saudi Government orally of approximate position of aircraft, and explain that steps are being taken to carry out necessary repairs to returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] (E 5568/545/25) To SAUDI ARABIA.

Air Headquarters, British Forces in Iraq^IJ flinaidi, Iraq. 17th January, 1935. ’—s I liy dear Sir Francis, j-he Air Ministry have recently referred to Ogilvie Forbes’ despatch of the 17th October, 1934 (No. 607. 120/49/34), in which the circumstances regarding the search for the three missing aero planes Oj. tne Bombay i’lying Club, in October last, by aircraft of the Royal Air Force were reported to the Foreign Office. The Air Ministry expressed their perturbation about the expense in volved in searches of this kind, and invited my predecessor's views as to the conditions which might be attached to private flights across Iraq. ^ lla ^ e examined this subject very extensively and in addition have taken the opportunity of consulting Mr. Wheatley, the Advisor on Air Matters to the Ministry of Economics and Communications. 3. xhe conclusion at which I have arrived, and one which ij snared by the Ministry of Economics and Communications, is that as few restrictions as possible should be placed on private flying. My own view is that restrictive regulations in Iraq especially, would probably produce a bad effect on neighbouring countries, whose regulations regarding private flying are already most severe. 4. I think, therefore, that all that is needed in the case of private aviators who apply for permission to fly across Iraq, is that they should be required to sign the following declaration before they are granted permission to proceed:- 'iir Route 1 from CerUfy th ?o 1 ^ ac&lt; l uai * t ® d Official low it. ^ 311(1 tnat 1 inten &lt;i to fol- for ) in^ S eT 1 ^ e n^ t0 „ Carry 3 “2 ppljr of fo °4 and water sufficient ^elf and passengers for two days. ^not to leave any recognised Air Port Pivil ^d ^ute^ojL t ^ Ut first obtained a weather ^ort 1 be notified?

The French Government, I understand, make a similar demand in respect of aviators wishing to fly across the Sahara. There is, however, a danger that such a proposal would appeal to the Iraq Government, and constitute an unwarranted restriction on private flying, which I believe they wish to encourage rather than hinder. Furthermore, the imposition of such a regulation would be agairtftthe spirit, if not the letuer, oi the Air Convention. I have therefore not included such a requirement amongst those which I think should be fulfilled by a private aviator applying for permission to fly across Iraq. 6. As regards the general question of searches, you are aware tnat these have, in the past, been carried out by the Royal Air Force, and I think you will agree with me that the Iraq Government cannot be allowed to expect that the Royal Air Force will continue to carry out such searches. Up to the present, the Royal Air Force has had to undertake these searches oix humanitarian grounds, because the progress of the Royal Iraai Air Force has not proceeded sufficiently far to justify their oein^ brought in. In future cases, it should now be possible for the Iraq Air Force, at least to co-operate with the Royal Air Force, with a view to their taking over the responsibility themselves later on. • j. oxio old oe grateiul if you would be good enough to let :iave your views on the opinions which I have expressed above and whether, in particular, you regard the conditions which I have proposed as sufficient to reduce the possibility of aviators losing themselves during flights across Iraq in future. At the same 1 suggest that you may care to write to the ForeignForeign Office in similar terms, because it will presumably be through the Foreign Office and the British Embassy, that any proposals emanating from the Air Ministry in regard to flights across Iraq, may be made to the Iraq Government. Yours sincerely, (Sd) ¥. G. S. Mitchell. Sir Francis H. Humphrys, GCMG, GOTO, KBS, CIS, British Embassy, Baghdad.My dear Air Vice-Marshal, Many thanks for your No # D.0/9525/34 of January 17th about the conditions which you considered might with advantage be attached to private flights across Iraq* 2, I agree with your proposals, with the exception of the suggestion contained in paragraph 6 of your letter that the Iraqi Air Force should in future be associated with the Royal Air Force in undertaking searches for missing aircraft, with a view to their taking over the responsibility themselves later 3. We have recently discussed this aspect of the question, and I expresseu the opinion, with which I understand you now agree, that it would be impolitic at the present stage to invite Iraqi machines to participate in such searches# My reason is as follows# In 1931 I was closely cross-examined at Geneva by members of the Permanent Mandates Commission as to the propriety of stationing British air forces in Iraq for a period of twenty- five years, after the country’s admission to membership of the League of ilations# I was asked how I could reconcile what virtually amounted to an occupation with the independent status which it was proposed to confer on Iraq. I quote the answer ' which I gave and which afterwards received the approval of His Majesty’s Governmentt 'The advantage from the point of view of Irag was that Bagdad was tending to 'become, to an even greater extent, a very 'important centre of air traffic between West and East. There 'were already German, French, Dutch and British air lines onera-H and develop and the importance of Bagdad as an 2 - !f enhanced, foreign air companies would require to he assured M that a high technical standard (in the matter of relief, life- ,, saving, aerodrome organisation, etc.) should he maintained. M The Iraqi Government was not yet i$ a position to provide the ’’British air force which would ensue the necessary confidence ’’would he greatly to the economic advantage of Iraq. ”he sent to Iraq in case of need unless there were some mucleus ”of a British air force and aerodrome organisation on the spot ”to receive them. Stores, spare parts, repairing workshops, ’’etc., would have to he maintained; and apart from this, it would ”he clearly impossible for air reinforcements to set out for Iraq ’’without the assurance that they could land at aerodromes there ”in safety. Reinforcements could not reach Iraq hy sea - that ’’was to say, via the Persian Gulf and Basra - in time to he ’’effective.” At the time, the Dutch, French and German members readily admitted the force of this argument as they said that, without the techni cal assistance of the Royal Air Force, it would he impossible for air lines to he operated across large stretches of desert in a country like Iraq. 4. I fear that if we invited the Iraqi Air Force to co—operate in a search for a missing air liner, such as the K.L.M. mail which recently crashed near Rutbah, the Iraqi Government would soon he emboldened to think that their own Air Force could perform these services without the assistance of the Royal Air Force and political ’’facilities and safeguards. Consequently, the presence of a 'Moreover, owing to the remote geographical position of 'Iraq, which was practically landlocked, the retention of a 'skeleton British air force in the country was essential in 'order to enable His Majesty’s Government to discharge the 'obligations of its alliance. Air reinforcements could not agitation- 3 agitation, which is likely to crop up from time to time for the removal of the Royal Air Force from this country, would be encouraged. I suggest, therefore, that searches and salvage operations should continue to be conducted, as in the past, by the Royal Air Force alone until the period of the present Treaty has only a few years to run. 5. The suggestions which you make about regulating journeys for private aircraft, if carried into effect, should obviate the occurrence of such expensive incidents as the search for the missing machines belonging to the Bombay Flying Club. If you agree with this view, I suggest that action should be taken on your letter omitting the proposals contained in para graph 6. Yours sincerely, (Sd) F. H. Humphrys.( &lt;3 Register No. P.

It appears that the Saudis at once issued instructions to their local authorities at Hail and Hasa to send out cars to search for the airmen, but Mr.Calvert was able to inform the Saudis on the evening of 11th October that the missing aviators hacr^been discovered by the R.A.F.in Iraq territory An expression of thanks was tendered to the Saudi Government for their assistance on behalf of the Viceroy and of the Government of India. The claim now presented by the Saudi Government for £176 gold seems somev/hat inflated, especially in view of the fact that the Saudis were not themselves successful in finding the missing aeroplanes,and indeed the propriety of such a claim being made by one Government from another is perhaps somewhat doubtful, but it would, I think, be politically undesirable to refuse payment, seeing that we did in fact invoke the help of the Saudi authorities. The total amount of the claim is comparatively small, and subject to the concurrence of the Government of India we / ■M &lt;m ygtgwmkma mmmm we might, I think, authorise the Foreign Office to pay it The Government of India will no doubt reclaim the amount from the aviators concerned. The Foreign Office proposed in their letter to postpone the actual payment of the claim until the Saudi Government had settled the debt owing to H.M.G. in respect of telegrams despatched on their behalf during the Saudi Yemen War, but it appears from the Jeddah Despatch of 2nd March now attached (P.Z.2043/35) that the Saudis have now paid this debt.

The total amount of this claim is 176 gold pounds, 12 Riyals and 4i- piastres. 2. Unless sir Samuel Hoare wishes to contest this claim, Sir John. Simon will 'be glad if he may be authorised to pay the amount in question on behalf of the Government of India, who will no doubt wish in turn to reclaim it from the aviators on whose behalf assistance was rendered. Repayment would be claimed by the Foreign Office from the India Office on the quarterly general claim. In view, however, of the recommendation made by Sir Andrew Ryan in paragraph 3 of his despatch, Sir John Simon would propose subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, to postpone the actual payment of the claim until such time as the Saudi Government have settled the debt owing to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in respect of telegrams despatched on their behalf■behalf during the Saudi-Yemeni war. 3.

(fc 19/19/') t - 'w# r Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith translations of two notes from the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs putting £.0.181 torward claims to a total amount of on© hundred and eighty one Rs.20.3i ^ld pounds, twenty riyals and three and a quarter piastres in respect of expenditure incurred in searching for British aircraft last year. The two cases would appear to he those which formed the subject of correspondence on which the most relevant papers are my printed despatch No. Ill of April 18th 1 34, enclosing a copy of a note to the Saudi Government and Kr. Calvert 1 s printed despatch No. 310 of October 10th enclosing a copy of another not© of the same kind. 2. I find it difficult to express an opinion on this entirely novel action on the part of the Saudi Government as I do not know what the general international practise is in such matters, if Governments ordinarily pay for assistance rendered by the authorities of other Governments, it would be difi icult to resist the claims In principle and invidious to question the details, although I can hardly think that the actual expenditure was as heavy as it is renresented to have been. 3. There can be little doubt that the Saudi Government have been impelled to make the claim by the insistence of His Majesty’s Government on their own pecuniary claims, the latest of The Right Honourable, Sir John Simon. G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc,, etc.of which is that for telegrams desoatched on behalf of the Saudi authorities during the Saudi Yemen war. Please see the correspondence ending with Mr. Calvert's orinted despatch No. 345 of the 26th November. If the present claim has to be admitted, I suggest that the amount should not be paid but should be set off against our claim in respect of these telegrams, 4. I may mention that in one of my recent conversations with ^uad Bey I adverted to both matters. I expressed regret that the claim in respect of telegrams had not been met at once, as 1 had taicen a great personal responsibility in the matter in my desire to help the Saudi Government and had done so wrongly, as the event proved. I said I was considering the Saudi claim put forward in the first of the enclosed notes. Fuad Bey professed to be shocked at the non-payment of the claim for telegrams. He was also a little shocked to hear that I had an official note regarding the Saudi claim, as he thought that it had been arranged that he should speak to me on the subject to begin with. A couple of days later I received the second of the enclosed notes adding the tidy little sum of sixty pounds gold to the first demand. 5.

The crews of the machines (a British gro\md engineer and four Indiana) were rescued juat in tine, when they had almost exhausted their email supply of water, 2, It la inexplicable how the four aeroplanes contrived to wander some 150 miles from their course in fine weather, when they had only to follow the Euphrates or the railway line on their way to Shaibah, But X understand that the British instructor, who was in charge of the party, had handed over control of the leading machine to an Indian pilot, fhen he awoke to the fact that railway and river were out of sight, he appears to have thought that the aeroplanes had been blown from their course to the ^ast of the Tigris and accordingly set a Bouth-^est course direct to Basrah, Actually they were already some dis tance West of the Euphrates and, when they finally landed, were no less than 150 miles from the railway, in the heart of the lonely Southern ,&gt;esert and almost in Baud! territory.

Sir, With reference to previous correspondence ending with my telegram Ho«23 of Fehruery 7, relative to violations of Sa’ddi territory hy British aircraft, I have the honour 2 to enclose copies of a telegram which I received late on March 31 from the political ^gent at Bahrain and of a note which I handed next morning to Fuad ey Hama a. I informed the political Agent hy telegraph on April 1st that 1 had taken action said I received two further telegrams from him dated April 1 and 53 in which he Informed me of the arrival of the Karmo at Bahrain and asked me to convey to the be’ftdi Government the thanks of the captain of the Hanna and his own for the assistance and kindness of the local authorities at Jubail* 2* The Political Agent’s telegram was brought to me after 8 pm* on l arch 31, when I was leaving Fuad Bey. He explained that he would not communicate that evening with the King who was giving his annual pilgrimage dinner. When I again saw Fuad Bey on April 1 he told me that a report had been received from the governor of Hue a to the effect that first aid was Being rendered to the Hanno. He added that when she had been got free of the mud further action would be considered. lie expressed perturbation at the recurrence of such violations of Ca’fldi territory. : ' B ^ The Right Honourable, Sir John Bimon, 0,C # S«X. , K.O.V.O.,N 3« I reiaind*d Fuad ney that I had had no reply to Hr». Hope Oil!*© note of i*eeeiaher 13 forwarding His pasty’s Gov«rnjaerit , e csonsidered proposals regaining landing grounds on the Ease Coast* I observed that, while His Majesty’s government did not contemplate the normal use of the proposed landing grounds hy other than service aircraft, they had adverted to the poesihillty of occasional forced landing by aircraft belonging to Imperial iiirways. Fuad 3ey said that the King had intimated a wish to postpone final considerations of the proposals of Hla }a esty’s Government until his return to the rejaz and that he, ^\iad Bey ? hoped to pursue the matter with me soon after the Pilgrimage* 4* Although I put the best face X could on the Hanno aifair, X think that the position in regard to flying over and forced landings by Imperial idrways machines in Ga’ddi territory requires reconsideration. In youi’ telegrsja Ho. 154 of December 7 it was stated that the /dr Ministry considered the likelihood of forced landings to be extremely remote* It ha© since appeared (Lee your telegram Ho* 11 of v ana ary 19; that a technical violation of territory by flying over took place on November 87, and the Sa*ddl Government have alleged the two further Instance^ oi llyi^g over by British aircraft on January 26 and February 3 mentioned in ay telegram under reference* Sven if these should prove not to h&amp;vt taken place or not to have been made by Imperial .airways machines, we have now had two clear cases of violation oi territory in six months* I doubt whether forced landings can still be considered improbable as aircraft which goes astray may easily have to alight and a landing was actually forced on the Harm©.6. The aa’ftdi Government are doubtless unduly jealous but they are what they are for bettex* of worse* Nothing indioposee them so much as apparent indifference to their sovereign rights. I have received no reply ae yet to my note of April 1 to the B:ini6ter ior Foreign Affairs, probably because of the interruption of all business owing to the pil^*image and the ensuing festival during the week ending /ipril 8* It is quite possible, however, that I may at any moment receive a reply embodying a protest. In these circumstancee and ae I had already on April 1 thanked Fuad Bey on my own account for what was being done at bubail, I preferred to ©wait a personal interview with Fuad Bey to express the thanks which the , olitical Agent at Bahrain has aakeu me to convey to the Sa’&amp;di Government. 6* As I have said, I think the question of the position vis-d-vie of the Ga f Mi CoYernaent in regard to flying over by non-service aircraft and forced landings like that of the a anno requires reconsideration. If you share this view, it will doubtless continue to be linked with that of emergency landing grounds for service aircraft, which Fuad Bey has promised to discuss with me further. I do not wish to anticipate the results of such discussion but I take this opportunity of drawing attention to what appears to as to be an unfortunate feature iii the list of landing grounds on the Arabian coast in paragraph 112 of the koyal Air Force Monthly Intelligence nummary for 'Iraq for January. The list shows as being 'available'' although ' to be used only in extreme emergency' four landing grounds between Kuwait and Bahrain. It seems to me that the caution given does not make it sufficiently clear that the use of these grounds, or at any rate of three of them (one appears to be in the Kuwait /neutralV ■HncB neutral aon©) at pi^esent Involves a violation of C a’tldi territory* I ti*ust that, although this does not appear fro© the list, it has been explained to the pilota concerned. 7* I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty's iyabassador at Bagdad, to the Government of India and to the tolitical resident in the ?erBian Gulf* X have the honour to be with the highest respect.

Captain Tv/eedie has promised a full report in due course, hut v/hen passing through Bahrain he wrote that the people had been n most friendly and helpful, providing tents, food, rope, wood etcetera. Particularly commend Customs official and Hudir’s brother. No rewards or payments were made. Would 'to like to convey/all concerned at Jubail my warmest thanks for wonderful assistance.

The n Hanno ?t landed at Jubail, where there is a Wireless Station and I appreciated the fact that, assuming thatthat the Wireless Station was working, an immediate report would he made to the Sa T udi Arah Government and that, in view of the protest wiiich was made against one of Imperial.Airways aeroplanes flying over Juhail in November 1932, it was almost certain that a protest would ensue. I, therefore, thought it advisable to forestall a protest on their part by making an immediate request for help through Kis Majesty*s Minister and by expressing our thanks without delay.

Blr, With reference to previous correspondence ending with my telegram No. 35 of February 7, I have the honour to 51 from the Political Agent at Bahrain and of a not© '-hich I handed next morning to Fuad Bey BatoKa. I Informed the Political Age^t by telegraph on April 1st that I hart taken action and I received two further telegrams from hi© dated April 1 and 2 in which he informed me of the arrival of the Henno at Bahrain and asked me to convey to the Sa^di Government ti e thanks of the captain of the Hanno and his own for the assistance and kindness of the local authorities at Jubail* 2. The Political Agent’s telegram was brought to me after 8 pm. on Parch 31, when T was leaving Fuad Bey. He explained that he could not communicate that evening with the King who was giving his annual pilgrimage dinner, ^hen I again saw Fuad Bey on April 1 he told me that a report had been received from the Governor of Hasa to the effect that first aid was being rendered to the Hanno. Tie added that when she had been got free of the mud further action would be considered. He expressed perturbation at the recurrence 3. X reminded Fuad Bey that I had had no reply to Mr. Hope Gill’s note of December 13 forwarding His Majesty’s Government's considered proposals regarding landing grounds 2 enclose copies of a telegram which I received late on March on The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.G.S.I., K.C.V.O., • t etc etc., etc.on the Heae Coast. I tfbserv^cl that, while Hia KaJ^sty’s Government possibility of occasional forced landings by aircraft belonging to Imperial Airways, thiad Bey said that the King had intimated a wifcii to postpone final consideration of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government until his return to the Hejaz and that he, Fuad Bey, hoped to pursue the matter with me Boon after the Pilgrimage. 4. Although I put the best face I could on the Hanno affair, I think that the position in regard to forced landings by Imperial Airways machines in Sa’ildi territory retires reconsideration. In your telegram No. 154 of December 7 it was stated that the Air Ministry considered the likelihood of such landings to be extremely remote. It has since appeared ( ee your telegram No* 11 of January 19) that a forced landing took place on Novem aircraft on January 25 and February 3 mentioned in my te under reference. Even if these should prove not to have piece or not to have been made by Imperial Airways machi have now had two clear cases in six months. It csn no lo contended that forced landings are improbable. 6. The Sa’Gdi Government are doubtless unduly jealo they are what they are for better or vorse. Nothing indisposes them so much as apparent indifference to their sovereign rights. I have received no reply as yet to my note of April 1 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, probably because of the interruption of all business owing to the pilgrimage and the ensuing festival did not coijfcvmplate the normal use of the proposed landing grounds 6ther than service aircraft, they had adverted to the during the week ending April 8. It is quitethat I w»*y at any 3ioiii*?nt rect Ive a reply embodying a proteet. In theat circumetences and as I had already on April 1 thanked ^uad Bey on my own account for what was being done at Jubail, I preferred to await a personal Interview with Fuad Bey to express the thanks which the olltieal Agent at Bahrain has asked me to convey to the Sa'ftdi Government. 6. As I have said, I think the ^uestl n of the position vis-a-vis of the Sa’ddi Government in regard to forced landings like that of the Hanno requires reconsideration* If you share this view, it will doubtless continue to be linked with that of emergency landing grounds for service aircraft, which Fuad Bey has promised to discuss with me further. I do not wish to anticipate the results of such discuss ion but I take this opportunity of drawing attention to what appears to me to be an unfortunate feature in .he list of landing grounds on the Arabian coast in paragraph 112 of the Royal Air Force Monthly Intelligence Summary for ’Iraq for January. The list shows as being 'available' although 'to be used only in extreme emergency' four landing grounds between Kuwait and Bahrain. It seems to me that the caution given does not make it sufficiently clear that the use of these grounds, or at any rate of three of them (one appears to be in the Kuwait neutral zone) at present involves a violation of Sa’Gdi territory. I trust that, although this does not appear from the list, it has been explained to the pilots concerned. 7.

Sir With reference to Colonial Office letter No.79121/30 M.E of the 24th September, I am directed by Mr.Secretary Henderson to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Charg6 d'Affaires at Jedda regarding the entry on the 19th September of two Royal Air Force flying boats into Ne jdi territorial 7 waters off Abu Ali Island. 2. It is understood from the Air Ministry that the two flying boats flew back to Iraq on the 20th September. It appears, therefore, that information of this incident #as only sent to Mr.Hope-Gill by the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq two days after the flying-boats had left Nejdi territorial waters. Mr.Henderson had intended, before the receipt of Mr.Hope-Gill’s telegram, to suggest, for Lord passfieId’s consideration, that instructions should be sent to the Acting High Commissioner that, in similar cases in future. His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda should be notified at the earliest possible moment, in order that there might be no delay in informing the Hejazi Government. It will now be observed that the Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs himself expressed regret that he had not been earlier informed. 3. It will be remembered that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda has on several occasions drawn attention to the sensibility of King Ibn Baud in all matters connected with aviation The under Secretary of State Colonial office.\ aviation affecting his territories, and has expressed the view that extreme care is required in these matters in order not to increase further the King's suspicion of, and possible opposition to, the desire of His Majesty's Government for facilities in connexion with the proposed Arab coast air route, Mr.Henderson trusts that Lord Passfield will agree to remind the Acting High Commissioner of the importance of these considerations, and to express the hope that it may be found possible to institute some arrangement whereby, should the Royal Air Force unfortunately be compelled to send a machine from Iraq in some unforeseen emergency to enter Nejdi waters without obtaining the previous permission of the Hejazi Government, telegraphic notification shall simultaneously be sent to His Majesty's Representative at Jedda. 4. A copy of a letter which is being addressed to the Air Ministry on this question is enclosed for Lord passfield's information. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, —i—Sir, With reference to your letter Ko.S.29268/Pt«ll/s.6 of September 26th, I am directed by Mr.Secretary Henderson to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a letter to the colonial Office enclosing a copy of a telegram from His majesty’s Charge d*Affaires at Jedda on the subject of the entry, on September 19th, of two Royal Air Force flying-boats into Kejdi territorial waters at Abu All Island. , 2. In view of the considerations advanced in the enclosed letter, I am to express the hope that the Air Council will cause Instructions to b© sent to tne Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, with a view to ensuring that any similar accidental infringement of Nejdi territorial waters which may take place in future is notified to the Hejazi Government* through the High Commissioner at Bagdad and His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda, at the earliest possible moment* I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Secretary of the Air Ministry. \ \ xc'ii?

I approve course of action proposed, subject to following considerations. Since delivery of spare parts necessarily in volved entry of flying boat into Nejdi territorial waters, it cannot be argued that violation was purely accidental. It was however limited to time and extent necessary to supply spares and carry out technical adjustments which were essential to enable wirises installation to function. In view of importance which has been attached from the first to use of wireless both for efficiency of force and safety of personnel (see my telegram No. 118 of (November 6th) 1929), Air Ministry think it may be preferable not to attempt to disguise fact that main purpose of flights of April 15th and January 24th (see below) was to give assistance in connexion with wireless. If delivery of spare parts only is referred to, further enquiries regarding nature and purpose of latter may be made and prove difficult to answer. You may however use your discretion both as to extent of explanations to be given to Hejasi government and as to aspect of incident to be emphasised. Air Ministry state that flying boat flew to Darin fromfrom Basra and not from India. You need not, however, correct latter statement (as reported in paragraph 6 of your despatch No. 126 (of May 31st)) unless you consider correction important. It has now Been ascertained that one other un authorised British flight from Iraq to Darin and Bade also took place on January 24th, for purpose of assist ing to establish two-way communication on wireless set lent to Kejazi government (see my despatch No. 191 (of June 18th) now on its way to you).

They are agreeable to it being left to Sir a. Ryan’s discretion to decide whether the Hejaz Government should be informed of these visits, but the Council are inclined to think that it would be preferable that they should be so informed as the circumstances in which they were made were so clearly in the interests of the operation of the Hejaz Government's aircraft. 4. as regards the first part of paragraph 2 of Sir A. Ryan's letter, the Air Counoil are of opinion that in view of the emphasis which has been placed upon the importance of W/T equipment to the working of the Hejas Air Force, it would on the whole be preferable not to attempt any reticence as to the exact purpose for which the flights were undertaken.

Copies of this letter (together with copies of Oroup Captain Courtney^ letter to Ur* Rendel) are being sent for information to the Colonial Office and Inuia Office. I am, 3ir, Your obedient Servant,Air Ministry, 11th June, 1930. o , Dear You will recollect at our meeting here on Ibth May we discussed the question of Humphry's' telegram No.226 dated 18th May 1930 to the Colonial office in^ which he referred to the three visits having 'been paid by Flying Boats to Darin and added that they had been made solely in the interests of the Hedjaz Air Force. I have now received particulars from our Headquarters, Baghdad, of the three visits thus mentioned. The first was on 31st December 1929, when a flying boat conveyed the last batch of Hedjaz Air Force personnel to Darin Island. This would, of course, fall under the ^authorised” category. The second was made on 24th January 1930, when a W/T mechanic was flown there to establish two-way communication on the W/T set loaned to the ‘HeTJaz Government. The final visit and the one which called forth the protest was made on 13th April as Morris had in the meantime experienced trouble with the set and had been unable to maintain communica tion. You may wish to communicate these details to Sir Andrew Ryan as ample evidence that the visits were made solely in the interests of the Hedjaz Air Force. Yours (Sgd.) C.L. Courtney. G.W.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your telegram No* 72 of May 15th relative to the Hejaz Government^ complaint of a violation of Nejd territory by British aircraft on April 13th. I have delayed final action on this telegram for two reasons, al though as you will see I have dealt with the matter orally in the meanwhile. 2. It appears to me that, while the Hejaz Nejd Air Force has been provided with wireless for very excellent reasons, we have more or less imposed it on the Hejaz Government and it would there fore be better not to refer to it In the present connection# On the other hand, as we have a very reasonable explanation to offer of a technical violation of territory, I consider that anything in the nature of an apology should be toned down as much as possible# I feel this the more strongly at the present time, because I am exerting myself to create a favourable Impression at the outset of my mission but would not wish the Government here to think that I am bent on pleasing them at all costs. 3# 1 had occasion to see Sheikh Fuad Hamza yesterday morning about the case of riiot Hamilton, on which I hope to report in a few days. I took the opportunity of telling him that the flirht of which Emir Feisal had complained was undertaken In order to provide the Air Force with necessary spare parts, that there had been no flying over the coast, that the state of the wind had apparently caused a diversion over Darin Island, and that, while this did constitute a violation of territory in the absence of previous permission, the violation was of a technical nature.said that I was anxious to place him in possession of the facts without delay, as Emir Peisal had been perturbed by mis representations in the Egyptian press, but that I wishod to obtain* some further information before replying officially to the Emir's note. 4. Fuad Hamza's only comment was to enquire where the flying boat had come from. I said that I was not fully informed on this point, but that X believed it had come from the North. 5. If you see no objection, I would propose to state in my written reply that the flirht was undertaken for the purpose of supplying spare parts; to explain how the flying over incident had arisen; and to add that, while His Majesty's Government rerretted that there should have been any flight over Nejd territory without a previous arrangement, they are confident that the Hejaz Government will realize that the breach was a purely technical and accidental one. I should be grateful for telegraphic instructions as to whether you agree generally and whether I may use discretion as to the exact wording of my reply. It would be useful if I could be furnished with the material for an answer to the question put to me by Sheikh Puad Hamza. 6. X have not yet studied all the files relative to the Hejaz. Hejd Air Force but my general feeling is that, having newly arrived, I should be particularly cautious in handling the various questions dealt with in them, in order not to encourage the suspiciousness inherent in Oriental minds and to avoid creating the impression that His 'ajesty's Government are concerning themselves overmuch with the Force or wish to make use of ite British personnel for their own ends, I have, etc., (simed; Andrew Ryan#B 12 b ft Communications on this subject should be addressed to— Tim Under Secretary of State, Qolonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted : ^ 'io % r—p' f! 3726 j/’ ! f 1 ■ Subject: PUT AWAY, WITH Reference to previous correspondence: Q&gt;- Letter r the Colonial Office of the jrom * ^ J &lt;^3° Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

With reference to your letter No. H.Q/269 dated the 7th May, 1930, concerning a protest by the Hijaz Government against a British aeroplane arriving at DARIN ISLAND on the 13th April, 1930, and flying over NAJD Territory on this and other occasions, these flights were undertaken for the sole purpose of rendering assistance to the Najd Air Force. 2, It will be remembered that in order to help the Najd Air Force His Majesty’s Government lent the Hijaz Government a wireless set for the purpose of establishing a W/T station at DARIN ISLAND. From time to time, there were technical troubles at this station and while there was no obligation on the part of H.K.Government in connection with it, it was felt that there was a moral obligation to see that it was kept in proper working order. Accordingly, on were no less than three ocasions expert mechanics/specially sent by air to examine it, and on each occasion spares were supplied without any question of charges being raised.7 . 3. The visit to DAEIN I3LAKD on the 13th April, 1930, was in connection with this h'/'T station. The Flying Boat was on its way back from INDIA and it was ordered to put into DARIN ISLAND to deliver spares and adjust the set. This visit was undertaken at great inconvenience. As the visit was solely for the benefit of the Hijaz Government it was never anticipated any objection would be raised, en the contrary, it was hoped the Hijaz Government would appreciate the efforts made to help them. 4. It is desired to point out that on other occasions help has also been rendered to the Hijaz Air Force in a different manner. 5. when Hijaz aircraft arrived at the camp of the King of the Hijaz and Najd in the Southern Desert in February last, they had not sufficient petrol to take them back to DARIN. They would have remained stranded at the camp for some considerable time until supplies could have been sent out to them under Hijaz arrangements over difficult country were it not for the assistance rendered by the Royal Air Force. Aircraft were specially detailed to convey petrol to them by air and all that was asked was that the Hijaz Government should pay for the petrol supplied. The services of Royal Air Force aircraft were willingly provided without charge. 6. On another occasion, Hijaz aircraft were stranded at Kuwait for want of oil. Again the Royal Air Force supplied their needs without any question of recompense.mmar&gt; am 7. Possibly when KING IBN SA f IE) is put in possession of all these facts, he will be grateful instead of indignant. (Signed) G.S.BURNETT. Air Commodore.

The correspondence generally includes reports on the incident, and covers measures taken to render assistance, the submission of apologies to the Government of Saudi Arabia, and occasionally the issue of rewards for assistance given. It also includes the details of an expenses claim made by the Government of Saudi Arabia in January 1935 for assistance rendered in the search for three lost Indian pilots of the Bombay Flying Club in October 1934: see folios 70-86. It further includes some discussion relating to regulating private flights over Iraq in response to this incident, the results being the issue of new regulations which can be found on folios 47-48.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan, later Sir Reader William Bullard), HM Chargé d'Affaires at Jedda, HM Ambassador to Iraq (Sir Francis Humphrys), officials of the Air Ministry, and officials of the Foreign Office. There is also correspondence with officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Saudi Arabia. Most of the correspondence in the file does not directly involve the India Office; correspondence in the file has frequently been forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
