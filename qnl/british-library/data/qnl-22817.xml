I have the ho .our to inform your 1’xcellency that during the course of the past few months, four separate consignments of silver rupees have arrived here from India in ships of the Mo^hal Line. Ihe first cousi g^ment, recorded at paragraph 145 of the Jedda Report for May# arrived by the s. s. H Alavi* about the middle of May and consisted of Rupees 400#000« It was followed on June 10th by a second consignment of an unspecified quantity of specie by the s.s. 'jehanjjLr*, and in September by a further shipment also by the s. s. ,, Jehangir ,, , of rupees 120,000, to ^hich a reference was made in Jedda Report for that month, paragraph 290, and by a consignment of twenty- five cases contai. i g silver coins, estimated to amount to about Rupees 100,000, by the s.s. 'Islami 1 * on the 8th October. XXX \ 4. It may seem somewhat singular that Ibn Saud should import Rupees for Nejd through jedda, and not via the Tersian Gulf, but it map well be that he prefers in this ii stance to use a Saudi port. I should, however, be interested to learn from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf if similar shipments of Indian currency have come to the notice of officers at Bahrain, or elsewhere.

The subsidies to the Tribes were also paid in rupees instead of dollars ( (a great saving to the Government, of course!).

Adviser, With reference to P.A f s letter regard ing the quantity of silver, in rupees, now available in the kingdom of f Ibn Saoud. The merchant who monopolises the trade with the mainland is Haji Abdulaziz Ali al- Bassam. He, on being asked about the silver in rupees and dollars exported from Bahrain, without the least hesitation opened his books and gave me the figures as follows:- Silver exported by him during the past nine months 5 lacs. (dollars) But during the first three months of the year 1354, no silver was sent at all, which means that 5 lacs of dollars were exported in six months alone. He also said that no rupees were exported to Hassa at all during these six months. But he understood that during these six months a quantity of rupees has come from mainland to Bahrain, and as reason, he said, King Ibn Saoud had, when the market was favourable, imported a large quantity of rupees from India, and had started paying all the officials f wages in rupees as this was more profitable than paying them in dollars. The officials and men, on receiving their wages in rupees, used to change them in the market. These rupees gradually found way into Hassa. Thus some rupees have come from Hassa to Bahrain,Bahrain, but no rupees *ere exported to the mainland from Bahrain. 2. The other merchant whom I approached was Dhamanmal Isardas, (the senior parter of this firm is Mr. Tikamdas Dhamanmal) before he went away to India. D.I. (as he is always called) said that no rupees were exported to the mainland, but during the period of six months, many oonsigjimaits of rupees have come to Bahrain, from Hassa, which, according to him, was very surprising, as, never during his stay in Bahrain has he heard of consignments of rupees coming to Bahrain from the mainland. He occa sionally dealt with the mainland, in specie^, bringing dollars from Aden and India, when rates were favourable. He says that according to him, the quantity of dollars sent to the mainland during the current Arabic year should be approxi mately 10 lacs, and rupees, nil. 3. Kanoo f s office game me the figures as 360,000 dollars. Jasim Kanoo tells me that Shaikh Mohomed Tawil, when he returned to Hassa, took with him one lac of rupees and that during the six months immediately preceding, a quantity of two lacs of rupee s worth of notes and 12,000 sovereigns have come from the mainland. Jasim Kanoo himself does not deal muchA-a- ^ -f^c i^tU- |y|_ ■ u*~*- V|' much in specie^ especially with the mainland. He obtained these parti culars from local brokers. 4. To verify the statement that Shaikh Mohomed Tawil took with him a quantity of rupees to Hassa, I asked Aqil Khunji about any silver going to Hassa. He does not say anything to the effect that Shaikh Mohomed Tawil took with him any rupees, consequently the quantity of rupees taken by Tawil can be regarded negligible. Aqil Khunji says:- Krom Rabi al-Thany onwards until Ramadhan 1354, the dollars brought to Bahrain amount approximately to 3 lacs. Before this period, dollars used to be exported from Hassa. The statements of Jasim Kanoo and Aqil Khunji are enclosed; other particulars were obtained by me verbally. Haji Abdulaziz Aly f s figure is the correct one as he alone deals in this category of business, besides, he gave me the figures from his account books. As I submitted to you before verbally, D.I. had said that he had a suspicion that rupees were being minted somewhere in the interior of Nejd and he, on being asked whether I could divulge this of his to you, said rt yes TT . While approaching each one of the above four merchants, I kept on saying,-4- 4 saying, as reason for this enquiry, that the government of Bahrain were interested in the amount of silver and gold fcurren/t in the Bahrain market, especially in view of the comparatively better financial Conditions now existing^ and that the government would like to know what amount of silver and gold is imported into Bahrain, what quantity of this is re-exported, and what remains in Bahrain. Respectfully submitted, January 4th, 1936. £7 dr/3© n*M* should 'try t.0 find out. how the nasa Merchants and the bedouins regard the change of currency from dollars to rupees, and how the change has effected trade. 6»L» 9.12.35 All traders, with the exception of v/holesale merchants, who inport their goods direct from outside, have been subject to losses since the introduction of the rupee currency owing to the fluctuation of the dollar, on which all their local dealings depend, xhe bedouins do not accept the rupee except when they get it as present, in which case tney soon exchange it into gold pounds and then convert it into dollars, xhe change did not cause any increase or decrease in trade, but has placed the outside merchants in a better position and saved them of the losses to which they were subject under the dollar currency. I have been told by various merchants who have recently come from different parts ox ba'udi Arabia that the rupee is strictly enforced by the State officials at nasa and niyadh only when collecting taxes and that in other parts of sa'udi Arabia the dollars still dominate. change is to get rid of the custom of giving presents in dollars and thus save large sums to the state treasury, anc to fix the amount of revenue on firm basis in order to enat the uoveminent to balance their budget. 7.1T36 - WiH you Kindly include the essence of this in draft about rupees traffic. 7.1.56 A.P.A.itote on the Rupee-Maria Theresa Dollar position in ilaoa and Banrain. It v&gt;as reported from Jedda in ^oveosber li?5 tnat 1.620.000 rupees had been imported through Jedda s^nce May and a further 400,000 rupees were received at Jedda during the first week of December, feE^ing a total of 2,050,000 rupees for the year, 2 . inquiries made in Bahrain about the beginning of the year shewed that there had recently been an unusual flow of doi.iars from Bahrain to oa’udi Arabia. Istinates of the amount so shipped in 1«&gt;3S variea from 1,000,000 to 300,000# Probably 500.000 is a fair figure to accept. No rupees had, so far ~s was known, been chipped from Bahrain to Sa*udl Arabia in this period. It is said that on one occasion Muhammad ai Ts wil, Director General of Customs for the Icsa Ports, took vita him 100,000 rupees, but this couj-d not be rubstantiated. It ms stated that 200,000 rupees in notes and 12,000 sovereigns in gold had reached Bahrain in the rast six months of 1955. It was known that a considerable quantity of gold had been shipped away from Bahrain to Great Britain, India and ’Iraq. 3. Dollars neve been bought and brought to Bahrain from kuscat (and Kuwait) and the considerable fluctuation of the rupee rate for 100 dollars at Muscat during 1935 is shown bexow: February Rs.110 August March 110 September 136/6 April 150 October 136/8 May 143/8 November 187 June 132 December 117/4 July 151 4 (i).It appears that the reason for the import of rupees into Jedda (though-it is not clear why tnat route was chosen) w as (a) tnat the Sa’udi Arab Government wished to link their currency to some stable and knov/n currency as their own riyais /were© v.ere not recugnlsec abroad, snet (b) that the •b&amp;’udl Arab Governicent hoped to be able to aia^te a profit by using whichever coin happened to suit them in their various transactions, and ' v c) that the use of the rupee would save the Sa’udi *-rab Governinent from the losses consequent on having to buy a fluctuating coin for making presents to bedouin and so on. ^.ii) • The plan was put into effect in AA asa and Kajd about July 1935 and tribal allowances were paid in rupees (at what rate of exchange as compared with the old Maria Theresa co-iar payments is not known). (iii). It is said that so far tax collection in rupees is enforced onxy in Hasa and ^ajd and that in other parts of ua'ual Arabia the ^aria Theresa dollar can still be used for the payment of revenue, but not for the expenditure of public monies. Payments of officiaus and tribal allowances are said to be made in rupees only, which has led to a considerable saving to tns Government. (iv). The change is said to be most unpopular among the bedouin and Government officials to whom it mesns a considerable loss. It is largely zhe desire of the beaouin to change their rupees into dollars which has led to the shipments of dollars from Bahrain. The change is said not to heve affected trace, but the local merchants and the retailers are said to have suffered losses. Wholesale merchants who iurport from abroad are, on the other hand, said to have benefitted from the change. (v). The profits made on the money market in Bahrain has been a welcome help during the depression of the pearling season. 5 . There is a rumour, of which no real evidence has been found, that rupees are being counterfeited in ^cjd. Many counterfeit rupees are in circulation on the Arab ^ittorai of the Persian Gulf, but reports of counterfeiting in the past/6 © have not, so far as is known in Bahrain, been substantiated. 6. The above information has been sifted as carefully as circumstances permit, but should be accepted v/ith caution. sd/- G.

Memorandum I am informed by the Manager of the Eastern Bank — and have heard from other sources — that the abnormal export of rupees from Bahrain to Kuwait and to Hassa is continuing. During the last month from 16,000 to 20,000 rupees have been exported daily and about 30,000 riyals have been brought to the Bank daily. The cause appears to be (l) that there is a premium on rupees in Kuwait. (2) that owing to the war the general public in Hassa have less confi dence in the stability of the riyal than the rupee and therefore people are sending their riyals to Bahrain where they are changed into rupees with the result that the Bahrain bazaar is being flooded with riyals. In my opinion this is an undesirable condition and I think steps should be taken to restrict the export 9 v.- 2 - C§) export rupees to genuine trade transactions, ihic could be done by imposing an export duty on rupees in bulk or an import duty on riyals.

Nevertheless I understand it is a fact that the riyal has nothing like the same silver content as the rupee, and it is not altogether desirable that the Manama bazaar should be flooded with these coins. But I do not feel competent to advise whether any restriction on the imports of riyals into Bahrain or the exports of Indian rupees to Hasa should be imposed* Yours sincerely, ±ne Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel C.

(iii) The rial shortage has been aggravated by the fact that jfcials can be bought in Bahrain at about Re*101 for 100 rials; while the price in Kuwait is about Rs* 103 for 100 rials# Merchants have therefore been buying up rials in Bahrain in order to sell at a profit of roughly 2% in Kuv/ait# (iv) Increased activity of the Oil Companies in Qatar and Hasa has caused a demand for additional currency# Luch of this, of course, finds its way back to the Bank; but the time-lag is considerable. In addition, the state of Bahrain - Qatar relations means that the Qatar money finds its way to the Dubai, rather than the Bahrain, market 3# I learn, however, that the bsudi Government recent ly imported 2 million rials; and with the initial panic caused by the war gradually resolving itself, the supply of rials may be expected to increase, and thereby ease the demand for rupees# 4.

I think this matter reouires further investigation. The information wh^h you have given in your Express letter No. C/679 of the 25th August 1940 to the Political Resident does not entirely agree with the situation that existed, at any rate, a fev; months ago. At that time the market in Bahrain was flooded with rivals to such an extent that the Bahrain G-overnment at one time even considered prohibiting their import. Furthermore the riyal was suspect in.Hasa and I should very much doubt indeed v/hether the local popu lation T C7*re hoarding them. 3. 1 should also very much doubt v/hether this considera- s ble quantity of rupees which is exported to Hasa ever comes back to Bahrain. Thus we find ourselves in the position that the Eastern Bank is supplying between Rs 36 lakhs and Rs 42 lakhs per annum in silver rupees to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, Captain 1. B. Howes, I.A., Bahrain. plus considerable quantities to/- __to the Saudi Goveriunent, little of v/hich we ever see ^ a in. In 'fact on the figures quoted in your letter rt is not far from^truth to say that the whole of the ex-nort of silver rupees from India goes ultimately to Saudi Arabia, whence as I have said recovery is extremely doubtful in present circumstances. (It is I believe a fac ° that the Saudis used to buy back.riyals from Bahrain v;iuh rupees but apnarently that has now ceased). 4. The matter is extremely serious, as it seems to me. ihe positive danger exists that because of the operations of CQ-lifornia Arabian Standard Oil Company and the Saudi Government itself through Bahrain,Bahrain may be deprived of fresh stocks of silver currency from India. • L sending back the whole file to you and you or Hallows might have a preliminary talk with Gunn on the points raised in this letter in preparation for my return. I will go into the matter more completely when I get back to Bahrain. Yours sincerely,41 @ Confidential \ D.O.No.C/738 Dated the 28th September 1940 t I think I should make a few comments on Howes* Express letter No.C/679 dated the 25th August on the question of the export of Hupee Coin from India. In the first place I do not believe that Saudi riyals have been 'hoarded”. They were most unpopular in Eastern Arabia and the silver content is insufficient to encourage hoarding. There has certainly been a shortage in Hasa, due possibly to speculation or to an inadequate coin issue, but ngt, I am sure y to hoarding. In the last we* k or two the position seems to have eased, and both riyals and silver rupees are coming back to Bahrain in considerable quantities. This may indicate that the new issue of Saudi riyals is spreading over the country and possibly the Saudis may be in a position soon to reimpose their ban on other coinage. That, however, is a pure guess and the fact remains that at the moment the Cali fornia Arabian Standard Oil Company still take^ up to as.3 lakhs a month in silver rupees to cover their wage bill in Hasa. Now Howes has reported that the Eastern Bank here estimate their annual requirements in silver rupees at 50 lakhs. Since the Saudi Government themselves have taken 12 lakhs In rupee coin from here in th last six months and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company demand on present averages is round about 35 lakhs a year, it is only The Hon*ble Lieutenant Colonel C.G. Prior, C.I.E,, too /- Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, P.T.O. u ( Camp, Shiraz.too obvious where most of the Eastern Bank imports go. Of course, rupees start coming back at times, as is happening at present, but we cannot be certain of a steady in-flow. Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast work on rupee coinage, and a shut-down of exports from India would have a paralysing result. My object is writing this letter is to obviate the possibility of my 'clients' suffering for the sins of Saudi Arabia; and I would suggest that if India k is seriously perturbed at the flow of coin through Bahrt * the/&gt;,Government should first make enquiries through Jedda about the present and expected riyal position. V/hether or not threats to cut off supplies of rupees may be necessary is not for me to say; but whatever action be taken vis-a- vis the Saudis I trust that our Sheikhdoms will be exempted from it. I could not guarantee to stop all smuggling across to Hasa but I could at least keep it pretty low if the requisite legal powers were given. Yours sincerely, rConfidential.

March 1944. IMPORTM T Ibn Saud has requested that His Majesty's Government should send a ?senior military expert accompanied by four or five capable officers representing different branches of Ser vice to Saudi Arabia to train and establish his small army on sound modern lines. He stated that he did not wish His Majesty's Government to take away officers serving with fighting forces but considered some reserve officers or some incapacit ated and unfit for active service would be most suitable. He requested that they should be Sunni Moslems and asked for early nomination and arrival. He added that ?America ns were prepared to train his army but that he looked to us for~~the assistance he required. 2. Ibn Saud also stated that he was very disappoint ed with the financial control in Saudi Arabia and begged that His Majesty's Government would at once send a Government financial expert to reorganise the financial structure and establish it on a firm basis. As most of the work will have to be done in Mecca he requested that expert should be Sunni Moslem. As in matter of military expert he emphasised £hs great importance which he attached to early selection and arrival of expert and begged that His Majesty's Government would not disappoint him. 3. I should be grateful if you would telegraph ? as to whether there is any likelihood of Incia being able to supply financial and military ?experts in event of it being decided th^t we ?rather than America should provide them.

In the course of confidential interview Ibn Saud he had appointed Amir Mansur, one of his sons asCommander-in-Chief Saudi Arabian Army, He had every confidence in Mansur, who was both intelligent and loyal. He knew little of army matters, however, nor did Saudi Arabian officers. For this reasoh he requested that His Majesty*s Government would send a senior military expert accompanied by four or five capable officers representing the different branches of the Service to Saudi Arabia to train and establish his small army on sound modern lines. 2. As in the case of financial expert he attached greatest importance to this natter and sincerely hoped His Majesty’s Government would accede to his request. He did not wish His Majesty's Government to take away officers serving with the fighting forces but considered some reserve officers or seme incapacitated and unfit for active service would be most suitable. He again requested that they should be Moslems of Sunnis persuasion and begged for their early nomination and arrival in this country. 3. He added that he knew the Americans were prepared to train ^ his army and had even offered to do so but that he did not wish to let them do this. His faith was in His Majesty’s Government and the British and he looked to us for the assistance both in financial and military matters which he now requires.

A refusal on the part of His 'Majesty’s Government to either or both of these requests would cause him grave disappointment. He realises that United States would like to take over training of army and its officers but he neither wishes their interference in internal administration of the country nor can they supply Moslem officers. 2. He has for some time past realised the rottenness of the financial administration of the country. , * It is like date palm wood^', he said ’’ whereas I wish it to be as sound as steel and only the British can help me in this respect.” 3. I venture to hope that in the best interests of the country and our friendly relations with Ibn Saud you will accede to his request. 4. I did not want to raise the question of payment for these services and suggest that in view of financial penury of the country we should shoulder the burden at present. ( Copies sent to fir.

The file contains correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire; the Political Agent at Bahrain; Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Advisor to the Government of Bahrain; C W F Skrimshire and M Gunn, the Eastern Bank Limited, Bahrain; Yousuf bin Ahmed Kanoo [Yūsuf bin Aḥmad Kānū]; the Residency Agent, Sharjah. There is also correspondence from the India Office and the Government of India, which has been forwarded to the Political Agent by the Political Resident.The correspondence for 1935-36 (ff 3-21) concerns the import of large quantities of Indian rupees into Saudi Arabia via the port of Jedda and Persian Gulf ports, due to the Saudi government’s preference of paying officials and tribal subsidies in rupees instead of dollars. The essence of this situation is explained in a report by Loch, entitled 'Note on the Rupee-Maria Theresa Dollar position in Najd, Hasa and Bahrain', sent to the Political Resident on 3 March 1936. The correspondence for 1939-40 (ff 22-49) concerns further abnormal exports of rupees from Bahrain to Kuwait and Hassa (al-Aḥsā’) due to a lack of confidence in the stability of the Saudi Arabian riyal as a result of the Second World War; also discussed is the possibility of an embargo being placed on the export of rupees from India to Saudi Arabia and the impact that that would have on the Trucial Coast states and Qatar. The final section of correspondence for the year 1944 (ff 50-55) concerns a request from ‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd (Ibn Saud) for the British government to send senior military and financial experts, preferably Sunni Muslims, to Saudi Arabia to aid the establishment of an army and reorganise the financial structure of the state.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Currencies</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002a3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
