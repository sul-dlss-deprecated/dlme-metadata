The Government of India thus met from the Afghan Fund the difference between the air and sea fares or Ife* 1072/13/-(=£80/9/-). This was done as a snecial case in order to save his salary for the oeriod of journey by sea which was oayable by the Government of India under the terms of his agreement. Assuming however, that the journey by sea would have taken an$ 9 her three weeks, the extra salary oayable would not have amounted to more than £42. There is thus no case for the Government of India to consider any claim from Mr. Pearson. 3.

I am afraid it would be quite out of the question to suggest that the Afghan Government should accept this charge under clause 10 of the contract as Pearson's contract had already been ended and his passage home could not possibly be considered as a journey on duty. The clause was inserted merely to cover the possibility of Pearson being sent to India or elsewhere on duty for the Afghan Government as had frequently happened in the case of Bradley. 2. There might be a case for including the charge under para 8 of the contract as a part of his 2nd Class fare, toe originally informed the Afghan Government that they should pay £63/- which was the cost of a 2nd Class passage plus railway fare from Peshawar to Bombay and this they did. Before we ask them to pay more I think ought to know what exactly happened to this money. £63 was paid to the Government of India vide Legation' Express Le tter No. 464/43 dated 29th December 1945 , but we do not know what vas done with it. Pearson we believe persuaded the R.A.F. to take him home by air. if the Government of India paid the £63 received from the Afghans or more for this air passage it might be legitimate for us now to tell the Afghan Government that the amount we asked for for a 2nd Class fare should have been £69-2-11 (say £70) instead of £63, and to ask them to pay us the difference though the morality of such a procedure is doubtful, if however no charge was made for the passage and the money is still lying with the Government of India it would be reasonable that the amount now asj&amp;ed for should be paid by the Government of India to Pearson. Another possibility is that Pearsin succeeded in getting the £63 out of the Government of India himself on the ground that he had himself arranged for his passage home through tne R.A.F., in which case he has no claim whatever and in fact should properly be made to refund the balance, In any case if, as appears to be the case, Pearson travelled by ' air merely to suit his personal convenience his whole claim seems to be flimsy in the extreme. Had ne travelled by sea this expense would presumably not have been incurred. 3. If you could let us know what was actually done we shall then be in a position to decide on the next move. 4. Baxter.

Begins ; Ministers have considered the very grave situation oai*i &lt;a d by the shortage of cereals. During the discussions which the Minister of Food had in Washington at the turn of the year it was estimated that in the first.six months of 1946 the requ irements of the various countries for imported wheat would be some 17 million tons and the wheat available for export 1'rom all areas 12 millions, leaving a deficit of 5 million tons. Since then disquieting news of drought in India and South Africa has been received and the estimates of quantities w ich the United States of America can export have been revised in an unfavourable direction. In many countries the requirements considered are based upon very low standards of cfiwurnption and the reductions which will be necessary will involve bringing large numbers of people to the point of real hunger if not actual starvation. 2. The situation is further worsened by the grave shortage of rice. 3. The Combined Food Board has made allocations of wheat between , claimants which will mean a sharing of the deficit. This will involve a reduction in United Kingdom imports. It has also been agreed by exporting countries to divert substantial quantities of coarso grains to human feeding. The reduction in imports forthe United Kin dom has nade it necessary to raise the extraction rate for flour here from 80&gt;6 to 85 • -This will mean a large redvetion in off Is available for feeds tuffs, and the diversion of coarse grain to human use will mean a further reduction# W© shall tliersfore have to face a postponement of the return to our normal type of agriculture and consequent losses in livestock products In the future# 4# During the period between now and the Northern Ifenusphure harvests there is little which can now be done to improve the position except by making more available from exporting .countries by reducin'^ consurrption in these countries or improving transport to the ports# This has been taken up appropriately. 5 # During the period after the harvest the situation will, of course, depend pri arily on the size of the crops# Information now available gives no cause for optimism. we have therefore decided to use ever, opportunity to draw attention to the gravity of the situation so as to persuade all countries to sow as much land to cereals as possible# kith this in mind the Foreign Secretary has suggested to his colleagues on the Delegations 01 the Dig Five at the General Assembly of the United Nations that a resolution should be submitted in their joint names calling attention to the gravity of the situation and urging all nations to do their utmost to maloe full use of all supplies available .by proper collection from producers and avoidance: of waste and to increase production as far as possible in 1S&amp;-6* The Delegations have not yet been able to agree upon the text of such a resolution but it seems* likely that one will be taken at the Assembly# dnds# The issue of the above has been dJfly authorised.

I have no comments to offer on your draft letter to Rolls Royce, but I would like to add that I am personally of the opinion that it would be far more satis factory to obtain a R.A.F.

N.C.O. that Air Headquarters, India would communicate with the Air Ministry direct but I feel it would be better to await a reply from Rolls Royce before informing the Air Ministry of the desire to obtain one of their N.C.Os as you might then be able to say Rolls Royce have been approached and are unable to provide anyone.

We have had several letters from Bradley and there can be no doubt but that the conditions under v/hich he has been working have not been entirely satisfactory. Further, a salary of £730 which appears to be the figure which the Afghan Government have in mind would not, I am afraid, be sufficient to attract the right type of person. In the circumstances we feel inclined to av/ait Bradley’s return so that we can discuss the matter with him regarding the conditions of service and perhaps you would be good enough to ascertain from the Afghan' Government whether they would be prepared to pay a salary at least equal to Bradley’s.

'RvC, Plsase refer to my telegram on the subject of Bradley J -- j. now ei ^elegram Ho*24 of the ^,7th Iviarch 1945 -J_ now enclose copies of statements made by King and Bradley regarding the trouble on 1 larch 8th. In V ^view of Bradley * s candid admission of the assault X did not think -&gt;it necessary to go into further details nor into the question wnether there was or was not provocation. The Afghan Air ^orce Commandant did his best to retain Bradley and had he been in Kabul at the time of the affair it is possible that ne might have succeeoea in smoothing things over. it wafa^noweverj the matter was reported direct to our Military Attache and the Afghan Chief of the General Staff and was thus taken out of tne hir idrce Commandant’s hands. The War Minister in full agreement with the Afghan Foreign Office decided that Bradley v^ould have to go. *&gt;e ourselves refrained from attempting to influence their decision and confined ourselves to asking that they should consult us as to the actual conditions on which Braaley should go or remain before they were finally settled. 2. In view of Bradley’s long and excellent service the i-iir Force Commandant is doing what he can to get the best possible terms for Bradley. The Afghan Government contend, and with some reason on their side, that their contract with Bradley does not envisage such a gross breach of discipline as has in lact occupied and that they are not bound to pay him three montns salary in lieu ol notice in the peculiar circumstances of the case, i understand however that they propose to consider him as on leave until April 9th and to give him a grant of £95 as the cost of his passage home. In addition they are allowing him to remain on in Kabul until such time as Bradley can arrange passages home for his family and -,61 orders regarding himself. I presume that this will mean tnat the Afghans will pay the rent of his house until he leaves. These concessions will,I imagine, be contingent on Bradley’s good behaviour; but he has given me his assurance that he will behave himself until he is able to leave. If these concessions are confirmed I do not think that Bradley can have any cause for complaint. 3 * As regards a substitute, I have little to and to the p rticulsrs already given in my &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;*&amp;* ■ telegram, fhe Afghan Government seem to tnink that they will be able to get a substitute from trie Hawker Company on £750 per annum, the pay on which Bradley started in 1937. They have however been warned that they will probably have to pay more than that in view of the general rise in prices everywhere. They much hope that tbd Hawker Company will be able to send a substitute with qualii icaxlcns not inferior to those of Bradley. 7 r I'3fti s ending Top i'es^’oTTlfl^ letter to Caroe a? v/ K.T.Pee1 Gsq•,C.B.B•.C•, India Office, London.to: Colonel Lancaster, Lritish Le^. tion. Herewith the report on the dispute betwpen d/L King and myself* On Tuesday afternoon a' soldier came to the workshop with a paper and asked sultan iv.ohd. to translate from Sngliah to Persian a list of work to be carried out on Ho*3 Aircraft, by the mechanic of i. -'C i uadron• Julian Lohd• refused, and came and asked me if he should do this as it was not his work, 1 took away the paper and read it. j. 'tliat 3/L King had written the list and had given orders to start the work. X then went to the hanger and found it closed out found some mechanics in tne office who said that S/L King had oeen working on No.3 Aircraft. On Wednesday 3/L King and the mechanic were not present. On the Thursday when the mechanic of He.3 aircraft arrived I gave nim orders to open his hanger to see what had been done to his aircraf c-j i xound^ that the tail trimming gear was loose and trie setting wrong, this t- il gearing I had set some weeks before arid had left in working order, as tin is is a very important part I always attend to the setting myself, I was very angry to find that the setting had been altered and asked who had done this, ne said at first he did no know, after ne said that 3/L King had been working there. I started to reset this gearing and than heard the voice of King behind who said the gear was upside down, 1 got my head out of the aircraft and asked him what tne hell was he doing giving order's to mechanics to do repairs without rw tC^ow ledge and why was he inter fering with an aircraft still under workshop control, he replied that he was in charge and would give any orders he wished, I replied, that you a two a penny clerk was telling me how to repair an aeroplane, 1 said get out and mind your own side of the ousiness, he replied who the hell are you talking wo, with this I hit him and then pushed out of the hanger. 1 then left wne hanger and had a walk. . On tne way home 1 meet o/L King and Lr. Pearson and said that if he wanted satisfaction for my striking him I was prepared to take of my coat here oi* anywhere else he did not reply so I said be was a yellow skunk and went home. Last winter 3/L King had no work to do and asked if ne could work in the workshop this I agreed to providing that he did as I wished, this worked fairly well until the i i/x ^ ^‘U a o vn'*n I found -that he was giving orders to do repairs, with result that a radiator was so badly damaged that it had to oe removee. I asked 3/L King not to give orders but to tell me and I would get any work done he wished, and I would know of any repair, done and this would prevent any misunder standing, he agreed to do this, out did not Keep his word for a few weeks later I heard an engine start and found that King was going to fly over the Pagh&amp;m -^ange to have a look at the lakes, this machine had just returned from the south and had not been inspected, so l give the order to stop and on inspection found that the airscrew vvas so loose that had tills machine been flown it would have crashed and King may have been killed. Had 3/L King co-operated when the Tiger Loth was here this aircraft would not have lost its airscrew. He kept it locked up - in the hanger and did the maintenance himself. xie said he was flying over Kabul when he smelt burning so landed had a look around the aircraft, and as he could not find anything wrong took off again, with the result that the airscrew came off, had he sent /for me or lir.Pearson this would have been saved. 1 think this will prove to you that ^/L King has no technical knowledge and is unfit to give orders to repair aircraft, also it is forbidden both in the K.a.F. and civil side for pilots to give any^ orders to mechanics, it must all be done by the person in charge Oj. a workshops. It has been very difficult for me to keep these aircraft serviceable during the seven and half years I nave been here and if is the first time during that period that a flying instructor has ever given an order behind my brCk or refused to cooperate. in Col.

In view of this I suggested to the dquadron Commander that he and 1 had a quick look over the Aircraft that were still here with a view to obtaining some idea of the amount of work that was necessary before we could start flying. this he c_r ed to and asked me to look at aircraft ITo.o first as he hco of the opinion that the Tail Trimming Control Woles v.ere attached the v rong way round. 1 had a look at'the Cables in question and confirmed th t they were incorrectly attached. &gt;e then looked over the remainder of this Aircraft. hilst doing tills I made notes of some of the work still required to be done on this Aircraft before it coulo be flewn. These notes were made for my own information ana future reference. .Tien we came out of the Hangar trie oquadron Commander asked me for £. copy of my notes as an M aid memoir” for himself . I made a copy for him which he handed to an Askar with instructions to take if to Jultan Khan for translation into Persian, do far as I can ascertain, wnilst dultan Kahn was translating the list, hr.Bradley took it away from him. On the morning of the 8th Larch the d qua dr on Comraanaer arid 1 continued looking over the Aircraft. ‘*e had just come out of one of trie hangars wnen an ^skar came up to the Squadron Commander and said tnat Lr.Bradley wished to see him in tr*e hangar where Aircraft Ho.3 was noised. The Squadron Commander asKed me to accompany him wiiich I did. On arrival at the hangar 1 noticed several officers and Askars inside, in all aoout 6 or 7 Afghans. cables. ootn Sc id good q Is y w ci s morning to examining the Tail Trimming Control Lr.Bradley and I, noticing that he as looking at the above mentioned cables, said 'Those cables are upsiae aren't they Bradley?'. At this he swung round and started shouting using obscene language and calling me all the names ne coula think a own at , of, all this in front adding, after a pause remember who you I said are of the Afghans, in which more abuse was speaking to.' This appeared 'Please Braaley, not in here' hurled at me,' and please= me ke him even more enraged and 1 realised that it was impossible to try ana reason with him. I therefore turned to walk out, thereby noping to prevent the regrettable scene from becoming any worse. The next thing that 1 remember was finding myself laying on the floor, in a dazed condition, under the wing of the Aircraft. As I era-led out from under the wing I was vaguely aware that Lr.Bradley was still shouting, using obscene language, saying words to the effect that I was to get out of the hangar and stay out. Hardly had I risen to my feet when Lr. Bradley grabbed me uy the back of my coat and threw me bodily out of the hangar on to the gravel outside where l landed on my hands and knees. By this time it was perfectly obvious to me that 1 could not remain and at the same cont ining my feelings any longer, so I left tne scene to continue my work. Later Lr. Pearson and I were walking home to lunch when Hr.Bradley overtook mat us. mowing that he was behina us, I had already warned Lr .Pearson not to say anything if :.r.Bradley again accosted me. Lr. Bradley began shooting at me, in the same manner as before, and ordered me to take my coat off and nave it out with him 'cnere ana then by the siae of the roaa, in spite of tne fact that there were other Afghans on the road in our vicinity. Throughout this harranguing I refrained from answering and after a Anil?, whai. Lr.Br dley appeared to have exhausted his vocabulary, he ceased shouting at me and walked on ahead. On reacning Lsjor Fox's house I stopped to make a telephone call to Captain Pettigrew on some other business, wnen I noticed an ^ir Force Officer with four Askars following us. informed me tnat, to use his own words, ,r He had learea ioi’ my saiewy- su he had collected 4 skars and a further incident occurred On interrogation, this officer ,'Ke had feared for my safety' so followed us home with a view to intervening had ( also mentioned that he had brought his revolver!)

Hr. Bradley of Hawker*s Ltd. has been working in Kabul for the last 8 years supervising^jthe maintenance of Afghan Air Force^j^^w He was under contract with the Afghan Government. The Pilot Instructor of the Afghan Air Force is a Squadron Leader King, R.A.F., who was seconded by the Air Ministry to Afghanistan for the purpose. He also is working under contract with the Afghan Government. From accounts that have come to hand privately, it appears that Mr. Bradley is a rather difficult person to work with and that Squadron Leader King is a rather ineffectual personality. Recently a quarrel broke out between these two in one of the Afghan Mr Force hangars in the course of which Mr. Bradley struck Squadron Leader King a blow which rendered him unconscious. The Afghan Government regard Bradley*s assault as a gross breach of discipline and have decided to dismiss him. The contract provides for three months notice or pay in lieu thereof being given in the event of/ (10308) Wt.l3671/P.159 1,000 5/39 A.A E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 (10854) Wt.l8826/P.221/2 3,000 (2 sorts) 6/39of the contract being terminated* It is not clear whether the Afghan Government are prepared to recognise the validity of this particular provision in the circumstances, but the point has been brought to the notice of H.M. Minister, and Mr. Squire can be relied upon to do his utmost to ensure that Mr. Bradley gets as favourable conditions as possible. As the accounts enclosed with Mr. Squire’s letter of the 6 th April below will show, the incident cannot have enhanced British prestige in Kabul and from our point of viev/ it is perhaps as well that the Afghans have decided to dismiss Bradley. The situation has been explained to Hawker Aircraft Ltd. and they have been asked to provide a substitute for Mr. Bradley. They have undertaken to invite applications from their staff for the post, and they have also asked us to let them have a full report of the incident in due course. The enclosures to Mr. Squire’s letter below seem to constitute as full a report as we are likely to get, but perhaps it would be as well to refrain from passing it on to Hawker’s for the present because Mr. Squire has already been asked by telegram to let us have something specially for Hawker’s, and that it may be tiiat he would prefer them not to see his lett er and its enclosures. 1 , Ui 1 It would probably take some time for a substitute for Bradley to reach Kabul from this country, and so the Government of India have been asked to endeavour to produce a temporary replacement for the meantime. f tr /k\ rffr - /Of H/CC- ^ C&lt;- ^ ^ Cw-0 “ ^ &lt;T ^ f J ^ &lt;- a^_J- ft ^ /y_ L ^ ^ 'il’ )t&gt;- ^ T»1 ILE r- y h. \ \) vx r? 1301 IHYfARB TiSLE&amp;Ri ,M SECRET 13687 ^Allot ted , to Extern a l Department . ^ QPiei Circulated- CYPHER TELEGRAM (0&gt;T&gt;F^ ) Government of India, External Affairs Department, AIa C/a*» From To k.M.

We would be very grateful if you could use your best endeavours to expedite the Journey as much as possible. Yifith regard to Bradley’s contract it is noted that he is entitled to three month’s notice of termination or salary in lieu thereof and we should be grateful if you could, through the British Minister, ensure that Bradley’s interests in this connection are safeguarded.At the same time we should like to have a written report from the Minister regarding the circumstances of his dismissal # pending receipt ^ of which, we, as a Company, would naturally prefer to keep an open mind as to the merits of the case. The pirectors of this Company have asked me to express their regret at Bradley f s dismissal and have asked me .to put. on record the exceptional consistently good behaviour and service of Bradley throughout the eight years in which he has been engaged .in Afghanistan. No doubt you will pass on such comments regarding this as you think fit, to the Afghan Government. . . . We shall be glad to know ■whether or not, a replacement will be required and await to hear further from you in this connection in' due course.Kxt, l6U3/h5 » 7th April, 19i+5* D*ar Mr. Lidbuiy, In continuation of ray letter of the 5th April, about Mr. Bradley, I write to say that v/e have now received a telegram from the Government of India in which they state that they are experiencing great difficulty in finding a suitable tenporary substitute for Bradley as the rigger trade is reported to be almost obsolete in the Royal Air Force. They recounend therefore that a replacement for Bradley should be sent out with the least possible delay. The Afghan Government are also anxious to receive &amp; permanent replacement as soon as possible. As you no doubt know, we attach considerable importance to this poet being filled by a British engineer, eo Wfe hope therefore that you will do your best to meet their wishes. The Government of India also ask for early instructions as to Bradley himself, and they add that if he is to return hone, a high priority would be necessary to secure passages for himself and his family. /e should be grateful therefore for a very early reply to ray letter of the 5th April, in order that we may telegraph to India and Kabul.

My demi-official No.45/46/A to Caroe of March 9th (copy sent to Peel (?March 17th)). 2. AfghTTn Government have decided to dispense with Bradley’s services immediately for having assaulted Squadron Leader King while on duty. Exact terms still under consideration but I understand t-hat Afghan Government will pay Bradley only until actual date of departure not yet fixed but probably about April 8th and will also in view of his long service pay cost of passage home. They have asked for permanent replacement from England as soon as possible but if as is probable this will entail delay they would like temporary substitute from India urgently. I hope this will be possible until we arrange as this unfortunate occurrence is no fault of Afghan Government* 3. I should be glad of early orders regarding Bradley. His outbreak was indirect result of having remained too long in Afghanistan and 1 recommend that he should be sent home if possible. Presumably Hawkers will be consulted about this. If not required in England I suppose he will be liable for conscription in India. Dated Kabul 15.30 hours 28th March 1945 Received 19.45 hours 28th March 1945.

Personal* &lt;3 British Legation, 17th Larch 1945* I am enclosing a copy of a letter I wrote last week to Caroe about an unfortunate row between King and Bradley. You will probably have received a telegram about it before you get this letter. It looks as if the Afghans will try and dismiss Bradley without compensation, hatever p-^jvay one looks at it it is a most unfortunate affair* Hunter has now heard that Goodwin should be arriving any day. I telegraphed to you about him because hunter has recently had a heart attack, fortunately not very severe, and the Doctor wants to get him away as soon as possible. V/e brought him over to the Legation and he has* been in bed here for a fortnight,but is now being alleged to get up again and potter about. It will make it very awkward for him-trying to hand over without overdoing it. 3. I had a very nice letter from Crichton the otner day. I have heard that he has been to meet you all and to see something of Kabul affairs from your end. i hope there will be no hitch about his getting a passage back. He himself suggested that I should give you cur definite dates in case there should be any hitch. We should like to leave not later than June 20th so as to get home before the childrens* holidays begin at the end of July. This should just be possible' if Crichton gets back punctually at the end of his six months. 4. dverytiiing s 33 ms to ce going on peacefully here.

Dear Caroe, I am sorry to have to report a serious fracas which took the Pilot Instructor en here too long and ^— —... . ^ ry aim cult to v/ork with. He resents having to v;ork uncier the orders the rilot In&amp;tructor who is a younger and less experienced person than himself and there have S 11 along been difficulties between him and King. King has probably not handled the situation very well and has been reluctant to assert •himself. Yesterday however there was a difference of opinion in the workshops regarding some repair work and Braaley lost his |temper, abused King publicly and knocked nim out. he tnen took him (up ana flung him out of the v/orkshops. subsequently both of them came to the Legation to report their versions of the inciaent to I the military Attache. Lancaster reportea at once to the Chi ef oi General ataff who on Lancaster's aovice has suspended Bradley |from duty, pending full investigation. 2. we don’t quite know what line the Afghans will take over this unfortunate affair. Bradley has been with them for many years and in spite of his hasty temper they fully appreciate his worth. &lt;e of course can do no less than recommend Bradley's immediate dismissal, awkward as it may be. (The Afghan Government can give him 3 months pay in lieu of notice.) Lancaster will see the Chief of General Jtaff tomorrow, if possible, but it is unlikely that orders will be passed until the C.G.o. has been able to see the V/ar Minister and tne Air korce Commandant, both of whom are at the moment in Jalalabad. L* If, as seems inevitable, Bradley has to go it is obviously better that he should go as soonas possible, beveral points will then require consideration:- (i) That temporary help can we give to the Afghans? Tney are sure towant somebody and would probably be willing to have an Air Force Jorgeant, a qualified fitter rigger, experienced in Hawker-Hind aircraft, if such a person can possibly be found. It may be that the R.A.r . would be willing to spare a B category man. (ii) What permanent arrangements should be made to replace Bradley? I suppose Hawkers would like to send someoody, if they can do so, with a view to post-war developments. This question can however wait for the moment, though we shall of course have to report what has happened as soon as a decision has been taken here. (iii) The problem of what to do with Bradley. This will I suppose be rather a problem for India to decide, ne still be in Hawkers employ and will presumably be required by them in England in which case he should, I suppose be shipped home as soon as possible. Mrs. Bradley and the two children were in any case intending to leave, for home very shortly and I think they have already applied for passages. If they have not already got them • 4. I will send you a telegraphic import as soon as we have been able to reach any decision after consultation with the Afghan Government. To what extent King was to blame and whether we should get rid of him too will be matters that will have to be considered when we have got fuller reports. Even if he is not seriously to blame he will have inevitably lost face with the «eghan Government and it may not be possible for him to stay on either. Jo have not been very satisfied with the way that he has handled the supply of spare parts nor with the lack of keenness that he has displayed in his work generally, txiough he is popular with t he Afghans and seems to know' his Job.

Mr. Bradley has not yet accepted this offer, but it is possible that he will do so. The Chief of the General Staff stated that they fully appreciated the services which Lfr. Bradley has rendered, and is rendering to the Air Force, and it was for this reason that they were prepared to offer him a new contract on slightly better terms.

Dear Sir, I understand from Mr. Bradley, who is stationed in Kabul, Afghanistan, that he has been asked by the Royal Afghan Government to renew his contract for a further period of two years as from the 18th of February, 1944, subject to the consent of this Company. I also understand that Mr. Bradley’s salary is increased by £100 p.a. as from the date of the new contract. I should be very glad if you would kindly confirm the above information and no doubt application will be made to this Company for their consent as above. Yours faithfully, For and on behalf of HAW \ ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO BEy A’oivx y ] IMDIii OFFICE, \ WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.N.1. Ext. 296/bU , Will you please refer to Kabul Memo No. 464/^-3 dated 4th November, regarding Mr. H. Pearson’s expenditure from his arrival at Bombay until he reached Afghanistan. We hope that the Government of India have felt able to accept the Legation’s recommendation that they should find some of the money involved, if it is a fact that Mr. Pearson had to wait in Bombay for 13 days before getting instructions about his journey from there to Kabul, As sta.ted in Rumbold’s D.O. letter to Curtis, No. Ext. 3021/43 of the 17th June, we told Pearson before he left this country to report to the Embarkation Officer on arrival in India, whether he landed at Bombay or Karachi, in order to get these instructions and it is unfortunate if none were waiting for him when he arrived at Bombay in August, I do not think that we could have done more than we did at this end. Rumbold’s letter to Curtis of the 17th June was sent by fast air mail and was followed up by our telegram of the 3th July No. 14335. We should be glad to know whether you think that we could have given clearer instructions to Mr. Pearson or better information about Ms movements, to your Department or to Kabul.

During this period salary at the hate of £ 750/- per' annum is payable to Mr. Pearson under clause 1 of the Agreement anted 28th April 1943 made between him and the Governmeht of India and, as will be seen from the remark under condition 1 in the letter dated 1st February 1943(Ext.606/43) from Messrs Bolls Boyce to the India office, This salary is intended to cover board end lodging during the journey to and from Afghanistan. ordinarily therefore Mr. Pearson should himself pay his notel bills at Bombay and Peshawar. The circumstances of his stay were not, however, ordinary in either* ^ place. b 4. In Bombay, as directed before leaving ijrigland, he reported on arrival to the Embarkation officer. That' officer knew nothing about him ana eventually after three days * waiting arranged for him to call at the Civil Secretariat. Nothing was of course known at the Secretariat but it occurred to the second person whom Mr. Pearson interviewed there to advise him to go to the Afghan Consulate. Having reached the Afghan Consulate the Consul had no instructions for him and could not give him a visa, accordingly a telegram had to be sent to Kabul for the orders of the Afghan Government and a reply awaited. The result of .-11 this was that Mr. Pearson had to spend thirteen days in a hotel in Bomomy through no wish of his own and at a cost altogether disproportionate to his salary, before he could leave for Peshawar on 27th aigust. * 5. His misfortunes did not end there. ,derived in Peshawar on 29th August he had a bad attack of malaria, was unable to coiiie up to Kabul on the Legation lorry leaving Peshawar on 31st August as was intended, and had to remain there until the Legation lorry next left on 7th Beptember, thus spending, again against his will, nine days in a hotel. 6. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Minister feels that in spite of the position stated in paragraph 3 above Mr. Pearson ■, should be given a subvention towards his hotel bills auping his enforced stays in Bombay and Peshawar. He suggests that this ..light be at the rate of As. 10/- per diem, - i.e. Bs.22Q/- for the twenty-two days involved - and he hopes that the Government of India will be prepared to find this sum of Bs.220/-. 7 p • i. • v.( 2 ) ?• xhe remaining item in paragraph 2 above is in respect of train fare# Under Clause 9 A of Mi'* Pearson's contract with the Afghan Grovernmpnt the Afghan Government are responsible for the payment of a second class fare between Bombay and Peshawar, ana second class travel is prescribed in clause 5 of his contract with the Govern ment of India which - unlike his contract with the Afgtetn Govern^ ment - he had seen and signed before he left *jigland, although he did not bring a copy with him - cf.paragraph 3 of inaia Office letter no*ijjct*2250/43 dated 4th May 1943 to Messrs Rolls *\oyy*— The . sum of Rs.167/-, shown in paragraph 2 above, represents, how cr, a first class fare from Bombay to Peshawar. Mr* Pearson explains that on the troopship in which he travelled he had been proviaed with a first-class berth although there was also secona-class accommodation; on arrival theref ore in a strange country where conditions of travel were unknown to him he assumed that, on the analogy of what Government had arranged for him in the ship, he was entitled to travel first-class by train. It is clear the t the fghan Government c&lt;n only be ^sked to pay the second-class fare between Peshawar and 3ombay(cind also between the United kingdom and India though this is not yet in issue)* The secona-class fare is presumably Rs.83/8/-. His Majesty's Minister recommends that . in the circumstances explained the balance of Rs*83/8/- be paid by the Government of India and not by Mr*Pearson* | 8. If the above recommendations are accepted, out of the sum of Rs.1500/- advanced Rs*83/8 will be recovered from the f ghan Government, Rs*1113/- will be recovered from Mr. Pearson and the I balance of Rs.303/8/- will be found by the Government of India* His Majesty's Minister will also be grateful if the recovery to be made from Mr. Pearson can be by very easy instalments. 9* If the Government of India should be inclined to think that the \ recommendations in this’ letter are unduly favourable to tr*Pearson, Kis Majesty's Minister would like to emphasise the importance which he attaches to employees of the type of Mr* Pearson being contented and not being given the occasion to harbour a grievance, real or imagined, against either the British Government or the f*ghan Government. If they are discontented anu labour uhaerasenae of ^grievance, they are unlikely to give good service to the ,*fghan Government or to conduct themselves in the manner in which for obvious reasons it is desirable that each member of the small ritiah community here should conduct himself* \?

Extract from Report on the Afghan Air Force for the period 1st May to the 31st July^ 1943 o (e) Maintenance (ii) There have been a few cases of engine failure during the quarter due to the absence of a British mechanic instructor, and the carelessness of Afghan personnel in regard to the care and maintenance of engines. Mr. Robinson, Messrs. Rolls Royce mechanic instructor, left Kabul in March and his relief, Mr. H. Pearson, has not yet arrived from England. In order to ensure that aircraft engines are kept in good order, supervision of the workshops by a British mechanic appears essential.Ext.57UA3. 0 &gt; A.

Sr* r u 1 'JCLOSURE IN AIR MML' LETTER 10 . 34 2 OCT 1043 tOM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT,, INDIA OFFICE 4 2. It is very desirable if at all possible, that Mrs .Pearson, the wife of Mr .H.Pearson, a mechanic of Rolls-Royce , who is already in Kabul as Engineer-Instruetor to the Afghan Air Force, should travel, together with her boy of eight years, on the same ship as Mrs. King.2 . In the normal way, if Mrs .Pearson were proceeding to India to join her husband there, she would co;;.e under the ordinary procedure with regard to women travelling to India, and would, if permission were granted, have to wait for her turn on the High Ccmmissioner’s list of people awaiting passages. Her case is, however, different from these, and exactly parallel to that of Mrs.King. The satisfactory staffing of posts of British Instructors to the Afghan Air Force has a direct bearing on the relations of H.M.G. with the Afghan Government, and is of considerable political importance. It has been found that if these posts are to be properly filled, it is essential, owing to the conditions obtaining in Afghanistan, that the British staff should take their families with them or that the latter should follow with the minimum of delay. In the cases of both Mr .Pearson and Squadron-leader King, it was necessary to ask them to travel without their families, on the understanding that they would be allowed to follow as early as possible /andand there is no ground for discrimination between the two families. There is moreover an arduous journey to Kabul from the Indian port of disembark ation, which it is most desirable that the two ladles should undertake in compai^y. 4* In these circumstances Mr.Amery very much hopes that it will be possible to accommodate Mrs. Pearson and her child on the same ship as Mrs.King, or in a ship travelling at about the same time. I am to add that the matter is urgent, as Mrs. Pearson has not yet been informed of the possibility of so early a departure.

It seems from Mrs. Pearson^ letter attached below that her husband had expected her to be on her way by now (we had certainly not encouraged him to think this in view of the shipping position), and had only left her £25 ,which by now has meltea away. It is unlikely that Pearson has a banking account here into which he could pay money for Mrs. Pearson, and I suggest that as she seems to be in urgent need, we should advance her the sum of £20 to be recovered through the Government of India. A draft telegram to Kabul is attached which might issue when we near that the A.G. Department have sent the sum of money.

A, f.J 4- In anticipation that his wife and child would accompany him Pearson disposed of his home in England. As he is going on a troopship they cannot accompany him, and in order to cover their expenses until he can provide for them out of his earnings in Afghanistan, he asked for an advance of salary*. On the analogy of technicians recruited for ordnance factories in India, who are granted in exceptional cases up to two months' salary in advance before sailing, we have advanced him a total sum of £120 which will-be debited -to you in the Inward Account Current with the Accountant-General, Central Revenues under the Head 'Miscellaneous Items Adjustable in India'. Nevertheless, it is possible that Pearson may arrive in India without much in his pocket if he has drawn the bulk of our ad'vance to meet domestic expenses here.

It has now been definitely settled that Mr. Pearson will sail about the middle of this montfc without his wife and child. Mr. Pearson has already been given an advance of salary of £60 and he now asks for a further advance of £120 on the plea that when he thought that he could take his family with him he broke up his home and the decision to leave them behind involves him in certain immediate expenditure. The practice of India House in regard to mechanics recruited for the G-overnment of India is t&lt; give them an advance of one month’s salary and in very special cases two months’ salary. They never give more in view of the danger of the men getting into debt at the outset of their employment in India. Mr. Pearson is unlikely to be more than two months en route and it is therefore submitted that he may be given a further advance of £ 60 , which would mean that he would get a total advance equivalent to just under two months’ salary. \S\ CcocwC&lt;x&gt;~t'. v'A one. v€v«. cW^v&lt;. t \ cvafit® ^v\ri&gt;v- ewe 6ac“v«. c^0L^vo e \ evafit* g M 19 ^ a u&gt;U.ve ^ Vo v. cev^o^ w «Tv\V IcSX i u. c'V^O'Ar’ c. u&gt;ctve ^ Vo v. c c\r*y+\ w &amp;e \ \ reV\e t: K v ) f ^ I NWARD TELEGRAM I 1R (If in any case the communication bf the contents of this document to any person outpide 1943 , k *^js^a 2 Txrjient Service is authorised s , ) part,,* araeei) - Allotted to. g-xteenal Dep t&gt; Copies to Foreign Offi gH» CVPHE1R TSLEGRAM From His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul To Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs India Office.

We naturally sympathise with your preferanc* that your wife and child should aooompai^r you on the journey, hut I fear that it is quite impossible to put any women or children on the ship due to sail shortly. Moreover I understand that the possibility of aooorauodation for women and children becoming , available in the near future is remote and consequently I rather doubt whether there is anything much to be gained by postponement of your own departure in the hope that something more convenient will turn up. 2. As Messrs. Rolls Royce will have told you, your agreement with the Afghan G-ovenxoent has now been squared and it is desirable that you should reach Kabul as soon as possible. I understand that there is likely to be another passage available for yourself alone in about a month* s time, and if, in view of the fact that you have disposed of your home, you need more time to make arrangements for your family to remain in this country than acceptance of the present opportunity would allow, we would agree to your waiting for the second opportunity. But we think it necessary that you should not delay your sailing longer than that. In the meantime there may be &amp; boat announced which will take women and children, but as I have said I think that this possibility is extremely remote. 3. I shall be glad if you will wire your decision as soon as y'jx, receive this letter.If in the light of the above, wliioh I aia eending by letter as it is difficult to explain it all by telegram, you decide after all to accept the present opportunity, we shall need to know by midday on Friday the 7th.

I daresay I shall find Lord Lytton T s r marks somewhere among the papers you have sent me. as 1 knew it two years ago but I don f t suppose it has much changed I think the best reply to the Pearson*s question is to be found in the fact that Urs Bradley - wife of the senior aircraftsman in Kabul - joined Bradley there,'ith h^r child aged eighteen months,and has been there ever since,ie some 5 years. Mrs B is a first class person,a good organiser,runs a good house,and is completely au fait with Kabul conditions. Conditions are hard of course,the houses not very comfortable,and the servants most inefficient. But if Mrs Pearson were to get into touch with Mrs Bradley,as seen as she arrive^ in India I am quite sure that Mrs B will see her through the awkward month or two when the Pearsons first arrive and everything is strange and uncomfortable. I do not think there is likely to be any difficulty about getting food for the child,milk,eggs and so on,but I expect that prices have risen considerably there as elsewhere. Robinson^ house,which was ^ bachelor quarter,and they may not get one at first which is very suitable. But I suggest that you should wire to the Begat ion,as soon as the date of Pearson*s departure is known,asking them to arrange for suitable accomodation for a married man. It might in fact be as well to find out before the Pearsons leave,if you have not already done so,that the Afghani are agreabie to having a married man with his wife and child,in ;Robinson*s place. They will probably have no objection but if Pearson were to turn up without warning and complete with family ithey might jib at giving him, better accomodation than they did to [his predecessor.

Rumlj^ld . iq+b V/ith reference to Katodon 48 of 18th Larchit has 'been suggested that the Afghan Government are not in a position to hack out of the contract engaging Lr. Pearson^ as they agreed to engage British personnel when they bought the eight Hawker Hinds in 1937. I have looked up the papers but have found nothing which gives us concrete grounds for such an assumption. It appears that we were approached in the first place by the Afghan Government regarding the possibility of obtaining British instructors. O ££basons for wishing to get the Afghans to employ British personnel for training pilots on the Hinds are given in the minutes on P.Z.3010/ 37. I’he Foreign Office had already asked for the Afghan Government’s decision 'in principle” to engage British instructors ( paragraph 3 of their letter to the Afghan Linister of 27th April 1937 P.Z.2881/37). From later telegrams it appears that H.L. Minister obtained the Afghan Government’s agreement in writing to the acceptance of four British instructors at a total pay of £3,125 sterling per annum. (Katodon 57 of 27.6.37 and 66 of 16th July 1937 P.Z.4176 and 4664/37). We do not appear to have received a copy of the Afghan Government’s written agreement. The extraordinary thing is that no period of employment appears to have been specified - it may have been overlooked owing to the sudden need to speed up negotiations due to rumours that the Afghans might buy Italian or German machines. The first contracts were drawn up for one year at a time with provision for increased salary should the contract be renev/ed. Up to now the contracts have been renewed regularly although it would seem from my research that the Afghan Government is not actually bound to continue doing so. The final transaction on the sale of the aircraft was comnleted A last year. ^ c. 'fX.e. \€aCVT 'A.viV S\5\&lt;C^CL\ruk U C.

Rolls Royce Ltd., for the loan to the Afghan Government of the, services of a mechanic to replace Mr .Robinson who, with Rolls Royce's permission is joining the Indian Army, are now nearing completion and the following brief account will put you au fait with the circumstancest 2. Rolls Royce nominated Pearson, an aero-mechanic in their employ,aged 27* to succeed Robinson who, for the last 5 years, has acted as an aero-mechanic to the Afghan Air Force. Pearson came to see us last November to be told a little of the conditions of life in Kabul and what he would be expected to do there. He appeared to be quite suitable'? Owing to delay in Kabul where Sir Francis ’Wylie has been trying to negotiate a contract with the Afghan Government on a similar basis to that of Robinson, a considerable time has elapsed and there will now be some hiatus between Robinson's departure and Pearson's arrival. Robinson left Kabul at the end of his contract in February and there is, as yet, no passage available for Pearson. 3* Robinson was originally engaged at a salary of £550 per annum for the first year, which rose to £750 iu the second and subsequent years of his service in Kabul. Pearson, however, has stood out for £750 from the commencement of his service • This had led to more delay as Sir Francis Wylie has been unable to obtain the Afghan Government's consent to pay more than £550 per annum to him. We have now obtained the Government of India's agreement to subsidise Pearson's salary up to £750. They have also consented to pay him the full salary of £750 from the date he leaves the United Kingdom until the conmence- ment of his contract, and from the date he leaves Kabul until he arrives in this country. This is customary in the case of ^techni cians recruited for war service with the Government of India. In their case, however, they go out for the duration of the war, whereas it was d^^r^in Pearson's case that, since his contract with the Afghan Government was negotiated for a year only he could decide to return home at the end of that period, having been a large liability to the Governnent of India over a short space of time. We therefore decided to make the payments conditional on certain reasonable undertakings , and to embody the terms of the payments to him by the Goveriment of India in an agreement /between2 between himself and the Governor-General of India in Council* The agreement will be entirely separate from his contract with the Afghan Government which latter .sttr is now concluded ujr , I . :• 'i. r-.i : ' 30*; •' :li _ ■ , ' 4* At a fairly recent date Pearson decided that he wished to take his wife and - child with him and we are now waiting to hear from India whether they will pay the passages out (technicians going out to India have free passages for their wife and family^) * The Afghan Government have consented to pay Pearson's passage both out and home* We supported Pearson's application for exit permits for his wife and child ; on account of social conditions in Kabul and the fact that their presence there might lead to his greater contentment with the job and a desire to renew it if the Afghan Government offer him a further contract. I under stand that exit permits are net granted until the security people have vetted the applicants. As the Pearson family have now obtained exit permits, I am told that we can assume that they have been vetted. It is hoped that Pearson will come before a Medical Board on the l6th. X-Kf ’ C. x .)

As regards the conditions referred to in your letter, our comments are as follows : 1. A (X) b Salar y. We must press for payment of Mr.Pearson f s Salary at the rate I of £750 per annum from the date of his embarkation from the United Kingdom to the date of his return to the United Kingdom. • ■e cannot agree that the Salary will not cover his return journey. In the event of Mr.Pearson leaving for Kabul before the agreement is signed and the Afghan Government refusing to sign it. Salary at the rate referred to should be paid by the Afghan Government or by the Government of India from the date Mr.Pearson leaves the United Kingdom to the date of his return. Under present conditions the journey to Kabul and back might take several months to complete and it would be unreasonable to suggest to Mr.Pearson that he should forego his Salary in these circumstances. 2• Method o f payment.

It is customary when our Engineers are sent ^ where special clothing is necessary, to make them an outfit allowance of £25 which we consider is reasonable. Mr.Pearson is not prepared to waive this condition but in order ^ £ jj to facilitate a settlement we agree the amount should be reduced 11 to £15.

Rolls Royce, Derby. 3 Since writing to you the other dayMr* Beel ^ • - /IpA 1-, r ‘ We have been negotiatdjw for the replacement at Kabul of . _r. Robinson by^'Sio'S’iier Aero Engine Mechanic nominated by Messrs. Rolls Royce* Discussions have throughout proceeded on the basis that his - wwk cxkkcqcKt would be similar to that of Mr. Robinson, but the Government of India have agreed to make up his salary to £750 p. a, instead of the £550 p. a. at which Mr. Robinson started and which the Afghans are ready to pay to Mr. Pearson. The Government of India are also ready to provide Mr* Pearson with a passage out to India and to pay him -ft- salary during his voyage, moreover, if he sails before his contract is signed and the Afghans refuse to have him, they are ready to stand whatever financial commitments this may involve. They have been very generous. Meanwhile, the Afghans are being dilatory in the conclusion of the contract, although the only outstanding point is whether they should provide a passage out. for Mr. Pearson. This does not matter because the Government of India will pay if they don’t. I suspect that the Afghans may be thinking of getting hold of an American instead. We have now received the somewhat astonishing letter, dated the 1st Pebruary, from Messrs. Rolls Royce, which suggests an alteration in the whole basis of the arrangements^Although technicians are in present circumstances able to blackmail prospective employers, I think we should take a very firm line even if it involves breakdown in the negotiations and a draft is attached. The only point on which some further concession might be considered, in the last resort, would be something in respect of salary for Mr. Pearson during his homeward journey.—B%('. bobj/fi DRAW LETTER Messrs. Rolls Royce Ltd. , Linton Lodge, / Linton, Wetherby, Yorks. Gentlemen, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to reply to your letter No.B. l.b./6/HS of 1st February regarding the proposed employment of Mr. Pearson in Afghanistan^^ All previous discussion^ on this subject have proceeded on the basis that ivlr. Pearson* s contract would be similar It will be seen that Mr. Robinson’s contract, a copy of which was sent to Mr. Oliver with my letter No.Ext.2^896/42 of 10th September, 1942, was between the Afghan Government and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Pearson’s contract will be in the sane form. There deee-not ooarn-to have been in Mr. Robinson’s case any separate and parallel agreement between c°py to to that of Mr. Robinson, ^ would appear from your Company’s letter of 2nd November, 1942, No o TB/RD0.15/JO that you welcomed this arrangement. v himself/himself and the Secretary of State for Foreign Vu's Affairs or the Government of India^ ^ RoMnoon^e- counter signature of his contract appooro te have regarded as sufficient assurance that he would implement the obligations which had been assumed in his name, while he himself doubtless felt that he could rely on the diplomatic protection of His Majesty’s rdnister in regard to the terms of his contract ^ as in wider matters ^without any formal 4s i?. however, Mr. Pearson agreement on the subject &lt; desires something more formal, the India Office would be ready to complete on behalf of the Government of India an agreement^ either with your Company on behalf of Mr. Pearson or with Mr. Pearson himself jWhich would provide: - (a) lull at the Government of India would pay to Mr. Pearson salary at the rate of £750 p* a* from the date of his embarkation from the U.K* to the date when payment to him of ff salary by the Afghan Government begins. (b) that the Government of India would thereafter pay to Mr. Pearson salary at the rate of£200 p. a. during the currency of his contract with the Afghan Government* (c) Iftiat the Government of India -would provide Mr. Pearson with a second class * passage from the U.K. to an Indian ^&gt;rt and reasonable travelling expenses between that jyort and Kabul. * (d) fhat Mr. Pearson would undertake to assume the obligations provided for in the agreement rogarding his-e.uplu.ymejnt between the Afghan Government and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. If, as was suggested in my letter No 0 Ext.35S/^3 of 20th January to Mr. Oliver, Mr. Pearson sails before his contract with the Afghan Government is dpfibaefcfcesfcgf signed, the above agreement would also have to contain a provision providing that in the event of the Afghan Government eventually refusing to sign it, the Government of -^ndia would provide Mr. Pearson with a return passage^ to the U.K* As regards the main contract with the Afghan Government, it would be most undesirable to introduce/introduce any new points at this st^ge. To attempt to do so would probably result in the ,Ov\&amp;a€a.Q. Goo'- breakdovm of negotiationsybr at least the . - . . * indefinite postponement of a conclusion^^T^ t he various ,points which you mention in your letter^ ^ome are already covered by Mr. Robinson* s ©vviidw cc^KCKfiA^f^V^^SiCVr contractq^v ) -^4riQir hy tiraynaw under negotiation at Kabul on behalf of s jr» Pearsoi^while others are intended to be covered by the high salary of £750 p* a. to which the Government of India have agreed without question, although it is substantially more than that paid to technicians employed by them in India on comparable duties. S, As regards the six points which you raise:- (l) It has already been agreed that Mr. Pearson will receive total salary at .the rate of £750 p. a. This salary will be paid from the date of his embarkation from the U.K. until the end of the currency of his . contract. It will not cover his return journey. Free unfurnished quarters or an allowance in lieu will be provided by/( 4 )/ 0 by the Afghan Government (vide Clause 12 of Mr. Robinson^ contract). (2) Half the-salary due from the Afghan Government (i.e. £275 P* a. ) will be paid in Afghanistan in Afghan currency converted at the Peshawar rate of exchange, and the balance of £275 p. a.' due from the Afghan Government will be paid by them in sterling to H.M. Legation^ Kabul^on behalf of Hr. Pearson (vide Clause 8 of Mr. Robinson* s contract). It will be open to I'.lr. Pearson to make what arrangonents he wishes with the Legation for the remittance of the £275 paid to than in sterling and ’ regarding the method of payment to him of the £200 p. a. due from the Government of India. (3) The Government of India have agreed to pay the cost of Mr. Pearson* s journey to Kabul and the Afghan Government would, under Clause’9 of Mr. Robinson* s contract, provide a second class fare for the return journey 1 from Kabulto the U.K. The miscellaneous 1 items to which you refer are intended to be covered by Mr. Pearson* s salary.(4) This is already provided for in Clause 10 of lir. Robinson 1 s contract* (5) There is no provision in Mr. Robinson* s contract for an outfit allowance. t This is intended to be covered by Mr. Pearson* s salary* (6) The currency of the agreement will be 12 months^ as yo u sugges t^ in the first instance/(vide Clause 6 of Mr* Robinson* s ^ Cb contract) and^will be terminable at three months’ notice by either side (vide Clause 13 of Mr* Robinson*s contract). lo. The India Office are in consultation with the Passport Office regarding an exit permit for Mrs, Pearson and her child. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Pearson* s decision on this point seems wise* and the application will receive the support of the India Office. Enquiries are also being made regarding the availability of a passage for Mrs* Pearson and her child#PfrlK. d_0P£ Ext«606 /4-3 v India Office, Whitehall, London, S.V/.l 4•^ , Pebruar:; , 1943 lS)u» Ma. 4 )^, We have nov' received Messrs. Rolls Roycc's letter dated 1st February., reference B 1b/6/HS , of which you spoke to me on the telephone recently, and I see that Pearson now vdshes to take his wife and child with him to Afghanistan. 2. The situation has changed considerably since I told you that it might be possible to get a passage for Mrs. Pearson, as there is new an embargo on passages for women and children going East. We are however prepared to take up the question of obtanning exit permits and passages for her and her child, and I suggest that for this purpose you send us as early as possible the necessary passport application forms duly completed together with photographs. 3 . In view of the embargo on women passengers there are not many ships going East with accommodation for them.
