I have made enquiries from the Military Secretary who informs me that Her Excellency is due to arrive at Bahrain on June the 15th at approximately 9-30 A#M. and will depart again as soon as the aeroplane is refuelled. This operation usually takes about three-quarters of an hour, but you will probably know that better than I do. If you could meet Her Excellency on arrival and do anything that you can for her comfort during her short stay at Bahrain it would be very much appreciated. Yours sincerely, The Hon f ble Lt. Col. G.

She saw the sights and left for Basrah 09.30 hears. -LOCH- /On the 15th June 1933 Her Excellency Lady Willingdon passed through Bahrain by Imperial Airways. I went to meet her at the aerodrome and in the interval of refuelling took her for a short trip in the launch and showed her the general lay out of Muharraq, and Man amah and the Agency^ There was, howeveronly time to see things from the distance and we returned through the Muharraq bazaar. Taxis were used but had I known that Her Excellency was likely to wish to see sights I would have borrowed Shaikh Muhammad's car, 2. Mr.Gould of the Political Department was travelling Home at the same time. Her Excellency was accompanied by an A.D.C. (plight-Lieutenant.Macdonald) and a Maid. There were two other travellers whose names I did not ascertain. 4. Her Excellency was relieved to find no one at the aerodrome. Fortunately owing to the death of Shaikh Ibrahim,it was not possible for the Shaikh or his Family to be present. I had mentioned the me/tter to Mr.Belgrave (Adviser) and we decided as they were in mourning we would say nothing about Her Excellency's journey. 5, Her Excellency told me that the Residency Agent and the Head Munshi had met her at Sharjah and that the Shaikh had shown them horse iiacing and other diversions. He had presented her with a black pearl (much to her disgust) for which she is arranging for the Toshakhana to send a suital‘ present. Should another journey of this nature take place,it might be well to give a hint at Sharjah that such presents are not acceptable. In view of the vogue for sleeveless frocks I let Her Excellency know privately before hand that they are looked upon with disfavour by old fashioned Arabs. beer, 3.

The object being to fly to Pasrah via th^ Refinery and ooint out to His Excellency the outstanding features thereof, ^or T understand that H.S. actually visited the Refinery in 1918 and is anxious to take this opportunity of seeing what it looks like today. I an afraid to utilise the Imperial Airways’ east-bound service in orde^ to make this connection, as the margin of time is so narrow that any delay would cause me to miss this appointment. I have therefore decided to Proceed to Bahrein on board one of our tugs and will arrive there either at sunset on the 16th of May or at daylight on the 17 th. You will appreciate, I am sure, how important it is for me to have confirmation of the date on which the Viceroy will arrive at Bahrein or any alteration thereof. Cur tugs verv busily employed, and I wish therefore to shorten the period of the tugs absence from Abadan as much as I possibly can. I have never visited Bahrein before and would much have liked to have taken this opportunity to have paid a proper visit, but unfortunately I am just about to proceed on leave and my time is there fore much occupied.

My dear Fowle, As you are no doubt aware His Excellency Lord 9illingdon on his way home was given presents by the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Bahrain but not by the Shaikh of Kuwait. His Excellency has written to the Military Secretary to the Viceroy asking that his iramed photo graphs may be sent from here to the Shaixhs of Sharjah and Bahrain and Kuwait and has also asked for the advxce of this Department as to return presents which he might suitably give to the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Bahrain on his way out. I imagine that you will agree that it would be suitable for Lord Willingdon to make return presents in the manner suggested and the only question remaining is what presents would be suitable. regard ing this you arebest qualified to advise ana 1 will be grateful if you would let me know as soon as possible what presents you would consider appropriate so that I may let the Military Secretary know and he can then arrange for Lord Willingdon to purchase them in London before he leaves.
