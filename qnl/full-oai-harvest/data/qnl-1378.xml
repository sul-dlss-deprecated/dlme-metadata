The ultimatum stated that should the Shaikh in question not wish to give his concession to PCL, he would not be permitted to negotiate with or grant a concession to, any other company. The ultimatum was issued to the Shaikh’s of Sharjah, Ras al Khaimah and Umm al Qaiwain.Further correspondence relates to PCL’s interest in exploring the territory west of the Oman mountain range and the subsequent discussion regarding which rulers claimed responsibility over the territory, whether they had actual authority there or whether it was in the hands of local shaikhs, and how PCL should approach exploring there in those circumstances.The correspondence includes a detailed assessment by the Political Agent at Bahrain, Tom Hickinbotham, of the areas in question and outlines what he knows of the areas of the tribes that claimed ownership including the Beni Kitab [Beni Qitab] (also given as Beni Chittab); Naim [Āl Na‘īm], Bu Shamis [Āl Bū Shāmis] and Duroor [Al-Durur] as well as outlining where he believed the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and Sultan of Muscat’s areas of authority to be. The correspondence concludes by recommending that the Company be persuaded to delay their explorations into this territory until the following year in order to permit the Political Agent and Residency Agent to spend the winter visiting and exploring these areas in order to ascertain a more accurate knowledge of the situation.Other matters discussed in the volume include:an invitation from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to Petroleum Concessions Limited to open concession negotiations with him and the company’s wish for Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanoo to accompany their negotiator (Basil Henry Lermitte) to Abu Dhabi;copy of the Debai [Dubai] Commercial agreement (folios 53-70) signed by Major Frank Holmes (PCL), Tom Hickinbotham (Political Agent at Bahrain) and Shaikh Saʻīd bin Maktūm Āl Maktūm (Shaikh of Dubai).the Political Agreement for the Trucial states which both the India Office and Petroleum Concessions Limited wished to amend, and subsequent negotiations to achieve this. A copy of the redrafted agreement can be found at folios 103-109.a visit by Frank Holmes to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah (Shaikh Sulṭān bin Sālim Āl Qasimī) for the purpose of opening concession negotiations, which was unsuccessful, and concerns that the Shaikh would attempt to negotiate with the Standard Oil Company despite being informed by the British Government that such negotiations would not be permitted.Petroleum Concessions Limited’s intention to employ Haji ‘Abdullah Williamson to work for them in the Persian Gulf as his employment with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had ended and their concern that they would not be able to do so owing to the circular issued by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf preventing Williamson from visiting the Arab Coast. Also included is discussion of the decision by the India Office and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to make the company aware of the evidence they had in support of Williamson’s actions on the Trucial Coast in which he was seen to be working against the interest of his employers (PCL) and of the Shaikh of Dubai.Correspondence with the Trucial Coast Shaikhs is in English and Arabic; letters from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company contain Persian and English letterheads.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 191-196.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>William Richard Williamson</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Sharjah</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geographical exploration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028b#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
