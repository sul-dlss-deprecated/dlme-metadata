File No. 22/5. X X X X X X X X X i 2. The second point of interest is that His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and I have been talking about price - control of standard foodstuffs. The rough idea is to issu price lists every week or ten days for things such as rice, flour, sugar, meat, etc. (as is done in magy big towns in India, and I believe in parts of the Hear East), and the municipalities are to be ^sponsible for the preparat ion of these lists. The main object is to prevent profit eering such as occurred last September. I wirl let you know how this idea progresses. XXX X X X X X Xxhe .Residency, lb f r cCcaa. Uould you please refer to paragraph 2 of your demi-official letter iMO.Ci/249, dated 15th April 1939• (v \ 1 o 2* ihe idea in itself is, I think, a good one but there are various repercussions and complica- -tions to be considered in so far as it affects per- -sons under our jurisdiction, especially British Indian traders, who deal largely in the necessities of life. The Bahrain Government can 1 presume in one way or another influence, or if necessary enforce, their subjects to submit to a price control. It will be more difficult for us, however to do this v/ith persons under our jurisdiction. I suggest therefore that you and the Bahrain Government consider this aspect very carefully, and 1 would like to be informed before any action is taken. 3* in case of war v/e could, if necessary, issue an order under the defence regulations, but this would not naturally be possible in peace time. H. v/eightman, Rsquire, Political Agent, BahrainConfidential n D.O. No* C/297 Dated the 4th May 1939. Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No* 376-S dated the 21st April 1939 ? 2. I should not anticipate any extreme difficulty in inducing foreign traderSf including British Indian traders in ■lahrain^ to adhere to the price lists which it is pro &gt;osed to issue in Manama and Muharraq. There would of course be no question of fixing prices at rates so low that ordinary trading becomes impossible, and consequently I should anticipate that if foreign traders attempted to s ell to the public at rates higher than those published in the price lists the immediate result would be that they would lose their custom to competitors of Bahraini nationality. There are of course many ways in which, in case of need, pressure can be brought to tear on foreign traders to accede to the price lists before it becomes necessary to apply judicial procedure. 3. In point of fact, so far as Indian shop-keepers in iv-anama municipal area are concerned legislation does exist in King s Hegulation No. 1 of 1921 to which we could have recourse if necessary That King’s Regulation might be amended, if we find any serious opposition on the part of foreign traders to the price lists, in order to make it applicable to 'all persons to whom the Bahrain Order-in-Council applies' and also to make it valid in Muharraq Municipality in addition to ! anama. 4/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel ; | i Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, . j : f ' ' r v Bushire.&lt;s .2* 4. My own opinion, however, is that the force of public opinion, i.e. the fact that the public will buy from traders who sell foodstuffs at published prices, will be sufficient; and at any rate I would recommend that we should see if this is not so before we actually engage in amending legislation. 5. With reference to paragraph 3 of your letter. In the event of war we should want to control not only prices but supplies themselves in order to prevent food-hoarding or excessive sales to the mainland. I am not quite sure which part of the draft Defence Regulation would cover such an order, and I should be grateful for advice on this point so that a draft can be prepared in advance for use if and when the necessity arises.

In so far as the control of prices of standard food stuffs in peace time is concerned see my demi-official letter Ro.492-S, dated the 12th May 1939. 3. In so far as the control of prices in war time is concerned, provided that the Bahraini merchants can get adequate supplies, the same argument applies as given in my letter quoted above, i.e, that purchasers will naturally seek the cheapest sellers. 4. Supplies however may not be adequate either (a) on account of restrictions in exporting countries (b) on account of excessive re-export from Bahrain to the mainland. 5. (a) we could not control. (b) could be controlled by the Bahrain government and ourselves imposing restrictions on export# iThe political Resident will have powers under Article 2 of the draft Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in council to make any Regulations required, vide paragraph 2 of my JSxpress better jmo. 323-3, dated the 8th April 1939.)

Briefly, we can deal with hoarding but not with scarcity.H xHe Kesidency, ■Bushire, tne 12th May» 1939* /sV 1 , Could you please refer to your demi-official letter jno. C/29T of the 4th Pray 1939 on the subject of controlling prices of standard foodstuffs. 2. What I do not understand is whether it is the intention to wait until a crisis arises, such as in last September, to issue the price lists, or whether it is the intention to issue them now as a normal routine peace time measure, lln this connection see paragraph 6 of my letter jao.49l-S of the 12th May.) 3. The lists issued in Indian towns, which you quote, are, I believe, not compulsory ones, but merely a sort of general guide, but I gather from your letter that the Bahrain price list will be compulsory. Is this so ? 4 . On principle I am against legislation if it can be avoided and whatever attitude the Bahrain Government take up I do not think that there is any necessity to impose control on the people under our jurisdiction, British Indians and others, since, as you point out, if foreign traders sell at higher rates than Bahrainis they will of course lose their custom to the latter. 5. Please let me have a list of the standard foodstuffs over which control is contemplated. With regard to your paragraph 5, this is a different question, which I am replying to separately.

The question then arises whether there are sufficient stocks of essential foodstuffs in the Trucial Coast towns to enable the population to carry on without fresh supplies by steamships. 2. I should be glad to have your opinion about the length of time which stocks of foodstuffs in, say, Sharjah and Dubai would last without replenishment. I should also be glad to know if I am right in thinking that not only Sharjah and Dubai but places like Abu Dhabi and Has al Bhaimah receive consider able quantities of wheat, and rice by country dhow, and if so whether it would not be possible for supplies for the whole Trucial Coast to be imported by dhows. 3. If stocks are small and if imports by dhows are likely to be insufficient, we shall then have to consider whether we should not advise the various Shaikhs to arrange with their main merchants to retain permanent stocks of essential food stuffs sufficient for three months or more. I do not however want you to speak to any of the Shaikhs about this until you have sent me a reply to this letter and I give you further instructions.

Belgrave infor^ me that no action was taken by the Bahrain Government xfre maintain stocks of essential foodstuffs for use if supply were reduced by war. 3. He is of the opinion that it would not be possible to estimate how long stocks in Bahrain would last from figures available in the Customs Office. It would be possible to arrive at a figure for average monthly import for local consumption but until local consumption is known it vrould not be oossible to estimate the surplus held by merchants. 4. I think it is quite possible to arrive at a workable figure by local enquiry. I have talked to some of the bigger merchants who deal in rice, flour and sugar and these men seem to have a very shrewki knowledge of the capacity of the local market and in stocks and sales of their rivals. Dhamanmal Isardas estimates that stocks of rice and flour would last between to 2 months. These stocks of course vary from month to month especially at the beginning and end of the Pearl season when huge imports of rice are made. The bigger merchants are still keeping in bigger stocks than usual in view of the possibility of war. 5. Live stock are imported mainly by local craft from Persia and there is a plentiful supply of dates this season. H. Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain, (on recess), C/o Postmaster.

The Political Agent, Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. Dear Sir, We have received advice from a merchant in Bahrain f who is one of our very good clients,that the Bahrain Govern ment has recently issued a proclamation forbidding merchants from increasing their prices as a result of the War, in con sequence of which this particular merchant, in common with many others in Bahrain who are also the clients of our Asso ciated Company in New York, Dayton, Price &amp; Co.Ltd., will either he unable to take up their shipments now arriving, or will have to sell their goods at a loss amounting to approx imately 50^. f\ This situation is caused by the appreciation of the Dollar in relation to the Bupee, the rate for retiring drafts now quoted by the Eastern Bank Ltd., being approximately 360 as opposed to the recent rate of approximately 290. It is quite possible that the merchant who sent us this advice has only given us half the story, but, in the event of this supposition not being correct, we wish to re quest you to re-consider the present ruling, so that our clients who import goods direct from America through Dayton, Price &amp; Co.Ltd. are not put to a loss by reason of the un fortunate increased cost to them when retiring their drafts on New York. May we request you to advise us the exact situation, as you will no doubt understand that we a^e very interested both from our own point of view and tiat^Hhe Bahrain merchants with whom we do business?

BaJirain, 2nd November 1939. To, H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain* Sir We beg to enclose herein a copy of the letter written by us to the Pood Control Officer, G-overnment of Bahrain, for your information. Representatives, General Stores Trade*I \ \ Bahrain, 2nd November 1939* So* The Food Control Officer, Government of Bahrain, BAHRAIN . Sir, We have to thank you for the opportunity you afforded us to discuss and come to a mutual understanding regarding the Government’s proposed control of the selling prices of various commodities connected with our trade* In our interviews we tried our best to explain to you the difficulties that would be met with in trying to control the prices in retail trade of General Stores line, and we endeavoured to make quite clear the innumerable difficulties particularly with regard to the changing of prices of our existing stock from prewar prices to bring them to the level of the percentages of profit fixed by the Government* It will $ he practically impossible to do this without terrible detriment to the trade and it will mean the stoppage of all our business for at least three months, if not more* We do not wish to take up aS your time in trying to express all these difficulties here once again, and even if we do so, w© are sure we will not be able to explain it so explicitly as we could do in a personal interview* We are very unfortunate in not having been able to explain clearly our difficulties as a result of which we are pained to see that the Government has arrived at a decision without considering all these points* However, as the Political Agent has kindly allowed us a second chance, we give below our suggestions which were arrived at after thorough discussions agongst all the members of the trade of our line and trust that the Government will reconsider the whole matter in rj a new light* We wish to assure you that we fully appreciate the Governments anxieties to check profiteering on the part of merchants during these abnormal times and we ourselves are very anxious and willing to co-operate with the Government and carry out their behests in this direction*- It. we may be permitted to dispose of our existing stock at prewar prices* 2a- Goods received hereafter may be sold at the percentages fixed by Government, but the prime cost over which the percentages are to be fixed, will differ in our line of trade, as you are aware that ours is a retail trade and we have to keep a very large staff, efficient and highly paid salesmen, attractive shows in our stores* Over fS# of our sales are on credit which compels us to keep heavy accounts and the percentage of bad debts are also much higher compared to other trades* Moreover, there is much breakage, leakage, evaporation etc* Precious and costly fabrics, both woollen and silk, get spoilt by the damp and hot climate of Bahrain* Ravages wrought by rats and moths and variousCopy forwarded to Political Agent, Bahrain. 2 \ v (® various other losses make it absolutely essential that while marking out our cost price f we should add at least 15^ over and above the actual landed cost of the goods in our store and then regard this as • • our crime cost , If the Government wants us to bring the prices of our existing stock to the percentages passed by the Government and not allow us to sell at prewar prices ( which we wish to assure you have always been very reasonable and moderate&gt; because it could not be otherwise as Bahrain had always free trade and owing to keen competition the prices always remained at a very reasonable and low rate, specially so with all articles of daily use. ) We wish to draw the Governments kind attention to the following difficulties.— a) We will immediately have to stop selling all #iose goods which come under the control price regulation, as we will have to start working out prices from our old invoices, perhaps of several years back, and find out the new selling prices and get all the prices re—written on each article, which procedure will take at least four months. This is no exaggeration. The difficulties in this can only be realised if the actual process is observed* b) Bresh goods will be arriving and there being no sales made,receipts will very much depreciate and we will not be able to clear drafts from the Bank and other innumerable difficulties will arise which will make our trade a standstill* c) In the remarking of prices etc., our whole staff or a major portion, will be employed for that work so that all sales and other work will be stopped. d) If the Government does not agree to the method of calculating prime cost for the trade of our line as we have suggested, we are afraid that in various lines such as provisions, footwear etc., we will be compelled to cancel all our orders as no merchant would like to do futftre business with sure prospects of suffering heavy loss. Thanking you, We are,* Sir, Representatives, General Stores Trade.r Bahrain, 1st. November 59 The Controlled of Foodstuff Bahrain. Sir: &lt;/»e, the Merchants of woods and Building requirements have the honour to draw your Jtind attention to the question of Building requirements imported to us from Europe and the diffic ulties of reaching this side in the present circumstances, for instance ilia White vi/ood which price has increased enourmoulsy in Europe and we understand that for the past two weeks the increase is about 50^ if not more during these few days in addition to the increase of freight and the insurance and according to this increase which does not sUits the Bahrain market for the reason that mostof the works have been stopped and secondly that the merchants here cannot follow the outside markets in obedience to the Government orders, as the Eurpean goods and specially those of this kind are impossible to import to Bahrain and what is said about the white wood is said about the Iron too, as the increase in the latter is about 100^ and specially in India as it is impossible to export iron ana other materials from India, this is if we say that the merchants is prepared to pay the difference of the freight. As for importing such goods from Europe are impossible and tnis means th&amp;t if jshadt the Government does not consider this matter in accordance with the present circumstances, weskhailx shall not loose the profits which the merchants gain during the war in these material only, but we losse nearly the profits whicch gained by the merchants during a course of one year , and that is due to impossiblity of importing the ggods continuiously as has beeu done m p±e\/ious ucxiices. Most of our customers with have willingly to kyy buy some materials fromm us in accordance with present circumstances in connection with the outside market but we could not accept such offers in obedience from Europe as far the goods imported from India, like Teak-Wood etc. if we accept that the profit should be 15 ^ we would ask a margin of 10 ^. to be added on the actual value which is shown on origianl bills and this for the reason that most of measures and specially that of 4'and the damages Some times amounts to one fourth of the whole goods ana we are prepared to show that damages to the Government which lies in our Hana: goaowns, wmcn .^e concern ourselves lucney enougn -co sell sucn uamage material ac its nail origianl price All these remarks are according £o the meetin, held at the Manama Balaaia on 31/10/39 which we request the g ove- nment to consider these matters in accordance will the merchants benifits. ^ h' ^ Your faithfully■ MMBahrain,2nd November 1939. THE CONTROLLER OF FOODSTUFFS, BAHRAIN. Sir, Re Gontrolof Hardware &amp; Haberdashery . We beg respectfully to submit that our dealings are chief ly in Hardware and Haberdashery. So far the latter is concerned it covers, so to say, a thousand and one things and ?/e shall be’ grateful to know which articles of which prices are sought to be controlled. As regards Hardware, we import this chiefly from Bom bay. The prices vary there daily-and depend on demand and sup ply as there is no control nor is there anywhere else in India or abroad. The largest manufacturers in India, Messrs. Tata Steel Co. have already circularised of great increase in prices. Hardware has to be constantly imported to replenish stock of sold out items. No two invoices will disclose same prices. Our Stores are full with things, some of which have been on hand for years. When new stock arrives it is merged in the old and it is not possible to distinguish thereafter one from the other. For an instance, locks costing, say, Rs.20/- per dozen before will now cost, say, Rs.30/-per doz. If our profit is restricted to 25$ unconditionally, the very same locks, if from old stock but brand new and bright, will have to be sold at Rs.25/-per doz. while from newly imported lot at Rs.37/8 per doz.! 'When it is remembered that such things have been imported, say, a hundred times and always with some difference in prices, it Yv T ill be seen what a mess will result in fixing 25$ profit on same things bought at different times! It is a well-established fact that hardware gets rusty in Bahrain in no time. Such goods cannot be disposed of unless at less than cost price. The heavy deficit thus caused has to be recouped from stuff in good and bright condition. Bahrain being comparatively a small place and the sale of hardware is necessarily restricted, and as there are tfelfe- ral dealers in the line, it is respectfully submitted that 25$ limit is quite inadequate to meet the cost of such a large establishment as ours. The result of the control, if confirmed, will be that the public will readily buy the best things by paying us the price inclusive of 25$ profit and thousands of rupees worth of other stock will become unsaleable unless at less than cost price. So this even 25$ margin will be more than swallowed up by the rusty and non-essential materials. In this connection we are prepared to produce our books to show what a limited amount of business in this line is being made and unless our profits on the average are enough to meet our all expenses with a reasonable margin for the heavy capital outlay involved it will be simply impossible to continue sr the business for an indefinite period. v/e also stock a limited number of electric goods, most ly bulbs and bakelite fittings. Bulbs have to be sold after testing and at least 25$ of these and fittings become unfit for use when put to tests. Under these circumstances, we respectfully appeal to you not to be guided by theories but take practical view so that the views of Government and merchants may be reconciled and the2 . c latter may not 'be ruined to the disadvantage of both. Me would assure your honour that we are fully prepared to co-operate with Government provided fairness and justice is assured. n v/e beg to remain, M-,(&lt;•; 1 Bahrain 2nd November 1939 * Jlr v The Controller of Foodstuffs Bahrain . Sir Sub.iect Iron . With reference to the ebove we beg to bring the following facts for your kind consideration. T That the prices of various sizes Vary * at the time of purchasing from factory an average price is quoted on receipt of our indent hence the invoice will show average rate . 2 That our sales have been always here on varying retes according to different qualities , 3 That if there is a little defect or the iron turns out to be s-eur then hardly half the prices are realized by us • ^ 4 That the present percentage of 2o^ falls short in certain cases on our actual sales even in pre wardays . Sn consideration of above facts if one rate is fixed for all qualities it will be to our great disadvantage so some selected qualities will be in demand whose rates are isbstly higher &amp; in others we shall have to suffer heavily . Hoping the above facts will be considered before final decision , Thanking you in anticipation .Bahrain, 1st November 1939. The Pood Control Officer, BAHRAIN . Sir, As per your kind suggestion, we are enclosing herein a letter addressed to H. B. M*s Political Agent, requesting him to grant us a personal interview in connection with the recent proposed control of prices by the Government of Bahrain, Thanking you for your kind offer to forward the letter on our behalf, Yours faithfully,Bahrain,31st October 1939. To,' H. B. M'S POLITICAL AG-EHT, BAHRAIN. Sir, We, the representatives of the General Stores Trade beg to inform you that as a result of a meeting held by the order of the Government of Bahrain, requested Food Control Officer that we may be granted personal interview by your honour. We find so many difficulties in our v/ay in com plying with the Bahrain Government's latest control of the prices of General Stores, that we are compelled to make the above request from your honour. Hoping to receive your kind permission for an inter view, We are, Sir, Yolits obediently,GtSI'TBRAIj STORES. It would be advisable that goods stocked by CTeneral ■Stores are not brought under control basis because their trade consists of innumerable lines where 'percentage Ox proxit in every line vary even,in varieties of the same line aifferoy andi also prime cost of the same article very often diffeis with the different merchant. There are so many other innumerable difficulties in arriving at a standard measure oi tte percentage of profit with varying scales for the different varieties of articles, that it would be impossible i. or merchants to carry out correctly control percentage fixed by the Govt, and at tie same time it will be verjr difficult for the Govt, to check that their orders are carried out. heen copetition among merchahts, slackness in trade owing to the war and natural consequences of supply and demand will always tend to have the pilces maintained at the noimal level. Every merchant is anxious to retain good deal of his customers and to have continuous repeat business y/ith his clientele and he will not venture to jeopardise his present and future permanent business by raising his prices exhorbitantly for the sake of a temporary petty gain. However, if Govt thinks it advisable, a few articles of prime necessities which may by Clearly defined, such as tinned provisions, Kolynos tooth paste, Prophylatic tooth brude Ten; tooth brushes Bryloream and selling prices for Govt from time to time committee of merchants Govt. Gold flake cigarettes Players Cigarettes s Bavy cut tobacco GLette blades these articles may be fixed up by the after consultation with a representative of that particular trade appointed by the/ ll/ GEMSRAI^STCeSS, n If Govt, wishes to have percentage of profit fixed up • for the different lines- which seems to us heweve^e will prove very cumbersome and difficult in practice— we suggest the following practical methods for the Govt's kind consideration a) All the existing stock of the merchants (General Stores' may be permitted to be sold by them at their current selling rates which should be not more than 25$ of the prewar rates b) For all fresh goods received hereafter merchants may be ordered to charge the same percentage of profit on their goods (ofcourse the prcentage will differ according to the variety og good) that taey have been charging in prewar days, c) Whenever any merchant receives fresh goods and if the cost comes dearer or cheaper than previously then he should be allowed to raise or decrease the price of similar goods in stock and if other merchants deal ing in that line wihh to bring their prices on the same level they may be allowed to do so ^ h) If Govt does not approve of close (b) then the nett percentage ox profit to be made by a merchant may be fixed up by the Govt over and above the prime cost,For merchandise of the general stores prime cost will be vjorked out as under InvoiceNralue plus lauding charges local customs charges^lus stores establishment ienses ® 20 $ Invoice value Landing charges and customs expenses Stores establishment expenses ( 20$ ) We suggest that the nett profit up to the following percentage may be permitted, Provisions 25$ Stationery 25$ Hosiery 33 1/3 Electric goods 33 1/3$ Leather goods 33 1/3$ Toilet requisites 33 1/3$ Patent medicines 25$ Utensils etc. 25$ e) The above r/ules should apply to importers and not to retail dealers ^sdaisxshiaiilstxhasExfxssxhaHdxxiixxailxiigxxiiKix6 fxnw The main point upon which I oil ter Swr*h the Representatives of the General Stores is in their wording out of the prime cost. Their method of working out the Prime cost appears to be as follows:- a) Invoice price; b) Customs duty, Import Yard Charges, Landing Charges, and cartage; c) 20^ Stores Establishment expenses. In regard to tc* I entirely disagree with the Representatives of the General Stores in aaoing 20f under the heading of ’Stores Establishment Expenses’ in working out their prime cost, as such expenses can never be aoaed to Prime cost, but as a matter '^of fact, these expenses should be deducted from profit. Mr. Ashraf, when questioned as t out of the prime cos cause General Stores other similar stores cost. While it may Expenses to their ^r stores are limited c h-olU'ers- d raw s al a r i e may Be adding 20$ St cost, but in the cas quite different, the one of the Representatives of the General Stores o why such an item was incluaed in the wording t he gave me to understand that it was done be like Messrs Whiteawys, Army &amp; Navy Stores and ado such an item in working out their prime be true that the above named stores, aod Stores ime cast, it should be remembered that those oneerns, and as such their Managers s every month, and for thise purpose ax one they ores Establishment expenses to the their prime e of General Stores in Banrain,. the case is stores here being unlimited concerns. In view of the facts stated above, the agoing of 20$ Stores Establishment expenses on the prime cost is not at all justified. My way of working out prime cost is as follows:- In case of commodities paying 5$ Customs duty, add 12^$ to invoice value; in case of commodities paying 10$ Customs duty, aod 15$ to invoice value, and in the case of commodities paying 15$ Customs duty add 22^$ to invoice value, as for example:- prime Say, one case tinned provisions which pays 5$ duty, the cost would be: Invoice value: Customs outy 5$: I.Y.

Now taking the figure of daily cash and credit sales to be Rs:500/-, if the prime cost is worked out according to the suggest ion of the General Stores Representatives, that is by adding 20$ to the prime cost, their NET profit would be: Rst3,4oo/ According to my way of working out the prime cost, the profit would be: Rs:1,800/ There is now a difference of net profit of Rs:l,600/- per month. per month (35ff) M H Rs:1 00/- Rs: T5.0.0 ' 2.00 « 1 . 8.0 » 1 . 0.0 ' 0.4.0 « 2 . 8 . 0 _ s * 'Si'S . 4 * 0 Now the question of the method of working out the prime cost is entirely left to the discretion of the Government.General stores ^\o x f'O J Since the prices oi articles other than ol aaily use are not ^oing to be controlled, the lining up oi prices will not at all be cumbersome, as these stores always have list of rpices fixed* a) Yes this may be allowed on prices prevalent before the 10th of Rajab, as since they have raised their prices c onsic erably* b) Yes; this is reasonable. c) There would be no objection tothis being cone. d ) Yes; but do not agree with the adding up of 20$ Stores Establishment expenses being added to the prime cost, as this would leave them a margin of profit oi 35 $ net whi ch is exorbitant*vi ?

Your letter dated 20th December 1939 has been passed to me by the Food Controller. The sugar in question was consigned to Bahrain not for Jubail therefore the statement of the person who wished to export it from Bahrain would appear to be incorrect.Copy of letter dated 20th December 1939 from Messrs.

For your kind information, we beg to send you herewith a translated copy of the letter we received from the Amir of Hassa concerning 251 bags of sugar which was imported by Ahmed almujil for Jubail. The owner has wired to His Majesty The King that the Government of Bahrein refused to grant him a permit for shipping the same to Tubail, As the Amit of Hassa has asked us to put this matter into consideration with you, will you kindly explain to us the reason for which the Government did not permit the above sugar to be shipped to the main land.Copy of Translation of the letter received from the Amir of Hassa to Messrs. AlGosaibi dated 2/11/58. After greetings 'fie ^ have received a telegram from His Majesty The King stating that Hamad almujil has wired to H.Majesty saying that he imported 251 bags sugar from Java for Jubail through Bahrein and the'Government of Bahrein did not permit the goods to be shipped to our country. Moreover, he pretends that the Bahrein Government carried the sugar from the transit shed after it has been officially acknowledged, and they intend to distribute it on the merchants at the half cost price. Therefore, -we would ask you to investigate the matter and let us know the reality as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, Baud bin Jalawgr.Telegram From 'Q'. Political Agent, Bahrain.

Enel....G h (n) Copy of letter dated 15th January 1940 from the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. In reference to attached correspondence (returned herewith), the phrase in Clause 2. 'so-called option expired at least two days before the arrival of the ship at Bahrain” is not understood. 2. There has never been an option, or a so-called option, which expires two days before a steamer f s arrival. A 3. No doubt it will be recalled by reference to previous correspondence, that in A.D.1921, the RE system was instituted, by which goods intended for certain mainland ports, and premarked RE should pass through Bahrain on pre-payment of 2$ a.v. I Enclose herewith a copy of the original order relating to this arrangement. 4. The Optional system 1 was instituted on 1st Ramadhan 1349., A.H. for the purpose of encouraging mainland trade through Bahrain; and the Bahrain importer, was permitted to exercise an option as to whether he re-exported his goods to certain mainland ports, or sold them in Bahrain. I enclose a copy of the ahlan, which sanctioned this. Hv-W 5. The reason for my present enquiry is thht, at present, in view of war conditions and local profiteering, especially in piece goods, I suggest that the option to re-export should not lie with the merchant, but be exercided by the Eood-and-Price Controller in the interests of the people of Bahrain State; and I fear that the wording of the Order under Regulation 2. does^allow such authority to this official. No doubt H.B.M’s Political Agent would consider this point, and clear up any doubt that may exist, please.TRUE COPY CUSTOMHOUSE BAHRAIN D/ 20th April,1921 Notice The under-noted merchants at Bahrein are hereby informed, that under fresh orders from H .E ♦ SheilUi Sir Isa bin Ali El- Khalifa K.C.I.E.

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 29th January, I'HO. To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN / ( I emorandum . /VJ Heference your confidenti: 1 memorandum No.2321/3 Dtated the 27th January 1940 in regard to optional cargo. 2 . I must reaffirm in the first place that I was informed, when the question of food control was in the early stages of discussion, that merchants were required to exercise their option two days before actual cargoes arrived in Behrain. This however is a matter of little interest. 3. The situation no is that in accordance with the Order which I have made under Regulation 2 issued by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the export of all foodstuffs from Bahrain by oersons subject to the Bahrain Order in Council - i.e., foreigners - is totally orohibited except under a special permit issued by the Rood-Controller. The only cargoes exempted are those consigned from source for transhipment from or reexport through Bahrain to neighbouring countries. 4. It was, I think, understood that the Bahrain Government would is ue a similar order in resoect of rersons of Bahrain nationality. If this has been done then the n Alan of the first Ramadhan 1349 is modified to the extent stated in this order — that is to say that no merchant is permitted to exercise the option unless he has the prior permission of the Food Controller.2 - 5. This I think covers the qufery raised by the Director of Customs* who may be advised that the exemption from pro hibition on reexport relates only to goods which have been definitely marked for reexport from the time when they left their port of origin* i.e. to the merchandise affected by the Bahrain Government’s Alan of the 20th April 1921.

Hoping to be excused for the trouble* * \ ^ w * ^ / * a ^ ,# 5 't 0 '] Baiirain,2nd March 1940 @ H #B .M 1 s Political Agent Bahrain , ftespeeded Sir, Re the present procedure of Control of food stuffs , 1 * At the very outset we would bring to your Honour’s attention that the system of prices under control is never objected to,but the procedure,as being adopted,is detrimental not only to traded,but to the very object for which the control system has been put into practice, 2, It may not be out of place to mention that the controller being unaware of mercantile intricacies he has been misguided and every effort is being made to avoid his direct contact with the merchants and possibly he himself may not be aware of the real mis chief that is being created, 3, We would request that Your Honour would be pleased to give due attention to the following paras wherein a clear conpiracy of giving indirect monopoly of ffiod stuffs to one merchant at the cost of manor portion of merchants and thus. 11 )robbing the merchants of their legitmate share in the trade ( 2 )robbing the general public (3) deceiving the Government ,have been clearly proved,If full investigat ion is made into the matter by impartial inquiry the abov e fact^ along wiffii the criminal breac h of tr ust of a Government, servant ,in discharge of his public duties,would undoubtedly be proved to the full satisfication, 4, Inorder to remove misunderstanding which be created from interested quarters to prejudice the real cause,and having cautiously and very patiently watched the present procedure for about six months we now ventuer to approach Your Honour with a humble request that the present procedure is being woiked in the least interests of one merc hant and every effort is beihg made to help his cause at the cost of other merchants,who are mostly British subjects,and this has led to indirect monopoly to the said merchant;in support of it we give below a few examples, (1) Just after the declaration of mi war the monopolized merchant, hereafter to be called the favourite party,imported about 16000 bags of Rangoon rice,along with the rice of the Bahrain Government,as there^was expectation of either restriction on exports or difficulty in transport,but both expectations proved failure and on the contrarycontrary rates at Rangoon began to fall down,and it mx was clear to each and every merchant that this decline in rates was only for a short time,hence all the merchants were to import large quantities of cheaper rice which made the favourite party to fear that if the cheaper rice were imported the rates of the same could not be raised, at this place,by the Bahrain Government for a considerablly long time and thus they would have to suffer lossesX* In order to help him them all the merchants were asked on 8 th November 1939,by verbal order, to stop import of Rangoon rice,which holds good tillkate,on misguiding the authorities for Government rice disposal* Had no restriction been imposed on the import of Rangoon rice superior and cheaper rice would have been imported which would have benefitted the consumers by keeping the rates down. This was done specially to see that the rates increased shortly as the stock at that time was very limited. Besides more than 2000 bags have been imported,by the favourite party,of the quality which js jam not fit for human consumption which remains a mystery . (2) At the very start the official rate of Sugandhi rice was declared at Rs 9-8-0 per a bag.According to standing procedure unless the rates are publicly declared no merchant is allowed to sell on higher rates and though imports of large quantity of this commodity were made by the favourite party yet upto this time no rate has been declared other than the one at the very start. On 8 th November 1939 it*s import was prohibited (though Government rice did not contain a single bag of this quality)and hence no one could import the same. The previous stocks of the merchants had nearly been consumed by this time and only the said party had a large stock imported by them in their last consignmerufai: of 16000 bags which they did not sell on those rates thus they by this act enjoyed a clear monopoly and had no fear of new imports by any one and - went on increasing the rates without any government notification and the latest to the best of our knowledge is about Rs 11—8—. per a bag or more,* If the Government had Fixed the rate of this commodity,according to practice,the said favourite party would never have been able to get such high rates and this was the root cause for not announcing the rate. Besidesx that^retail selling price of this commodity has not been fixed upto this day hence as they increase the rate the retailers too increase their rates without any hinderance thus the consumers have to pay more.3 ^ ^ (3) The rice imported by the said favourite party,on Bahrain Governmenl account,are very inferior which never meet the approval of the consumers and those in know were fully aware that if other merchants were to import the rice of the usual quality no one would purchase the government rice till that stock was consumed and in order to conceal this fact from the authorities tactics were adopted and merchants were stopped to import so that the said Government rice couldk be sold out,thus by the prohibit ion of imports their both the objects,viz( 1 )concealing the fact of inferiority of rice imported on Governments account(2Jgetting good price for their rice, were achieved .Besides that the Government rice are under weight i.e.weigh less than that fixed by Government and only a small percentage therein is of full weight.How Government accepted the same is a mystery and about 15000 bags frm* Government rice are still lying in the Import Yard Shed thus it would be easy to ascertain. When the merchants who had purchased rice from Government complained about the weight they were told that they should not fear as no complaint regarding the weight of those rice would be heard thus the Government orders about the weight were being trampled anff general public getting short weight. (4) A meeting for disposal of Government rice was convened by the Controller on 19th December 1939 wherein he had shown his intention of fixing new rates of Rangoon rice but 2 or 3 days prior to that the said favourite party sold freely large stocks of those rice on the condition that they would charge them the rate which was to be fixed by the Government very shortly,±hEnifc|| though the rice were imported by them * more than two months prior to that date when they did not sell on the then p revailing rates,it is a mystery how did they come to know 2 or 3 -——'&gt;■ days prior to that date that the rates were to be raised very shortly and thus sell on that condition *at the time when others came to^about the sales they had sold out large stocks.Had the secret not been revealed to them they could not have been able to sell while others were unaware. Besides that according to the Government ordersmax no one has a right to sell anything on the rate other than the one prevailing on that day. (5) Fearing shortage of sugar the controller asked the merchants to import 2000 /bags of higher rates which the merchants did on the distinct undertaking that not a single other bag will be allowed to be locally imported unless and untill the said 2000 /bags were completely sold out Inspite of such an undertaking 250/bags of sugar though actually* q- actually imported for Quatif were allowed for local delivery to the said favourite party.This was done so because after the importation of the said 2000/bags the market in India went on decreasing day by day and had tha* said favourite party not been allowed for local delivery they would have to suffer loss at Quatif,though the above- mentioned 250 /bags of the said party were cheaper than 2000 /bags, imported by merchants on Governments order#,but the marketfhad decreased furtheran# and other merchants had either imported or were to import into Quatif sugars of those cheaper rates. By allowing the said party for local delivery they were not only saved from loss but on the contrary they would gain as the local rates are to be raised in accord ance with the undertaking given by the Government. In order to conceal the fact that theiir goods were of much cheaper rate,than that of 2000 / bags they produced a fictitious invoice so that they may be allowed for local delivery. ( 6 ) No merchant was allowed to export local Ballam rice while the said favourite party was given permission for export on more than one occasioj of several hundreds of bags the Customs records would convince Your Honour about the same. Those in know were fully aware that the rate of Ballam rice had increased in India and imports to be made thereafter would cost much more, still they were allowed.The Customs records would T jMc show that a short ago S Mustafa bin Abdullatif had imported the same rice which cost cnsiderablly more than tha local rates. ^ ^ ^ —Q mer cb-&amp;rrt i s allowed to export Coffee Singapuri but Abdulla Zamil w ft g allo wed, the same because he had sold to the favorite pA-rty . Th-ere are many other proofs to support this matter but would make this application too lengthy hence only a few have been given so that Your Honour may not be given un-necessary trouble. 5o The secrecy of the Government* documents is not being maintained. All the merchants submit their weekly returns,showing therein sales of the week and balances^which alongx with other documents of the office of the controller arebbeing kept in private residnetial house which is easily accessable to the favourite party and in fact he knows each and every bit of the same hence infringement of secrecy an inquiry would certainly convince Your Honour. 6 . The control system means fixing of retail prices which may5 may help consumers hut here contrary is the casexx as for example retail rates of Rangoonirice wnre never fixed till 20 # 12*1939#i*e« about 3-^ months after the control and that of Ballam and Sugandhi are never fixed till date an indirect help to the favourite party as the retailers went un-checked and thus could purchase on future advanced rates to be fixed.An investigation would make clear why this was being done. 7. As regards prices,orders issued in para 3&amp;4 of Your Honour^ proclamation of 19 . 12 . 1939 *are fully violated personal discretion has been used to suit personal benefits,without any definate procedure and this has made merchants in general to suffer heavily to such an extent that they are not able to meet their running expenses of the firms and their usual out turns and their normal activities have been stopped inspite of reguikar transport facilities and no restriction of export of main food stuffs from India. 8 . This port has to import all its requirements from abroad hence it is but natural that at the time of fixing prices the then rates of the places of origin,local stocks^ etc etc ought to be taken into consideration so that the normal imports may not be affected thus there may be no shortage but this has not been observed at this place with the result that the imports have deereased and stocks have \ gone so low that if at any time restriction on export of any food stu fff in place of its origin is put or transport difficulties occur there is to be actual shortage at this place within a very short time.Besides that the present procedure,instead of benefitting the consumers,have actually put them under loss as for example the price of sugar for local sales was fixed at Rs 13-4-0 per a bag at a time when the market abroad had gone high and would cost about Rs 15-8- per a bag for local delivery and there was every expectation of furt her rise in the market.The merchants of this place had large stocks of those prices on hand and they asked the authorities for a reason able rate so that they may import the goods in Bahrein but in vain with the result that some merchants sold in India on only a small margin of profit and those who had facilities in other Gulf ports diverted their goods to those places.Thereafter the rates abroad increased by leaps and bounds thus no fresh imports could be made by* 1 ■x 7 major portion who are suffering,specially British subjects who are mostly interested into this trade* 12* Hoping to be excused as circumstances have obliged us to take up Your Honour’s precious time otherwise we are being nearly T ruined and the Customs records will prove that all our normal actvitieg have been stopped which might cause starvation if continued in the same way* With a humble request that the above will receive Your Honour’s personal attention. Thanking you in anticipation. After writing the above we have come to know that the rice, unfit for human consumption,mentioned in part ( 1 ) of para &lt; 4 of this application are being mixed with the sound,by the favourite party,and sold to the public.v Ref .FC/ y \ IV ^ &amp; TJae Honourable The Political Agent ol H.

I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant, Captain, FOOD CONTROLLER, BAHRAIN Enclosures? &lt;^2.Page 1, paras I and 2i pa ge 4, para 5, Page 5, para 7 • The contents ot this letter were made known to the merchants at a General Meeting held on 29th March* They were unanimous in their opinion that the present system of Pood Control was satisfactory and that the procedure aaopted by the Food Controller was not detrimental to the interests of any one* They offered to submit their books for inspection to prove this. Finally they expressed their confiaence in and loyalty to the Food Controller and his Assistants and paid tribute to Mr* Cumby’s past and present services in the interests of the Government and the Trading Community. Pag e 1, paras 5, 4 and (1) « The Food Control System has not been responsible for this in any way* Customs Departments records will prove that at least 6o£ oi the ^ Local Trade in Rangooni Rice has always been in the hands of one particular merchant. 16,000 bags of Rice were imported by this particular merchant along with the Government consignment of Rice, but the order was placed with the approval of H. B. M*s Government and the Bahrain Government before the appointment of a Food Controller. Bills of Entry held by the Customs Department will prove that Rice CUd has always been imported between 8th November, 1939, and 27th January, 1940, and that prices at source have increased and not decreased • ^ Page 2, para 2 • No rate for Segundi Rice has ever been fixed by the Food Controller. Page 5, para 3 • The Rice in question was received by the Customs Department of the Government of Bahrain whose documents will prove this allegation to be false. The Rice in hand is stored by the Customs Department and has since been weighed, checked and found to be in order. In November the Committee for Food Stuffs agreed that the Food Controller should request Importers not to place new orders for Rice abroad but to purchase from Government stocks instead. The Importers agreed to do this as documentary evidence will prove ,-2- (If Sacks were purchased from Government and merchants are now oilering to purchase the remaining Government stock* This did not apply to consignments of Rice already shipped irom source or awaiting shipments and Customs Department’s documents will show that thousands of sacks of Rice were accordingly imported between November 1939, and end of January,1940• Page 3, para 4 * No Regulation has been violated, as the Rice was sold at the rate fixed by the pood Controller. Pages 3 and 4* para 5 * 250 bags of sugar were bought at the same price as the 2,000 bags and were imported with the mutual consent of all interested parties. Customs Department’s documents will support this. Page 4, para 6 • Customs Department's documents will prove that no merchant has been given permission to export Ballam Rice since the introduction of the Food Control System, but that permission has been granted by the Rood Controller ( by virtue of the authority vested in him under Reg.

Respected Sir, ^ humbly and respectfully beg to request that on 21st February 1940 we had applied, to the Controller of f ood-stuffs, Bahrain, for the export of washing soap, manufactu red by us at this place, to the Mainland, which remained without a reply for more than month and thereafter some correspondence passed between us, i.e. the Controller and m*r ourselves, copies of which are beinp enclosed herewith, and on 2 ’ 5 ra inst i.e. after more than two months we received a reply wherein we have been refused the permission. The correspondence would reveal that despite our guarantees and undertakings that the permission for export would in no way affect our stocks for local requirements, which we undertook to keep sufficient to meet six months local demand, and as the rates of raw materials have gone hiih and may decline any time hence we could not keep more than that, and had clearly proved therein that the refusal of export would serve no other purpose but to put us under loss, without any profit to consumers or any one else, still we were refused the permission. We are at a loss to understand that what purpose, other than putting us under loss, could be served by refusal of export despite our undertakings that the said export is to be made from the goods to be imported by us over and above those for local requirements and the importation of the same i.e. exce ss goods could not be made if the permission was not pranted hence the export could absolutely have no effect on our stocks for local requirements. Having full faith in the lustioe of His Majesty's Government we request that your Honour will be pleased to look into the matter, and we are confident that we can fully satisfy Your Honour that the permission for export would not decrease, in the least, our stocks for local requirements and the refusal would serve no other purpose hut to put us under loss without any profit to consumers or any one else, and thus redress ourour grievance by granting us the required permission.

At the time of this arrival the price fixed by Food Controller for sugar per sack already in Bahrain was Rs.13/4/-. There were sufficient stocks here without the new consignment. Now, the prl^e cost of all the sugar of this consignment (except the 251 bags in question) was higher than that on the market, therefore, it was decided ( 1 ) to ask the Importers of the higher priced sugar to re-export to keep prices down and ( 2 ) to keep the cheaper priced sugar in Bahrain, and in this case the merchant concerned was not permitted to re-export as his profit was adequate at the existing selling rate. It should be noted that the Importere, who re exported, did so upon instructions from Food Controller. S.Z.q *?

The Food Controller’s Order No,FC/2/59 of the 12th February 1940, fixed the retail selling price of Swedish Matches at Rs.2/~ per gross, which is twelve packets of one dozen boxes each. Consequently the selling price of one dozen packets would be not more than two annas nine pies. Since that date there has been no occasion to alter this selling price, as there has not been any further import of Swedish matches On the 5th August, I purchased from the Indian Hesturant here, one dozen packet of these matches for which I was charged three annas. My servant purchased a one-dozen packet from one Thanverdas, a local shop keeper, an Indian subhect, for which he was charged three annas and six pies. This morning mv Food Inspector purchased a one-dozen packet from the same shopkeeper for whicl he was charged three annas and six pies. • I submit that this charge is too high, and amounts to profiteering; and having regard to Coause ten of the Order issued by H.B.M’s Political Agent, under Emergency Regulation No.2., I ask you please to initiate a prosecution accordingly. * ******** Original Copy given to the Indian Assistant, for .-actionConfidential No,C/653-1•a/48• Political Agency, Bahrain, the 9th August 1940.

To:- H.B.M's Political Agent, } BAHRAIN: /¥/ MEMORANDUM: - I invite your attention to the Order No:FC/2/59., of 12th February, 1940, issued by The Food Controller, which limited the retail sale price of Swedish Matches to Rs:2/- per gross. The last import of these matches from Gotenburg occurred ex s.s.*City of Barcelona' in January last; and it seems unlikely another imoort will come forward from Europe for some time, although similar matches may be exported hither from India. Consequently the supplies in the local bazar are diminishing. Mr Hussain Yateem, trading as A.M.Yateem Brothers, has had extensive business relations with The Bahrein Petroleum Coy.Ltd., and is regarded by them as their 'Factor', which I assume to mean their Buying Agent; and as such there is no objection to his charging the Company five per cent commission on purchases, for his services. I enclose herewith a letter of complaint from The Bahrein Petroleum Coy Ltd regarding their recent purchase of 150 gross of Swedish matches at an average price of Rs.2-4-3.» per gross. The transaction was a large one; and a price belowy^ Rs:2/- per gross might have been expected, had the market supplies been abundant. I ask that a prosecution may be instituted upon Mr Hussain Yateem for purchasing and re-selling Swe&amp;sh matches at a rate higher than the sanctioned price; and would also ask the Court to ascertain the dealers who supplied the matches to Mr Hussain Yateem, so that they also may be prosecuted for a like offence, please. Enel os: - FOODThe Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited Awali, Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, G. G. L. de G-renier, Esq,, Food Controller, Manama, Bahrein. Sir, Recently the Bahrein Petroleum Company needed matches. Messrs, Yateem Brothers were approached and asked if the could supply 'Flower Basket' Safety matches. That firm did not have the quantity we desired; hut on July B5th, in a telephone conversation, they said that, acting on written permission from the Controller, they had approached another firm of merchants in Manama, They stated'that this firm had sufficient matches hut would only sell case lots at Rs:170 per case of 75 gross. The Company agreed to order two cases at the price quoted. l/grr* After the matches had been delivered to the Company the papers of this transaction came before me, after perusing them, I came to the conclusion that the matter'ought to be brought to your notice. Ft and In your communication to me of July 17th (FC/85/59) rou stated that the retail price of Tvedish' matches was Rs:2/-/- per gross, Messrs, Yateem Brothers charged us Rs,34C for 2 cases - 150 gross - of 'Swedish' matches, plus Rs, 17 buying commission. ~ 1 In a transaction of this size one would expect to /pay considerably less than the retail price, but even if the * Comoany had to pay the full retail price, the amount they were charged is'in excess of the retail price given in your ' ^ ~ O ' —- communication of July 17th. -j(M, Either Messrs. Yateem Brothers, or the merchants from whom they bought, or perhaj^s both these parties, appear to have profiteered in this transaction.p 7 MuTHE CUSTOMHOUSE: - ' BAHRAIN: 2oth August, 1940., No PA/FC/ A 15th Rajab, 1359. , To: - H.B.M’s Political Agent, BAHRAIN: MEMORANDUM:- In reference to bulk commodities available for sale in this State, the total of the stocks now held partly by the Direct Importers and partly by the Local Wholesalers, may be summarised as follows:- Commodity: Estimated period of sufficiency: GHEE, Hollandy: • • • . six ] months' supply; Vegetable, • • • .five i months' 11 ' Khaldi, • • • . five it II COFFEE,Singapuri &amp; Native, it 11 SUGAR, Java, • • • six it 11 WHEAT FLOUR: Indian (best) . two m n (regular ” ' Iraqi (medium).... . three ti ti turnover, CARDAMONS,TURMERIC,&amp; DHALL, . three n 11 do.

It may be of Interest to submit a note upon the local position of the market in Java Sugar:- At the outbreak of war, a system of Food Control was ^ established in the State of Bahrain under the authority vested in H.B.M’s Political Agent, by Order under Regulation No.2. On 11th September, 1939, local traders were classed as: (a) Direct Importers, (b) Local wholesale purchasers, (c) Retail Dealers (i.e. general shop-keepers). Direct Importers were then ordered to sell their stocks on hand at Rs:13/- per bag of 2 cwts (i.e. 4 Bahrain maunds). The s.s. ’Begum* on 12th September, discharged 700 tons of Java sugar; and, in view of its prime cost, the Direct Importers' sale price was fixed at Rs:13-4-0., per bag. At that time there was a good stock of sugar available for sale; but a very firm control over retail sales had to be enforced to prevent hoarding for profiteering purposes by the local shop-keepers. For the following three months there were no imports; and on the 6 th December, the sale price was fixed at n/e Rs:l6-8-0 per bag, to check the shop-keepers' demands. (Contd:-2 \ ' 2 ' Until the institution of the Food Control, the of sugar followed closely the Indian market prices, and fluctuated accordingly. On 22nd January, 1940., s.s.’Bandra’ discharged two thousand bags of Java sugar, imported as follows Messrs Dhamanmal Isardas, Regular Importer.......350 bags. ' A. A. Bass am, ' ” * * * * ^° ' .

' Hirjimal Djamanmal, Soap maker. 150 Dags. » Goverdandaa Dharamdas, Ghee importer, 2oo bags. « P. Visoomal, non-importer, 150 bags. It should be noted that the last three are not regularly concerned in the import and re-sale of Java Sugar. During the past year Messrs Hirlimal Dhamanmal imported only fifty bags of coffee, w hil® Messrs G. Dharamdas imported only one hundred bags of coffee, and two hundred bags of rice; also P.Visoomal, a local wholesaler, has not imported a bag of anything for the past five years. The prime cost of the above import worked out at R s .26/-p/bag. On 12th February, further to restrict local purchases, the price was raised to Rs:19-8-0; and again on the 1st April the price was raised to Rs.22/- per bag. —N The demand for the Bandra sugar became aoparent by mid- Aoril when, to protect the above importers from loss, the selling, rate was fixed at Ra; 28 /- per ha©, tn xou* a mooing or tne above was summoned, when the concerned were asked to continue tneir imports so that local stocks may be maintained, and the Food Controller promised that the above importers should not suffer loss in their sales a alfceBkt&amp;nn in price; and consequently the price remained unchange f three months to enable the above stocks to be sold. In fact about 1500 bags were so sold; but it appears that the above soap-ipaker, the ghee-importer, and the non-importer have held on to part of their stocks, probably in the hope of a further inrtease in the local price. On the 23rd July (about three months later) s.s. Nur Mahal brought 243 tons of sugar, and s.s. ’Silver Dawn* brought 100 tons. Consequently the local price had to be adjusted; and on 29th July, i was fixed at n/e Rs:22-4-0 per bag, at which it now remains. It must of course be understood that this is a maximum price; and it is a fact that local Importers sell at a lower price according to competition, to which there can be no objection. It follows that Messrs Hirjimal Dhamanmal, Goverdhandas ^Dharamdas, and P. Visoomal, are likely to suffer a loss by their non-sale during the above three months. These traders, who were formerly represented by one Karkoomal, now in India, now appear to be agitating by correspondence against the functioning of the Food Control wi statements partly untrue, partly nonsensical, and wholly mischievous. I do not suggest that serious attention need be given to this kind of agitation; but since H.B.M’s Political Agent has previous y troubled by similar agitation, possibly anonymous, I think it well that he should be aware of such mischievous activities.Letter dated the 24th August 1940 from Director of Customs to Political Agent, Bahrain.

Copy to:- The Adviser, The Government of Bahrain;D.G..NO* 155/FC. Bahrain, February 24, 1941, Dear Alban, The day before yesterday I had a talk with the leading importers of rice and discussed the possible ejj^ect on imports should Japan enter the war* Our present position is most satisfactory. We have, in Bahrain, a supply of rice which will last at the very least for eight months and there is more rice on the way and in Bombay waiting for shipment to Bahrain* The merchants pointed out that if Rangoon rice was not available owing to disturbances in that direction it would be possible to purchase rice grown on the west coast of India which used to be the custom in the past. We have supplies of sugar which will last almost a year and also supplies of tea and coffee sufficient for at least eight months. After discussing the matter very thoroughly with deOrenier and the merchants I am of the opinion that it is not necessary at present for the government to take any special measures to increase the import of essential foodstuffs. Yours sincerely, Major R. G. E. W. Alban, O.B.E.,Confidential No -C/188-1.a/48. ny The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compliments to:— The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain, and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (s) The Agency, BAHRAIN, Persian Gulf Dated -S 6 -th February 1941.

Tv Possible effect on imports to Bahrain should Japan enter the war.K. B. M’s Political Agent, B/ill RAIN • Sir, YHB CU3T01/HOUSB: B/JiRAIN 6 th March, 1941., 8 th Saffar, 1260. I have the honour to report upon the Pood Control system now operating in the State of Bahrain: 3arly in August 1929, in view of the antic ip? ted outbreak of vs/ar in Surope, local market conditions caused some concern to the Bahrain Government, as prices became unsteady, while certain commodities were being withheld from sale, and it was feared that the regularity of imports would be upset. in the last week of that month commercial unrest became marked; so the Government decided to be concerned in the position, and appointed a Pood Controller on 26th August, 1929 (loth Rajah, 12b8j, whose duty v/as to build up and maintain a six months* supply of essential foodstuffs, to keep prices as low as possiole, and to prevent hoarding. The Government of Bahrain’s ahlan of 26th August, 1939, (loth Rajah, 1358; prohibited (1) local exports of foodstuffs, (2) increase in prices over the rates then prevailing, and (3) refusal of sales to the public. On 2nd September, 1939, a meeting of leading importers was held when the opinion was expressed that ( 1 ) traders should be classed as (a) Direct Importers, (b; Local wholesale dealers, and (c) retailers; and ( 2 ) that rates should be fixed for each class of trader, by the Pood Controller. This opinion was accepted by the Government; and r? tes were fixed whereby the Direct Importers v/ere allowed five per cent profit, and the other two classes profited in proporition. Experience has shown that this m?rgin of profit was inadequate; so it was doubled, with the exception of cement and ghee where the margin of profit was fixed at 15^ so as to allow for a leakage of five per cent. In order to keep a necessary check upon dealings, it was arranged that a weekly return of stocks should be rendered, and that local wholesale dealers should maintain a record of their sales and purchases. This system has been maintained, and prices are revised at least once in every ten days, but more frequently if a fresh import renders an alteration necessary. All controlled prices are published, and the dealers concerned are also notified *by circular. On 19th December, 1959, this position was regularised by an Order by h. B. M’s Political Agent under Regulation 2. made by the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, which also included a clause aimed at punishing profiteering. I give a comparison between pre-war and present stocks of the main commodities of foodstuffs COMMODITY : PRE- -VAR stocks present Stocks ; Rice : 28,000 bags . 43, GOO bags: Flour: S ,100 ' 2,000 ' : Java Sugar: 4,000 ' 11,000 ' : Ghee, pure &amp; Veg. 2,400 tins . 5, 000 tins: Coffee : 3 ,000 bags . 2,000 beg s: Tea: 700 cases. 650 ceses Spices: 800 bags . 1,000 bags: Average maximum \ 5-6,000 bags. 1,800 M . 1,300 M . 800 tins. 300 bags, as per demand.:This should serve to confirm the opinion that a part oi the increase in cost of steamer-borne goods is due to increased freight and war insurance charges. It is however important to remember that the sanctioned prices are the maximum prices; and that many sales take place at lower than the official prices. This is due to normal business competition and is a satisfactory indication of business activity. It should be of considerable interest to compare the controlled prices with the actual sale prices locally in the main commodities; COliMODITY ; UNIT : CCNTROLLBD ACTUAL 3,ULE PRICE : PRICES: Rs; : Rs; Rangoon Rice imaund of 56 lbs ; 5.5.0 : 4.1C .0 to 4.12 Balam Rice ; -do- : 5.12.0 : 5. 6.0 t o 5 . 8 Karachi Sugandi rice: ; -do- : 4.11.0 : • CD » o Coffee Singapuri. ;ruba of 4 lbs : 0 . 15.6 0.15.0 Java Sugar: : i &amp; 0 1 0 . 8.0 0 . 6.6 to 0.7.0 Persian Ghee , pure : -do- : 2 . 8.0 2. 4.0 Holland!

It must also be remembered that the needs of che State of Bahrain are the first consideration of the Food Control; and consequently complaints from such as may be interested in exporting foodstuffs from Bahrein which are not in transit rb cargo must not receive undue consideration, since the position now is that no one is entitled to export foodstuffs or piece goods. GSIBBRA L: Other general commodities are not controlled; but it has been noticed thet the prices of provisions imported from Great Britain have increased locally from to 4(^, partly due to lack of imports, partly to increase cost of freight and war insurance, and partly due to lack of complaints of over-charging under Clause 12. Cigarettes of various origins have increased by about 40/£; hardware and cooking utensils by 100 %; and haberdashery and hosiery by 40 ^ ; headwear and footwear by 30%, and Indian cement by 27%. It is the business of the Police Department to report for prosecution instances of profiteering; and so far no complaints have been received. There is no shortage of essential foodstuffs in the local market, and the stocks at present held by the importers exceed those at the outbreak of war.

Several importers were in possession of the relative invoices, but several were not. It was therefore decided to permit these latter to clear their consignments under the 'Provisional Duty” system, which enables goods to come upon the market without delay, and the valuation for duty is adjusted later. This system does not, of course, supply the latest purchase price of the commodity at the time of clearance; and such information is needed for adjusting the controlled sale prices locally at least every ten days. It has therefore been deciddd to adjust the new prices with such information as is available; and this will of course be re-adjusted as soon as the relative invoices come forward.

'Sui Sanp; 11 , In reference to the above steamer, it will be remembered that the expected quantity of wheat flour was One h^undred bags, and also 500 bags for RE, brought hither by Messrs Dhamanmal Isardas; and it was decided, in view of the acute shortage in this State, that these five hundred bags should be imported into Bahrain. News has also come forward that the s.s.’Barala* expected this week, would bring about two thousand bags of flour, enough for one month's consumption in this State, without any reserve stock. Also, several small quantities are expected by native craft. The quantities actually discharged by s.s. n Sui Sang' were: Importer: r 1 - Quantity: Quality: Bags: 1. Muhummad Sharif Shekrulla 100.

Total :- bags » — As there was no bread in the bazar, and the bakers were all clamouring for flour, it was decided to issue the flour direct from the Customs to the bakers, and the Customs was opened on Friday for that purpose, one bag then being issued to each baker. On that day no invoices were available for ascertaining the wholesale and the retails prices, but a deposit value was assessed, to save time. On the next day two bags were issued, and afterwards four bags, so that all the bakers were put to work, and bread became available to the public. The regular procedure was followed; i.e. each importer was given a permit to se&amp;l a number of bags to each wholesaler, who was then given a permit to sell numbers of bags to the bakers, and then to such householders as make their own bread. The intention was that the wholesaler should have his permit endorsed as to payment by the importer; and the retailer should have his permit endorsed as to payment by the wholesaler. But in view of credit accounts existing, this procedure became unnecessary, and the retailer preferred to pa# the cost of his bags in the Customs, which cash was then handed to his wholesaler, who in some cases was also the importer; and everyone was satisfied, as the flour was paid for cash down, and the importer had no trouble in • collecting his dues.- 2 - In the meanwhile the importers, mostly, have cleared their imports through the Customs, having produced relative invoices, which enabled the Food Control to fix the proper prices, which in the case of Nusserwanjy No.2. was Rs:15-7-0 per bag, the previous fixed price having been Rs:15-12-0. Objection to this procedure has been taken by Mr Muljy, the local member of the firm of Dhamanmal Isardas, who claims: 1. That his 5oo bags § being marked R.E., should go to the mainland, where they were intended, as he can make more profit there than in Bahrain. 2. That he is unable to produce invoices as there may have been demurrage charges accruing in Karachi, and the fixed price of Rs.35-7-0 would involve him in less profit. (The price of Rs:15-7-0. allows a profit of ten per cent to the importer). 3. That when the quantity in the s.s.’Barala* is discharged, there will be no shortage of flour in Bahrain. 4. That he always likes to help the Government, and would therefore like permission to Re-Export,say, two hundred of these bags. In the meanwhile this importer has refused to endorse the sales permits issued to wholesalers upon his import. It would of course be possible to deliver these bags to the retailers, collecting the cost thereof, as in the other instances; and the proceeds would be duly paid to the importer. Before deciding to do this, however, I prefer to report to you the whole position and to enquire your views. I naturally do not wish to proceed harshly, as the local dearth is temporarily relieved; but I cannot see how this importer can suffer any loss, although he may perhaps make more profit by selling on the mainland. 6e.iajZf, CONTROLLER f , &amp;The CUSTOMHOUSE, BAHRAIN. 15th May, 1941., 19th Rabia.ii.i 360 ., On examining the manifest of the s.s.'Barala', which arrived in port this morning, I find that the quantity of wheat flour for this port aggregates only 556 bags, with an additional 95 for R.E., thus totalling 651 bags, a little more than one week’s normal supply. You will remember that we were expecting 2,o25 bags; so this is a great disappointment. Under these circumstances I feel that we are not justified in permitting the re-export of Messrs Dhamanmal Isardas’ five hundred bags which arrived here on the Sui Sang, as local needs require these bags for consumption in Bahrain. I should be happy to hear that you concur in this opinion, and authorise me to have the bags sold locally, as I had first planned to do.

Sir, \ 9 I have the honour to refer to the question of food supplies in Bahrain. 2. As you know the food situation is in charge of the Food Controller whose duty it is to regulate imports and exports in such a way as to ensure that a sufficient supply of food for the local inhabitants is always on hand. Recently owing to irregular sailings and lack of shipping space in the B.I. mailboats supplies of flour ceased altogether and for some days there was no bread to be had in the town. Such a situation, if prolonged, might easily give rise to bread riots on the part of the poorer inhabitants and it is our object to try and avoid any similar situation in future. 3. I understand from the General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company that some of the oil tankers coming to Bahrain touch at Indian ports. These tankers come up in ballast and could carry a very large amount of supplies but are I understand unable to do so. This appears to be due to some obstruction on the part of the B.I.S.N. Company. The result of this is that we had and still have some thousands of bags of flour lying unshipped in Karachi owing to lack of space on the B.I. mails while at the same time the public here /-2 here are going without flour and tankers are coming up empty. 4. I understand that a certain quantity of naval stores, rations and other articles are brought up in B.I. boats and the effect of this is that for every ton of naval stores shipped by B.I. maile one ton of food supplies etc., for Bahrain and other ports has to be left behind, and I would suggest for consideration the possibility of some arrangement being come to with the Bahrain Petroleum Company for shipping naval stores by tanker as far as Bahrain whence they could be sent onwards to Basra on the B.I. malls which after un loading considerable quantities of cargo at this and other ports are likely to have room for a fairly considerable amount of cargo between here and Basra. This would enable a larger amount of food supplies to be brought out from India for the consumption of the people of this Island and would help to avert any possibility of acute shortage of food* 51 I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Politijeal Agent, BahrainConfidential sh 0 ^ No. C/472 &gt; The Political Agent Bahrain, Presents his compliments to:— The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document ( s ) The Agency, BAHRAIN, Persian Gulf. &gt; k : i 'w Dated 18th May 1941 Reference to previous correspondence: Description of Enclosure. i' Name and Date, f Letter No. C/471 dated the 18th May 1941 to the Naval Officer- In-Charge, Bahrain. /iwi J \ 7 t \ Subject. i A J Food Situation in Bahrain,No. C/473 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 19th May 1941.

Sir, A I have the honour to refer to your No.C/473 dated 19th May, 1941, regarding the Food Control Order. The reference in the Order to re-export or tran shipment of goods is somewhat vague but - implies that there shall be no restriction on such transactions. At the time when the proclamation was issued it was con sidered desirable not to restrict in any way trade between Bahrain and the mainland. Conditions have changed since then and at times transhipment imports to the mainland through Bahrain are urgently required for local consump tion. It would be very beneficial for Bahrain if re export and transhipment could be made subject to the permission of the Food Controller. Before considering any alteration in the Order I should like to discuss the matter with the senior Shaikhs. Their point of view, even in matters benefitting Bahrain, is apt to be affected by, their strong desire to avoid giving offence to King Ibn Saud. \ S&gt; I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.

V oir&gt; A / I have the honour to refer to your letter No. C/473 dated 19th May 1941 and my reply No. 908/SF dated 26th May 1941. 2. I have discussed this matter with the Shaikhs. Their point of view is that if the food control rules were amended so that the Food Control ler could insist on Nejdi merchants in Bahrain land ing RE cargo destined for Saudi-Arabia in Bahrain, it would cause a protest from the Saudi-Arabian government which they consider undesirable and likely to disturb the good relations existing between the two countries. 3. They suggest that should an emergency occur action could be taken at the time without publishing a revised proclamation. If the merchants concerned were Bahrain subjects they would be ordered by their |/yi» government to land the goods Bahrain: in the case- 2 - © case of foreign subjects perhaps it would be pos sible for the Political Agent to order the importer to divert his goods into Bahrain if a real and urgent need existed in the country for the goods in question. 4. I think myself it would be best to leave matters as they are at present and to deal with any isolated cases which occur in future according to the food situation then existing in Bahrain.
