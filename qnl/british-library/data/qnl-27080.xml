Al-Samarqandī was a Persian scientist who lost his life during the cataclysmic Mongol invasions of the early 13th century. He appears to have died during the siege of Herat in 1222. He was a famous physician and the author of many medical texts. Nothing more is known of his life. The frontispiece of each of the books in the volume is illuminated with a scroll and vine design and a medallion in which the name of the author and the title of the book appear. The pages of both books consist generally of 25 lines of text, set in a rectangular border. The copyist has signed his name as ‘Abd al-‘Alī al-Kātib al-Shirāzī. The copying of the first work was completed on April 12, 1601. Both works contain numerous explanatory notes and marginalia in Arabic, as well as some in Persian. There are also notes recording the purchase of the book by previous owners and an elaborate but effaced seal.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Uzbekistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arabic manuscript</topic></subject><subject><topic>Nutrition</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/9549#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
