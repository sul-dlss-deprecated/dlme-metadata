Separate registers should be maintained for civil suits and for execution cases. I have written in one of your registers the headings under which details of execution cases should be given. 2. For the time being it is not necessary to enter in the main civil suit register the details of petitions received which relate to cases already under trial. I will give you separately the form in which a register of miscella neous petitions should be maintained. 3. In the civil suit register it is essential to note the actual nature of a claim. It is insufficient merely to record the amount claimed and further details should be inserted showing whether for instance it is a suit for recovery of a loan, for payments for goods supplied, the settlement of accounts between partners or business associa tes, for wages or whatever else may be the cause of action. 4. I noted 4# certain cases which were marked 'absconders' in the civil suit register. I gathered that these related to petitions accepted on Re. 1/- court fee stamps claiming payment of dues of any amount from persons who are alleged to have left Bahrain. While it is open to creditors to inform the Court that an alleged debtor has left Bahrain and to ask that any property he has left behind may be taken in custody, it is not open tc them to claim their dues on mere Re. 1/- court fee stamps. If they wish to sue for monies due to them they must sue on full court fees. The procedure to be followed in regard to claims against estates of deceased persons is laid down in the© ^ - 2 - n Foreign Jurisdiction (probates) Order in Council 1935«. 5. I noticed one case in which a petition with a He. 1/- court fee stamp for revival of a suit dismissed for non- attendance of the plaintiff had been admitted. Great care should be taken in regard to requests for revival of cases and unless the very best reasons are given by such an applicant for his failure to conduct his case he should be told that it can only be revived on payment of full court fees again. 6. In regard to cases for the Majlis al Tajara and the Qadhis Courts. I am arranging separately for Agency and Joint Court cases to be sent fortnightly only and this should save ^certain amount of time. The register of such cases should be maintained by the Court Clerk and records should only be handed over to the Daftri for removal from the office on the day on which the cases are to be presented to these various courts. The Daftri can of course be ins tructed to issue * summonsyif necessary and there is no need for him to remove the record from the office for this purpose. 7. Immediately on the day following the submission of any such case to the Majlis or to the Qadhis, the Daftri should submit the case to you personally for perusal of the temporary or final order of the Majlis or Qadhis, so that c - you take necessary action at once. 8. I observe in the criminal case register maay cases in which fines only have been imposed without sentences of imprisonment in default. Presumably default sentences have not been passed since fines were paid immediately. ’But in order that there should be no error the criminal case register should contain entries showing that fines passed have been paid, and the dates of payment should be noted. 9. You should keep your diary personally and immediatelyyou fix a date fox* any case you should enter the number of that case under the appropriate date in your diary. I will continue my examination later and pass further orders thereafter. Political Agent.Dated the 30th ApriX 1040• o « G L a I fp DwO. Mo. /V2 -A/c ■ Daring an-inapection of the Indian Assistant*s Court I found that cases from the Agency and Junior Joint Courts are being sent to the Sunni and Shia» Qadiiis and to the llajiis al Tajotra for practically every meeting of these bodies end I believe that cases go to each such meeting from the Bahrain Courts too. 2.

I have not recorded any formal inspection notes after inspecting the Courts of the Assistant Political /.gent and the Indian Assistant here; nor indeed can I find any record of any such inspections by my predecessors. 3. So far as the Assistant Political Agent is concerned my practice has peen to examine a proportion of the cases that he has tried and then, whenever necessary, to discuss with him any deficiencies in procedure that there may nave been. The Assistant Political Agent does not have a separate daftur and records of his cases are kept in the Indian Assistant’s record room. 4. As for the Indian Assistant’s Court I have made it a practice to pay periodic visits and generally to give verbal instructions. The last time I inspected however I did actually record a note of which I send a copy herewith. I delayed the continuation of my inspection pending a reply from you to my demi-official letter No* 858-A.O. of the 30th April 1340• Yours sincerely. Cc.ptam A.U. Stewart, ...A., Secretary to the hon’bie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushare 'KNOTE ON THE INSPECTION OF THE COUNT OF THE INDIAN ASSISTANT, BAHRAIN. There is no record available of any regular annual inspection being carried out prior to this. The records were accordingly inspected for the period 1st January 1940- 31st December 1940. 2. The register of criminal cases shows that during this period only 294 cases were registered. This figure however includes 2 cases tried by the Political Agent and 19 cases tried by the Assistant Political Agent. ( i the 273 cases fried by the Indian Assistant 118 cases were tried by Dr. S.M. Siddiq and 155 by Khan Sahib Mirza Ismail. Of the 113 cases tried by Dr. Siddiq' 65 were tried summarily. Khan Sahib Ismail has niht been invested with summary powers. It cannot therefore be said that the criminal work of the Court is excessive. Such as it is however -he work seems to be carried out prompHy and without undue delay• At the end of the year only 4 cases were pending and these were all settled within the first week of January 1941. 3* I- was observed that only one register is maintained for all the three Courts of the Political A-enu, Assistant Political Agent and Indian Assistant. It seems desirable in order to facilitate the work of future Inspecting Officers that each of the three Courts should maintain separate registers . If the criminal work of the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent is considered to be insufficient to justify the maintenance of separate registers it would meet the requirements of Inspecting Officers if the serial numbers of their cases are entered separately at some different place in the same register.In column 11 under the head 'sentence or final oruer ' the magistrate should quote the Section of the Criminal Procedure Code or Indian Penal Code under which orders have been passed, and in the case of fines he should also state whether any alternative sentence has oeen passed in default of payment. The magistrate should also in all cases make an entry in the remarks column 14 showing whether fines have been recovered. The date of commission of the offence should be entered in column 2 of the register. Column 5, nationality of the accused should also be completed. 5. There is no seperate register maintained for cases tried summarily and in many instances where cases have actually been tried summarily there is nothing in the proceedings to show that this is so, apart from the fact the records contain neither evidence nor charge sheet. It would facilitate the work of the court if in future all cases tried summarily were entered in a special book kept for the purpose, no other records being maintained. A specimen form is attached to this note. b. It is observed that in many instances where the case has been disposed of before charges have been framed against the accused the final order shows the accused to be acquitted. This is incorrect. The accused should have been discharged. The attention of the magistrate may be drawn to Section 253 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 7. The court maintains no register of pending cases. Though the number of such cases are few it would facilitate the work of the District Judge in supervising the work of the court if the court were to maintain a register in the manner prescribed in Form C of the Circular Orders issued by the Bombay High Court 1925. A monthly criminal return of caseswould enable supervising officers to see at a glance whether fines have been paid in full at the time of passing sentance or whether any amounts remain outstand ing to be collected. 10. In case No.6 of 1940 there is no clear statement of the plea of the accused, nor is there a record of any prosecution evidence having been heard. The accused has however been convicted on the grounds that the magistrate disbelieves his statement. Though the case appears to have been tried summarily mere disbelief by the magistrate of the accused’s denial is insufficient to justify a conviction without at least hearing some prosecution evidence. H. Case No.25. Accused acquitted yet no evidence recorded and no charges framed. Accused should have been discharged. 12. Case No.21 of 1940 contains no statement of accused, no evidence for prosecution nor any charge framed, defence evidence is however recorded and accused acquitted. If there is no evidence in support of the complaint the accused should have been discharged or the case dismissed. 13. Case No.39. There are two accused and two separate offences. Accused Nos.l and 2 have both been convicted of the second offence and accused No.l alone of the first ofience. No charges were however framed for the second offence, nor is there any record of the accused’s statements being taken. 14. In almost all cases the proceedings have been carelessly maintained, there being no record to show the dates on which witnesses were called and examinedn® noi any reason given for adjournments excepting the final adjournment for judgment.7 ' ) The Residency» JKishire f trie Idth January 1941 V/ill you please refer to the correspondenc on the subject of the inspection of the Indian Assistants court* 1 realise that it is not always easy for the Political Agent to find time to make a thorough inspection of the Indian Assistant's court and it has occurred to me that it may save you considerable trouble if Stewart does it tnis year instead of you* if you agree, you please tell him to carry on with the inspection when he is in Bahrain* He has powers of an Additional Sessions Judge in Bahrain. or R.G*W.Alban, Political Agent, Bahrain* Uzlt^ ^ u L Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Caiap, Shiraz • D.O.No.C/282 Dated the 11th August, 1940.

No. 52//J, dated the 14th September 1942 Description of Enclosure. Name and Date. Subject. Forms A and G , relating to Monthly and Quarterly Returns of criminal cases of the Circular Orders issued by the High Court of Bombay for the guidance of Criminal Courts. Court of the Indian Assistant, Bahrain.I have been looking at the hgency Civil and Criminal Registers, and it appears that judicial work has considerably decreased. I would be glad to know if , .A, ascribes this to any particular cuase. 2. The Record of Summary cases is not always very clear, and if this is the sole record it should be compiled more carefully and the proceedings signed. 1 would be glad to know whether any record apart f rom this is main ained, and what differentiation there is in summary powers between the I• who aopears to handle the bulk of the cases, and the P.A. who I understand also handles certain cases summarily. 3. In the record of criminal cases the court is not mentioned in many instances though this was the practice formerly and is useful as showing the distribution of work between the various courts. The records of cases Nos. 18 and 20 dated 4/5/42 and 27/5/42 may be sent to me for perusal. I see that in a number of cases, notably No. 28 of 3/8/42 and No. 40 and 41 of 11/11/42 and No. 45 of 21/11/42 fines were inflicted but not apparently recovered. 1 would be glad to know what action was taken when it Wcs found that the fine could not be levied. Id/- C.4.P. 31/3/43 r.A. Bahrain Paragraph I of ?. Bs not e I think that the decrease in judicial work in the Agency courts in recent years is mainly due to two reasons (1) King's Regulation No. 2 of 1937 (the Passport Regulation) has made control of immigration so effectivethat ’’undesirable” foreigners in Bahrain are b :coming fewer and fewer. This, of course y reduces the number of petty criminal cases with which Agency courts have had to deal. (2) King’s Regulation No. 1 of 1937, which disabled Persia subjects from owning immoveable property in Bahrein, resulted in a very large number of Persians domiciled in Bahrain apply ing for and being given Bahrain nationality. From 1937 onwards criminal or civil cases in which such Persians were involved became triable by Bahrain courts instead of by Agency courts. This explanation receives confirmation from the fact that the number of civil and criminal cases tried by the Bahrain courts has been increasing since 1937. The number of cases, criminal and civil, tried by the Bahrain courts in recent years is as follows *- Paragraph 2 of P.l’s note :\ (a) The Register of Summary Cases does not contain the sole record of such cases but only a precis of salient facts. The original records of summary cases invariably contain a full judgement embodying the substance of the evidence and the examination of the accused. (b) The summary powers of the P.A. and the I.A. are \ similar. Most summary cases are tried by the I.A. but occasionally, for special reasons, the P.A. tries summary * \ \ cases himself. Paragraph 3 of ..a 1 * a no u e (e) Up to the end of December 1940 only one criminal register v/as maintained in the Agency.

(b) The records of cases Nos. 18 and 20 are sent herewith. In respect of case No. 20 the I.A. has recorded the following explanation *- 'The complaint was originally entertained and registered under Section 338 I.P.C. (causing grievous hurt by negligence) but during the trial it was discovered that the accused should also be tried for the offence of driving a car with defective brakes under Article VUI-d of King*e Regulation No. 1 of 1939. The accused was acquitted of the offence under Section 338 I .P .C • as it was c oapounded by the c omplalnant with the permission of the Court but the accused was held guilty of the second offence and fined Rs 15/-. The second offence v/as entered on the case sheet by me and when I inspected the register to make sure that it ras maintained properly* as I periodically do f I found that the second offence was not entered in the register by the Court Clerk. Later I instructed him to complete the entry and placed a query in blue pencil to remind him of it. But evidently he forgot to complete the entry.” (c) In cases NCs. 23 f 40 and 45 the fines were recovered and credited into the Treasury. I have veri fied this from inspection of the Fines Register. The omission to make the appropriate entry in the register of criminal cases was due to the appointment of a new Court Clerk wiwh no previous experience. In case No. 41 the fines imposed were not recovered and the accused were sent to jail. 20th April 1943.T have been looking at the Agency Civil and Cximi ax \ 2 a~ 2 terSj and it a^-^eans that judicial work has contiderahly decreased.

The registers were well kept and up to date. The register of process fees may be discontinued as I am informed that it is now customary for the police to serve processes free of charge. 2. Six criminal cases wero examined and the procedure followed was found to be generally correct. In three cases the age of the accused was not inserted on the first page of the case file and it was also noted that it did not appear to be the practice to enter the age of the accused person in the criminal case register. It is essential that the age is always entered both on the file itself and in the register. 3. The presentation of the case by the prosecution leaves much to be desired and should the accused in several of the cases have been defended by competent lawyers it is probable that the prosecution would have found it very difficult to present a satisfactory case. It should be noted that the prosecution must 'prove” previous convictions and not make an unsupported statement. Extracts from records showing previous convictions should be appended to the case file. 4. The judgments are well written but there seems to be a tendency to be rather too lenient when assessing sentences. II. CIVIL SIDE . 1 . Files of six civil cases were examined and found to be neatly and correctly kept. Unfortunately none of them dealt with matters of any importance. Therefore it has not been possible to examine how the Sub Judge of the Second Class would have framed issues and whether these issues were correctly framed. 2 . The Sub Judge appears to have misunderstood article 37 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council which deals with the2 referring oi cases to the *Shara Court* No suit should be ret erred to the f Shara Court for decision* It is for the Sub Judge himself to decide every suit but he is permitted to refer a matter in the progress of the suit which involves a point of Mohamedan law to the f Shara Court for a decision on that specific point alone* I notice a tendency to refer the entire case to the ’Bhara Court for decision and this tendency must be discouraged* 3* Again the question of reference to the Majlis-al- Thajara does not seem to be correctly understood* It is correct to refer an accounts case to them for scrutiny and adjustment but it is not correct to refer a dispute over a contract to the Majlis for decision* If there is any point of commercial or diving practice on which the Sub Judge desires information then he may ask the Majlis to enlighten him but he must decide the facts of any contract himself.

L_ Reference to previous correspondence 2 This Agency Printed Letter No.3861-T-6/J dated the 19th December, 1944. D escription of enclosure. Name and date. Sub.iect.&gt; 9 Note on Inspection of tho Indian A ssis tants Court. K v I 1. The last inspection v/as done by my predecessor on the 10th December, 1944, and I read a copy of his note on the relevant file. All registers appear to be kept correctly. No copies of the correct Current Register for Summary Cases were available when the last one was finished; and the Indian Assistant had to use spare registers printed for another purpose. Registers in the correct form should be ordered without further delay and all registers should be ordered in adequate numbers and stored and taken out as required. 2. The files of cases - both civil and criminal - which i looked at, seem to be correctly kept. 3 . p'iles of decided cases are kept in large wooden racks in the Court Clerk’s room.' These racks with sliding fronts are good containers nni t — iq ^ ^ sound thought was put into the making. But while it is clear that at different times, Indian Assistants have checked the records and destroyed those not worth retention, yet, there seems to be no standing order as to when and how often this should be done: so that while the records do not seem to be in a bad state no one could be accused of breaking any order if, in future, they accumulate in a disorderly mess. A.P.A. told me that he was looking up the rules for recording judicial cases and I should be grateful if he 'would pursue the matter and report. 4. Books of reference are adequate and in good condition^. 5. The ordinarVi^ administrative files are kept in the cupboards aforementioned and as they are, comparatively /speaking Vspeaking, few in number, they are listed in a couple of typed sheets. Nevertheless, a register should be opened for them. At the end of the year the series OkA*'* numbered by using an index letter (for what purpose, it is not clear) in addition to a number^ and the letter 'J' to indicate Judicial, should be closed and a new set of files started commencing with 'Jl'. it is unnecessary to place dash or an oblique stroke between 'J' and the number. The second file will be M J 2 ,, and so on. 6 . The state of the interior of some of the cupboards and of the steel cupboard leaves something to be desired. There is no objection to the Court clerk keeping his personal effects - cigarettes, etc. - in his office, but they should not be placed in the cupboard with the files. Stationery too should be properly arranged - not left lying about in untidy heaps. The steel cupboard might make a good store for it. Exhibits in cases should be carefully arranged in one place. There really should be a safe for them, and we ought to order one. Superintendent to take action. 7. There are practically never cases committed by the Indian Assistant to Sessions so that maintenance of register)^ therefor is needless. The one case entered therein,.'Bahrain State versus Minnick and Koch', should not have been so entered and a Sessions Cases Begister should really be kept by the Head Munshi as Sessions Court Clerk. He should take action. 8 . The Indian Assistant asked me if he could have another farrash and I think that he requires one. A.P.A. to take action please. /9. Regarding....Inspection of the Court of the Indian /ssistant . 1,4 if ' A'. GENERAL . 1* Previous Inspections. The Court was last inspected bv the political Agent on 6.10.45. The I. A. ft&amp;s initialled this report as 'seen' but there is no indication of compliance with any of the orders or suggestions in this, or most of the earlier inspection reports. / note should be made against each item of the report regarding action taken, including, when the case is pursued in the English Office, a note of the relevant file. I understand from I.A. that most matters referred to in the last inspection have in fact been attended to. with the exception of the safe recommended, efforts to procure which have not so far been successful. A safe is important, in view of the ease with which the record-room could be broken into, and the file should be obtained from tne Fnglish Office and put up to A.P. A. for further efforts. 2. Typewriters. The Arabic typewriter from Public Pelations office is performing useful work, but is also in considerable demand apparently in the Agency Vernacular Office. The wide-camage TTnglish machine supplied for typing statements is said to be so old as to be a standing loke; I was not able to verify this, as it had for the time being been borrowed oy the Public Relations Office. It will clearly aid effic iency is sufficient typewriters can be supplied to end this need for borrowing. # 3. Telephone. The present telephone in the I^A’s Court is an extension of the Agency office phone. This is not a satisfactory arrangement. It means that the I.a. is unable to ring up anyone without first sending a farrash to the Agency office to ask that the number shall be called, find pn the other hand, any call that does get through to him is at the mercy of anyone in the Agency office, who quite innocently and inadver tently, wishing to make 'a call himself and not knowing the line to be engaged t turns the generator handle thus cutting the existing connection. A separate telephone connection for the Court would tnerefore be a great convenience. 4. Forms and Registers. Records are in general neatly maintained and the Cqurt clerk was able to produce all papers called for without delay or difficulty. The position regard ing forms and registers does not seem to have improved however since the last inspection, when it was noted that all registers needed should be ordered without delay and in adequate numbers. Apparently presses in India, are unable to un^rtake this work due to shortage of paper, while costs of local printing are exorbitant and the work bad. Immediately necessary work has now been given in hand to local presses. For future supplies, I would suggest that there is justificat ionfor approaching the Government of India and asking either tii&amp;t arrangements should be made to print the necessary forms and registers in the Government of India Press, or that assistance should be given in supplying paper to an Indian commercial Press for this purpose. CHliiitinAL. 1. Summons and Warrant cases. Only 48 cases have been registered so far this year, none of which are now pending which is satisfactory. The register appears to be correctly maintained, except that in tne Orders column, no mention is made of the section of the law under which sentence was passed, or order of acquittal or discharge made; this should invariably be done. 2. Case No.24 of 1946. The record of this case was extremely hard to follow, owing to the pages having4filed in the wrong order. It would assist in the examination of case records if the pages were serially numbered from the beginning. 8. Case No.37 of 1946. This case has been wrongly recorded in the register as an acquittal, the accused being in fact discharged without any cnarge being framed against him. fin order of discharge should therefore have been made under section 258 oi the Criminal Procedure Code. The order of acquittal (sic) was made after hearing the evidence of P.w. 1, who testified that it was not the accused but another person - one Ghuiam - who had given him a bribe (the case being registered under section 161 read with section 116 I.P.C.) It seems on the face of it therefore at least possible that this Ghuiam was guilty of a similar offence; but there is no record on the order sheet of any inquiry having been ordered by the Magistrate, or of any other proceedings having been instituted. 4. Summary cases. Owing to laek of registers, cases tried by ?./h, /.?.end I /h are all entered in the one register. Fresh registers are apparently on order. If these are not available by tne beginning of 1947, x the suggestion made in previous inspections that cases heard by the three different Magistrates should be given separate serial numbers and entered in separate portions of the register should be brought into operation. Altogether 2W summary cases have so far been registered during the year, 12 before and 276 before I. A. Three or the latter are pending. A high proportion of these summary cases consists of offences under Motor Vehicles rules, in respect~^v c. - 3 - °f registrations, licenses etc. In none of the cases which T examined had the prosecution noted whether the accused was a first offender or not, a matter of importance in all cases, but particularly so in Motor Vehicles cases where a different scale of punish ment operates for those who already have a previous cpnviction. In view of the considerable numoer of tuese cases, I would suggest taat the introduction of ttie system common in India, whereby a ru^tine scale of fines for first offences is laia down and the accused allowed to compound for this amount without appearance in Court, might be considered for adoption. 5. Summary records. The present system, adopted doubtless in accordance with the remarks m para.5 of the unsigned inspection note at pages 10-13 of the Court Inspection file, whereby only the name etc. of the accused, the offence and final order, ere entered on the record, such remaining details as the accused's plea and a summary of prosecution and defence evidence being entered in the Summary Register, does not seem to me to be in accordance with the provisions of sections 263 and 264 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which lay down clearly what details shall be entered in the summary record - notably the plea of the accused and his examination, the grounds for conviction, and in cases where an appeal lies a brief judgement embodying the substance of the evidence. To assist in the last, the usual practice is to record a very brief summary of the principal prosecution and defence evidence, and the printed rorras of summary record in use in India include space for this, as for the other requirements of the above sections. I see no reason why these standard forms should/be .used successfully here, and would suggest that a stock of them should be obtained. 6. Pines Register. iS This/correctly maintained and initialled and a number of entries checked against the challan book and cases records tallied. ' CI VIL. 1. Civil suits register.

Court discipline is excellent, ^either civil nor criminal work is heavy, the former being almost entirely petty cases while the great majority of the latter are summary cases.

TP JW » M ^ H •-€ . for Political Agent, Bahrain./ hoce on Inspection of the Indian Assistant’s Court. The last inspection was made by Mr. Qlver on the 18th November, 1940. The following notes relate to the 1 . 2 . paragraphs of his report. A Godrcg safe has been obtained. A wide carriage English typewriter has been indented for. 3. A separate telephone connection has been provided for the Court. 4. All forms and registers required have been locally printed. Indents have been sent to the Government of India, but the forms have not yet arrived. Non-standard forms have been ordered from a printing press in India. CRIMINAL. Summons and Varrant Gases . In the register the expressions 'Crown”, 'State Police', 'Rais al Police' should all he replaced by 'Bahrain State'. Similarly, 'Director of Customs, 'passport Officer' should also be replaced; though the actual office of the person prosecuting in the cases should be noted on the file. There are no pending cases. Twelve cases have been tried since the beginning . of Che year. Case No .6 of 1947 . The sentence of Rs.200/- or 2 months’ rigorous imprisonment in default seems to me rather light for a conviction of receiving stolen property under section 411, Indian penal Code. Summary Cases . 110 cases have been registered during the year.- 2 - 7^ One register is maintained for cases in the Indian Assistant's Court alone. Cases are miscellaneous and majority do not now seem to be motor car cases. A routine scale of fines is now laid down. Su mma r y Records . The suggestions made in Mr. elver's note dated the 18th November, 1946, have been carried out, and the forms used for the record apj-ear to be correctly filled in. Fines Register . Correctly maintained. Civil duits Register . The Indian Assistant tells me that the columns under 'execution' and 'return of execution' are not required, and if this is the case, they should not have been printed when the forms were last ordered locally. Estates Register . A new clean register is in use. There are only five cases registered therein. Registers 'C* and '!)' and Ledger Form 'J «. properly kept. Re^lsc e r of Executions .

This typewriter is actually the property of P.R.O's office and is on loan to I.A's Court, There are no Arabic typewriters for sale in Bahrain; nor can any be obtained from abroad. , As this office work is more important than that of the I.A's court - in so far as Arabic correspondence is cencerned - there seems to be no alternative but to have this typewriter transferred to this office, and in case the I.A's staff happening to.require it they can cone and use it in this office. 3^' U 'Ms. F txr *~£— •jf l, «o Lj-x-Csl fv'Q' ^ L&lt;~ x CL^O_J&gt; ftoUi &lt;2-0 fud CUj^U^ (yjQ^ (XJ^ &amp; /vu^ &amp;-JL: ifiPlease let me have a list of the cases and suits pending in my Court and in the joint Court showing the nature of the criminal cases (Section of the I.P.£. etc#) and the value of the suits involved# This list should be put u£ with / } the most recent letter from the P.R. as to theprocedure to be followed in trying cases and hearing suits# ltd.

In view of the absence of pleaders here, I consiuer it essential that the original court should examine the parties and determine the points at issue between them in any case that is contested. This is mandatory under the Code of Civil procedure. 3. Article 36 of the Crder-in-Council prescribes that the Political Agent shall enquire from the several parties whether they desire that proceedings should be instituted in accordance with the Civil Procedure Code and the Indian enactments maue applicable to Bahrain, or in accordance with local usage, and shall record their replies. I hardly consiuer it necessary for the Political Agent to do this in person, and if the Judicial Assistant is trying a case as an original court he should record the statements of the parties under this Article. This might be done at the end of the examination referreu to in the,last paragraph. 4. Article 37 prescribes that when any of the parties desires that the suit shall be determined in accordance with tne Civil Procedure Code, the Court shall forthwith proceed to decide the suit accordingly as far as local conditions permit. This means that the Court cannot place all the if all the parties ask that the case should be decided in accordance with local usage, but I gather from Article 49 that it should ordinarily be referred to a Bahrain tribunal such as the Majlis at-Tijarah and that all the parties should be. required to engage in writing that they will abide by the decision of the tribunal concerned. Even so, I consider it desirable that the court should draw the attention of the tribunal to the points on which a decision is required, e.g., by the framing ofX issues, and that when the tribunal's decision is received the parties should be asked if they have any objection to it. 1 ' If the tribunal's decision does not cover the points at issue or is obviously unjust, the Court should refer the case back to the tribunal for further report, explain ing in some detail its reasons for doing so. 6 . If you have any comments to make on this letter I should be glad to receive them, otherwise would you kindly bring the point^made to the notice of the civil courts subordinate to you? responsibility on a body such as the Majlis at-Tijarah though it can presumably consult that body if it so wishes. 5.

If these qualifications to tne simple provision at Article 45(1)(c) are to be observed they will, I fear, greatly impair its considerable Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Lay K.C. _ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BkhitAlR •Copy cf J.A's ^ote: In the P.U.C. reference has been made to the following points:- ( 1 ) 1 o examine the parties and determine the points at issue between them in any case that is contested; ( 2 ) To record the statement of the parties as prescribed under Article 36 B.O.C.; (3) The Court cannot place all the responsibility on a body such as Majlis At-Tijarah; (4) The parties should be required to engage in writing that they will abide by the decision of the tribunal concerned under Article 49 of the Bahrain Order-in- council; (5) The Court should draw the attention of the tribunal to the points on which a decision is required; ( 6 ) When the tribunal's decision is received, the parties should be asked if they have any objection to it; (7) If the tribunal’s decision does not cover the points at issue or is obviously unj st, the Court should refer the case back to the tribunal for further report, explaining in some detail its reason for doire so. 2 . Regarding ( 1 ) above - This is normally one. ( 2 ) This has practically not been observed. The departure is presumably due to the fact that hardly a few of the pa ties know what is the difference between the procedure in accordance ith the Indian enactments and local usage. (3) A suit is referred to the Majlis At-Tijarah only when examination of accounts are involved for a report. The report is not confirmed unless the Court is satisfied that no injustice has been done. (4) Apparently Article 49 of the Bahrain Order-in- Council relates to suits gone direct to a Bahrain tribunal. The article deals with the fees to be paid to the proper Bahrain authority after the enforcement of the order of that tribunal. (5) This is normally done, but the ^ajlis and the Shara* Courts have their own way of hearing a case. They always start a case from the beginnir^ ( 6 ) A decision cannot always be to the satisf-ction of both the p*rties. There a e people who intentionally try to prolong the disposal of suits, but when the Court thinks thatthe decision is obviously Unjust the case is referred again to the tribunal for further report. (7) This is covered by No .6 above. In the majority of cases referred either to the ^qjlis to the Shnra' Courts, some sort of compromise is effected2 when they find it difficult to give a decision in the absence of evidence. Thus by a compromise they se‘tie a case in five minutes which would have taken months for the Court to decide depending strictly on the procedure. I think this has continued to be done having in mind the spirit of Article 10 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council.154/5/49 Please refer to your S.C. letter (154/4/49) V.S.C. 56-J31 of the 3rd April about procedure in civil cases* 2 * All references to the Bahrain Crder-in- Council in this letter are to the new Order-in-Council, 1949, of which you have presumably by now received copies* 3 * You informed me recently that the Majlis at-Tijarah is the same as the Majlis al-Urf. This is defined in Article 4 as 'h civil court based on not less than four members selected by the Political Agent in concert with the Shaikh of Bahrain'. Would you kindly confirm that the Majlis at-Tijarah is so composed? 4. Civil cases for the purposes of the Crder- in-Council fall into two classes, viz., 1 2 ( 1 ) those in which all the parties are subject to the Crder-in-Council, and ( 2 ) mixed cases. In class (1) it is obligatory on the court under Article 41 to enquire whether the parties desire that proceedings shall be governed by the Code of Civil Procedure or/by local usage and that their replies be recorded. If all agree that the case can be decided in accordance with local usage the court can refer it to a local tribunal for decision and no further action is required except if necessary to enforce the decision, e.g. it is not necessary to enquire from the parties whether they accept^the decision. If any of the . parties desire that suit^ should be determined under the Civil Procedure‘'•Code the court may under Article 42 refer the^question of local custom to the Majlis al-Urf for consideration and report. The court has then to take the report into consideration and in doing so, should in my opinion, obtain the views of the parties regarding it and must reach its own decision.No.C/R-172 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, The 28th April, 1949 Dear Sir Rupert, \ I confirm that the Majlis at-Tijaral is composed as stated in paragraph 3 of you] semi-official letter No.164/5/49, dated the 18th April, 1949.

C.J.pJ fu i9-12-49.w V i! ; H.M. Political Ag'entj i Bahrain, -Fh® systioni of collacting and accounting for judicial fees is irregular and unsatisfactory according to the standards prescribed by the Foreign Office. Ko statement of fee receipts equivalent to a fee cash book is Kept and there is thus no record of individual fees levied. The stamp book kept by the Court clerk merely shows the numbers and denominations of stamps which he receives from Mr Viswanathan on requisitions (Chalans) ana the amount of stamps used every day in respect of which the Court clerk makes periodical remittances of cash to the accountant. When a check was made on March 9th a comparison of the cash paid to the accountant plus cash m two pigeonholes in the Court office with the fee stamps in hand showed a surplus in cash of Rs 33 which is presumably derived from the under stamping of documents, though it may in part have been due to the clerk giving change out of his own pocket instead of out of fee cash. 2. Similarly the practice under which the Court clerk retains in a pigeonhole the half share of fees arising out of Joint Court cases, which is payable to the Bahrain Government, and pays it to the latter without this money passing through the official accounts, is highly unsatisfactory. 3. A proper record of all fees and fines collected snould therefore be commenced on the lines of a consular fee cash book. It should show the name of the person paying each fee or fine (or the name of the suit), the amount of the fee or fine collected, in respect of which judicial stamps have been affixed, and in a separate column the share of ary joint Court fee payable to the Bahrain Government, in respect of which fee starts have not been affixed. The attached sheet shows the form of record suggested in colunmar form. 4. The whole amount offees and fines collected including ary share due to the Bahrain Government should^be handed over daily to the accountant, the note of remittance showing separately any share eventually due to the Bahrain Government so that the accountant may enter this separately and post it to a separate ledger account which would be cleared at monthly intervals by payment of the amount due to the Bahrain authorities.
