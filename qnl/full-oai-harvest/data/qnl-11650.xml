This is based on two reports by Captain Munshi Fazluddin (Enclosures 2, and 3). It covers the reliability of Fazluddin as a source, outlines the lack of 'dynasty' in Aden, and argues against the basis of the Imam's claims.Enclosure 2: A brief outline of the history of Yemen during the Moslem period, by Captain Munshi Fazluddin, I M S, Political Office, Hodeidah, 1922.Enclosure 3: A note on the Zaidi Imamate of Sanaa [Ṣanʻā'], by Captain Munshi Fazluddin, I M S, Political Office, Hodeidah. It covers Sunnism, Shiaism and their teachings on succession, and divides the Zaidi Imamate in Yemen in to two periods for analysis: 902-1630, and 1630 to the time of writing.Printed for the use of the Colonial Office, March 1929.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>First Assistant Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imam of Yemen</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Inheritance and succession (Islamic law)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Dynasties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Protectorates</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0003dc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
