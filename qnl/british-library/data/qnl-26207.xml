It will 'be remembered that in connection with the oil negotiations the Sheikh of Q,atar was informed that H.M.G. would be prepared to grant him protection by land against major raids in the event of his granting an oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Partly with a view to the selection of landing grounds, etc., so as to be in a position to implement this undertaking, responsibility for which will rest with the R.A.F., and partly in order to impress the Sheikh, an air reconnaissance of the southern p*rt of the Qatar Peninsula was carried out on 9th May. As will be seen from the report the terrain of Qatar is extremely difficult and provides few places for aircraft to land. There is, however, a/' a fairly satisfactory site for a landing ground near the Sheikh’s Palace at Raiyan, a few miles west of Doha, and there are suitable anchorages for flying boats both at Dohat-as-Salwa on the west and at Khor-al-Odeid on the east side of the^Peninsula. The flying-boats landed at Doha, where they were met by His Majesty’s Ships ’’Shoreham” and 'Bideford', and on 10th May the Political Agent, Bahrein, accompanied by Group-Captain Saul, the Officer in Command of the reconnaissance, and by the Commanding Officer of H.M. S.’’Bidef ord n , paid a visit to the Sheikh of Q,atar. The Sheikh refused to allow aeroplanes to land at Raiyan, but the party were able to examine the site for the landing ground.INDEXED K^ An - secretT •' ' S.32797/Part i 4049 AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOU KINGSWAY.

The reconnaissance was carried out by one flight of No.84(B) Squadron (4 Wapitis) and 2 aircraft of No.203 (F^) Squadron, all of which operated from BAHREIN under the command of Group Captain R.I.Saul, D.P.C., working in close touch with the Political Agent, BAHREIN, who accompanied the flying boat reconnaissance. 3. The reconnaissance was carried out on 9th May, 1934, anc, in accordance with instructions from this Headquarters, the apitis flew from DGH£T AL HUBS IN via Port RAIYAB to DOHA smd thence via EAR ASHA to SAX# A. A report of this reconniiiesance is attached ae appendix ^A”. 4. The flying boats first reconnoitred DOH T AS SALIVA for a suitable alighting area and then crossed the peninsulni 1 rom SALWA to K1I0R AL ODEII) and reconnoitred the coast north to DOHA. A report of this reconnaissance is attached as appendix 'B'. 5. Tlie flying boats landed at DOHA where they were met by H.M. Sloops 'SHORESAM* and 'BIDEPCED”, aid on the morning of May 10th Group Captain Saul accompanied the Political Agent, BAHREIN, and the Officer Commanding H.M.S, tt BIDE ORD' on a visit to the Shaikh of Q TAR. Extracts from a report by Group Captain Saul, which mre contained in a demi- official letter, are attached as Appendix H C W • • 6. As a result of this reconnaissa ce it has boen learned that a fairly satisfactory site for a landing ground exists near the Shaikh** palace at Fort RAIYAN. about 7 miles west of DOHA. As explained in appendix u' it was not found possible to mark out this site or for Wapitis to land there ae had been hoped. From the air it a oeared that sites for landing grounds existed near KARASNA and SALWA but reconnaissance m the ground will be necessary to decide whether this is correct. A s regards flying boats the foot | of DOHAT AS SALWA near SALWA Wells is quite suitable for flying boats except when the 'shamal' (north wind) is blow ing, and in those circumstances flying boats could take ENCL 08 U Tlie Secretary, Air -iiniatry, Adastral House, King*way, London, No. 26.

Subject:- R. rORT A flight of four Wapitis left JfOHARRAft at 0205 hours O.M.T* on 9th May, 1934, tc make a reconnaissance of the southern central area of the QATAR PEK INSTIL A. The reconnaissance commenced at the southern end of DOHAT-AL- HTJSSAIN at 0244 hours O.M.T. Copies of photographs taken will be forwarded as soon as possible, a list of them is contained in Appendix 'A'. 2* An approximate course was steered for RAIYAN and DOHAR. One aircraft flew at 6,000 feet for the purpose of carrying out vertical photography. Conditions, however, proved unfavourable in most places due to the presence of a mist haze laying at approximately 1.000 feet. The other three aircraft flew between 500 and 1,000 feet for purposes of observation and oblique photography. 5. The peninsula appeared from the air to be hard sand with hummoc ;s, and plenty of camel-thorn and bushes round which soft sand had formed mounde large enough to prevent a safe landing over almost the entire stretch of country. The whole area ie covered with dried water holes and there are several patches green with grass and trees, so that water appears to be near the surface in ver/ many places. 4* A small encampment was passed, about three miles south-east of DQHAT-AL-HUS.-AIN • Another camp of several tents was seen a further three miles on this course. Course was then altered to approximately north-east to regain the original track. £• On reaching OHAFAT ei$it tents, including one white one, were observed. The three low flying pilots were of the opinion that GirlAFAT was approximately seven miles couth east of its position as shown on the sketch map. 6* One mile to the north of CKAFAT were sixteen to twenty tents and a car |a van). Thero were apparently no wells in the immediate vicinity of this camp. A few miles to the west a well-marked car track was first seen. Which ran from OHAFAT to RAIYAN and DOHAH. were seen at WAJAIBAH, about three miles west of RAIYAN. Photographs were taken of this and also a piece of apparently flat ground sli$itly norths The latter was considered fit for converting into a landing ground. 7 A large well, ruined buildings, gr&amp;ez and trees8* RAIYAK hag pie ty of mter, and the i^iaikh^ summer residence has beautiful and well-kept gardens, water being pumped up by a wind-driven pump* A stretch of ground about a mile cast of RAIYAB on the DOHAH track (slightly green) with . grass) was considered fit for landing on, as far as could I be ascertained from the air. The ground was searched in the immediate vicinity of DGHAH, but no area fit for landing on was noted. Vertical and oblique photographs were taken of RAIYAH and DOHAH, also the track connecting them. 9. Course was then set from R \IY AN to KARA 1 AHA. On the north-eastern half of this track several water-holes were observed, but none on the south-western half. 10. At KARA* 1 ANA a good well was seen, with a few buildings nearby. Immediately south of these the area, it was considered, would foimi a good landing ground provided labour was employed to clear cajTiel-thora and small bushes. Another area also considered as a possible landing ground was observed one nile-south-west of KARA*MA. 11. At SAB-SAB, approximately 2 miles south-east of KARA*AHA, un area of greenery, containing a fairly large well, was observed to have sunk considerably. 12. Prom KARA 1 AHA the course to SALWA was over an arid and rocky area, on which It would be extremely difficult to execute a successful forced landing. At SALWA, south of the coast, wore scattered groups of trees, beyond which were vI extensive mud-flats. These appeared to be suitable to land M on. Ho ruined fort or deserted buildings, or signs of occupation, as noted an the sketch map, v/ere seen hereabouts. 13. From SALWA the aeroplanes returned to HUHARRAQ. 14. The reconnaissance lasted 4 hours 20 minutes. (Signed) S.F.VINCENT. Squadron Leader, Commanding, Ho.84 (Bomber) Squadron, Royal Air Force. Shaibah.($p@&gt; Appendix 'b' . fe COPY.

DUHAT HAMAR is an inlet approximately 1 # 000 yards long by 400 yards wide. It is sheltered on all sidoa # out extensive shoals which limit the area for the operation of fl^rinr* boats. It is not considered that a flying ooat w°nld &gt;e able to taxi from DUHAT HAilAR into DUHAT-AS-SALWA tO take off otfim to the mouth of the inlet being extr emely^shallow and obstructed by sand banks.

At $AI$A there is a small inlet approximately BOO yards by 300 yards wThich is shallow and full of sand banks and is definitely unsuitable for flying boat use. (b) Eastern Coast . On 9.5.34 S.1435 carried out a reconnaissance of the eastern coast of DUE 'T- S-SAXWA from KHOR FAIoHShAIhFT to SAX?/A Wells. The coast which appeared to differ considerably from the chart was sketched and is* shown on the attached tracing.

Provided permission was given I intended to mark out the landing ground with some lime I had brought for the purpose, and for one of the Wapitis of 84 Squadron to carry out a trial landing* However, the J^naikh’s son called on the S*H*0* on the afternoon of the 9th and apologised for the absence of his fatlier, who, he said, was sick, and had gone but into the country to a place named A! viuhaib, which is some 35 mlloe H*H*I* of Doha, loch expressed his concern about the Shaikhs illness, and off erred to take the Ship’s doctor to see him, but we were immediately assured that it was a minor illness and that he would be all right the following day. Having called this bluff, we then made arrangements to visit the Shaikh at A1 Quhaib at 0600 hours on the morning of the 10th. Next morning the Shaikh sent two cars, one with escort, and Colonel Loch, Captain Browne of the IT Bideford” (as, the S.N.O, had departed for Henjam the previous day) and myself proceeded to Al Quhaib via Riyan, passing the proposed landing ground en route. e found the Shaikh looking very healthy ?*id fit, md after discussing everything but the landing ground for some time. Loch eventually suggested the possibility of one of our aircraft landing at Riyan to test the landing ground. The Shaikh immediately became animated, and refused the request, having Ms reasons ready, stating that he did not want aircraft to land at Pdyan, as there was no need for it and he feared an accident, for which he night bo held responsible. Further, he said that when he had come to some agreement about the oil with the Companies concerned, and with us for protection, he would be prepared to let aircraft land, but I gather that this should not b© construed into a definite promise.. After further discussion he did eventually, though somewhat reluctantly, tgree to us exandning the landing ground at Riyan on the way back to Doha* /The 4The general iiiipression I got at the Conference was that he expected to be aeked to allow our aircraft to land in his territory, as his reasons against came out pat, and obviously other influences had been brought to bear on him* and he was playing for time* Loch thinks that his attitude was definitely less strongly against the idea of the landing ground than it was previously# After an exceedingly heavy rabic lunch at B a#m. we started back to Doha, and half way back discovered we tvere being taken by a different track which missed the landing ground. Whetner the driver had instructions to do tills is a matter , of conjecture - we in isted on going back to the road we came by' md eventually stopped and oxa&gt;nlned the landing ground site* The country in general consists of undulating stony desert, with occasional patches of thorn, but the site in spected is a long shallow depression in Which water probably stands after rain* This has produced a mud seepage Which has hardened, making a very good landing surface of hard mud, no crust, and will take all types of aircraft* It is about 600 yards long and 200 to 300 yards wide in places, with the prevailing wind up and down* There are a few jackal holes, and care should be taken to avoid them unless they h«v© been previously filled in* The main Doha - Hiy n track runs across the site, but is not an obstruction. X am inclined to think that the fact that the proposed site for a landing ground ia, so to speak, outside the Shaikh^ own front door, influenced him in his refusal, and if it were possible to obtain another site further away he might more r adily agree, I kept a careful eye for any other likely site, but saw nothing. As I said, the general nature of the country is undulating stony desert, and it might be possible to select a site ner Doha, where labour is available to clear the stones, but it would be a biggish Job*(• 5 ^) 11 — 2534 ) Wt. 1987*^-958 15.000 10/33 T.S. 118 A.M.

Ifso ought a caveat to be entered in general terms at your next interview?

Particularly if it is broached by the Sheikh, the fiesident will be in a position to take the line that, while the matter must be referred to H.M.G., they will obviously be anxious in the first place to ascertain what difficulties are involved in the grant of protection, and for this purpose it would-be possible for him to obtain the consent of the Sheikh to reconnaissance flights of the nature which you suggest. As the result of these reconnaissance flights, which need not, I imagine, take very long, it would presumably be possible for the Air ach final conclusionsvas to the landing grounds which they would require in the event of a guarantee of protection being given. The connected question of intelligence istsrrirsey one for settlement between the departments concerned in consultation with the Political Resident t *^ 5.

If the Sheikh is offered and accepts our protection we assume that no difficulty would arise about the provision of refuelling facilities. Detailed arrangements in regard to the provision of labour for the making or improvement of landing grounds could be a matter for local agreement.

As far as sites for landing grounds are concerned, the following are either mentioned by the Air Officer Commanding in his telegram or have been mentioned in previous reports Doha ffaish Shahh . Suitable area observed from the air for a 3. We shall not of course require all those landing grounds but as it has never been possible thoroughly to examine Qatar with a view to finding landing grounds, Doha Site for emergency landing ground exists 7 miles west of Doha and mile east of Port Riyan.

Mentioned by the Air Officer Commanding in his telegram but regarding which no information is available. COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL Q fW ^our information on the subject is rather meagre, and it is- suggested therefore that in dealing v/ith the company care should be taken to allow as much scope as possible for future developments, in other words, that our hands should be left as free 9 . 3 ..possible to increase or extend our* facilities 4-f, found necessary at a later date* In this connection it is possible that the suggested♦wording of the safeguarding clause (5) in the G-overnment Agreement, mentioned on page 2 of Walton's letter, which says 'any sites which may have been selected' would not give us a sufficiently free hand to extend or increase air facilities, if it should eventually be necessary to do so. We discussed this point recently and ’you agreed it should be possible to arrange for wording of this clause in a manner which would meet both the Company's and our requirements. Will you please let us know what you would suggest? As far as can be seen at present our requirements will be limited to two landing grounds. • (a) Doha if it is found to be good enough, or failing that the next best alternative, as our main landing ground. (b) Karaana, if one can be found there, or alternatively some other advanced landing ground in the vicinity of that place. I am afraid v/e cannot define our requirements more precisely than this until it has been possible to carry out a thorough reconnaissance on the ground to examine these and possibly other likely sites. Perhaps you would consider the possibility of our being given permission to do this. 4. We understand you are now considering the desirability of offering the Sheikh a guarantee of protection against external aggression in exchange for concessions on his part, and if anything comes of this it will be essential for us to be given an opportunity of examining likely Sites on the ground (xor landplanes and flying boats) before committing ourselves definitely on the subject. Any change in the existing policy, which added to our commitments in the matter-3- of protection of Qatar against external aggression Y/ould *lso involve careful consideration of the problem of intelligence. As you know, the success of air operations depends very largely upon efficient intelligence, and we normally (in Iraq for instance) provide our own Intelligence Officers. Apart from other considerations our concurrence in the acceptance of additional commitments in Qatar or elsewhere in the Gulf, would certainly depend to a considerable extent upon arrangements being agreed to for the provision of such , additional intelligence facilities as might prove necessary. I merely mention this point at this stage so that you may take note of it, and it need not delay progress with regard to general policy. 5. In his most recent telegram the Air Officer Commanding raises certain additional points, as follows (a) That sanction is required to fly over Qatar at all times without the need for obtaining prior permission. We, of course, fly over Qatar when we wish to do so now but it might be advantageous to cover this point in any new treaty or, agreement with the Sheikh. It might be done on the same lines as already arranged for Bahrein, Koweit, etc. t (b) The Air Officer Commanding asks that he may be allowed to establish refuelling facilities at Doha. This should, we think, apply to any landing ground which we may acquire and might in fact, be extended to allow us to put down any accommodation we may require or to provide any stores including, if necessary, armament (bombs). In this connection it might also be useful if the Sheikh was required to provide any necessary labour to make or to improve our landing grounds, and to guarantee their safety. It is possible some small sum would have to be paid for this. As far as protection is concerned, under ordinary circumstances this would• V • merely entail prevention of damage to landing grounds and safeguarding any fuel or other stores v/hieh we might put dovm. Exceptionally it mgfrt necessitate provision of guards when aircflTo carry out occasional 'brief visits to Qatar for inspection purposes or go there for any operational purpose. We cannot, of course, indicate at this stage to what extent, if any, we would be prepared to rely upon local natives as guards during the exceptional occasions referred to above, (c) The Air Officer Commanding asks that fuel, oil, spares and Service material shall be admitted to Qatar duty free and we think that this is a point which might well be covered in any agreement with the Sheikh. * (d) Apother point raised is that the company shall be required to provide free facilities for ! Service aircraft at any landing ground which they may make and it would be advantageous if this , could be arranged. 6. We agree with the additional qualifying clause which you propose adding to the last sentence of article 5(A) in the , Koweit Commercial Draft Agreement, in order to safeguard the position under the aircraft agreement which is being proposed to the Sheikh of Koweit, but suggest addition of the word 'civil” before 'aircraft' in the penultimate line of page 2 of Walton T s letter to me P.Z.401/24 of 18th January, 1934. « f * 7. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty, and Starling at the Petroleum Department. Yours sincerely.p.a.401/34. India Office, Whitehall, S.7/.1 16th January 1954 With reference to Laithvjaite letter of 9th January, P. 2*154/34, you ruay like to know the present position in regard to the grant of oil concessions in Qatar to the Wnglo Persian Oil Company and in Koweit to the Koweit Oil Company (controlled in equal shares by the Anglo Persian Oil Com nniy and the Gulf Company of the United States of America). commercial side of the proposed concessions should be embodied in an agreement between the Company and the Sheikh concerned, which would not come into force until parallel agreernents between His Hajesty 1 s Gcvernment and the Cornpany concerned have been concluded. The safeguards of British interests which we require will be embodied in these Gove rmne nt ag r e erne nt s. and some progress has been made in discussion of them with the Companies. I enclose copy of Article 7 in the draft commercial agreement respecting Qatar, and of Article 5 in the draft commercial agreement respecting Koweit. With a view to safeguarding, inter alia, the position in regard to future requirements of air facilities, vie contemplate that each Government agreement should contain clauses on the following lines:- It has been decided in each case that the The commercial agreements are already in draft, Wing Commander V7.A.iicC1 aughry, Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kings way, .7.0.2.TT 5. Notwithstanding anything contained in the agreement between the Company and the Sheikh of Q.atar Koweit the Company shall not have the right to use or occupy, and shall not include in the areas selected ror the purposes of its operations, any sites which may have been selected by or on behalf of the Sheikh or His Majesty’s Government as being required for aerodromes or for aeroplane or seaplane bases, or in connection with the development of harbours, or for wireless and telegraph installations. 6 , The operation of wireless, telegraph and telephone installations, if any, maintained by the Company shall not interfere with the operation of such wireless, telegraph or telephone installations as may be established under arrangements approved by the Sheikh or His Majesty’s Government”. I imagine that the question of possible future air requirements may be more important in Koweit than it is in Qatar, but, subject to your views, a clause on the above lines ought sufficiently to safeguard the position, presumably, however, it will be necessary to select alternative sites for possible future requirements before the Company commences operations. With reference to the last sentence of .Article 5 (A) in the Koweit commercial draft agreement, we propose to suggest the addition of a qualifying clause to the following effect: ’’Subject to any regulations of general application for aircraft made by the Sheikh”, in order to safeguard the position under the aircraft agreement which we /3. vje are proposing to the Sheikh of Xevjeit (see our letter of 11th August P.3.4434/33 and connected correspondence).a A T A Pi . * COUBBCIAL AGREr^raiTT. •'yi * ije Article 7 .

My dear Laithwaite, °V7T, lW Rj' MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY. W.C.2.- January, 1934. if With reference to your letter PZ.8215/33 of the 2lst December, 1933, the Air Ministry are not at present greatly concerned regarding air facilities on the QATAR PENINSULA owing to its close proximity to BAHREIN, and the present arrangements, under which the Sheikh has been warned that he will have to account in the event of occupants of an aircraft which may have a forced landing coming to any harm, should meet our requirements for the time being. 2. It is desirable, however, that in due course we should have an emergency landing ground either at DOHA or in the vicinity of DOHA FAISH SHAKH where air reconnaissance has indicated it might be possible to establish a landing ground. As far as can be foreseen at present it does not seem that we are likely to require more than facilities for emergency use by both Service and civil aircraft and for this purpose one, or at the most, two landing grounds should suffice, preferably near the sea for ea6y communication. It would perhaps be best, however, that we should avoid specifying particular sites in dealing with the company, or even the number of sites we might require. 3. As we have to look some 75 years ahead we should also perhaps consider the possibility of a change of policy under the terms of which H.M.G. might go further than at present in the matter of guaranteeing Sheikhs on the Arabian coast against external aggression, and if anything of that sort came about we might then require more elaborate facilities in QATAR, i.e. stocks of fuel and perhaps bombs together with some COPY SENT BY AIR MAH. ofI greatly increase our commitments in the Gulf, if at all, as the mere Icnowledge that we were prepared to support Sheikhs under our protection would probably prove to be a sufficient deterrent. In any case this contingency should not necessitate the provision of landing grounds, additional to those mentioned in paragraph 2 above, but only accommodation, fuel stocks and bombs. 4. As far as the A.P.0.0, draft lease is concerned, I do not think we are much concerned except for this question of safeguarding our present, or future, air requirements and it should not matter a great deal whether a clause is inserted in the lease to cover the point or whether it is done by means of an exchange of letters. It is for the political and legal authorities to decide how best our requirements can be safeguarded. Incidentally if the A.P.O.C. obtain a concession they will probably establish a landing ground of their own, and would no doubt be glad to obtain revenue by allowing Imperial Airways to use it. 5. There is one other point which I think I should mention at this stage, in connection with wireless telegraphy It is important that in the event of a W/T station or stations being erected on QATAR that the wavelength should be chosen to avoid interference with R.A.P. or Imperial Airways communications, and the Air Ministry should, therefore, be gp-fcin jil itkim 8 of any proposals of this description. C&lt;mSuM*&lt;£ ‘U+coiaC Co - Yours ,—INDIA OFFICE, //. WHITEHALL, S.W.l. Confidential. Dear Mr .Hearn, 29th December 1933. The revised draft of the concession which the Anglo-Persian Oil Canpany are anxious to secure in respect of the State of Qatar which was communicated to us at our meeting with you and Mr.Fraser on the 11th December has now been examined by the Departments concerned. As you will see from what follows there are certain points on which we are not yet in a position to let you know in detail the views of His Majesty’s Government. But we are anxious ^o facilitate and expedite so far as possible the course of your negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar and we hope what, even if further discussion is necessary between the Canpany and the representatives of His Majesty’s Government on certain points, the information contained in this letter will give you a general idea of the position, and will enable you to give the necessary instructions without delay to Mr.Chisholm. 2. Procedure. We should like in the first place to make certain suggestions as regards procedure. You will remember that in the course of the discussion on 14th December the attention of the Company was drawn to His Majesty’s Government’s desire to safeguard certain matters such as air, wireless and telegraphic arrangements, the relations of the Canpany with the Sheikh and the local representatives of His Majesty’s Government etc., and the suggestion was made on your side that it would be preferable that matters such as these should not be included in the actual agreement between the Canpany and the Sheikh and that they might equally A.C.Hearn, Esq., Angl o-Persian Oil Company, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, S.C.2. satisf act orily/2. satisfactorily fce disposed of by an exchange of letters between the Company end His Majesty’s Government. As the result of further consideration we now think that the simplest course would be that there should be two agreements, the first between the Company and the Sheikh, the second between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. The Agreement between the Conpany and the Sheikh would be essentially a commercial agreement which would deal with commercial points only and would not include anything of a purely political character. It would, however, contain a clause t* the effect that it should not come into force until His Majesty’s Government had given their written consent to it. This would be in accordance with the Sheikh’s treaty obligations and difficulty should not therefore arise so far as he is concerned in agreeing to it. Subject to this and to the modifications discussed below such an agreement could probably be substantially identical with the 'revised drait agreement’ which we are now considering. 3. The proposed second Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company - the completion of which would be a condition of the approval of His Majesty’s Government to the first, or Commercial Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh - would cover points of special interest to His Majesty’s Government. We think on the whole that a 1 ormal agreement would be a more satisfactory method of dealing with these questions than an exchange of letters, though on the understanding that legal effect could be given to any undertakings embodied in an exchange of letters and that such undertakings would be binding on any assignee, transferee or subsidiary ccmpany formed to operate the Qatar concession, as well as on the original concessionaire, we should not regard the/the question of form as one of vital importance. The matters which His Majesty's Government, as at present advised, contemplate that such an agreement would cover are set out in paragraph 5 and following helcw. I ought to make it clear that it is intended that the conditions to he embodied in this Agreement would he conditions which would apply not merely to y cur Company or another British concessionaire, hut to any company, of whatever nationality, which may endeavour to secure an oil concession in Q,atar. 4. Amendments in 'revised draft concession '. For convenience these have heen set out in the enclosure to this letter. Save in respect of Article 12, on which, as you will remember, it proved impossible to reach agreement at our discussion on December 14th, and of a suggestion on Article 2, they are substantially identical with those which were th*n provisionally agreed between us and which you have already communicated to Mr. Chisholm, though there are two or three points of minor importance which were not included in your c cramunicati on to Mr. Chisholm and which, according to our record, were discussed at our meeting. 5. Content of special Agreement between Anglo-Persian Oil Company and His Majesty's Government . I now turn to the question of the matters to be included in the special agreement or exchange of letters referred to in paragraph 3 above between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. As already explained the requirements of His Majesty’s Government under this head will apply equally to any company, whatever its nationality, which may seek to obtain an oil concession in Qatar. As you will appreciate, certain of these matters involve c onsideration/4. consideration of points of some difficulty on which it will he necessary to consult the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf before His Majesty’s Government can reach a final decision. Partly for tnis reason, and partly because in the short time at our disposal it has been impossible to be certain that we have exhausted the various aspects of the matters in question, we propose at this stage to indicate them only in general outline. ue will in due course, and I hope before very long, let you have a statement in greater detail and possibly in a form suitable for inclusion in an agreement of the nature which we suggest, and we shall, of course, be ready to discuss matters further if on receipt of that statement the position seems to you obscure in any respect or there are any points you wish to raise. 6. We are anxious in the first place to secure an understanding that any sites which His Majesty’s Government may select for aeroplane or seaplane bases in Qatar in the future (at the moment there is merely an informal arrangement in regard to a particular landing ground at Dohah) shall be secure from interference. As was mentioned in our discussion on 14th December an undertaking of this nature has been given by the American interests which are operating the Bahrein oil concession. The understanding would equally apply to hare ours in the perhaps improbable event of His Majesty’s Government deciding at a later stage for any reason to develop a harbour in Qatar, and it would be necessary also to cover the question of wireless and telegraphic communications. 7. Secondly, as you will remember, we have emphasised in the discussions which we have had on the question of this/5 this concession the very special political conditions of Qatar. As you knovj, it is practically unexplored hy Europeans; its hinterland is unadministered t its people are bacirA'ard, scattered, and unfaiailiar with the elements of ordinary western civilization; danger of serious political trouble, responsibility for dealing with which would fall bach on His Majesty 1 s Government, in connection with the Company’s activities in so far as these might either cause misunderstanding on the part of the local inhabitants or in any way affect religious or similar institutions or buildings, cannot be overlooked, and a further complication arises from the fact that the boundaries of the State of Qatar are undelimited. His Majesty’s Government regard it as most important in these circumstances that there should be a clear understanding with the Company (which would, of course, extend to any assignee, transferee, or subsidiary company working the concession) that they will undertake to pay due deference at all times to the wishes of the Sheikh (which His Majesty’s Government will on their side see are not unreasonable in character) and to the advice of the political representatives of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, whether stationed in Qatar or not. 8. Thirdly, while we are not yet in a position to make a positive proposal to you on this point, it is not improbable that His Majesty’s Government as at present advised will require provision to secure the same degree of British control as has been discussed with you in the case of the parent or of any transferee Company, in respect of any subsidiary companies operating the concession, of the nature embodied in sub-clause 1 of the tentative redraft of Article 12 of the revised concession which you drew up at our/our meeting on December 14th. In particular it/will he regarded as essential to secure that the concession is operated locally by British personnel exclusively. Provision would also have to be made in regard to the nationality and position of the Chief Local Representative of the operating Company (this would of course include the question of the channel of ccmmunication between the Chief Local Representative and the Sheikh), the refining of oil won either locally in Qatar or in British neighbouring territory, and the right of pre-emption in time of war. These are all matters which can, we think, best be included in a separate agreement between the Conpany and His Majesty’s Government which would be communicated to the Sheikh but to which he would not be a party: and we feel that, other considerations apart, such an arrangement may facilitate the task of negotiating a commercial agreement with him. 9. I hope the information contained in this letter, incomplete or provisional in character as it inevitably still is on certain important points, will meet your purpose. If there is anything on which you are not clear, perhaps you would be so kind as to let me know. I should be grateful if you w r ould let me know the views o^ the Company on the procedure suggested, and if you would confirm that they are prepared to accept the amendments to the 'revised” concession set out in the enclosure to this letter, and also the understandings subject to which certain amendments have been inserted or omitted. On one lurther point, which was mentioned in the course of our discussions, I ought perhaps to put on record that while the draft Agreement, with the modifications and subject to the supplementary Agreement proposed, would in present/t 7. present circumstances be generally acceptable to Kis Majesty’s Government, it would of course be understood that they are not ^ permanently ccmmitted to the terms in question and that should the present negotiations between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Sheikh break down, or any other material alteration in the situation take place (such as the appearance of a competing company) they must reserve themselves full liberty of action.V V P.Z.8329/33 &amp; Note of amendments proposed in 'Revised Draft Concession' communicated unofficially v +he Anglo-Persian Oil Company oo the representatives of LLis ilajesty 1 s Governmen at^ the India Office on the 11th December 1 c )?&gt;7) Preamble. Article 1 . Article 2. No comment. No comment. (a) If the position of air etc. facilities is safeguarded in the separate agreement or exchange of letters between the Company and His Majesty’s Government referred to in paragraph 3 cf the covering letter it* will be unnecessary to make special provision in this article. (b) It is understood th./t the words 'or such normal extensions thereof as might be indicated by the Sheikh' refer to rehgious lands and religious buildings. The following redraft is suggested to make the position clear:- ”or such normal extensions of such religious lands, cemeteries, or Duildings t as the Sheikh may indicate....' (c) In addition to the amendments above we should like to suggest the omission of a reference to a map, at any rate at this stage-, The precise boundaries of dD-tar are at the moment under investigation by xhe political authorities. It is hoped that a very early decision '..ill be reached regarding them and a map can best be produced and attached when agreement has been reached on this point. The point could best be met by the omission of the words '(as shown/o ^ • she/n generally on the nap annexed hereto)”, (d) The Conpany have agreed to omit the words at the end of tie first sub-paragraph TT and any subsequent extensions thereof.” Article 5. The Company agreed to consider amplification of this article on the lines of Articles 12A and 13 of their Persian concession, subject to certain verbal modifications. We suggest that the article might be revised to read somewhat as follows:- ”3. The Company shall make a thorough investigation of the State of Qatar by such methods as may in its opinion best enable it to ascertain its oil possibilities. In carrying out its operations under this Agreement the Company shall employ all means customary and proper and shall exploit its Concession by methods in accordance with the latest scientific progress. ”fhe Company undertakes to keep accurate of wells drilled pl ...ns, maps, records /and such other data whether topographical, geological or of drilling sruoir as it is customary to keep and such material shall be open to inspection by che Sheikh or his duly authorised representative ”fhe Company shall supply an annual report to the Sheikh of its operations under this A gre ement.” Article 4. It was agreed on December 14th that so long as (a) the financial terms to be given to the Sheikh under this article were such ■ ■■ ■ ' •3 as to give full weight to the fact that the Company would obtain an exclusive concession over the whole area of Qatar, which appears ■fS to be rather over 2,000 square miles, without specific drilling obligations or without any definite obligation in the event of oil being proved to proceed to commercial production within a given time, and (b) the Sheikh fully understood that the effect of acceptance ofthe royalty formula pro posed would be that royalty would have to be paid only on oil actually exported from or sold for consumption in Qatar and not on the oil production, no modification of this article need be suggested. Article 5, No comment. Article 6. In the 5th line of the Article the words 'as it may require' appear to have been omitted. The Company agreed at the meeting on 14th De c emb e r (a) to insert the words 'subject to the pro visions of Article 7' after the word 'right' in the first line ofthis article; (b) to insert at the end of the first sub- paragraph the words 'but not otherwise' after the words ,f for the purposes of its operations'; (c) The question of a special safeguard in respect of telegraphic and wireless installations v/as discussed in connection with this clause. We do not wish to press that this should be specifically covered in the Commercial Agreement with the Sheikh so long as it is understood that it will be included in the separate agreement to be concluded between the Company and His liajesty 1 ^ Government. (d)/(&amp;) On a separate point, the Company’s representatives were very reluctant to agree to any specific safeguard for the political interests involved or for the position of the Sheikh in the clause, and the suggestion was made that it might be possible to meet the difficulties felt by the interested Departments ox His Majesty’s Government by an exchange of letters in which the Company would undertake to give all due deference to the views of His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh in the exercise of their rights under this article. To this we understood that the Company’s representatives agrees and so long as it is understood that the point will be covered in a separate agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government we do not wish to press for its insertion here. (a) So long as the safeguards desired by His Majesty’s Government in respect of air facilities etc. are dealt with in a separate agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company, no modification of she first sub-paragraph of this article to cover this point will be necessary. (b) The Company h:.ve agreed to insert ’’with the consent of and' after the words 'leased by it' in the opening sentence of sub-paragraph 2. .Ye suggest on a point of drafting that in the same sentence the words 'but the terms of such purchase or lease shall not be in excess” etc. should be substituted/substituted for the words ,T but such conditions Article S. Article 10. Article 11. Article 12. shall not be in excess. 11 Sub-paragraph (i). Second sentence. The Company have agreed to insert the words 'subject to the sane conditions'. In connection with this article it was understood at the meeting on the 11th December that the Company would see no objection to the addition of a provision in this article or perhaps more appropriately in Article 6 to the effect that the Sheikh 'shall have the right to use harbours utilised or constructed by the Company, provided that such use in no way hampers the Company or interferes with the safety of its operations.' It was agreed in connection with this article that there could be no question of acceding to the Sheikh*s request that rifles should be supplied by the Company. At the meeting on 14th December Hr.Hearn, after considerable discussion, suggested the following redraft, which might, he thought, be acceptable to the Iraq Petroleum Company, but beyond which he was not prepared to go:- ' Article 12 . The Company shall have the right to transfer this agreement 1 d any other British commercial company, but not to any government, subject to such Company being able.to fulfil all the duties and obligations of this, agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh if it so transfers this agreement. Such other commercial company shall be and remain/(55) 6. remain : British company, registered in Great Britain, having its principalplace of business in Groat Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times be a British subject.' 'The Company shall be at liberty to form one or more subsidiary companies under its own control should it consider this to be necessary for the working of this concession. Any such subsidiary company shall, so far as they are applicable to its operations, enjoy all the rights and privileges granted to the Company hereunder, and shall assume all the engagements and responsibilities herein expressed, except the engagement expressed in the final sentenc-e of the preceding clause.' The redraft in question has been further considered by the interested Departments of His majesty 1 s Government. Their position in regard to British control, British exploitation, the position and nationality ox the Chief Local Representative, etc. in any oil concession in Qatar is referred to in paragraph 8 of the covering letter, though, as there stated, they are notyot in a position to set out their minimum conditions in so many words. So far as the commercial agreement between the Company and the Sheikh is concerned they would however be content to accept as Article 12 the xirst two sentences of sub-paragraph 1 of Mr.Bearn’s redraft and sub-paragraph 2 of the seme redraft less the words 'except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of tire preceding clause' and to omit any reference to British control from the comne rc i al/7 . commercial agreement mith the Sheikh °o long ae it was understood that the question would be covered in a separate agreement between H.M.G. anu the Company. On ^ point of drafting, it is suggested that the word ^Agreement” be substituted for the word ''Concession'' in the first sentence of sub~para.2 of the redraft. article lo . The Company agreed, subject to discussion with the The 11 Company, to the insertion in sub-para 2 of a provision that '’producing wells or borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working'* and to make a corresponding amendment in substitution for the words 5, in such working condition as the property then is*' in sub-para. 2.and 3. We have not yet heard the result of their discussion; but we note that Article 20 (ll) and (ill) of the revised Persian Concession requires wells to be handed over in good order ana that there appear to be no lack of precedents for a provision of this nature (e.g. in the Brunei concession, which is operated by the Shell Company, Clause 19 reads: !, 19. The Lessees shall (save in respect of any operations of which the Lessor shall have sanctioned the abandonment) at the end or sooner determination of the said term deliver up to/8. 1*\ to the Lessor in good order repair and condition ana lit for further working all productive wells cr borings which shall have been made by the Lessees urder the liberty and power in that behalf herein before contained.. 11 ; while the Iraq concessions both of the I.P.O. and the British Oil Jcvelopment provide that “the Company shall maintain in good working order all wells drilled so long as they arc economically productive.”) Article 15. It was suggested to the Company, who, it is understood, saw no objection, that the words “the period of such delay, together with any such period as may be nccessarv for the restoration of' might be amended, in the interests of the Sheikh, to read “the period of such delay together with such period as may be reasonably necessary, subject to the approval (or in the view) of the Political Besiuent, for the restoration, etc.” Article 16. It was made clear at the meeting on 14th Boccmbcr that attached importance to the restoration of the Political Resident in substitution for the Court of International Justice as the person to be responsible for nominating the third arbitrator. It was understood that the Company saw no objection to this. H.MBl., while attaching importance to the modification, see no objection to the Company lc3 postponing communication of it to the/% 9. the &gt;heikh until their negotiations with him have reached a more advanced stage. When such a communication is made they arc equally willing that the Company should inform the Cheikh that the modification is made at the request of H.M.C., who have intimated that it is in accordance with the practice in other Persian Culf oil concessions and that they must make it an essential condition of any concession granted to any company. tio 1c 17 . (a) I'he Company agreed, in the second sentence of the article, to add ihe word “suitable 5 * before the word “labourers 1 * in line 5, and to delete the words “ur demand unreasonable wages. 11 (b) ihuv have also indicated that they would welcome the exercise of jurisdiction by HJh.l. and that they are not prepared to accede to the lheikh f s request that he should exercise jurisdiction in disputes between their employees and his subjects. The question of jurisdiction is one which can most suitably be decided in direct discussion between the Sheikh and If necessary a reference can be made to the position in the agreement proposed between the company and H.M.G. (c) The question of the nationality of the exploiting personnel arises for consideration in connection with this article./10. Article. This, as indicated in para.8 of the covering letter, is a matter which, in the view of H.LI.Cr., can most suitably be covered in the agreement to be reached between them and the Company, and on the understanding that it will be disposed of in that connection thev do not desire to suggest any modification of the terms of the article. It may, however, be placed on record that the American interests which are operating the Bahrein oil concession have agreed to a provision in respect of the employment of British personnel. Article 20. It is understood that the Company propose to stand out for an Arabic and an Bnglish text.

OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 21st December 1933. iify dear McClaughry* I write with reference to our recent telephone conversation to say that the A.P.O.C. are now pressing on with their endeavours to secure an oil concession from the Sheikh of Qatar in respect of the whole of his territory. A copy of a revised draft concession which they have recently communicated to us informally is enclosed. 2. as you will see, the draft contains no provision to safeguard our position in respect of aerodromes, present or future, in QEitar. We are, of course, in the difficulty that at the moment we have no regular aerodrome, but merely the emergency lanaing ground which has been marked out with bags of chalk consequent on the Sheikh* s refusal to give us the facilities we want. But ■ Company's as the/concession, if they succeed in getting it, will Wing Commander W-.A* McClaughry, DSQ., MC., DFC., Air Ministry, Auastral House, fiopv op.it qv «m Kingsway, W.C.2. run/y - 2 - run lor 75 years, here, as in Bahrein, it may he desirable to safeguard the future so far as we can without delay. 3. We mentioned the point to the Company in a discussion which starling and I (on behalf of the other departments concerned) had with their representatives here on the 14th December and suggested that a specific safeguard against interference with such aerodromes as we might establish in Qatar should be inserted in Article 2 of the draft concession. The Company were very reluctant to agree to this, but ultimately indicated their readiness to consider dealing with the point in an exchange of letters. 4. The draft agreement raises various important questions of policy and will necessitate further examination of the general safeguards which it might be thought desirable to ask the Company to agree to (either in the concession itself or in a subsidiary agreement or exchange of letters between and the Company) as a condition of our consent to their proposals. We should be very grateful in these circumstances if you could let us/us know as soon as possible, even in the most general terms, what your views are as regards future air requirements. If, by any chance, consequent on the grant of an oil concession to the A.P.O.C. (or any other competitor) we has to reach a general agreement with the Sheikh on questions such as jurisdiction ana trie maintenance of a political representative in Qatar it might well be that the opportunity would be a convenient one to dispose of the question of air facilities. 5 , I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty, and Starling at the Petroleum Department.

The gist of it is as follows. 2. (a) He wishes to see me on the subject of air facilities, but Government should give him the assistance he previously asked for, over and above the undertaking given by them (Government) to support him within the limits of his State. In other words his demands art the same as before. (See paragraph 4 of Political Agent, Bahrain* s letter of 20th August which formed an enclosure to my letter of 26th August,) These demands are quite unreasonable and have been refused by His Majesty’s Government (Secretary of State*a telegram No,2241 of 27th August). / 5v r(b) A* a corollary to his demands for assistance he refers to certain tribal elemebts who are hostile to him and wish him harm* (c) He is pleased with the remark in my letter that if an aeroplane lands in his territory and is well treated* he will be rewarded* but is grieved at my warning that if hostility towards it is shown he will be called to account* (d) He makes the usual reference to the 'freedom / of nations', which la the fashionable cliche amongst Shaikhs nowadays* 3* X do not intend (more especially as I understand ths matter is not urgent} to visit the Shaikh with a request for air facilities which will probably be refused, ( in which connection please see my letter Ho*762-S of 12th October, para graph 3), but I do not think that a friendly visit - if I can fit it in - would do any harm, and should the Shaikh during this visit raise the question and abate his demands, I shall be willing to discuss it with him* 2 enclose a copy of a reply which I have sent to the Shaikh* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India and the Air Officer Commanding, ’Iraq Command* I I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd/- T, C. Fowle, Lt.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*■ British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the &amp;Lo i October 1932. H.K.Shaikh Abdullah bin J&amp;sim al-Thani, C.I.E.,Ruler of Q^atar, £ a t, a r_. After Compliments, I have received your letter of 7th Jamadi-as-Thani 1351. I note that in return for the air facilities required by His Majesty's Government you still adhere to the previous demands which you made to Captain Prior, Political Agent, Bahrain, when he visited you in August, i.e., a new treaty between yourself and His Hajesty's Government similar to the treaties which the High Government lias with Bahrain and Kuwait. These demands the High Government cannot grant. All that is wanted from you, as our friend Captain Prior carefully explained to you, is an emergency aerodrome, which is only required in case of accident, and on which an aeroplane may not land from year’s end to year’s end. You state that you would like to hold a conversation with me on the subject 'fgpPWSBH®!&amp;0Y A30- 2 - aubjeot of the air facilities required. But if you persist in your demands then an interview between us to talk over this subject is useless. As# however, I have only just become Political Resident and have not yet met you, I should like to pay you a friendly visit some time if X can arrange it, but as you know I have many claims on my time. In conclusion I must repeat the warning given in my letter of 20th Jamadi-al-yali, 1351. j This is what had to be said, may you be preserved. i i - - * ^ B sd/« T.C.Powle, * Lt.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Ho flnde It difficult to retreat fron the position ho has taken up, and will only do so—-unless under threat of oompulslon —under oover of exorbitant demands. Unfortunately two oases of such rebuffs to offloors have occurred m the last two nonths: to the Political a^ ent, bahrain, at ^atar, axkL to the Political Agent, Muocat, at aalfea. 3* In order to aYdld, If It Is practicable, such Incidento In the future X propose, when air—or other- facilities are required fron shaikhs, to adopt a procedure used with some success in areas outside the Gulf where 1 haYe served: to find out beforehand by weane of unofficial —or denl-offlclal—'repreeentatlvee* Hhat reception the Shaikh concerned Is likely to give to the proposal. An Arab Shaikh, is wore likely to reveal—in tut flrat instance at all events—the tortuous vorklngi of his Arabian mind to a fellow Arab than to a hritlah officer, unce these pre~ liainary soundings have been taken, and 1 an wore or less au felt with what is the iihaikh's attitude on tin subject, as well as that of hie relatives and trlbeanen, the questioner sending a Political officer to open official negotiatlcne can ♦ b&lt; considered.

X would have preferred the representative to have proceeded by himself unatr no official auspices whatever, but it is certainly much better that he should reach Kalba somehow than not at all.

The original Air Ministry letter of 29th July, No. 3.31413/36, ; of which copies were sent to Bushire by the nail of 4th August, stated in-frho firot plaGo that an emergency landing ground was required at Dohah on the strategical air route and added j 'This emergency landing ground will also prove useful for civil aircraft flying along the Persian Gulf route.' In consulting the Foreign Office on this (as you will have seen from our d.o. letter of 6th August, No. P.Z.4559/32, of which copies were sent you by the air mail of 13th August) we I lemphasised that the Air Ministry remark was 'a misapprehension,-for our clear understanding is that the route for civil aircraft will he direct from Bahrein to Shargah and that they will not fly the strategical route hy Qatar, etc. But it must, of course, he recognised that an emergency landing ground in Qatar might on occasion prove useful in the event of an accident to a plane on the civil route or of a forced landing'.

I hate the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter Ho, C/160, dated the 20th August 1952, from the Politisal Agent, Bahrain, reporting on his recent visit to ^atar to negotiate with the Shaikh of ^atar for the establish ment of an emergency landing ground in his territory. 2» With reference to paragraph 1 of Captain Prior's letter 1 should explain that he carried two letters from me to the shaikh, one limiting the support #f His Majesty's Government of his authority to 'within Wthe town of Dohah', the other extending it to 'within ■the town of Dohah and along the coast of ^atar', Cafi aln Prior had discretion to present the latter if the former was not likely to be acceptable to the shaikh, and did so. 5, with reference to paragrajsti 10 of Captain Prior's letter, I agree with him that it would be in- a - v l ocj.ule at present to attempt to bring pressure on the 3halkh by threatening to cancel the 2^ re-export concessloi A from/from Bahrain. 4. while the ahaiJch's preeent demancle are quite 7 reasonable (the terms of protection offered him by His Majesty's OoTernment were fully adequate), it is possible that in some amMm he may retire from his recalcitrant position, and in this connection I venture to point out that the longer time there is available for negotiating with a shaikh on my any particular subject the more likilihood there is of a successful conclusion. Arabs dislike intensely being hurried, and if a shaikh is asked to say yes quickly, he will generally say no—even if it is to his distinct advantage to say yes. Moreover no shaikh is an autocrat: he is generally little more than primus inter pares , and before he can give a decision has to consult his relatives, and other influ ential members ef his tribe, all of which consumes much time. Zt is obvious that in the present instance the Shaikh of qatar felt he was being 'rushed*• 'He (the shaikh) replied that the matter could not be settled like this. There should have been writing between him and the Resident, several times, and the Resident should have come to hohah and they would have discussed clause by clause what his help was to be, and what his liabil ity'. Yet under the circumstances of the case, as the commencement of the Arab Air Route was imminent, an immediate reply from the Shaikh was essential. I m sending copies of this despatch and of its enclosure to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India and the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq Command.

I pointed out to him that ho had himself told me that he had no objection to the landing ground provided that he obtained some support from His Majesty’s Government* Fow that they had agreed to give him the support how could ho eat Ids words? He replied that the natter could not be settled like this* There should have been writing between hin and the osident,several tins*s,and the Resident should have con© to Dohah2, Dohah and they* vrould have discussed clause by clause what Ills help vas to be,and \shat his liability,and finally,a paper would have been mad© with the seal of the Kingof India. (The Viceroy?). 3. I explained that ( avermaont did not make formal treaties over so small a matter as an emergency aerodrome,v/ii 0 re a piano might not even land from years and to years end,but ho shook his bead and said that it was all the same if it landed once or fifty times; his tribes would not understand it and wa&amp;d take him to task. All he would say when I pressed him was ’Ana akhaf’ ’I dursn’t 1 . He asked for time to consider the matter,and I offered to wait a oouplo of days,but he said that he would give me a reply noxt day. 4. Next morning he gave me a letter fbr the Resident ,whioh I read and found to say that he had nevor agreed to the aerodrome and could not do so for fear of his tribes. I reminded him again of his very different statement on my last visit.but he would only mutter ’Ana akhaf ^ Later he said ’If Government want this they must protect mo completely as thqy have done at Bahrain and Kuwait’. Jhen ho mentioned the clause restricting the support to trouble that arose out of air facilities. ’God know what this was,it might be a mouse or a camel’. I .saw that it was useless to v/ait any longer and took the letter and went. 5. It will be soon that his attitude lias now deteriorated, nd that whereas two years ago,when i first reoorwtemed securing tiie aerodrome it could have been easily arranged,and that two months ago he was agreeable subject to son© degree of protectioi he will not now agree unless placed on the same footing as Bahrain and Kuwait. I beiiovo his attitude is genuine for he has never mentioned any financial consideration,or had such a suggestion conveyed to me. His control over his tribes is slight and he is always afraid that Bin Jiluwi,tlio powerful jairAmir of Haaa my inoito them against him and this gradual expansion of our aorial intorosts has undoubtedly aroused increasing alarm* 6. A visit from you mould,I fear,produce no useful result, for ar^r discussion would inevitably disclose more fully how limited the help we axe offering i8,and there is no hope what ever that he will agree to^in its limited form. In fact I had realised that my errand would be fruitless the moment I read the letters. It remains to oonsider what is to be done. I outlined the possibilities in my telegram of the 17th August and have little to add to it. 7. If Riyan,(b miles west from Dohah) ,\&amp;ioh is the only possible aerodrome for miles around,is essential,it will hare to be narked without the dhaikh^ cooperation,a proceeding which will be both arduous and difficult in this weather. It appears, I however,that Im erial Airways obvious route is down the western shore of the alar . eninsula and that they will pro bably cross it somewhere near the ilior Ode id. Phe chart is a t —- far better guide than the map to the actual coastline,and should be studied in preference to it. The western side of the j enin- sula is far more level than the eastern side and moreover this route will give them the shortest sea crossing. 8. Too much weight should not be attached to security. Thaikh Abdulla has little control over his tribes in any part of the peninsula,but so far as I have soon thoir numbers are tfftaii and they are of a peaceful disposition and most unlixely to attack a giant aeroplane.

The best course, after discussion with the Air Ministry, seems to be to let matters stay as they are for the present, but to mark the Riyan site with bags of chalk, even though these ipay be removed by the Sheikh’s people,and to issue to the Sheikh, as soon as begin to fly over Qatar, a w*pnvr\n t of the type suggested by the/ 415b 3000 10/31the Political Resident and accepted by the Government of India.

We also agree with Resident that we should not be justified in coercirg Sheikh by force, though without his co-operation it would seem hardly possible to secure adequate or permanent marking of the emergency landing ground. Markings dropped from the air would certainly be removed unless under SheiklRs protection We can only suggest that Resident should make another attempt to persuade Sheikh if and when he considers the opportunity favourable, and perhaps hie hand might be strengthened if he were authorised to offer some annual payment for the maintenance or rental of the landing ground.

(iv) Dohah was visited on 8th April, the Shaikh of Qatar was absent but his secretary politely declined permission to examine the area for an emergency landing ground. The point was not pressed as it was thought more desirable to return with the Political Resident or Political Agent, Bahrein. A further visit was made on 14th April by Squadron Leader Fletcher accompanied by Captain Prior, Political Agent at Bahrein, and a site for an emergency landing ground was found seven miles West of Dohah and a quarter of a mile East of Fort Riyan, the Shaikh of Qatar*s summer residence. The site is small - approximately 400 by 400 yards and the whole surrounding country is undulating, rocky and covered with large stones. A large area was flown over both on this occasion and on 8th April. A few small holes require to be filled in to make the ground available for use. Water is available. A rough sketch is attached at Appendix ’’B'. Photographs could not be obtained owing to thick dust, they will however be taken during the next visit to the Persian Gulf.

As a result of discussion with the A.O.C., Iraq, they are now in agreement with the A.O.C. that an emergency landing ground will he required at Dohar for the purpose of the strategical air route between Basrah and Muscat. It will he remembered that this air route will run Bahrein-Dohah-Yas Island-Abu Dhabi-Shargah. They further luaisaita that such a landing ground might prove of value for civil aircraft flying along the Persian Gulf Route and the A.O.C.'s telegram of 15th July goes so far as to refer to the fact that civil aircraft will be flying between Bahrein and Yas. The Air Ministry, with whom this has been discussed, agree that the A.O.C.'s the result of a misapprehension, for the civil air route will run direct from Bahrein to Shargah and will not touchf ■ ' v '—'—^ —• H ItohaKt On the other hand they point out that an emergency landing ground at Dohak might he of value in the event of forced landings or other difficulties on the civil route. 2..

Accepting thei: view that it is necessary from the strategical point of view and potentially useful from that of the civil air route, the quid pro quo recommended hy Sir Hugh Biscoe is set out in paragraph 5 of his despatch of 7th June. The Sheikh is to agree to allow us to establish an emergency landing ground on the site selected, to put down the necessary landing marks, and to provide transport on payment for the carriage of 12 b requisite material. We in return are to undertake to support his authority within the town of Dohafr should these measures bring upon him the hostility of his relations or people. In the last resort we may agree to grant him in the same circumstances our support, 'along th e coast 11 and not merely within Dohak itself. No guarantee of succession is to be given. 3.

I have the honour to state that during discussions with the Hobble Political Resident in the Persian Gulf concerning the air route along the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf it was represented to him that it was desirable both for the benefit of Royal Air Force landplanes and of Imperial Airways aircraft that an emergency landing ground should be established between Bahrein and Yas Island. A suitable site has been observed from the air to exist about s even miles from the village of Dohah cn the Qatar Coast, and an account of a visit paid to the Shaikh of Qatar by Group Captain W.L. Welsh DSC. AFC. in connection with this landing ground is contained in his report on a reconnaissance carried out by him in April last (reference 2 033/l 32/Air) of 28th April 1932, para. 26 (iv)) a copy of which was forwarded to the Air Ministry under cover of my letter S.10604/1 dated 26th May 1932. The Political Agent, Bahrein visited the Shaikh of Qatar during May last and the Political Resident has forwarded the report of the Political Agent, together with his own covering remarks, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in a despatch Ho. 37l/s dated 7th June, 1932. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Secretary of State for India in London. In this despatch the Political Resident, after describing the sort of undertaking which he suggests should be given to the Shaikh of Qatar in return for the use of the emergency landing ground, asks that he may be informed whether he shall proceed with the negotiations for the use of the landing ground. I now request that the India Office may be informed that an emergency landing ground at Dohah is definitely re quired and that instructions may be issued to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to proceed with the negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar.

We have always considered it desirable that an emergency landing ground should be made available on strategical air route between Bahrein and Yas Island. There is no other place where landing could be made between these two places. We consider this even more desirable now that civil aircraft as well as service aircraft will be flying over it. Galpin of Imperial Airways has made similar representations. For similar reasons we have recommended that emergency landing ground should be made available on Hasa coast. Although not essential these emergency landing grounds are obviously desirable in order to give added security in ease of adverse winds or dust or engine trouble.

Bir, I have the honour to state that when I was at Shargah in May last I waSjinfomed by an offiwer of the Royal Air Force that Imperial Airways would re ed an emergency landing ground in Qatar when the civil air route was transferred to the Arab coast. I accordingly asked the Political Agent, Bahrain, to approach the shaikh of Qatar on the subject, and Captain Prior was flown there a few days later in a flying boat. The visit, however, was a very brief one and time did not je mit of any detailed dis- ddssions. Subsequently Captain Prior has again paid a visit to Qatar, and X forward herewith for the information of the Government of India a copy of a despatch received from him on the subject. 2. It will be seen that the Shaikh of Qfttar asks in return for the concession for standing ground that he should be given some sort of guarantee of support and protection. I know from personal experience thatjhe is a most difficult old gentleman to discuss matters with and has the utmost reluctance to defining exactly what he wants, and he has retrained from doing so in the presamt instance. I think, however, that what he really desires is support againt his relations/2 relations, of whom, lilos all the Truoial Shaikhs, he appears to stand in considerable apprehension. 3. fe entered into treaty relations with ^atar in 1916 ehen the treaty was negotiated by Sir Percy Gox. In paragraph 7 of his despatch ho. T.16, dated the 4th 'I was prepared in connection with the negotia** tion of this Treaty to be asked by Shaikh Abdullah to take action against his disaffected elder brother Shaikh Ahalifah, but their relatione seem to be a little more satisfactory at present. I offered, if Abdullah wished, to send for Khalifah and give him a homily and a warning, or to write one to him, but the Shaikh thought it was not necessary at present, but said he would ask for such help later if the circumstances made it unavoidable. He thought Khalifah's line of action would be, not any open opposition, but the incitement of ftifeimMtai bedulns to harass (&amp;tar ao as to discredit his (Abdullah's) ruleV It is to this the Shaikh presumably refers when he said that he could not understand what Government's mMsmbb objection was to giving him the assistance which he might never have to ask for and that sir Percy Cox has been on the point of entering into such an agreement with him but that the matter had not been finally settled and that since the days of Colonel Trevor it had not been revived. I do not know of which particular relative the Shaikh is apprehensive nowadays, but his present request seems to be similar to that which he put forward to sir Percy Cox. 4. It may not be out of place to summarise briefly our recent dealings with qatar in connection with air facilities. In this connection 1 would Invite a reference to my letter Ho. 285-b of the 26th June 1930, in which I reported that the Royal Air jforce wished to reconnoitre Dohah in qatar and also Yae Island for possible landing grounds, and recalled that Sir Lionel Hawarth had expressed November 1916, to the Government of India, Sir Percy Cox wrote: the view that the shaikh might be brought to agree if we undertook•3- © ® v&gt; »[ gjoi l } i ! i- h (fjfut ^ ‘ * und«rtook in return to give him protection by land and guarantee hie auooeeeion. In that letter I stated that whils I had not then seen the shaikh I was in principle averse from any offer to guarantee successions and with this view ■ e 8o\ (. rnraent of Indi a expressed their concurrence* The Shaikh was subsequently interviewed by the folitioal Agent, Bahrain, and later by nyself, and again put forward some indefinite requests for support, but I was later informed 'M, by the Royal Air SOrce that as they had established a ^fuelling tank at Yas Island, they did not desire any further facilities at Dohah and the matter was dropped. It has now been revived on behalf of Imperial Airways, but I have not received any offioial instructions on the nubject, a:xi ohouid sUd to be informed whether it is considered ncoeseary to have an emergency landing ground in natar. I* so, then i think it will be necessary to pay the price that the Shaikh asks and to give^im some sort of letter of support. I doubt if in practise this would commit us to very much ami it would seem more a question of evolving a formula than of anything else. Actually the presence of the •ivij. air route on the Arab coast must involve us in certain commitments and a greater degree of interference in the affairs of the shaikhs through whose territories it runs than has been customary in tins past. It is primarily because the Truolal shaikhs realise this themselves that thrre has been so mu* resistance againet^the grant of air tan lilies. Ab captain Prior points out, the projected aerodrome is four or five mile, inland and w. are dependent upon the Shaikh for transport for any work that we nay under take there, and secondly, aircraft landing there wUl^ in distress, and it is es.e„tial that they should receive the ready cooperation and assistance of the local ruler, and thi is not likely to be whole-heartedly forthcoming unless ws have acceded to hi. demands in respect of support.-4- 5« I would suggest therefore tJmt I should endeavour to obtain from the Shaikh a letter in which he agrees to aJJow us to establish an emergency landing ground on the site selected and to put down the necessary landing marks and to provide transport on payment for the carriage of the requisite materials f etc., and he should na add that in return for those facilities he hopes that the British Government will afford him their support in the event of these measures bringing upon him the hostility of his relatione or people. 1 would reply thanking him tof the permission granted and say that in return the British Government undertake to support his authority within the town of Bohah should his apprehensions prove true. The Shaikh may try and extend the support to his coast line, i*e. # to change the words *withln the to wi of &amp;ohah M to 'along the coast*, and 2 think wo should accept this if necessary, but 2 would try and limit our support to the town of Dohah in the first instance. Prom idiat the iPoliticrii Agent, Bahrain, reports, the Shaikh Ntt realises that we do not wish to be involved in adventures in the interior and would be quite satisfied with support along the coast. 2 am strongly opposed to any guarantee of succession. The rule of primogeniture does not exist anywhere along the Arab coast and the invariable custom is that on the death of a Shaikh the ruling family assemble to elect a succesafer, and the normal result As that the strongest man succeeds. It is in our Interests that this should be so, and we certainly do not want to be committed to supporting the claims of a weak ruler who hae not been accepted either by his relations or his people. As a practical issue it seems to me exceedingly unlikely that our promise of support would ever involve us in any action. If the relatione of a Shaikh wish to oppose him they do not organise an armed rebellion and besiege his fort or anything of that sort: on the/-5- (59 the contrary, they seek to nur#or him secretly and iuddenly t and all would probably be oyer long before we oould oone to the eupport of the Shaikh* I imagine that the Shaikh will regard our letter much more ae a safe guard against being murdered than anything else, since his relations would fear that his murder might inyolye our armed intervention. If the Government of India and His Majesty's Government approve of my suggestion I will arrange for the itolltical Agent to proceed again to ^atar at an early date to discuss the natter with the shaikh. X am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of state for India art to the Air Officer Commanding Baghdad. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (SiGituaj; h. v, uiscoE, Lieut,-CoIons1, Political Resident in the i?ersian Gulf.^ '' ' ; No. C/82 of 1932. 'v / ; ‘ : J:~ Political Agency, Bahrein* Bated 30th May 1932. From The Political Agent, Bahrein. To The 200*010 the Political Besi&amp;ent in the Persian Gulf* Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to say that I visited Doha and raised the question of the emergency landing ground with His Excellency Shaikh Ahdulla. I had not found it possible to proceed to his camp in the desert im- -mediately on arrival owing to lack of transport hut was able to discuss the matter freely with his secre- -tary, Saleh bin Mana, before going out there and had heard what Sheikh Abdulla's views were likely to be. The Secretary's forecast proved entirely correct. 2. The Shaikh said that he did not object to the idea of the aerodrome out that he, on his part, also wished for something and that was further support from Govern- -ment of some kind or other. I told him that he had raised this matter before but that he had failed to give any accurate description of the support he required, and that Government had not seen its way to meet his wishes. I asked him whether his idea was to strike a bargain with the Government, the emergency landing ground being on one side of the scale and the support wanted on the other If this was the case, I suggested that he had not fully realised how little it was that Government was asking. He replied that he quite understood what was required2 ■but that what he himself wanted was also a very slight matter for Government, and a mere letter from them giving assurance of support would be all that he re- -quired. 3. I argued the matter with him for the whole morning but he would not move from the position he had taken up, which was, that in return for the land- -ing ground, he wished to receive a greater degree of support from Government than he received at present, b-e said that his control of the peninsula was not great and that his tribes and his family might take him to task for having granted the landing ground. I replied that this argument might ring true in the mouth of a minor Trucial ohaikh but that I ventured to doubt that he really meant it seriously. He then said that he could not understand what Governments objection was to giving him the assistance which he might never have to ask for. He said that Sir Percy Gox had been on the point of entering into such an agreement with him but that the matter had not been finally settled and that since the days of Colonel tir kcuL iijet (M-tK xcuLm A , ru*. Trevor A he noticed a weakening in tne “ siyasat “ of Government, whether it was that the policy itself had changed or that individual representatives altered it, he could not say. I again pressed him to define exactly what he wanted and he again expressed himself surprised that I should be unable to grasp what was required. He said that he might wish for help in protecting his borders. This, I immediately replied, Government would not hear of. I then asked him if it was Bin Saud that he wished to be protected from. He denied this but said that his control over the tribes in the3 in the peninsula was slignt and that they oould easily he persuaded hy underground means to act against him* His family also gave him trouble from time to time hut the mere visit of a sloop would he enough for any purpose. What he wanted was a letter to show people that he had a hig friend behind him. I told him that Doha had a had repu tation for slave trading and that the abolition of this would undoubtedly he demanded if a new treaty were entered into. He replied that he certainly would not he able to move in such a matter without a great deal of support, as it would rouse everyone against him. He asked what Government's objection was to promising him assistance when they were al- -ready hound to do so much hy treaty. I replied that Government considered that a ruler should he able to rule and that they would only involve them- -selves in difficulties hy intervening in the inter nal affairs of rulers who had no power to fend for themselves. His Excellency rose at this and said **Eh! and where would Shaikh Ahmad of Kuwait or Shaikh Hamad of Bahrein he now if it was not known that the British were behind them?' 1 M Both,' 1 he said 'would have disappeared long ago.' This is, of course, per- -fectly true. 4. I asked His Excellency to give me his reply in the form of a letter. He said, however, that I was now fully informed of what was in his mind and that since the query had been a verbal one, the reply to it should also he verbal. I mentioned at this point that the refusal of the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Sharga to grant facilities had not been accepted and in each case Government had been obliged to ignore them. His Excellency said that if Government chose to forceforce him, he could not resist them hut if they wished him to agree willingly, I had heard his reply* I told him that he already received a considerable degree of support from His Majesty’s Government and enquired where he would he if, for instance, we did not protect him from Persian en- -croachment hy sea supposing they should desire to use their new warships for this purpose. His Excellency's reply was interesting. He replied immediately that he would come to terms with Bin Saud and he added somewhat nervously that he pre- -suiaed he would receive notice from us of the con- -clusion of our present agreements, and as for Doha itself, it had heen moved several times before and could he moved again and destroyed and rebuilt again. There was plenty of room in Kasa and they could go anywhere. 5. I continued the discussion with his 3ecre- -tary throughout the long afternoon and it seems that His Excellency would accept an undertaking from us simply to help him to maintain his position in the town of Doha itself. Without this he was un- -willing to agree of his own accord to the landing ground, although his last words to me were ' Tell Government what I have said and we will see what they mmm say.* 6. In my letter No 172/C of the 2nd August 1930 I advanced reasons for extending our control over Q,atar for this very reason, as it was quite obvious to me that we would require landing grounds within it borders, but my suggestion was not accepted. I still adhere to the views then expressed and I do not see how we can expect the Shaikh to maintain the somewhat onesided friendship that exists at presentpresent and an occasional present of a Pale of cloth is a very slight return for what we ask of him from time to time. We are constantly calling on him to punish his subjects for acts committed against Bah- -rainis and others and it was not so long ago that he was obliged to burn a boat belonging to some of his subjects who were engaged in piracy. If, he should at any time find our pressure and our relations be- -coming so one sided as to drive him onto the arms of Bin Baud, the results would bejieplorable both from the points of view of aviation anu. our relations with the mainland. Unless Bin Baud is prevented by pres- -sure elsewhere it would be as easy for him to absorb Qatar as it was to absorb the -^sir. Also the numbers of Persians in his territory is increasing and the possession of warships may tempt them into giving assistance to their fellow' countrymen. 7. I personally consider that the Shaikh should be given a letter saying that we are prepared to do what is reasonable to assist him in maintaining his position in the town of Doha and I do not consider thaL we would incur a heavy responsibility thereby, w'e constantly interfere in the affairs of Trucial shaikhs and even deport their relations and I see no reason why we should shrink from similar action in ^atar. As I have said before I consider the visit of a sloop would be all that is required and there is no portion of the town of Doha that is out of range of its guns, since the new sloops are able to come within a few hundred yards of it. 8* it is considered that this landing ground is not of sufficient importance to warrant any concess- -ions on our part, the Shaikh should be informed that GovernmentGovernment do not consider the landing ground suf- -ficiently important to offer him any guid pro guo and that they intend to proceed with it without his cooperation. The Shaikh cannot of course oppose this hy force hut since the aerodrome will he some five miles inland hy his fort at Biyan, difficulty will occur in obtaining transport for workmen, tools and cement and in undertaking the work without his cooperation. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, SB/- C.G.PBIOB. Political Agent, Bahrain.^ \ X CONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE p^gg; APPENDIX. Precis of the Treaties and Engagements between the British Government and the Chiefs of the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. KOWEIT. (a) Agreement dated 23rd January 1899.—The Sheikh pledged himself and his neirs and successors not to receive the Agent or Representative of any Power or Government at Koweit . . . without the previous sanction of the British Government . . . and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage or give for occupation or for any other purpose any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power, without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. (b) Letter from Lieut.-Col. Meade, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 23rd January 1899, accompanying (a)The Sheikh was formally assured “of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors as long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond (i.e. the agreement above).” Xote.— In 1911, when the text of the Agreement of 1899 was com municated to the Turkish Government, the text of Col. Meade’s accompanying letter was not similarly communicated; but the Turkish Government was told in Sir E. Grey’s covering note that “His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The attitude adopted at the time by His Majestv’s Government towards this undertaking is illustrated by the following extract from India Office letter dated the 30th October 1911 to the Foreign OfficeThe term ‘ good offices ’ . . . is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-2, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression will moicover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises.” (c) Agreement of the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 24th May 1900 to prohibit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from, Koweit. (d) Postal Agreement, dated 28th February 1904, giving His Maiestv’s Government the sole right to erect a post office at Koweit. ^ (e) Secret Agreement, dated 15th October 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore.-In the fifth article of the two documents constituting the agreement the Sheikh reaffirmed his pledge not to cede sell Ac., any Koweit territory to any foreign Government or foreign subiect without His Majesty s Government’s permission. In the ninth, the British Government promised that “the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to . . . the Sheikh of Koweit and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mubarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs, &lt;Sc., and his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands ol Sheikh Mubarak-ae-Subah, ruler o! Koweit, and his heirs after Note.— The lease, or rather the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site, was terminated in 1922. It does not appear, however, that the agreement was abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges, so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments, presumably remain binding. 3376 50 1.29 P. 2585/26. P. 4525/11. P. 1446/11. A-) (/) Pearl fishing and Oil.—The Sheikh undertook in 1911 not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foreigners save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government. He gave a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. (g) Letter dated 3rd November 1914 from the Political Resident to the Sheikh, in which the Sheikh was given, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, certain assurances of which the third was that “ Kovveit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (h) The undertakings given to Sheikh Mubarak were renewed in 1917 to his son Jabir, and again, on his accession, to the latter’s successor, his brother Salim. To Salim, who proved troublesome, Government in 1918 gave a warning that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour. (See Memorandum on Koweit on page 76, para. 20.) (0 In a Kharita delivered on 19th July 1921 the Viceroy renewed to the present Sheikh, Ahmad al Jabir, nephew of Salim, the assurances given to the latter. BAHREIN. atchison, Voi. xn, (a) In 1820 the Ruler of Bahrein subscribed to the general treaty with p ' 172, the Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf, which prescribed abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea, from slave traffic, and from inter-tribal war, and peace with the British Government. (The adherence of Bahrein to this treat}’ gave the British Government a formal right to intervene, as it did in 1863, between Bahrein, Abu Dhabi and Katr, and again in 1867-9.) (b) In 1817 the Sheikh of Bah rein subscribed to an engagement for the Do., p. 178. abolition of slave trade in his ports and for the submission of Bahreini Do., p. 158. vessels to search by British cruisers for slaves, and to seizure if guilty, and in 1856 signed a further engagement for the better suppression of the slave trade. D °-&gt;p-159. (c) On the 31st May 1861 Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa signed on behalf of himself and his heirs and successors a “perpetual treaty of peace and friendship with the British Government.” In Article 2 he agreed to abstain from maritime aggression, war, piracy and slavery by sea “ so long as I receive the support of the British Govern ment in the maintenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of this Gulf.” In Article 3 he undertook to refer to the arbitration of the Political Resident cases of aggression by sea on Bahrein or Bahreinis and to refrain from retaliation without the Political Resident’s assent. “And the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury ... by sea upon Bahrein or . . . its dependencies.” d&lt;»., p. 162 . (d) On -ind December 1880 Sheikh Isa signed an agreement bindin 0, himself and his successors not to enter into negotiations with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the British Government, and to prevent the establishment of diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots, other than British, without the consent of the British Government. “This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.” Do., p. 163. (e) On the 13th March 1892 Sheikh Isa signed a further agreement the first two articles of which reaffirmed his undertaking to abstain from relations with foreign Governments; in the third article he undertook “ on no account to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory save to the British Government.” (/) In 1898 the Sheikh of Bahrein signed an agreement to prohibit the traffic in arms in Bahrein territory. P. 711/98.• o O (cj) In 1911 the Sheikh agreed not to allow any foreign Power to open a Post Oilice in Bahrein, and not to grant a pearl fishing or sponge fishing concession to foreigners. In J914 he agreed not to search for oil himself or give others permission to do so without consulting the Political Agent and receiving the approval of the Government of India. -^EL-KATR. (a) In 1868, as a result of hostilities initiated in Katr by the Sheikh of Bahrein in co-operation with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and continued by a retaliatory attack on Bahrein by Katr, Sheikh Mahomed bin Thani executed an agreement to abstain from hostilities and to accept the arbitration of the Resident, particularly in disputes as to the tribute payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein, to whom the Sheikhs of Katr were then in some degree subordinated. (b) Shortly after, the Turks established themselves in Katr; and though the British authorities did not hesitate to have direct dealings with the Sheikhs of Katr, no written agreement was made with them. (c) In the course of the negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1918 it was agreed that the southern and eastern limit of “ le Sandjuk Ottoman de Nedjd” should be a “une ligne partant du fond extreme du golfe faisant face a Pile de Zahnounie (i.e. the Bay of Salwa to the west of El Katr) qui ira directement au sud jusqu’au Ruba’-al-Khafi et separera le Nedjd de la presqu'-ile de FEl-Katr.” Further, it was agreed that “ le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique—ne permettra pas au cheikh de Bahrein de s’immiscer dans les affaires interieures d’el-Katr, de porter atteinte a Tautonomie de ce pays ou de I’annexer.” (d) The separation of El Katr from Nejd and its independence of Bahrein having been thus established (though not thereby given effect), the way was open for the conclusion of a Treaty signed on 3rd November 1916 after the Turks had finally been expelled from El-Katr in the course of the war. In this treaty the Sheikh takes note of, undertakes the obligations Articles I and n resulting from, and is promised the advantages accruing from the various •engagements concluded by the Trucial Chiefs for the suppression of slave trade and piracy and the preservation of the maritime peace. In Article III he undertakes to prohibit arms trade in Katr and to •observe the arms traffic rules of the British Government. In Articles IV and V he undertakes to have no relations with the Agent of any other Power without the consent of the British Government, or to cede land by lease, sale or gift or to grant monopolies, concessions or cable landing rights. • In Articles VII, VIII and IX he undertakes to protect British residents and, if required, receive a British representative, and establish a British post and telegraph office. In return the British Government undertakes in Articles X and XI to protect the Sheikh, his subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to grant their good offices should he or his subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar ; it being understood that this obligation only applies in the event of such aggression by land or by sea being unprovoked by the Sheikh or Ids subjects. Note. —From para. 10 of the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on p. 88 it will be seen that on the question being raised by the Sheikh in 1921 of the assistance which he might expect from Government in the event ■of an attack by Ibn Sand, he was informed that His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance. TRUCIAL COAST (Ras-ul-Khaima, Abu Dhabi, Dabai, Shargah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain). (a) In 1820 these chiefs signed the general treaty (see Bahrein (a)) prescribing perpetual abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea, and from irregular (i.e. unproclaimed) war; registration of dhows; peace with the British Government; abstention from the carrying off or transport of slaves; free entry of their ships into British ports; “and if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it.” * * “ Them ” in the context appears to mean the ships of the signatory Chiefs; but it may mean the Chiefs.■ m 4 (6) In 1838, 1839 and 1847 agreements were entered into by these Chiefs for the suppression of slave trade, and for the searcli and, if necessary, seizure by British warships of any of their vessels suspected of engaging in this trade. (c) In 1843 a Maritime Truce for ten years was signed by these Chiefs “being full}’ impressed with a sense of the evil consequences arising from our subjects and dependents being prevented from carrying on the pearH^ fishery without interruption on the banks, owing to the various feuds existing among ourselves ” This Truce cancelled the right of the Chiefs, implied in the general Treaty of 18^0, to wage regular war on each other. Under the Truce they agreed to refer disputes and cases of aggression to the decision of the Political Resident. In 1853 the Truce was renewed in perpetuity. (d) In 1892 exclusive agreements were signed by all the Trucial Chiefs, on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, that they will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; that without the consent of the British Government they will not consent to the residence in their territories of the agent of any other Government; and that they will on no account cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, any part of their territories, save to the British Government. (e) In 1902 the Chiefs undertook to prohibit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from their territories. (/) In 1911 the Sheikhs undertook not to give pearling or sponge fishing concessions, save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government. (g) In 1922 similar undertakings were given regarding oil. Aitchison, Vol. XII, p. 207. Do., pp. 220, 221. Do., p. 226. Do., p. 227. Do., p. 229. Do., p. 230. Do., p. 232. OMAN (MUSCAT). (i) Treaties and Agreements with Great Britain. (a) Treaty relations date from 1798, when an agreement was made by the- Imam with the East India Company to exclude the French and Dutch from his territories “whilst warfare shall continue between the English Company and them.” (b) In 1822 a Treaty for Suppression of the Slave Trade was signed, providing inter alia for action by the Imam’s officers in Muscat territory, and for seizure, outside certain limits, by the British of any vessels carrying slaves to Christian countries. (c) In 1839 a Commercial Treaty was concluded on a reciprocal most favoured-nation basis, providing for the purchase, sale or hire of lands by British subjects in Muscat territory, appointment of Consuls, protection of Muscat subjects in British employ, extraterritoriality for British subjects, unrestricted trade, limitation of import duties to 5 per cent, and freedom from export duties. (d) In 1839 and 1845 further enactments reinforced the right of British vessels to detain and search and if necessary confiscate Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves, outside certain limits. (e) In 1862 an Anglo-French Declaration was signed under which the French Government and Her Majesty’s Government engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. (/) In 1864 the Sultan agreed to permit the construction of, and to protect, one or more telegraph lines in his own territories or in those leased by him from Persia. But no sovereign right was to be conferred on the British Government over any such territory. This was followed in 1865 by a similar convention in respect of His Highness’ territories in Arabia and Mekran. (g) In 1873 a further Treaty for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was concluded. This extended the powers of seizure possessed by British vessels to include seizure of Muscat vessels trading between Muscat ports: the Sultan undertook to shut all slave markets in his dominions and to protect liberated slaves. (h) In 1891 a new Treaty of Commerce, Friendship and Navigation was concluded, which cancelled the Treaty of 1839, but was framed on similar lines. Coals, provisions, Ac., for Her Majesty’s ships were to be exempt from duty (Art. 6). No export duties were to be levied without the consent of Her Majesty’s Government. This treaty, like that of 1839, provided a capitulatory regime for British subjects.(tj Im 1891 au agreemeut was also signed by the Sultan, pledging him Aitchison, Yoi. xn, never to ©ede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give in occupation any of his 240- dominions or dependencies, save to the British Government. (j) In 1895 a guarantee was given to the Sultan that, whatever the differences between the Sheikhs of Oman and the Sultan, Government would not allow the former to attack the two towns of Muscat and Mattrah. The Sultan issued a notilication in these terms. The warning was renewed in 1913. P. 2749/13. (k) In 1898 a proclamation was issued giving British and Persian vessels Aitchison, Voi. xii, the right to search British, Persian or Muscat vessels in Muscat waters, and p ' 241 ' Muscat vessels in British or Persian waters, for arms and ammunition. (l) In 1902 the Sultan undertook to grant His Majesty’s Government the Do., p.242. first option on mining rights in the Sur coalfields. (m) In 1903 the Sultan issued a notification authorising the searching by Memo. a.p. 172 British and Italian ships, both on the high seas and in Muscat waters, of Muscat vessels suspected of carrying arms to certain prohibited African areas. (?i) In 1923 the Sultan undertook not to give any oil concession without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. (ii) Treaties with other Powers. (а) In 1833 the Sultan concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Do., p. cljc. the United States of America providing for perpetual peace, unrestricted trading (except that muskets and ammunition might not be sold to private persons in Zanzibar), limitation of import duties to 5 per cent., reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to trading charges, and appointment of consuls. (б) In 1814 a Treaty of Commerce was concluded with France in terms ulmost identical with the British Treaty of 1839. (c) In 1877 a short Treaty with Holland provided reciprocal most-favoured- do., p. clxxx. nation treatment for the nationals of each country, both generally and in respect oif import duty and the regulations regarding export and transit.

Article G of the Treaty of Jeddah (1927) runs as follows:— “His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Koweit and Bahrein, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with If is Britannic Majesty’s Government.” The Foreign Office have accordingly communicated to Ibn Saud copies of the treaties given to Turkey in 1911, together with the El Katr treaty of 191G, and a complete set of the Muscat treaties with His Majesty’s Government as published in Aitchison. lie has also been informed of the “ o-ood offices” accorded to Koweit, and of the provisions of Article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement. 3. To the Persian Government. In September 1928 His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Teheran, was instructed to communicate to the Persian Government the text of the exclusive agreements of 1892 with the Trucial Chiefs. This was done in a Note dated 7th September 1928. Teh. Desp. 391, Sept. 7 1928. India Office, 29th September 1928.CONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE B. 402. P 4804/28. EL KATR, 1908 16. 1. The FT Katr (or Qatar) Peninsula, which is governed by the Sheikhs of the Thani family, lies south of Ojair, in the district of Qatif, the most southernly point to [which, with the exception of Koweit, His Majesty’s Government prior to the War of 1914 recognised continuous Turkish influence. It lies, on the other hand, north of El Odeid, to which the Trueial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was allowed to assert his rights of possession in 1878, and which prior to 19.lt) formed the western boundary of the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs. The status of the Peninsula formed the subject of lengthy discussion in the period prior to 1908, details of which will be found in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908. 2 . The vexed question of the status of El Katr was finally disposed of in the Anglo-Turkish negotiations of 1912-14. Under the unratitied Anglo- Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, the Ottoman Government renounced all rights to the Peninsula, which was, as in the past, to continue to be governed by the Sheikhs of the Thani family, while His Majesty’s Government engaged not to permit the Sheikh of Bahrein to interfere in the internal affairs of El Katr, to threaten its autonomy or to annex it. A supplementary article reserved the rights of the inhabitants of Bahrein to visit the island of Zakhnuniyah for fishing purposes, as in the past. 3. A new situation arose with the conquest of Hasa by Ibn Sand in the course of 1913. El Katr, like the Oman coast, formed, in his view, part of his ancestral domains, to which he could therefore prefer a claim as of right.* But the Amir was warned at the end of the year that non-interference with El Katr was a condition of the maintenance of friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government,| and no difficulty in consequence arose. The conclusion of a formal treaty between El Katr and His Majesty’s Government, which, other considerations apart, was in the immediately pre-war period of much importance in connection with the arms traffic, was postponed^ until the final ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention, and so had not been disposed of on the outbreak of the European War. 4. In common with the rulers of the other States in the Gulf, the Sheikh of El Katr was notified by the Political Resident of the outbreak of war with Turkey in November 1914,§ and throughout the period of the war maintained a friendly attitude towards His Majesty’s Government. 5. Under the treaty concluded between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud on the 26th December 1915, the Ruler of 'Nejd undertook to refrain from aggression on, or interference with, “the territories of . . . the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast, who are under the protection of the British Government, and who have treaty relations with the said Government, and the limits of their territories shall be hereafter determined.” 6 . The outbreak of the European War, which led to a falling off in the arms traffic in the Gulf, rendered the conclusion of a definitive treaty with El Katr less urgent, and it was not until May 1915J that the question was revived. Lengthy negotiation proved necessary before a satisfactory agreement could be reached, and it was not until 3rd November 1916^[ that a treaty was finally concluded between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. The treaty, the terms of which are summarised in the precis of treaties appended to the present Memorandum, secured to the Sheikh the advantages conferred under the Trucial treaties on the Sheikhs of Trucial Oman, while imposing on him the obligations in regard to piracy, the slave traffic, the arms traffic, the grant of concessions, the cession, sale, gift, lease 3091b 50 10.28 * P.A.

In order to secure the signature of the Sheikh, it was agreed that the articles of the treaty (7, 8 and 9) which related to the admission of British subjects to Katr for trading purposes and their protection while so engaged, the admission of an Agent on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, and the establishment of post and telegraph offices in Katr, should remain inoperative for the present, while a minor concession was made in respect of the retention by the Sheikh and his dependents of negro slaves actually in their possession, on the understanding that they would receive “fair and just treatment.” 7. The one respect of importance in which the treaty went beyond the normal type of Trucial treaty was that it contained an undertaking that the good offices of His Majesty’s Government should be granted to the Sheikh in the event of unprovoked aggression against him by land within the territories of Katr (Article XI). The assurance in question did not, however, in practice impose any very serious liability on His Majesty’s Government, as was shown when a tentative appeal was made to it by the Sheikh in 1922 }$ (see para v 9 of Memorandum on the Trucial Sheikhs, 1908-28, on page ^). * G. of I.

It is not proposed in this memorandum to enter in any detail into the internal history of the Trucial States, but rather to deal in a general way with the developments which have taken place in the last 20 years, and tne problems presented by the States as matters stand to-day. 2. The Trucial Chiefs—so-called on account of the treaties of maritime truce concluded by them betw r een 1820 and 1853 with His Majesty’s Government, under which a check was imposed on their internecine strife and their piratical and slaving activities in the Gulf—are the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaima, Umm-al-Qaiwain, Ajman, Shargah, Dabai, Abu Dhabi and El Katr. The last-named Principality, the history of which between 1908 and 1916 is separately dealt with in the Note on p. JJJ, was added to the number of the Trucial States consequent on the conclusion* on 3rd November 1916 of a treaty between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government, under which His Majesty’s Government recognised ihe independence of El Katr and, in return for certain undertakings, extended to it the benefit of the guarantees contained in the Trucial Treaties. The territory ruled over by the Trucial Sheikhs at the present day lies on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, between the west side of the Promontory of El Katr (or Qatar) and approximately the north point of the Musandim Promontory in Oman (compare Map II appended to this Memorandum). 3. The Trucial States remain independently administered tribal princi palities, governed by independent Arab Sheikhs. The Trucial Treaties (the substance of which is given in the precis of treaty engagements printed as an Appendix to this Memorandum) accord to the contracting parties the right to accredit a representative on the one side at the headquarters of the several Chiefs, and on the other at the British Residency at Bush ire ; but in practice the Chiefs have no representatives, and His Majesty’s Government are represented only by a native agent of the Residency at Bushire, who is stationed at Shargah, on the Trucial Coast, and moves from place to place as required. 4. Responsibility for the political control of the States rested up to the end of the war with the Government of India. The Masterton-Smith Committee made no specific reference to them, but, on the general principle underlying the recommendations of that Committee, the affairs of the States would appear to continue to be primarily the concern of the Government of India, subject to the ultimate control of His Majesty’s Government, save when they involve or touch on major questions of policy involving relations with Ibn Sand, or affecting the Arabian policy of His Majesty’s Government. In that case they fall to be dealt with directly by His Majesty’s Government through the Colonial Ollice. 5. Save in respect of the Residency Agent at Shargah, there appears to be no political expenditure in connection with the Sheikhs. No subsidies are or have been paid to any of their number, although the grant of a subsidy to the Sheikh of El Katr was considered and ultimately rejected in connection with the negotiation of the treaty concluded with him on the 3rd November 1916.| II.—Internal History, 1908-28. 6. The internal history of the Trucial States in the last 20 years is of no general interest or importance, and it is unnecessary to recapitulate it here. The incident of most importance in the pre-war period was an undertaking by the Sheikhs not to give pearling or sponge fishing concessions,!); save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government. During the war the Sheikhs adopted a friendly attitude ; and, broadly speaking, they have satisfactorily implemented their engagements to llis Majesty’s Government in matters such as the arms traffic and the slave trade. His Majesty’s Government have consistently avoided entanglement in their internal affairs, 309U 75 10.28 A * P. 268/17- t Tel. from S. of S. for I. to Viceroy, Sept. 9 1915, P. 3296/15. t P. 2062/11, P. 1203/12.9 Letters from Pol.

Oil. 7. In view of the importance of the oil question it should be placed on 4% record that the Tru.cial Sheikhs of Shargah, Ras-al-Khaima, Oabai, Abu' Dhabi, Ajman and bmm-al-Qaiwain agreed in 11)2:2 not to grant a concession in the event of oil being found in their territories, save with the permission of His Majesty's Government. No question of a concession has so far arisen. (Considerable discussion has, however, taken place between the Sheikh of El Katr (who is precluded by Article 5 of his Treaty of 3rd December 1916 from granting any concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government), and various oil interests affected in regard to the grant of a concession in his territory ; and an option for 18 months in which to negotiate for an oil concession was granted by him to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in March 1926. The negotiations have throughout been conducted under the close supervision and with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. III.—External Developments affecting the Trucial Sheikhs, 1908-28. 8. The developments in relation to the Sheikhs of most importance during the period now in question have been external. They are— (a) The rise of Ibn Sand. (b) The recent reassertion of Persian authority in the Persian Gulf. Ibn Sand and the Trucial Sheikhs. 9. As will be seen from the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, the Wahabi connection with the Trucial Coast is of long standing, although for many years prior to 1913 it had ceased to be of any political importance. Hut the conquest of Hasa by Ibn Sand in 1913 again brought the Wahabi movement directly in touch with the Trucial Sheikhs.* To' their territory, as to El Katr, Ibn Sand maintained a hereditary claim. He was, however, warned by the Political Resident of the special treaty relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Sheikhs,! and he maintained an entirely correct attitude towards them during the following years. By the Treaty of 26th December 1915, Ibn Sand undertook to abstain from aggression on or interference with the Trucial Sheikhdoms, or with El Katr,! and that instrument formally governed his relations with the States until the conclusion of the Treaty of Jeddah in the spring of 1927. 10. No incident of importance appears to have arisen as between Ibn Sand and the Trucial States until after the European War. In 1921§ the Sheikh of El Katr represented that he was alarmed at the prospect of some of his townspeople becoming Akhvvan and joining Ibn Sand, and asked whether Government would help him should he be attacked from the interior. He was informed in reply that Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance should he be attacked by Ibn Sand. At the end of 1922 the Sheikh again represented ] that, while he did not tear an open attack by Ibn Sand so long as the latter remained on good terms with His Majesty’s Government, he was seriously alarmed by the more subtle methods employed, he alleged, by the Nejd authorities to make his position impossible. The Political Resident commented that he did not see any practicable means to prevent peaceful penetration of the country by the Akhwan and Ibn Sand’s adherents. He suggested that a hint mbdit be given to Ibn Sand to keep his people in order. No action was taken^on this proposal, Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in Iraq, reporting^ that, on finding that Ibn Sand was apparently including the Katr Peninsula within the tract of country for which he was prepared to negotiate an oil concession, he had already very recently “ taken him to task, reminding him that he had nothing to do with Katr, except to respect it, under the terms of his treaty Avith us, and insisting on the limitation of his discussions to the country west of the longitude of Salwah Bay. His Highness accepted this injunction without argument.” The Sheikh has maintained his independenceo O though it transpired in the air reconnaissance of the Gulf in 1027 that he attaches great importance to avoiding action which might be unpalatable to the Wahabi King. 11. The activity of the Wahabis again came prominently to notice in 1926. The Political Resident then reported 00 that of the Trucial Chiefs, ^the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dabai, together with a number of the tribes ^under their suzerainty or adjoining their territory, were whole-heartedly opposed to Ibn Sand ; that the Sheikhs of Shargah and Ras-al-Khairna were definitely supporters of the \\ ahabi. King ; and that the Sheikhs of Ajman and Dm in al Qaiwain were inclined to be neutral. In a number of instances the Wahabi Governor of Hasa, Ibn Jiluwi, appeared to have acted in an extremely high-handed manner in the ITucial Sheikhdoms, and the Political Resident was inclined to the view that he aimed at the absorption in Nejd of all Trucial Oman and “Independent” Oman (Jau), and at the establish ment of contact with a large district of the Oman Sultanate which was opposed to the Imam and almost independent of the Sultan. 12. An element of doubt existed as to the extent to which Ibn Sand was personally responsible for, or even cognisant of, the activities of the Governor of Hasa; it was decided, after considerable discussion, that no action should lie taken in the matter pending the conclusion of the new treaty then in negotiation with him ;tt ant ^ assurances secured in that treaty from the King were ultimately held to dispose of the matter. 13. The Government of India were strongly in favour of the inclusion in the treaty in question of an undertaking as regards the 1 racial duels substantially identical with that embodied in the Treaty of 26th December 1915 (see para. 9 above). It proved impossible to secure Ibn Sand’s agreement to this His Majesty’s Government regarded the point as one which it was undesirable to press too far, and in the result the King of the Hejaz and Nejd, in the treaty signed at Jeddah on 20th May 1927, undertook merely “to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with . . . the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government.” 14. The result of the reconnaissance undertaken in connection with the air route in the Persian Gulf along the north Arabian shore in the spring of 1927 was to show that the influence of Ibn Sand had increased in a very marked manner along the north Arabian littoral, and considerable difficulties were placed in the way of the reconnaissance on the ground, either expressed or implied, that political difficulties would be causeu v\ith the Y\ ahabis and the Wahabi King by the landing of aeroplanes, Ac. (cp. Note on Air Communications in the Gull on p. !»1»)- ^o impressed was the lolitical Resident by the rise of the Wahabi power and by the insecurity to which a chain of air stations along the Arab coast might be exposed by internal dissensions and the danger of Wahabi interference in the petty Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, that in the spring of 1927 he suggested 0 that the long-established policy of abstention by His Majesty’s Government from all but naval commitments should now be discarded and replaced by a definite assumption of responsibility in the States concerned for the oideilx succession of Sheikh to Sheikh, for his maintenance in power, and for the protection of his territories by land as well as by sea. 15. The Government of India gave careful and sympathetic consideration to the Resident’s proposals. But the conclusion at which they finally arrived'!' was that, even though the guarantees of non-interference given by Ibn Sand in the Treaty of Jeddah of 1927 fell considerably short of those which he had been prepared to accept in 1915, they conveyed to the King of the Hejaz a clear intimation, solemnly accepted by him, of the special position and of the interest in the Trucial Sheikhdoms of His Majesty’s Government. Past history, in the view of the Government of India, justified them in relying for security against the danger of \\ ahabi encroachments on the treaty°engagements into which Ibn Sand had entered with His Majesty’s Government, and, while it was impossible to forecast the effect on Gulf politics of the death of Ibn Sand, they were not prepared, in these circum stances, to make an immediate reversal of their policy in the Persian Gulf Letter from Pol.

Should a more definite assertion be called for by subsequent developments, that assertion k ‘ could be made and enforced on the basis of our existing political position and sea power.” As to the air route, they regarded its establishment along the Arab littoral, should a decision to this end be reached, as both possible and advisable without any alteration in “our old and well-tried Gulf policy.” 'They added that the mere presence of an aerodrome would, to some extent^ afford a visible guarantee of British protection, but indicated that some subsidy to the Sheikhs in whose territories the aerodromes would lie or over whose territories the air route would pass would probably be necessary. The reassertion of Persian Authority in the Persian Gulf. 16. It is only in the last two years that Persia has commenced to adopt an active policy in the Gulf. The result of the adoption of that policy has been to bring her into conflict on certain points with the Trucial Chiefs and their interests. The Trucial settlements on the south Persian coast, the occupation of Henjam for so many years by Trucial Arabs, the Trucial ownership of the islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri, the title to which of the Sheikhs of Shargah and Uas-al-Khaima is contested by Persia, have all afforded grounds of friction. 17. The three most important incidents which have arisen are the expulsion by Persia of the Sheikh of Henjam in May 1928, the arrest in duly 1928 of a Trucial dhow plying between Dabai and Khassab, which raised the question of the status of Tamb, and—a direct consequence of the last-named incident—the questioning by Persia of the independence of the Trucial owners of Tamb. * Pol. Kes. to G. of I., July 20 1928, P. 4718. t Tel. from Pol. Res. to G. of I., June 12 1928, P. 3077. 18. The history of the expulsion of the Sheikh of Henjam is given in paras. 28 to 84 of the Memorandum on llenjam on page f||. The incident was one the disposal of which would, in all probability, have presented relatively little difficulty, had it been possible to localise ii. But the Sheikh of Henjam is the father-in-law of the Trucial Sheikh of Dabai; and he and his people are by race Jowasimi Arabs, who claim never to have accepted Persian nationality, and who maintain very close relations with their fellow tribesmen on the north Arabian shore.* As a result, disturbances in Hen jam react immediately on feeling on the Trucial Coast, and in the present instance the effect of the expulsion of the Sheikh was, according to the Senior Naval Officer, so greatly to excite the Trucial Arabs that they had stated that were it not for “ the British action and our gunboats, they would come in thousands, seize Kishm Island and Henjam, and kill every Persian on the islands.”! Representations in the strongest terms were made to the Residency Agent and the Political Resident, and Sir Lionel Haworth reported that he had been informed by the brother of the Sheikh of Dabai, whom he describes as one of the most level-headed and sensible chiefs on the Trucial Coast, that “if we did nothing to help them, they were prepared to tear up our treaties, much as they liked them, have done with our air route and kill all Persian officials they could and massacre all Persians on the Arab coast.” + 1.0. to F.O., June 23 1928, P. 317fi.

As will be seen from the Memorandum on Henjam, it was agreed, in the early stages of this incident, that the intervention of His Majesty’s Government at Tehran on behalf of the Sheikh would do more harm than good.! The strength of feeling aroused on the Arab littoral, and the danger emphasised by the Political Resident—that the Trucial Arabs might have recourse to Ibn Sand should His Majesty’s Government, while failing themselves to intervene effectively on behalf of the Sheikh, refuse to allow the Sheikh of Dabai to approach the Persian Government regard in a-him have since, however, led the Government of India to modify their^view! Attention has also been drawn by the Colonial Office to the difficulties which would arise were the Trucial Arabs to become supporters of Ibn Sand and while for the moment the return of the Sheikh to Henjam at the invitation of the Persian Government gives hope that a satisfactory solution of the incident may be found, reconsideration of the decision of IBs Majesty’s Government not to intervene with Persia may be called for should thisunfortunately prove not to be the case {cp. para. 39 of Memorandum on Henjam on page Q). The incident, and its reactions on the Trucial Coast, on which, as the Government of India remarked, “anti-Persian feeling is always a matter of concern to us, and any anti-Persian ebullition might lead to serious embarrassment,”* illustrate, in any event, the difficulty of the situation to which action, however justified, by Persia may give rise, where ^the Trucial Arabs are concerned. 20. The Tamb incident is dealt with in paras. 33 and 34 of the Memorandum on the Status of Tamb, &amp;c., on p. ™. It will be seen that it was with great difficulty that the Sheikhs affected by the Persian arrest of the dhow in question were restrained from undertaking reprisals against Persia; that the Persian claim to the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa, which have been recognised by His Majesty’s Government as Trucial territories, remains to be disposed of, and that the question of compensation to the Sheikhs and to the owner of the dhow and his passengers is still unsettled. Persia and the independence of the Trucial Chiefs. 21. The newspaper Habl-ul-Matin, which is understood to derive inspiration from the highest quarters, so long ago as November 1927 included in a list of Persian desiderata the “ renewal of the Protectorate of Persia over Muscat and other small Sheikhs of the coast of Oman.” The first official indication of a Persian claim of this nature arose, however, in connection with the Tamb incident in August 1928, when the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs formally stated in a Note that “ the Persian Government cannot recognise as independent and owner of the said islands ” the Sheikh on whose behalf representations have been made by His Majesty’s Government, and added that in consequence “ my Government cannot in any way approve the attitude that the British Government have adopted on the pretext of having treaties with the above-mentioned Sheikh, and cannot accept resulting declaration which you make of protecting him.” 22. The Note left room for doubt as to whether the Persian challenge of the independence of the Sheikh in question was directed to his status as regards Tamb and Abu Musa, to which a claim is preferred by Persia, or to his status as a Trucial Chief on the Arab Coast. The Charge d’Affaires at Teheran was, however, instructed in reply to communicate officially the text of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892 with all the Trucial Chiefs, and to state that His Majesty’s Government entirely failed to understand the Persian statement, and could not admit direct dealings between the Chiefs and the Persian Government. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added, “ You will realise that vis-d-vis of Foreign Powers, there is no distinction for a purpose like the present between the Sheikh of Ras-al- Khaima and the other Trucial Chiefs, and effect of Persian Note is to challenge our right to protect any of them from external aggression . . . the status of His Majesty’s Government on the Arabian coast is not open to discussion, nor can they recognise any Persian claim on that side of the Gulf.” 23. A Persian reply, holding to the views expressed in their earlier Note and adding that “all agreements made with Trucial Chiefs which harm or limit the rights and interests of Persia cannot be recognised as valid or legally be cited as reason for measures against Persian Government ” has since been received. The Political Resident reports, moreover, that the Governor of Bushire is alleged to have received instructions from Teheran that Persia recognises no Arab rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that all persons belonging to and arriving from Katr and the Trucial Coast (as from Muscat, Koweit and Bahrein) are to be considered Persian subjects and Persian passports issued to them. It seems clear in the circumstances that the possibility of a formal claim by Persia to suzerainty on the Trucial Coast, whether based on her temporary control of portions of that coast in the early eighteenth centuryt or on intrigues such as that unsuccessfully undertaken by the Sartip on her behalf in 1887,J and subsequently repudiated by the Persian Government, cannot be ignored. The seriousness of the issues to which such a claim would give rise, if pressed, needs no emphasis. * Tel. from Viceroy, 1206 S., June 18 1928, P. 3157. Tel. from Pol.

X Lor. i, 737.6 IV.—Summary. . ^ ie ex tension to the coast of the authority of Ibn Sand and the- influence of the Wahabi movement, the rcassertion of Persian authority in the Persian (udf, and the question of an Imperial air route along the north Arabian coast, have combined to invest the Trucial Sheikhdoms with a new importance. If the air route is to materialise ; if 11 is Majesty ’s Governments^ in the light of the report of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee, remain of the™ opinion that the maintenance of British influence in the Gulf is a matter of paramount importance, alike from the Imperial and from the Indian standpoint; and if they are no longer.to enjoy on the south Persian coast the privileged position which they have enjoyed in the past; then the consoli dation of their influence on the north Arabian shore is a matter of very much greater and more definite importance than at am r earlier period. 25. If, however, that influence is to be maintained and consolidated, the lact that the Trucial Chiefs are guaranteed (even though to an extent difficult precisely to define) the protection of His Majesty’s Government, and are forbidden to communicate with outside Powers or to receive their representatives, necessitates a clear understanding as to the extent to which His Majesty s Government are in a position and are prepared to defend their interests, whether against Persia or against Ibn Sand. 26. Ot the two, Persia presents the less serious problem. Even should she seriously put forward claims to suzerainty on the Arab coast, she is not,, as matteis stand, in a position to enforce them, nor could His Majesty’s Government acquiesce in her pursuit of an active policy of aggression on the north Arabian coast, any more than in those Trucial islands in the Gulf which they have recognised as vested in the Trucial Chiefs, without resiling from the policy which they have hitherto consistently pursued. Moreover, the 1 racial Sheikhs and their tribesmen are bound to Persia by ties neither of race nor of religion, while the north Arabian shore (as distinct from the 1 racial islands, certain of which appear to contain valuable mineral deposits) offers no commercial or pecuniary reward to justify an active Persian interest. * Letter from P.A., Bahrein, to Pol. Rea., April 1* 1927 P.3334/27. 2&lt; . Ibn Saud, and the Wahabi movement of which he is the representative,, constitute a much more serious problem. In the first place, in the words of Sheikh Hamad of Bahrein, Ibn Saud is “the one big Arab ruler, and it is natural for all the smaller Arab Sheikhs ... to look up to him and try to please him. Historically, he has claims ol standing to a predominant influence on the Trucial Coast, and geographically his extension to that coast would, but for the presence of His Majesty’s Government, be a natural process. The special tenets of the Wahabi creed are familiar to the Trucial tiibesmen ; certain at any rate of the r J racial Sheikhdoms are traditionally strongly Wahabi in outlook; while racially the Trucial Arabs and the W ahabis of the interior descend from common stocks. 28. It is clear that in these circumstances the problem of preventing the absorption of the Trucial Sheikhdoms by Ibn Saud or their gradual penetration by Wahabi influence is one of great difficulty, the more so in view of the known Wahabi sentiments of certain of the Trucial Sheikhs. VT possible military aggression by the King of the llejaz and of Nejd may be discounted so long as his general relations with His Majesty’s Government remain friendly, and the Government of India have already expressed the view (see para. 15 above) that they are justified, in the light of past history, in relying for security against the danger of Wahabi encroachments on the treaty engagements into which Ibn Saud has entered with llis Majesty s Government. But w 7 hde this is true of an aggressive military policy, it appears almost impossible for His Majesty’s Government effectively to prevent the penetration by peaceful means of the Trucial States by Ibn Saud and his adherents-a process the more difficult to combat for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph. —.1. As matters stand, the most that it appears possible for Ills Majesty’s- Government usefully to do is to arrange for the showing of the flag by His Majesty’s ships along the Trucial Coast, possibly to a greater extent even than at present; to construe in a strict sense the undertakings given by 4 [ 4 •! ft H 4 V rIbn Sand in the Treaty of Jeddah of 1927 ; and to keep a close watch for action, whether prompted by Ibn Sand himself or the independent work of over-zealons lieutenants, which can be regarded as calling for remonstrance, in view of the terms of the treaty. The value of the constant reminder of British power which is given by a naval patrol cannot be exaggerated ; the importance of the support of His Majesty's ships to a ruler threatened by a fanatical hinterland has been illustrated in recent years, though in different circumstances, in Muscat. The establishment of an air route, should His Majesty’s Government decide upon that course, will go some way towards the assertion on the north Arabian coast of the influence of His Majesty’s Government. The payment of subsidies to the Chiefs, should that prove ultimately unavoidable, in connection with the establishment of air stations, may further be of value in consolidating British influence; the elimination of British influence from the south Persian shore, and the possibility that Persia may question the retention of the Residency at Bushire, may lead to a reconsideration of political arrangements in the Gulf, one effect of which would be to fix the headquarters of the Resident on or near the Arabian littoral of the Gulf; but while for the moment the objections urged by the Government of India to the adoption of the policy of active intervention in the affairs of the Trucial Coast suggested by the Political Resident (pnra. 1J above) appear conclusive, the possibility that at some later stage consideration •of that policy may be necessitated by developments which cannot at present be foreseen, is one which must be faced. 30. To sum up. His Majesty’s Government by their treaty engagements control the foreign relations of the Trucial Chiefs, to whom, in addition, they have promised either directly or by implication a degree of protection which it is difficult precisely to define. Their written engagements to the Chiefs have been supplemented by utterances such as that made by Lord Curzon, when Viceroy of India, on his visit to the Gulf in 1903, an appeal to the terms of which has so recently as the summer of the present year' :i: ‘ been made by certain of the Chiefs affected. The original reason for contracting the engagements in question was the suppression of piracy, the slave traffic and the arms traffic, and the preservation of the maritime peace of the Gulf. In the changed circumstances of the present day, those arguments for the maintenance of a predominant British influence are supplemented by the wider political considerations referred to in para. 21 above. But the change in the general situation which has made the maintenance of British influence on the Trucial Coast of greater general importance from the Indian and the Imperial point of view is accompanied by the probable necessity of facing wider liabilities, or of interpreting in a more generous or a more binding manner the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the defence of the interests of the Sheikhs protected. V.—Points referred to in connection with Deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 31. The following points have been specifically referred to in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee :— (a) On the Arabian coast Koweit and the so-called Trucial Chiefs are continually threatened by Ibn Saud. Is the maintenance of their independence necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured? (P.G. 3 VIH.) (b) Policy of His Majesty’s Government vis-d-vis Ibn Saud, with particular reference to . . . Trucial Chiefs and air route. (P.G. 6, 2 (c), 1.) (c) . Policy of His Majesty’s Government towards the Trucial Chiefs (compare Colonel Haworth’s proposal for a greater degree of interference and support, with a view to securing that they shall not be absorbed by Ibn Saud). (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 2.) (d) Steps necessary on the north Arabian coast in connection with slavery (and arms traffic). (P.G. (3, 2 (c), 3.) Lor, i, 2fi38-9. * Tel. from S.N.O. to Adltv., 1739/30, July 30 1928, P.4017.+ Tel. from Viceroy, 1782 S., Sept, 4 1928, P. 4783. X P. G. 9. VI.—Views of the Government of India. 32. The Government of India are definitely of opinion that the alienation of the Arab Protectorates would be highly impolitic from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government,! and, in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf. Sub-Committee, have expressed the viewf that the maintenance of the independence of the Sheikhdoms (absorption of whicl^T by Ibn Sand or his successor might easily lead to a speedy relapse of the Gulf into the chaos from which it has been rescued with so much difficulty) is essential. Here, as in the case of Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat, they consider that so long as Arab opinion is not alienated by an attempt at undue Westernisation, our present veiled protectorate suffices not only against European encroachment, but against the encroachments of the Wahabi State.. That protectorate can, they remark, at need be more explicitly asserted. India Office, 4th October 1928. J. G.

The first topic is an attempt by the British Government to obtain permission for an emergency landing ground in Qatar during 1932. The second topic relates to the air facilities needed by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in Qatar, if an offer of British protection is to be made to the Shaikh of Qatar in return for an oil concession for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC). In respect of this second topic, the file also contains material regarding a reconnaissance undertaken by the Royal Air Force over Qatar on the 9 May 1934 to identify suitable sites for such facilities. It includes a copy of a report on the reconnaissance – submitted by Bomber Squadron No 84, Shaibah, Iraq – on folios 27-32, along with a tracing of Qatar (folio 7) and a number of aerial photographs (folios 8-22) referenced in the report.A draft copy of the Qatar Oil Concession can be found on folios 93-101, and notes of amendments proposed by the British Government can be found on folios 80-89. In addition, a number of India Office memoranda have also been included towards the back of the file:
                           El Qatar, 1908-16(folio 167),
                           The Trucial Coast Chiefs, 1908-28(folios 168-71), and a
                           Précis of the Treaties and Engagements between the British Government and the Chiefs of the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf(folios 164-67).The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf(Trenchard Craven William Fowle), the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, officials of the Air Ministry, and officials of the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
