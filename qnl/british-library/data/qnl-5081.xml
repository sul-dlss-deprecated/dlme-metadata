Dated the 12th April,1948 / I 0(AA\*/ J Confidential. BAHRATN RECEIPT. I Date n/0± I enclose some notes on the tribes of Buraimi compiled by the Residency Agent from personal observation last summer and with the assistance of a reliable source who is a resident of Buraimi. 2. I have not been to Buraimi to check this information? on the spot because Bird, who is there now, particularly gsked me not to visit Buraimi now because he thinks that the visit of any Political Officer at this stage would be an embarrassment to him. He has found the tribes of the Dhahira, and particularly the A1 Bu Shamis, suspicious of ftteia intentions. They identify the Oil Company closely with and are convinced that Bird's real object in going there is not so much to look for oil as to spy out the land for H.M.G. who, they fear, intend to try to establish their influence over them, to interfere with their slaving activities, and perhaps to occupy their areas. Were I to appear there now and take the slightest interest in their politics, my presence might lend colour to their assumptions. For this reason I intend to keep away for /wt present; and for the same reason I have recommended that Thesiger should not go southwards beyond Hafit. ,1 intend, however, to visit Buraimi at some later date. 3. You will observe that the information now collected differs in many details from that reported by Lorimer in 1908. Many of the tribes he discusses were either inaccurately described or have since changed their habitats and increased or decreased considerably in strength. C.J.Pelly,Esquire,0.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. !: 1 | jAbu Dhabi Shaikhs. Shaikh Saqr dislikes Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid of Ajman because he hopes to accede to the Chieftainship of the Nai-a. H e also seized Masfut, a village in Wadi Hatta, from Saqr. Saqr also dislikes his maternal uncle Shaikh obaid bin Juma.h of the Beni Ka-ab because of his intrigues against hia. S aqr is reputed to be rich but is extremely parsimonious and inhospitable. He is timid and unpopular. Following the alleged plot against his life last year he has been taking strict pre- cautions for his saiety* Saqr used to receive a subsidy of Rs. S00/-/- from the Sultan of Muscat but it is reported that this has recently been discontinued because of repeated depredations by the Mai-m against Muscat. The Muscat Government claim the Mai'm as their subjects; but the latter have never recognized Muscat suzerainty and claim that they have extorted the subsidy they receive from Muscat by repeated raids on Muscat territory. Ahmad as-Salf is a cunning and intriguing old man. it is Ahmad as-Salf who attends to the affairs of the Kai'm in general and takes action to avenge them if they are attacked or robbed. Saqr is too weak to do anything to protect the interests of his people. ? / ti m •; m i 11&lt;D (^) A1 Bu Shaiais. Bedouins f Chief Muhammad bin Rahmah bin Salmin — Lives at Sinainah and Qabil.

Shaikh Zayid bin Sultan, brother of Shaikh Shakhbut, is married to the daughter of Muhammad bin Rahmah bin Salmin, but it is reported that relations between them are not good. Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad receives a subsidy of Rs. 250/-/- p.a from the Muscat Government. Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahmah also receives a subsidy and visits the Sultan of Muscat every year but neither he nor Shaikh Rashid have ever recognized Muscat suzerainty. Muhammad bin Rahmah visits Ibn Saud, Ibn Julwi, the Shaikh of Bahrain,and other Shaikhs for what he can get out of them. The Shaikh of Himiiyah, Humaid bin Abdur Kahaan, and the Shaikh of Hirah, Rahmah bin Abdur Rahman, are also of the A 1 Bushamis tribe.

Shaikh Obaid bin Juma'h, the present chief, is a respectable personality and exercises a great influence over his people. The Beni Ka*ab are known to be torn by internal dissension, but the strong personality and wise policy of Obaid have frustrated all attemps to depose him. Last year his cousins attempted to overthrow him but he dis covered their plans and took action in time. One of his cousins (No.4) is still in exile at Hamasah. Shaikh Obaid is on good terms with all other Shaikhs and tribes with the exemption of his nephew Shaikh Saqr of the Nai»m who accuses him of having assisted the Sahikh of Ajaan to seize Masfut. Shaikh Obaid receives a small subsidy from the Muscat Government - Rs. 30/-/- p.m. and occasionally visits Muscatsuzerainty over him but has never recognized Muscat or his people although Muscat consider him as their subject. Indeed, in spite of this subsidy, the Beni Ka ' ab are stl11 ver y active in their incursions on the Batinah.

He used them extensively in his hostilities against Dubai. They are related by marriage to the Abu Dhabi Shaikhs and their close relationship with Abu Dhabi dates from the time of Shaikh Zayid bin Khalifah. The Manasir received a severe blow at the hands of Dubai when many of their Shaikhs were killed in an engagement last year.i i 4) '£HE 'AW AMIR (Hinawi) Nomad and Unsettled Tribes. &amp; Chief (In Saudi Arabia) Chief (In Trucial Coast) Subsections: Salim bin Hamad bin Rakkadh of Hal Haiv Subsection* Salim bin Musallam bin Hamm (a) Hal Haiv (b) Hal Khamis (c) Hal Kalilah (d) Hilatah (e) Bait el Owaini (f) Habanin (g) Hal Itabarih (h) Hal Omar (!)
