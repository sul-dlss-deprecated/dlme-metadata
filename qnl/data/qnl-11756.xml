The strike by Customs staff, mainly over low salaries, began in 1944, reportedly with encouragement from Saiyid Shahab [Sayyid Shihāb bin Fayṣal Āl Bū Sa‘īd], Minister of External Affairs, Muscat.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd].The Arabic language material consists of two items of correspondence (English translations are included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Strikes</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Muscat Regiment</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000029#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000029#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
