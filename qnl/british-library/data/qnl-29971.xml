At the meeting on January 25th, 1937, the repre sentative of Chile informed the Council that the right of asylum had existed in Iran for centuries. The allusion was obviously to the practice of that right in remote times, and not to its present existence in Iran. In order, however, to dispel any misunderstanding, I should like to make it clear that the right of asylum has not for a long time past existed in Iran. I should be glad if you would kindly bring this explanation to the notice of the Members of the Council. I have the honour, etc. (Signed) ABDOLLAH BAHRAMY, Permanent delegate of Iran to the League of Nations.vJ &gt; q c; r; ; O *3 vJ - h (&gt; &lt; * -s BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 14th April, 1936. Circular Despatch fro,. 11 (413/2/36) SLCRTff Sir, A case arose last year in which one of His Majesty 1 s Consuls in Iran was asked hy some local merchants and ecclesiastics whether he would he prepared to allow them to take hast in the Consulate should they wish to do so. Their object was understood to he to register a protest against the existing political r^jlme. In view of this and of the length of time since any question of hast has arisen, I consider it advisable to issue the following instructions for the general guidance of His Majesty’s Consular olficers in Iran. 2 # in any such case you should follow closely the instructions in Foreign Office circular despatch of the 13th February, 1932 (W 14443 / 13880 / 50 ) , hut it is necessary to consider how far ran can he considered to he a country in which a special usage exists within the meaning of that circular. Although hast is an ancient custom formerly recognised both by the Persian Government and Jis Majesty’s Government, no recent cases have occurred and it is prob able that the present Iranian Government would hold the view that the practice of taking hast is no longer recognised. On the other hand, there can he little question hut that the custom of asylum is familiar to the Persian people and likely to he adopted by them in times of peril or civil commotion in the future as in the past, and it might prove embarrassing to His Majesty’s Legation if Hi Majesty’s Minister or one of His Majesty’s Consuls vePe i ojj^ surrender a refugee in circumstances which public opinion/ regard as a betrayal of a natural trust. Accordingly. His Majesty’s Consular Officer at(P 183 Mo, jL * ■* (413/3/56) British Legation, Tehran, j 14th April, 1936. Sir, I have the honour to tr*msmit to you herewith a copy of a circular despatch which I am addressing to all His Majesty's Consular Offices in Iran on the question of the taking of Bast in His Majesty's Consulates. 2, The wording of this Circular follows exactly that of the draft enclosed in Mr. Rendel’s letter to me ( ,6022/ 6144/34/1936) of March 17th last. 3. I am sending copies of his despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 92. I have the honour to he with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (S gaed) Ncvile Butler The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, H.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Officewill 'be prudent to proceed as far as circumstances permit on the assumption that since the reorganisation of the country by the t present Shah, the continued existence of a soecial usage has not been definitely established, it will equally be desirable to avoid making any definite admission that the right to grant bast is claimed* 3* In case, therefore, a political refugee succeeds in taking _ bast with you, you should do your utmost to avoid basing a refusal to surrender him upon the argument that such a usage still exists. You should in fact act in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 4, rather than in paragraphs 5 and 6, of the Foreign Office circular of the 13th February, 1932, subject to the proviso that you may, in any case where you think that danger to life is involved, refuse to surrender the refugee,, even to the pr 0 perly constituted authorities, until you have sought and received my instructions by telegram. It is not easy to lay down in advance any rule by which to decide whether actual danger to life exists and it would seem that such decisions can only be taken on the merits and circumstances of each individual case, giving perhaps the benefit of the doubt to the petitioner in cases where the presence of such danger appears likely without being absolutely proven* 4. Whether the usage of bast exists or not, however, it is clear that the answer to any enquiries such as those mentioned above must invariably be an emphatic negative. There must exist no ground for an accusation by the Iranian Government that one of His Majesty^ Consuls is encouraging Iranians to take bast. rn or undertaking to grant it in advance in hypothetical circumstances. To grant such requests would approach closely to aiding and /abettinghowever abetting demonstrations against the existing regime. If, in spite of all discouragement individuals manage to introduce themselves into His Majesty’s Consulate with the object of taking bast , you may afford them protection to the extent indicated in the preceding paragraph* I am, Sir, Your most obedient Servant,© Notes.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you a copy of a despatch from the acting British consul at Kermanshah containing an interesting account of local conditions and describing the growing discontent in that district with the present regime. 2. You will observe that Mr. Gault has been approached by local traders and ulema with an enquiry whether in certain circumstances he would allow them to take bast in His Majesty’s consulate. Mr. Gault asks for instructions, and I have the honour to enclose a copy of the reply which I am sending him. I should be grateful if I might be informed by telegram whether you approve the instruc tions which I have given to Mr. Gault or whether you desire any amendments. 3.

Enclosure 1. Actinq Consul Gault to Mr. Knatchbull Hugessen. (No. 23.) Sir, Kermanshah, Auaust 2, 1935. I HAVE the honour to inform you that in the course of the last week I have received tentative enquiries from some of the traders and ulema of Kermanshah as to whether I would be prepared to allow them to take bast in this consulate should they wish to do so. While I do not consider it likely at present that these are more than mere words uttered in the the hope that they will produce some declaration of policy on the part of this consulate, in view of the important principles involved in granting or refusing such a request, I should be grateful to receive your instructions as to what answer, if any, should be given. k 2. It is laid down in Foreign Office circular of the 13th February. 19 32. q'l 'Ay' that the right to grant asylum is now only based on usage and no longer exists V*' in international law and that, in general, asylum should only be given when erL^/o-Jthe refugee’s life is in danger. While the usage still presumably exists in Iran, ' ^though no case has arisen for some years, the object, as far as I can ascertain it, of the present enquirers’ seeking to take bast here would not be because of danger to their lives but for the purpose of making a protest against the regime of Government at present existing in this country. In fact, it would be similar to the occasion on which large numbers of Iranians took refuge in the British Legation in Tehran during the constitutional agitations in 1906. 3. As far as I know, no case of an Iranian taking refuge in a foreign mission or consulate has arisen since the advent of the Pahlavi regime. There might consequently be some unwillingness on the part of the authorities of the country to admit the continued existence of the right to do so, the more so as in this case, if allowed by me, it might be construed by the Iranian Government as encouraging opposition to the regime. There is also the question of the attitude which would be adopted by the police and military here. The excessive spirit of [490 cc—4]2 % # nationalism which is so much encouraged in Iran to-day, coupled with the tendency of the lesser and more ignorant officials to act first and think latei, might result conceivably in there being some difficulty in restraining these forces. 4. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the causes giving i ise to what is to-day an unusual request, I attanh hereto a memorandum giving a survey of the existing political and economic situation in Kermanshah. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES A. GAULT. Enclosure 2. Memorandum on the Political and Economic Situation in Kevmanshah, July 1935. THE most important fact is that while two years ago the Shah was merely disliked by the people here, to-day he is hated by all. 1 his fact overshadows the whole scene and is a contributory force in most of the factors making for the present feeling of uncertainty and extreme dissatisfaction in the town. 2. This restiveness has been developing for at least two months past and has been much increased by recent events in other parts of Iran. 3. The first unsettling factor to come into play was purely local, namely, the sudden drastic action taken by Tehran about six weeks ago to try and check the immense amount of smuggling which was then going on here. This began with the replacement in the middle of June of the Chief of Police, which was followed by the arrest of one of the biggest smugglers. This in turn led to the arrest of some fifty local traders on a charge of complicity. The examination of one of these led finally to the recall of the Governor and the implication of the commander of the Kermanshah garrison. It was believed that the Shah himself was taking an interest. Since the town has lived for the past few years on smuggling to a large extent and since the greater part of the population had taken a hand in the game at one time or another, everyone became very nervous and what little business was being done came to a standstill. 4. While this excitement was still at its height the decree announcing the introduction of the European hat came out, followed almost at once by the expression of the official desire that Iranian women should drop the veil. The hold of religion, though it may have been driven underground, is still strong on the people of Kermanshah, possibly because the town lies on the road from Meshed, to the holy places of Iraq, and neither of these two measures found approval except, perhaps, among the young people of the town. The dropping of the veil especially was looked upon with great disfavour by men and women alike. People began to remember Amanullah of Afghanistan. This distress of mind increased as rumours came in to the effect that telegraphic appeals had been made from Azerbaijan to a leading alim of Qum, Sheikh Abdul Kerim, for advice whether to wear the infidel hat or not. Sheikh Abdul Kerim being a Naih-i-Imam and his word on religious questions being, therefore, binding on all Moslems, declined to give an opinion one way or the other in view of the conflict between the Shah and established tradition. A few days later it was learnt here that the sheikh had been sent out of the country, presumably to Iraq. This did not at all reassure local opinion, and a new impetus was given to discontent on the news of the Meshed disturbances coming out. Kermanshah was the more interested as Sheikh Behlul, who is also believed to be a Naih-i-Imam, spent some days in Kermanshah on his way to Meshed a few weeks ago. The latest rumour is that in the course of the quelling of the disturbances the shrine itself was damaged. The extent of local ill-feeling against Reza may be judged from the fact that during the last few days a large number of the photographs of the Shah, which are obligatory in all shops, have been quietly taken down. 5. Finally, there is considerable dissatisfaction locally over the question of the price of wheat and bread. About a week ago it was announced that the purchase of wheat in Kermanshah was to be a Government monopoly and that the price was to be 120 rials a kharvar, compared with the open market price of about 80 rials a kharvar. Immediately following this came the forcible closing down of half the bakers’ shops in the town and the raising of the price of bread from 1 rial a man to 1 -20 rials a man.6. Bread being the main nourishment of the poorer classes of this country any alteration for the worse in price or quality is bound to call forth very considerable resentment against the Government or whatever body is responsible for the change. Wheat is plentiful here this year, and yet the Government has raised the price, which, in turn, has raised the price of bread. Not only that, but it is currently reported that the Government has no intention of buying all the eat available. In other words, it is merely a device to enable the Shah to sell Shahabad wheat at an enhanced price. Thus, both the landowner and the townsman are angry. The latter has an additional cause for dissatisfaction, in that the quality of the bread obtainable now, which is made with wheat bought from the Government, has already deteriorated, in spite of the rise in price. 7. While a part of the information given above is based largely on rumour, it matters little now whether the rumour be confirmed or not since public opinion has been unsettled by it and no amount of denials by the Government will make good this damage. It would seem, however, that much more powerful factors than those mentioned would need to come into play before any collective action may be apprehended on the part of the populace, at any rate here in Kermanshah. The spirit of the country has been well broken in the past few years so that much talk will be forthcoming before action is taken. Much will, of course, depend on the attitude of the army. Here the troops are said to be loyal more out of fear than by desire or conviction and this probably applies to the officers too. Further, the bulk of the Kermanshah garrison is conscripted from the town and province. Against this it is reported that within the last day or so the whole garrison has had to take an oath of fidelity to Reza Shah on the Koran. Such an oath would be binding in all eventualities, unless it had been taken with mental reservations. In any case it will undoubtedly have a deterrent effect both on townspeople and troops. The commanding officer, Sarhang Houshmand is a soldier of fortune, having already changed his coat twice—he began in the gendarmerie, then went into the South Persia Rifles and then joined Roza’s New Model Army—so if a good opportunity occurred he would probably change it again. 8. To sum up, there is undoubtedly a strong feeling of dissatisfaction wdth the present rdgime here and a definite hatred of the Shah. Both of these have been greatly increased during the last month or so by the various factors set forth above. Owing, however, to fear and lack of leadership it would not seem likely that any upheaval need be anticipated, at any rate for the present, unless a lead be given from some other part of the country. CHARLES A. GAULT, Acting Consul. Kermanshah, August 2. 1935. Enclosure 3. Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Acting Consul Gault. (No. 20.) Sir, Tehran, August 10, 1935. I HAVE received your despatch No. 23 of the 2nd August on the subject of bast. 2. As far as can be traced, the last case of an Iranian taking bast in one of His Majesty’s consulates was at Shiraz in 1924. It is, therefore, probable that the Iranian Government would, if consulted, maintain that bast was a relic of the bad old days and would absolutely dispute a claim on our part to grant asylum to political refugees. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the practice of granting asylum in such cases has in the past been exercised by His Majesty’s Legation and consulates and recognised by the Iranian Government of the day. This country must, therefore, be held to fall under the category envisaged in Foreign Office circular despatch of the 13th February, 1932, as a “ country where the usage of asylum exists.’’ 3. It follows that paragraph 5 of the Foreign Office circular should be applied in cases where political refugees manage to enter a consulate wdth the object of avoiding actual danger to life. This clearly does not mean that a party of demonstrators of the type mentioned in your despatch should be allowed to4 take bast in His Majesty's consulate with the object of staging a political protest. Still less does it suggest that individuals or parties should be allowed in advance to assure themselves of this means of safety in case of subsequent need. To agree to such a request would, as you suggest, come very near aiding and abetting disturbances against an existing regime. It is true that the famous bast in the Legation in 1909 partook of this character, but I should not wish to claim this as a precedence in discussions with the Iranian Government. In interpretii^ paragraph 5 of Foreign Office circular of the 13th February, 1932, “the scop~ of local usage'' should be held to cover only requests for asylum provided that actual danger exists to the life of the petitioner. It is not always easy to decide how far such danger really exists and it would seem that decision could only be taken on the merits and circumstances of each individual case, giving perhaps the benefit of the doubt to the petitioner in cases where the presence of danger appears likely without being absolutely proven. The readiness or not of the authorities to give the fullest guarantee for the refugee’s safety will probably be the best subsequent test. 4. Nevertheless, if you receive further tentative enquiries from citizens of Kermanshah, it is desirable to give them to understand that you will not allow them to take bast with you. In general, there must exist no grounds for any accusation on the part of the Iranian Government that we are encouraging to take bast, or undertaking to grant it in advance or in hypothetical circumstances. If, in spite of all discouragement, individuals manage to introduce themselves into His Majesty’s consulate with this object, you may assume that local usage will permit you to grant them asylum provided that actual danger to their lives can be said to exist. Any such case should at once be reported to me by telegram. 5. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Office (No. 348) with a request that they will inform me by telegraph whether they approve these instructions or whether they desire any amendment in them. Copies are also being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad. I am, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSON. Appendix.
