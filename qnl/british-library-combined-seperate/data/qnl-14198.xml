These appear to be row boats designed for smaller cargos of people or goods, possibly of the type
                           kitr(or
                           kitar),
                           hūrīor
                           shāḥūf.Due to the darkening of the photograph and underexposure of the parts of the image in shadow, however, many figures can be discerned in and around the boats from centre to immediately left of centre.Along the horizon a settlement is located on the other side of the body of water visible in the foreground and background. A large dhow can be seen moored on the horizon at right of the image.Damage, printing error or a light leak has caused a band, most discernible in the centre of the left of the image to appear under-exposed in the print. Graphite appears to have been applied to the print over this area.Inscriptions:Lower left, below image, in pen: ‘Mohammerah’Upper left, above image, in pencil: ‘b’Lower right, alongside image, in pencil: ‘32’Lower right, below image, in pen: ‘(March. 1918)’</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023517952.0x000002#share">Unknown</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
