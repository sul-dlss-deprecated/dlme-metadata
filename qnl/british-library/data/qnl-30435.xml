Council Muscat say mainland populated by Beduins entirely out of their control and acknowledging no single Sheik. They have a lawless reputation and a survey party would probably be met by opposition. If visit by the Ormonde is really important my suggestion is that the vessel should proceed there and if the inhabitants attitude is not hostile should land a survey party, but in no case go out of range of ship's guns. If the inhabitants are hostile in attitude party not to land. Addressed to the Govt of India, and^ — ^ ^Secretary of State for India 18? The above is repeated for your information.B.
