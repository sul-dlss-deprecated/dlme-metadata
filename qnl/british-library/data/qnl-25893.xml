I have dealt with the matter purely from the historical point of view. There tis undoubted ly much Intermingling of Persian and Arab blood in the islands, but one gets that in parts of Oman too, where many of the people qre^ practically bilingual (e.g. at Shar ja). ’ Yours sincerely,8th January, 1945 Dear Harrison, ^ Many thanks for your note. I am afraid that I have caused you a lo\ of trouble. Since I saw you, I. have managed to find a prelimin ary draft of my paper, on which I have based a more up-to-date and (I hope.*) more accurate memorandum. I have sent a copy of this to the F.C. '/Quid' this paper be of any interest to you? It is possi ble that they may send you a copy, but if they do not, I have one to spare. ’71th kind regards, Yours sincerelv.THK iilol^RY OF THE BAilRAIIi As the Par si an Goverm.iei.it renews its clsiia to the hohrsin Isisiid ^ fro; t time to time* it may he of so.ae interest briefly to review the * History of these islands in order to see to what extent that Govern ment can justify their case on purely historical grounds. i’he islands have been inhabited since prehistoric times, as is clear from the numerous tumuli or burial places which are to be seen on tne island of fcianama. If we a accept as correct the iden tification of filwun or bilmun with Bahrain, the earliest known fact about the islands is their capture by the Mesopotamian king iargon in or about 2372 .0. (this iargon is not to be confused with his much later Assyria** namesake, who reigned from 722 to 70p A.C.). Whether or not the J^hoenicians or some kindred race were tne people Y*ho inhabited the islands in those remote times is an unsolved pro- bie . Though there was doubtless commercial intercourse betv*een the people of Bahrain and Persia in Oumerlan and Achaetuenian times, it aoes not appear th/it Persia acquired any sovereign rijitii over tiie islands until tne reign of i.rdashir, the first iasanian monarch (22b-2hl A•D.). Sasanian control was, however, short-lived, and was not revived until the time of ghapur II (310-379 • • • kh- t enraged by raids carried out by Bahrainis on his territories, headed an expedition to Bahrain, where he wreaked a terrible vengeance. Thereafter, for over three centuries, Bahrain, as an appanage of the great province of pars, formed part of tne ^asanian empire. aoon after tne kuslim Arabs uad overtx*ruwn t*xe oasauian monarchy that is to say, about the middle of the 7th century A.D., they conquered Balirain and imposed tneir new faith on the inhabitants, jiict os they had done in ersia. or the next 300 years Bahrain was included in the dominions of, successively, the Orthodox, Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates. In the early years &gt;f the 10th century A.D. the heretical sectaries known as the oaramita or Carmathians seized Bahrain and held it for a time; it subsequently underwent many vicissitudes when a succession of Arab trib s i*eldI© - 3 - Arabs, from the Arabian malnloiid, wrested the Bahrain islands from the Persians, iixcept for an interlude of 9 years, that is, from 18ol to 1810, when the islands were held first by the tuseat Arabs and then by the Wahhabis, the A1 Khalifa family of the Utubis, has /'maintained its hold over Bahrain. Great Britain’s special connection 'with Bahrain began in 1820, when Shaikh Suleiman ibn Ahmad A1 Khalifa, as one of the signatories of the general treaty for the pacification of toe Persian Gulf, entered into treaty relations witn her. Shaikh Suleiman's grandson Mohammad concluded a further treaty with the Beat India Company in 1847 for the suppression of slavery, m moo. the conclusion of the Perpetual Tret ty of Peace and friendship be tween Great Britain and Bahrain resulted in the latter becoming^ )(. / British protectorate. To sum,~~lt will be seen that Persia has, durin_ the last seven teen centuries, had Bahrain intermittently in her pot session for some 970 years, it is to be noted, however, that over 35‘ ° f these years belong to the pre-Muhammada.; era, and that there is, apparently, no concrete evidence available to show that Persian authority was absolute throughout the period of Sasanian occupation. In more recent times, Persia cannot be said to have exercised effective rule for more than 167 years in the aggregate, and it is now over 16 yefirc since she last heici the islands* ij*{ f »</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00007b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/971</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00007b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/971</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 254/45 'Memorandum by Mr. L.
