To the SECRETARY to GOVERNMENT, Bombay. Bombay, \0th March 1859. Sir, The interest taken by the Government in the question of Cotton Cultivation induces me to address yon respecting some experiments directed by me to be tried last season at Hooblee in Dharwar, with the view of settling the question of early planting. I have not yet the results in weight of Cotton picked, as the plants are still in fall bearing, but sufficient Cotton has been picked to justify the renewal of the experiment. Thus there was picked from four acres of Egyptian Sea Island Cotton :—* Acre. On 26th November. loth December. 1st January. Total to 1 st January. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. 1st Planted Native way 12 56 74 142 3rd ,, )&gt; 14 27 40 81 223 2nd 1 foot distance 30 51 102 183 4th 2 „ „ 12 28 61 101 284 The above weights are for Seed-Cotton. The first and second acres were planted, or rather sown, about the 5th June, and the third and fourth acres from 10th to 15th June. From an acre and a quarter planted by our firm in August 1856, the total weight of Egyptian Seed-Cotton picked during the whole season was only 106 lbs., or equal per acre to only 85 lbs., or less than the quantity picked m fourteen days from the best acre of the early planted experiment. I have but little to remark upon the planting of the four acres in question, except that the seed sown at one and two feet distance respectively was put into holes from three to four inches deep, while the other two acres were sown in the usual Native way in drills. There was no water given to the plants at any time. 1 have now to draw your attention to another experiment of a more comprehensive character carried on in the neighbourhood of our Office at Hooblee. Two pieces of land, one of red soil, and the other of black soil, were prepared for sowiflg at the latter end of April, and the seed was sown, from the 11th May to 22nd June, and every four days, from 26th June to 21st August. The three descriptions of Seed—the Native, the American, and the Egyptian, were sown m separate rows in both descriptions of soil. The following reports came to hand at the following dates: —2 2lst April. —All people tell me that Egyptian and American Cotton will not pros per on red soil, but as you desire it as a trial, I must comply with your instructions. 23r&lt;? July. —The plants earliest sown were about one foot above the ground, and on every day there were some seeds that had vegetated; the largest average were those sown on the 16th May and 23rd and 27th May. 1th August. —Early sown plants were from 18 to 30 inches high ; those sown after 6th June were from three to six inches high only.

Those sown in Native way are one to one and a half feet high. There is plenty of Cotton on them. I expect shortly to receive fuller particulars of weight of Cotton picked, which I shall have the honour of forwarding to the Government; meanwhile I venture to express an opinion (although contrary to the best opinions hitherto expressed on the subject), that it is clearly demonstrated that early sown Cotton will not only vegetate but flourish in districts distant from the Sea-coast. I beg further to hand a few remarks, the result of having sown the plant under all conditions during my residence in India during the last six years. And have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, H. BROOKE. (A. C. BRICE Co.) SUGGESTIONS REGARDING THE BEST MODE OF CULTIVATING EXO TIC COTTON WITH THE VIEW OF PROMOTING ITS EXTENDED CULTURE. 1 I would suggest that patches of land of any deep soil, whether red or black, should be taken without delay in various places in the Bombay Presidency, but especially * See Native opinion above.within a convenient distance of the proposed lines of the G. I. P. and Baroda Railways. 2. I would recommend that the patches of land should be as nearly 50 acres as possible. 3. That a Native Writer, who can write English, should be appointed to take charge of each experiment, at a salary not exceeding thirty Rupees per month, and that he should have a youth as Assistant at ten Rupees per month, who would furnish reports in case of the sickness of the Native Writer. ' 4. That the several Collectors of the Districts should be invited to co-operate as much as their multifarious duties will admit, and should be requested to appoint suitable persons as Native Writers to the experiments, but that they should be exonerated from the thought and trouble incidental to looking after the experiments themselves or by their Assistants. 5. That Weekly Reports should be furnished by the Native Writers in Charge, direct to the Secretariate in Bombay, where an intelligent Native Writer should be placed in charge of the Reports. 6. With the view of having the experiments and reports properly carried out, I shall be happy (if the Government will allow me) to attend, from time to time, at the Secretariate, and furnish such instructions to the Native Writer in Charge as may seem desirable. 7. By the above plan, the desultory character of the former experiments would be avoided, and, if successful, the experiments would furnish data upon which Europeans would at once proceed to take large Cotton Farms, without the loss of time necessarily attendant upon their trying experiments for themselves. MODE OF CULTIVATION. 8. Digging the Ground. —It does not appear to me necessary that the ground should be dug all over, but merely in lines four feet apart, to a depth of about eight inches, the clods being left in large lumps until the first shower of rain, when they can be broken up and the seed sown; the digging would probably not be expensive, as a pointed mamootie will enter almost any kind of soil however hard and burnt up. Four men should be employed at the work on each 50 acres, and the length of lines dug each day should be carefully recorded. 9. Procuring the Seed. —It is absolutely essential that the seed should be new and cleaned from the Cotton as lately as possible before sowing,—as cleaned se^d, if kept in a body and only in the slightest degree damp, heats, and becomes spoiled in a few days. 10. Preparing the Seed. —The seed should be prepared for sowing in the way customary in the district, usually by wetting it and rubbing it up with dry earth, to prevent the down causing the seeds to adhere to each other. 11. Sowing the Seed. — One man should remove with a broad mamootie the earth to the depth of about three inches, at distances of two feet from each other; a woman should follow with the seed, and should drop four or five seeds on the place where the earth has been removed, and which would be about eight inches square; another man should then follow, and cover the removed earth over the seed with a mamootie. 12. Time of Sowing. —The seed should be sown, as early as possible, after the first showers of rain have enabled the clods of earth to be broken up fine. The distance of two feet might be marked on the handle of the mamootie, measuring from the blade, in order to enable the first coolie to measure the distances pretty accurately. 13. Wceding .—The sowing being completed, there would be nothing to do until the Cotton and Weeds began to come up together. It is essential that weeding should be done as carefully as possible, so as not to injure the young plants, and women should be employed to weed the plantation by hand, in w r hichever w r ay is usual in the district.Weeding will, probably, be required to be done every fourteen days or three weeks, until the plants are sufficiently large to render it unnecessary; but it will be sufficient to weed the rows only^ as the intermediate spaces not having been dug up, the growth of grass will not as yet be considerable; when it is so, it might be cut and employed to feed cattle, for which purpose it would probably realise more than the cost of cutting and. carrying. 14. Thinning. —When the plants are on the average twelve inches high, or have, say six to eight leaves, it will be necessary to pull up the weakest surplus plants, leaving only two of the best plants to each space of two feet, the pulled up plants can be immediately replanted (if there is any vacant ground) at distances of one foot from each other, but in rows of four feet apart as before. At the expiration of ten days more, the worst of the two plants remaining in each space of two feet can be pulled up and transplanted as above directed. The thinning and transplanting should be effected in wet weather, and when the soil is saturated with moisture. 15. Picking. —The first picking should take place ten days after the first ripe boll appears in the field, the second picking seven days later, and the subsequent picking twice a week, as long as there is sufficient Cotton left to make it worth the labour. Each picking should be weighed as brought in, and all the defective bolls picked out and kept separate from the perfect bolls. 16. Pruning. —When the bolls cease to open plentifully, and it becomes doubtful if the quantity picked is remunerative, all the remaining bolls should be pulled off and dried in the sun—they w^ill open in from three to six days, and the Cotton can be picked out. It will be found to be but little, if at all, inferior to that picked direct from the plants. When all the bolls are thus picked off, the plants should be topped with shears to three feet high, and the side branches sheared off to within nine inches of the stem. 17. Second Crop. —The plants will immediately begin to shoot out again, and will produce a second crop in three months from the time of pruning. The second crop can be picked as before, until it is time to break up the ground again for another crop. 18. I would not recommend any experiments to be tried w r ith the common Native Cotton, as the quality is at best too inferior to make it worth the labour of extra cultiva tion. I would, therefore, suggest that only the Egyptian Sea Island and American should be tried. 19. I shall be happy to wait upon any Member of Government who may take an interest on the subject, and reply to any objection that may be urged against the system I propose. 20. The time for preparing the ground is now rapidly approaching, and I would venture to suggest that the Government should come to as early a decision as possible on the subject, in order that the present season should not be lost. In conclusion, I may be permitted to express my conviction that Cotton, if properly cultivated, will, in India, prove to be the most profitable agricultural occupation that can be entered upon, and that in a very few years India will successfully compete with the United States. I trust that the Government will pardon me the liberty I have taken in addressing them so freely upon a subject of such general interest. And have honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient Servant, H.

The Acting Secretary to Government presents compliments, and begs to forward to Date,! loth March 1889, Mr - H - Broote ' with reference to his letter marginally quoted, regarding the Culture of copy of a Report from Dr. Forbes, the Superintendent of the Cotton Gin Factory at Dharwar, No. 20, dated the 12th ultimo, with a request to be favoured with any remarks he may have to offer on it. (Signed) B. H. ELLIS, Acting Secretary to Government. Bombay Cattle, 22nd March 1859.6 No. 20 of 1859. To J. D. INVERARITY, E sq., Revenue Commissioner, Southern Division. Sm, In reply to your letter, No. 2898 of 1858, and in continuance of my report to your address, dated 25th October 1858, I have the honour to state, that the experiment tried of early sowing with the Native variety of Cotton has also proved a failure. II. The plan has been simultaneously tried in different localities,—the early sowing took place in May and June, and in the neighbourhood of each a small quantity of the same seed was sown at the usual season, viz. August and September, with the view of being able to compare results. III. The plants from the early sown seed appear to have exhausted themselves in running to wood. They attained an average height of five feet, but their produce was not equal in quantity to one third of that of the small plants which grew beside them from the seed sown at the usual period. Besides this, they seemed unable to nourish their pods, so that the young ' forms' or bolls withered and dropped away before they had attained half their size. The Cotton also, where it had matured, was not equal in length and strength of fibre to the usual produce. IV. In addition to what has been reported in the former communication above alluded to, I have now only to add on this subject that Egyptian Cotton, whether sown early or late, does not seem adapted to these districts. It has so disappointed the Ryots- that, of their own accord, they will have nothing further to say to it, for, whilst the plant itself continues to look healthy and strong, the contents of the pod, both at the period of its ripening, and earlier, are attacked by what they call ' windblight,' but what, in reality, is an insect, which causes them to discolour and wither up, so that they cannot be picked. I have samples of the produce in this condition now by me, which can be forwarded for inspection, if required, as well as specimens of the young bolls which have withered and fallen away from the early sown Native plant, as above mentioned. Re ^ The conclusion to be drawn from the experiments of last season may be summed up as follows :— 1. Early sowing will not succeed with any description of Cotton, the produce of which ripens at a period when rain may be expected to fall, and New Orleans. this has proved 'to be the case with both New Orleans and Egyptian Cotton in the Dharwar Districts. 2. If it were not for this objection. New Orleans Cotton might be grown at the above season with advantage, in so far as that the crop might be cleaned and shipped before the monsoon. It has been observed, however, that the early produce has not been superior (either as regards quantity or quality) to that from seed sown at the usual period. Experience shows that the most advantageous season for sowing this crop is in August, and the earlier it takes place in that month the better. At the same time the soil must be in a proper condition as regards moisture, if too wet the seed will rot. Egypt - 3. Egyptian Cotton sown at all seasons has hitherto proved a failure for the reason above mentioned. 4. Early sown Native Cotton has not succeeded, owing to the plant having run to weed, Native but, possibly, pruning at the proper season might obviate this objection, and I would therefore recommend a further prosecution of the experiment. If successful, much advantage would ensue. At present the slowprocess of the Churka is the only means by which it can be cleaned ; accordingly, none of the crop leaves the country until after the monsoon, and it suffers very materially from moisture during that period. I have the honour to be, Sir, \ our most obedient Servant, G. F. FORBES, Superintendent Cotton Gin Factory. Dharwar Cotton Gin Factory, \2th February 1859. To B. H. ELLIS, Esq., Acting Secretary to Government, Bombay. Bombay, 23rd March 1859. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Memorandum, No. 1061 of 1859, and dated yesterday, enclosing a report from Dr. Forbes respecting the experiment of early planting. 2. I have read the report with much interest, as it doubtless relates to the experi ment tried by ourselves and referred to in my communication of 10th March. 3. The result thus indicated is so different from that which I had reason to expect, that I must reserve my opinion as to its merits until 1 have the particulars of weight of Cotton picked, and see the Cotton itself which has been produced. 4. I am disposed still to believe, that notwithstanding this very unfavourable report, early planting will, by steady perseverance, lead to the desired result; and 1 would respectfully submit, for the consideration of Government, whether they will be disposed to offer any encouragement to private individuals to engage in these experiments, particularly as from the mass of evidence against their ultimate success, Government may be unwilling to pursue the experiments themselves. 5. It could hardly be expected that private individuals could be induced to carrv on this experimental cultivation at considerable risk of loss, without the hope of some ultimate remuneration. 6. I would propose that the inducement should be supplied in the following form: — The Government might guarantee to a Society that I think I could establish, an annual bonus of four annas per acre upon all lands brought under cultivation with other than the ordinary Native Cotton, whether cultivated by themselves or others, for the term of twenty-one years. Such bonus to attach only to such lands as should be sown with exotic Cotton before the 15th July in each year. 7. If the experiments prove a failure, the Government will incur no expense whatever, but, if otherwise, it would only be just that those who incur the trouble and expense of the cultivation, and diffusion of the data, should participate in the general benefit which would be derived by the public at large. 8. The course I propose would, I think, tend to bring the question to a practical issue, as, by this means, private energy would be enlisted in its favour in the only available practical form—that of self-interest. 9. A very moderate amount of success would induce such a Society to persevere in8 their efforts, while individual attempts would be abandoned at the first serious (though it might turn out ultimately only temporary) failure. 10. It mav be inferred from the foregoing remarks that I have still considerable confidence in its ultimate success, but I cannot blind myself to the respectable testimony that has been brought against it, or to the difficulties that invariably present themselves in endeavouring to carry out a new system. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, H. BROOKE. • No. 1192 of 1859. Revenue Department. T o H. BROOKE, E sq., Bombay. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 10th instant, and to return to you the thanks of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council for 3^our interesting paper, which, with Dr. Forbes' report on early sown Cotton, and your further remarks contained in your communication of the 23rd idem, will be printed and circulated for general information, 2. His Lordship in Council cannot consent to foster particular modes of cultivation by special exemptions and privileges, being convinced that any conclusions based on the result of such culture must be fallacious. 3. He will, however, gladly offer every facility for the collection of data, such as you suggest. The result of the experiments hitherto tried is not such as to warrant their extension on a large scale, but it is desirable that further trials should be made this year, which Drs. Gibson and Forbes, and Mr. Daley, will be directed to carry out in the loca lities within reach of their supervision. 4. If you will prepare forms of Statements for recording the results, uniformity will be secured, and comparison will be easy. The periodical returns which you propose may be forwarded to the Secretariate, and will be there compiled. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, B. H.

Sir, 1 have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter, No. 1192 ot 1859, and having now received full accounts of the result of the experiments tried in Dharwar, I have the honour to submit them.9 The result of the daily sowings appears to me particularly interesting; The Cotton p.cked from the rows sown during a period of fourteen days for the early sowing and in penods of one month for the later sowings have been kept .separate, and present the following results up to 21st March: — Egyptian.

Basing a calculation therefore upon the result of the earliest sown fourteen days in each installed would give the following results:— Egyptian Cotton. Per Acre. Rows. Tolas. Rows. Tolas. Kupas.

It appears, therefore, that Egyptian should be sown in red soil by preference, but as regards American, it is matter of indifference which soil is made use of; it may be worth while to revert to the Native opinion that neither Egyptian nor American would flourish in red soil. The average quantity of Native or American Cotton obtained per acre in Dharwar does not exceed 60 lbs. of clean or rather dirty Cotton. It appears, therefore, sufficiently proved (as far as so small an experiment would permit) that the earlier the Cotton is sown the better. The second experiment of early sowing at Hooblee, was of three acres, sown in June, and one acre sown in September, as Natives usually plant, and the result of the three acres sown in June is as follows :— Sown 5—15 June, Native mode in drills .. 216 „ „ „ at 1 foot distance 185 401 „ 10—20 „ Native mode in drills .. 151 at 2 feet distance 184 335 Kupass or Seed Cotton.... 736 lbs.10 This produce of 736 lbs.

From the one acre sown in September I have no return yet, as on 21st March the Cotton was only then beginning to get ripe. THIRD EXPERIMENT AT BUNKAPOOR. Three acres Cotton sown 21st July—Black soil. The picking is not yet finished, but has produced thus far— Kupass.

It is stated, however, that the Cotton is of inferior quality. All these experiments appear to me to confirm my former view, that it is absolutely essential that the seed should be sown early, indeed as early as possible, and if so an advantageous return may be expected. As regards the experiments now directed by the Government to be tried by Drs. Gibson and Forbes, and Mr. Daley, I would suggest that, if the experiments are suffi ciently large to admit of it, it would be desirable to record the dates of sowing, the actual cost per 1,000 feet of each of the operations of digging, sowing, weeding, picking, prun ing, and second picking; and to record likewise the state of the weather for each day from the commencement of digging the ground to the conclusion of the experiment, viz. whether slight rain, much rain, or heavy rain ; whether cloudy or sunny, and the charac ter of the weather generally; whether dry hot wind, cool mild weather, or hot damp weather; the attacks of insects might also be recorded, and specimens preserved in Gin- gelly Oil, so as to show the character of the insects at different seasons. The shedding of bolls at certain seasons is likewise of great interest. If data of this description are fairly recorded, I cannot see any reason why we should not be able to discover the reason of any temporary or partial failure, and be able to devise a remedy. As regards the forms embodying the data that I have indicated above, it will pro bably be more satisfactory to Drs. Gibson and Forbes, that they should themselves prepare them, as their experience in such matters is so much superior to mine, and they will doubtless be able to improve on my suggestions. 1 have the honour to be.
