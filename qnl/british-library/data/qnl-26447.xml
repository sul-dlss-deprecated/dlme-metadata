His Majesty’s Government have endorsed this view# .OTIRP Rial DART 3.3* The Resident will, therefore, have authority when he goes to -Janaa, (i to inform the 1 am, If the latter proves obdurate, that the 'breaking off of negotiations will inevitably follow a failure to reach agreement! that he feels sure that His Majesty’s Government will not any longer tolerate the pr©senoe of heldl forces in territory which Ris Majesty’s Covernment claim for the Aden roteotorate, and that if negotiations are broken off His Majesty’s Government will in all 'probability feel compelled to assert forcibly tneir rights In Mi&amp;haXl and other territory occupied by £©l&amp;i forces, and (ii) to break off negotiations* It is hoped. %\m% if the Resident is placed in the position to make a statement as in (i , this wil' , in fact, clinch the negotiations and avoid the need for any forcible action for clearing the udhmli and other occupied territory# 4* It is realised that the decision to continue negotiations for a treaty may be regarded as a departure, in a strict sense, from the instructions approved earlier in the year to the affect that His Majesty’s Government had said their last word, but it is considered that the sufficient advance to justify the continuance of negotia te Imam- In reply to his letter of the 20th of une that ..la Majesty*s Government have authorised the iesi&amp;ent 0 proceed to ianaa, after Me return to Aden in U-m yut-unu, for the purpose of concluding a treatyj but that, in order that there may be no misapprehension, the l^- m muyt unael ’'’“ stand/that His Majesty’s Government require the trade ms® a letter of the 20th of June can be accepted liana* 1 accordingly request that you will now inform restrictionsrestrictions to 'be raised and the other preliminaries laid down in the Resident’s admonitory note to be carried out before the treaty j a actually 6lg'nM&gt; and that while the Heeldent will he prepared to diecuse certain variations of wording in the text of the treaty proposed in the I am’a letter, the secret annexe ®nnot he agreed to in any form. 6.

Further, His Majesty’s Government take the view that in any scheme for forcible recovery of territory occupied by Zeidi forces, it would not be possible to rely upon irregular tribal levies to carry out an organ ised attacks that their role should be limited to temporary occupation of territory when cleared by air action; and that it will, in the main, rest with the Royal Air yorce, not only to clear territory occupied by Zeidi forces, but also, if necessary, to prevent re-occupation of that territory by the threat or resumption of air action against military objectives in the I am’s territory. 8.

APPENDIX REL ATIONS OF HIS MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT ¥/ITH THE IMAM OF THE YEMEN . Recommendations of the Standing Official Suo-Committee ~ for Questions c*onc ernin g the Middle East . (l) (a) That there now seems a reasonable possibility of bringing the treaty negotiations to a successful conclusion if an envoy can be sent to Sanaa for personal discussion with the Imam; provided the envoy is previously authorised, should the Imam prove obdurate - (i) To inform the Imam that the breaking off of negotiations will inevitably follow failure by the Imam and the envoy to reach agreement; that the envoy feels sure that His Majesty’s Government will not any longer tolerate the presence^of Zeidi forces in territory which His Majesty’s Government claim for the Aden Protectorate; and that if negotiations are broken off, His Majesty’s Government will in all probability feel compelled to a,ssert forcibly their rights in Audhali, and other territory occupied by Zeidi forces. (ii) To break off negotiations. NOTE:- In point of fact, it is hoped that if the Resident is placed in a position to make a statement of this kind it willclinch, the negotiations and avoid the need for any forcible action for clearing the Audhali territory, but the envoy must have an assurance that, if necessary, His Majesty’s Government will use force to clear the Audhali country and other areas in the Protectorate occupied by Zeidi forces, as the position will be quite impossible unless an ultimatum can be sent to toe Imam after the negotiations are broken off. t o in That while continuance of negotiations for a^treaty may be regarded as a departure, in a strict sense, from the instructions approved earlier m the yeor to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had said their last wor/, the Imam’s letter can be accepted as a sufficient advance to justify the Acting Resident informing the Imam that tee Resident will come to Sanaa, on his return in . autumn for the purpose of concluding a tieatj, but that in order that there may be no rvi-i oarmrehension, the Imam must understand that His Majesty's Government require the trade restrictions be raised and the other preliminaries laid down the Resident's admonitory note to be carried out before the treaty is actually signed and that while the Resident will be prepared to discuss Otters of wording in the text of the treaty proposed by the Imam, the secret annexe cannot oe agreed to in any form. f \ in the event of action becoming necessary for 1 } ?he recovery of Audhali territory, it is essential that authority should be gi^n for brabing, after the usual warnings, suitable muat not be within Imamic territory, and that we must not be limited to local action in the friendly Audhali territory now occupied by the Zeidis and on our side of the boundary. fd') That in any scheme for forcible recovery of v a / inan in ay 7 ^-irH forces, it would not territory occupied by zeioi 1orc ■ * be possible to rely upon irregular tribal_ levies to carry out an organised attach; that their role3. should loe limited to temporary occupation of territory when cleared by air action; and that it will in the main rest with the Royal Air Force not only to clear territory occupied by Zeidi forces, but also, if necessary, to prevent reoccupation of that territory by the threat or resumption of air action against military objectives in the Imam’s territ ory. (e) That the Resident should have discretion to discuss and accept verbal amendments in the text of the treaty, but that the Colonial Office and the foreign Office should consider whether any of the particular amendments now suggested by the Imam must oe objected to.

(a) That as regards the incursion by Zeidi forces xnto the Subeihi country referred to in the Acting Resident’s telegram of the 14th August, 1933 (Paper No.M.E.(O) 101), the Acting Resident should be authorised to despatch an ultimatum to the Imam, concurrently with a notification to the Governor of Taiz, demanding withdrawal and restoration 0 ^ the prisoners and loot, to be followed m the event 0 . non-compliance by air action, after the usual local warnings, against Taiz or other suitable military^ objectives within the Imam’s territory in tne vicinity of the disturbed area. 0=) ( 0 ) ( 3 ). That the Foreign Office should take the necessary steps to advise the Italian Government of recent events in the Subeihi country, and the action which it is proposed to take. That action in connection with the incursion into the Subeihi country should be taken at the earli ■&gt; possible moment, allowing the minimum necessary time for the delivery of an ultimatum to the Ima:* a notification to the Italian Government.

As will he seen, the Imam, while purporting to accept our proposals-as they stand, in fact still hankers after a secret annex on the subject/ | \subject of the Islanus ana wishes also^ to make various other modifications, m addition, he is not apparently prepared at this stage to raise the embargo on trade with the protectorate. In these circumstances, ivx. Champion, with the support of the —• Aden, haa suggested that in view of the Inem's unwillingness to raise the embargo and his failure to accept the terms wnich he haa been informed were our last word, that we should cease to pursue the treaty negotiations, out indicated that it would simultaneously be necessary to take active steps to force the imam to evacuate the Auahali territory in the Aden protectorate, since trie exiecu on the Auahali dultan of a breakdown of negotiations unless accompanied by active steps to protect him against the Imam might be very unfortunate. 3. The natter was considered in ail its bearings in the i.laale ^ast Committee^ the i'ull i minutes of the uiscussion in which are self- explanatory. It will he seen that as a result it was agreed that heiore finally breaking with the Imam another attempt should be made to reach a settlement with him, despite the fact that this would to some extent represent a reversal ox the policy proposed at the Sub-Committee 1 s meeting oi 7th ivxtrch and subsequently approved by 4 * The matter is of only indirect concern to this Office. The Colonial Office are considering whether the conclusions of the Sub-Committee should be referred to the ministerial sub-Committee or to the Cabinet. So far as we are concerned, I submit that we need at this stage raise no objection and may agree to follow any course that commends itself1 THE SUB-COMMITTEE had before them the following papers dealing with the subject of relations with the Imam of the r-N Yemen ~ Copy of a despatch 3 dated 12th July* 1933 5 from the Acting Resident at Aden to the Secretary of State for the Colonies enclosing a reply from the Imam of the Yemen regarding the projected Treaty. (Paper No &lt;&gt; M.E.(O) 98). Copy of a despatch^ dated 12th July ? 1933 9 from the Acting Resident at Aden on the subject of the continued occupation of Audhali territory within our boundaries of the Aden Protectorate by the Imam of the Yemen s together with an appreciation by the Air Officer Commanding British Forces at Aden indicating a plan of action to ensure the withdrawal from this area of Yemen forces. (Paper No. M.E.(O) 99). Copy of a despatch 5 dated 12th July s 1933 5 from the Acting Resident at Aden&lt;, forwarding a copy of a letter from the Imam regarding the appointment of British representatives at Sanaa. (Paper No. M.E.(O) 100). Paraphrase copy of a telegram from the Resident at Aden 5 dated 14th August1933 ? reporting an incursion by Yemen forces into the south-west portion of the Aden Protectorates and asking for authority to bomb objectives in the Imam’s territory in order to secure evacuation. (Paper No. M.E.(O) lOl). THE CHAIRMAN stated that the meeting had originally been convened to consider two questions arising out of the Acting Resident’s despatches of the 12th July 3 viz. (a) whether treaty negotiations with the Imam were to be pursued; and (b) the measures to be taken to secure the evacuation by the Imam’s forces of Audhali and other territory^ in the event of negotiations being broken off. A telegram (Paper No. M.E.(O) lOl) had 9 however 3 just been received reporting a further inroad^ this time in another portion of the Aden Protectorates and this would need urgent consideration. CURSION MR. COWELL said that this area, inhabited by the Subeihi £0 BEIHI tribe, lay in the south western portion of the Protectorate, RRITORY . where the boundary with the Yemen had never actually been defined. A despatch, dated 2nd August, 1933, had just been received&gt; referring to this question and suggesting that the de-limitation of the 'boundary should he undertaken as soon as possible after the settlement of the Audhali question, 'this d espatch was 3 however 9 superseded by the telegram just received. COLONEL REILLY said that while a definite boundary in this area was shown on the map it had never been recognised by the Imam. The Lubeihi were a troublesome tribe s with whom the Resident had never been in close touch. Annual incursions by Zeidis into this region had t aken place., with the object of collecting taxes 3 which had actually been paid to the Imam. Should any modification of the boundary be discussed it was in this area that we could afford to make some concession 3 so long as we retained the coast line. He thought that this incursion was similar to the incident at A1 Ain in 1931, when an ultimatum sent to the Imam resulted in withdrawal. This question was bound up with the major question of breaking off negotiations and the evacuation of Audhali territory. TREATY At the Chairman’s suggestion the despatch (paper No, M.E.(O) NEGOTIA TIONS . 98) concerning the treaty was first considered, THE CHAIRMAN said that it was obviously impossible to accept the secret annexe regarding the islands in the Red Sea, v/hich had been proposed by the Imam. He also noted that the Imam had evaded specifying that the words 'southern frontier' referred to the Yemen. The other amendments, however, made by the Imam did not seem to be material. MR.WARNER .said that on these two points at any rate the Imam’s proposals were of real importance. He considered them entirely unacceptable. He pointed out that they were the latest of a long series of attempts to persuade His Majesty’s Government to give way on the same two matters. He was not prepared to express &amp;n opinion as to the importance of the other alterations proposed by the Imam without further examination in the Foreign 01 fice.3. MR. IAITHWAITE said that he agreed with Mr. Warner. The India Office were, not so closely concerned in this matter as the Foreign Office and the Oolonial Office, and he had no doubt that the Secretary of State for India would be prepared to accept any proposals which recommended themselves to the departments more closely concerned. At the same time, while obviously the Resident’s view on the question must carry very great weight, it was * only fair to point out in the first place that we had definitely intimated to the Imam tnat tne communication and the draft treaty already sent to him represented our last word; that if he was not prepared to negotiate on the basis then suggested to him negotiations must be broken off. It had also been quite definitely accepted in the previous discussions in the Middle East Committee that, while on general grounds a treaty settlement with the Imam was desirable, we had probably on the whole less to gain by it than the Imam: in other words that we could afford to wait and need be in no special hurry to press for a conclusion. We had long experience in negotiation with the Imam. He had never yet met any point of importance to us; but as the result of detailed correspondence ne continued to extract small concessions from us. Even now, while he had purported to have accepted our draft treaty as it stood, he was asking, as Mr. Champion pointed out, for certain concessions of major importance, and was pressing us to agree in a secret annexe to a formula which would he definitely compromising from oar point view as regards the islands. Moreover, it was open to question whetner we should not, by sending up an envoy to Sanaa, after the categorical statement previously made by us, and in face of failure by the Imam to accept our demands, lose a good deal of face. he aid not *asn to— r-&gt;. press these points, which were not primarily India Office points, hut they were clearly material to any decision the Committee might take. COLONEL REILLY feared that a situation might arise in which, the negotiations having keen broken off, His Majesty’s Government might nevertheless refuse to authorise the issue of an ultimatum, to he followed, if necessary, hy coercive action. We should then he faced with a deadlock in which the present unsatisfactory situation would continue to deteriorate without the prospect of a solution either hy negotiations or by force. This impasse might continue for several years, and would he very damaging to us politically. Rather than risk such a possibility he would prefer to continue negotiations in spite of the Imam’s obstinacy. Such an alternative was not, in his view, quite a hopeless one. With one exception the Imam’s modifications of our ’’final” terms did not appear to him to be necessarily or wholly unacceptable. The exception was the secret annexe, which was quite out of the question. Apart from this, the Imam's draft treaty did not strike him as being a had document. It was true that he rejected all words implying a recognition of the Protectorate, hut if he removes the trade restrictions and adjusts the boundaries as desired hy His Majesty’s Government, as he promised to do at the end of his letter, we shall have gained substantial advantages and an acknowledgment of the Protectorate in fact though not in name. On a strict construction of the letter sent to the Imam on the 11th April, it was not, he considered, essential that th trade restrictions should he raised before our eavoy, if aes patched, proceeded to Sanaa, hut they must oe raised before the treaty was actually concluued. He thought that if the Acting Resident’s recommendations for the breaking off of a treaty, to be followed by an ultima tum, were accepted in their entirety - well and good; and he was in favour of going forward on these lines. Bat if there, was to he any doubt or delay about the ultimatum and the5. recourse to force, he was inclined to close with the Imam’s draft, minus the secret annexe and subject to the removal of trade restrictions and the restoration of Protectorate territory and prisoners. Should this alternative he approved of, he thought that the best course would be for a British envoy to go to Sanaa to attempt to conclude a treaty on this basis. If the Imam proved refractory about the secret annexe or failed to remove the trade restrictions and to restore the territory and prisoners, or if he raises fresh obstacles, the envoy should be empowered to break off negotiations, and at the same time to inform the Imam of the probable consequences, namely that His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to allow him to remain indefinitely in occupation of what they regard as Protectorate territory and that, failing a peaceful withdrawal on his part, they would find it necessary to eject him by force. Unless the envoy was armed with this authority he thought further negotiations would be of no value. He hoped that a definite decision would be given on the above alternatives and that in any case negotiations would not be broken off without an assurance that forcible action would be taken to recover the areas now held by the Imam’s forces. MR. WARNER observed that the Resident’s letter to the Imam of the 11th April was to have been His Majesty's Government’s last word. It had been sent in accordance with a definite decision that if the Imam did not accept it in toto negotiations were to cease. The Imam had nevertheless proposed certain material alterations in the text of the treaty. He had also refused to raise the trade embargo, a step which His Majesty’s Government had insisted should precede any continuance of the negotiations. If the Sub-Committee now recommended that in spite of his6. attitude His Majesty’s Government should continue negotiations and even send an envoy to Sanaa, they should realise clearly that they were recommending a complete reversal of the previous decision. They should also consider whether such a step would not be considered a sign of weakness by the Imam, indeed n a climb-down u , whether it would not merely encourage him to think His Majesty’s Government were very anxious to make a treaty and would go on giving way indefinitely. He did not think that the Foreign Office would wish to oppose such a recommendation, if it was advocated by the Sub-Committee, in the light of the Resident’s views and of somewhat changed circumstances; but it was important that there should be no misunderstanding as to the complete reversal of policy which would be involved and the possible consequences. MR. LAITHWAITE expressed his agreement with Mr. Warner’s views. Was it contemplated that we should secure a specific withdrawal of the proposal for a secret annexe as a condition of any visit by the Resident? COLONEL REILLY proposed that the Acting Resident at Aden should inform the Imam in a letter that on no account could the secret annexe be considered, and also refer to the fact that he had agreed to comply with the contents of the admonitory document, i.e., our demands, but that His Majesty’s Government expected this to be done before the Treaty was signed. MR. GRIEVE said that he was in favour of the second alternative proposed by Colonel Reilly, i.e., the continua tion of negotiations by the despatch of an envoy to Sanaa. He did not think that any loss of face would result from accepting the wording now proposed by the Imam, which gave us materially all we asked for. Should negotiations beToroiten off, and not followed up by any coercive measures, there would be no finality, dnd merely a more frequent re currence of inroads. He asked to what extent the Imam had control over his subordinate governors, who were, possibly, ^ the originators of these raids. COLOhnL RnlLLY said that from experience he had found that the Imam had effective control over his local officers, who acted on his instructions certainly as regards all major matters, GROUP CAPTAIN HARRIS thought that the plan of action proposed in paragraph 12(ii) of the appreciation by the Officer Commanding British Forces in Aden would be successful and should secure lasting results. The plan proposed in paragraph 12(i) of that appreciation was unsound for the reasons therein given and should not therefore be attempted. He insisted that it was necessary for the Royal Air Force to be allowed to take action against military objectives in Imamic territory, after the usual local warnings had been given. He thought it would be a great mistake to detail the selected objectives in the actual ultimatum. They must be free to select them as the operations proceeded. By bombing military objectives within Imamic territory the Imam could be made anxious even about Sanaa. His anxiety about Sanaa was a very material factor in the speedy and successful issue of the Dhala operations in 1928. He was of the opinion that the longer the existing state of affairs persisted, the bigger would be the effort eventually re quired to turn out the Zeidis should negotiations break down. For nine years the Audhalis had had to rest content with assurances: there were signs that both their patience and their co-operation could not be counted upon indefinitely and that their ardour might wane. COLONEL REILLY said that from his experience of the Dhala operation in 1928, when air action against forts and places well within the Imam’s territory had been effective, the threat of air action would act as a deterrent and prevent future incursions. He pointed out that the area around Rada, one of the suggested objectives, was inhabited by Zeidis,who were of the Imam’s own sect. Action against them wouldj, therefore 9 probably be the most effective way of bringing pressure to bear* He thought that the air action suggested would succeed in clearing the Audhali country and regaining control* The Audhalis 9 however 5 could not be relied upon to hold this tract against the Zeidis without the aid of air action* LIEUT* COLONEL HENDERSON said that the War Office were in favour of negotiations being continued and any precipitate action avoided* Their reasons were that they did not feel happy regarding the proposed use of Arab tribal levies? which had been proved unreliable* Tne War Office had information that the Imam had a fairly powerful and efficient fighting force? consisting of some 12?500 regular troops? with some 30?000 armed tribesmen? equipped, with armoured cars? machine guns? artillery and aircraft * Should the Imam show fight and take counter measures a big commitment might be involved* COLONEL ISMAY hoped that too much would not be expected of the tribal force that it was proposed ^o employ* Forces of this kind were occasionally useful in following up after a successful attack? and collecting any loot that might be available? but they were generally valueless for any military operations in the proper sense of that term? and it would be optimistic to expect them to remain in effective occupation oi a captured area for any appreciable time. It was? he suggested? a pity to incur implicit responsibility for scallywags of this kind by employing a British officer to ”control and direct” them? but he presumed that the military phraseology employed in the appreciation was not intended to be taken too literally* 8 0GROUP CAPTAIN HARRIS said that the Air Ministry did not regard the tribal levies other than as 'moppers up' to enter and re-occupy territory as the Zeidis withdrew. He pointed out that this was clearly indicated in the selected plan 0 The Air Ministry deprecated the use of levies and irregulars as the main attack for precisely the reasons advanced by Colonel Ismay. It was the air attack on objectives in Imamic territory upon which they relied to induce the Imam to order a withdrawal 9 and his forces to commence one,, The tribal levies would be used to follow up the withdrawal., COLONEL REILLY observed that in the Dhala operation of 1928 ? the friendly Arabs did put up an effective resistance to Zeidi counter attack. After the country is occupied these tribesmen must undoubtedly dissolve and revert to their normal occupations. This was ? in hiscpinion 9 a further argument that the Air Force must have authority to attack targets outside our own borders., which was the really effective counter measure. THE CHAIRMAN stated that the general feeling of the meeting appeared to be in favour of continuing negotiations 9 but that if these cannot be brought to a satisfactory conclusion it will be necessary to take action against the Imam to compel the evacuation of the Audhali and other territory of the Proteccorate now held by him. It was 9 in the view of the Sub- Committee 5 essential that this action should be taken against targets in Zeidi territory. It was necessary to lay the whole case before Ministers 9 and he proposed to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies for a decision as to whether this question should be laid before the Ministerial Committee or await a meeting of the Cabinet.10. As regards the recent incursion into Subeihi territory., it might perhaps he thought that air action would he covered by the Cabinet decision of 19C6 , to the effect that the Imam should be warned that retaliatory measures would be taken to prevent incur sions; but he was clear that^ in present circumstances, reference to Ministers was necessary. MR. WARNER explained that he could not commit the Foreign Office on this point. In any case, if it were decided to take forcible action against the Imam,it would be necessary to notify the Italian Government beforehand and explain the circumstances. Relations between Ibn Saud and the Imam were at present very strained; Ibn Saud had appealed to His Majesty’s Govern ment for assistance, which they were unable to give; but His Majesty's Government had made representations to the Italian Government on the basis of the understanding reached in Rome in 1927, under which the two Governments agreed (1) to do their utmost to prevent conflicts betv/een Ibn Saud and the Imam and (2) in case of such a conflict not to intervene. If His Majesty’s Government were suddenly to take forcible action against the Yemen, such action might well be misunderstood in Rome as a form of intervention on behalf of Ibn Saud. It was the more necessary to explain matters to the Italian Government before any ultimatum was delivered to the Imam, in that a precisely similar situation had arisen in 1931 when His Majesty’s Government presented him with an ultimatum to evacuate A1 Ain when relations between him and Ibn Saud v/ere strained. Prior explanations had then been given to the Italian Government.11. CONCLUSIONS. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed (l) (a) That there now seems a reasonable possi bility of bringing the treaty negotiations to a successful conclusion if an envoy can be sent to Sanaa for personal discussion with the Imam; provided the envoy is pre viously authorised * should the Imam prove obdurate - (i) To inform the Imam that the breaking off of negotiations will inevitably follow failure by the Imam and the envoy to reach agreement; that the envoy feels sure that His Majesty’s Government will not any longer tolerate the presence of Zeidi forces in territory which His Majesty’s Government claim for the Aden Protectorate; and that if negotiations are broken off 5 His Majesty’s Govern ment will in all probability feel compelled to assert forcibly their rights in Audhali and other territory occupied by Zeidi forces. (ii) To break off negotiations. Note. In point of fact s it is hoped that if the Resident is placed in a position to make a statement of this kind it will clinch the negotiations and avoid the need for any forcible action for clearing the Audhali territory 5 but the envoy must have an assurance that s if necessary, His Majesty’s Government will use force to clear the Audhali country and other areas in the protectorate occupied by Zeidi forces, as the position will be quite impossible unless an ultimatum can be sent to the Imam after the negotiations are broken off. (b) That while continuance of negotiations for a treaty may be regarded as a departure, in a strict sense, from the instructions approved earlier in the year to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had said their last word, the Imam’s let'cer can be accepted as a sufficient advance to justify the Acting Resident informing the Imam that the Resident will come to Sanaa on his return in the autumn for the purpose of concluding a treaty; but that in order that there may be no misapprehension, the Imam must understand that His Majesty’s Government require the trade restrictions to be raised and the other preliminaries laid down in the Resident's admonitory note to be carried out before the treaty is actually signed, and that while the Resident will be prepared to discuss matters of wording in the text of the treaty proposed by the Imam, the secret annexe cannot be agreed to in any form.(c) That in the event of action becoming necessary for the recovery of Audhali territory^ it is essential that authority should be given for bombing s after the usual warnings 3 suitable military objectives within Imamic territory * and that we must not be limited to local action in the friendly Audhali territory now occupied by the Zeidis and on our side of the boundary* (a) * yj 1 That in any scheme for forcible recovery of territory occupied by Zeidi forces* it would • v not be possible to rely upon irregular tribal levies as urn ._af t p c A i. .n e ; that their role should be limited to temporary occupation of territory when cleared by air action; and that it will in the main rest with the Royal Air Force not only to clear territory occupied by Zeidi forces* but also* if necessary* to prevent re-occupation of that territory by the threat or resumption of air action against military objectives in the Imam’s territory. /(e) That the Resident should have discretion to discuss and accept verbal amendments in the text of the treaty* but that the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office should consider whether any of the particular 1 amendments now suggested by the Imam must be objected to. (2) (a) That as regards the incursion by Zeidi forces into the Subeihi country referred to in the Acting Resident’s telegram of the 14th August* 1933 (Paper No. M.E.(0) 101)* the Acting Resident should be authorised to des patch an ultimatum to the Imam * concurrently with a notification to the Governor of Taiz* demanding withdrawal and restoration of the prisoners and loot* to be followed in the event of non-compliance by air action* after the usual local warnings* against Taiz or other suitable military objectives within the Imam’s territory in the vicinity of the disturbed area. (b) That the Foreign Office should tahe the necessary steps to advise the Italian Govern ment of recent events in the Subeihi country and the action which it is proposed to take. (c) That action in connection with the incursion into the Subeihi country should be taken at the earliest possible moment* allowing the minimum necessary time for the delivery of an ultimatum to the Imam and of notifica tion to the Italian Government. (3) That the Colonial Office should take the instruc tions of the Secretary of State for the Colonies* as Chairman of the Standing Ministerial Sub committee for Questions concerning the Middle East* whether the action to be talien on the despatches and telegram from the Acting Resident under dis cussion should be submitted to the Ministerial Sub-Committee or to the Cabinet.

REVISE. 4 * No. SfcyM 1 AilGtsS The ACTING RESIDENT to the SECRETARY OF STATE. (Received 24th July, 1933.) [Answered by No. ]. (Secret.) (No. 162.) g 1R&lt; The Residency, Aden, 12th July, 1933. I have the honour to refer to Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly’s Secret despatch No, 83 of the 12th April, 1933,* and to enclose herewith translations of a letter dated the 20th June, 1933, from the Imam, and of a draft Treaty and a secret appendix that were attached thereto. 2. The Imam c&lt; completely and wholly accepts ” His Majesty’s Government’s draft of the Treaty, and states that he will comply with the terms of Colonel Reilly’s letter of the 11th April, 1933, and of the Note (or ‘ c admonitory document ”) annexed thereto : he then characteristically submits a new draft that embodies three major modifications and ten minor amendments of His Majesty’s Government’s final terms, and concludes his letter with a sentence that means that he has no present intention of removing the restrictions on overland trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate until the Treaty has been signed. 3. The three major modifications referred to are as follows :— (i) In Article HI the words “ of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen ” have been omitted, presumably with the object of avoiding any commitment that would imply the limitation of the Imam’s territories by “ the frontier.” The last clause of the same Article reads, . . . . and any interference by their subjects or from their side of that frontier, &amp;c., . . ._. ” ; and I take it that the omission of the words £ ‘ by persons under their protection ” is similarly a veiled rejection of our position in the Protectorate. (ii) In Article V (1) the Imam has reverted to the text of his draft of September, 1930, by re-wordmg, ££ . . . . and shall receive ecpial treatment to that enjoyed by the subjects of a most favoured Power.” He has, nevertheless^ retained the suggestion of national treatment in the words shall be amen able to the local laws and judgments ” (cf., paragraph 3 of Colonel Reilly s Secret despatch No. 157 of the 17th August, 19321). ^ (iii) Drawing (as he says) an inference from paragraph 6 of Colonel Reilly s letter of the 11th April, the Imam has put forward a new sepret Article, complementary to Article III, in which he seeks to bind His Majesty s Government to formal (if covert) recognition of his reversionary interests in the Islands of the Yemen, to the definite furtherance of those interests and to abstention from connivance in the violation of his fundamental rights ” in that respect. 4. The ten minor amendments referred to are as follows:—^ (i) Article I. The Imam desires the additions of the words and His Govern- men ” after the words ££ India ” and ££ Yemen ” respectively. I concede that he fears the impermanence of human affairs, and especially or is own, and hopes by these means to secure the Treaty from the accidents or political change. A (ii) Article IV. The Imam, in an obscure comment based on a play upon words, argues that international practice is inferior to the international pnncip es by which it is governed; and he deletes the former word. (iii) ArticleV (1). 'For reasons not explained, the words From the date oi ^ the coming into force of the present Treaty ” are omitted from the Imam s draft. . &gt;&gt; (iv) For the words ££ . . . . subjects of the one High Contracting par y • . • • &gt; the Imam proposes ££ . . . . subjects of each of the Hig n rac i g parties ? ^ (v) To the words ££ . . . . local laws ” the Imam adds ££ and Judgments, , (vi) Article V (2). As in (iv) above. ' ,, , • • (vii) The Imam omits the words ££ and passengers for the reason a , in view, foreign passengers in a British vessel could (according o _ Majesty’s Government’s draft) claim equal treatment with Bn is su ye in a Yemeni port. * No 17957/33 [No. 40]. t No. C 97857/32 [No. 170]. Aden.—Gp. 6. 131/2963. 24. 24. 8/33. (16264) M. &amp; S.T] le wo rds “ of the territories ” are omitted in the Imam s draft, on the V111 somewhat obscure grounds that “ coasts which have no territories have no norts ” This argument is so unintelligible that its intention is far to seek and I am inclined to think that the Imam hesitates to accept here possible implication that the Protectorate is British territory, i.e., that A- n , 1 /'Pi ' \ 'ID ™ .'X-f /rf .T’v V* Q ■ f'Zi (ix) (x) Aden is a port of the (British) Protectorate. , , , . . , Article V (3). The Imam omits the whole of this clause of definition, for the ostensible reason that £ £ the interpretation of the meaning of the texts of Articles in Treaties is unusual.” Here again I presume that the Imam s motive is the rejection of any reference in the treaty to our protective obligations and position in the Protectorate. , rp + • Article VII The Imam, while accepting the conclusion of the treaty m bilingual texts, insists that the Arabic text shall be the basis for subsequent interpretation of any of its clauses. . . . . 5. My appreciation of the Imam’s present attitude^ is that, pre-occupied by events in Hair an and by negotiations with the Sa’udi Mission at bana a m that con nexion worried by Italian demands for a financial settlement and harassed by his own ill-health and the uncertainties of the succession, he has taken the me o utmost caution and has subjected His Majesty’s Government s draft of the treaty to the very closest search to discover the remotest potentialities of danger to his interests, that he has carried this policy to an extreme, in the present instance, may indicate the existence of influences at Sana’a, both foreign and local, that are hostile to the i ieaty and are working on the suspicions of a sick and aged man. 6. However that may be, the fact is that there is little m the Imam s present communication to indicate that he has made any real advance towards reconciliation. On the contrary, and in spite of the very explicit statement of the finality of His Majesty’s Government’s conditions, conveyed to him m Colonel Reilly s letter of the 11th April, 1933, he seems almost to have gone out of his way to throw up new obstacles to a settlement; and he has refused to relax his Determination to continue to enforce the restrictions on overland trade, pending signature of the Treaty. 7. In these circumstances it seems clear that no good purpose can be served bv a continuance of inconclusive bargaining, and in accordance with the sense of the instructions contained in your telegram No. 10 of the 25th March, 1933, # I would propose to inform the Imam, that in view of his refusal to remove the overland trade restrictions until the Treaty is signed, I have been instructed to suspend fiuther cone- spondence and negotiations with him in regard to the Treaty. 8. I am recommending to you in a separate despatch the desirability for armed intervention to restore to the ’Audhali Sultan that part of his territory (Adh Dhahii) which is occupied by the Imam, and to effect the release of ’Audhali hostages now in Zeidi hands. In confining the reasons for the suspension of Treaty negotiations solely to the Imam’s refusal to remove the trade restrictions, 1 have in mind the considera tion that any adverse criticism, to the effect that the Treaty will have been pressed on the Imam by. threat of force, may be adequately met by the clear separation of the two issues; for while the suspension of negotiations for the establishment of friendly relations is justified by the Imam’s persistence in an unfriendly act in the 1 form of the Trade Embargo, the deliverance of the territories and tribes of the ’Audhali Sultan (which His Majesty’s Government are bound by treaty to protect) from eight year si of armed and oppressive Zeidi domination, is in itself an act of justice, which is overdue, and which will become opportune on the breakdown (for other reasons) of the Treaty negotiations with the Imam. 9. If these ’Audhali operations are approved, their successful conclusion may be expected to impress the Imam with the fact that His Majesty’s Government are deter mined to safeguard their legitimate interests in the Aden Protectorate; and it may facilitate a solution of the embargo problem. Otherwise, it is probable that the suspension of the Treaty negotiations will result in a prolonged deadlock, to the detri ment of British prestige in south-west Arabia generally, and to the prejudice of peace and material prosperity in the Aden Protectorate particularly. 10. I therefore request that these considerations mav have your favourable attention and that I may receive your instructions at an early date in regard to my communication of the decision of His Majesty’s Government to the Imam. In the meantime I have not replied to the Imam’s letter. I have, &amp;c., R. S.

After Compliments. We beg to acknowledge with pleasure your esteemed letter No. C/206 dated 16th April, 1933 (16th Dhul Hijja 1351) which we have carefully perused and considered. We understand from the present situation that His Majesty’s Government are reluctant to grant us our demands by reason of some wrong impression they may be entertaining towards us. We have been making repeated insistence on some points only in order to secure certain particular demands which we considered to be very essential for us. His Majesty’s Government, on the other hand, have not been able to check themselves from suspicions and doubts that the object of our persistence is the intention on our part to take some action prejudicial to the aims and important interests of His Majesty’s Government, after the conclusion of the Treaty. We wish to give you now a further assurance that the history of our Government is free from the stigma of treachery and the breaking of engagements and promises. It is, thanks to God, completely and wholly innocent of this. W T e most confidently assert that we are the one Nation which has not violated its engagements, neither during this regime, nor throughout all the time of its existence in the world, although we are utterly poor and weak. The pages of history are seen by all. After the conclusion of the Treaty and the establishment of friendly relations, we are prepared to maintain all its direct and indirect objects. We will never act against one who is in treaty and friendly relations with us. We boast of our sincerity, in the beginning and in the end, and we deem it desirable to submit this preamble in confirmation, although it is not necessary to do so. We consider that the submission of these representations to His Majesty’s Government now, before the commencement of the Treaty that is to be concluded, will serve a useful purpose. Having made this essential preface there is something which we feel bound to say. We tender and express our thankfulness to our honourable correspondent, Colonel Reilly, for his good will, skill, zeal, and ' intelligence, of which we are certain from beginning to end, and for his continued praiseworthy deeds. It is the nature of the Yemenis to regard or esteem one who maintains friendship towards them and to express their undoubted thankfulness to one loyal to them. Colonel Reilly! Firstly, the draft Treaty that you have sent on this occasion has been completely and wholly accepted. Secondly, it has been decided by us to comply with your esteemed letter, together with the contents of the admonitory document annexed thereto. Thirdly, we hasten to explain to Your Excellency that it is our intention utterly to prevent every obstruction and contravention, by the Grace of God. Fourthly, we therefore request Your Excellency kindly to complete the means for the signing of the Treaty. We have, however, made an addition only of the words Cf and His Government,” in Article I of the Treaty, as it is absolutely necessary for both contracting parties. In the important Article III we consider the sentence, “ of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen ” to be superfluous and unnecessary, because this Treaty that is being concluded, basically concerns the territories of the Yemen, and the text of the Treaty has no concern with other than the Yemen and Great Britain. We also consider that there is no necessity for the inclusion of the phrase, “ or by persons under their protection,” in the said Article, because the undertaking by each of the two parties to prevent transgression by any person of those on his side is complete and guaranteed. Article IV is accepted, with the exception of the word “ practice,” which we consider unnecessary; for there is no £ 4 custom ’ ’ in International Law but -the C£ practice ” of the said Law implies its fundamental and exclusive principle. We have been compelled to omit the word c£ passengers,” in Article V, because £c passengers ” naturally include different kinds and origins of people, and comprise subjects of various nations. It is obvious that all passengers in general cannot be considered to be British subjects, for surely there may be among the passengers some of the subjects of other Governments, while in fact the Treaty concerns the British Government. We have no intention to make a pact in respect of all Powers in general. Passengers are subject to certain particular regulations and are not normally to be included in such a pact.

This secret appendix will convince Ad serle as anhsurance to us, and will be the absolute cause of our reaching permanent agreement with full confidence in His Majesty’s Government m every lespect. ' We are certain that His Majesty’s Government will after the conclusion of the Treaty find us to he most friendly and sincere to them, and the ill intentions and evil objects of those who were the cause of mistrust will be proved; and there will be repentance for what happened, by the Grace of God. , , , In the circumstances explained we anxiously await Your Excellency s return to vour high post from England in October next, m sound health, and bearing these demands. We shall be extremely grateful if you will hasten your coming to us to complete and sign the Treaty. By the mere (or immediately on) signing of he Treaty, the restrictionswill be removed and the boundaries adjusted as desired by you, in a fit and proper way. In conclusion we request you to accept our best compliments. Dated 25th Safar 1933. = 20th June, 1933. Draft Treaty. (Submitted by the Imam.) Preamble. His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India on the one part, and His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam, on the other part. Being desirous of entering into a treaty on a basis of friendship and co-operation for their mutual benefit. . , . Have resolved to conclude this Treaty and have appointed as tneir Plenipotentiaries: _ . , His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyon the Seas, Emperor of India. For Great Britain and Northern Ireland : His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam : Who having communicated their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed as follows :—Article 11. There shall always be peace and friendship between the High Contracting parties, who undertake to maintain good relations with each other in every respect. Article 111. The settlement of the question of the southern frontier's deferred pending the. conclusion in whatever way may be agreed upon by both High Contracting Parties in a spirit of friendship and complete concord, free from any dispute or difference, of the negotiations which shall take place between them before the expiry of the period of the present Treaty. Pending the conclusion of the negotiations referred to in the preceding paragraph, the High Contracting Parties agree to maintain the situation existing in regard to the frontier pn the date of the signature of this Treatv, and both High Contracting Parties undertake that they will prevent by all means at their disposal any violation by their forces of the above-mentioned frontier, and any interference by.their subjects or from their side of that frontier with the affairs of the people inhabiting the other side of the said frontier. Article IV. After the coming into force of the present Treaty, the High Contracting Parties shall by mutual agreement and concord enter into such agreements as shall be necessary for the regulation of commercial and economic affairs, based on general international principles. Article V. A The subjects of each of the High Contracting Parties who wisht^-trade in the territories of the other, shall be amenable to the local laws and juagmebts and shall receive equal treatment to that enjoyed by the subjects of a most-favoured Power. Similarly the vessels of each of the Contracting Parties and their cargoes shall in the ports of the 'Hilier receive similar treatment to that enjoyed by the vessels and cargoes of a most-favoured Power. Af\ Article VI This Treaty shall be the basis of all subsequent agreements that may be concluded between the High Contracting Parties now and in the future for the purposes of friendship and amity. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to assist nor to connive at any action directed against the friendship and concord now existing between them. Article VII. The present Treaty shall be ratified as soon as possible after signature and the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged at Sana’a. It shall come into- force on the date of the exchange of ratifications and shall thereafter remain in force for a period of 40 years. In witness whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Treaty and have affixed thereto their Seals. Done at Sana’a in English and Arabic, and should doubt arise as to the interpreta tion of any of these articles, both parties shall rely upon the Arabic text. Secret Appendix. This is a Secret Article supplementary to the original Article III of the Treaty concluded between the Government of Great Britain and the Government of the Yemen. As was declared in this Article III, the two High Contracting Governments under take to enter into negotiations regarding the territories under discussion withug the 40 years which is the period of this Treaty, in a most friendly and honourable spirit: they agree to solve and dispose of the case between them, and not to open a way or possibility for any dispute, difference, or hostility between them. And whereas there are certain of the Islands of the Yemen which must un doubtedly revert to the Yemen, and whiqh nevertheless have not hitherto been surrendered and restored to their source since the end of the Great War, His Majesty’s Government engage to maintain and safeguard the said reversion and not to assist in the creation of any violation of the fundamental and natural rights (of the Yemen) in this respect.'HIS HOCUKEM' IS THE PROPJjIRTT OP HIS BRITARTUC LP.JHST Y ?

(No. 163.) g IRj The Residency, Aden, 12th July, 1933. I have the honour to refer to Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly s Secret despatch No. 83 of the 12th April, 1933, # on the subject of treaty negotiations with the Yemen. 2. The Imam has now replied to Colonel Reilly’s communication to him of the 11th April, 1933, in a sense that indicates his rejection of the text that had been laid before him clearly as the final terms acceptable to His Majesty’s Government. He has also refused to agree to the present removal of trade restrictions on the frontier, that His Majesty’s Government have insisted on as a condition of the continuance of negotia tions; and I have recommended to you in a separate despatch! in that connexion that the negotiations should be broken off for that reason. 3^ The suspension of these negotiations is likely to result in a deadlock, and I fear that the situation may continue to drift indefinitely in the sense suggested by Colonel Reilly in his demi-official letter to Mr. Cowell of the 15th February, 19334 4. The fact of such a suspension will certainly have a serious reaction on the attitude of the ’Audhali Sultan, in regard to whom there has lately been increasing justification for alarm lest his accumulated grievances against the Imam, for the harsh treatment that he and his tribesmen have received and continue to receive at Zeidi hands, may drive him to some aggressive and retaliatory act. _ For although it has been the consistent practice of the' Residency during the past eight years, to exhort and advise the ’Audhali Sultan to hold his hands in patience, and to rely on the peaceful measures that His Majesty’s Government have been adopting to effect the restoration of his territory and tribesmen, his forbearance, strained by years of unsatisfied complaint, has latety been brought to breaking point by the immoderate and oppressive acts of the Zeidi Amil of A1 Beldha, in the ’Audhali region on Adh Dhahir that is occupied by the Imam. 5. The Sultan has hitherto loyally, if reluctantly, complied with our wishes, and has acted as correctly as could have been expected under very exasperating conditions; and the Political Secretary’s task of attempting to satisfy his frequent invocations of his Treaty of Protection has not been free from embarrassment. In order that the justification for the Sultan’s complaints may be more fully appreciated I enclose herewith a summary of the incidents upon which they are based. 6. It is not to be thought that I anticipate the launching of an organized attack by the ’Audhali Sultan on Zeidi forces on Adh Dhahir against our wishes and without our support: he fully realizes that he could not carry it to success. What I fear is that as the result of further hostile or slighting Zeidi acts, and of his final comprehension that the Treaty negotiations in which he'has doubtfully relied to recover his rights have been suspended, he may either precipitate open hostilities on the border by incautious intrigues or by raids, or retire with all the loyal members of the ruling family, and leave his territory open to occupation by the Imam. 7. The danger of the latter alternative is accentuated _ by the presence on Adh Dhahir and in close relations with the Zeidi Amil of A1 Beidha, of the family of the previous ’Audhali Sultan, who was murdered by the present incumbent in 1928. As a result of this murder a bitter feud exists between the two branches of the family. It is moreover important to consider that Zeidi occupation of the south-eastern Audhah territory below Adh Dhahir would give the Imam comparatively easy access to the sea. and would facilitate the isolation from Aden of the Hadhramaut, Beihan, the Wahidi, and the three ’ Aulaqi regions (which supply the majority of and the best recruits for the Aden Protectorate Levies and the Aden Armed Police). 8. For the reasons outlined above the necessity for compelling Zeidi evacuation of occupied Protectorate territory has become increasingly apparent. As there is little prospect, either now or in the near future, of fulfilling our protective obligations to the ’Audhah Sultan by peaceful means, I have considered it desirable to examine in detail a scheme of operations for the expulsion of Zeidi forces from Adh Dhahir and for the restoration of ’Audhali hostages who are still in the Imam’s hands.

A letter of protest from the Residency brought no satisfaction; and the ’Amil of Al Beidha claimed Ahl Bura’a as being part of Ahl Barkan under his control, and on his part, complained against the ’Audhaii Sultan for interfering with ’Audhali tribesmen who were under tlie control of the Imam. The Residency expressed the intention not to interfere between the ’Audhali Sultan and his own subjects and made it clear that His Majesty s Government did not recognize the right of the Imam to occupy ’Audhali territory. July, 1932.—The ’Amil of Al Beidha, under orders from the Imam, closed the route through ’Audhali territory to trade from Al Beidha to Aden. At the same time, the ’Amil, on his own initiative, entered into' a trade agreement with the Lower Yafa’i Sultan, who is in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, for the safe conveyance of trade through Yafa’i territory. October, 1932.—Under pressure from the Residency, the Lower Yafa’i Sultan cancelled the above agreement, and this fact, coupled with the prevention of caravans for ill Beidha from leaving Aden, compelled the ’Amil to reopen the ’Audhali route.

T. Boyd, O.B.E., M.C., A.F.O., Officer Commanding, British Forces at Aden, for the Chief Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief, Aden. Review of the Situation. 1. In 1925, in furtherance of a policy of encroachment on the Aden Protectorate which had been pursued almost continuously by the Imam of the Yemen since the end of the War of 1914-18, Zeidi forces occupied tribal territory belonging to the ’Audhali both in Adh Dhahir on the top of Al Kor, and in Al Hadhn below. They were, how ever, driven back by tribal action, with the assistance of three Bristol lighter aircraft of the Aden Flight based on Shuqra. Air operations were confined to the bombing of Zeidi troops in Adh Dhahir and the Zeidi headquarters in Al Hadhn in the villages of Az Zara and Lodar, and ceased as soon as both areas had been cleared of the invaders. Within two days of the withdrawal of the air support, the Zeidi forces successfully reoccupied Adh Dhahir, and the ’Audhali tribesmen retired to Al Hadhn at the foot of Al Kor owing, so they alleged at the time, to a lack of ammunition and supplies. The Zeidi reoccupation stopped short at the crest of Al Kor, leaving Al Pladhn in, the hands of the ’Audhali Sultan. 2. The indecisive result of these operations appears to have been due to the following causes :— (i) Aircraft had only short range and small bomb carrying capacity. (ii) Insufficient aircraft were available. (hi) Lack of advanced landing grounds—Shuqra only being available.V Civ'l lack of tribal co-operation. No British Officer was sent to control and ( ‘ V) co oXate the operations of the tribesmen, nor was wireless telegraphy or any other adequate method of communication between the Audhahs (v) The aircraft did not strike far enough back with the result that the Imam, ( who was too remote to feel the effects of the bombing, was m no way deterred from ordering the reoccupation of ’Audi,ah territory at the first S Since 1 mT the Zeidis have remained in occupation of Adh Dhahir Plateau The'’Audhah Sesmen of'the occupied area, who are at heart loyal to the ’Audi,ah Xan with the notable exception of the near relations of Ins predecessor, and their sm U following) have been disarmed and are subjected to the severest oppression and maltreatment by the Zeidi authorities in Al Berdha “ f^ hopeX to recognize the permanent authority of the Imaim The /enlis ai, i op . _r means to force the ’Audhah Sultan, who now resides m Az Zara at the^foot of Al Koi, to break his treaty with His Majesty’s Government and to transfer his allegiance to the Imarn^ ;s a]readv tellinf j on the tribesmen of Adh Dhahir, and both they and the ’Audhali Sultan realize that they are dependent on British assistance if the occupied territory is to be freed from the Zeidi yoke. The Sultan is however, disappointed and disheartened by the fact that such ass,stance has not yet been forth- coming. The Aim to he Attained. 5. To compel the Imam of the Yemen to withdraw all Zeidi forces from ’Audhah territory on Adh Dhahir Plateau. Factors affecting the Attainment of the Aim. 6. Time and Space .— (i) The situation is rapidly approaching a point where fresh developments are almost inevitable, and unless we are prepared to assist the Audhah sue i developments may eventually have very adverse effects on the rest of tne Aden Protectorate, and may necessitate a greater military effort than is now required. . . (ii) Weather conditions in the spring normally bring about the formation ot heavy cloud masses over Adh Dhahir plateau and the edge of Al Kor, which would seriously impede both air and ground operations. During the summer and autumn meteorological conditions are generally favourable, (hi) Adh Dhahir Plateau is situated approximately 100 miles from Aden and 5 miles from Lodar—the capital of the ’Audhali Sultan. (iv) Rada’, a Zeidi garrison town through which the lines of communication between Al Beidha and Sana’a pass, is 120 miles from Aden, and is there fore within easy flying range. (v) Advanced landing grounds exist in numerous parts of the Aden Protectorate, which bring all possible air objectives both in the occupied area and in Zeidi territory within effective bombing range. 7. Relative Strengths.—— (i) Zeidi Forces. —The latest intelligence reports estimate the strength of the Zeidi forces in Al Beidha district including Adh Dhahir, as about 1,500. In the event of protracted operations, or for the purpose of launching a counter attack, these could be strongly reinforced by troops from the Yemen after some delay. They include about 400 regulars, but the remainder are comparatively well armed and amenable to control. (ii) 'Audhali Forces. —The estimated number of ’Audhali fighting men avail able in Al Hadhn district for offensive operations against the Zeidis on the top of Al Kor is 2,700. The majority of these are in possession of arms, but an issue of rifles and ammunition would be required to increase the proportion and k&gt; replace unserviceable arms and arms for which ammunition is not available (Martini-Henry). 650 rifles for this purpose are at present held by the Aden Residency. (hi) Possible ’Auddiali Allies. —The ’Audhali are on peaceable terms with their neighbouring tribes, who would almost certainly come to their assistance(16263) in an attempt to recapture Adh Dhahir plateau. These tribes could probably muster a total of approximately 2,000 fighting men, but would also have to be assisted with the grant of rifles and ammunition. In the event of a serious initial reverse this support would probably melt away. (iv) All the forces mentioned under (ii) and (hi) above fight as tribesmen, are entirely unorganized and would never submit to the central control of any one of their own tribal leaders. Only a British officer would be likely to succeed in effecting any measure of concerted action and co-opeiation. (v) British Forces at Aden .— (a) One Day Bomber Squadron is available for air operations. (b) No ground forces can be spared from the Aden Garrison, with the exception of one or two British officers to undertake the organiza tion of the tribal forces. Approximately 70 men previously dis charged from the 1st Yemen Infantry or discharged or on leave from the Aden Protectorate Levies and Aden Armed and Unarmed Police could, however, be collected in the tribal area concerned, and would! form a nucleus of organized and disciplined troops under a British officer. The Residency Office could supply two Maxim guns for use by this small force. The presence of automatic weapons with the attackers would have a considerable moral effect on the Zeidis, and also enhance the morale of the ’Audhali tribes men themselves. S. Topography .— (i) Approaches to Adh Dhahir Plateau .—The only method of approach to Adh Dhahir Plateau from the south is up the face of the steep escarpment known as A1 Kor, which rises to an average height of 3,500 feet above ■ the plain about Lodar. There are four regular “ passes ” which are used by caravan traffic, and a number of rough and difficult tracks. A determined resistance, combined with sound tactical dispositions and a firm control of the defence, would render the capture of the crest a formidable task. This, however, is not likely to be experienced to a very high degree. The broken and rocky nature of the hillside favours the normal tribal method of attack, and, given a measure of surprise, an attack should stand a reasonable chance of success. It would, how ever, be difficult to retain the crest in the face of a strong counter-attack. There are no permanent defences on the crest with the exception of a small fort at Husnal Alam, and the fact that -the defenders would not operate as formed bodies of troops but be scattered among the rocks and boulders would result iti there being few effective targets for close co-operation aircraft during the attack. (ii) Adh Dhahir Plateau. —The occupied territory on the plateau comprises an area of approximately 25 miles by fi miles. It contains numerous small villages and groups of dwellings, but few towns or buildings of anv size. The country is rocky and broken, and well suited to guerilla tactics. There are no effective targets for air attack, and it would be almost impossible to distinguish between friend and foe from the air during a period of fighting on the ground. The consolidation of the area, once captured, in the face of renewed Zeidi attacks would require careful organization and an adequate tribal garrison. Except for the moial effect of their appearance, aircraft could afford little direct assistance in holding the ground gained. 9. Com m unic a tions .—A Roval Air Force Pack Wireless Telegraphy set is already installed at Lodar, and would provide adequate communication between Aden and any officer sent up to organize the tribal forces for the attack. 10. Attitude of the Imam of the Yemen .—In the course of the negotiations for a treaty with His Majesty’s Government which have been proceeding for some time, but which show no signs of immediate conclusion, the Imam stated that he would be prepared to evacuate the ’Audhah territory in Adh Dhahir as a necessary pieliminary to signature if agreement on other matters could be reached. This indicates that he has no strong reasons or desire for holding on to this area at all costs, and that if force is brought to bear on him he will probably withdraw his forces, butmi definite breakdown of the negotiations may harden his attitude in this respect. The Imam is known to fear the effects of air action, and to have a vivid recollection of the results.. . , i • tVia immediate withdrawal of his forces nf previous air operations ^ams i - threat of bombing directed against from the A1 ’Am area in ItMl consequent u objectives in Zeidi territory tends to.confirm tins view. Courses of Action open to the Imam. u. On receipt of an ultimatum from His Majesty’s Government there are three , courses which might be adopted by the Imam : hi forces from Adh Dhahir (i) He might accept the ultimatum, and withdraw ms roices (ii) n“ht accept the ultimatum, but profess to be unable to impose his ( } will on his local commanders in the occupied area In either case he will tend to vacillate and procrastinate and will try his face. refuse to comply with the ultimatum. Courses of Action open to Ourselves. 1.2. If offensive action is found to be necessary, there are two possible courses open t0 n;ze a tribal attack&gt; controlled by British officers, on the Zeidi oarrison of Adh Dhahir Plateau, supported by close air co-opeiation over A1 Eor and by the bombing of Al Beidha^ concentrated bomb. (il) ^^' 1 —^ dropped) of important military centres in Zeidi territory. At the same time holding the tubal forces in readiness to reoccupy Adh Dhahir Plateau as soon as any with- 13 AUhough b bombing is regarded with suspicion by delegates to Geneva it is considered that a tribal attack entirely unsupported by air action is doomedto ai Tnd should not be attempted. Any such failure would be at once attributed by the &gt; a nrlliali to lack of support bv His Majesty’s Government, vlnch v oulc ba reaching and adverse results throughout the Aden Protectorate, and would encourage the Imam to attempt further encroachments. . r nT1PA phncccs 14. While the moral effect of co-operation by aircraft won d enhance the chances of success in the course of action described m paragraph 1- (i) ^ m : 11 g u of suitable air objectives, and the comparative ineffimbveness of bm^mg smaff and scattered targets, would render such co-operation of little piaitic.i v. &lt; a waste of air effort. Moreover, the presence of arse numbers of Audi ah fob • throughout the whole of Adh Dhahir area, and the impossibility of protecting either their lives or their property from the effects of air attacks on the Zeuhs m tie make such attacks inadvisable. A further consideration is that this course confines air action to attacks on the local Zeidi forces in the occupied area. In such cimm stances the Imam might well remain indifferent to their immediate fate, and mere, await an opportunity to reoccupy the area as soon as the vigour of the tribal advance had been spent and the maioritv of the attackers had returned to their homes at ^ foot of Al Kor. This possibility would greatly increase the difficulty oi holding tr ground gained. Selection of the Best Course 15. The course of action described in paragraph_ 12 (ii), viz., to carry out intensive bombing of important military centres in Zeidi territory, while organizing the tribal forces for an advance as soon as the bombing has had effect is thereto! selected and recommended as the one most likely to achieve the desired en . operation would bring pressure to bear on the Imam himself, and would be i - &gt; to induce him to order the withdrawal of his forces from Adh Dhahir, thus enahhng the reoccupation of the area to be carried out without serious fighting and rut i U minimum loss of life on both sides. _ ? , 16. Several objectives for bombing exist, hut the town of Rada provides most suitable target for the initial attacks for the following reasons : . . „ (i) It is the advanced base on the lines of communication for the Zeidi ioices in the Al Beidha and Adh Dhahir Area.(ii) It is the nearest point in Zeidi territory to A1 Beidha which is in tele graphic communication with Sana’a. (iii) It contains large military barracks situated in the centre of the town. (iv) It is an important trade centre, with routes leading to Mocha and Aden. (v) It is within effective air range of Aden and attacks on it would impress the Imam with the possibilities of bombing Sana’a itself. (vi) It contains no Europeans. Plan of Action. 17. Ground Organization .—When the date for the proposed operations is decided on, and the ultimatum to the Imam prepared for despatch, the following action will be taken :—■ (a) - The Air Staff Intelligence Officer from Headquarters, British Forces, will proceed to Lodar by air, accompanied by the Political Officer who will rally and organize the tribal forces. The Air Staff Intelligence Officer will keep Headquarters informed by wireless telegraphy of the situation and will take charge of all ground operations. (b) All ’Audhali or allied tribesmen previously discharged on completion of service from the 1st Yemen Infantry, the Aden Protectorate Levies and the Aden Armed and Unarmed Police and those still serving but on leave to their homes and who volunteer for such service, will be instructed to report at Lodar for service under a British officer. (c) An officer of the Aden Protectorate Levies who will be invited to volunteer, will proceed to Lodar by road, taking with him two Maxim guns supplied by the Aden Residency, and all ‘Audhali tribesmen who are serving in the levies who can be spared and volunteer for this service. On arrival at Lodar he will take command of the personnel mentioned at (b) above, and will assist the Air Staff Intelligence Officer in planning the leadership and tactical employment of the tribal forces generally with the advice of the Political Officer. (d) The Aden Residencv will despatch such quantities of rifles and ammunition as are available and can be spared and native rations of the customary nature to Lodar for distribution among the tribes under the supervision of the Air Staff Intelligence Officer with the advice of the Political Officer. (e) No. 8 (B) Squadron will arrange to equip Museimir Landing Ground with supplies of fuel and bombs and ammunition, for use as an advanced land ing ground for operations against Rada’. 18. Operations .—- . (i) If the Imam fails to comply with the ultimatum, operations will beam with the intensive bombing of Rada’ followed, if necessary^ by the bomb ing of Dhamar, which is the headquarters for the admmisti ative am military control of A1 Beidha and Adh Dhahir Area. The custommiy notices will of course be dropped before bombing begins. (ii) The decision as to the appropriate time for beginning the tribal advance on Adh Dhahir Plateau must be left until the situation develops, and the effects of the bombing become apparent. When this decision has been taken, aircraft will be diverted temporarily from the mam objee i\e directly to support the advance. Enclosure 3 in No. Proposed ’Audhali Operations, 1933.

Your Highness, I am directed by His Majesty’s Government to state that whereas Your Highness in and before the year 1925 usurped and occupied by force of arms, and still occupies the territories of the ’Audhali Sultan on Adh Dhahir : And whereas Your Highness at the said time or subsequently has taken and continues to hold subjects of the ’Audhali Sultan as hostages and prisoners to the number of 31, as described in the list attached hereto :And whereas Your Highness’s retention of the said territories and hostages, and the oppression which ’Audhali suBjects have thereby been forced to bear have caused increasing unrest on the frontier : And whereas the whole of the territories of the ’Audhali Sultan and all their dependencies are under British protection by virtue of an existing treaty with His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Government require :—* (i) The complete withdrawal of Your Highness’s forces from, and the complete relinquishment of Your Highness’s administrative control over all the ’Audhali villages and lands on Adh Dhahir. (ii) The release of all ’Audhali hostages and prisoners from durance in Your Highness’s territories. (hi) The absolute prevention of every kind of damage or detriment to any ’Audhali subjects, or buildings, lands, crops, or other properties, before, during or after the said withdrawal, relinquishment, and release. (iv) The complete execution of the said withdrawal and relinquishment and the release of the said hostages and prisoners within two weeks from the date of this notification, i.e., by noon on the (Arabic date). His Majesty’s Government direct me to inform Your Highness that if the four demands set out above are not fully complied with within the time allotted, the towns of Bada’, and Dhamar and any other places in the Yemen which it may be deemed necessary to attack, will be bombed from the air. Lastly. His Majesty’s Government direct me to assure Your Highness that in making these demands and giving these warnings they have no motive of hostility to Your Highness or to the interest of the Yemen, nor have they any desire to interfere in Your Highness’s government of your proper territories. Bu they are determined that the territories and subjects of the Chiefs with whom they are in treaty relations shall be inviolate and that the restoration of ’Audhali territories, hostages and prisoners from Your Highness’s hands shall be no longer postponed. I have the honour to convey to Your Highness the expression of mv sincere regard, and the earnest hope that by compliance with the demands of His Majesty’s Govern ment. Your Highness will prevent the damage and destruction in the Yemen that your rejection of them will render immediately inevitable. Acting Resident, &amp;c.

In connexion with my despatch No. 162 of the 12th July, 1933,* on the subject of treaty relations with the Imam, I have the honour to enclose herewith the translation of a letter dated 20th June, 1933, that I have received from the Imam in regard to the proposed eventual appointment of British Consular or Political Officers to Sana’a. 2.

After Compliments. We beg to inform Your Excellency that it was declared in the previous draft Treaty which was to have been concluded and which was then urged and submitted^ by us, that a separate agreement should be concluded at a convenient time for the appoint ment of Consular officials by both parties in accordance with established custom. It was also declared that there should be a special article providing for a future_ accord between the two Governments regarding Political Officers. Actually, the appointment and exchange of Political Officers will be arranged after official relations have been established by the conclusion of the Treaty between the two Governments. The exchange of such political officers at that time would be a matter of course. We have agreed that there was no necessity for an additional clause in that_ respect, and found that your communication was in fact agreeable and conformable with the very matter. But our Government, as Your Excellency is already aware, is continuing to make its utmost endeavours to complete its internal organizations one aftei the other, as oppoi tunity offers. It is not possible, therefore, for our Government at present to provide all the material requirements necessary for the proper entertainment of Political Officers and for their accommodation. We have for this reason been compelled to postpone the exchange of Political officers with certain of the Powers with whom we have already concluded treaties, until some more favourable time. After the signing of the blessed Treatv with His Majesty’s Government now, by the Grace of God, if we were to accept Political officers appointed by His Majesty’s Government, the other Powers who are m treaty relations with us would naturally ask for the acceptance of their Political officers also In these circumstances we consider it reasonable to postpone the exhange ol Diplomatic and Political officers to some more favourable time, on account M the impossibility of providing for such officers, having regard to the reasons explained above. We deem it necessary to delay their coming to some convenient time, but we do not however, conceive the existence of an objection, should His Majesty s Govern ment find it necessary to appoint and depute a temporary delegate to us at any time to discuss anv affairs or business with us : we similarly on our part m the case ol emersencv. In view of all this, our Government, after the signing of the Treaty by the Grace of God, will within a short time do their best to complete the organization of the Department of Internal Affairs; and thereafter we shall be ready to receive Diplomatic and Political Officers. This matter needs no further explanation and paving of the way. In conclusion we beg to tender our best respects.

Lord LAMINGTON rose to ask whether troops of the Imam of the Yemen occupy a portion of the territory of the Audali and whether the Imam has imprisoned some of the tribesmen . whether the Audali are within the Aden Protectorate and are entitled to our pro tection ; whether the Imam has any com plaint against the tribe ; what action His Majesty’s Government propose to take ; and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Motion I have on the Paper refers to the Aden Protec torate, the Northern boundary of which was formed in 1904. At that time, of course, Turkey was the suzerain Power in South-West Arabia, and the boundary was arranged with the Turks. When the Turks came down and almost captured Aden towards the end of the Great War, they subsequently surrendered ; but other tribes followed—the tribes of the Imam of the Yemen. The Imam was an inde pendent sovereign, but of course was under the suzerainty of Turkey, and has always been a troublesome subject. When he came down, following on the LORDS] evacuation of the Protectorate by the Turkish troops, he garrisoned the State of Audali and other States, and it ^ only in 1928 that they were able to get him to evacuate. He has historical claj^ to the whole of the Protectorate of Aden including the Port of Aden itself. 1 In 1928 w r e took severe measures got him out of the Protectorate, but few years previously, in 1924, he occa- pied the territory of the tribe of Audali with which my Moti^deal lying much further away from Aden to the north-east. This tribe’s territon may be divided into two portions, tt[ northern and the southern, jg northern is situated on top of a _ plateau, 5,000 feet up, and is the fertile portion of the tribe’s territory. ^ southern portion is rather arid and prac tically non-productive. In 1924, as I said, the Imam’s troops came down seized the whole of the northern half, in 1925 they seized the southern also. We, in co-operation with tribes people themselves, drove the troops the Imam out of the State, but as si as our Air Force withdrew the Imam sent back his troops, and he has since that date occupied the northern half the Audali tribe’s territory, that is, fertile portion. His troops harassed and oppressed the people, and levied very heavy taxation on them. At tie same time he seized several prisoners of the tribe, and as far as I know he sti! holds about twenty of them. For some extraordinary reason these prisoners are called hostages. There is no ques tion of their being hostages, though in every Government Paper they are termed that. A hostage is someone who sin renders as a pledge for certain acts, These are simply prisoners taken in w and held by the Imam, and very muck maltreated. Not unnaturally, their ruler complains very bitterly, and has complained after year, as I understand, at our neglect to give him proper protection and rescue him from the toils of the Imam. We have done nothing as far as I know to help him to get his territory back, and the result is that recently heard that he now wants to fight the Imam himself.

In any case, I believe we gave more or less of an undertaking to the then Sultan because he was wobbling in his allegiance and undecided whether he should join with the Imam or side with us. By our assuring him that everything would come right in the end he was persuaded to remain faithful to the Protectorate. But year by year the old condition of affairs goes on. I recently paid a visit to the country of the Sultan and he then said to me : “It is all right giving promises, but for seven years 1 believed you were going to take action and you have done nothing.” As I have previously pointed out, there would be rather serious consequences if the Sultan of the Audali were defeated and the Imam’s troops came down into the whole of his estate because in that case the Imam’s territory would extend practically to the coast, and there would be a corridor cutting Aden in two and this corridor would be of a more grievous kind than the one in Poland. What would be the result of this 1 First of all, you have in the Aden Protectorate levy a .small but very efficient ahd hardy body of 200 men. These are largely recruited from the Audali country and also from the States further east. With this corridor which I have just described you might lose them, which would mean you would lose your best recruiting area for your levy. A man would hardly join the Aden Protectorate when he is a subject of the Imam. It would obviously not be very convenient for the tribes further to the east to have to cross the Yemen terri tory in order to get to the headquaiteis of the Protectorate levy. There is another point in connection with this corridor. The corridor would cut off all the tribes to the east, and also the whole of the Hadramaut. That is the coast line fronting the Indian Ocean for which we are responsible. All com munication by land would be at an end between Aden and all these territories lying to the east. That would not be very exalting to our prestige, and the probable result would be that other tribes nearer to Aden would also desert the Protec torate and put themselves under the power or under the protection of the Imam of the Yemen as the one strong ma-Ti there. That will be almost the cer-407 The Imam of [ LORDS ] tain result of our present weakness. I think every competent person would isa;y that under such circumstances it would be necessary then to increase the Aden garrison. The Aden garrison has been tremendously reduced during the last few years—I do not say over-reduced, btili it has been reduced very largely, and now consists of 200 gunners, a squadron of the Air Force and the 200 men of the Aden Protectorate levy. If those territories come under the authority and control of the Imam of the Yemen undoubtedly the Aden garrison will be insufficient. Our prestige, has been so weakened of late that these are very possible conse quences. I have no hostile feeling my self towards the Imam. On the many occasions on which I have wearied Y ? 111 Lordships’ House in reference to the Aden Protectorate, I have always been rather his upholder, and have said that I thought he had not been well handled; but since my visit to Aden I have realised what a monstrous act of aggression it has been on his part to seize this territory and to remain there without protest from us, or at any rate without any direct action fi om us. Every year the position worsens and becomes more difficult to deal with. The treaty which has been the general theme of any remarks I have made in the past in connection with the Aden Protectorate —the treaty between ourselves and the Imam—has not been advanced, I am sure, by our reluctance to take strong measures and tell the Imam that unless he evacuates this territory and releases these prisoners we will not entertain any idea of a treaty with him. Had we taken that line I think we should have been able to negotiate a proper treaty with him, but with this pitiful example of weakness on our part it is not unnatural that he should treat us with contempt. He has done nothing to release these un fortunate prisoners or to withdraw his troops from the land to which he has no right whatever. I hope to hear from the noble Earl who is to reply that action will be taken by His Majesty’s Govern ment. In the meanwhile I beg to move for Papers. the Yemen the noble Lord, Lord Lamington, has i e . ferred. I do not think it is necessary for me to go into that history. I Woulc [ rather confine myself to the specific quej. tions which the noble Lord has raised on the Motion that he has put down upon the Paper. At the same time I think, in connection with these specific areas, it j s necessary to recount some of the past history of the case. As the noble Lord told your Lordships the Imam is the head of the Zaidi sect o Islam and now rules over a large territon- in South-West Arabia. The Yemen ^ under the Turks from 1871 to 1918. Between 1903 and 1905 the boundary was delineated between the Aden Protectorate and the Turkish territory in a series of agreements, and in 1914 these agreements were combined in one single convention, In 1918, as the noble Lord has told yon at the end of the War, the Turks si occupied a part of the Aden Protectorate. They were never fifljtually ejected hy force of arms but after the Armistice they were eventually negotiated out of it, When that took place the Imam took over control, or rather took the place of the Turks in the Yemen, and I think it may be truthfully said that he has consistently refused to recognise the Anglo-Turkish boundary which had previously been delineated. ! ivas Chid) chose. re# 1 . that irthe the do* IfSiW, *' '** »&gt; tb “ *!* f I*®*®” 5 'Vs®* 1 JisWl The PARLIAMENTARY UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (The Earl of Plymouth) My Lords, there is a great deal of his tory, both ancient and recent, in connec tion with this part of Arabia to which Lord Lamington. To come to the specific events to which the noble Lord has referred, it was in 1924 that the Zaidi troops occupied the upper country of the Audali tribe. This tribe—to answer the noble Lord’s specific question—is under British protec tion by virtue of a Treaty signed in 1914. In 1925 the Imam invaded the lower Audali country. The Imam’s troops were at once dislodged from the lower portion of the Audali country by air action, but eff orts to reach the same success in the upper portion of the territory failed, think the failure was very largely due to the fact that the Audalis themselves failed to co-operate properly with the Air Force. Then, in 1926, hostilities were suspended during a Mission of Sir Gilbert Clayton to Sana’a but the object: of that Mission eventually broke down on the question of the evacuation of occupied Protectorate territory by the Imam. About that time the Audali Chief f it expedient to come to terms with the Zaidis. This action was, however, re pudiated by the inhabitants of the southern portion of the territory.

Let me now oome to atlot I ler P art of the War, of the Aia}| never entnallv ■ather took !e Yemen, i :he noble Lord’s Question, with regard to he Protectorate tribesmen who are still prisoners of the Imam. It is perfectly rue that he still has a number of tribes- ailn nen as prisoners. Originally, I believe, ne - :fc hhere were something like forty. One is -’eported to have died, two have escaped, eight have been released on the repre sentation of the Resident at Aden, and said that hen [ think that some time in 1931 one other M'Ogmse the W as a member of the Audali hich had R e g e nt’s own family, was also released Dn the intercession of the Political i the specie e-:P fficer at Aden - The release of the re ' 3 rd has reie- raining prisoners has also been made an e' Zaidi ©?•' absolute condition of the signing of a : ; Treaty and I understand from Colonel n . wer Reilly, who is Resident at Aden, that he Imam has expressed his willingness hil^aT '' 0 acce Pt doth these conditions.

He made an excuse of ytonto' rontier incidents—that trouble had been sion evffi nude by the Audali tribesmen—but I o. of th e Td '- hink that can only be considered an ;e temc excuse, and that in fact there was no : time tie A , r ovocation whatsoever oh the part of it to e - he Audalis. action fit ^ At the same time, it has to be admitted bv the hat the present divided control does ortionof^ naturally lead to difficulties and to trouble. The noble Lord said that he had recently heard that the Audali Sultan had stated that unless something was done he would himself go to war with the troops of the Imam. I can only say that we have no information on that point. This is the first time that I have heard such a suggestion made. T want to impress upon your Lordships that the recovery of Audali territory is definitely linked up with treaty negotia tions. Your Lordships may very rightly ask what is the position with regard to those treaty negotiations and how long are they likely to last. I can assure your Lordships that these negotiations have reached an advanced stage. There may be certain obstacles to the conclusion of a treaty and there have been difficulties in regard to a certain article of the draft treaty. It is really not necessary to go into details—I am sure your Lordships would not desire me to do so—but I would like to inform the House that cer tain concessions in regard to that par ticular article have been offered to the Imam in order to try to facilitate a settlement. Personally I have no doubt, and I think the noble Lord will agree with me on this point, that much of the difficulty in connection with this treaty arises owing to the desire of the Imam to secure recognition in that treaty, in some form or another, of his claim to at least a certain portion of the Aden Protectorate which he looks upon as his ancestral domain. I have made inquiries into past history and I am assured that the ancestors of the Imam only occupied this territory for a very short period in the eighteenth century. The territory is now inhabited by a number of Shafia tribes who are, and have been for many years, in treaty relations with the United Kingdom. I feel sure, therefore, that your Lordships will agree that in these circumstances it is inconceivable to admiu any claim on the part of the Imam to jurisdiction over these people. There is another difficulty in connec tion with the conclusion of this treaty which arises over certain islands in the Southern Red Sea. The difficulty about these islands is that by the Treaty of Lausanne the future of these islands is left to be settled by the parties con cerned. Therefore it is quite clear that411 The Imam of they are not ours to give away to the Imam if we wished to do so. The position has been explained, I think, to the Imam time after time in order to meet him as far as posisble, and the Resident has informed him that if a treaty were con cluded His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to bear in mind any views which the Imam wished to put forward on the future status, of these islands in the event of that matter coming up for reconsideration. The Imam has now been informed that these concessions do con stitute the last word of His Majesty’s Government, and up till now no reply has been received. In summary the position is this: We have laid down three pre-conditions to the signing of the treaty. The first is the evacuation of all Protectorate terri tory ; the second is the release of all Protectorate tribesmen ; and the third is the removal of restrictions on trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protec torate. I understand that the Imam has agreed to the first two conditions, but that up till now no satisfactory answer has been received with regard to the last, and recently the Resident has reminded the Imam of that particular question. It is therefore quite clear that this question —I mean the recovery of Audali territory —has been definitely linked up with settlement by negotiation through the conclusion of a treaty. I naturally sincerely hope that these negotiations will reach a successful conclusion, but I must say that if they fail, or if we do I not receive a satisfactory reply within a reasonable period, clearly the whole posi tion will have to be reconsidered afresh. I dare say the noble Lord would like me to say what we would do in those circum- istances, but I think the House will see that I am not in a position to say any thing definite on that point. All I can say is that if the conclusion of these negotiations is delayed beyond a reason able time the whole matter will have to be reconsidered afresh. I hope the noble Lord will be satisfied with the informa tion I have been able to give him. Lord LAMINGTON: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for his answer, which really hinges upon what is a reason able time. The main part of his answer referring to the negotiations is almost the same as I have heard for the last three or four years ; in fact, it seems word for The Earl of Plymouth. the Yemen 412 word the same about the hope that thing is going to be accomplished in the references to the attitude of h. Imam, his pretensions to the whole Uz Protectorate, hereditary rights and so on I therefore say that that part of th answer is unsatisfactory. But the nobl Earl spoke definitely of a reasonable % and I trust that the Colonial Office wj]i take notice of that, or otherwise I shall have to press the matter again,^ Ti, e Government must take some aT'yn B redeem the position of these unfortunate people and also to redeem our credit ajj honour in the Aden Protectorate. 14 not know whether the noble Earl will 1 lay Papers. I cannot see any objection I to that course. The subject is a plain I one, there is no possibility of indiscretion and I think it is highly desirable that the country should know definitely what has been taking place between ourselves anil the Imam. If the noble Earl could give an undertaking to furnish Papers I wi| withdraw my Motion, but if not I should like to divide the House. The Earl of PLYMOUTH: My Lords, 1 did not know that the noble Lord had made a specific point of laying Papers, I have not really had time to go into that matter properly, and it is therefore impossible for me to give an undertaking here and now that Papers should belaid But I will inquire whether there is m objection to laying them. Lord LAMINGTON : My Lords, I hope the noble Earl will do that and press it. There cannot be any objection and it is highly desirable that the public should he aware of what has taken place. There could not be difficulties with foreign Powers, or anything of that sort, and therefore I think the Colonial Office could produce the Papers. If the noble Eari will give an undertaking to place the matter strongly before the Colonial Office I will withdraw. The Earl of PLYMOUTH: My Lords, I will make inquiries to see if what the noble Lord suggests is possible, but I cannot give any undertaking. Lord LAMINGTON: I should have thought the noble Earl might make it possible. I ask leave to withdraw. Motion for Papers, by leave, withdrawn.

[Answered by No. .] (Secret.) Sir, Downing Street, 14th April, 1932. 'A I have the honour to refer to your Secret despatch No. 208 of the 21st October last, 4 and my telegram No. 6 of the 16th of March,! on the subject of the draft Treaty with the Imam, and to enclose a counter draft of the proposed Treaty which has been prepared after consultation with the various Government Departments concerned. 2. I have the following observations to make :— The Preamble has been re-worded in the usual form. With regard to Article I, you will observe that the reference to the “ Govern ments ” ha.s been omitted, as it is inappropriate to make both them and the Heads of the States undertake the same obligation. The words c ‘ of whatsoever kind ” have been substituted for the concluding words of the Imam’s draft article which are con tradictory, since it is impossible to have “ internal international affairs^’ If, however, the Imam sets store by them, the words c&lt; internal or external ” could be added as shown in the draft. 3. Article II has been redrafted in a simplified form and the reference to Governments ” again omitted for the same reason as in Article I. 4. With regard to Article III, His Majesty’s Government consider it preferable to substitute the phrase “ Southern frontier of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen ” in lieu of the expression cc Southern frontier of the Yemen,” thus making it clear that the reference is to the territory of the King of the Yemen, and not to the vague term “ Yemen ” which has been used to describe the entire south west portion of the Arabia. 5. As regards the “ Islands of the Yemen,” His Majesty’s Government agree with the views expressed by you in paragraph 2 (3) of your despatch under reference. It seems probable, as you suggest,- that this term is intended to cover Kamaran, Perirn, the Hanish, and Jebel Zukur group, and possibly the Farsan Islands. With the exception of the latter, all these Islands, which had formerly been Turkish (with the exception of Perim), fall to be dealt with under Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, so that His Majesty’s Government is not free to enter into any bi-lateral engagements with the Imam in relation to them, and the Farsan Islands have now been incorporated in the territories of King Ibn Sand. As regards the £C original rights ” of the Imam, whilst His Majesty’s Government could not accept any phrase which might imply an admission that the Imam possessed any “ rights ” in the Protectorate, they considered it desirable to make it clear that the proposed treaty was without prejudice to the rights and claims of His Majesty s Government, more especially as regards treaty relations with frontier tribes, &amp;c. The wording now inserted covers, therefore, the “ rights claimed ” by either High Contracting party and has the further advantage of suggesting that the treaty is being concluded in conditions of complete reciprocity- 6. You will note that the paragraph relating to the status quo has been reworded with a view to clearer definition, and the alternatives “ signature or coming into force ” have been substituted for the imprecise word c£ conclusion. It is suggested that, as the Imam must evacuate the parts of the Protectorate which he occupies before the Treaty is signed, the word ££ signature ” would perhaps be preferable. 7. In Article IV the reference to the establishment of political and consular relations has been omitted. His Majesty’s Government do not enter into agreements for the establishment of consular arrangements, but there is no objection to the Imam being informed, if he presses the point, that this would not prevent arrangements foi the exchange of consular representatives being made later, as and when necessary. As regards political relations, His Majesty’s Government consider that every effoit should be made to secure the formal agreement of the Imam to the reception at Sana a of a permanent representative of the Resident at Aden, and it could be agreed, if the Imam so desired, to his having, in exchange, a permanent representative at Aden. f the Imam agrees, his agreement should, without further reference to me, be embodied not in the Treaty itself, but in an exchange of notes. If he does not agiee to any permanent British representative at Sana’a, or will only agree to a formal exchange or diplomatic representatives to reside in Sana’a and London, this question should be referred to me. * No. C. 89280/31 [No. 26]. t C. 97857/32 [No. 50] : not printed. Aden.— Gp. 6. 174/2792. 24. 24. 2/33. (14971) M. &amp; S.9 8 I am of the opinion that, a$ you and your staff are best fitted, both from the standpoint of local knowledge and knowledge of Arabic, to deal with the Imam, the staffing of the post at Sana’a, which, it is admitted, will be a very isolated and trying one. could be most easily arranged by detaching an officer of suitable rank from your staff This officer might be relieved as often as was necessary by another member of your staff, and I should be glad to have your views as to whether it is necessary to increase your staff by one officer for this purpose, in which case it will be nem ary for me to consult the Secretary of State for India^ who may wish to refer the question to the Government of India. I should also on this point be glad to receive your views as to the emoluments to be attached to this post. You will see that, in the counter draft, it is^ suggested that Article IV, as now drafted, is unnecessary m view of Article ^ , but if the Imam attaches importance to it, no objection need be raised to its inclusion. 9. Article V has been redrafted to embody the normal practice which at present obtains in such matters. As regards paragraph (1)1 have to point out that Article 15 in the original draft Treaty prepared in 1924 contained a provision for securing national treatment in matters concerning the administration of justice. I should be glad to receive your views as to whether you consider that, in practice, most-favoured-nation treatment is the best that can be secured, and whether, having regard to the presumably primitive nature of the administration of justice by the Imam in respect of his own subjects, there would in fact be any practical advantage in securing national treatment. 10. With regard to paragraph (2) it is the practice to include in present-day treaties national and most-favoured-nation treatment for vessels, their cargoes, and their passengers, probably in this instance, national treatment is of little importance, but here again, I should be glad to receive your views as to whether you consider most-favoured-nation treatment is the best that can be secured. On both these points I am prepared to be guided by your advice, and if you consider Article V of the counter draft as it stands secures the best treatment in practice, the reopening of negotiations need not be delayed thereby. 11. In paragraph (3) you will observe that the words “ territories,” “ subjects,” and “ vessels ” have been defined. If necessary it can be explained to the Imam that these definitions are necessitated by^the constitutional position of the different parts of the British Empire. 12. As regards Article VII, His Majesty’s Government hold the view that the negotiator should hold out for English and Arabic texts of equal validity if it cannot be secured that the English text should prevail, and that he should not on any account give way on this while any other points connected with the proposed Treaty remain unsettled, as it would create an embarrassing precedent. If, however, the Imam remains adamant on the point, where all else is agreed, and the language question alone, therefore, prevents the conclusion of a satisfactory treaty, His Majesty’s Government consider that the negotiator might, in the last resort, agree to an Arabic text only, while naturally taking every precaution to ensure that it accurately repre sents the English text, which will be required for presentation to Parliament. 13. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government consider it most desirable that you should conduct the negotiations in person. Possibly the Imam would not ask for the communication of C£ full powers ” until the Treaty, if it eventuates, is about to be signed.

Done at (Sana’a) in English and Arabic, both texts having equal force, this-.. day ofTHE SUB-COMMITTEE had Before them the following papers dealing with the proposed Treaty with the Imam of the Yemen - Despatch dated 14.1.33 from the Resident at Aden. (Paper No. M.E.(C) 8S). Despatch dated 15 Q 2=33, and enclosure, from the Resident at Aden. THE CHAIRMAN said that there were two problems for discussion - (a) The substance of Article III of the proposed Treaty; and (b) The instructions to be given to the Resident at Aden as regards the procedure to be followed and subsequent action. MR. COWELL said that he assumed that the Sub-Committee would adhere to the view that there were no such advantages to be gained from the conclusion of a Treaty as would justify our making any material concessions to the Imam. He considered that in the first place it was necessary to support the Resident in his refusal to proceed to Sanaa until the Imam had removed the existing trade restrictions. The time had now come, in his opinion, to intimate to the Imam that His Majesty’s Government cannot continue indefinitely to haggle over preliminary negotiations. As regards the proposed re-draft of Article III, he had no objection to the substitution of the words ^outncrn Yemen territories” for ”southern irentier of the territories of His Majesty The King of the Yemen” seeing that the Imam’s wording apparently agreed without reserveto the maintenance of the existing position sin e di e. The material objection to the proposed re-wording of Article III was that it contained no undertaking to respect the existing frontier., He pointed out that the main advantage to he obtained from the conclusion of a Treaty would lie in the provision of facilities for the prompt settlement of frontier incidents by responsible persons representing the Resident and the Imamo He thought ? however v that there would be no harm in accepting this wording*subject to the addition of some reciprocal clause binding both parties to respect the existing boundaries. He said that the Colonial Office maintained their objection to dealing with the somewhat nebulous question of the Red Sea Islands in the proposed Treaty He, however, thought that a formula, such as that proposed by the Resident at Aden in paragraph 6 of his letter of the 14-th January, might prove the solution* MR. LAITHWAITE s sid the India Office were not very directly concerned and would, be prepared to agree to any solution which commended itself to the Foreign Office and Colonial Office. They fully subscribed to the views expressed by Mr. Cowell as regards the necessity for raising trade restrictions and for indicating to the Imam that we cannot continue indefinitely to haggle over preliminary negotiations* As regards the proposed redraft of Article IIIthey agreed, however, with the Resident that the wording of the existing British draft, in so far as it referred to the southern boundary of the Yemen was preferable to that suggested by the Imam and should be retained* As regards the final sentence of Article III they were disposed to agree with the Colonial Office views.The guestion of the islands was one of great difficultyo So far as the India Office were concerned they remained of their previous view that it was unde sir ah le in any way to covin it ourselves on we had some indication that while the islands in which the Imam was interested did not include Perim they apart from those incumbent on us in the Treaty of Lausanne; and the position of the Parsan Islands was one of quite peculiar difficulty, since, apart from the fact that they might he regarded as remaining for disposal under the Lausanne Treaty, they did de facto form part of the territories of the Kingdom of Asir, which had now heen overrun by Ibn Saud, hut Ibn Saud f s good title to which had not yet formally heen recognised hy us^ On the general question of tactics, the balance of advantage seemed definitely to rest with action on the lines suggested in the last paragraph of the Resident's despatch^ We had nothing to lose hy delay* On the other hand, it became increasingly clear as time went on that delay was not in the interest of the Imam and that he had good reasons of his own for desiring to conclude a settlement with His Majesty's Government in the near future„ Subject to the views of the Foreign Office he was, therefore, inclined to think that we should confine possible concessions to the Imam to the modification of the last sentence of Article III, informing him at the same time that, failing his acceptance of our other desiderata, the negotiations must he regarded as at an end^ Farsan Islands c It was clearly quite impossible for us to enter into any commitment in respect of any of these islands 0 The Italians were known to he interested in certain of the Kanish group; we had international obligations in respect of Kamaran, quite-4_ -1 kR. HENDEL, m reply to a question whether the Imam could he regarded as having a valid claim to the islands as successor to the Ottoman Empire or whether he could he re garded as having been the real sovereign of the islands, irrespective of the claims of the Ottoman Empire over his territory, pointed out that the status of the Imam in relation to the Ottoman Empire, though not immediately relevant to the present issue, was a matter of some impor tance. our main claim to the present frontier between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate rested on our pre-war frontier agreement with the Ottoman Government. If anything were now to be said or done which implied a doubt as to whether the Yemen had been legally part of the Ottoman Empire before the war, the effect would be to cast a doubt on the validity of the arrangements we had made with the Ottoman Government regarding the frontier of the Protectorate, and thus to play into the Imam's hands. Moreover any doubt cast on the validity of these Anglo-Turkish arrangements might equally affect other frontiers in Southern Arabia such as that between Ifejd and Qatar etc. If, however, the Yemen and any islands pertaining to it were regarded as being legally a part of the pre-war Ottoman Empire (which was of course the case), the islands pertaining to the Yemen were fully covered by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne and their disposal was therefore a matter for international agree ment. Having dealt with this subsidiary question, Mr. Rendel then proceeded to deal with the question of the proposed amend ments to Article III of the draft treaty. While he did notwish to raise undue difficulties, his personal view was that the first amendment proposed hy the Imam, i.e, the substitution of the words ’'Southern Yemen territories” for the words ’’Southern frontier of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen”, was open to grave objections. The latter phrase has been evolved as a result of much laborious consideration, in order to avoid any implication that the term ’’Yemen” could be regarded as covering the Aden Protectorate^ The Imam had, throughout these discussions been concerned to try to secure a wording which might enable him to claim that the Protectorate and even the settlement of Aden were part of his ancestral domaines. The wording proposed by His Majesty’s Government made it clear that the Yemen was a territory lying to the north of the Protectorate and possessing a frontier dividing it from the Protectorate. The Imam’s wording would go much further towards keeping the Imam’s claims alive than the proviso in the draft put forward by His Majesty’s Government that both parties reserved ’’the rights claimed by them”. Moreover it would affect all subsequent references to ’’the Yemen” in the Treaty by making it possible to give that term a far more extended meaning and would therefore mean that our recognition of the Imam as King of the Yemen might be taken as going a good deal further than we intended it to. He felt strongly therefore that on this point no concession to the Imam should be made and that we should stick to the statement which had already been made to the Imam that our wording on this point could not be modified. As regards the second amendment proposed, i 0 e. that the undertaking to refrain from aggression should be mutual-6- lie could not for the moment recollect the precise reason why His Majesty's Government had thought it 'best to propose that this undertaking should be unilateral. Unless, however, there had keen some very strong reason for this, he thought there could he no objection to making the undertaking mutual. He believed that the Air Ministry had at one tine been anxious to retain complete freedom to take action against the Imam’s territory in case of need. To the best of his re col-lection, however, it had already been agreed that such action could only be taken in the event of the Imam himself having so grossly violated the new treaty as to release us from our obligations under it. Unless, therefore, other Departments saw serious objection, he did not think the Foreign Office would object to making the non-aggression undertaking binding on both parties. &gt; As regards the islands, he felt that the position was still as described by the Foreign Office when the matter was last discussed (see M.E, (0) 85), i.e. that it would in fact be impossible to give the Imam any real satisfac tion over these islands, and that anything we said to him on the subject must therefore be either unnecessary or misleading. If it was merely a question of hearing the Imam’s views, it would obviously be open to the Imam to express any views he liked to us on any subject, after the treaty had been concluded, when we should have a resident Representative in the Yemen with whom he would be in constant communication. Moreover, there was a further objection to referring in any communication to the Imam to ’’the islands of the Yemen” since this was to a large extent begging the question of whether they had any connection with the Yemen or not. On the other hand, not washing to be purely destructive, it had occurred to him, as a purelypersonal suggestion, that something might be done to meet Colonel Reilly’s suggestion hy addressing a communication to the Imam which should refer not to the islands of the Yemen’S hut to ”those islands at the southern end of the Red Sea which are covered by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne.” This would automatically exclude Perim, and could be taken as excluding the Parsan Islands, which had now been generally recognised as being under the effective sovereignty of Ibn Saud, It would also leave the question open whether the Hanish Islands were or were not covered by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne - a question on which he believed the Italian Government held strong views. It would then be possible for the Resident at Aden to write to the Imam, saying that if and when the fate of the islands at the southern end of the Red Sea covered by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, should come up for discussion, His Majesty’s Govern ment would be prepared in such discussion to bear the Imam s views in mind. ME. LAJTH’t'AITE said that the formula seemed to ofier a very satisfactory method of disposing of this question if it was thought desirable to go any distance to meet the Imam in respect of it. On the general question the India Office would be guidea by the other Departments. But he was himself disposed to question whether it would not be better to make no advance towards the Imam at the moment. In this connection it snould not be overlooked that if it were necessary to register the pro posed treaty when concluded with the League of Nations the possible reaction of any undertaking of the nature suggested would have to be carefully considered, ME. BENDEL pointed out that an undertaking of this nature, if given, would be communicated to the Imam in a separate letter and would not form part of the treaty. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSR stated that the Air Ministry thought that any reference to the islands should be omitted.agreed as they were very anxious to avoid the question of the ownership of these islands “being raised. MR. REN DEL then took up the question of the tactics which possession suggested that the Imam was more eager for the conclusion of a treaty than were His Majesty’s Government, As far as His Majesty's Government were concerned, no great harm would be done by an indefinite continuance of the present situation. In these circumstances Mr. Rendel entire3.y agreed that the time had come v/hen we could take a firm line with the Imam, But it seemed to him that it would be far better to do this by sticking to our terms on the main issues and telling the Imam that he must take them or leave them, than by agreeing to further important modifications in those terms and then setting a time limit within which the Imam must accept them. What would happen when the time limit expired? Should we then withdraw our concessions and go back to stiffen terms? This would hardly be practicable. Indeed, the situation after the expiration of the time limit, however we might represent it, would in fact be much the same as it had been before, and the Imam would know this. It was not as though we were in a position to enforce sanctions against the Imam in the event of his non-acceptance o± our ultimatum. The ultimatum would in fact be an illusory one, while the fact that we had first offered further concessions and then tried to hasten the conclusion of a settlement by fixing a date, would give the Imam tne impression that we kqvq eager to reach a settlement as soon as possible. He felt, therefore, that the best course would be to state our final terms, first making such minor concessions as we suitaoly coulu to tell the Imam that he must take them or leave these terms; and,in the event of his attempting to argue further, merely to say that we could add nothing to what we have told him, and should be followed. All the information at present in our let the matter drop -8-GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE agreed&lt;» He thought that to indicate a time limit might lead the Imam to think we were anxious to conclude a Treaty. He considered that the Imam should now he told that this is our final offer which he could take or leave. He did not agree with the proposed phrase in Article III 1T southern Yemen territory’ 1 , which was vague. The Imam still occupies certain territory within the boundary of the Aden Protectorate. He thought that there should he no ambiguity as to the boundary which might give the Imam an excuse for remaining in possession. THE CHAIRMAN said that the general view of the meeting appeared to be that there would be no advantage in giving a time limit, but that the Resident should now send a final reply; that the trade restrictions must be removed before negotiations for a treaty could be proceeded with; that the original wording of Article III should he generally adhered to, except that undertaking to refrain from aggression should he made reciprocal and that if the Imam wished, the words from 'it heing understood' to 'in those regions' might he omitted; and that H.M. Government should refuse to deal with the islands in the treaty, hut could give an assurance through the Resident in the sense suggested hy the Foreign Office. CONCLUSION. THE SUB-COMMITTEE AGREED:- (1) That as regards the proposed re- wording of Article III of the Treaty the should instruct the Resident at Aden that they were prepared to accept the following re-wording:- 'The settlement of the question of the southern frontier of the territories of His Majesty The King of the Yemen is deferred, pending the conclusion, in whatever way he agreed on hy both High Contracting Parties in aUpirit of friendship and complete concord, free from any dispute or difference, of the negotiationsArtiich shall take place between them before the expiry of the period of the Trpp.sant Treaty.Pending the conclusion of the negotiations referred to in the preceding paragraph ? the High Contracting Parties agree to maintain the situation existing in regard to the frontier on the date of the signature of this Treaty, and both High Con tracting parties undertake that they will prevent, by all means at their disposal, any violation by their forces of the above-mentioned frontier, and any interference by their subjects or persons under their protection with the affairs of the subjects or persons under the protection of the other High Contracting Party. (2) As regards procedures- (a) That it would be preferable not to impose any specific time limit for the acceptance by the Imam of the terms put forward by His Majesty’s Government, since the situation after the expiration of such a time limit would be much the same as it was before, but instead to inform the Imam of our final terms, make it clear that His Majesty’s Government cannot go further towards meeting his views, and refrain from pursuing the correspondence if he should attempt to argue further. (b) That it should be made clear to the Imam that the existing trade restrictions between the Yemen and the Aden protectorate must be removed before there can be any question of continuing negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty. (c) That the Imam should be told that His Majesty s Government cannot agree to deal with the question of any islands in the proposed treaty, out tna they will be ready, if a treaty is concluded, and if and when the future of those islands at the southern end of the Red Sea which are covered by Article XVI of the Treaty of Lausanne comes up consideration, to bear in mind any views which the Imam may wish to put forward in regard to „hem. hitehall Gardens, S.W.l, 7th March, 1933. mmL ft* ^ Mr. Walton, Please see submission on P.Z. 1059/33 below. Colonel Hellly's letter of 15th February on P.Z. 1220 ana the further letter from the Imam now also attached go, I think, to strengthen the case for adopting the line suggested In the previous submission. It seems quite clear that the Imam Is not at this stage preparea to go any farther to meetus and the effect of the-last paragraph of his letter appears to be that he is not preparea to raise his blockade.'THIS DOCUMENT IS TKB PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC IvlAJSSTY^ aOVSRI^KNT), ’ E CJOLXi.

We recalled to our mind your good name, We beg to explain to Your Excellency that we have agreed to the change and curtailment of the third article which we consider to be the most important and most necessary article for us, in order to prove our earnest inclination merely to make it possible to come to an agreement with the Great British Government and in order that it may serve as a new proof of our good 'will. We hope that this true and sincere friendship on our part wull have your Governments consideration Inshalla. As to the mention of the Yemen Islands, we have made no condition, pressure or demand on that subject. We have only given a hint regarding any dealing with or adjustment of the said Islands that may be made, We have inserted a paragraph in order to preserve the status guo perpetually, ve submissively state that it was incumbent upon us not to make any change which would be prejudicial to our Government and Kingdom at either the present time or in the future. We have drawn up a. clause which aims at thisoftiect and no'tb.ing else, dolwi'tns'taiidirig 'ttiis we have made simple and short (or ahoreviated) clauses (or drafts) which may possibly he acceptsole and chosen, and so^ the refusal on the part of the Great British Government to the above endorsement was unexpected or not hoped lor as a sign, of the good will and friendliness entertained for our Kingdom. he thinh that the demand for further sacrifices over and above all that, is inconsistent with the desired object which is the conclusion of friendly relations between the two Kingdoms. As to the other special matters (to which you have referred and as we have already submitted and explained to you repeatedly, we Have no doubt that your Excellency is paying attention to them) we say that it is impossible before the conclusion of the friendly ties between the two Governments, to mate material or substantial arrangements for the. organisation and adjustment of such matters and for rendering good assistance in that respect. Such being the case, we repeat our request to you to use your earnest efforts to secure and establish ties of affection and friendship between the two Kingdoms. We beg to confirm our respects.

My dear Cowell, Thank you far your D.o. letter 97857/32 Fart II dated 21st January 1933 . I realise the d esirahility of discouraging the use by the Imam of non-official intermediaries such as Mr. Baile K , and my letter of 22nd October 1952 to the Imam was intended to do so. I remember very well the harm and delay that have been caused in the past by the intervention of unofficial volunteers, and I advised Mr. BaL ley, when he came to Aden, not to take up a r 6 le for which he himself realised that he is entirely unsuited. I am sending to the Colonial Office by this mail a copy of the Imam^ last letter to me, in which he declines to raise his embargo on land trade between his territory and the Aden Protectorate, and adheres to his claim to the Red Sea islands. I think it is time to put some pressure on him by letting him know that the negotiations cannot be permitted to drift indefinitely while he continues to occupy portions of the ,Aden Protectorate, to hold British protected persons as prisoners, to prohibit the legitimate trade of the Protectorate with the Yemen, and to persist in territorial claims which he has repeatedly been told cannot be recognised in the treaty. Too much patience is not a virtue in dealing with the Imam, and it would be well if he were made to understand that ours may soon be exhausted. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) B. ri. Reilly. .

The instructions sent to Colonel Reilly as the rresult of subsequent aiscussion in the official Middle East Sub*Committee are on P.Z.464/33. 2. A further letter has now been received from the Imam. He has suggested certain drafting alterations with a view to meeting our objections. Unfortunately, he remains rigid on the subject of the islands, while a further drafting alteration put forward by him is open to objection for the reasons given in paragraph 3 of Colonel Reilly’s despatch. Moreover, the explicit unaertaking a gainst aggression or interference in the Protectorate which we are anxious to secure from the Imam has disappeared. 3. Colonel Reilly, in the light of the correspondence and particularly of the Imam’s maintenance of his claim to the islands (which appear definitely (paragraph 6) to include the Farsan group at Kamaran and the Ha/nish and other smaller islands in the Red Sea, about which we are not in a position to make any concession) is not disposed to recommend that he should be authorised to proceed to Sana, and suggests ’’that a term ought soon to be put to the present correspondence by informing the Imam that if he cannot come to agreement within a certain time on the points which H.M.G. regard as essential they will oe compelled reluctantly to break off negotiations.” Action on these lines might, he thinks, in view of the Imam's apparent strong aesire for a settlement and the fact that his health is failing and that it is important from his point of view to regularise the relations/ -H m2 . relationo o£ the Yemen with H.L.G. before nis heath, ana the troubles to 'which the Question of succession may give rise, inauce the Imam to clinch the matter by acceptance.

He had interviews with the Itnan hiruself , with Qa.dni Muhaiuni 0 .d Eagheh Bey, the Imam's adviser cr. foreign affairs, and witn Qadhi Abdulla al Amri, the Imam's principal minister, with all of v/horn discussion Y/aa confined to the, difficulties involved in the wording of the third Article of 'Hie propcseu treaty. I authorised Mr. Salih da’far to say that I was willing to consider any verbal modification Y/hich mignt satisfy tire Imam without contravening the instructions of His Majesty's Government by which I was bound. 2. As will be seen from his letter (Aimorure B), the changes -which the Imam has nov; suggested in the third Article are as follows^- (a) He haB substituted the words 'Southern Yemen territories'- for ''southern frontier of the terr-itordee of His Majesty the King of the Yemen'. His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, London*(b) He Has omitted all the words oonunencing ’’it being understood that nothing contained in this article dov/n to the end of the article as worded in the draft forwarded with your Secret despatch dated 14th April, 1932. For this he has sub stituted the following:- n The present situation shall remain as it is now cn the date of the conclusion Df this treaty. As to the Islands of A1 Yemen there shall be no change in their status prejudicial to the original rights of the Government “sf the Yemen’!. 3. The change at (a) may be innocuous, but it raises the old point of the distinction between the political and geographical interpretations of the term 'Yemen”. There is little doubt that in the Imam’s mind the expression ”southern Yemen territories” means the Aden Protectorate, probably including Aden itself, and the use of the word '’Yemen' in a geographical sense tends to obscure the fact that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to recognise the Imam as 'King of the Yemen” only in the political sense which identifies 'Yemen” with the territory that is now actually under his controls On this point the wording proposed in the British draft is therefore preferable and ought if possible, to be retained. 4. The main point with regard to the first part of the alteration in (b) is that the Imam has eliminated all reference to his ora. and to His Majesty's Government's rights in the Protectorate. This avoidance of any mention of conflicting 'rights' and 'claims' is intended to remove one of the principal recent obstacles to agreement, and is, in my opinion, a genuine effort to resolve the deadlock3. and to come to terms. It may be acceptable to His Majesty 1 s Government in spite of the deletion that it involves of a reference to British claims. 5c The omission of the Imanrs explicit undertaking against aggression or interference in the Protectorate is less satisfactory. It may be argued that this undertaking 4 is implied in the Imam's agreement to respect the situation existing at the conclusion (i.e. signature) of the treaty, and in the assurance of peace, friendship and good relations contained in Article II of the Treaty, but I nevertheless consider that the definite undertaking ought to be restored, and that it might be made mutual. 6 0 The Imam's persistence in his claim to unspecified islands presents a serious difficulty. Ragheb Bey assured Mr. Salih Ja'far in conversation that the term 'Islands 1 ’ is not intended to include perinu and said that it referred to the Parsan group, Kamaran and the Banish and other smaller islands in the Red ecao It ha^ been explained to the Imam both in writing and verbally tnat the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne preclude the British Government from entering into any separate engagement with him in relation to these islands, but Mr. Salih Ja'lsr was unable to persuade him to drop this point, although he formed an Impression that I might be able to do so if I were to visit San'a personally* Without suggesting such a possibility to the Imam, I have endeavored to think of a formula on this subject which might satisfy both parties to the treaty, such as a statement that Kis Majesty's Government note, the existence of the Imam's claims to the islands, and that these claims will be borne in mind m any final settlement with regard to the islands to which his Majesty's Government may agree; or, alternatively, uI1&amp; “ some undertaking might he given oi the nature oU 00 estedin my despatch No. 216 dated 27th October 1932 to you. i \ shall he glad to know whether His Majesty's Government would be prepared to consider any compromise on this issue, whether they must insist on the complete exclusion of thi: question from the negotiations. f * ^ r,&gt; Salih Ja f far informed the Imam of my intended journey to India this month (reported to you in my telegram No. 245 dated 7th December 1932) and of the prospect of my going to England on leave in April 3 and the Imam hastened Mr* Salih Ja 1 far’s return to Aden (with the letter v/hose receipt I am now reporting) in the hope of arranging for my visit to San’a to take place between my return from India and my departure to England* The Imam ? who is now an old man has lately been in indifferent health and Mr. Salih Ja'far attributes his increasing anxiety for the conclusion of a treaty to a desire, which is strongly shared by his advisers, to regularise his relations with His Majesty’s Government before his death precixiitates a struggle among his sons for the succession and lays his country open to the danger of foreign penetration- 8. Had the Imam’s letter been more satisfactory, that is to say, had he v/ithdrawn his claim to the islands, and had he given an assurance that his prohibition of Aden-Yemeni land trade would be removed, I should have recommended the immediate acceptance of his invitation to go to San’a, as it appears to me that the question of the Protectorate has now reached a point at which it should be susceptible of a satisfactory solution through personal conversation. But, as it is, I feel that by going to Son’a I should be likely only to involve myself in arguments which, instead ol leading to a final conclusion would result either in failure or in further references to Londono I share the Imam's belief that the British Government do not wish to pass the time indefinitelyin an interchange of letters, and I suggest that a term ought soon to he put to the present correspondence by informing the Imam that, if he cannot come to agreement within a certain time on the points which His Majesty’s Government regard as essential, they will be compelled reluctantly to break off negotiations* In view of his 1 ; apparently strong desire for a settlement a communication of this nature might induce him to clinch the matter by acceptance. 9 C I shall be grateful if you can find it possible to send your reply to this despatch to me by telegram to enable me to communicate the views of His Majesty’s Government to the Imam as soon as possible* I have, etc. , (Signed) B.F.REILLY, Resident, etc.1 AOTEXUR E A JWTRkCTQFROU PO LITICA L nT TSLIiIGENCE SUMMARIES.. 7th pec emher 2I63o MR, SALIH JA J FAR, Political Clerk at HODEIDAH has gone to SANA 7 at the request of the IMAM and with the permission of the Resident.

Ho prospect is seen by His Majesty f s Government of giving Imam, any substantial satisfaction regarding islands (other than coastal rocks or islets which, however are presumably not what he is now concerned about) and they would not be prepared to refer his views on the question of islands to the ohirer signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne. If Treaty is signed the Imam will presumably raise island question and you would naturally inform him that you will report his representations to His Majesty r s GovernBsrrl, but His Majesty f s Government as at present advised, think you should make it clear in undertaking to do this that you have no reason to suppose that they will feel able to take action in the matter.

TEE CLAI M OF THE IMAM OF T HE YEMEN TO CERTAIN ISLANDS IN THE RED SEA . Memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office. This question appears to have first come into prominence during the negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty between His Majesty’s Government and the Yemen, which were revived in 1931 with an attempt on the part of the Imam to include in Article III of the draft treaty a reference to ,! the settlement of the two qriestions oi the southern frontier of the Yemen and the Islands of the Yemen.' The Imam did not name the islands, but in reporting the matter, the Resident at Aden said that the phrase was probably intended to cover Kamaran, Perim, the Hanish and Jebel Zukur Group, and possibly the Parsan Islands, At the same time the Resident pointed out that the sovereignty of Kamaran and the Hanish and Jebel Zukur Islands was undecided and expressed the view that there might be no harm in letting the Iman reserve a hypothetical claim to them to be decided at a later date. 2. All the islands in question, except the Parsan Islands (which were at one time part of the territories of the Idrisi and are now tacitly recognised as being under Ibn baud sovereignty), were formerly Turkish (with the exception of Perim) and fall to be dealt with under Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, which reads as follows.- - 1 -'Turkey hereby renounces all rights and title whatsoever over or respecting the territories situated outside the frontiers laid down in the present Treaty and the islands other than those over which her sovereignty is recognised by the said Treaty 3 the future of these territories and islands being settled or to be settled'by the parties concerned.' 3. The Imam’s proposal to include a reference to these islands in the draft treaty was discussed with other cognate matters at a meeting of the Standing Official Sub -Committee on Middle East Affairs on the 11th of December^ 1931, at which the following views were expressed by the representatives of the various Departments. 4. Admiralty . Any reference to the islands should be omitted. There could be no question of the sovereignty of Perim and several claimants were already in existence to the other islands. It was obviously undesirable to imply that an additional claim on the part of the Imam should be added thereto. 5. Foreign Office. In view of the provisions of Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, His Majesty's Government are not free to enter into any bilateral engagement with the Imam in relation to these islands. It would be preferable from every point of view to omit any reference to the islands from the draft treaty. 6. nolonial Office . Agreed that any reference to the islands should be omitted. 7. The views of the Air Staff were circulated previously to members of the Sub-Committee and were to the effect that the Imam should be required to omit his reference in Article III to the „ ^ ^ „ m hp sovereignty of Perim ? which had been 'Islands of the Yemen'. ihe b0vexe±8^^ .. . ^ a tzn' pouid not be called in quest ion 5 occupied continuously since 9 even a hypothetical claim on the part of the Imam to the islands should not be allowed, in view of their strategic value. S. mu. mating agreed that it would be desirable to omit a reference to the islands of the Yemen in the treaty. 9. A counter draft of the proposed treaty wasas agreed at the sent out to Aden with Article III amended 'll . meeting, and the position was at the same time explained to the Residentj who in turn informed the Imam that His Majesty’s •§ Government were not free to enter into any bilateral engage ments in regard to the islands, 10«, The Imam, however, was not ready to abandon his wording of Article III, and in reporting this attitude, the Resident expressed the opinion that he should be informed that His Majesty's Government had in their desire to meet his wishes with regard to Article III gone as far as they could. The question was again considered at a meeting of the Sub-Committee on the 4th of July, 1932, at which the following views were expressed. 11, AdmireIty, Re-affirmed the position already taken up, but thought that if the Imam merely wished to claim some of the islets and reefs in the immediate vicinity of his coast, it is unlikely that there would be any objection. It was thought better that the Imam should not at present be asked to state to what islands he laid claim as it might be awkward to have to break off negotiations as a result of such a definition, 12, India Office, Considered that for the moment we should stand firm on our previous communication to the Imam and see what he had to say. If it turned out at a later stage that he was merely concerned with the ownership of islets and reefs near the coast of no importance, no difficulty need arise in meeting him over this, but past discussions went to show that this was not the meaning normally attached by the Imam to the word ”islands” in this connection. The simplest course would appear to be to reply in the sense recommended by the Resident, Foreign Office. 13. Agreed with the views previously^expressed, tut considered that the wording contained in His Majesty's Government's draft of Article III that 'nothing contained in tiiis Article, on in otiier Articles of tiie present Treaty, is to 'be taken as meaning that either of the High Contracting Parties renounces the rights claimed by him in those regions ,f should be retained. Colonial Office . Agreed with the views previously expresse d. 15 • Aj^rj ilnistry, Considered it would be undesirable and premature to make any variation in the wording of Article III. 16 * The meeting agreed that the Resident should be informed that His Majesty's Government have gone as far as they can to meet the Imam's wishes with regard to Article III. The Resident was informed accordingly and in turn notified the Imam. 17. No further official communication has been received from the Imam, but in October last a certain Mr. Bailey reported to the Resident a conversation which he had had with the Imam on the subject of the islands during a recent visit to the latter in connection with the salt concession at Salif. According to this information the Imam is particularly con cerned at the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to agree to consider his claim to the islands. In reply to the Imam, Mr. Bailey, while disclaiming any knowledge of political questions, said that he felt certain that the British Govern ment would not admit any claim to Perim, and pointed out that, as far as he knew, the remaining islands were international and in any case were barren and worthless. The Imam replied that nevertheless they were part of the Yemen.18 0 In response to these unofficial overtures, the Resident addressed a letter to the Imam on the 22nd ^ of October 193/d re—affirming his willingness to go to Sanaa on the fulfilment of the preliminary conditions imposed by His Majesty’s Government (namely the acceptance by the Imam of the present wording of Article III and the raising of the overland trade embargo). He made no reference in this letter to his conversation with Mr. Bailey, nor did he specifically mention the islands. 19, In reporting the matter the Resident made the following suggestions, which he thought might facilitate the Imam’s acceptance of Article III as at present drafted, ”6 0 With regard to the question of the islands other than Perim, it occurs to me that a re cognition of the Imam’s nominal sovereignty over them - with adequate safeguards against their use as military or naval bases, and for the preservation of the lighthouses and of our special position in Kamaran - is a solution which might find acceptance by the interested Powers. I realise that no undertaking about these islands can be given to the Imam in the treaty; but if you consider that the question might be broached with the other Powers concerned during the period of the treaty, I suggest that I may be authorised (if I go to Sana’) to agree to hear and to represent the Imam’s views on this subject after the signature of the treaty. If so, I should be careful not to give the Imam any promise, explicit or implied that His Majesty’s Govern ment would accept or support his claims. I should simply consent to report his wishes for His Majesty’s Government’s consideration and for possible reference to the other signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne.” 20, The views of the various Departments concerned regarding this suggestion are as follows. 21, Colonial Office . Would not be disposed to agree to any discussion of the Imam’s claim to the islands as a condition precedent to the opening of= Toe authorised, if he goes to Sanaa, to agree to hear and to represent to His Majesty’s Government the views of the Imam on the subject af ter the signature of 'the Treaty, 22o War Office and Tre a sury , Have no observations, 23. Air Ministry . Feel very great doubt as to the advisability of adopting the Resident’s suggestion that he should agree to represent the Imam’s views after a treaty has been signed. They consider that the concession of even a nominal sovereignty of the Imam over any of the Red Sea Islands (from which Perim at least would pre sumably be wholly excluded) would increase the likelihood of intrigue by interested Powers for their actual occupation, which His Majesty’s Government wo,uld then be powerless to counter. They point out that there has been recent and definite evidence of interest by Italy in the Hanish group, the occupation of which would enable her to command the sea route at the southern end of the Red Sea, j Moreover, any suggestion of sovereignty by the Imam over the Farsan Islands would be likely to cause difficulties with Ibn Saud. They feel in general that it would be definitely contrary to British interests and to the maintenance of peaceful conditions in the area con cerned that any ownership should be conceded to the Imam in respect of the Red Sea Islands, and they therefore think it undesirable that any sort of offer to hear and represent his views should be put before him as an inducement to sign a treaty. Indeed, they suggest that it would not be permanently conducive to good relations with the Imam to hold out any suggestion thau the islands are an ’’open question”, if His Majesty’s Government have - 6 --7- ^in fact no intention of admitting any part of his claims. 24 ‘ See no ohjection to the Resident's suggestion, hut they consider it undesirable that His Majesty Government should be committed in any way to raising this difficult question with the other Powers concerned during any particular period. It is possible that acknowledgment of the nominal sovereignty of the Imam over the islands in question (other than Perim) might provide the best way out of the present impasse, provided that the special position of His Majesty's Government at Kamaran, etc., is recognised. On the other hand, the present state of doubtful ownership is in many ways that which best suits the Admiralty. j-PP e -i-8 n 0fijco. Consider that His Majesty’s Government should not be committed, even hypothetically, to referring the views of the Imam to the other signatories of the Ireaty of Lausanne, or to taking any action whatsoever upon them. Moreover, they point out that when this question was discussed at the meeting of the Sub-Committee on the 4th of July 1932 the view was taken that it would be impossible to give the Imam any substantial satisfaction in regard to these islands (other than coastal rocks and islets), and that it would be undesirable for the time being, at any rate, to invite him to define his claims more precisely. They therefore think it would be preferable to postpone further consideration of the point until the Imam's reply to the Resident’s letter of the 22nd of October 1932 has been received. Nevertheless, if the majority of the other Departments concerned hold the view that the suggestion should be approved without further delay,they will not press that consideration of the point should he postponed. 26.

The first letter deals with the general question of the negotiations with the Imam; the second with the Imam's desire for the re-establishment of cable communication between Sheikh o$i£d and rerim. Both have been the subject of unofficial discussion witn the Porelgn Office, as the real It of which it was agreed that we should hold: our hand until they had replied. s. As regards the Imam’s anxiety to re-establish caole communication, the position is briefly that the local agent of the Pastern Telegraph Company is apparently satisfied that there is little or no risk of the Imam being able to obtciin the cable connection tiiat lie desires save tnrough tiie Company. Tde Botmi (pz.iioiini - of-*?adefirarve been asked to confirm tills. Subject to an affirmative reply, we may agree with the Foreign (PZ 01 Tice rfcn'ac c a pting Colonel Reilly's suggestion that we should discourage the Company from completing their agreement with the Imam so long as the Imam maintains his present antagonistic attitude towards British interests and there is no risk of a foreign competitor appearing on the scene. A draft is attached 3. 'The paper on P.Z.7083/32 raises more important questions. We may agree in the first place with the Colonial Office proposal to approve the terms of the letter adaressed by the Resident to the Imam on 22nd October, which is in entire conformity with the instructions sent to Colonel Reilly at an earlier stage from here. We/ !r We may also agree with the Foreign .Office suggestion that the Resident’s attention should he drawn to the undesirability of doing anything to encourage the use of non-official intermediaries such as hr. Bailey or Commander Crawford. 4 . Colonel Reilly’s suggestion that, in the interests of securing the Imam's acceptance of our draft of Article 3 of the proposed treaty, he should he authorised, without in any way committing H.L.G. to acceptance or support of H.F.'s claims to certain islands in the Re d Sea, to agree , /hfter t^eHTi^almire* m y ' ~~^ =r ~ ~ (o f the Treatyy ’’to reporV^n I n nn «i ri p t, i nn p n d f n r nn s p i 1 is” wishes for H.h.G.’s consideration and for possible reference to the other signatories of the treaty of Lausanne' seems very j doubtful. The Colonial Office, as will he seen, are not disposed to agree to any discussion of these claims as a condition precedent to the opening of negotiations likandr-, as the Foreign Office point out, there are strong I objections to committing even hypothetically, [ to referring the views of the Imam to the other i . signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne or to taking any action whatsoever upon them. Apart from this, in the first place it seems questionable whether much play can j| be made in the negotiations with the suggested offer if I it is not to be made until these negotiations have I concluded, while secondly, if there is no prospect of | any advance to meet the Imam on the points in issue, we l^may expose ourselves to a charge of disingenuousness I by action on the lines proposed. However, the point is I not primarily one for the India Office, though we are I of course actively interested in the position of Perim | anci Kainaran , and we may perhaps be content to touch on tne objections ana leave the decision to trie Colonial aifice.

INDIA OFFICEP.Z. 7089/32 ptdential. THE RESIDENCY, 04. ADEN 19th October 1932. Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to paragraph 1779 in Political Intelligence Summary No.261 for the week ending 12th January 1932 despatched under No. 8 of the 13th January 1932, and to forward copies of a correspondence on the subject of the' proposed Perim-Sheikh Said cable which has been supplied to me by the local Manager of the Eastern Telegraph Company. It will be seen that the negotiations between the Company and the Imam’s Government have reached a point at which an agreement jay shortly be drawn up between them. 2. As you are aware the Imam is still holding out on the point of the wording of the Third Article of his proposed treaty with His Majesty’s Government, and he has so f ar sent no reply to my last letter to him on this subject, a copy of which was forwarded to you under my despatch No.174, dated 7th September 1932. At the same time he continues to maintain strictly his embargo on trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate in spite of my representations to him on this subject. *£he object of this embargo appears to be partly economic and partly political. The Imam wishes to divert the overland trade between his country and Aden to the port of Mocha, which he is anxious to revive; and it is probable that he also intends to use this economic pressure on the Protectorate as a weapon with which to bargain for political concessions tros His Majesty’s Government. In practice the embargo causes but little inconvenience to business people in Aden, as to them it is largely a matter of indifference whether their trade with the Majesty’s Secret the Colonies, Yemen/ of state London.2 . Yemen passes by land or by sea. 0 n the other hand the Chiefs and people of those portions of the Protectorate through which the main trade routes pass - notably the Sultan of Lahej and the Amir of Dhala’ - are suffering considerable losses through the diminution in their customary transit dues. 3. It appears to me to be inappropriate that a British firm should assist the Imam in obtaining the economic advantages which the cable connection with Perim may afford him at a time when he on his side is obstructing the path of a political settlement with His Majesty’s Government and is making use of an economic campaign against the British Protectorate in order to gain advantages for himself. I therefore suggest that the Eastern Telegraph Company should be discouraged from completing their agreement with the Imam as long as he maintains his antagonistic attitude towards British interests. It is the Imam’s habit to say that he must defer the settlement of minor questions, such as the exchangsof prisoners, release of hostages and the raising of his embargo, until after the conclusion of a treaty and it may be of advantage to employ similar tactics on oui^ide. 4. I understand from the Aden Manager of the Eastern Telegraph Company that there is little or no risk of the Imam being able to obtain the cable connection that he desires through any agency other than that of the Eastern Telegraph Company.

I am to explain to Your Highness, in reply to your esteemed letter of the 1st Safar 1351 (5th June, 1932), that His Majesty's Government have gone as far as they can in their earnest and sincere desire to meet Your Highness's wishes in regard to the Third Article of the draft submitted by Your Highness, and that their draft of this Article represents the utmost limit of concession 0 c compromise that they can make in its respect* I am also to inform Your Highness that His Majesty's Government are unable to accept any modification in the conditions that they desire shall be fulfilled by Your Highness before the treaty can be signed.

Always it was that reason that compelled and obliged us to carry out the actions to which you have referred. We hesita«,a nowI norr to renew the paina and hurts burled in our hearts, by enumerating end explaining the incidents. We deem it enough to say that when we and Your Excellency meet together and sign the sincere and permanent agreement of friendship between the two Governments, a solution will also be found in the matter of the trade, referred to, in a reasonable manner that will ensure our utmost help in British interests, and will ensure facilities to the English in evary way* fe beg to confirm our respects and our special friendship to Your Excellency, Dated 29 Suf.ar 1351 = 3rd July, 193S.Dated Sfith Kabi Awwal 1351 “ 2?th July, 193S# From Imam Ye hi a bin Muhammad Hamid Uddin Sana ? * ' To lieutenant Colonel B^R.Reilly, Resident and Commander-in-chief* Aden* A« 0 * We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. C/401 dated 11th Rabi El Awwal 1351 (14th July, 193S), on reading which we became exceedingly pleased* We again confirm our previous letter of 1st Safar 1351 (5th June, 1932)* We beg to tender our most sincere thanks for the kindness shown by the Great British Government in well estimating and receiving our fundamental goal and purpose, previously made clear in our former explanations in respect of the 3rd Article, which was referred to with the best intentions in our said letter; (y/e are also grateful) for the kind attention that they have shown to our explanation regarding the stand we have been compelled to make in its respect- We also beg to tender our most sincere thanks for the great and personal interest you have taken in notifying to the illustrious British Government the true facts, and our good will, and for securing confidence and friendship between the two parties. After the solution and disposal of this problemproblem, by the help of Cod, it ie quite inoonoeivable that there would be any matter or subject auoh as to cause delay or obstruction in the (conclusion of the) agreement and concord between the two Goyernments. Aa to the matter of the fixing of the dividing line we shall, by the Will of God, carry out that which will assist (in securing) the demand of the British Government: we will perform it personally, assuredly, and freely* We hope that you particularly will be confident that there will he no change, diminution or defect whatever on our part in (meeting) the wishes of the British Government in this matter. But as regards the nature of the slight change, referred to in our letter dated let Safar 1351 (5th June, 1932), it will affect neither the basis of your demand nor the original line. But if there should occur neglect in the adoption of a peaceful arrangement and proper organisation in regard to the problem, that omission would open a way for confusion and encroachment in the passing to and fro of the people of the places situated on the boundary dividing both sides* That will cause the officials of the two Governments to be disturbed with various frequent incidents end occurrences, and will be undesirable* The object and aim in view is only the organisation and appointment of the (boundary) Line by a good arrangement, and nothing else* And in regard to the whole question, we again confirm our acceptance of the said demand* As Your Excellency is unusually expert and experienced in both administrative and military affairs, during long years, there is no doubt that you understand thistuis situation better than ourselves, and you will appreciate the necessity for skilfully and intelligently arranging the (boundary) line, in order to avoid incidents between the people of both parties* Knowing that you have the full authority of your Great Government, we are sure that you will fully realise our justij-ioation, to which we refer, because you have a better knowledge of the affairs of those parts than any one else* it our meeting, we shall, by the Grace of God, discuss matters with Your Excellency regarding the appointment and organisation of the form of the required (boundary) line, in agreement with you, and in a suitable manner, ensuring security and safety for both parties in the present and in the future. We again repeat our earnest hopes and happy expectation of Your Excellency^ visit, and we shall receive you with sincere respect. We are unable to do all that is necessary to receive you, because of the many deficiencies and of the general conditions here, but we rely on the true and sincere friendship in our heart to cover those deficiencies. We are expecting to receive the good tidings of the day of your visit to us. We confirm our sincere respects.Aden, 3rd September, 1932. spy- )«, c/514. To His Highness Imam Yehia bin Muhammad * bin Hamid-Ud-Din, SAHA 1 • Your Highness, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Highness's letter of the 25th Rabi A1 Awwal 1351 (27th July, 1932) on the subject of negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty between His Majesty's Government and the Yemen, and to inform Your Highness that I have now received the further instructions of His Majesty's Government. 2* I welcome Your Highness's willing confirmation of your acceptance of the conditions which His Majesty's Government consider to be an essential preliminary to the signature of the treaty, namely, the restoration of the territory of the Amir of Bhala' in the Sanah area, of the territories of the Audhali Sultan in A1 Dhaher, and of the hostages whom Your Highness holds from the Audhali tribe* I greatly appreciate Your Highness's assurances on this subject, which go far to facilitate the way for the successful conclusion of our negotiations. 3. with regard to the draft treaty only one substantial point appears now to remain at issue. Ihis is the third Article with regard to which we are not yet in complete agreement* If Your Highness will compare thethe draft of this Article communicated to you in ^ letter * 0 . C/ 25 7 of the 7th Kay, 1932, with previous drafts which have been put forward by the British Government, you will realise that His Majesty's Government have gone to a great length in their desire to meet Your Highness's views. They have made their draft approximate as nearly as possible to that contained in Your Highness' letter of the 10th Rubi al Thani 1350 (and September, 1931), but they cannot go further in this respect than they have already done. I have explained the reasons for their attitude in my letter Ho, C/257 of the 7th May, 1932, and I shall now endeavour to elucidate this matter more clearly in order that Your Highness can fully understand the reasons which compel His Majesty ? s Gorernment to make a stand on this pointo Mrstl^r there is reference in Your Highnesses draft to the 'Islands of the Yemen'* Your Highness has not mentioned the names of the Islands which you have in mind, but I assume that you refer to certain Islands situated in the Red Sea* The question of the future disposal of these Islands was dealt with in one of the clauses of the Treaty of Lausanne signed in 1923 at the conclusion of the War between Turkey and the Allied Powers* The British Government was a party to that Treaty, and it is thereby bound not to enter into any agreement with regard to these Islands without the assent of the other Allied Governments who were signatories to the Treaty* It is therefore impossible for the British Government to deal with the question of these Islands in aa separate treaty with Your Highness, as questions regarding them can. be decided oniy by general ccnsent of the CrOYernments concerned* Secondly in Your Highness’s draft you have referred to certain Original rights”, whereas His Majesty’s Government in their counter draft have used the expression 'rights claimed'. 'The essence of this Article is that the question of rights is to be left in abeyance, and that in the meanwhile neither Government will relinquish its claims in the region concerned, nor specifically recognise the claims of the other. For practical purposes it is proposed that the position shall remain as it will be at the time of the signature of the treaty* This is a compromise which can be accepted by both Governments without loss of honour or dignity, but it is essential that neither party must require from the other either a renunciation or an admission of their respective claims* The use of the word 'rights ,r in distinction to the words 'rights claimed' would imply an admission which His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to mafce* Xt is for this reason that/ they cannot go further than they have done in the modification of the wording of this clause* The draft which they have mane indicates a mutual and reciprocal consideration on the part of each Government for the views of the other, and for this reason it ought to be acceptabxe to Your Highnes As His Majesty’s Government are unwilling to recede from this position X regret that it would be useless for mo to go to Sana’ to complete these negotiations unless /our Highness is prepared to accept the wording of Article XXXI as drafted in my letter of the 7th May, 1932 .. Aa disagreement with regard to the draft treaty has now been reduced to the question of the wording of this one Article and as complete accord appears to be assured on all other points of substance, I trust that Your Highness will now remove this one remaining obstacle by accepting the full explanations that I have now given to you and by agreeing to the Third Article as provided by His Majesty^ Government, At the same time X have the honour to refer to my letter Ho. c/346 of the 21st June, 1932, regarding Your Highness T s restrictions on the overland trade between the Yemen and Aden, which have in no degree been relaxed as the result of toy representation to you, 'While I have noted Your Highness’s reply of the 29th Safar 1351 (3rd July, 1932) to the effect that a solution of this matter will be found by discussion, after the signature of the treaty. Your Highness will appreciate that a continuance of this embargo is inconsistent with the sentiments of cordiality that actuated Your Highness’s invitation to me, and would be incompatible with the friendly and conciliatory purposes of my proposed visit to you in Sana** It is my sincere hope that Your Highness will be pleased to receive this letter in the amicable and friendly spirit in which it is composed, and that the terms of Your Highness T s reply will be so favourable and explicit as to enable these long-drawn-out negotiations to be resumed and concluded by my personal visit to Your Highness in Sana 1 *I take this opportunity to convey to Tour Highness the expression of my high esteem and regard.

In these circumstances it is proposed that the Resident should be authorised to proceed as he suggests in the third paragraph of his despatch, namely, to attempt to secure a strengthening of the wording of Article 5 of the draft Treaty, Sub-section 1 of which would then read as follows:- CB UNDER SECRETARY OF STAT INDIA OFFICE.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your secret despatch of the 26th July on the subject of Article v of the draft treaty with the Imam of the Yemen. * ‘ fe 0 % icts Meiti® Sir SaieiJi ,ent senact, GUjl 2. It is in ray opinion inconceivable that the Imam will consent to the establishment of special tribunals for the operation of a privileged code of law for foreign nationals, whether Moslem or otherwise. The dispensation of the bheria Law is one of the main foundations upon which the Yemen Btate is built, and a relaxation of it would alienate from the imam much of the support upon which he now relies for the maintenance of his autnority. he is extremely jealous of the preservation of his full and absolute sovereignty in Ms dominions, and I am convinced that he would not admit the establishment of any foreign (e.g.Consular) jurisdiction therein, ids rigid attitude on this point is understood to have been the cause of the breakdown of the G-erman-Yemeni treaty negotiations in 1931 (vide Appendix to Political Intelligence numnary paragraph 1675). The italo-Yemeni treaty of 1926 (vide l^r.Amery’s Secret despatch of the 19th October 1926) is notably silent in this respect, while the Hus so-Yemeni treaty of 1928 (vide Bir E. Byrnes 1 Secret despatch No. 115 of the 23rd July 1929) prescribes national treatment. 3. Article V( i) of Ms Majesty 1 s Government’s present draft treaty, (which follows the lines of the Imam’s draft of September ,1930) provides for most- favoured-nation treatment, and suggests national treatment in the . pnrase s Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies,London., A' pnrase, 'shall be amenable to the local laws*, it mas be advisable to strengthen this clause by the adoption of the wording proposed In paragraph 4 of your despatch. 1 snail endeavour to secure this addition if the negotiations proceed, for although there is some risk that national treatment may be disadvantageous to non-Moslem British subjects in the Yemen, no non- Moslem foreigner can hope for the concession of any exclusive Judicial privileges under the present regime in tuai country• appointment oi a permanent British representative at Sana' as a sequel to the estabiiehment of treaty relations should in practice provide a safeguard for the juridical rights of British subjects in the Yemen. inis, and the effect of the proposed amendment of Article V( i) in His Majesty's Government's draft treaty are the best guarantees on this point taat are likely to be obtainable in present circumstances and in my opinion it will be unwise to press for anything further.

The Government of India’s telegram of 4 th August is not very clearly expressed. But it appears that they agree that India should be a separate signatory of the treaty with the Imam if this materialises and that the Resident should be given.full power for this purpose. 3. On relatively minor points which have been the subject since of correspondence with the Imperial departments concerned they at once agree with the Foreign Office suggestion in paragraph 4 of their letter of 17th June on P.Z. 3579/32 that the Resident should report further before agreeing to any provisions dealing with the question of the judicial treatment to be accorded to British subjects in the Yemen and with our counter-suggestion that this point might best be met by a rewording on the lines suggested in paragraph 1 of our letter of 4th July on P.Z. 3867/32. The point is of no immediate practical importance, since it has now been agreed to leave this question (see P.Z. 4320/32) to a large extent to Colonel Reilly’s discretionv(1®iile communicating for his infoimation tne India Office suggestion, which the other departments are prepared in certain circumstances to accept, to instruct him to report further before he agrees to any treaty provision. The/— I 4. The Government of India finally suggest, subject to the views of the Board of Trade, the insertion in the draft treaty of a provision to secure M.P.N. treatment for goods. The original treaty that Sir Gilbert Clayton endeavoured to negotiate with the Imam in 1926 did, in fact, contain a provision governing the treatment of goods. But since then we have let this question drop and have concentrated on securing a satisfactory political treaty, leaving the question of goods to be taken up in the light of such a treaty at some later date. It is not one of really first class importance and the important thing is to secure the re-establishment of friendly relations with the Imanz Once we have done this a trade agreement might follow. But it would, I think, be dangerous to complicate the negotiations at the present stage by introducing the question of the treatment of goods. While communicating^^he Government of India’s suggestion to the interested Imperial departments, I do not think we ^iould press it. Incidentally, it is essentially a matter for the political departments and not for the Board of Trade. 5.

It will be seen that the Government of India agree that it is desirable that India should be a separate signatory of the proposed treaty and that the at Aden should be given a full power for this purpose. It has already been agreed that Colonel Reilly will have to refer home for sanction in the event of his wishing to agree to any alterations in the treaty other than verbal or minor alterations only. j I' ^ ^ 3. Instructions have now been L sent to Colonel Reilly on the as to the line to be taken/taken in connection with the insertion of provisions in the proposed treaty to cover the question of national or most favoured nation treatment in judicial matters for British subjects. 4. In the last paragraph of their telegram the Government of India suggest ^55 consideration of an addition to the draft treaty with the object of securing most favoured nation treatment for the goods of high contracting parties. A provision of this nature figured in the treaty which the i a+.p sir* Gilbert Clayton e negotiations were unfruitful and th treaties which have been considered since 1928 have,witiout e xcoption, concentrated on securing a satisfactory solution of the political difficulties between H#M*G. and the Imam, leaving the question of most favoured nation treatment for goods for subsequent discussion.

We have now received the text of the Imam's letter in reply to the British counter draft and the offer accompanying 'Pz4'?(2j ^ ^ visit to Sanaa by the Resident. The letter is certainly, as Colonel Reilly remarked j at the time, exceedingly cordial in terms, but it remains to be seen whether the Imam,who emphasises the importance of the third Article of the treaty and the necessity fran his point of view of ensuring 'certain political and administrative requirements and obligations that our position, status and responsibility as imam compel** us to maintain'.will be prepared to meet us on this point. At the moment we are/are awaiting His Highness’s reply to the communication informing him that we were unable to make any further concession in regard to Article 3 (or as regards the necessary pre-conditions to the conclusion of a treaty) which the Resident was instructed to communicate to him in Colonial Office telegram of 11th July on P.Z. 4166/32. Pznzo The Most-Favoured-Nation Article in the proposed Treaty 2. Please see on this the notes on P.Z.3867/32. It will be seen from the Foreign Office letter of 16th July, to the Colonial Office, that the Foreign Office, while prepared to accept our proposal^should it prove impracticable or appear on further examination unnecessary to contemplate the establishment of special tribunals to deal with cases where British subjects, or at any rate non-Moslem British subjects were concerned, would prefer at this stage not to tie the Resident’s hands but to leave him free to examine the whole question in the light of any information that he may be able to obtain at Sanaa, and to report further before agreeing to any treaty provision on this point. The Colonial Office, who were anxious to despatch immediate instructions to the Resident and who themselves agreedwith the Foreign Office proposals, enquired demi-officially whether we saw any objection to action on these lines. The point is not one of very great importance, and our official letter of 4th July on P.Z.3867 indicated that we had no strong feeling on it.

Lord LAMINGTON rose to ask His Majesty’s Government as to the present position of our relations with the Yemen, and with special reference to a treaty being made with the Imam; also to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a Question with which I have often on previous occasions worried your Lordships. It has reference to the Aden Protectorate and the neighbouring State of the Yemen. I would like to have information on the points which I have put down upon the Paper. A few months ago there was a possibility of the Imam coming to some agreement, and I think that perhaps there is now a great likeli hood of his doing so. He has passed through trouble. He has lost one son who was drowned, another son is ill, and he himself is in very bad health. At this late hour I will not say anything further, but will ask |or the information. I trust that under the conditions I have named the Imam may be more reconciled to come into an agreement with us as to the making of a treaty. The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for WAR (Earl Stanhope) : My Lords, I may be able to give my noble friend some information on this subject which I think will at any rate be to some extent pleasing to him, knowing how keen he has been for many years that an agree ment should be arrived at between the Imam and this country. Since the date on which the noble Lord last raised this matter in the House, further communi cations have passed between His Highness the Imam of the Yemen and the Resident at Aden, and I am glad to be able to say that they have been of a friendly nature. In October last the Imam put forward proposals for a treaty which were carefully considered by His Majesty’s Government, who replied through the Resident that they considered that the draft provided a suitable foundation for treaty negotiations, subject to certain modifications embodied in a revised draft which His Majesty’s Government had Viscount L ailsham . drawn up. They regarded it as an essen tial preliminary condition to the signature of the treaty that certain territories and subjects of Chiefs under their protection still held by the Imam should be peace fully restored without damage or detri ment to person or property. In regard to that I may say that when my noble friend asked the question in December, 1930, there were some forty hostages held by the Imam. I understand that since that date he has released more than half of them, and so the number is materially reduced. But His Majesty’s Government are still of opinion that they cannot enter into negotiations until the hostages have been released. Subject to acceptance of this condition, a settlement by mutual agreement would be achieved most effec tively and speedily by direct and personal negotiations rather than by further correspondence. The Imam was further informed that, if he was prepared to proceed with nego tiations on the lines indicated, the Resi dent (Lieut.-Colonel B. R. Reilly) would visit him at Sanaa as soon as could be conveniently arranged. His High ness has replied within the last few days raising certain points of importance, and these are now under consideration. I can assure your Lordships that His Majesty’s Government welcome and re ciprocate His Highness the Imam’s desire for a settlement, and they earnestly hope that it may be found possible to arrive at a satisfactory solution of this long out standing matter. I am afraid I have no Papers at this stage to lay because, as your Lordships will understand, while negotiations are going on it would be in advisable to lay a draft treaty or the treaty which is proposed by the Imam. Lord LAMINGTON: My Lords, the tiswer which the noble Earl has given L e is more satisfactory than the 'answers hich I have had in the past. I under- ;and that it is possible our representa- ve may go to Sanaa to negotiate per- mally. I do not know if our repre- mtative will be Colonel Reilly. I think mryone would have the greatest con- dence in him. We could not have a etter emissary. I hope good results will illow. It ought to be realised that the oviet Government are making ■emendous efforts to get the Imam under ie ir control. There is no doubt that • r .1 Russia ere who would have great influence th the Imam, and his influence wrU not confined to the Imam but will extend I over Arabia. It is therefore import^ at we should oome to a friendly under Ending, and have a clear agreement ■tween the Imam and the Crown, i S to hear that he still has some .stages. I thought they had all been leased. I trust that he may see the isdom of releasing them so that he may i able to co-operate more ire ® ^ W1 ^ is Majesty’s Government.

A.C. We write this to acknowledge receipt of your letter Mo.G/E57 dated 1st Muharrum 1351 (7th May 1932) together with the draft treaty attached thereto. We hay® received them with thanks find pleasure and having care fully perused them we bee me the more delighted that your Honourable Government had authorised Your .zeelleney to conclude the treaty. &amp; became certain that by God’s will the desired object would be achieved. By Your Excellency 1 s presence the opportunity has now come of making its conclusion a certainty, in a manner suitable to both parties. Wo beg thankfully to declare to Your Excellency that we willingly agree to negotiate and discuss all the articles embodied in the draft treaty you have been good enough to despatch to us, for, being in accord with the principles and conditions of the draft previously submitted to you by us, it is worthy of consideration, fhc third Article of this auspicious treaty is the sole tsaaia on whioh the desired covenant can be built and It is the very spirit of the treaty itself. Realising all ^ «l n ,****.«%&lt;*•» the delicate and important points involve a. Your Sxaelleoejr knows that the conolusien of the treaty has be«n unfortunately prejudiced by many adjournments during several years. I’he only reason for this was the composition yjcomposition of this third Article and failure (to agree) as to its phrasing. We think that there is no just reason or real necessity for alteration of the wording of the said article in the draft previously submitted to you by us, for the phrases composed by ue safeguarded the interests of the British Government, which were acceptable f to us. In as far aa the text of the said Article is concerned, we had to take great care, while framing those phrase©, to ensure certain political and administrative requirements and obligations that our position, status and responsibility as Imam compelled us to maintain. I'he , form of these phrases comprehends both the material objects of the British Government and our obligation© as a Ruler. We will explain in detail to Your excellency our objects and points of view. hen you fully consider our clear and proved intentions, we have no doubt whatever that you will be absolutely convinced that in holding to the form of the said article w© entertain no motive prejudicial to the present or future interest© of the British Government. We desire to mention to Your Excellency that we have previously received accurate information from a reliable source that from among the political and administrative high officials that the British Government has produced, Your Hlxeellency is eminently capable of dealing effectively with all matters and disputes because of your knowledge of affairs and your interest in everything beneficial, besides tu© well known benevolence with which you are endowed. W© are to-day thankful and proud to see the nobly position to which we have In effect visibly attained and which we have personally witnessed, and we vorily believe the accuracyaccuracy of the news previously conveyed to us* Therefore, we, having regard to the noble qualities Your i&amp;ooll$ney possesses, beg to assure you that we shall be more friendly to the British Government than any of their existing and cnown allies* Ife shall also be more firm (in friendship), more honest, more useful and more helpful* This line of conduct will be as a covenant and rule of action that our Government and kingdom will observe. m therefore most eagerly and gladly await your honouring u© by your visit, and your early communication with us in its regard, in view of our true hopes and sincere and cordial friendship* We beg you to be confident that we shall accept the delegate of the beloved British Government and their eminent j 1 snipotentiary with great pleasure and delight. We will then combine in devoting all our energies to reconciling the interests of England with the purposes of the Yemen in the articles of the treaty, by full agreement and confidence and in sincere friendship. When wo meet together having one purpose in view, we shall surely complete and sign It, by the grace of Almighty Goa. It is known to Your Excellency that on the meeting of both parties in a spirit of noble hope and good intention, there is no doubt that perfect security and lull and final agreement will be reached, and confidence will be created, established and strengthened now and hereafter. ion may rest assured that by participating with Your Excellency we shall consider not only our own benefit, but also the Interests and advantages of the British Government, on an equal footing and without distinction, and we shall thus reap fruitful results in the way we both wish, las halm. Should we have any other request, your support of it will indicateindioate your regard towards us, and there will be reoi^rooal treatment in harmony with the interest and ideas that we maintain. We also assure you that the treaty haring been agreed to, there will be no shortcoming (on our pert) in carrying out and peacefully executing the terms and conditions embodied in your esteemed letter, subject to certain necessary but unobjectionable minor modiiications that will nevertheless carry conviction and safety to both parties. ! e therefore request Tour dxoellenoy to notify us of the date of your arrival in order that ?/e can make all the preparations necessary for Your Excellency, for we are anxiously awaiting Your Excellency’s visit.

Your Highness, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Highness 1 s letter of the 1st Safer 1351 « (5th June 1932) on the subject of the negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty between His Majesty 1 s Government and the Yemen, and I hasten to express to Your Highness my very sincere appreciation of your prompt and cordial invitation to me to visit Your Highness at Sana 1 . I reciprocate your hopes that our personal and direct discussions may bring the long*delayed question of the treaty to a speedy raid satisfactory conclusion. In view of the fact, however, that Tour Highness has undertaken only a partial and reserved acceptance of the conditions that His Majesty’s Government desire Your Highness to fulfill before the treaty can b© signed, and that Your Higtiness is disinclined to accept His majesty’s Government’s wording of Article III of the draft treaty, I have been reluctantly coispelled to reier thr terms of Your Highness’s letter by telegraph to- His Majesty’s Government for their further instructions. I hope to be able to communicate with lour Highness again in this matter in the very near future and I trust that in the meantime Your Highness will have been pleased to reply to my letter Mo.0/346 of the 21st June 1932 regarding the overland trade between the Yemen and Aden in a manner that will dispose ox this difficulty to our mutual satisfaction.1 I take this opportunity to oonTey to lour Highness the expression of my high esteem and regard, (Signed) B.R.Reilly, Resident and C-in-G. , Men.1 O.C/346, file Hesideiiey, Aden, iilst June, 1932. TO His Highness Imam Yehia bin M Sana *. Muhammad Hamid Uddin, Your Highness, I have the honour to Invite Your Highness’s attention to information that X have lately received to the effect that by Your Highness f a decree, the transport of merchandise (except perishables and fruit) between the Yemen and Aden, on the overland trade routes in the Yemen, has been prohibited under penalty of confiscation of any such merchandise transported in contravention of the decree, whether it emanates from the Aden side of the boundary or from the Yemen. In view of the fact that such an embargo must inevitably cause loss and annoyance to British subjects trading in .Aden and to many other British protected persons, and is likely to react unfavourably on the mutual friendly relations that we both desire to maintain .and perpetuate, X aifi surprised that Your Highness should have taken this very drastic step without giving me any previous information or indication of Your Highness s intentions. It has been suggested to me that the reason underlying Tour Highness'a action may be that some of Your Highness'a subjects have been molested by unruly tribesmen in the Aden Protectorate. If this suggestion ie correct Tour Highness may be assured that I deplore anyI r V suoli illegal aots no- less than Tour Higlxiiesa, and ■that when inseouriti^ on the trade routes occurs steps are taken by the Chiefs concerned to prevent it, under ray instructions and with my assistance, in the interests of peaceful trade and general prosperity* Furthermore I have the honour to point out to Your Highness that the terms of the decree and the manner in which it was made, and particularly the further continuance in present circumstances of Your Highness’s restrictions on the overland trade hetween the Yemen and Aden would appear to he inconsistent with the very friendly and cordial good-will towards His Majesty’s Government and the interests of Great Britain that Your Highness has so convincingly expressed in correspondence both now and in the past* It is therefore my sincere hope that Your Highness will remove these restrictions, that are harmful to traders on both sides of the frontier, without delay, in consideration of the relations of mutual confidence and peaceful friendship that will, Inshalla, soon be confirmed by treaty* (Signed) B.H.Reilly.

Perhaps this could he taken first with the Resident’s enquiry later in the telegram as to latitude to he allowed him in the negotiations. MR, CO’ALL understood that these modifications referred to the actual territorial limits to which withdrawal would be made hy the Imam, MR. RENLEL was inclined to think that these limits had been definitely laid down as a necessary pre-condition to the conclusion of a treaty, and that on this question no latitude could he given. He thought it more likely that what the Resident had in mind was that some freedom should he given to him as regards the actual v/ording of the treaty. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE agreed that there could he no latitude on the question of the necessary pre-conditions, and said that it seemed evident from the v/ording of the Resident’s telegram that he appreciated this. THE CHAIRMAN agreed that what the Resident desired was authority to vary the wording and make minor alterations in the text of the treaty. Any point of substantial importance that might arise during the negotiations would, he assumed, he referred home by telegram. MR. AuRMER pointed out that there might be difficulties in communicating by telegram from Sanaa* and said that it was Possibly with a view to reducing the need for telegraphing that the Resident desired discretion on minor points.CAPTAIN CTJNNINGHAM said that Go\ r ernm 0 nt had bean fully explaiaa the policy of His d to the He silent Majesty* } who roigiiu tnej.efore aa.^ely og allowed complete freedom within the limits outlined therein* CONCLUSION 3 The Sub~0ommi11 e e agreed;- That the necessary pre-conditions to the conclusion of a treaty as previously laid down must be adhered to, but that the Resident at Aden should be allowed latitude as regards re-wording the treaty on any points of minor importance. THE CHAIRMAN said the second question referred to the wording of Article 3 of the proposed treaty, since the Imam wished to adhere to his original wording. Two points arose on this question. The first related to the Southern frontier of the Yemen and the 'Islands of the Yemen', and the second arose out of the question of the 'rights' claimed by the two contracting parties.. CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM stated that it was not clear exactly what islands the Xman referred to. We could entertain no claims for the ownership of Perim, while the future of such islands as Kama ran, Jebel—Sulmr and Banish had, by the Treaty of Lausanne, been left for subsequent settlement by the Powers concerned. Should the Iman however merely wish to claim some of the islets and reefo in the immediate vicinity oi his coast, it was unlihely that there w r ould be any objection, MR, LAITKWAITE suggested that we should for the moment stand firm on our previous communication to the Imam on the subject of the islands and see what he had to say. Ifeither now or at a later stage, it turned out that he was concerned merely about the ownership of islets or reefs near the coast of no importance, no difficulty need arise in meeting him over this, but our past discussions went to show that this was not the meaning normally attached by the Imam to the word '’islands” in this connection. Was not the simplest course to return a reply in the sense recommended by the Resident, and consider the matter further, if necessary, in the light of the reply? Our position was a strong one, and broadly speaking we had nothing material to lose and everything to gain by playing a waiting game. CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM thought it better that the Imam should not at present be asked to state to what islands he laid claim, as it might be awkward to have to break off negotiations as a result of such a definition. MR, REN DEL agreed. He also considered that the wording contained in His Majesty’s Government’s draft of Article 3, that 'nothing contained in this Article or any other Articles of the present Treaty is to be taken as meaning that either of the High Contracting Parties ienounces the rights claimed by him in those regions” should be retained MR. COWELL agreed. GROUP CAPTAIN PBIRSE considered that it would be un desirable and premature to make any variation in the wordingT^i ^1 S3SSI M CONCLUSION.

The Foreign Office proposals in paras.2-4 of their letter to the Colonial Office (P. Z. 3579/32) do not appear to differ, in fact, very greatly. Some play is made with the possibility of obtaining special tribunals, and it is suggested that Colonel Reilly, after collecting such information as he can at Sanaa, should report before finally committing His Majesty’s Government. It is submitted that we may concur in the more cautious attitude of the Foreign Office. (Sgd.) A.F.Morley, 28.6.32. Draft to C.0. On the point discussed in Mr.Morley’s minute Mr.Walt on suggests that while we may be content to accept the Foreign Office view it is conceivable that an amendment of Article V so that the**' last three lines shall run as follows:- M . . . and shall receive treatment not less favourable than that enjoyed by the subjects of the nther^contracting party or t he subjects _ ^ ■ or citizens of any other foreign country.' might meet the case. We might mention this in replying to the Colonial Office while indicating that we have no strong view on the subject. In/In this connection it will be remembered that in the negotiations for the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 with Ibn Saud, with the concurrence of the Government of India, while deciding that no attempt should be made to enforce recognition of our capitulatory rights in the Treaty, equally refused to include in the Treaty any provision formally renouncing those rights. The ultimate (and present) position broadly was that H.M.G. were prepared to recognise the jurisdiction of the Hejazi Courts, relying on their own prestige and the efforts of the Legation to prevent grave injustice being done, and endeavouring where possible to secure the settlement out of court of cases in which British subjects are concerned.

The Imam's reply has now been received ''and is summarised in the Resident's telegram of 21st June on P.Z.3867/32.

Article V, para.3 (a) of the draft treaty provides that the word ’’territories” ”shall be deemed to mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, India and all His Majesty’s Colonies ...”'1 The Colonial Office have raised the question whether,in view of this, the treaty ought not to be signed for India as well as for Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It seems clear that India ought to be a signatory, and a draft telegram consulting the Government of India, who will by now have had copies of our draft treaty, is submitted. /. 2 .Draft Paper, ^7 DRAFT 1 LBTTjnP^ The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, Sir, NO. ?27 i , i0M bcCRtTARY, POL'. “ ' SECRET DEPT.

While on the subject of the security of trade mi all other routes, the difference 'between the free mmmni in 41 Yemen and Urn uncertain travel of the Protectorate is oust marked. ihere is no doubt aoout the way the Eeidi -lovermfmnt keeps order in .41 Yr- mi, and. even the poorest, unarmed man can move about anywhere in perfect safety, mi $ in dhafa*i districts at any rate, it . is at the expense of the prosperity and happiness of the r J civilian, ihe cringing attitude of the peasant class one meets out riding or walking is pitiable and di^psting to see -when one is used to the proud mi independent bedouin, bhty even salaam u&gt; the soldiery, .and toe military rrueeianism which is Urn thing that i^reseed m mat in our tour through a Yemen 6 years ^, 0 with the Clayton Us®ion, had no diminished in toe leant degree.

But Im replied that he f considered that m effective enough the case of man was a law unto himself, that spent md m example 'being made of the offenders such aa would be a future deterrent to the whole tribe against further incidents of the kind. Later on, he mid Qadhi Husain repeated their conviction that the surrender of the Subeihi was the trust important thing to be aimed at and ‘ the payment of blood-money was a minor matter in comparison.

It documents (from a British perspective) the progress of treaty negotiations between Britain and Yemen. Much of the correspondence discusses the terms of the proposed treaty between Britain and Yemen, including a contested third article from a draft treaty proposed by the Imam, which relates both to the southern frontier of Yemen and to the Imam's claim to a number of unspecified islands situated in the Red Sea (referred to as 'the Islands of Yemen' in the Imam's draft treaty).Other items of discussion related to the proposed treaty include:Whether India should be a separate signatory of the proposed treaty.Whether the Imam is likely to consent to the establishment of special tribunals for the practice of a privileged code of law for foreign nationals in Yemen.The British precondition that, prior to the treaty being signed, the Imam must remove all restrictions on overland trade between Yemen and the Aden Protectorate, as well as surrender the territories and subjects of those chiefs who are in treaty relations with the British.The possibility of the appointment of a permanent British representative at San'a.The volume's main correspondents are the following: the Political Resident and Commander-in-Chief (later referred to as the Chief Commissioner) at Aden (Bernard Rawdon Reilly and his Acting Resident, Reginald Stuart Champion), the Imam of Yemen, the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Philip Cunliffe-Lister), and officials of the India Office, the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office, and the War Office respectively.In addition to correspondence, the volume also includes the following:Copies of minutes from meetings of the Imperial Defence Committee's Standing Official Sub-Committee for questions concerning the Middle East, which discuss the proposed treaty with Yemen.A copy of a report of an eighteen-day British medical mission (comprised of two doctors, two nurses, and Lieutenant-Colonel Morice Challoner Lake) to Taiz [Ta‘izz] in late 1931 and early 1932, which was undertaken for the purpose of treating the daughter-in-law of Seyyid 'Ali of Taiz, son-in-law of the Imam.A copy of a report of Lake's subsequent visit to San'a in January 1932, which recounts in detail his conversations with the Imam.Copies of both a draft treaty and a 'retabulated' draft treaty, drafted by the British in response to the Imam's initial draft treaty.Copies of political intelligence summaries from the Aden Residency.The volume includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the volume by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Committee of Imperial Defence, Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imam of Yemen</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00025f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
