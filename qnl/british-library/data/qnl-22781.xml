H. died xX A.M. the n.xt day. He was a permanent resident of Dubai and had never left tha place. On tha 4th November^..M. Tha local doctor was again sent for to sea one Khambar a^arsian resident of Dubai who had tha tha sy.me Symptoms as tha previous case,realizing their severity ha called in tha M.O. Dr. Mahmud Yassin. Tha latter who has had axparianca of Cholera in Amritsar assured me that in his opinion tha case was undoubtedly Cholera. Tha man died at sunset. A third case exhibiting similar symptoms a Baluchi rasidant of Dubai is stated to have died soma time between tha 31st Oct. and 4th November. Ha had similar symptoms but nothing definite could be ascartainad regarding him. As far as could be ascertcined tha contacts of tha case which occurred on tha 31st wara still wall on tha 7th evening Tha contacts of tha case of tha 4th November wara removed from their house to another on tha outskirts of tha town. They aftar 3 days wara quite healthy. All tha cases wara permanent residents of Dubai and Shandaqua and had not left tha locality any time. Taking into consideration tha fact that tha symptoms des cribed by both tha local Doctor and tha M.O. wara exactly similar, tha rapid onset, short duration and fatal termination of tha attack both within tha 5 day incubation period of cholera and tha possibility of further cases not being brought to notice, there are ample grounds for considering tha cases to be 'suspected Cholera”. It was unfortunate no material was available for bacteriological examination which would have enabled us to make a definite diagnosis. Under the circumstances Dubai and Sharjah must be considered as infected localities and necessary quarantine restrictions imposed. Till the contrary is proved by the non occurrence of further cases for a period of at least three weeks. The Residency Agent has been instructed to stop all passenger traffic by dhows or steamer to Bahrain. B.I. boats 1 from Karachi and Bombay already have instructions that passengers for the Gulf must have innoculation certificates. Preventive innocul&amp;tion has already begun and adequate supplies of vaccine are being sent by plane. The M.O. R.A.F. is arranging to innoculate Sharjah (uninfected at present) and the M.O. and local Doctor Dubai, medicines and saline solution etc. will be supplied by M*0. R.A.F. as required. Reports of fresh attacks will be sent through M.O.R.A.F. as they occur one to Bahrain and to Habbaniya. A regular 3 day progress report will also be sent. Containers for specimens for Bacteriological examination have been supplied to the M.O. These will be sent through R.A.F. one to Bahrain and one to Habbaniya. Shaikh Said was very cooperative and willing to help in all preventative measures but pointed out that any attempt at isolation of contacts would defeat its object /andEL' 2 « and rasult in supprassion of reporting cases* I have impressed upon the M*0« that the only effective means at our disposal of suppressing the epidemic is preven- titive innoculation and to try his best to innocul^te every inhabitant of Dubai giving each 1 c*c*j persons whom he could depend upon to take the second dose could be given the two injections* Group Captain Knight who accompanied me throughout the investigations agreed that the above Preventative measures were the maximum lie could take under the circum stances* I have the honour to be, Sir, _ % j Sgd* M.L.A* Steele (Captain) Residency Surgeon, Bahrain.D.O.

In discussion with Director of Health however it has emerged that main reason for isolation of Kuwait and Bahrain from Iraq is fear that traveller may leak through from Egypt without undergoing quarantine. Direct6r quoted an actual case of two AmericaK Oil Company employees who went to Kuwait from Egypt by air (he thinks by Middle East air lines machine), stayed there 'passed a day or two' and then flew on to Baghdad where they did not reveal that they had recently been in Egypt and stayed at a hotel in quarantine. 3.

Immediately the ^.nti-Cholera Vaccine was packed ready for despatch we contacted B.O.A.C. who informed us that they could not accept the two packages for transmission by the seaplane leaving Poole os it 'touched down' near Cairo, Egypt, and their information was that any Anti-Cholera Vaccine entering Egypt in transit for any other part of the world would be confiscated by the Egyptian Government. Under these circumstances we had no alternative but to consign the packages on the £lane for Karachi and the B.O.A.C. officials assured us that they would make special arrangements so that transference was made immediately on to the seaplane from Karachi to Bahrain, which should ensure that the packages were in your possession not later than Monday afternoon, November 17th. We hope, therefore, that by this time the vaccine has been received in satisfactory condition. Herewith are our covering invoices dated November 14th, reference 3641X, from which you will see that in view of the large quantity ordered, we were able to supply in larger containers thus reducing the price per package to 14/6d. net. We would also point out that we have supplied the new strength of 8,000 million per c.c. as there appears to be an over whelming demand for this potency despite the fact that the British Pharmacopoeia ‘gives as standard the 2,000 million strength.

Those who have received the 2,000 million strength may rest assured that complete immunity has been conferred, because until comparatively recently this was the dosage invariably given, and has proved perfectly satisfactory in conveying immunity during previous epidemics. Our only reason for changing is to bring it into line with what appears to be now the generally accepted dosage. Assuring you of our constant desire to be of service, we remain.
