M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to request that you will acquaint the Hon'ble the Political Resident, with the following facts. The provident fund of the three British Officials of the Bahrain State is at present invested in Government of India securities ap proved by the Hon’ble the Political Resident. These securities, as stated in the contracts, will be handed over to the various officials on their retire-ment from service with this Bovernment. The contributions consist of Bs 200/- per month paid to the account of each official by the Bahrain State. The total credits are now as follows.- Rs Mr. 0. D. Belgrave - 9623/- Mr. C. deGrenier -15500/- Captain L.S.Parke - 8081/- .The three British officials were not engaged from India, and as it happens not one of them has any connection with India, and it is most highly- 2 - highly improbable that then they retire they will have any wish to live in India. When they with draw their provident funds they will wish to transfer them to England and either realise them in English currency or invest them in England. We view with the gravest apprehension the likeli hood of a depreciation in the value of the rupee which would cause a decrease in the value of the investments by the time they were withdrawn. We therefore request that the funds should be transferred to British Government stock, such as war stock 1929 - f 47 on which income tax is not payable by residents abroad. I have been asked to represent this matter to you by Mr. deGrenier and Captain Parke and I am in entire agreement with their views. Although I have not approached H.E.Sfraikh Hamad on the subject, I feel confident that he would have no objection to the transfer of these funds. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Obedient Servant,2 . all months balances, and Uie bank could themselves give the month’s notice required before a withdrawal of the total sum for investment. At present, I believe no interest is paid on their balances, though they are at times considerable. * I have the honour to be, ~ Sir, Your most obedient servant, pj* Political Agent, Bahrein,cf 1930 &gt;TC . 7 ^ British Besidenoy &amp; Consulate-General Bu ire, the March 19.30.

It is therefore incorrect to say that the officers con cerned have now the option of transferring the proceeds of their Provident Funds to British Government Stock. They are in fact equally with the Bahrein State bound by the strict terms of their agreements. In the circumstances a the Government of India regret that they are unable to accept the proposal.

The Bahrein State after all is not an Indian State hut technically an independent Government and its three British employes are private individuals and not lent Government officers.If these officers and the/Bahrein Government hoth agree to modify tne terms of trie contract they would seem legally and juridicalxy entitled to do.If it was a question involving an important principle of policy e.g. the retention of Europeans in Bahrein employ or something of that sort then of course we woyid interfere on political grounds hut it seems to me that where tne employer and tne employes have agreed to modify the terms of the existing agreement on a very small matter of detail such as this it is hardly necessary for the Government of India t' intervene. As however there may he other considerations involved which 1 am not capable of appreciating locally 1 have thought it as well to write to you i demi-officially in the first instance he- j fore taking up the matter again officially. As I have already pointed out none of tue officers concerned have or have hau any connection with India ana it really does not seem to me unreasonable t#at if they want their money hanked in England instead of India their wiAhes should 4e met.Bri To No. 11$/of 1930, cnsulate-Greneral, ^ \1 »GAi &lt;V : Vr-' A L (V* us'nire, the^’Ty ^gust 1930. p jo AT The Political Agont, 3 A H R E I N.
