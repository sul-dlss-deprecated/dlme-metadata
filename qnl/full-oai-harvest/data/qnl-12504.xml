                           Severn[Captain Joseph Collier/Richard Dorrell]. The ledger appears to be for the ship's first voyage, which was from England to Batavia [Jakarta] and back, since all of the entries cover the period 1742-1744, with the exception of one entry dated January 1757, which notes a payment into the Company's Treasury.The ledger contains the accounts of pay and other financial records of each of the ship's crew members, including details of fees paid to Greenwich hospital (this was a hospital in the older sense of the word, serving as a home for retired sailors).Also included in the ledger is a piece of blotting paper (folio 58).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Severn</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Accounts ledgers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Wages</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sailors</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001399.0x00019f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
