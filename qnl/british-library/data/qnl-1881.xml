Staff Officer (intelligence) East Indies Station.Naval Headquarters, Trincomalee, Ceylon. 13th May, 1948. PERIODIC NIilWS LETTER NQ.1. THE NAVI’S TOW INC FEAT. A story of dogged endurance in the face of foul weather, of tows yawing and breaking adrift, was received from Commander H.N.A. Richardson, D.S.O., D.S.C., R.N. , Officer Commanding the towing operation known as SNOW WHITE. A.P.D. 35, the largest of four floating docks involved in the operation, has been safely left at Malta. The other three, the A.F.D. 22 and 26, both of which came from India, and the A.F.D. 46 , which joined the operation at Gibraltar, are now in Britain, 'After Malta', states Commander Richardson, in a report written during the latter part of the voyage, 'a full easterly gale blew for two days, both tows parted; the docks drifted helplessly and SNOW WHITE became scattered. Better weather had to be awaited to reconnect the tows and reform SNOW WHITE. 'The weather from Gibraltar was consistently bad but, though battered, SNOW WHITE did not lose cohesion. 'Docks towed well in the open sea but had to be nursed. Speed was frequently reduced when the limits of stress and strain in towing hawsers and docks was reached. In confined waters, especially in the Suez Canal, their behaviour was totally unpredictable. It varied with small changes of wind and many violent yav/s in the Canal brought the docks within inches of concrete pylons. Two docks went aground in the Canal, but were successfully pulled off. 'At the swinging railway bridge at El Firdan, which carried the railway connecting Egypt with Palestine, there was only 10 ft. clearance on each side for A.P.D,35. She had to be warped through foot by foot to avoid touching the bridge structure. The R.N. crews, some of whom had not previously been engaged on towage work, magnifi cently did a job which in pre-war days was contracted out to towing specialists.' Commander Richardson is no stranger to either end of a towing line. He was in command of H.M. Destroyer MARNE, which had her stern blown away during the war. She was patched up and towed by H.M. Rescue Tug EMINENT from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom a tow of 2,100 miles accomplished in weather so bad that the ships had to part company with a convoy in which they were sailing. FLOATING COLLEGE PUTS TO SEA . The battle-honoured County Class cruiser, H.M.S. DEVONSHIRE, transformed from a fighting ship into a floating college, sailed on her first training cruise with 222 cadets on board, including some from India, Eire and New Zealand, She'relieves H.M.S. FROBISHER, the Navy's former training cruiser which was not large enough to meet requirements.The cadets, who form nearly half her company, in addition to receiving instruction in navigation, ship construction and signal communications, do ordinary seamen's duties, such as scrubbing decks and manning boats, and when they become officers they will have per formed all the duties they may require ratings to do. H.ki.S. DEVONSHIRE sailed from Devonport, her home port, and after calling at a number of Scottish ports, will visit Oslo on July 8. She v/ill be reviving her old Norwegian associations, for she was the ship which brought King Haakon from Norway to England during the recent war. Completed in 1927, DEVONSHIRE was among the ships forming the covering forces for the first Russian convoy. She sank the notorious raider 'C' which had previously destroyed some 20 Allied merchantmen in the South Atlantic. Raider 'C', v/hich proved to be the armed merchant cruiser GOLDENEELS, was masquerading as vie POLYPHEMUS but her bluff was called by H.M.S. DEVONSHIRE. GRAESPEE LACKED 'OFFENSIVE SPIRIT.' The first of a series of wartime naval dispatches now to be published at frequent intervals, appeared in a supplement to the 'London Gazette' on June 19. This dispatch deals with the Battle of' tne River Plate and is written by Rear Admiral Sir Henry Harwood, K.O.B. , O.B.E., who commanded the operation which ended in the German rocket Battleship 'GRAF SPEE' being scuttled off Montevideo. Admiral Harwood who was in the' cruiser H.M.S. AJAX and. was then service as a Commodore, comments in the report;: 'GRAF SPEE turned away after the first phase and from that time her commanding officer displayed little offensive spirit. 'Her initial closing of range brought our 8-in. and 6-in. cruisers into range at once and solved our greatest problem,' The last letter of Captain Hans Langsdorff, telling why he scuttled the GRAF SPEE and then committed suicide, has also been published. Langsdorff v/rote: 'Any attempt at breaking out was bound to fail, as we had little ammunition. There was risk, too, that the ship would fall into enemy hands, I die to atone for any possible reflection on the honour of the flag.' THE GERMAN NAVY ARCHIVES. V/HEN DQNITZ HAD THE EAR OF HITLER . Two further instalments of the German naval archives captured at Tambach just before the end of the war, containing minutes of the 'Fulirer Conferences' attended by Donitz, as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, have now been published by the Admiralty,© - 3 - ; ~3 The first of these iiisto.lin.cnts is of particular intereot because it covers the closing months of the war, ^rom January 19^-5&gt; v/hen Donitz was in growing favour with Hitler. As he attended^almoso every conference that was held, and took an ever-growing share in the general direction of operations and administration of the forces, the naval minutes provid.e, in the translator's words ’'almost a day-to-day account of the closing stages of Germany's defeat.' The editor points out hov/ greatly the powers of Hitler and his advisers had deteriorated in the closing months of the war. Eighteen months earlier Hitler had been able to vie?/ the war situation as a whole, to foresee and often to avert disasters; the measures with which he met the Italian collapse, for instance, succeeded in delaying the Allies for more than a year. But by 1945&gt; neither he nor any of his followers could take a wide view at all# 'Where one would expect an acceptance of military del eat leading to plans for guerrilla warfare and for continuing the fight ^ underground,' says the editor, 'there are instead nothing but a series of tactical schemes for bolstering individual sections of the three fronts, neither related to nor co-ordinated with any general strategy... The conferences give a clear picture of Hitler and his staff, desperate in the face of a situation they could no longer control, and so harassed that they could not think beyond the immediate requirements of battle.' The impression of Hitler is that of an exhausted man, whose old energy intermittently breaks out in spasms cf rage, as on February 20, when he suggests denouncing the Geneva Convention, or on March 19? v/hen he gives his fanous order to destroy 'everything of value in the Reich that could be of immediate or future use to the enemy, Donitz himself shov/s an imperturbability bordering on insanity, steadily presenting encouraging reports and a hopeful countenance. He at least had something as a basis for those welcome contributions to the pro ceedings for as late as February 16, 1945, the number of 450 U-boats in commission, was the peak of the v/hole war. 01 these, 237 were in active operation and the number stood at 101 as late as^April 8,^less than a month before the collapse. He had some slight increase in their depredations to report, too, but often had to explain why those were not greater. Meanwhile his activities were varied. He constantly assured the Fuhrer that his new U-boats - ever on the point of being passed into service - V—weapons and other developments might at any moment turn the scale in Germany's favour. Even as late as March, he _had a ^ long discussion with Hitler on what should be the composition of the German navy after the war. It is clear that he had eventually become Hitler's principal military adviser, the only one v/hose loyalty seemed to remain unshaken. HISTORICAL FACTS IH NAZI DOCUMENTS . The second instalment of the translated protocols ox Hitler s conferences with his naval commanders, covering the year 1942, was published by the Admiralty on June 8. Like the volume for 1943, published three weeks earlier, it contained facwS of the highest historical interest* Two German decisions which were hitherto unknown, are revealed for the first time in this publication.k The first is that Hitler all through the year 1942 firmly expected an Allied invasion of Norway and invested an extraordinary effort in the reinforcement of the G-erman defences there. He declared his conviction that Norway was 'the zone of destiny in this war,' and feared 'grave consequences for the entire course of the war' from unfavourable developments in that area. Hence, very strong German forces and supplies were bottled up in a theatre of war where actually nothing further ever happened. The German surface fleet, especially, was almost completely stationed in Norwegian waters; the dash of the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau through the channel ('operation Cerberus') also served this defensive concentration in Norway, At one time Hitler even planned to switch Fie Id-liar shal Kesselring to Norway as Commander-in-Chief, In connection v/ith this reinforcement of Norway, the 'still very considerable commitments of personnel and material for operation Sea Lion' (the invasion of Britain) were also finally cancelled on February 13, 1942. The other, even more fateful,trick which Hitler’s intuition played him, concerns Malta. In the war council with Mussolini at the end of April 1942, it was agreed to attack first in Libya at the end of May or the beginning of June, then to conquer Malta in mid-July, and only after that to mount the final offensive on Cairo and Suez. ^ The Malta operation, the supreme importance of which was always insisted^on by the German Navy, was planned on a grand scale, and was to be carried out mainly by German, not Italian forces. The German Navy had to effect the strongest possible concentration of landing craft even at the risk of exposing the Aegean and the Black Sea; a parachute division with three reinforced parachute regiments, assault pioneers, and an armoured unit equipped with captured super-heavy Russian 52-ton tanks were detailed for this attack. At the beginning of July, however. Hitler, over-impressed with Rommel’s successes in Libya, suddenly post poned the Malta operation, without reference to either the Italians or his own naval staff, till after 'the conquest of Egypt' was completed, and switched supplies earmarked for the Malta offensive to Rommel instead. The consequences were momentous. While Rommel was held at El Alamein, the siege of Malta was broken by the epic convoy action of early August. Though only five of 15 ships got through that was enough to re-establish Malta as an operational base for submarines, cruisers^ and aircraft which resumed the attack against Rommel's sea communications and lay the foundations of the counter-offensive at El Alamein which finally led to the annihilation of all Axis forces in Africa. It is clear that the summer of 1942 was, in fact, the supreme crisis of the war - not only on the Russian front but equally in the Mediterranean and on the oceans. Allied resources were strained to the utmost, American production was only just getting into its stride, and the U-boats were at the height of their success. From the German point of view final victory over Russia was confidently expected, and the prospect appeared as one of long—drawn—out sea war, in which the great continental Lebenstraum was to be consolidated and defended against possible landing attempts on its peninsular extremities, while the main offensive effort was to be concentrated on wearing clown Allied strength on the seas and oceans. Even at the end of the year Hitler and his advisers did not yet realise that this conception had been decisively defeated at Stalingrad, Malta and El Alamein.v &gt; &gt; a &lt;i - 5 - CiiPTUHED GERl'.iM DOGIlvIENTS REVE/iJL EXTENT OP 1944 REVOLT, The third volume of captured German naval documents covering the year 1944, published by the Admiralty on July 20th, 1947, concerns the revolt of July 20th, 1944. The new publication establishes three facts (i) There was not only an isolated attempt on Hitler's life - the only fact known at the time - but a fully-fledged revolt with a broad scop r \; it was, e.3*, completely successful in Paris, -/here the entire Gestapo was still under arrest during the night from July 20th to 21st, at a time when the action in Berlin had already been crushed, (ii) The preparation for the revolt went back in time to the year 1938, and though some general's joined it only in later stages from opportunist motives, its original leaders were 'genuinely determined not only to rescue Germany from the destruction of war, but also to rid themselves for ever of those elements within their nation which had made Mas ism possible,' (iii) An indication of its extent is given by the fact that 'according to one source, based on names and places, more than 4,980 Germans were exterminated by the Nazis in the purge which followed July 20th,' The documents contain an extract from the war diary of the German Admiral Commanding Group West, which shows the complete con fusion into which the German Command in the West mas thrown for more than 24 hours, through this attempt to assassinat Hitler, overthrow Nazism, and terminate the war. Apart from this dramatic episode, the volume is less rich in revelations than its predecessors. In 1944 the naval war v/as clearly lost for Germany, and its history is a dismal chronicle of ever more desperate makeshifts of foredoomed hopes pinned on secondary new gadgets, of shrinking bases and resources, and - more and more - of a fight for existence loss against the Allies than against the German Army, which tried to use the Navy's personnel to replace its own mounting losses. Remarkable in all this is Admiral Doenits’s stubborn refusal to admit defeat; even in December, 1944, with all his Atlantic bases gone, his first-line U-boats reduced from 181 tn June to 140, and his reserve from 290 to 65 , he ordered a new U-boat offensive in the Bristol Channel, the Irish Sea, the Minchos, and off the North-East coast of England, where U-boat-' 1 , had not ventured since 1940,D.O.No,0/1-30 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 26th May, 1948 / Dear Buffer, I thank you for your letter No.645/29/F, dated the 13th May, 1948, and welcome you to the area.

PERIODIC NEWS 1ETTER NO. 2. ACTIVITIES OP THE ADMIRALTY SHIPY/ELDINC COMvUTPEE . British Shipbuilders have for some time been aware that for various reasons welding will become increasingly necessary and that the day may not be far distant when it will completely dis place riveting in the building of ships. A significant number of all welded ships has been or is being built in Britain and to explain what is being done in this sphere of shipbuilding science, a press conference was held at the Admiralty in August. A great step forward was taken during the late war when the .Americans used welding almost exclusively in the construction of their enormous emergency war programme, but this complete break with old-established practice has, not unnaturally, been attended lay some failures, and these in turn have directed the attention of Naval Architects to the problems of why they occurred and how their recurrence can be avoided. It is evident that the problem which faced the U.S.A. faces Britain too, and this was realised in 1943 when the Admiralty set up a Ship Welding Committee to investigate the problems arising from the employment of welding in ships structures and to advise on methods of their solution. Research is now being centred round two cargo ships 'Clan Alphine' and 'Ocean Vulcan'. These tv/o steamers are almost identical in design but with the significant difference that whereas the former is almost wholly riveted, the latter is almost entirely welded. The aim of the experiments is to establish the fundamental differences, if any, between riveted and welded con struction, and at the same time to test out conventional theories of stress behaviour of hull structures on actual specimen ships. This latter aspect has never before been approached with such completeness as in the present experiments. The 'Ocean Vulcan' has been trading across the North Atlantic during the past 15 months. During this time a party of investigators has, with the aid of the most up-to-date instruments, taken a complete record of all the various forces which the sea can impose on the ships structure, in all sorts of weather. Some idea of the magnitude of the task can be gathered from the fact that nearly 1,000 instruments were installed, most of which were wired up to a central recording panel, which was photographed at -4 second intervals by means of a cine-camera. During the periods when records were being taken 850 readings were simultaneously photographed by each frame of the film, or 1,700 readings per second.0 d - 2 - While these sea-trials of the 'Ocean Vulcan' have been going on, her half-sister, the 'Clan Alpine', was subjected to a series of bending tests in still water, to establish the relation between the external forces and their effect on the structure. This has been done by flooding holds with water and measuring the strains produced on the hull. A whole cycle of varying bending forces has been imposed and it is hoped that this cycle will cover the actual conditions as measured at sea, so that the corresponding strains likely to be met at sea can be deduced. In these trials the ship has sometimes given a heavy list, to simulate rolling, and sometimes a heavy trim, to simulate these attitudes in a seaway. Nearly 100,000 instrument readings have been made, and the gauges used are so delicate that strains of one-millionth of an inch per inch hove been measured. The 'Ocean Vulcan' has completed her term of experiments at sea, and is now being prepared to undergo a repetition of the still water experiments which were carried out on the 'Clan Alpine.' A positive comparison of the effects of external forces on the two methods of construction will therefore be afforded. The quantity of data from both sea and still water eixperiments is astronomical, and it may be years before a full analysis can be completed. Enough has been found, however, in a preliminary survey of the results to indicate that many new and hitherto unsuspected facts will emerge from these epoch-making experiments. Concurrently with these investigations on actual ships, scientific work under laboratory conditions has been carried out at Cambridge University and elsewhere to find out whether the 'locked up stresses' known to be caused by welding were harmful, and also to discover whether welding has any harmful effects on the steel. So far the investigations have given negative ansv/ers to both these questions, and it has been found that some steels, under certain combinations of low temperature and stress, are liable to fracture in a brittle manner. Fortunately these conditions^ and these particular steels, are uncommon, but never theless steps are being taken to guard against their occurrence. 154 SHU'S SCRAPPED. The number of ships of the Royal Navy for which approval to be scrapped has beua granted since the end of the war totals no fewer than 154; says a correspondent of Lloyds Shipping List; all these ships have been handed over to the British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation (Salvage) Limited. They include two battleships, the WARSPITE and the IRON DUKE, the Aircraft Carrier ARCUS, nine Cruisers, the VINDICTIVE, ENTERPRISE, DAUNTLESS, DESPATCH, DIOMEDE, CARAD0C, CAPETOWN, CARDIFF and CERES. Also to be scrapped are the two Monitors EREBUS and MARSHAL SCULT, the large Cruiser Minelayer ADVENTURE, 73 destroyers, 30 submarines, 5 sloops, 17 corvettes, 2 frigates, 7 mine-sweepers and 5 large depot and parent ships.1 * - 3 - HOYAL MAVY D EVELOPS GAS TURBPE CRAFT . The first craft to be powered by a gas turbine has been taken to sea by the Royal Navy and the prelminary experiments are proceeding, For a number of years leading engineering nations have been interested in the development and marine application of the gas turbine, an engine using oil fuel but in which the motion is entirely rotary. This obviates the vibration and certain other inherent disadvantages of the 'push pull' motion of the conventional reciprocating internal combustion engine. Thus the engine combines the advantages of the smooth running steam turbine with economy in weight and space. The gas turbine now under trial has been developed for the Admiralty by the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company Ltd., of Trafford Park, Manchester, and has been installed in H.M. Motor Gun Boat 2009, a 110 foot triple screw craft built by Messrs. Camper Nicholson of Southampton. It drives the control shaft of the craft and takes the place of one of the three 1250 B.H.P. petrol engines which formerly powered her. It comprises an axial flow compressor, v/hich supplies air under pressure to the combustion chamber. Diesel fuel is burned here and the hot gases so formed are expanded through a 2-stage turbine, which drives the compressor, and finally through a 4-stage turbine which is coupled to the propellor shaft through gears. The output of the turbine has been nominally rated at 2,500 shaft horse jjower. 'It must be emphasised that M.G.B. 2009 is not jet propelled,' states one of the Naval Engineer Officers responsible for the experiments, 'The power from the jet is converted into rotary motion so as to drive a shaft and propellor of a conventional kind. 'Jet propulsion as such is not considered efficient for ships and craft with good sea going qualities and capable of carrying axmament, A jet propelled hydroplane, while of interest to record breakers, has neither the speed nor reconnaissance abilities of an aeroplane nor the advantages of an ocean going vessel, which can stay at sea and strike suddenly from the surface,' 'The M.G.B. 2009 installation is essentially an experi mental one, designed to give practical experience in this new field of marine propulsion. It will not create speed records. The gas turbine power unit does, however, produce a remarkable power for the space and weight devoted to it and it augurs well for the future of gas turbine propulsion. It may well bring about a revolution in the performance of the smaller fighting ships.' During the war years a great deal of work bearing on the subject was carried out to make possible jet propelled aircraft and some of the components developed for this purpose have been used in the installation in M.G.B, 2009* By this means Britain has acquired the lead in the practica l, application of the gas turbine for marine purposes.The Admiralty is already planning larger gas turbine machinery for installation in a vessel of the escort type. This further project has been designed as a marine propulsion unit from the start and it is predicted that its durability and efficiency will be greater than those of the engine now under trial. battleships in the atomic age. A near future when the main armament of the battleship will be guided missiles as a counter to atom bombers is envisaged in 'Jane’s Fighting Ships^ 1946-7/' n °w published by Sampson Low, Marston and Go., Ltd, (P3.3s.). 'There is no doubt that the temporary suspension of work on the United States’ battleships, the KENTUCKY and the HAWAII, may be ascribed to the intention to incorporate rockets in their armaments,' it is claimed by 'Jane,' 'In a year or two, therefore, the rocket will have graduated as the main weapon of the capital shijo, amounting to nothing less than a revolution in naval ordnance,, Moreover, from official utterances, it would seem that the United States Navy looks to guided missiles of exceptional accuracy and range to counter attacks by aircraft carrying atom bombs,' 'In the opinion of the Admiralty', continues 'Jane' the implications of atomic energy in the long view of the situation are by no means limited to defensive asjjects, and may lead to an enhancement of naval pov/er in a highly modified form and with wide offensive and defensive commitments. The atomically propelled warship would have no immediate refuelling problems, and the period for which she could stay at sea would be limited only by other and generally less urgent problems, a vital factor if the ship proved less vulnerable than the harbour,' 'Jane' adds that there is plenty of support for the aircraft carrier as the capital ship of the future. THE USE OF ASDICS IN WHALING- . The location of whales and shoals of fish are among the suggested commercial uses of Asdic, one of the Royal Navy's methods of detecting enemy submarines. The principle employed is that supersonic waves, sent out through the water,'echo when they strike a solid object. The following are extracts from a report by Mr. W.J, McCarthy, of K.M. Underwater detection Establishment, Portland, who assisted in the experiments at sea :- At the end of the war a number of pre-war asdic sets were provided for fitting in whalecatchers, so that the possible benefits of asdics might be assessed. Asdic sets were fitted in two whale-catchers - SOUTHERN WILCOX and SOUTHERN WHEELER - then building at South Bank, Middlesbrough. These ships sailed for the Antarctic at the end of 1945 to join the remainder of the whaling fleet in the South Georgia area. A scientific officer from H.M.A*/S. Experimental Establishment, Fairlie, was embarked in SOUTHERN WILCOX to carry out trials.i 1 5 i ? 4-| The asdic equipment fitted for trial consisted of a standard housing dome and the electrical components of two sets - Type 123A. (trawler type), with a few modifications, and Type 136 (merchant ship type ) 0 In the former the transmitting circuit derives its pov\/er from a H,F, mo tor-alternator; the amplifier is hattery-driven. In the latter a valve oscillator supplies the transmitting circuit; the amplifier is an A.V.C. receiver driven from a 50 c/s supply. The normal Type 123A oscillator training system (flexible shafting) was replaced by an electrical system; oscillator bearings were shown in the normal manner by a line of light on a magnetic compass. In Type 136 the standard training control gave relative bearings only, there being no gyro compass on board. The two outfits used a common chemical recorder. Under the best conditions whales were detected at 2,200 yards aurally and 1,200 yards by recorder. It was possible to hold contact, using short transmissions, down to 60 yards. It was found that a swimming whale produces no hydro phone effect (audible sound) in the asdic receiver, and leaves no detectable trace of true wake. This is due to its perfect stream lining and method of propulsion. Undisturbed whales were occasionally heard to emit whistling noises, but these were of no value for listening detection. It became apparent early in the season that when whales were over 800 yards from the catcher no assistance in detection was necessary. At this range they were undisturbed by noise from the catcher, and their frequent blowing gave enough visual indication of their course, a few points alteration to the ship's head being sufficient to close them. Under 800 yards, however, aids in following submerged whales could be of very great benefit. A whale when being chased, i.e, stern on, presents a bad surface for reflection, and con sequently gives faint echoes; nevertheless asdic contact could be held from 80 down to 60 yards, chiefly because of the marked doppler effect which provided the only means of distinguishing the whale from other targets such as ice and 'blow-wakes.' * The report concludes: The investigation has shewn that the existing equipment which it is permissible to use for commercial purposes, while being of some assistance in the catching of whales, does not justify the expense of fitting and maintenance. It fails to give assistance at a particularly vital period, when the catcher is very close to a submerged whale and it is essential to forecast with reasonable accuracy the position in which it will surface. On the other hand, an asdic set which will perfonn the necessary functions is not impossible of construction. The design of such a set would present a task of considerable interest.1 6 - SINKING OP IHE BISMARCK, A second dispatch of considerable interest was also published during October, the story of the destruction of the ’’unsinlcable' BISMARCK in the Atlantic on May 27, 1941, ns told by Admiral Sir John Tovey, Commander-in-chief, Home Fleet, at that time* Shortage of fuel in our battleships, it is revealed, almost enabled the enemy to escarp, and the loss of H.M.S, HOOD and damage to the PRINCE OP WADES had left the KING GEORGE V as the only effective battleship in Home Waters. Of the enemy, Sir John states: 'The BISMARCK had put up a most gallant fight against impossible odds, worthy of the old days of the Imperial German Navy and she went down with her colours still flying,' The official description of BISMARCK' s last few minutes states: 'In order to increase the rate of hitting, the battle- ships continued to close the range, eventually coming down to 3,300 yards. By 10*15 the BISMARCK was a wreck, without a gun firing, on fire fore and aft and wallowing more heavily every moment. Men could be seen jumping overboard, preferring death by drowning in the stormy seas to the appalling effects of our fire.' The dispatch reveals that it was a reconnaissance air craft dispatched on the personal initiative of the commanding officer of the R,N, /dr Station, Hatston (Capt, H.L* St. J, Pancourt), and flying almost at surface level over the fiords, that finally established that BISMARCK and a Hipper class cruiser had left Bergen, The PRINCE OP WAKES, reports Sir John, started off well for a new and unpractised ship but she had 'teething troubles' which affected her gunnery. Her bridge was seriously damaged, she had taken in 400 tons of water aft end could not exceed 27 knots. SINKING OP THE BISMA RCK GERMAN VERSION , The last instalment of the records of 'Fuhrer Conferences' , from the German naval archives captured by British and American officers at Tambach in the closing stages of the war, was issued by the Admiralty on October 26th. It covers the records for the year 1941, and the chief interest in the volume is not so much the 'Fuhrer Conferences' themselves as the account, translated from the German Naval 'War Diary, of the cruise and destruction of the BISMARCK in May of that year. The British dispatches from Admiral Tovey were published on October 16th, and it is interesting to compare the two versions, both composed at the time, one with the other. The nine Swordfish aircraft of the VICTORIOUS, for instance, which made a gallant torpedo attack on the German ship at sunset in bad weather at the extreme limit of their range, and all succeeded in regaining their carrier, v/ere multiplied in the German report into 27 aircraft, of which five were shot down. / Wm»iKG:--»3£e v .:The German account remarks on the excellence of the British radar equipment, which made it almost impossible for the BISMARCK to shake off the British cruisers. After her disastrous end, Hitler at his next naval conference asked why, when she had sunk the HOOD and damaged the PRINCE OP WADES, she did not turn on the latter and finish her off, even if it did mean her own destruction by the British forces that would gather once she was located, Raeder had no little difficulty in finding a satis factory answer. Another interesting aspect of the Naval war is revealed in the document. It is disclosed that Admiral Darlan, the French wartime Navy Chief and politician, offered to give the Germans information he possessed about British Fleet dispositions. So valuable was this information that Grand Admiral Raeder had a teleprinter line laid between Parian's office in Vichy and the German headquarters in Paris. Darlan made his offer in December, 1941, and he criticised the British Navy as 'suffering from a lack of personalities and a lack of responsibility among the leading officers,' As soon as Parian*s perfidious offer reached Berlin the wires from Hitler's Chancellery grew hot, A certain dinner party in Paris was arranged.,, Darlan was guest of honour. With him was Madame Darlan and among other guests was Admiral Cchultze, appointed as contact-man by Raeder. After dinner Darlan was very open, nearly comradely. 'Based, on his co-operation with the British Admiralty', he said., 'he had a very well-informed intelligence service, and was in a position to supply the German Naval War Staff with valuable information on British ship movements and intentions.' WHY NAZIS DID NOT INVADE BRITAIN . ARCHIVES .SHOW THE ilPQRTAHCB OF SEA POWER . The sixth instalment of the German Naval archives recording Hitler's conferences with his Service Commanders, now issued by the Admiralty, deals, among other things, with the 1940 plans for the invasion of Britain. It is illuminating to learn from the document how ignorant Hitler and his army and air staffs were of the difficulties involved in an oversea operation. The naval staff, however, was under no illusions, Raeder had ordered it, on November 15th, 1939, to investigate the problem of an invasion across the Channel and to prepare plans because he foresaw that Hitler might at any tine order an invasion at short notice. On July 2nd Hitler issued the order Raeder had foreseen - that the services should forthwith prepare a plan for invasion which, though no date was mentioned, he obviously contemplated putting into operation soon. It v/as to be known by the code name 'Sealion'.8 »u Then began a series of controversies, vacillations, and changes of intention. The matter vvas raised at a conference on July 11th, when Raeder expressed the view that invasion should only be undertaken as a last resort. He was convinced that Britain could be forced to sue for peace by cutting off her sea borne supplies - by U-boats, chiefly, but supported by all other available agencies, air and surface warships alike - and by air atfcacds on her ports. He could not, he said, advise invasion as he had in the case of Norway, Prerequisites in this case were complete air superiority and clearance of mines from a large area, and that area would have to bo enclosed by protective German minefields on the flanks. ^ ^ Hitler agreed, and stated that he accepted the necessity for air superiority and regarded invasion only as a last resortj but he veered completely round in a very few days. On July 15th the naval staff was informed by the O.K.'J. (Supreme Command) that liiuler required the operation to be prepared forthwith for execution ‘-‘■t nny time from August 15bh onwards, and the next day Hi‘ ier*s own directive was issued, JES IGNORED - This directive clearly convinced Raeder that the Puhrer and the O.K.W. had no understanding of the naval problems involved. Three days later he sent to the latter a long memorandum pointing^ out the difficulties which seemed to have been ignored. Embarkation facilities in the designated area had been extensively damaged by the fighting in Prance; transports would have to traverse an area in v/hich weather, fog, tidestreams, and -well might present the greatest difficulties; British harbours being strongly defended, the landing would have to be made on the open coast where these difficulties v/ould be intensified; mine- clearance might well prove a formidable task, and protective mine fields could be reinforced by the enemy up to the last moment. Most serious of all, the British fleet seemed to have been ignored, though it would undoubtedly be thrown in if a landing were undertaken, and it could not be safely assumed that the Luftwaffe could prevent its reaching the vital area. Raeder followed up this memorandum by a report to Hitler two days later at a conference, in which he also emphasized the necessity for carrying through the operation, if at all, before the autumn fogs jjrevented full collaboration of the Luftwaffe, The next day che O.K, V/, reached the conclusion, and reported it to Hitler, that preparations could not be completed by August 15th. A few days later the army fixed its requirements at a first wave of 100,000 men, with their heavy gear, to be followed immediately by further waves in as quick succession as transport could be turned round, and the craft needed for this force was worked out at 1,72&lt;d barges, M71 tugs, 1,161 motor-boats, and 155 troopships. Preparations then began in earnest, but discussions between amy and navy were acrimonious. The army wanted to land on a wide front, extending from Ramsgate to Lyne Bay, which the n.:Vy regarded as impracticable. The controversy raged for weeks, but by the end of August a compromise was reached, pour main landings were to be made, three between Folkestone and Beachy Head and the other between Brighton and Selsey Bill; two points, by cruisers and emp^y transports, were to be made towards Iceland ana the north-east coast of Britain; and the pocket battleship SCHSER was to make a commerce-raiding cruise in the Atlantic to draw off a part of the Home Fleet. A time-table was drawn up providing for the executive order to be given on D minus 10 day,troops to embark on D minus 3&gt; designating D minus 1 as the last day on which the operation could be called off. On September 3rd it was decided that September 21st would be the earliest possible date for D day; and as Raeder had already reported that moon and tide would be favourable only between September 19th and 26 th, the probability of 'Sealion' being carried out at all was clearly narrowing. GIBRALTAR INVASION CONSIDERED - On September 6th Raeder urged the importance of excluding Britain from the Mediterranean by the occupation of Gibraltar and Suez, and Hitler ordered plans for the former to be put in hand. Raeder also urged the occupation of Dakar, but Hitler seemed to prefer the project of the Luftwaffe’s seizing one of the Canary Islands. Meanwhile, the air bombardment preliminary to 'Sealion' went on. On September 14-th, however, Hitler, on Raeder’s advice, announced that it was not practicable to attempt the invasion in the September period; he was not going to cancel it yet and might still order it'during October. It was not until October 12th that it was definitely postponed to the following spring, and by that time some 12y per cent of the barges and transports assembled in the Channel ports had been destroyed. preparations were not to be manifestly cancelled for 'the British must continue to believe that we are preparing an attack on a broad front,' said Hitler, but by the spring of 1941 Hitler and his staff were so deeply involved in preparing to attack Russia that 'Sealion' plans were never revived. Consideration of alternatives to 'Sealion' were taken up as soon as it was definitely off. On November 4th Hitler announced at a conference that he had determined to occupy Gibraltar as soon as possible, and 50 officers, as a reconnaissance unit, were to be sent to Spain forthwith. Of that conference Raeder recorded that he would 'have to talk to the Puhrer at some length, since he is apparently very much in favour of occupying the Cape Verde Islands.' On December 18 th Hitler ordered preparations for 'Operation Barbarossa' against Russia, and even 'Operation Felix' against Gibraltar was postponed. There was also a proposal for the invasion of Eire which never materialised. THE JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL. ’A Jewish State in Palestine, to be called 'Israel'’ was proclaimed in the afternoon of 14th May, 1948, by the Jewish National Council of Palestine. The proclamation, broadcast at 1600, eight hours before the British Mandate officially ended, said that the decision had been made ’by virtue of the natural and historic right of the Jewish people and by resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations’ - that is, the decision in favour of Partition on 29th November last. The new State will be ’open to all Jewish immigrants’, though offering 'full social and political equality for all its citizens without distinction of race, creed or sex’. The State will be based on ’the precepts of liberty, justice and peace taught by the Hebrew prophets’.10 Gt-overmient . A constitution for the new State will be drawn up by a Constituent Assembly not later than 1st October, 194-8. Until then, the existing National Council will act as the provisional Government. The new Government includes the following. Their political affiliations are shown in brackets President Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Foreign Affairs.

Rosenbluth (Aliya Chadasha) Rabbi J.L, Fishman (Mizrachi) Rabbi l.M. Levin (Agudah Israel). Po liti cal_ O rganisation . Jews living in Palestine are collectively known as the Yishuv when it is intended to distinguish them as a body from the Diaspora, or Jews living outside the country. The Jewish Community in Palestine (Knesseth Israel) elects every four years a 'Parliament' known as the Elected Assembly (Assifath HaNivcharim), which in turn elects annually a National Council (Vaad Leumi). This is the body which has declared the State of Israel. It has previously been responsible for the supervision of local communities and their various committees in towns, villages and settlements. Almost equally important is the Histadruth (Histadruth Haklalit Shel Haovdim Haivriim: General Federation of Jewish Labourers). Technically a trade union, it also controls insurance and building societies, and the Labour and Left YRLng parties are affiliated to it. During the Mandate the Jewish Community of Palestine has been represented in its dealing v/ith the Mandatory by the Jewish Af 'ncy, a body including both Zionists and non-Zionists. The Agency, the Assembly and Council and the Histadruth, though in theory independent of each other, are in fact closely linked in membership and policy, and on all important issues speak with or „ voice. The last elections for the Elected Assembly were held in Augi st, 1944. They were boycotted by the Revisionists and General Zionists (see paragraph 8 ) and the party composition resulted as follows :-11 Party Votes Seats Mapai 73,66? 63 Left Front (Hashomer Hatzair and Poalei Zion) 24,775 21 Aliya Chadasha 27,383 18 Hapoel HaMizrachi 19,372 18 Achdut Avoda 18,168 16 Mizrachi 7,772 7 Communists 3,943 3 Others 34,365 26 202,^48 171 political Parties. The main Jewish political parties are as follows. Votes cast for them in Palestine elections to the 22nd World Zionist Congress (October 194^) are given in brackets :~ (a) ZIONIST. Right Wing , (i) Revisionists (Brith Hazionim Harevisionistim: Joint Union of Zionists-Revisionists) c Founded by the late Vladimir Jabotinsky; aims at Jewish State in the whole of Palestine and Trans jordan, Has been associated with both Irgun and Stern Gang, Lost influence before and during the war, but has lately become the second largest Zionist Party. (27,000). ( i1 -^ M izrachi (Spiritual Centre) Federation (Histadrut HaMizrachi) Aims for a Jewish State founded on observance of the religious law (Torah) and the Sabbath. Deplores Left-Wing secularism. Middle-class in composition. Leader: Rabbi J.L. Fishman, (5,000). (iii) M izrachi Workers 1 Federation (Histadrut Hapoel HaMizrachi) Policy as for (ii).

Cen tre . , iv) Genera l Zi onists (Histadrut Hazionim Haklaliun) Formerly led by Dr. Vfeizmann, Aims at political reconciliation within the Yishuv. Not Socialist, but collaborates with the Mapai on Zionist questions. Has tended to give priority to immigration over creation of a State. (A small right-wing group aims at promoting private enter prise and capitalism). Leaders: Mr. J. Gruehbaum and Mr. F. Bernstein. (8,000).—^ v ) Aliya Chadasha (Ne-w Settlers) Consists mainly of recent inmigrants from Central Europe. Stands for moderation - in economics between socialism and capitalism, and in foreign affairs in relations with British and Arabs, but has demanded free immigration. Leader: Dr. F. Rosenbluth. ( 13 , 000 ). Left Y/in^ . (vi) Mapai (Mifleget Poalei: Labour Party) Affiliated to Histadruth, in which its members have an absolute majority (54/o) over other Labour; parties w Is the largest party in the Yishuv, dominating Jewish politics. Moderate Socialist, with evolutionary rather than revolutionary methods. It aims at establishing a Jewish Community by immigration and settlement. Support comes mainly from the urban proletariat. Leaders: Mr. D. Ben Cur ion, Mr. M. Shertok, Mr. E. Kaplan, Mrs. C. Meyerson, Mr. D. Remez. (70,000). ( vii ) United Workers { Party (Mifleget Hapoalhn Hameuchedet) Pounded in January, 1948, by the merger of Hashomer Hatzair, Achdut Avoda (Labour Unity) and Poalei Zion (Workers of Zion), which latter joined Hashomer Hatzair for the 1944 Assembly elections and Achdut Avoda for the 194^ Zionist Congress elections. The Party's main support comes from agricultural collective settlements, with some following among urban workers. More radical than Mapai, it is also more inclined to look for help from the East, and one of its leaders, Mr. Moshe Sneh, resigned from the Jewish Agency Executive because of its pro-West orientation. Leaders: Mr. I. Tabenkin, Mr. M. Yaari, Mr. M. Sneh. (Hashomer Hatzair - 24,000; Achdut Avoda and Poalei Zion - 25,000). (b) NON-ZIONIST. (i) Agudath Israel (Union of Israel) Orthodox Jews who (unlike the Mizrachi Parties) do not accept Zionism. They favour mass immi gration but want a Jewish Commonwealth founded on a strictly religious basis. They oppose the Jewish Agency T s view that religion is a private matter. Numbers unknown, and estimates vary from 7,000 to 50 , 000 .(ii) Palestine Communist Party , Has had more vicissitudes than ary other party. Included 'both Jews and Arabs until the Comintern was dissolved in 194-3j when an Arab Communist Party was formed. Supported the White Paper of 1939 until recently, and dropped this policy in favour of free Jewish Immigration in return for affiliation to the Histadruth. Supported a bi-national State for Palestine until Russia's vote for Partition, which policy the Party has now accepted. Leaders: Mr. Samuel Mikunis, Mrs. Esther Wilenska and Mr. Meir Vilner. Present numbers unknown; polled 4,000 in the 1944- Assembly elections, but has probably increased considerably. Popu la tion and Area . The total population of Palestine was estimated in 194^ as 1,843,000 of which Arabs numbered 1,222,000 (including 143&gt;000 Christians) and Jews 608,000. A J ewish Agency estimate for 1947 gave the Jews as 625,000* The Jewish State proposed by the United Nations was to have an area of 5,500 square miles, out of a total of 10,000 for Palestine as a whole, and a population of 905,000c (1946 estimates used as a basis). The Jews in the Jewish State would number 498,000; of the remaining Jews 10,000 would be in the Arab State and 100,000 in Jerusalem. A rmed Fo rces. 10. (a) Hagana (Irgun Hagana: Defence Organisation) Founded in 1923 to defend Jewish settlements against possible Arab attacks. Captain (later Major-General) Orde Wingate was associated with it during the Arab Revolt of 1936-39. Hagana claims as members 60^ of the 30,000 Palestinian Jews who joined tPe British forces during the war. Its present numbers total about 80,000, of whom the majority are not mobile and would be engaged in territorial defence. The mobile section of Hagana, Palmach (plugat Machatz: Striking Force), is trained in commando methods. It contains at any one time about 5,000 men and v/omen, but could probably mobilise 20,000 in emergency. All Jewish youths are expected to serve a term of military service in Palmach. Founded about 1942, Palmach is the offensive arm of Hagana, Training is intended to secure a force ready for action anywhere in Palestine, and to provide trained officers and instructors for the Hagana. During the war another branch, Palyam (plugat Yam: Maritime Force), was formed for facilitating illegal immigration, underwater sabotage and the illegal acquisition of arms and ammunition by sea routes.■mV14 M* (Id) Irpcun Zvai Leuuni (National Military Organisation). Nmbers between 4*000 and 6,000 well trained in sobotage tactics. Supports the principles of the Revisionists and adopts terrorist methods. Has at present an agreement with Hagana but maintains its indep e ndence. (c) Stern G-roup (Lochamei Herat Israel: Fighters for the Freedom of Israel). Named from its founder; consists of a few hundred terrorists specialising in political assassinations.\ ,-lv f / f / 74 .'

In the House of Commons on November 19th a question concerning naval prize money was asked by Mr. Skinnard, the Labour Member for East Harrow. He enquired of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty (Mr. John Du'gdale) whether he had yet^ received in a common form returns from all Empire prize courts; and whether he could now give an estimate of the amount of prize money available, and when grants could be made. Mr. Dugdale made the following reply: 'No, Sir. Complete returns have not yet been received and cannot be expected for some time in view of the complexity of the position in some Dominions. Until the returns have been received in a final form it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the amount of prize money available. For the same reason I am unable to make’ any forecast of when the grants can be made. Approval has been given, however, to the inclusion of a Prize Bill among the Bills which it is hoped will be talien later in this session.' RUSSIA AND H.M.S. ROYAL SOVEREIGN . Sir Ronald Ross also asked what arrangements had been made by the Soviet Coverrment for the return of H.M.S. ROYAL SOVEREIGN and U.S.S. MILWAUKEE under the terms on which they were lent. Mr. Dugdale said the naval protocol to the Italian Peace Treaty signed on February 10, 1947., laid down that the return of these two and other British ships should, as far as possible, be effected simultaneously with the transfer of the excess units of the Italian fleet allocated to Russia. Arrangements for the transfer were being considered by a four-Power Naval Commission. Mr. A.R.W. Low asked the Minister of Defence (Mr. A.V. Alexander) what would be the strength of each service on March 31st, 1948. Mr. Alexander replied that the position remains as stated by him on October 23rd when he said that the revised estimate of the strength of the Forces on 31st March next was 147,000 for the Royal Navy; 527,000 for the Army and 263,000 for the R.A.F.Brigadier H,R. Mackeson (Conservative Hythe) asked what cuts were anticipated in the Malta Dockyard; what steps would be taken to keep discharges as low as possible; and if it was the intention of the Government to allocate merchant ships to Malta for repair. Mr. W.J. Edwards (Civil Lord of the Admiralty) replied that the future industrial strength of Malta Dockyard had not yet been settled. The policy of the Admiralty was to keep discharges to the minimum when undertaking as much alternative work as possible. Control by licence of repairs to merchant ships was confined to the United Kingdom, but Malta Dockyard had authority to accede to requests to undertake repairs to merchant ships provided capacity was available. FAREUELL TO 'OLD ERIBLDS 11 „ The news that Britain is to dispose of five Capital ships - the battleships QUEEN ELIZABETH, VALIANT, NELSON and RODNEY and the battle-cruiser RENOWN - has been received with feelings of regret in Naval circles in all parts of the Y/orld. As the First Lord of the Admiralty (Viscount Hall) said when he made the announcement at a Press conference in the Admiralty on January 21st, 'the ships whose scrapping the Admiralty is announc ing are real old friends in every sense of the word. They are the friends of every officer and man in the Royal Navy and those who, like myself, have close associations -with the Service.' The First Lord continued 'These are grand old ships which have a record of service that will stand comparison with that of any ships which have belonged to the Royal Navy since its earliest days, but ships, like human beings&gt; grow old. In my early days at the Admiralty we talked of twenty years as the normal life of a battleship or battle cruiser. Not one of these ships has been less than twenty 3 ^ears in commission, and the QUEEN ELIZABETH and two others have no less than about thirty-three years of service to their credit, thirty- three years which, be it noted, include something like ten years of war service which we used to reckon, and I think we can still reckon, to be at least twice as wearing as years of peace. These ships have been battered about a good deal; they have stood the stress of war; and that they have retained their vitality until such a ripe old age is a wonderful testimony to the work of those who built them, those who lived in and maintained them, and those who repaired them. 'With advancing age, however, these ships have inevitably become more and more out of date in their armament and their fighting qualities and more and more expensive to keep in reserve in a reasonable state of repair. The Admiralty has been forced to the conclusion that, even If we could under present-day conditions afford the manpower and the money that would be entailed in keeping them in reserve, they would be of very little value in any future war. That is the reason why we have now, with very real regret, to announce that they are to be scrapped.DARTMOUTH TO BROADEN ITS SYSTEM. FIRST LORD'S IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT. A new scheme of entry of cadets into the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, was announced hy Viscount Hall the First Lord of the Admiralt3^ at a press conference at the Aclmiralty on January 28th and in the House of Lords. The decision to change the system of entry into the Royal Navy through Dartmouth was no reflection whatever upon the success of the present system. Officers of the Royal Navy had stood the supreme tests required of them, particularly in two world wars, and had served their country -with great distinction. But in the changed circumstances of today, particularly national education, the system of officer entry into the Royal Navy should he founded on the broadest possible basis. 'The new system of entry and its examination have been designed to ensure that no boy is prevented from competing by reason of his social status, school, or financial standing,' proceeded the First Lord. 'I also stress the point that the Navy must have officers with high academic attainments and high qualities of character and leadership; the Admiralty is offering prospects of a life-long career and must look for the best candidates. In determining the details of the scheme the Admiralty has had full discussion with the Ministry of Education and other responsible educational authorities and associations and has taken the opinion of eminent Naval officers. 'The new system will apply to the Executive, Engineering and Supply Branches. There will be three entries of cadets in each year and the new age at entry will be 16 to 16 years if months. Examinations will be held in or near the candidates own schools. The interview part of the competitive examination will be widened in scope. The first entry under the new system will be in September 1948, and the examination for this entry will be held in March next. 'Cadets will spend six terms at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, followed by a period of eight months training on a Training Cruiser before they go to the Fleet as Midshipmen, Tuition and maintenance will be free. The Admiralty will make actual provision of uniform and replacements during the cadet period. Parents will be expected to pay for the cost of uniform and the cadets personal expenses, according to their means; under this arrangement some will not pay anything. 'This, 3 m&gt;u will understand, is only one of the three sources from which the Royal Navy obtains its officers. The Special Entry at age 18 will be continued and, as previously announced, the present aim of the Admiralty is to recruit up to 25 /c of its commissioned officers by promotion from the lower deck, life intend that half the remainder will ultimately be obtained from the age 16 entry and the other half from the Special Entry.1 4 'In initiating this new scheme^ the Board of Admiralty and I are confident that it will achieve the important objectives in mind, that is to maintain the high standard and long tradition of service in the Royal Navy v/hile affording full opportunity to the best and brightest boys from all walks of life whatever schools they may be attending. We are already assured of the closest co-operation of the Ministry of Education and of the Scottish Education Department, and are confident that v/e can similarly rely upon the willing help of all public and State secondary and grammar schools.' RETURN OF BRITISH SHIPS FROM RUSSIA. A report from Rome states it was learned officially in the Italian capital that the return of the United States Cruiser MILWAUKEE, lent to Russia during the war, has been delayed due to sharp differences within a Commission of British, American, French and Russian naval experts meeting there to dispose of Italy's fleet. British warships loaned to Russia were Battleship : ROYAL SOVEREIGN, 29,150 tons, temporary Russian name, ARCIiANGELSK„ Destroyers : (all Town class, 1,090 tons;) BRIGHTON, CHELSEA, CHURCHILL (lost on active service) GE0RGET0Y/N, LEAMINGTON, RICHMOND, R0XB0R0UGH and ST. ALBANS. Submarines : SUNFISH, 7^8 tons (lost on active service) and UNBROKEN, UNISON and URSULA, all 646 tons. A NEW ERA OF MARINE ENGINEERIN G? Having been first afloat with a craft powered by a gas turbine, the Royal Navy is developing this class of machinery. The Engineer in Chief of the Fleet, Vice Admiral (e) D.C. Ford, C.B. , C.B.E., said at q. Press Conference in the Admiralty on January 30th that this might well be 'the start of a new era in marine engineering.' The Admiralty, he said, was putting a large amount of money into marine gas turbine research. They were endeavouring to develop a gas turbine for a life of about 10,000 running hours, or the equivalent of about 25 years normal life at sea. The development is dependent on the production of better alloys by metallurgists. It was the recent work of metallurgists which had made the operation of the gas turbine possible.- 5 Admiral Ford, said he did not expect much saving in space by the adoption of gas turbine engines but he thought there might be a saving in weight and somev/hat better thermal efficiency. Experiments with gas turbine machinery were taking place abroad, but more particularly for land use; two of the countries concerned were Switzerland and the U.S.A. An Admiralty statement issued to the Press explained how industrial exports have examined a 'gatric' unit installed in M, G-.B. 2009 9 with which sea trials began in the Solent last year towards the end of August. ^ The statement continues: 'In the course of these trials some 3,000 tons of salt air has been pumped into red hot combustion chamber. It was expected that salt deposits would foul the blades of the compressor which forces the air into the combustion chamber, and that there would have been a considerable lowering of the power output. In fact, the power loss was less than was expected and, when the engine was opened up at the Manchester works of Messrs. Metropolitan-Vickers, there was less salt than had been anticipated. The good general condition of the engine augurs well for the future of the gas turbine as a Marine propulsion unit. 'M.G.B. 2009 is to be fitted with a new slightly modified ^atric unit, v/hich will soon start sea trials in the Solent and this unit will be run continuously for many hundreds of hours to ascertain its total useful life at sea. 'The Admiralty is, also, planning larger gas turbine machinery for installation in a vessel of the escort type. In this project the machinery has been designed for marine purposes from the initial stage and it is predicted that its durability and efficiency will be greater than those of the Gatric units. 'Another project is the powering with gas turbine machinery of H.M.S. GREY GOOSE, a gun boat of 230 tons, considerably larger than M. G. B. 2009 • 'Built by J. Samuel White &amp; Co., Ltd., of Cowes and powered by compact and lightweight steam turbine machinery, she was the leader of a flotilla which acquired a reputation as 'E Boat Killers'. Commanded by Lieutenant Commander Peter Scott, M.B.E. , D.S.C., R.N.V.R,, she led the flotilla in a series of dashing actions against the enemy shipping which became a regular feature of war news. 'With their steel hulls, these gunboats were regarded as 'miniature destroyers' but they were officially classed as 'light coastal force craft' and the enemy was left to believe that they were ordinary M.G.B. *s.' Admiral Ford also stated at the Conference that M.G.B. 2009, was, in some ways, as revolutionary as the TURBINIA in the Jubilee Spithead Review in 1897. As a result of the latter, about 8 or 9 years later, the MAURETANIA broke the Atlantic speed record and ships began to increase in size until they reached the proportions of the two 'QUEENS'. NOTE: In the past two hundred years there have been four kinds of new prime movers - Watts Steam Engine, the Parsons steam turbine, the Internal Combustion Engine and the Gas Turbine, which has a history dating back (in patents) well into the 18th Century.SUBMARIjNE GR/iVITY SURVEY IN ENGLISH CHANNEL The Departinent of Geodesy and Geophysics at Cambridge University is to make a gravity survey on board H.M. Submarine TiiLENT in the English Channel during May 0 The project is being carried out under the auspices of the Royal Society with the full co-operation of the Royal Navy. The object of the expedition is to obtain information about the structure of the channel basin which should help in interpreting how the geology of Southern England is related to the Continent, The cruise will last for four weeks and cover the area between England and Prance from Plymouth to Hastings, H.M. Submarine TALENT will be manned by her normal complement of Officers and men of the Royal Navy but three civilian scientists, Mr. B.C. Browne, Mr. R.I.B. Cooper and Mr. H.L.G. Gilbert will also be on board. She will be equipped with special apparatus, some of which has generously been lent by the Danish Geodetic Commission. Accurate measurement of this kind can only be made under very steady conditions, and the movement of a surface vessel would make it impossible to make the necessary observations except in a dead calm. A submarine, however, can dive below the waves and even in rough weather at a depth of 100 to 200 feet the boat is so steady that measurements can be made at sea almost as accurately as on land. This method of working was originally devised by the well known Dutch scientist. Professor F.A. Veiling Meiness and has been used by him to make over a thousand gravity measurements all over the oceans. The work has also been carried on by the U.S.A. , Prance, Italy, Russia and Japan and has recently been taken up in this country. A British Expedition in August 1946 on board H.M. S. TUDOR surveyed an area from the north coast of Spain to the Rockall Bank. B esides valuable scientific results, the experience gained showed how the apparatus and technique might be improved. The forthcoming survey in the Channel will provide an opportunity of testing out these new ideas, as well as throwing light on the geological structure and history of the English Channel. u 0NE OP THE MOST COURAGEOUS ACTS OP ALL TBCE ' naval dispatch TELLS STORY OP ATTACK ON THE TIRPITZ 'It is clear that courage and enterprise of the very highest order in the close presence of the enemy were shown by these very gallant gentlemen, whose daring attack will surely go down to history as one of the most courageous acts of all time.' It is with this tribute that Vice Admiral C.B. Barry, C.B., D.S.O., (then serving as Admiral, Submarines) concluded one of two dispatches on operation 'Source' - the damaging attack on the German battleship TIRPITZ by British midget submarines on September 22nd, 19A3 “ published in the supplement to 'The London Gazette' on February 11th.7 Two officers who took part in the C attack, Lieutenant B.G-.C. Place, R.N., and Lieutenant D. Cameron, R.N.R. , were decorated by the King with the Victoria Cross, Both were released from imprisonment in Germany and their reports and entries in the War Diary of the German Naval Staff enabled a further dispatch to be made to complete the story. This was written by Rear-Admiral (now Vice Admiral) G-.E. Creasy, C.B., C.B.E. , D.S.O., M.V.O., Admiral (Submarines), and it amplifies in material respects the dispatches by his predecessor, Vice Admiral Barry, Operation ’’Source' began on September l^th and 12th, when the submarines TRUCULENT, STRTIS, 'EriRASHER, SEANMPH, STUBBORN and SCEPTRE left Loch Cairribawn for the Norwegian coast, each with an X-craft in toy/. After three days the weather began to deteriorate, and the submarines ran into difficulties. Tows parted, X-9, in charge of SYRTIS, was lost, X-8 developed a leak, and after both she and her parent submarine had been damaged by the explosion of her jettisoned charges, had to be scuttled. Four of the six thus remained. A mine became impaled on the bows of X-7, Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Place, 'cleared it by deft foot work, remarking as he did so that this was the first time he had kicked a mine away by its horns.' On September 20th - D-Day - THRASHER, TRUCULENT, STUBBORN and SCEPTRE transferred the operational crews to their X-craft near the entrance to Soroy Sound after dark and withdrew seaward to assume patrol. The X-craft entered the Sound independently. 'That four of the six craft which set out should have made these passages, varying between 1,000 and 1,500 miles, in tow of submarines without major incident, to be slipped from their exact position 10 days later, was more than I ever antici pated,' declares Admiral Barry. 'I consider that this passage is a fine exanple of seamanship and determination by all concerned.' Later, however, X-10 developed defects v/hich compelled her commanding officer to abandon the attack. She was taken in tow again by STUBBORN, but had to be sunk in bad weather. From detailed reports supplied by Lieutenant Cameron (X-6), and Lieutenant Place (X-7), after their repatriation, Admiral Creasy, in his dispatch, was able to give the full story of the attack. Slipped from their tov/ing submarines between 6.45 p#m, and 8 p,m. on September 20th, the three remaining X-craft negotiated on the surface the minefields reported off Soroy Sound. At 11.15 p.m. X-7 sighted another X-craft and exchanged greetings. The other craft was certainly the X-5, commanded by Lieutenant H. Henty-Creer, which the TIRPITZ later claimed to have sunk by gunfire, X-5 is known to have been within 500 yards of the anti torpedo nets. None of the crew survived.During the night before the attack both X-6 and X-7 remained submerged in Altenfiord charging batteries and making good defects. X-7 had to fit a spare exhaust pipe, with tape, canvas and chewing gum. Then at if a.m. on September 22nd X-7 passed through the boom defence gap at the entrance to Kaafiord, dived to avoid an out going motor-launch, and was caught in anti-tor'sedo nets once used to house the LUTZOW, but then empty. X-6, delayed by increasing trouble with her periscope, passed through the gap an hour later. She did so on the surface, astern of a small coaster, in broad daylight. She then dived to 60 feet, and moved towards the TIRPITZ by dead reckoning. On coming to periscope depth again she found herself so close to the German tanker NORTMARK that she had to alter course to avoid the mooring buoy. 'To add to her difficulties,' observes Admiral Creasy, the periscope again clouded over and the periscope hoisting motor brake burnt out, resulting in manual control of the brake being necessary when raising or lowering the periscope.' But soon she was through the boat entrance of the TIKPITZ nets and within striking distance of the target. Meanwhile X-7, after an hour’s work, had freed herself from the nets in the middle of the fiord. She, too, headed for the TIRPITZ, dived to 75 feet to pass under the battleship’s net defences, and once # again got caught. Up to this point no suspicions had been aroused in the enemy’s mind that an attack was iiriminent, and normal harbour routine was in progress. But once again X-6 was in trouble. After passing the gate she ran aground and broke surface twice, the second time 80 yards abeam of the battleship. She was sighted and identified, and the alarm was raised. Admiral Creasy then gives this vivid description of what happened: 'X-6 by this time^had no gyro compass, as this had been put out of action by the grounding and subsequent violent angles on the boat, and the periscope was almost flooded. She was, therefore, taken blindly in v/hat was imagined to be the target’s direction hoping to fix her position by the shadow of the battleship. 'After five minutes X-6 got caught in an obstruction which she took to be the anti-torpedo net on the far (stcorboard) side of the TIRPITZ. 'Lieutenant Cameron straightened his craft up, manoeuvred clear of the obstruction, and surfaced close to the port bow of the TIRPITZ, when a brisk fire from hand grenades and small arms was opened on the submarine, 'Realising that escape was hopeless, Cameron destroyed the most secret equipment, backed his craft down until the stern was scraping iIRPITZ hull abreast of ’B’ turret, released his charges and scuttled the craft. She started to sink as a power boat from the TIRPITZ came alongside, and picked up the crew.'Meanwhile, as yet unseen, X-7 was struggling to free herself from the nets ahead of the TIRPITZ. She cleared herself only a few minutes before the explosion took place. 'Lieutenant Place’s description of his attack and escape contains some masterly understatements. After surfacing 'by some extraordinarily lucky chance' inside the nets, he explains, X-7 at full speed struck the TIEPITZ on the port side and slid gently under ■ the keel, where the starboard charge was released in the full shadow of the ship. The commander then went showly astern and released the port charge 150 feet to 200 feet farther aft. X-7 tried to find the position where she had come in. But, 'at 60 feet we were in the net again,' says Lieutenant Place. 'Without a compass I had no exact idea where we were; X-7's charges were due to explode in an hour - not to mention others which might go up at any time.' , In the next three-quarters of an hour X-7 was in and out of several nets, but later she was free, sliding over the net between the buoys on the surface. 'I did not look at the TIRPITZ at this time, as this method of overcoming net defences was new and absorbing,' he adds. He was intent on putting as much distance as possible between X-7 end the coming explosion and 'it was extremely annoying to run into another net at 60 feet.' Shortly after this there was a tremendous explosion. 'This evidently shook us out of the net, and on surfacing it was tiresome to see the TIEPITZ still afloat.' It having become inevitable to abandon X-7, which was now out of control, it was surfaced so close to a target that her commander was able to step on to it before the craft sank. Lieutenant Place was taken on board the TIEPITZ and there met the crew of X-6. What had been the result of this amasing exploit? The explosion had moved the TIRPITZ from her position, and inflicted considerable damage. Her three main engines, communications, steering, gunnery control positions and electrical installations were all put out of order and compartments flooded. Two months after the operation it was admitted by the G-erman Naval Staff that the battleship had been put out of action. Later, of course, she was destroyed by air attack, from which she had been virtually immune in Kaafiord, THE NAVIES ’DOUBLE’ RESCUE IN THE EESERT. Malta has sent us the following story which indicates the novelty of the Navy's peacetime tasks :- 'The H aV y has just effected a double rescue in the Western Desert, locating a grounded aircraft and would-be rescuers who became lost. 'A iVl alta-based 'Expeditor' aircraft from 728 Squadron, H.M.S. FALCON, piloted by Lieutenant (a) K.G-. Nicholson, R.N. , of Wood Green, London, with Sub-Lieutenant (a).C.H, Fursey, R.N. , of Barrow-in-Furness and Petty Officer C.p. McCullough, of Rosyth, as crew, had been despatched to pick up a Navy mine disposal team.'Arriving at Benghazi the pilot was requested to proceed immediately in search of an Egyptian air force 'Dove' that had ’force landed’ in the desert some 30 miles south-east of Benina, 'The 'Dove' was located after an hour’s search, undamaged hut out of fuel, amidst the wrecks of Rommel’s panzer divisions on the route taken by the victorious 8th Army. The Egyptian pilot was informed that a desert rescue party had set out and would be directed to the spot. 'This done the 'Expeditor' flew back to Benghazi, pre paring to stay the night, but hardly had a tired crew clambered into bed when there was an urgent summons to proceed at daybreak in search of the desert rescue party.’ 'The rescue party was located bogged down with still 30 miles to go, and fresh directions were passed. 'By the time rescuers and rescued met, the 'Expeditor' was well on its way back to Malta having completed its original task,' (Erom The 'Times of Malta,' January 14th, 1948). NEv7S OF NAVAL AUTHORS . Former Press secretary to the King, Captain Lewis Ritche, R.N., - 'Bartimous' the naval writer - was knighted at Buckingham Palace when the King invested him with the K.C.V.O. x x x «K At the age of 43 Commander Anthony Kimmins, R.N,, retired, the wellknown wartime radio commentator has written his autobiography which he calls 'Half Time' (Hyman 15/-). Many of the Commander’s famous broadcasts on the big naval operations of the war are incor porated in this book which have an invigorating freshness and acute sense of atmosphere. The literary critic of the ’’Birmingham Post' writes 'His first broadcast, a postscript on a Channel convoy in 1940, was a stop-gap engagement. It is to the credit of the then First Lord, Mr. A.V, Alexander, that the Admiralty realised they had made a ’find’ and that for the rest of the war Commander Kimmins was the star naval broadcaster, in the thick of all the trouble, whose arrival in a ship was enough to set the whole fleet agog with expectation of 'something doing'. He writes pleasantly, with the usual modesty and calculated understatement of the naval officer, but does not hesitate to say what he thinks of some ill- conceived operations that he had to explain as best he could to listeners, some of whom knew only too well that someone had blundered'THE KING-*S CRUISERS' Gordon Holman was one of the best naval correspondents of the ^Second World War, and his graphic record of the St. Nazaire raid, in which he took part, ranks justly as one of the most brilliant pieces of descriptive writing of the v/ar. With his long experience of the sea and of the Royal Navy, there can be few men better qualified to write of ! 'The King's Cruisers' (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 18s. net). In the course of a foreword. Admiral Sir James Somerville says: 'Gordon Holman has described most admirably the triumphs, the vicissitudes, the good times and the^bad times for these ships, both individually and collectively, and also the pride and affection which officers and men had for their ships,' The author has written his book according to no set plan, rather he has taken the names of individual or coupled cruisers and has woven together their war histories. Yet in the weaving, the stories have been given the interest and personality of the finest tapestry. ROYAL MARINES VOLUNTEER RESERVE A fleet Order published on December 12th announced that it ^ is intended to establish a Volunteer Reserve of the Royal Marines, ihis Jjorce will be known as the Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve (R.M.P.V.R.). It will be a counterpart of the R.N.V.R. and will be the first Volunteer Reserve to be established by the Royal Marines. Arrangements are still under consideration, but it is probable that the first training centre will be at Chatham, and that volunteers from the London area will travel to this centre for train ing purposes at weekends. Groups may later be set up at Portsmouth Plymouth, and other towns, and members of the Reserve will perform both part-time training at weekends and full-time training in H.M. Ships or establishments. -^ravelling expenses, training expenses •allowances and bounties will be paid at the same rates as to members oi the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and the Tep^p-^orial Army. Pay and allowances will be made during full-time training, AH ex-officers and other ranks, of any service, under the age of 45 may apply now to leave their names noted as applicants for the Reserve and further details and application forms may be obtained from the Commandant General, Royal Marines (R.M.P.V.R.)

Some of the ratings *n the Royal Navy who have been known familiarly as 'scribes' since the days of sailing ships and q uill Pens are to be known officially as Stenographers, while others will continue under the older names of Writer and Stores Rating. Although typewriters have been used afloat for years, their users have not been oilicrally trained and rated for the job./ 12 In a Fleet Order, approval for the new Stenographer 'branch is announced and arrangements are being made for recruiting to start forthwith. The age Unit is 17 ~ 23 years, although entry as Probationary Stenographer will not take place before the age of I7y is reached. Candidates will be entered on a Special Service engagement but the period of their active service will be 3 years only, instead of 7 years, as applicable to other Special Service Ratings. The period of engagement of Probationary Stenographers will, therefore, be for 12 years from the date of enhay, 0 f which period 3 years from the age of 18 or date of entry, if later, will be in the Royal Navy and the residue in the Royal Fleet Reserve, Candidates for Stenographer will, if possible, be required to have a knowledge of shorthand (60 words per minute) with an appropriate speed of typing but if it is found Impossible to recruit men with these qualifications, it will be necessary to accept them without and to give them complete training in the service. As the work is only appropriate for junior ratings, Stenographers will not be advanced beyond Leading Rates but, after completing 3 years as a Stenographer, the opportunity will exist for the rating to become G-eneral Service Writers or Leading Writers, according to the rate they have obtained in the Stenographer Branch. The ratings of the Stenographer Branch will be eligible for consideration for promotion to Officer rank in the Supply and Secretariat Branch provided they are recommended, and transfer to Continuous Service Writer or Stores ratings, when they will be considered under the regulations applicable to those ratings. NEWS FROM THE R.N.V.R . A memorial tablet has been unveiled in H.M.S. EAGLET, headquarters of the Mersey Division of the R.N.V.R. , in memory of those of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who lost their lives while serving in Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships during the war. The unveiling ceremony was performed by Captain H. Grattan, R.N. (retired), D.E.M.S. Staff Officer for the Liverpool area during the war. Representatives of shipping companies, former members of the D.E.M.S. Service, officers and ratings of H.M.S. EAGLET and others were present. Captain Grattan said 2,663 officers and ratings of the N avy and Marines lost their lives while serving in defensively Equipped Merchant Ships throughout the world. During six years of the war more than 30*000 men joined the D.E.M.S. Service. + + + + + After L3 years' service in the Tyne as an R.N.V.R. depot ship, H.M,S. SATELLITE has been towed to Gateshead to be broken up. During the war years, thousands of seamen were trained in the ship.- 13 - TEE R.N.V.R. A HERO OF THE 11 LITTLE SHIPS ”, There was an interesting gathering at the R.N.V.R. Club, London, when brother officers of the late Lieutenant Commander Robert Hichens, R.N.V.R., who won the D.S.O. and bar and the L.S.C. with two bars as the greatest of the earlier Coastal Forces leaders, saw his portrait presented to Lord Howe on behalf of the club. Mr. peter Scott, whose work with the 'little ships' during the war gained him the D. S.C. and appointment as M. B.E., painted the portrait. Another brother officer Lieutenant David James, R.N.V.R., who served with Hichens until taken prisoner, organised ohe fund which has enabled the club to pay this tribute to Hichen's memory.Office of Staff Officer (intelligence) East Indies Station.

Curzon, dedicated a memorial window to officers and men of H.M.S. EXETER who lost their lives in the second world war. The window depicts Christ raising St, peter from the water, with a ship in the background bearing the crest of H.M. S. EXETER on its sail. The service was attended by about 200 survivors and relatives. Captain O.L. Gordon, R.N. , who was in command when the ship was sunk in the Java Sea on March 1st, 1942, invited the Dean, Dr. S.C. Carpenter, to accept custody of the window. The Dean accepted the gift and dedicated the window 'to the glory of God and in memo^ of the officers and men who gave their lives in the last two actions of II.M. S. EXETER in the Java Sea on February 27th, 1942, and those of her company who died in captivity; and as a thank-offering to Almighty God from those who, surviving the dangers of sea and the violence of the enemy, by God’s grace returned to their native land.' The Rev. G. O’C. Fitzgerald, who was the ship’s chaplain and spent five years in cajjtivity, also took part in the service. CHA.THAA IvMiQRlAL : Work has atarted on a memorial to preserve the memory of H.M, Ships manned by Chatham Port Division and lost during World War II, (1939-1946) together with officers and men of the Division who died while serving their country. The memorial includes a series of ten stained glass windows and the decoration of the choir and santuary of the Church of St, George, Chatham. The windows are being designed by Mr. Hugh Easton. The Chatham R.N. Barracks Canteen Committee has given a sum sufficient to meet the greater part of the work but subscriptions may be sent to the Senior Chaplain, R.N. Barracks, Chatham. MR, CHURCHILL TO UNVEIL ABBEY MEMORIAL : ~ V.C.s of the two World Wars will be among representatives of the three Services who will attend the unveiling and dedication ceremony of a Joint Services Memorial at Westminster Abbey on May 21st. The memorial will commemorate those who lost their lives in the Submarine Branch of the Royal Navy (1914-18 and 1939-45)* the Airborne Forces (1939-45) and the Commandos (1939-45).-—2 The memorial, which is being erected in the cloisters of the Abbey, and is designed by Mr. G-ilbert Ledward, will be unveiled by Mr. Winston Churchill, who will also give an address. It is expected that about 2,000 people will be present in the Abbey, a maximum number of seats being allocated for next- of-kin, and the ceremony in the cloisters will be relayed by loudspeaker. HATFIELD COMMIQRATES H.M, S. TWEED : In commemoration of the war time association of Hatfield with the frigate H.M.S. TWEED, which was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in mid-Atlantic In January, 1944, the Admiralty has presented Hatfield Rural District ^#1 Council with a White Ensign. The presentation coincided with the eighteenth anniversary celebrations of the opening of the Council Offices at Hatfield, on Thursday March 18 th. As there are at present no surviving officers of H.M.S. TWEED in the United Kingdom, the ensign was presented to the Chairman of the Council, Mr. C. Gordon Maynard, J.P. , C.C, ) by Commander D. Maitland-Makgill-Crichton, D.S.O., D. S.C., R.N. , who, as a destroyer captain during the war, was frequently engaged on similar duties to those performed by H.M.S. TWEED. Hatfield Rural District Council adopted H.M.S, TWEED under the wartime Warships Weeks’ Adoption Scheme. PACIFIC . SCRAPPING OF JAPANESE 'WARSHIPS . In his explanatory statement on the Navy Estimates presented to Parliament, the First Lord of the Admiralty (Viscount Hall) stated that all ships of the Japanese N a vy larger than destroyers have now been scrapped or sunk. Of the remaining vessels, which are all demilitarised and in very poor condition, the United Kingdom had so far been allocated 7 destroyers, 16 escort vessels, 2 transports, 4 minelayers, 1 submarine chaser, 3 minesweepers. These vessels were, however, of little value to the Governments of the United Kingdom, the ^ Commonwealth or the Colonies and it had already been decided to scrap 1 destroyer, 6 escorts, 3 minelayers and 3 minesweepers out of this total and in all probability a majority of the remainder would also be scrapped. FIRST LIGHT METAL COASTAL CRAFT . The first light metal alloy coastal craft to be completed in Britain, and probably the first in the world, was launched from the yard of Messrs, Saunders Engineering &amp; Shipyard Ltd, , Beaumaris, North Wales, on April 22nd. The craft, an experimental one, is to be known as M.T.B. 539. She is 75 ft, in length and has a beam of just under 20 ft. Her machinery is of rormal internal combustion type and is sufficient to give her a high speed and good endurance. ■IN'|The main interest in this craft lies in the fact that her hull, including frames and elcin, is made of an aluminium alloy, which weighs about one third the weight of steel. The hull will be somev/hat lighter than an equivalent hull of wooden construction. Such a saving in weight can be used to make possible increased speed, increased range or increased armament and equipment. The method of construction may make possible the more rapid production of such craft. NAVAL AIRCRAFT TO BE EMBAIliED . It has been decided that all future naval aircraft shipped abroad in His Majesty's Aircraft Carriers shall be ”embalmed' to ensure that they are in good preservation when they arrive at their destination. The first sizeable shipment, preserved by this method was despatched recently in the aircraft carrier H.M.S. VENGEANCE, During the war the U.S« authorities developed a technique for coating aircraft with various substances applied by spraying, and the Admiralty took steps to develop a suitable substance manufactured in this country which would provide a movable coating. The material now used is manufactured under the name of 'Halothene' and the first experimental shipment of aircraft coated with this substance was sent to Australia at the end of 19M5. To minimise the results of any break in the Halothene envelope, a quantity of a dessicent, i. e. a moisture absorbing substance, is placed in the aircraft before it is sprayed. THE GROWTH OF BRITAIN'S PEACETIME NAVY LIGHT FLEET CARRIER LAUNCHED AT BELFAST . The launching of the Hermes class light fleet carrier H.M.S. BULWARK from the Musgrave Shipyard of Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff, Belfast, on June 22nd is another indication of the build-up of Britain's peacetime Navy and the growth of Naval aviation. The warship was launched and named by Countess Granville, a sister of the Queen and wife of the Governor of Northern Ireland, and is of the same class as the CENTAUR, launched by the Duchess of Kent last year. This is the tenth aircraft carrier to be built by Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff since 1935. She has an extreme length of 736 |- ft. and a breadth on the water line of 90 ft. Her design was the subject of a long series of model experiments and electric welding has been used extensively in the construction of her hull. Her geared turbine machinery will generate more than 80,000 i.h.p.4 The BULWARK is now the third aircraft carrier fitting out at Belfast, others being her sister ship the CE1TTAUR and the Fleet Carrier H.M.S. EAG-LE. After the launching ceremony the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Sir Basil Brooke, Bt., proposed a toast to the success of the vessel, and the Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland, Admiral Sir Frederick Dalrynple Hamilton, K.C.B., in reply, described the ship as the most important unit of the modern fleet. In proposing a toast to 'the builders” the Flag Officer (Air) Home, Vice-Admiral R.H. Portal, C.B. , D.S.C., said that ^ Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff had secured their first Admiralty contract in 1866, for a screw-propelled gunboat. In the first world war they had built a fleet of 14 dummy battleships which were indis tinguishable from the real article, in the. second world war they had constructed a warship tonnage of approximately 350,000 tons, as well as many merchant ships. Responding to this toast, the Chairman of Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff, Sir Frederick Rebbeck, recalled that since H.M.S. FORMIDABLE was launched in 1939 Belfast yards had launched eight first line carriers. DE VELOPMENT OF GAS TURBINE-PROPELLED GRAFT FURTHER TRIALS OF G-ATRIO UNIT . The rebuilding of the Gatric unit in His Majesty's Motor Gunboat 2009, in a more powerful and durable form, heralds the second phrase of the sea trials of the first gas turbine in a marine craft. Full power trials with this improved gas turbine engine will begin in the Solent in July and will continue for several months. A series of specific tests will be made, including endurance and manoeuvrability trials, until the engine has completed between 300-400 hours total running. This long period ^ of running should yield valuable data on the behaviour and durability of the special metals used in various parts of the engine in which very high temperatures develop. The rebuilt unit includes, among other features, a new design of compressor turbine. It is this feature that will enable the engine to develop greater power than was previously possible and it will also make it possible to maintain this power for a longer time. The power from the gas turbine is transmitted through shaft, gearing and a propeller of conventional design - an arrangement considered superior for marine purposes to the alternative propulsion by the reaction of a jet blowing astern. Part of the engine is, however, of the type used in jet aircraft pov/er units.5 Industrial engineers and technicians from many British firms will see G-atric operate at sea. During the trials it is anticipated M.C-.B. 2009 will undertake a cruise to a British port, or ports, some distance from the Solenc, out the details of this cruise are not yet available. xWAL AVIATION BOmBINO QA H. M, S. DEI SON: Barracuda naval aircraft from their base at Arbroath began bombing the 33,000-ton battleship H.M.S. ^ KELSON, moored off the island of Inchkeith, Scotland, early in June in a series of trials which are expected to continue for three months. Two hundred bombs will bo dropped at various angles to test the effect on armour and structure. Preparations have been going on for many months and scientists of the Admiralty research laboratory at Teddington constructed camera and other apparatus, at an estimated cost of £35,000, to photograph the bombing. The camera batteries, which record six pictures a second, have been set up on Inchkeith and on the Life coast. They show exactly what happens from the time the bomb leaves the aircraft until it strikes the target. Scientists, 'frogmen”, and divers will examine the ship after each hit, and launches are standing ready to take technicians and repair teajns to the vessel after each bomb hit. Bombing will stop if there is any danger of the vessel sinking. NAVAL D ESPATCHES . ENGAmffl NT ¥ITH I TALI AN PLEJA l The brief engagement with the Italian fleet olf ohe Calabrian coast in uhe Central Mediterranean in July 19JO, described as 'Operation M,A, 5' - a sweep by the Fleet to cover two convoys on passage from Malta to Alexandria - was described by Admiral Sir Andrew B. Cunningham (no?/ Admiral of the Fleet Lord Cunningham of Hyndhope, K.T. , G.C.3 a , O.M., D. S.0.) in a despatch as Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean, ^ published in the 'London Gazette” on April 28th. This was the first time contact was made with Italian surface forces, other than destroyers, and the first time British forces received serious attention from the Italian Air Force. It is not clear* what brought the enemy to sea but the fleet retired close oO its bases, hoping to draw the British war ships into an engagement in Italian waters, 'If this were, in xact, the eiemys intention, he was not ad together disappointed,' wrote Admiral Cunningham, From^an examination ol enemy reports it appears that his forces consisted of 2 battleships, 16 (possibly 17 or 18) cruisers, and 23 to 30 destroyers. VT rr ' The actior tco ' ! 5 pl^ce at very long range and H.M.S. ,'vAhk.P_ j.L was she onby capital ship which got within range of the enemy s battleships, H.M.S. MALAYA fired a few salvos which fell some 3,000 yards short. H.M.S. ROYAL. SOVEREIGN, owing to her lack of speed, never got into action at all.~®T(5!|!I ■» - 6 - 'The WARSPITE f s hit on one of the enemy battleships at 26,000 yards range might perhaps be described as a lucky one. Its tactical effect: was to induce the enemy to turn away and break off the action, which was unfortunate, but strategically it probably had an important effect on the Italian mentality. 'Our cruisers - there were only four in action - were badly outnumbered and at times came under a very heavy fire. They were superbly handled by Vice-Admiral J.C. Tovey, (now Admiral of the Fleet Lord Tovey of Langton Matravers, G-.C.B., K.B.E. , D.S.O. ), who by his skilful manoeuvring managed to main tain a position in the van and to hold the enemy's Cruiser Squadron, and at the same time avoid damage to his own force.' Admiral Cunningham concludes, 'The meagre material results derived from this brief meeting with the Italian Fleet were naturally very disappointing to me and all under my command, but the action Was not without value. It must have shown the Italians that their Air Force and submarines could not stop our Fleet penetrating into the Central Mediterranean and that only their main fleet could seriously interfere with our operating there.' NAVY'S LOSSES OFF CRETE . The battle of Crete and the final withdrawal are described by Admiral Sir Andrew B. Cunningham (now Admiral of the Fleet Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope) in a despatch issued on May 24th. The object of the operations which took place from May 15th to May 2?th, 1941;? was to defend Crete, where troops just withdrawn from Greece had been landed. On the latter date it was decided that the island could no longer be held, and from then until June 1st all efforts were directed to the withdrawal. Lord Cunningham, who was C,-in-C. Mediterranean, recalls that all his light forces had been at sea practically without intermission since March 4th, and that the final phase of the withdrawal threw on them a strain which Was well-nigh intolerable. Four cruisers and eight destroyers had been sunk and practically every ship of the Fleet had been damaged, two battleships and the only remaining aircraft carrier - the FORMIDABLE - so severely as to be unserviceable for some months. Nevertheless, as the Admiral remarked, 'the Mediterranean Fleet could claim to have played a worthy part.' During the land fighting the Fleet had landed rein forcements for the Army and had prevented any seaborne invasion. When the withdrawal was ordered some 17*000 British and Inperial troops were brought safely to Egypt and provisions and stores were landed for those who had to be left behind. The Royal Marines, after manning the island's defences, fought gallantly with the rearguard and had to leave half their number behind. The British A.ir Force throughout the Near East had been so reduced by operations that it was impossible to maintain any fighter force in Crete at all. The Navy's task of preventing seaborne invasion of the island entailed the ships operating continuously within easy reach of the enemy's unopposed air forces,7 but no enemy ship succeeded in reaching Crete or intervening in the 'battle. The German attack began on May 20th with intense bombing of the principal British airfields at Mai erne, closely followed by the dropping of airborne troops. Half the Fleet was already at sea south of Crete - the other half at Alexandria ready to relieve it when needing fuel or ammunition - and the heavy ships moved to the westward to guard against interference by the main Italian fleet while the cruisers and destroyers had the task of dealing with any seaborne invading force. At night they swept the v/aters north of Crete, and on the night of May 21st a large convoy of coasting steamers, yachts, ^ and caiques, estimated to be carrying A,000 German troops, was destroyed by a force of British cruisers and destroyers. The next morning a similar convoy was sighted by another British force and some ships in it were sunk. The convoy turned back. Cruisers and destroyers continued to patrol Cretan waters at night and one or two more troop carrying caiques were destroyed; but the range of enemy air attacks was steadily extended and the Fleet's losses during daylight began to mount. The military situation worsened steadily, Eneny airborne troops continued to be poured in while the landing of reinforcements, stores, and ammunition became more and more difficult. At the same time, damage to the Fleet was mounting. On May 27th General Wavcll informed the Prime Minister that Crete was no longer tenable, and the order to withdraw was given. As much embarkation as possible was carried out in the harbours of Suda Bay and Heraklion on the north coast, but that became impossible. Finally the rearguard had to withdraw across the mountainous backbone of the island to be embarked from open beaches on the south coast. That could be done only at night, and the ships had to leave by 3 a.m. to be deal'’ of the coast, and of air attack, by daylight. Some thousands of the rearguard could not be brought away. On the night of June 1st - 2nd, even if it had been decided that any more of those remaining could disengage and be embarked, _ the only ships available would have been two battleships and five destroyers; the rest of the Fleet was either too damaged or too slow. So ended what was, perhaps, the most disastrous phase of the war at sea for Britain. RAID ON THE LOFOTEN ISLANDS . The combined operation - the raid on German - controlled oil depots - in the Lofoten islands on March 4th, 1941, is reported on by the naval and military commanders. Captain (now Rear-Admiral) G. Caslon, C.B.E., R.N., and Brigadier J.C. Kaydon, of the Special Service Brigade, In itself, this operation was small and unimportant, though highly successful. Complete surprise was achieved, and the whole raid went absolutely according to plan, no resistance being encountered.8 &amp; is of particular interest as having been practical]^ the first of the combined operations which culminated in the invasion of Normandy three years later.; and - although this was not realized until the German archives were captured at the end of the war - it caused Hitler’s apprehensions to be continually centred on the Norwegian coast. He lavished elaborate defences there and used up vast resources which would have been much more trouble to the allies if they had been employed elsewhere. It was also noteworthy for the close and cordial collaboration that was established from the first between the naval and military contingents employed - the conditions wore peculiar at that date in that there was no necessity for an air contingent in such high latitudes. Both Captain Casion*s and Brigadier Hayden* s reports - which were compiled after they had separated on return to this country - conclude with obviously sincere tributes to the officers of the other service with whom they had been working.v Office of Staff Officer (intelligence) East Indies Station, Naval Headquarters, Trincomalee, 9th October, 1948.

PERIODICAL mvs hETThE. NO,5 . HOIvIE PIEET SAILS AC I'lAJTOVER BUILD-UP IS AM'10 URGED . As the Horae Fleet was preparing to sail from Portland for its autumn cruise to the West Indies and South Africa, important announcements were made in London concerning the build-up of Naval manpower. Viscount Hall, the First Lord of the Admiralty, said in the House of Lords on September 22nd that the Royal Navy was recruiting twice as many men for regular service as at ary other period in peacetime. As to the Reserves, it was intended to set up a new Emergency Reserve consisting of men with previous service in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who volunteered for immediate recall in the event of an emergency. Such volunteers would not have to undertake any training in peace-time; they would be screened by the Ministry of Labour to ensure that they could be released from civil employment when they were required. During this year plans for the building up of the Royal Navy had been progressing and evidence was at hand in the autumn cruise of the Home Fleet, which marked the largest and most important naval exercise since the war. On the following day details of the needs of the various Reserve categories published in recent months were supplemented by Vice-Admiral Sir Wilfred R, Patterson, K.C.B., C.V.O., C.B.E., the Admiral Commanding Reserves, at a Press Conference held on board H.M. S. PRESIDENT, the headquarters training ship of the London Division, R.N.V.R. He explained that for ratings the Navy relies chiefly on the Royal Fleet Reserve, which consists of men who have had not less than three years in the Navy. This was formerly composed chiefly of men who had signed on for seven years' regular service to be followed by five in the R.F.R,, but it is now also open to men who have served for not less than three years during or since the war. R.F.R. men draw a retainer of from 1s, a day, and do a week's training every other year. Some 17,000 are now enrolled, and the present intake is 700 a month, which it is hoped to increase to 1,000, no maximum having been fixed to total numbers. The next most important source is the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve ^ ^ corresponding to the Territorial Army - which is organised in 12 divisions. Its present strength is 3&gt;000 officers and men — which includes four air squadrons - but it is hoped to increase that figure to 15,000. Members are divided into two categories - List I, wno live within reach ol a division headquarters and can do evening training, and List II, who do only annual training of 14 days afloat.A separate 'branch is the R.N.V. Wireless Reserve, who train in their own homes as well as various centres, of which there will shortly be nearly 30 open. Some 1,250 officers and men of the R.N.V.(w)*R. are needed. Another separate branch is the Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve, newly created, for which the first two depots are to be opened soon. The present requirement is 1,500 officers and men, but this will increase. For officers there is also the R.N.V. Supplementary Reserve, who do no training - beyond what they organize for them selves - but undertake to come up for service when called on. This v/as in existence before the war; it is now open to those who held temporary commissions during the war and have since been released. Corresponding to this for ratings is the new Royal Naval Emergency Reserve - R.N.E.R. - with its counterpart for the Marines - R.M.E.R. - consisting of ox-naval ratings and Marines who are willing to serve if called on in an emergency. The figure for the Naval and Marine Emergency Reserves combined is 50,000. The matter of the old-established Royal Naval Reserve, which consists of officers and men of the Merchant Navy, is not so easy to settle, since it is bound up with the war-time organi zation of the Mercantile Marine. 'Work on reconstitution is now in hand. Meanwhile, though the Reserve is in a state of suspended animation, one-third of the existing 1,600 R.N.R. officers who are eligible to enrol have already done so. For the Wrens, too, there is a Reserve, the Women’s Royal Naval Reserve, consisting of former officers and ratings of the Wrens with not less than a year’s service who are willing to serve in an emergency. Present numbers are 1 ,060 officers and 2,150 Wrens; 10,000 in all are wanted* Since no definite maximum has been fixed for the officers in the R.N.V.S.R. or men in the R.F.R., it is not possible to state a single figure for the increases in Reserves now being made. Apart from these two categories, the Admiralty anas at some 65,000. Dealing with questions of equipment for the Forces during a debate in the House of Commons on September 23rd, Mr, A.V. Alexander the Minister of Defence, announced that the programme for refitting ships in reserve is being speeded up, partly in the Royal Dockyards and partly by contract. Since the war the Royal Dockyards have been carrying out a . certain aaount of commercial work but they will now revert to their proper function and will give high priority to refitting a number of ships in the Reserve Fleet. FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY SAIDS IN THE DUPE OF YORK . It was against this background of actual and potential strength that the Home Fleet sailed from Portland on September 23rd. Not since the war had so many ships been seen in the harbour.The battleship DUKE OP YORK sailed wearing the flag of Admiral Sir Rhoderick R. McGrigor, K.G,B., D.S.O., the Commander- in-Ghief, Home Fleet, Viscount Hall, the First Lord of the Admiralty, was piped on hoard shortly before the Fleet sailed and he is being accompanied to the Test Indies by Sir John Lang, K.C.B., the Secretary of the Admiralty, Rear-Admiral P.B.R.W, William-Powlett, G.B.E., D.S.O., the Naval Secretary, and Mr. J.V. Battersby, his Principal Private Secretary, The First Lord and his party will arrive at Trinidad on October 9th and will return by air to the United Kingdom, arriving on October 13th. The DUKE OF YORK sailed in company with three aircraft carriers, the THESEUS, the VENGEANCE and the ILLUSTRIOUS, the cruisers DIADEM, CLEOPATRA and SIRIUS, and destroyers, frigates and auxiliary vessels. For the first three days of the voyage the ships took part in exercises as they proceeded into the North Atlantic. A detachment of coastal forces, comprising the First and Second Motor Torpedo Boat Flotillas and aircraft of the Fleet and of R.A.F. Bomber and Coastal Commands took part. Later the ILLUSTRIOUS and some of the smaller craft returned to Home ports while the main fleet proceeded on its cruise; H.M.S. DUKE OF YORK, the three cruisers and attendant destroyers to the West Indies and the aircraft carriers THESEUS and VENGEANCE with destroyers to South Africa. Some destroyers will also visit Y/est African ports. The three days' exercises concluded with a spectacular 'battle” in the Bay of Biscay and the First Lord, in a message, said 'The exercises have been of great interest to me as the ships' complements v/ere mainly young men who recently joined the Service under the regular entry scheme and a proportion of national servicemen. Their enthusiasm indicates their pride in the Royal Navy,' Further exercises will be carried out before the Fleet reaches the West Indies and on the return passage. The following ships are proceeding to the West Indies: DUKE OF YORK (battleship), DIADEM, CLEOPATRA and SIRIUS (cruisers), ST. JAIES, ST. KITTS, BARROSA, AISNB, SOLEBAY, CADIZ, GABBARD, SLUYS (destroyers), WAVE SOVEREIGN, FORT BEAUHARNOXS (Royal Fleet Auxiliaries). Ships proceeding to the West Indies are: THESEUS and VENGEANCE (light Fleet carriers), AGINCOURT, ALAMEIN, CORUNNA and JUTLAND (destroyers).naval aviation NAVAL FLYERS THRILL NEW YORK. Nine British planes, five belonging to No .806 Naval Air Squadron and four to the R.A.F., 'stole the show' at the ceremony of dedicating the New York international airport at Idlewild early in August. They took part with nearly 900 American warplanes in a programme which lasted seven hours. The British planes received the greatest ovation of the day from an audience of 215,000 when they made their appearance nearly at the end of the programme. They gave their display after the nov/est types of American fighters and bombers, some making their first public appearance, had made a mass fly-over. Pour Royal Navy flyers, led by Acting Lieutenant- Commander D.B, Law, D.S.C., R.N., gave a 15-minute demonstration of precision flying demonstrating manoeuvrability at speed. At a height of only 20 feet they looped and rolled in tight formation. A twin-engined Sea Hornet, with one engine cut out, flew upside- down at only 150 feet. The Navy flyers then demonstrated synchronised flying by taking off in two planes simultaneously but in opposite directions from the same runway. The audience included President Truman and the chiefs of the American Fighting Forces, and an amusing commentary was given by Commander F.H.E. Hopkins, D.S.O., D.S.C., R.N., A.N.A..(Air) Washington. No. 806 Squadron is now taking part in the Canadian National Exhibition at Toronto until September 11th. This is the first time that a Squadron of the Royal Navy has taken part in this exhibition, which is the biggest annual exhibition held in Canada. It attracts people from all parts of the Dominion and some parts of the United States, and normally has a daily attendance exceeding a quarter of a million. Rear-Admiral The Mackintosh of Mackintosh, C.B., D.S.O., D.S.C., Vice-Controller Air and Chief of Naval Air Equipment, has congratulated the Squadron on an 'exceptionally fine and polished display' in New York, his message adding 'You made a profound impression on 200,000 people who saw your show.' HEAVY 'UNITS PREPARE FOR SEA . H.M.S. VANGUARD TO VISIT MALTA . As the Summary goes to press H.M.S. VANGUARD is sailing from Devonport for trials and a 'working up' cruise in the Mediterranean in preparation for the Royal cruise to Australia and New Zealand next year. The ship, commanded by Captain F.R. Parham, D.S.O., R.N., has been recently recommissioned after a refit and is now Devonport manned. She will be carrying out the usual trials after recommiss ioning, will enter Weymouth Bay on September 3rd and will sail from Portland on September 11th for Gibraltar.■■■IVarious exercises will be carried out from Gibraltar, and on October 1st the VAKGUARD will sail icr Malta, where she is expected, to arrive on October Mth to carry out further exercises. The ship is expected to arrive back in plynouth on November 12th. HOME FLEET READY FOR VifBST IN DIES VISIT „ Meanwhile units of ^the Home Fleet are making final preparations for their Autumn cruise and when they sail from Portland in September they will take part in a combined naval and air exercise in the English Channel and South Western Approaches. The exercise will be during the first three days of the passage (September 23rd, 24th and 25th) as the fleet heads towards the Atlantic. The naval units, some of which will be bound for the Vest Indies and others for South Africa, will include the battleshin, H.M.3. DUKE OF YORK (wearing the flag of the Commander- in-Chief Home Fleet. Vice-Admiral Sir hhodcrick R. McGrigor, K.C.B., D.S.O.); the fleet carrier, H.M.S. ILLUSTRIOUS; the light fleet carriers, H.M.S. THESEUS (wearing the flag of ear- Admiral M. J. Mansergh, C.B., C.B.E.) and H.M.S. VENGEANCE; the cruisers, H.M.S. DIADEM (wearing the flag of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Guy H.E, Russell, C.B,, G.B.n., D.S.O.), H.M.S, CLEOPATRA and H.M.S. SIRIUS; and more than a dozen destroyers and auxiliary vessels. Submarines detailed by the Flag Officer Submarines (Rear-Admiral G. Grantham, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O.); motor torpedo boats from their base, H.M.S. HORNET in the Solent; aircraft of the Royal Air Force including Lancasters of R.A.F. Coastal Command and Lincolns of R.A.F. Bomber Command; and naval^air craft under the command of the Flag Officer Air (Home), Vice- Admiral R.H. Portal, C.B., D.S.C., will also take part. The exercise will be in four phases designed primarily to exercise the defences of the Fleet against attack by aircraft, submarines and motor torpedo boats; secondly to exercise air craft, submarines and motor torpedo boats in locating and attack ing a*screened naval force; and thirdly to exercise two surface forces in a daylight encounter. A section of the Fleet to be known as the Red^Force will be commanded and controlled by the Oommander-in-Ghief, Home Fleet, in the DUKE OF YORK. A Blue Force will be under the command of the Commander-in-Chief, Plynouth, (Admiral Sir Robert L. Burnett, K.C.B., K.B.E., D.S.O., LL,D.) and the Air Officer Commanding No, 19 Group, R.A.F. Plymouth (Air Vice-Marshal F.L. Hopps, C.B., C.B.E.). In one of the four phases Rear-Admiral the Hon. Guy H.E. Russel]., in HALS. DIADEM, will command Blue Naval Force, H.M.S. ILLUSTRIOUS and some of the smaller craft taking part are not included in the cruise programme. They will return to home ports at the conclusion of the exercise.R.N, COLLEGE, DARTfvlOU T H. W/iH IMORI/iL . Enquiries from many parents, relatives and friends of the 529 ex-Dartmouth cadets and staff who lost their lives during the 1939-45 War, as to what opportunities there will^he of presenting some kind of memorial to the College, indicate that it would he the wish of all who have in any way been connected with Dartmouth, that there should he a suitable general memorial. Since the College was opened in 1907 more than 6,700 cadets have been trained at Dartmouth, 747 of whom passed through the College during the war years from 1939-1945. There is therefore a very considerable interest in the College throughout the country and, accordingly, it has been decided that the memorial should take the form of: (1) 'A Book of Remembrance' containing the names of those who lost their lives on active service during the war 01 1939-45&gt; similar to that which was made after the 191 4-1 ^ war, now in the College Chapel, (2) The redecoration and extension of the Chapel lobby so that it may form a suitable setting for those two Books of Remembrance, and a permanent visible memorial for past members of the College who lost their lives during the two wars. (3) A Fund to help, where necessary, in the education of children of cx- Cadets of the College who have been killed, have died, or become permanently disabled v/hile on active service, so that they may have the education which their fathers would have wished. It is intended to compile the Book of Remembrance immediately, to proceed with plans for the redecoration and extension of the Chapel lobby as soon as funds permit, and to place ary further money received into the Special Fund. The administration of the Fund will be undertaken by Trustees, assisted by the Commanding Officer and the Headmaster of the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. Subscriptions in the form of donations or payments by Bankers* Order or of payments under a Deed of Covenant should be made out to the Royal Naval College Dartmouth War Memorial fund and sent to chc Commanding Officer of the Royal Naval College, who will acknowledge all money received. H 0 M E FURTHER TRIALS OF CAS TURBINE CRAFT . powered b 3 r the Gatric gas turbine unit and two conventional engines, His Majesty’s Motor Gunboat 2009 (Lieutenant-Commander C.H. Read, R.N.) underwent successful full speed trials in the^ Solent on July 1st. This was the beginning of the second series of trials of the first gas turbine to bo installed in a seagoing craft.M.G.B. 2009 covered a measured distance at a speed exceeding 34 knots, which is regarded as satisfactory for a craft of her size and type; dirrprovements to the G-atric since the first series of trials last year (including a redesigned compressor) having resulted in a slight increase in speed. The aim of the experiments, however, is to discover how gas turbine machinery stands to marine conditions; had the object been to achieve a speed record for coastal craft a hull of different design and a different machinery arrangement would have been devised. Some of Britain's foremost industrial engineers, Naval engineer Officers and other Admiradty exports were on board the gunboat, which made a series of 6 runs at maximum cruising pov/er and two runs at full power with all three engines running. Towards the end of July the M.G.B. entered the Thames and came alongside the Speaker's Steps at Westminster in order to give Members of both Houses of Parliament a chance to board and inspect her. To test the durability of the propulsion unit, it is necessary for it to run at least 300 to 400 hours. The cruise from the Solent to the Thames was the first to be undertaken by the experimental craft any distance from her base. BFJ,LS OF FAMOUS SHIPS FOR SAME. The bells of famous warships are being offered for sale by the Director of Stores, admiralty. A further list of more than 400 includes two bells from H.M.S, AJAX and one from H.M.S. AGHIIXES - cruisers of the Battle of the plate fame - and one from the battleship H.M.S. ANSON. One of the bells of the AJAX weighs 148 lbs. and may be purchased for £10; it is completely serviceable. Other bells are in various states of repair; some clapperless some cracked, but each with a long record of service. They are priced between £1 and £10, The bells may be bought by Naval personnel and civilians but preference in allocation will be given to officers having special claims for consideration, such as service in a ship to which a bell belonged. Applications including details of special claims, should be made to the Director of Stores, Admiralty, S.W.1. not later than September 30th, 1948, but should not be accompanied by cheques. It is expected that the number of applications will be large and that in view of this, allocations are unlikely to be made for some months after the closing date. It is unlikely that moio than one bell will be allocated to each successful applicant.8 srjr) ~ M type like float has a mt , a new type of life saving gear, incorporating a circular rubber float, and tent, is to be given sea trials by the Navy shortly. It has been developed by a standing Admiralty committee formed to deal with the design and material aspects of survival of these adrift at sea after being forced to abandon ship. The medical aspect is being constantly studied by a special sub-committee of the R.N. Personnel Research Committee, As a result of investigations it lias been deemed necessary to provide floats giving the occupants a dry seat, and better protection from the weather vhiich they do not get in a Carley raft. The float, known as type J.S. , is a develop ment of the J. type aircraft dinghy. Then inflated it resembles a huge motor tyre fitted with a rubberised fabric floor and covered by a tent. An inflated cushion provides a dry seat insulated from the cold temperature of the sea. Other features are a container for food and water, visual and Radar aids to location, a baler, sponge, paddles, a drogue, and a bellows for inflating the cushions and topping up buoyancy chambers. The radar aid is a ref lector at the head of the telescopic mast. The float is designed to provide shelter for ten men and will support them if’ only half inflated. It is normally stowed in a deflated state in a valise, along with the equipment mentioned above, the total weight being 200 lbs. and the stowage space required only 3 ft. x 2 ft. x 1 ft. 6 ins. The float is inflated by pulling a lanyard which releases carbon dioxide from a bottle. As it exparks, the float rips open the valise and the gear is ready for use in a few seconds, A float of this type requires more maintenance than a Gar ley raft and this problem will be investigated when a number of the new type floats are issued, shortly, to selected ships for trial and report. ADMIRALTY T O P RODUCE fOLC' jRRD CHARTS,. Admiralty Chart &gt; which, with their sombrely etched appearance, have guided m.iriners for centuries, are to have added colour, at least in the case of those in greater demand. Colour has hitherto been restricted to spotting the lights in magenta, but in the new style charts, large blue washes v/ill indicate shoal waters and black stippling gives the land a pale grey appearance. The Hydrographer of the Navy decided a year ago to produce two charts on this scheme as an experiment, in order to test sea opinion. Reports received have been favourable and it has now been decided to go .head with the colouring of some 30 of the more popular charts. In the Admiralty's service to navigators, both naval and mercantile, the colouring of charts is just one of the improvements which have been mare possible by the on tiding of the Hydrographic Supplies Establishment, completed at Taunton in 1941. In this Establishment are prepared all charts supplied to the Royal Navy and in addition some 1, ')00,000 were last year sold to merchantmariners and others interested throughout the world. This figure compares with 897,000 sold in 1937. Last year’s takings amounted to some ,€200,000, about one quarter of which was for aborted charts sold through depots and agents in foreign countries. It can now be stated that the Taunton Establishment incorporates one of the largest and most efficient lithographic plants in the world. Air conditioned throughout, the establish ment houses large offset rotary presses, extensive drawing and engraving offices, a litho-photographic room containing among other cameras one 36 ft, in length, and machinery for putting a matt surface on the zinc plates which are the basic essential in modern lithoprinting. * These machines consist of flat baths which oscillate and so cause thousands of glass marbles to jump up and down on the face of the zinc plates. While charts which are required urgently are produced by photo-lithography directly, all charts are put on a basic plate of copper or enamelled zinc. There are some 6,000 stored in the establishment. Many of the copper plates are 100 years old and one of them dates back to 1817 and is still in use. AH the plates are brought up to date constantly as a result of marine surveying by Admiralty Survey Ships. A new method has been evolved for making major alterations on the copper plates. Formerly part of the plate was cut away and a piece of copper introduced; now a deposit of copper is thrown over the face of the plate to prepare it for alteration. STOIARIKE’S ’’SHORTING-’’ CRUISE THE AMBUSH IF ARCTIC GAMES . The submarine PMBUSH returned to port Edgar, in the Firth of Forth, on March 18th, following her experimental ’snorting* cruise in the Arctic. She was at sea for five weeks and was submerged for most of this time. Salt-encrusted, and v/ith rust showing in many places on her hull where the sea had eaten away her paint, she broke surface off May Island and later passed under the Forth Bridge to her berth. Her commanding Officer (Lieutenant A.G-. Davies, D.S.C., R.N,) said on arrival that at one time the weather forced him to surface for three days and ’’just roll it out, hove to” in the worst weather in his 11 years’ experience at sea. The ship was close to the ice-pack. Navigation was difficult because they could not get a star sight and during the short period when they did surface, the skies were cloudy and the horizon bad. They did not know their position correctly for nearly three weeks. The navigating officer developed a septic hand and an operation had to be performed under general anaesthetic while the ship was submerged. During the storm the ere// load to lash them selves in their bunks while off duty, and those on duty secured themselves on the bridge with ropes.10 Lieutenant Davies also said that they were discouraged at the start hy a main engine defect which necessitated putting into the Faroes, Fortunately the ship f s staff were able to carry out the repairs and they continued the patrol after about 2.1+ hours. They saw ice and v/ere among it on two occasions. After that he made every endeavour not to encounter it again as 'it is not pleasant. We rolled so .much that none of our instruments was able to record the degree of roll/ he added. 'Even under the surface we had been rolling 15 beg. either side of the vertical. The normal roll submerged is nil.” But throughout it all, the morale of the ship’s company was extremely high. Most wore seasoned submariners, but they were not specially picked for the job. The food was good and they did not even have to issue vitamin tablets. THREE WRENS, A THIEF AND A ROLLING PIN . Vice-Admiral E.R. Archer, G.B., G.B.E., Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland, lias commended three W.R.N.S. Gooks for catching a thief with the aid of a rolling pin. The Wrens are Petty Officer Wren E. Kelly, Wren G.K. Anderson and Wren A. Hiller, all of H.M.S. SEA EAGLE, a Naval Aviation Establishment near Londonderry. petty Officer 'Wren Kelly, in charge of the Main Galley in H.M.S. SEA EAGLE, had for some time suspected pilfering of the larder stores. Acting on their own initiative, in order to clear the W.R.N.S. cooks of suspicion, she and the two Wrens made fast all doors and windows to the Main Galley late at night and locked themselves in the larder. In this confined space they waited in the dark until the small hours when footsteps were heard, a key was inserted in the door, and the door opened. The intruder was struck with a rolling pin and detained while the Petty Officer of the Guard was summoned. The W.R.N.S. ratings concerned were all of slight build, and had no knowledge of the number or character of the suspected thieves.* WUMMiftKiMnr.ar INDIA OFFICE FIECOF^DS MICROFILM</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000184_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/341</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000184</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/341</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/50 Staff Officer (Intelligence) East Indies: Periodic Newsletter'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1948/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-05T21:11:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (56 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged chronologically.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 58; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains periodic newsletters written by J E M Ruffer, Staff Officer (Intelligence) at the East Indies Station, Naval Headquarters, Trincomalee.
