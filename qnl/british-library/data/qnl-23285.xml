NOTICE No. 20^7 Shah Allum Shoal - Buoy established Northward. Position:- Close northward of the Shoal, Lat. 26° 25' 45 M N,, long. 52° 30' 4.5' E. Description:- Spherical buoy # painted red. (Notice No.2087 of 17-6-1946.) Charts affected:- Nos. 2830.-2837A - 2837B. Publication:- Persian Gulf Pilot, 1942, page 140. Authority:- East Indies Hyd. Notice N0.ll /i946, (H. 3100/46,) /L a*) (Revised November, 1946) THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf INFORMATION FOR OWNERS, CHARTERERS AND MASTERS OF VESSELS PROCEEDING BAHREIN OIL TERMINAL TO LOAD. BUNKER OR DISCHARGE FREIGHT. This information and the accompanying Mooring Layout (Drawing No. BRC-3041-0) has been prepared for the purpose of acquainting those concerned with the terminal facilities, general conditions and availability of supplies, etc., at Sitra Anchorage and Wharves, Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf. Generally speaking all services, etc. available through Company facilities or em ployees are for the use of tankers nominated to load at Bahrein, freighters or other vessels bunkering at Bahrein, and freighters discharging or loading cargo primarily for Company account. CAUTION : The Layout Drawing is not intended as a navigational chart and should not be used as such. Masters should obtain the latest British Admiralty charts of the region and the latest 'Notices to Mariners'. The 'Persian Gulf Pilot', with supplements, published for the British Admiralty by H.M.'s Stationery Office, will be found helpful and informative. Mariners are also cautioned to keep well clear of Shah Allum Shoal which lies approximately 83 miles to the eastward of Bahrein Lightship. This shoal is not marked either by buov or light.- 2 - INDEX 1. Channel from Lightship to Moorings. 2. Anchorage. 3. Terminal Facilities. 4.

CHANNEL FROM LIGHTSHIP TO MOORINGS Th e channel from the lightship to the moorings is weil marked and easily navigable in clear weather during daylight hours, but owing to the irregular currents and dust haze, which forms rapidly, mariners should check position as often as cir cumstances permit, utilizing the various aids to maintain mid- channel position. Reference to the layout will show that the channel is marked by three lighted aids; the lightship (26° 33' 30' N 50° 58' E), North or Outer Sitra Light Buoy (26° 21' 30' N 50° 50' 00' E), and South Sitra Light Buoy (26° 10' 30' N 50° 44' 00' E), as well as Middle Sitra, (26° 16' 00' N 50° 46' 00' E), an unlighted conical buoy situated one mile west of mid—channel. Ordinarily two lighted aids are visible at all times. There is* also a light buoy situated about six miles north of Muharraq Island. In clear weather this light will be visible before the Lightship is lost and will still be visible after South Sitra Light Buoy has been picked up. By using this additional light, mariners may obtain a 'fix' to check their position after dark, when Middle Sitra Nun Buoy may not be sighted. Since the light ship is unattended, mariners should, before starting into the channel, insure that it is in its correct position with relation to the watch buoy which is located one mile due west of the lightship. The lightship is painted red and carries the word BAHREIN painted in white on both sides, but after a sand storm the red may appear as grey. The distance from the lightship to South Sitra Light Buoy is approximately 26 miles. Minimum water depth in this channel is six (6) fathoms. All of the above men tioned aids to navigation appear on British Admiralty charts for this locality which have been issued since 1934. NOTE: It is possible that Middle Sitra Nun Buoy may be changed in the near future to a Light Buoy and the range of South Sitra Light will be increased but at date of issue these changes have not been effected. Without accepting any responsibility, the follow ing suggestions are made by our Marine Staff for the benefit of Masters who have not previously entered Sitra Anchorage: 1st If unfamiliar with the approaches do not attempt navigation in these waters at night. 2nd The Bahrein Light Vessel should be sighted. If, because of poor visibility or other rea son, the Light Vessel is not sighted the Master should stop or anchor until the position of his vessel is checked by radio bearings from shore and by soundings.5rd The Light Vessel should be passed close on the ships starboard side and the vessel steered straight for the North Sitra Light Buoy. When passing the Light Vessel it should be noted which direction she has swung on her anchor in order to determine tide direction. The tide will be setting on ship's beam and some al lowance in course may be necessary to correct for tidal drift. 4th Pass North Sitra Light Buoy close on ship's starboard and if proper correction has been made for tide no difficulty will be experienced in sighting Middle Sitra Dumb Buoy and South Sitra Light Buoy. Pass both of these on the ship's starboard side with about jr mile clearance. 5th One mile, nearly west, from South Sitra Light Buoy is a White Spar, as a marker on the end of the Bank. If a Mooring Master has not met the vessel, proceed to anchorage between this Spar and the Company's Old (Island) Wharf. NOTE: It is possible that changes will be made to the aids to Sitra Anchorage and that the North and South Spar Buoys will be replaced by Lighted Markers. 2. ANCHORAGE If it is necessary or desirable to anchor before or after loading, an anchorage in about 8 fathoms, with good holding ground, will be found to the eastward of the Old (Island) Wharf, as shown on BA Chart 3790 and on the Mooring Layout. Sitra Anchorage is an 'open' anchorage, available to all ships calling at Bahrein, but it is again emphasized that, with few exceptions, the use of Company facilities, buoys, wharves, tugs, etc., is restricted to such vessels as tankers loading bulk cargoes, vessels taking fuel or diesel bunkers, and freighters loading or discharging cargo for Company account. 3. TERMINAL FACILITIE S Sitra Loading Terminal is located about 3 miles east from Sitra Island, as shown on the Mooring Layout, and consists of:- 5 - ( ( a ) The Old Island Wharf (No. 1 Wharf) with facilities for berthing two tankers or freighters for bunkers. Load ing to both vessels may be simultaneous providing cargo loaded is of different grades, i.e. it is rarely pos sible to load one stock to two vessels simultaneously. The usual safety rules must be observed, particularly in regard to the prohibition of Smoking and Open Fires. See also Section #13 - Responsibility. (b) The New Wharf (No. 2 Wharf) which is 1100 feet long forming a 'T' to the pier extending from Sitra Causeway has facilities for berthing four ships, two on the Eastward or outside and two on the Westward or inside. Loading of vessels may proceed simultaneously providing cargoes concerned lend themselves to the use of differ ent lines and pumps. As with the Old Wharf the usual safety practices must be observed but for further detail on this subject refer to Section #13. (c) The Refinery which is located on Bahrein Island about 3 miles inland from Sitra Island is not shown on the Mooring Layout. (d) Laboratories for testing stocks, together with tele phones for communication ashore are located on both Wharves. NOTE : Both Wharves are considered 'open roadstead' and vessels cannot be furnished with steam, air or other facilities such as are generally furnished at a 'closed roadstead' port. 4. MOORING AND BERTHING VESSELS AT TERMINAL This section refers only to vessels (tankers, freighters or Navy Vessels) with which the Company is concerned, i.e. tankers loading at Bahrein, freighters or Navy Vessels bunkering at Bahrein, and freighters discharging or loading cargo for Company account. (a) Incoming vessels whose Masters have previously visited this port are boarded by Company Mooring Masters in Sitra Anchorage. However, on radio request, arrange ments can be made for a Mooring Master to meet the vessel off South Sitra Light Buoy from which point he will act in an advisory capacity to the Master in pro ceeding to Sitra Anchorage, and later mooring, berthing or placing the vessel to the Company Mooring Buoy. Upon completion of operations the Mooring Master will assist in departure from berth or moorings and again.if requested, will advise the Master until arrival at South Sitra Light Buoy. Vessels will be held liable for any damages occurring through improper or poor mooring ropes or inability to properly handle same. Mooring lines can be supplied from ashore when required, at a rental charge of $25.00 per line, to be included in the Voyage Account. Twenty four (24) hours notice must be given, but it cannot be guaranteed that lines will be delivered promptly on a vessel's arrival. A flat charge totalling Rs.75/-/- will be levied to cover the services we render in running ropes during both operations of berthing and unberthing of vessels. Should the Master so desire, the assistance of a Com pany tug is available. The minimum rate of hire per tug for berthing, unberthing or turning self-propelled vessels, whether or not making use of their own power, is: Base period of l-§- hours or any part thereof Rs.200/—MINIMUM Time in excess of base period of l-J hours Rs.200/—PER HOUR The minimum rate of hire per tug for services other than berthing, unberthing or turning self-propelled vessels, whether or not making use of their own power, is: Base period of 2j hours or any part thereof Rs. 500/—MINIMUM Time in excess of base period of 2j hours Rs.200/—PER HOUR Berthing at No. 1 (Old) Wharf Ships moor with one anchor down, (75 to 100 fathoms usually) and with a line to each of 3 mooring buoys, located respectively on the bow, beam and stern and 2 breastlines to the wharf. Berthing at No. 2 (New) Wharf Vessels berthing alongside the New Wharf must be equipped with three ropes and one wire forward and three ropes and one wire aft. Method of berthing will be at the discretion of the Mooring Master as weather and other conditions permit.It (d) Mooring at Buoy With six berths available it is unlikely that freight ers for Company account will require to load or dis charge in the Anchorage. However, should this be nec essary a Company Mooring Buoy is available in order to preserve a lee side in all states of weather. Both anchors are let go forward and the stern secured to the Mooring Buoy, 5. PORT REGULATIONS This section details some of the more important port requirements, but Masters should refer to their Ship's Agent for any other information concerning port regulations not in cluded herein. (a) This port is not classed as a 'plague port' and vac cination is not required. Very infrequently mosquitoes are found at Sitra Anchorage. Pratique, Customs en trance and clearance are all granted at the Anchorage and Masters need not go to Manama for this purpose. (b) Masters of vessels loading at Bahrein are advised that this port is considered an 'open roadstead', and that under no circumstances may they instruct or allow ships' engines to be immobilized for repair or other reason whilst their vessel is alongside either Wharf. Should any repairs be required that involve the dis mantling of engines, such work must be carried out at the anchorage before or after loading. It is emphas - sized that all vessels alongside either Wharf must be in condition to clear from the Wharves immediately on instruction to do so . (c) By ruling of the Government of Bahrein ships' personnel and passengers are not allowed to land in Bahrein with out special permission . Certain exceptions have been granted, namely, (1) Masters and Chief Engineers on ships' business, providing proper arrangements have been made by contact with Bahrein Petroleum Company's Shipping Office (Telephone 27) or Ship's Agents, (2). Personnel requiring medical attention (see Regulation No. 11). It should be noted that invitations from residents in Bahrein to Ships' personnel to proceed ashore are in valid and such invitations must not be accepted . (d) Under no circumstances should liquor be given to natives. This ruling applies to all Bahreinis, Arabs,\1&gt; - 8 - Persians, Iraqis or Indians resident in Bahrein whether or not they are Company employees. (e) No Port Charges are levied by the Government of Bahrein other than Stamp Duty on the Port Clearance and Customs duty on certain items of import. The importation of fire-arms or implements of war of any kind is pro hibited. (f) Ballast Disposal The water adjacent to Bahrein Island must not be pol luted with oil and vessels are requested to avoid pumping dirty ballast water overboard when within 50 miles of the Island, because of the pearl and other fisheries in this vicinity. It is suggested that ves sels arrive with minimum ballast and clean such tanks and also flush pipelines as may be required while en- route in order that the remaining ballast may be clean and can then be unquestionably pumped overboard at the Anchorage. At Bahrein there are no facilities for receiving slop ashore, and vessels must arrive with clean ballast otherwise they will be requested to proceed to sea for discharge. Cleaning and gas-freeing of tanks enroute will save considerable time at the loading port as this must in most instances be done in any case before the ship can be accepted as ready to load. (g) On vessels berthing at the New Wharf it is essential that Rat Guards be employed on all ropes. In addition the ship's gangway should be brightly illuminated at night. (h) A Political Agency under the India Office is maintained in Bahrein and, through Ship's Agents, handles all business normally conducted by H.B.M.'s Consul. (i) A U.S.A. Consulate is established at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and the Consul attends the Company Office in Bahrein at weekly intervals. The time of such visits may be obtained by enquiry through the Shipping Office (Telephone No. 27). 6. AGENCY After the vessel is anchored or berthed, a repre sentative of the Ship's Agents will call on board to handle agency. Enquiries for mail should be made to this representative.- 9 - At time of issue Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., Manama, Bahrein, hold most Agencies in Bahrein although the firm of Yusaf bin Ahmed Kanoo has the agency for Silver-Java P^rnfic and a few other lines, 7. RADIO Adv ice of Arri val Masters are requested to radio their arrival time at least 24 hours in advance of arrival. Advice of the earliest possible date would be appreciated. Address BiiPCO through Bahrein Radio Station which operates as under;- SHORT WAVE WATCH Listens for shios on 8280 (36.23) or 12500 (2^.00) Replies to ' ' 8^05 (35.69) or 12590 (23.83) from 0800 to 0900 G.M.T., and 1600 to 1700 G.M.T., daily. ME DIUM W..VE WATCH On 500 Kilocycles (600 meters) from 0300 to 1900 G.M.T. daily. (To be inserted on our 'PORT INFORMATION BOOKLFT', page 9.) S. READINESS TO LOAD As at date of issue most Tankers load under UMAVOIL Charter, the terms of which are similar to those of the Ministry of War Transport Standard War-Time Tanker Voyage Charter Party. Therefore, the following will apply in regard to Notice of Readiness: (a) Notice of Readiness will not be accepted as at time of arrival unless the vessel is in all respects ready to load. (b) Normally Readiness will be accepted as at arrival time plus time taken to discharge water ballast. (c) By terms of the Charter Party Sundays and Holidays are not excluded in computing lay time, and Masters are within their rights in tendering Notice of Readiness to load on such days. Similarly if a vessel is in all respects ready to load, regardless of time or whether berth is or is not available. Readiness will be ac cepted when tendered.- 10 - (d) The situation of the loading berth at Bahrein is such that vessels cannot be held accountable for delays suf fered due to bad weather making berthing impossible. Therefore, weather does not affect acceptance of Notice. For vessels loading under Charter Parties other than the above the particular terms of each charter will apply, which, generally speaking, will result as under: Vessels are not moored during the night, conse quently Notice of Readiness for vessels arriving after 6.00 P.M. will not be accepted until 6.00 A.M., and then only providing vessel is in all respects ready to receive cargo. Notices of Readiness will not be accepted on Holidays or on Fridays, the latter being the weekly day of rest according to local custom and religion. Arrival, where used above, means anchorage at any point West of South Sitra Buoy. 9. LOADING After the vessel is properly moored, the loading hose or hoses will be swung aboard by .a derrick located on the Wharf concerned. A sketch of the flange for this hose, giving the bolt circle and dimensions, is shown in the lower left hand corner of the Mooring Layout Plan. For convenience, vessels should have fittings conforming to this template or provide adapters or connectors that will do so. This however, is not mandatory, but expedites connecting and guarantees a good connection. The Mooring Master supervises the connecting of the hose, and after loading is completed, supervises the dis connecting. Loading will not commence until the ship's loading officer reports the ship ready for loading, and the Mooring Master is fully satisfied with the connections and preparations for loading. The Mooring Master controls all communications with shore via the Company telephone system. Vessels which are to load mixed cargoes may be asked to load two or more products simultaneously, and unless lines are fitted so that there are two block valves between products to prevent contamination, blinds must be inserted for this purpose.11 - 11 - . . The Company Mooring Master will remain aboard dur ing the loading and he will advise the Master concerning the loading procedure and loading hazards, but will not direct the loading of the vessel unless the loading methods endanger the teimmal facilities. Proper setting and manipulation of ship's lines and valves is the responsibility of the ship's personnel as outlined m Section #13. CAUTION: Warning is given of the danger of closing a valve against the incoming oil stream. This procedure will create excessive pressures which may result in damage to the hose, ship's piping, or terminal facilities. Vessels will be held liable for damages resulting from failure to observe this precaution. 10. SUPPLIES AMD PROVISIONS Fresh water delivery service is available to ves sels loading or bunkering at Sitra wharves. There is a delivery charge of Rs.2/—/— per ton. Vessels not loading or bunkering but requesting this service may, if a berth or bunkering vessel is available, be serviced at an additional delivery charge of Rs. 100/-/-. Masters should read the current analysis of the water on the reverse of the official receipt before requesting this service. As at date of issuance analysis of the water available at No. 1 (Island) wharf is approxiately as under: Temp. Hardness at CaC03. Perm. ' ' ' Calcium ' ' CaCa Chloride ' NaCl Magnesium ' Mg Sulphate ' SO4 Silica ' Si02 Aluminum ' AI2O3 Total Iron ' Fe Total Solids at 105 o C. pH Value p.p.m M fl II II II II II II II 175 675 238 1,550 29 450 22 5 1 2,685 7.5 It is expected that on completion of the water well on No. 2 New Wharf the analysis will be substantially the same as above. Fuel Oils Boiler Fuel Oil and Diesel Oil may be obtained either direct from the shore lines or from a bunkering barge, when latter is available. Bunkers can be loaded simultaneously with bulk cargo.- 12 - 1—1 Before commencement of bunkering. Chief Engineers can elect to send a representative ashore to gauge and inspect the oil in our shore tanks. A shore representative, will be pleased to show that all valves except those leading to the vessel are closed on the bunkering line. Marine Lubricants A full line of Texaco Marine Lubricants and Greases, as under, is carried at Bahrein: Diesel Cylinder Oils (Various Types) Diesel Crankcase Oils (Various Types) Turbine Oils Marine Engine Oils Steam Cylinder Oils (Various Types) Stern Tube Oils Tunnel Bearing Grease Air Compressor Oils Refrigerator Oils (Various Types) Compound for Exposed Gears, Wire Rope, etc. Cup Greases Dynamo Oil Texacoat - Protective coating for decks and exposed surfaces. Foodstuffs Under normal conditions good fish is available and fair quality of beef and mutton may be had on due notice by radio to the Agents. Fresh vegetables and dry stores are not available. Deck and Engine Room Spares None available at Bahrein. Repairs There are no repair facilities on the Island other than those of the Refinery and routine marine repair work cannot be undertaken. In case of essential repairs the Company will en deavor to do all possible to enable the vessel to sail. Laundry The only laundry available is by 'dhobi'. This is not recommended due to class of v/ork and the possibility of theft. However, if it is desired to use this service the matter should be taken up with the Ship's Agents.- 13 - 11. HOSPITAL FACILITIES a (9 Emergency hospital cases will be treated as such and will be handled by the Ship's Agent or by Company facilities, whichever is first available. Under normal conditions, however, ' 5 shoul d handle all personnel from ships 12. CLIMATE AND WEATHER CONDITIONS The weather at Bahrein is similar to that ex perienced in other parts of the Gulf, and similar precautions should be taken, especially regarding sun and heat stroke in the summer months. The shamal or prevailing wind is from the north west, at rare intervals reaching gale force. There is little or no ground swell at the moorings, but during a heavy shamal, a heavy short sea makes up that is bothersome to small boats. 13. RESPONSIBILITY (a) Limitation of Liability The furnishing of pilots, mooring masters, towboats, launches or anything done in connection therewith shall not be construed to be or give rise to a personal con tract, and it is understood that The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited and/or Affiliates, and any vessel they may furnish, and their owners, charterers, operators, managers, and agents, shall have the benefit of all exemptions from and limitations of liability to which an owner of a vessel is entitled, under the Limitation of Liability Statutes of the United States. (b) Pilotage When the Captain of any tug furnished to or engaged in the service of assisting a vessel which is making use of her own propelling power, goes on board such vessel, or any other pilot or mooring master goes on board such vessel, it is to be understood and agreed that such tugboat Captain or pilot or mooring master becomes the servant of the owner of the vessel assisted in respect to the giving of orders to any of the tugs furnished to or engaged in the assisting service and in respect to the handling of such vessel, and neither those furnish ing the tugs and/or pilot nor the tugs, their owners, agents, charterers, operators, or managers, shall be liable for any damage resulting therefrom.With respect to vessels that are not owned by the per son or company ordering the launch service or pilotage it is to be understood and agreed that such person or company warrants that it has authority to bind the vessel owner to all the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, and agrees to indemnify and hold The Bahrein Petroleum Company and/or Affiliates harmless and also those furnishing the tugs and/or pilot, the tugs, their ov/ners, agents, charterers, operators and managers, from all damages and expenses that may be sustained or increased in the event and in consequence of such person or company not having such authority. ( c ) Fire Prevention Tanker personnel are normally aware of safety regula tions enforced at Oil V/harves but for the information of all others using the Company facilities it is em phasized that Smoking and Open Fires are prohibited on the Wharves or on vessels alongside or within 200 yards of either V/harf. Further, each vessel's personnel is responsible for the safety of its own ship at all times. (d) Vessels will be held liable for any damages occurring through improper or poor mooring ropes or inability to properly handle same. (e) Prohibited Anchorage Due to the presence of pipe and power lines, anchoring is prohibited 50 yards on each side of a line from the center of Old Wharf to the center of Cathodic House and Causeway.

The 'Oil in Navigable waters Act 1922' imposes penalties for fouling ceratin waters but it has not been applied here, and until we receive a copy we do not know whether the territorial waters of the Persian Gulf are among those specified in the Act.

Incidentally, unless my office is very muc^at -avilt, we have never received any copies of the re S ul ; ; ations issued in Bahrain under the Persian Cruli otates (Emergency) Order-in-Council, 1939, I think a mutual exchange of legislation in future would be benificial.

His Britannic Majesty^s Political Agent, The Agency, MANAMA, Bahrein. File No. 6^9 Dear Sir, Please refer to your letter No. C/709 of the 19th June, 1947 on the question of enacting certain legislation in Bahrein to protect its shores and waters from pollution by spillage of oil I have carefully reviewed the copy of 'Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1922', which you kindly attached to your above mentioned letter and offer the following comments for your consideration. Section 2 'Prohibition of Transfer of Oil at Night'. This section is not in agreement with recognized modern practice in the world's ports for as far as I can determine any restriction against night operations which the odd port used to enforce have been eliminated in recent years. Further in this connection any restriction on night operations in Sitrah Harbour would be untenable as the Company must main tain a 24 hour operating schedule. Section 4 'Liquid Contained in Spaces used for Carriage of Oil to be Deemed Oil for Purposes of Act'. This paragraph appears to require some clarification as to how the tanks should be cleaned; i.e. by scraping, Butterworthing etc. For safety at sea every tanker must carry some ballast in tanks used for transporting bulk oil cargo, and the act makes it the responsibility of the Master to insure that this ballast is clean before discharging in port. There fore, if the ballast is clean we can assume that the tanks have been properly cleaned prior to loading ballast without demanding proof from the Master. Except for the two sections noted above the Act does not appear either unreasonable or impractical, however, to date we have had no difficulty in this regard as all Masters realize the seriousness of water pollution and have cooperated with olie Company 1 s representatives in returning to sea for tank cleaning upon request.No. C/PA -295. -2- 27th July, 194-7. For your further information on this subject I am attaching a copy of the Company^ 'Port Information Booklet' which is handed to each Master calling at Sitra Anchor age. You will note that the subject of water pollution is covered on page 8, paragraph F.

Reference your Memorandum No.1038-S, dated the 30th May, 1947, the copy of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1922, is returned herewith. The matter has been discussed with the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain petroleum Company, Limited, and his comments on the Act with which I agree are as follows:- 'Section 2 'Prohibition of Transfer of Oil at Night ! . This section is not in agreement with recognized modern practice in the worlds ports for as far as I can determine any restriction against night operations which the odd port used to enforce have been eli minated in recent years. Further in this connection any restriction on night opera tions in Sitra Harbour would be untenable as the Company must maintain a 24 hour operating schedule. Section 4 ♦Liquid Contained in Spaces used for Carriage of Oil to be Deemed Oil for purposes of Act 1 . This paragraph appears to require some clarification as to how the tanks should • be cleaned; i.e. by scraping. Butter- worthing etc. For safety at sea every tanker must carry some ballast in tanks used for transporting bulk oil cargo, and the act makes it the responsibility of the Master to insure that this ballast is clean before discharging in port. Therefore, if the ballast is clean we can assume that the tanks have been properly cleaned prior to loading ballast without demanding proof from the Master^. 2. There has, to date, been no apparent necessity for the application of the Act to Bahrain as the Bahrain Petroleum Company already takes adequate measures to prevent the pollution of the Bahrain shores and waters from oil, vide page 8, paragraph F of the Company's Port Information Booklet attached. It seems desirable, however, that there should be legal sanction for the enforcement of disciplinary measures should they ever be required, and I suggest, therefore, that the Act should be applied to Bahrain subject to the modifications suggested by the Company.

Dear Sir, The Company wishes me to report that on the morning of November 6th, 194-7 a quantity of oil was reported to be on the water east and south of the Company's old island loading wharf. During the rest of the day the Company's Refinery Manager, Mr. C. R. Barkhurst, along with other interested parties, conducted a diligent search in an effort to trace the source of the oil without any con clusive results. However, they did find oil around the U.S. Navy vessel 'Caloosahatche'* which was loading fuel oil and questioned the master and other officers regarding same. The ship's officers disclaimed all knowledge and responsibility for the oil on the water. On completion of the loading of the above ^ mentioned tanker, it was found that her cargo was some 9,000 barrels short of the quantity loaded from the shore tanks and, under the circumstances, the Company's officials can only assume that this vessel was the source of the oil. The Master was given a letter to this effect, even though the ship's officers continued to disclaim responsibility. On the morning of November 8th, 194-7? the Company chartered a light aircraft from the Arabian American Oil Company to further search the area and it is reported by the pilot that there is evidence of oil along the beach on the east side of Bahrein for a distance of approximately five miles south from Sitra Island. The above is for your information should any complaint be registered by residents in villages along this coast line. Chief Local Representative.

File 630.1 Dear Sir: I am desired 'by the Company to advise you of the circum stances involved in an incident resulting in a considerable quantity of fuel oil being discharged from the S/S 'Argofaxf 1 during the night of August 21st, 194S, into the waters of Sitra anchorage. The vessel was alongside the Company's wharf for the pur pose of loading a cargo of package products and the loading had been in progress for several days. At approximately 7:15 p.m., August 21st, the vessel's officers reported a large leakage in its bunker fuel oil system, which was of such proportions that there was danger the boiler room might become flooded with oil, which might have resulted in a serious fire, endangering the vessel, the Company's wharf installations, personnel and other vessels alongside at the time. Therefore, in order to avoid the possibility of an accident which would, no doubt have been of serious consequences, the ship discharged the fuel to the Gulf. The vessel was unberthed to the anchorage, but before the leak could be brought under control, it was evidently necessary to continue pumping fuel oil into the Gulf. The Master of the S/S 'Argofax' has been advised that port regulations strictly prohibit the contamination of the harbour by oil and that we are holding his vessel and/or owners responsible for all consequences of this occurrence. The Company have taken this action for the reason that the necessity for the measures resorted to was the responsibility of the ship. Yours very truly. For R. M.
