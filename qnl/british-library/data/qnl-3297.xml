Also included with this correspondence is a report, possibly to the Governor of Bombay summarising many of the matters discussed in these letters.There is also correspondence with Charles Alison which focuses on the working relationship between the Resident at Bushire and the Persian Authorities and the difficulties that often arose with this around communication.
