British possessions, including the port of Aden and the island of Socotra (ʻAdan and Suquṭrā, both part of present-day Yemen), are indicated by the pink coloring. The old Qatari cities of El Bedaa and Zabara (present-day Al Bida and Al Zabara) are shown. The map appeared as plate 48 in The Imperial Atlas of Modern Geography, published by the Glasgow firm of Blackie &amp; Son in 1859 and reissued in 1860. Founded in 1809 by the Scot John Blackie (1782−1874), by the mid-19th century this firm was an important publisher of illustrated reference works, including The Imperial Gazetteer (1855), The Imperial Atlas of Modern Geography, and The Imperial Bible Dictionary (1866). The map was drawn and engraved by Edward Weller (1819−84), a London-based cartographer and engraver who was the unofficial geographer of the Royal Geographical Society in London. The atlas was compiled under the direction of Walter Graham Blackie (1816−1906), the youngest son of John Blackie.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Arabian Peninsula</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Glasgow</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Red Sea</topic></subject><subject><geographic>United Arab Emirates</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arabian Gulf</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Persian Gulf</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/12885#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
