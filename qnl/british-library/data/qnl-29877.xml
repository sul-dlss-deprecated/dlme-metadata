Unless the Sultan reverts to the subject, I suggest that nothing should be said to him about it. If he does revert to it, I think he must be told as politely as possible that unless he can take steps himself to assert his authority in Masfut, we do not consider it proper for us to restrain Shaikh Rashid from interfering there.

Stobart, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah, to Mr. C.J. Pelly, Political Agent, Bahrain. Will you please refer to your printed letter No.C/s-44, dated the 27th April 1949, re garding the complaint of the Sultan of Muscat about the Shaikh Ajmanis occupation of Masfut. 2. Masfut village which lies in the Hatta region, belonged to Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of Buraimi and was seized by the Shaikh of Ajman in April 1947, vide paragraph 59(ii) of Trucial Coast News Report No.8 of 1947. Shaikh Saqr made no attempt to re capture the village, but asked some Trucial Shaikhs to mediate, and when the failed, he eventually complained to the Sultan of Muscat. The Sultan took up the matter with the Shaikh of Ajman who put him off by false promises of going to Muscat himself and talking to him about it. (paragraph 85 (ii) of Trucial Coast News Report No.12 of 1947 refers). S. The reason why Saqr bin Sultan approached the Sultan of Muscat to interfere in this matter is probably that they were then on good terms tather than that he considered himself to be a subject of the Sultan. Now that Saqr has openly renounced the Sultan’s authority, I do not think the Sultan is justified in requesting our intervention in this matter.CCPY 219/1/49 MaSFUT The Sultan on the 27th March complained that a Shaikh Rashid of iijnam was making a nuisance of himself and requested that he should be asked to stop interfering with the Sultan's tribes. He jfcated that Shaikh Rashid was endeavouring to establish himself in Masfut. Shaikh Rashid actually told me when I visited him in February that the Naim of this place had acknowledged him as their Sheikh but the Sultan says this is not the case. In any case if Masfut is within the territory which we recognise as belonging to the Sultan Shaikh Rashid should I think be warned that he must not interfere there without the Sultan's permission.% - A</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000018_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/249</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000018</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/249</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/64 I Naim Tribe'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-04-19T22:05:02</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (4 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 6; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file concerns a dispute between the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] and Shaikh Rashid of Ajman [Rāshid bin Ḥumaid Āl Nu‘aymī].
