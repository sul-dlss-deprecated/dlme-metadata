HM’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tehran, Percy Loraine, and the (Acting) High Commissioner in Iraq, Bernard Henry Bourdillon, discuss the Persian Government’s desire to facilitate exports in its northern and eastern provinces, in response to Russia's embargo on all goods except cotton from Persia. The correspondence also concerns British-administered Iraq’s desire to encourage greater trade between Iraq and Persia. The file includes: a memorandum dated 2 November 1926 on Persian exports and inland transport, written by the Acting Secretary in Charge of Commercial Affairs at the British Legation in Tehran, Eric Ralph Lingeman (ff 43-46); a report dated 29 June 1931 on the Rawanduz road and other main roads in Azerbaijan, written by the British Consul at Tabriz, Clarence Edward Stanhope Palmer (ff 19-39); a memorandum dated 30 March 1932 on the Rowanduz Rayat road, written by the Director of the Iraq State Railways, Joseph Ramsay Tainsh (ff 10-15).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Iraqi Republic Railways</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Azerbaijan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Rowanduz</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Tabriz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary in Charge of Commercial Affairs, British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Road Transport</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade routes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Railways</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic sanctions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000010#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
