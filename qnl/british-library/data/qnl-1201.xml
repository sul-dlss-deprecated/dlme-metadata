He was appointed Grand Sherif to supersede King Hussein in or about 1917, and was ; in general^run by the Turks as an opposition candidate for that post when the Hashimite family had gone over to the Allies. Naturally however he was unable to take possession of his post. Early in 1926 he tried to obtain the support of His Majesty's Government in obtaining the post of Regent or Governor of the Hejaz under King Ibn Saud. From such correspondence as we have about him, it appears that he was, or claimed to be, on fairly friendly terms Haider (n&lt;§e Miss Dunn), the wife of Sherif Ali Haider, has been passed on to us by the Prince's Private Secretary.

PA LAC’S , S. .1. 82nd January, 1936. Vith the Compliments of the Private Secretary to The Prince of Sales. This communication has not been acknowledged. The Private Secretary, session OFFICE.Private . !h Raz Beirut f Syria# 10th January, 1935. Your Royal Highness, X am the English wife of H#H. the Ex-Amir of Mecca, Sherif All Haider, and I write, unknown to my husband, to ask your help, or advice, in our present difficulties. The Sharif is old and delicate. His health as ~ our doctor, Pr. Khayat of the American Hospital, tells me is precarious. He must have care and he free from worry. Naturally when the Turks lost their Arab lands our government appointments were cut off. The Prince had in addition a share in the family wakifa in Mecca. This owing to the present conditions in Mecca, and the smallness of the Pilgrimage nowadays has been greatly reduced. The whole sum received last year for ten people was not much more than £100 and this again was reduced by exchange. The Prince lives on 150 rupees a month which he receives from H.I.H. the Nazim of Kaiderabad. This sum the Srnir*s life-long friend the last Caliph arranged for him after the marriage of the Caliph’s daughter. * Prince Mejid hoped to obtain a larger sum as Moslems, according to their religion, should contribute one-tenth of their goods to the Prophet's family. Another small sum which the Prince received monthly is 50 dollars from hie son employed by Oeneral Motors in Alexandria. The value of this is likewise reduced. Whenaiiow the s&amp;ir to-retum to MeQoa «..^ + « . x . ^ '' er ^ ain su ^6 of money which he promised should be £gOC) gold a year. If « received «hi, the Prince, ttougl, reeponein. ror . l.r g . fi^, . oal4 . M . t0 „ Mg , tut UM &gt;m again this, the King has sent nothing. The Prlnoe gentle and 111 worries greatly. He •anted so much to call his sister here from Mecca last year for medical care, but she died in Mecca last August of cancer - unable to have an operation. '■iouid you help His Highness, through some Mussulman perhaps, who would be willing to give for his religion's sake to a descendant of his Prophet. We should need no help if King ibn Saoud kept his written promise. 2 have taken the great liberty of asking your help as I cannot bear to see my husband so worried now his health is so delicate. Respectfully yours, (Signed) Fatma Haider.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000193_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/128</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000193</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/128</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 704/1935 Arabia: Request for Financial Assistance for the ex-Amir of Mecca</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-11-09T09:17:21</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (14 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate reverse chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 14; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file mainly consists of correspondence between the India Office and the Foreign Office, and enclosed copies of Foreign Office correspondence, relating to the former Amir [Emir] of Mecca, Sherif Ali Haider.It includes a letter from Kenneth Johnstone, Foreign Office, to John Gilbert Laithwaite, India Office, 31 January 1935 (folios 10-11), enclosing a copy of a letter from Princess Fatma Haider (née Miss Dunn), the wife of Sherif Ali Haider, which she sent to the Prince of Wales, and which was passed on to the Foreign Office by the Prince’s Private Secretary. In her letter, dated 10 January 1935 (folios 13-14), Fatma Haider states that her husband is ‘old and delicate’ and describes his difficult financial situation, stating that he was promised £200 of gold a year by the King of Saoud [Saud] when the latter refused to allow her husband to return to Mecca, but that in the present and previous year the King had sent nothing. Fatma Haider’s letter appeals for help from the Prince of Wales ‘through some Mussulman perhaps’. In the letter from Johnstone to Laithwaite of 31 January 1935, Johnstone asks whether the India Office has any observations to make on the matter, and states how the Foreign Office intends to reply to the Prince’s Private Secretary. A reply from Laithwaite to Johnstone of 5 February 1935 (folio 8) states that the India Office has ‘no comments to offer, but note the course of action which the Foreign Office propose to adopt’.A copy of a letter from the Foreign Office to Sir Godfrey Thomas, the Prince of Wales’s Private Secretary, 12 February 1935 (folios 5-7), gives a brief account of the Sherif, and concludes that ‘we have no political reason for wishing to assist him’, and that ‘unless, therefore, His Royal Highness is personally disposed to assist the Sherif indirectly, we can only suggest that a regretful reply in the negative should be returned to Princess Fatma’s request’.The file also includes a copy of letter sent to the Foreign Office from Godfrey Thomas Havard, Consul General, Beirut, 27 March 1935 (folio 3), informing the Foreign Office of the death of Sherif Ali Haider on 24 March 1935.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Fatma Haider</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Ali Haider</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Edward VIII</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Personal finance</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul-General, Beirut</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Mecca</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000193#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
