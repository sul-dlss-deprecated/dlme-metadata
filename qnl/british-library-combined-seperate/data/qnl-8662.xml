Each report is organised under subheadings which vary from report to report but broadly cover: local administration; trade; smuggling; political affairs; security; communications; British interests; Russian (or Soviet) activities; army; and western reforms. The file also contains an appreciation on the political situation at Seistan [Sīstān] for the period July to December 1946, submitted by HM Vice-Consul at Zabul, which was presumably added to the file in error (ff 24-25).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the front of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Seistan and Kain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mekran</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Political intelligence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00006d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
