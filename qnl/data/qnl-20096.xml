                           Tigris, to Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Indian Naval Squadron, Persian Gulf, dated 6 September 1852. Tronson reports on his visit to the Arab coast under Kemball's orders (ff 117-120) to investigate the abduction and wounding of a Sharjah vessel's crew members by the crew of a vessel from Dubai. Tronson describes his conversation with the ruler of Dubai, telling the Sheikh that the captain of the boat responsible for the kidnap will be fined, and his crew given 'four dozen lashes' and 'put in irons' for a week. Kemball comments on Tronson's communications with the sheikhs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, in relation to reparations for violations of the Maritime Truce on the pearling banks, stating that Tronson made an error in mentioning 'corporal chastisement' as possible punishment.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x000046#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
