I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, No, 45., dated 2 oth A^t.907. a of the ,ette F noted in the margin, with enclosure on the subject of Sheikh Mubarak's latest grievance against the Turks, in connection with his recent purchase of a date garden. Ug^efetence to this purchase contained in Political Agent, Koweit's No. S7^datmi4fh July 1907, a paraphrase of which was com municated to Government by the Political Resident in his telegram No. 6, Shiraz, dated 29th July 1907, was purely incidental and identical with the entry in the Koweit Diary quoted by Major Knox, which in turn will be found as paragraph 1489 of the Political Diary of this Residency. 2. There can be little doubt, I imagine, that this incident has weighed with the Sheikh in the negociations at present pending on the subject of Bunder Shweikh to a degree scarcely justified by its intrinsic importance ; and I would venture, with great respect, to suggest that its effect may be expected to be, in some degree at least, transient, and that the present moment is therefore pecu liarly advantageous for the conclusion of the negociations in question. 3. Enquiries will be made by the earliest opportunity from His Majesty's Consul, Basrah, on the subject of the incident now reported, and the prospect of Sheikh Mubarek's obtaining redress in any form. t No. 451, dated Koweit, the 20th August 1907 (Confidential). From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward, herewith, the true copy and translation of a letter received by me from Sheikh Mubarak, in which he states that he has been prevented from purchasing the land in the Wilayat of Basrah, referred to in my Diary No. 29 for the week ending 17th July 1907, and again in paragraph 5 of my confidential letter No. 375, dated the 14th July 1907, to the First Assistant to the Resident, Bushire. 2 ' The Sheikh s letter is studiously moderate in tone, far more moderate than the terms in which he informed me of the event when he alluded to that 'deceitful rotten Turkish Government.' He said that when he asked for his money back, he was told that the earnest money had gone to Sheikh Sadun-ul- Muntafich, but that the Turkish authorities would write and ask him for it. This the Sheikh seemed to regard, as adding insult to injury. He showed me a letter from H^ExceHency that arrived with the news of the incident under report in which the Turkish authorities asked for a further payment of revenue for the Fao lands in advance. 3. However undesirable it may be for the Sheikh to give hostages to fortune by making large purchases of immoveable property in Turkish territory I believe that there is a Turkish regulation authorising the free sale and purchase of landed property subject to registration, and it is difficult to see how His Excellency the Wali of Basrah can justify his action in refusing to sanction the 4' Moreover, it would appear that the incident might be made use of as showing a tendency on the part of the local Turkish authorities to regard Sheikh Mubarak as an undesirable alien ; Sheikh Mubarak looks to us for support in this matter on which he feels very strongly, and it would seem doubtful whether the supreme authority at Constantinople would approve of the very impoliticIV further the sympathies o ^ His Excellency's action as playing into my sonally, I am inc ' I Jj i t canction the sale, ostensibly owing to hands, but, if he c ° u hut really from the Sublime Porte's desire to stand well the country.

It is as you know very difficult in these matters to, get our friends to be at all precise, but I went over the Vort ^clear ance' point again and again to make sure that I had the right details, as stated by Sheikh.

With reference to the first reason,Bheikh Lobarak claims that the liiuits of the ^'ort '^ere laid lov/n long ago in vrriting in his poa^e^ion and that he has no knov/ladge v/nj theiaa liioi'ts have been enlarged and that he has been given no optx&gt;ruun i of representing his- the Proprietor's- views and00072 has received no ooriipensation for 'this clearance which would render desolate a large portion of his land. 4. As regards 'the second reason 'there appears to Lie to be no comparison between the so called highhandedness of Sheikh Hobarak in erecting a small embankment that cannot possibly in peace time he a serious menace to the safety of the ^ort and that could easily be removed if real encroachmenL is proved and adjudicated on and itathe wanton da mage done to valuable property by the Fort soldiers in letting flood water on to the gardens.Such damage is irreparable for the chance of Sheikh Hobarak obtaining compensation from the Turks is small in deed. Sheikh Hobarak declares that the bunds are eleven years old and that they have merely been repaired.He also informs me that he and the n'ort military authorities bult them together eleven 3 ears ago. 5. A3 regards the third reason, it would be in teresting to learn, when Sheikh Hobarak received clear official instructions that he was not to build the embankments and even if he did do so contrary to orders,he may rdead that it is impossible to obey such orders, as he cannot stand by and see his property go to ruin for want of vrover reuair.H/is constant complaint to me is that the Turks will not allow him to exercise the right that each and every one /- the meanest proprietor on the river- has viz: to protect his property against the devastation not only of the river as in the case of more fort/anate proprietors higher up river but also of tne sea. o. It is perhaps worth noticing that 'one Kaim Mokam of ^ao,the highest local civil authority, is apparently on Sheikh Hobarak 1 s side in this affair.00073 7 The laivter of which a 'translation is for- warded may read strangely and appear peremptory in tone but too great importance should not be attach ed to that, as Sheikh MobaraK was perfectly friendly in discussing the matter and 'one atubiguous phrase about searching for a way to preserve his honour is simply a vague threat intended to produce an iiu- pression and there is not the slightest doubt that Sheikh Mobarak thoroughly appreciates the advantages that accrue to him from our protection of Kovmit.

He suggests that Knox or Crow should represent us and that he and•a representative of himself and of the Wali should meet at Fao. They could examine the position on the spot by the light of Sheikh MubarekVs documents. If he \ is found to have encroached or exceeded the rights, he will have no further grievance. But if the Turks have without justification destroy ed his dykes, as he contends, he urges us to insist on their giving him compensation and a guarantee of immunity in the future from arbit rary oppression.

Date 23JDH.1908 ^ j Bushire. sir ' I have the honour to inform i~ou. that Bheikh llobarak has, at two interviews lately, laid great stress on the question of his Fao es tates and I believe contemplates a strong reference on the subject in reply to your letter re quarantine forwarded under cover of your letter No. 1802,dated the 7th June 1908. 2. The Sheikh asstires me,but I find it difficult to credit his assurance#, that he has been promised,before my time,protection with regard to these'estates,I had told him carefully explaining \ at the same time that it was a casual reference in a private letter from Mr Crow, that the Consul at Basra believed that the real obstacle to a settle ment in accordance with Sheikh Mobarak's wishes is the opposition of the Military officers of the Turkish administration. 3. To combat this view, the Bheikh the other da^ r directed his secretary Abdul Aisis to read to me a report emanating from Basra which said that His Excellency the Wali had been unable to obtain any reply, from the Fariq either at Basra or Bagdad, supporting his allegations with reference to the00125 Sheikh 's alleged encroachment on the river. The Sheikh maintains that he has? all the subordinate officials on his side and that his only obstacle is His Excellency who wishes to extort money from him. 4. The Sheikh* s proposals appear, on the surf ace, eminently reasonable •He states that all he requires is an enquiry by a representative com mission of Basra notables at which be suggests that His Excellency, himself and the Basra Consul should be present, either in person or by deputy # He states that he is quite ready to abide by the finding of that commission but that even if it decrees that the land is,as it is called,Tash, i.e.reclaimed land, he claims the right enjoyed by all riparian owners to pay a fixed sum for the privilege of re clamation and to be permitted thereafter to enjoy it in peace,Sheikh Ilobarak, even goes further and says that, while utterly denying the reclamation, at least within the past 14 years, he will, for the sa^e of peace and quietness admit,without enquiry that the land is Tash and pay the fees claimed .But he asks that this should be lone speedily to avoid further injury to the land.This last was in answer to my suggestion that it would be as well to await the reply of the British Government to the repre sentations already made by him and fowarded by yourself. 5. Considering the grave importance that the Sheikh attaches to this question, and his evi dent determination to put this difficutlty forward as a stop to all our negotiations with him, I have the honour to propose a visit b3 myself accompanied by some representative of t/ne Bheikh to Fa.o to ex amine the condition of the broken embankments com plained of an the amount of injury likely to be caused thereby .This would, in the natural course, be00124 followed by a visit to Basra,where I could,through Oonsul at Basra,place the matter before His Excellency and endeavour to effect some BOi r t of settlement, even if only a temporary one,pending the reconsideration of the question or, at least, obtain from His Excellency some definite statement of the reasons or regulations,owing x.o which H.E.has for bidden the repair of these embankments. 6. I understand that the 'Lawrence /# is at present at Basra and would suggest that she might be employed for the purpose of the up river trip which should not take more than a week at the outside.lt is difficult to imagine that the Turkish authorities could offer any valid objection to my walking round Sheikh Mobarak*s Fao properties.lt would be necessary to respect the quarantine regu lations at Pao which might cause a slight delay. Should His Excellency refuse to receive me in the company of His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basra, there would be no necessity for me to appear at all and in any case I should, of course, be guided en tirely by His Britannic Majesty's Consul in all communications made and the manner of making them to His Excellency.

Various reasons have been aliened for x^iis action but tvfo contradictor.^ ones now stand out s (1) that the land was ntv/lj reclaitied I'^iid • l?&amp;is contention is evidently implied in His Kxosix- enoy the Wall of Basra's aiabiguous letter , of which a conj' and translation was forwarded with 12c letter no: 181 iated 15/4/08 to the Political resident in the Persian f 'hilf . {■J)that the onltivation or th l^nd of which the embankment was broken was obstructing the view froia the fort and that a clear srmce of 600 aetees was quired all round the fort for defensive purposes . Mr Consul Grow makes a casual reference in a pri vate letter to ae » which I quote ' S oj * I 00 ild do uore for ilobarak &gt; but the uilitai^, people au Constantinople are absolutely opposed to any enoroaoh- aent on the perimeter of the Pao fort . -he ioc .1 authorities seem well-disposed to the Sheikh , though the arms tr ,ffio is a sore point and they think he encourages it . ' Sheikh Hobarak declares that the embankment in ques tion 1b certainly very old and that from the land which 1' protects , the mud was taken to build tr.e fort . He say ; that it nrns in a continuation — in- terrupted however by a oree; — and to the north 0 .00135 the fort embankment ; an 1 that , v/hen the fort was built , he and the fort authorities combined amicably to embank or repair embankiaents together . He says that » since that date , 35 years ago he has carried out yearly and even more frequent repairs , as occ asion denanded , to the embankment and his men 'have never been interfered with tmtil now . In aixvpart of this contention , he has produced copies of certain correspondane^which took place in the early part of the year be u we en His j^ccellency th- Wali of Basra and the Kaiia—mokaai of Fao • It must be said that these do nov appear to be official copies , but they were probably furnished by 'oha Kaim-mokam of Fao to the Sheikh . Bheikh Ilobarak explains that certificated copies of Turkish records are not pro curable • In that correspondence , he Kaim-mokam corroborates the destructior^y night of the embank- ment b3 r Turkish soldiers - in itself a suiiicientl^ lawless and high-handed proceeding , for which it would not^e too much to demand the punishment ol ua officer oorimanding the fort -and the Sheikhas atata- ment that the embankment is an old one . The letoera of x-he Kaim-mokm also indicate thvt the nearness of the cultivation to the fort is the reason whs tne embankment was destroyed • A Turkish CoMaision , composed of the following members , The commander of the Turkish corvette The Kaim-mokam of ffao A Yus-bashi from Basra sat on the question . No Kowait representative was present , according toSheikh Mobarak . The embankment had not been repaired after tjTe damage done to then by the Turkish soldiers an t have noi been rep .ired ye^' The Conation expressed the opinion that there wao no necessity to interfere with the embankments , but that they obstructed the view from the fort and that0 10136 ZZZP ****** repairs should not, be executed ( vide^Political Agent's letter no:&lt;55 dated 2/3/08 to '• b.© Political He si dent in. 1 Jib Pspsisn (riilf ) I was surprised at the time Sheikh Mobarak inforaed me of the decision that he made no attempt to have ihis order questioned , but, it would seem that the Coioiii ^ion were not unanimous and \ hat i.ha views of the military member on taw purely military question carried the day against his two colleagues who wer« not disposed to agree */ith him . The Sheikh ras apparently awaiting th end of his correspondence with His Exoellenoy the Wali o f Basra • The ambiguous letter from His Excellency already referred to above dated 51st March (copy and transla tion forwarded vith isc letter no: 181 dated 16th April seems to have roused Sheikh Mobarak t o further exertions and he wrote asking the Political Resident to protect him in the enjoyment of his rights un^er date 8th April 1908 , forwarded with my no: 181 dated 15th April 190B . The Bheikh now seeks to upset the finding of that Com- -Mission and to that end requires th*-. appointment of a fresh Commission o Basra notables • He suggests the following names . The NakTb of Basra ♦ Haji llahmud Pasha , w ^cTl -i-imlak as BanT 1 a • 'Abd ur RaszaSc Ghalabi , liaTs al BaladTj a- , and otli^ er men ff of their standing . He asks that ? at the sitting of the new Commission , His Excellency the Wali of Basra and himself should either be present or represented by deputy and he attaches great importance to the presence of a British official , preferably » the resident in the Persian Oulf or his deputy or H.BJiis Consul at Basra • He asks that the new Goasu^sion may definitely decide whether i he Icands , of which the embankment was broken , is newly reclaimed or not ? ■ -00137 And that a definite queBtion may be put to the Turk- isli authorities H Why he should not be allowed , even if the land 1 b newly reclaimed , to pay the usual fees , iike any other riparian proprietor and enjoy the land in peace vis: b5 repairing his eiabankment ?' If the question of the military aafety of 'ohe fon. ia raised ? he wishes to argue 'bhe qixeration , *uo contend th.t the fort is safe and to ask why the perimeter X laid down in the correspondemoe of which copies , again apparently unofficial , with translations are attached to this report as Appendix A , should be extended to 600 metres , depriving him of his propel- without his consent and without compensation . wqt this reason , it would seeki advisable t.o have a representative of the Turkish army also present at the meeting of the Comxriibsion • In Appendix A , the head of the military CoBmission , who built the fort in 1885 » appears 1.0 have stated that a plot of round , 350 metres square , v/as all that would be required .

H. and what sou ordered was made laiown - the expression of your sorrow at your not being able to be present at the assembly of the marriage night of our son Hamad because of your absence in the month of May and we were still more sorry at wanting your presence,which would have been a reason for increase in our rejoicings and perfecting our joy and and we were proud and honoured in the presence of H.B.the Naval Commander-in-Chief and we ob ained perfect joy from his visit to our torn,which is to be considered the town of (iovemment and from the friend .hip of Major Knox etc etc. and likewise his friendship with my brother Mo'iz as Sultana,Sardar ArfaStne Sheikh Khazal Khan when he honoured our town and altogether we were grateful to the presence of Major Knox etc for his friendship and his reckoning our house to be the house of the Government and I am proud in this reckoning and certainly your Honour^ believes in my friendship and love towards the pre cious Imperial^JSvernment and obedience to its loft; commands and the facilities which I procure for the Consul who is with us in everything that he demands from me according to the order of Government in Ms journeys in the Arabian peninsula, whether it ma^ oe to Ant a'a which is near Al Ahsa and The place of settling of the tribes of Al Ahsa and I cau^e^148 vdtii him t3ie chiefs of the tribes aforesaid in his service,or it may be to A1 A&amp; sh Hafar,which is the boundai^T between us and Nejd and I cause to go with the Consul the .Amirs of the Arabs in his service and it may be xo Basra on the desert road servants are in his service and from these facilities which I grant, I have seen opposition from the Turks and universal injury to m5 r property in l^ao which is the livelihood of the family of Subah, all of 'bhem. The Turks have destroyed it,.And if raat'oers remain in this opposition,we shall abandon it (viz: the land) and also,before this,two zea.rs ago,my clerks, were driven out from my house and my property at ?ao and (3,000 maunds of my dates were destroyed and worse than the destruction was the driving out of ay clerks before all people and 'bhe injury to my honour and all that which happened to my property before I have placed it and what has fiappened now, I have also plnced it before your exalted Honour and before the Consul who is with us, Ahd besides what they are doing to 1115 property of injury, they have also stirred up the most corrupt of mankind,who is estimated by yourself and others than yourself as a noted pirate, Nagaimish, upon the boundaljies between ? ao and Ua'aamir and they send their servants,the regimental officer and the regi mental clerk and the accountant of A1 Ahsa and the Kaim Mokam and they are present at the bo\mdaries and they demand three men from Fao and three men irom Ma'aamir and three men from Fao come present, three good old men bom in Fax) and they ask them to swear / ' about the Fao boundaries •And thoy stood on the creeii and swore honestly that this is the boundary of Fao and Ha'aakir and those whom Nagaimish presented force v /hen they ask them for their oath, they hesi tate, because they are liars and not from the peopleof Ma*aiiair and they see the appearance of opposi tion of Those who come from Ma'aakir and the^ Imow that the truth is v /ith the persons who come from the people of B 1 ao. Then when they come back to Basra and their friends ask them^what do you write?* 1 . TW answer 'The right is with Mobarak but we see tne intention of the Wali said we write'-^nd^ apart from that, when e ® servants are pre sent, my af?i;ents in Fao#only two men and their rosaries in their hands and when Nagaimish is present he brings with him 200 men# armed with fi reams .Now that is the limit of his power but I have thousands and am submissive and try conciliatory proceedings but those who are determined to do me injury - and the causes are evi dent - from the direction of the north are exciting Nagaimish and from the south their soldiers and officials and the Wali writes to the Kaim Hokam v/ho is honoured among them and under ^heir influence and threatens him with responsibility and he writes to them the actual state of affairs and mentions to them 'Mobarak has not embanked in gay days and he has no unreclaimed lands to embank •This is in 1115 days and the questioning is from the people who have information that these embankments are ox old time tod they are always repairing from it'C^id the Wali is bent on an injury and does not accept the report of the Kaim Mokak and has destroyed my property and I ask for pitj from your high position that thej should treat me '/ith Justice and that they should send from the people of Basra persons who are under their influence like the Hakib of the Sharifs of Basra and Mahmud Pasha, the v/akil i Sannia^and people like them that they may see and I will accept. And I,my first treaty with the Government 11&amp; first conditions were the preservation of my property and they gave me an order for that from your predecessoririso present with me and its copy with you.That is not for the protection of Koweit. The matter of Koweit is to me a small affair.Its people will defend it some how or/otrier. Ivly only object is the protection of my property and iiiy honour,It is not a question of covetousness.I have plenty of w^ealth and sitting down I see neglect on your part. And I and ray property and my good naoie and my honour are entering into the protection of the precious Imperial English (rovemment and in spite of all these troubles which I see from the Turks, I am still patient and your orders wMoh I shall perforrn whether in quarantine or other waysy^nd your lofty Presence ordered that the quarantine has been arranged in Masicat and Bahrein.I would present to your Highness, although that is an. evident matter^ which you know^but for the manifestation of the position I do not resemble my brothers,the Amir of Maskat 8^4 the .toir of Bahrein,'^or the aforesaid y passengers do not go to them in the mails except by chance from among the 'Deople of their towns.I am the ruler of Koweit and the whole of the Arabian peninsula and in it ma$y great princes under my orders and entrusting their heads to m© and those who come from India and other places are not the people of Koweit but of all the tribes and 01 all the people of Hejd and, as soon as there was the name of the quarantine,! began to content them, and the princes addressed Bie aoout their families and their dependants and followers who come in the mail steamers why I was stopping them in ihe harbour when they were coming from a long Journey and uno.oe awaiting from a distant road and stopping them that they should not see them nor greet them, Tnen I content them and answer them that this is the orier of the ci-oveirmient.They aaiswer^No matter.that is^let tefc the order of the i Government proceed for00151 separating us and we are Islam .We say vrtiat Grod wills, will be and what he does not wish*will not be.And W 9 were vexed by the Quarantine and it does not reDeltGod is the repeller^And we see your servants who are in your possessions at Fao flying away from Turkish oppression and they in jour assembly inform us of all that is going on against (your)property» Also# in our places# reaches us news of all that goes on against 50U from the injxiries inflicted by the Turks, especially against your Fao property .Now we vd.ll not G0n3on'L 'to these troubles which are against Shara* and we will not agree about you that fyou should be patient under these troubles which are happening against your property.Then if this Govem- ment whom you and we are following — at your desire i expressed to us - will repel from your property then it is due from you that you conciliate them in such a wayas may not injure.Then if we see that,then we shall know that your opinion has hit the marh.But if the Turks go on in this way in the injuiy of your property without right and there is no stopping that,enough,we have not seen a place for protection . We do not want protection. Now the intencion is that I should make pi iin the circumstances and in spite of all this, I am under your orders,And the passengers who come in the mail boats,there will be from the people of Koweit one in ten and nine from the families of the tribes and people of Nejd -and the Princes whoso followers will come in the mail steamers in their address to me they have the right on their side against me because I also have seen ^our caiele-c-ness about the protection of Jay property for the re pelling from it in the path of right and the present customs in Basra (apparently Turkish vexations misrule).And in spite of all this,! am at ^our00152 orders# if 3'0U order rae to be patient under the injury to no' property and the objections urged by the Arab princes against me, then I, according to my custom, vail rest patient under orders but I say 'This is against your well known and proved pity and your protection to every one who flees for shel~ ~ter to your shadow,Now I and my name and my property are under your protection and under your orders♦ Then it was incumbent on me to present the cir- cimstuices.Your Consul who is in Ba-ra heard from the Wall that this I md which Mobarak has enclosed came out of the river,Then what comes out of the river there is in it to the Oovernment a right,How their fort has been built 22 years from its com mencement and the mud which they have used to eia- bank is from this place and also this embankment which I enclosed for the protection of my property is fourteen years old and yearly I repair it and others not less than three or four times.And xtem their officials were looking on at it and did not moleBt me,Then^ if it is a fact / that there is in my possession land coming out from the river it is necessary that they should deal with me according to the rules and precedents, as they do witn oiners^ according to the agreements of the assembly of the Idara who will make me owner of the land in the change of re cords. The ownership in the change oi records is to the owner of the lands whether myself or another. Then I demand right like all the Basra propria— tors, that they should deal with mespsMis bj sending persons of Basra, as I have mentioned in my petition above,who know aboixt properties and their present day rules and that they should see this land which they are quarrelling with me about and 1 will abide by whatever the$e people may say, after thai see it. And I also will make present with them whomsoever0015-3 jou Eiaj appoint, the Consul at Basra or another that lie may te present.Then that is what is incumbent u^on j-ou that you should watch over no rights. Otherwise^, if I have no right, at that time, I will be content.Also the princes who are now objecting against me,when they have seen assistance from j ou, in the protection of my rights they also will be content and will not object against me.And this contradiction is only from the Wali of Basra and your Sovernment has ordered that they sent the doctor especially on account of qftarantine and what we know is that the doctor was sent by the Government out of pity for the comfort of the sick of the people.This is according to our request when we asked for xhe doctor.The7,when it is incumbent on us to establish an officer of quarantine,we will appoint him from one of our followers he will refer to the doctor.This ma what was necessaiy .We hope for your assistance and may you remain etc etc. 14th Jaaadi al Awwal 1338.H.= 14th June 1908.

Sir, In con'tinua'tion of oorreBpondence ending with your office telegram dated the 9th instant on the subject of Sheikh Mobara&amp;'s Fao properties, I have the honour to report that I arrived in B^IAS^Law- -rence' at Basra on the morning of the 16th instant* On the following day through the courtesy of Consul, Basra,a visit from His Kxcellency the Wali,at which I had the advantage of being present, was arranged at t,he Consulate. 3. H.B.M's Consul asked H.H. if he would be so kind as to favour us with the views of the local Ottoman authorities on the following question as Sheikh Mobarak's complaints were continual and the Government of India was anxious for me to report as fully as possible on the facts of the case. The question was posed in the following ways- 'Why did the Turkish soldiers break down the embank- ment erected by Sheikh Mobarak and recently repaired by him?' Was it on account of the land being newly reclaimed? Was it on account of the embankment proving preju- -dicial to the safety of the Fort? 4. His Excellency replied that the embankmentv , 00163 ms broken dowi by the soldiers under the immediate orders of the Goriimandant of the Fao fort and in consequence of some rather ambiguous orders issued by the Goxamandant at Ba^ra and that the question was a militazy one^The claim of the military authorities which was, so said, supported by the finding of the cirbt commission of ©inquiry consisting of the Fort Oommandant, the Commander of the 'Turkish cornette,and the Kaim Mokam of Fao, was to the effect that Sheikh Mobarak had by advancing his embankment 4. enclosed some 39,000 square metres of newly reclaimed Tash land,which was Government property and was re quired for military purposes vis: the safety ^/aone of the fort^This safety zone, so H»E«assured us,he had ascertained from the local Commandant haxi been recently laid down by regulation to be a distance of 330 metres radiating from the Fort in all directions for a fiVe sone and for a second 'view' aone as one might call it a similar distance of 600 metres also radiat ing from the Fort in all directionssaid that he had been assured by the military surveyors that the land that Sheikh J/Iobarak had attempted to reclaim lay within the safety sones, 5, I asked my colleague to inform H f B t that Shei&amp;h Mobarak was under the impression that this committee Had come to a different conclusion via: that the disputed ground foimed part of the Fao properties but that the eabanlnaent was prejudicial to the safety of the '•'orb.To this H«E.made no definite replj. 6, i said to my colleague that possibly H.w, might like to hear from me what were Sheikh Ilobarak's pretentions with regard to the land in question and H .B.courteously expressed his willingness to hear anything I might have to say on the subject.On this 1 said that Sheikh Hobarak claimed that the piece of land in question was of long standing and at any rate00164 within recent times had not been reclaimed from the river, as the mud which had gone to build the Fort walls had been taken from it twenty years ago. That Sheikb Kobarak claimed that the embankment, recently dSDiolished b^ tho lurkish soldiers had been erected fourteen 6^£*3 ^&lt;BO surd lictd. b©6n r'spo.iPQd. 'biir©© Bind four 'timos aiinuall^ iii't»oi*fGr©iioe or GxpostiU** lation from ^he Ottoiaan local authorities,I added that Sheikh Mobarak requested the appointaient of a oomission of Basra landed proprietors to adjudicate on the question of whether the land in dispute was newly reclaimed land or not and I gave H^E.the names of the notables suggested by the Sheikh and detailed in the report that accompanied my letter No.330, dated tiie 35rd June 1908 to your address.I did not consider it advisable at this juncture to mention the Sheikh's toiaBds as to the presence of a British representative while the cojmaission was sitting. I st vted that the Sheikh was even ready for the sake of peace and quietness to admit that the land was newljr reclaimed land, provided that he received penaission after payment of the usual taxes to re claim, enclose and cultivate the property in question. H t S*3eeraed to offer no objection to the appointment of the Commission and express^/lly said that* if the Military authorities abandoned their claim,there would be no difficulty raised by the Goveimient to selling, as he put it, the new land to Sheikh Mobarak. 7. As regards the military claim, I infoimed H.S.that Sheikh Hobarak had also a reply to make to their claims viz! that 30 years ago when the Goimiss- -ion otoe to construct the 'ort. Sheikh Mobarak and his brother had petitioned to H,E«asking for a definite statement of the suaount of land that was required for 'the building of the Fort .The petition had been re ferred to the Majliss who had, in their turn, sent it90165 •bo the head of the Port conmission.Thati official bad replied in writing and Sheikh Mobarafc held a copy of hia letter that the land required for the port was a square piece of ground of which the length V was to be 330 metres and the breadth likewise arid no more# 8 # had already in the course of conver sation alluded to the despatch of 'the last military mission that discussed the matter of the land with Sheikh Mobarak at Fao on the 4th July but professed to be ignorant of the finding of that Ooimission.I informed H.S # that Sheikh Mobarak had told me that he had discussed the matter with the Commission and that, while he was of course unaxmre of the actual finding of that Commission, he had understood from them that they if ere on the whole favourable to his views and would report in that sense to their superiors, that they admitted the land in dispute to be the Sheikh's property enjoyed for many years and that with regard to the safety of ^he ^ort f it was true that a aone of 600 metres said even more was required by the regu- Fao lations but that theZB'ort did not, in any sense comply with the requiremjaata» as on the west flank of the ffort, there was no^lone whatever as the date garden? oome right up to the west wall of the fort. 9. B,H.replied that, if the military authorities proved to be of that opinion, there would be no diffi culty whatever in meeting Sheikh Hobarak's wishes if they were put forward clearly and concisely in the manner that he had heard them formulated by me.H.A. said that Sheikh Moharak had inundated him with a mass of vague correspondence,now threatening, now complaining,from which it was difficult to ascertain hia actual wishes.I assured H.B.that,if he so aesired, I should be glad to use suoh influence as I possessed with Sheikh Mobarak to induce him to put his requests| 0C16&amp; ^ (jxear and oomprehenaive language which TOuld be jubaitted to H.K.through my oolleague.H.E.was good enough to express the pleasure with which he would receive Sheikh Mobarak* s representations through this ohannel. winding H.B.so well disposed to listen to lv# our aide of the story my colleague, at my suggestion, assed H.E.if there would be any objection to my visit ing Sheikh Mobarak's Fao estates unofficially and especially the disputed ground, as a visit to the spot would enable me, in my report to superior authority, to elucidate the position far better than any mumber of complaining letters or evan conversations.H.E. re plied that there would be no objection whatever to my visit. 11. H.E.asked if I could inform him why Sheikh Mobarak,who already enjoyed such large estates, attach ed such great importance to this tiny little strip of waste land.To this I said that I could only reply that Sheikh Hobarak was at heart a peasant and held tenaciously to every foot of his Fao lands.I instanced to H.l.the absolute refusal of Sheikh Ilobarafe to sell, lease or even for pecuniary compensation limit his right to plant date trees in such a way as would completely destroy the amenities of the cool N.W .wind for our unfortunate telegraph of ficials -.t ..ao. 13. It only remained for me to thank H.&amp;.fo^- the courteous patience with which he had been good enough to listen to my representations.A visit was arranged for me the following day at which no matters of importance were even touched on.M; colle igae pro i poses to visit the Turkish Commandant alone and try | and ascertain from 'him what is the military point of view and what finding the latest commission anived at atid I shall have 'uhe honour to submit a report in continuation of t-he present one after I have receiveda 00167 this informal on after hqt visit to ^ao in the company of either Sheil^h Mobarafe or his representative. My Basra oolleagiie concurs with me in thinking that, after the clear statement made by H*i3»with regard to jay visit at .?ao,no possible objection can be raised to it hereafter. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Major, Political Agent,Koweit. L^0 Confi^ 0n ^ a ^ 00168 No.399 of 1908.

Indeed it appeared from the interview that, as Mr Consul Grow had already intiiaated, the opposition Sheikh Mobarah's views was mainlj from tary authorities aad that the civil authorities were disposed to be complacent, if xhey could only discover a way to be so. Consul was good enough to promise me a letter giving the results of his conversation with t*a Hilita^ Gommandant and a copy of that letter will be forwarded immediately on receipt. • rv the 19th JuX^,! 2.

Moolla Abdtilla failed to see the Sheikh who was on shore but from the steamer's ladder,infomed the Sheikh's aecretai^ of all that^necessary and returned on board the 'Lawrence ,, liimiediately.He had been oarefully ins^in.icted not to go on shore nor even on board the Sheikh 1 s Bteamer so as to avoid all possible quarantine difficulties with the Turkish quarantine officer at Fao # 3. We proceeded down river to a spot^ pointed as the bounriar^- between the l^'ao and Ha 1 amir proneI'tiea^ whence I proceeded to the shore in the stesuii cutter^ while the 'Lawrence' resuiaed her course to ^ao village and finally anchored opposite the Telegraph buildings, 4 # I Icmded at the sDot^ indicated to by m5 r chuprasBi^ Haniad f who is an inhabitant of this part of the country / and was met inMediataly by one of Bheildi Mobarak* a cultivators, one Inwaihi Dish- -man # I was acconix^ajaied by Sub 1 ieutenant Gorser from H.l.M.S,'Lawrence',Hoolla Abdulla and one chuprassi,the aforeass&amp;tnaiaed Hamad.Inwaihi liish- -man led us a little wajf inland and we made our way over three or four se* arate blocks of date gardens^ each divided from the other by a creek* We worked down the last creek to the river again and at the point where creek and river met found ourselves in a rough open enclostire, *\rhere there were perhaps a dosen retainers of Sheikh Mo/barak all fully armed*! asked for the headman and two men presented themselves.One was Badar bin Muhammad ash Shathi who had just been relieved A of his charge and the relief was Brahim bin Abdul Jabbaijit who said that he was at x/ne head of 30 men. 5. I was info mad that the quarrel arose over a small piece of land at the outlet of tue-enad out arid had originally curled southwards but such land as had been enclosed by this pro cess was of vers- small extent and was unoulti^ vated.Even if properly reclaimed and fenced in, it could not have contained a doaen date trees. From thence,! crossed the creak into the Ha 4 amir property to see if we could find any of the Ma 1 - ~amir cultivators to see what they would say on the subject. The re were no indications on their side of an amed detachment and we only saw three unarmed men, two of whom were on the oppo site side of the next creek and positively dis claimed all knowledge of the dispute.The third man who came up at the moment we persuaded to accompany us to the spot previously indicated but he also absolutely refused to commit himself to any statement of i/he causes of quarrel, much less to his view of 'Uie Fao Ma*amir bound- ~ary»Our stay at this spot could not have ex ceeded ten mimrtes and I embarked again wonder ing why so very small and worthless a piece of ground should have occasioned ouch bitter quarell- -ing.I was informed that the creek on which the detachment was posted was called Nahar i Moosa bin Ivlarzuk al Abbadi# 6. It was not long that I was peimitted to remain in this state of doubt.In the course of my stay at Fao, I was assured by the loca l g ossip that it was an open secret that the creek on which the detachment was posted was not tne 'Nahar i Moosa 1 * but the 'Nahar i Ghath -ban 11 and that Sheikh Mobarak has taken from the Ma* amir date garden probably 100 yards wide and stresil ing from the river on the east side to the mar shes on the west♦Which version is the true oneit&gt; is clitficixlt I jO buij t/lioirQ is no doubij that a large tract of extremely valuable and v^ell cultivated land is in dispute and it will be necessary to move ¥dxh extreme caution before we lend our support to what may quite likely be a piece of serious lawless aggression# 7. I next proceeded down river and landed at the Telegraph buildings and delivered a letter from the Quarantine officer at Basra to the Quarantine officer at Fao.As I had no motive for concealment, I expressed a wish to see the Kaim Mokak but it was midday and he was taking his siesta, 8. I again embarked and we went down stream to the house of Abdur Bahlm bin Haji Rashid who ia Sheikh Mobarak's principal Fao agent and an inhabitant of this part of the country.Here we were met by the news that Abdur Eahim was out and would not be back till sunset, so I despatched my chuprassi Hamad with a local man to go by land to the Has an Nabt,the extreme southern end of 'ohe Fao properties,where Abdur Rahim was stated to be,while we proceeded thither by sea, so that we could catch him on his return Journey whether by see or land* 9. I was now accompanied by the Telegraph nakhoda one 'STasin but we failed to find Abdur Hahiia who had left a little before Yasin in the dinghy reached his objective, 10. We then returned a short way up river and proceeded to a house N,of the Turkish fort which v. was said ' lo overlook the land in dispute betxreen Shaikh Mobarak and the military authorities of the ?ao fort,This house belonged to Ahmed bin Hizq of whom mention has already been made in the correspondence relating to Warba island / and here I waa vjlth the utmal Arab hospitali-ty prompt^,made welcome. As we proceeded westwards up t A \6 1 ^ little creeK bounded on either side toy reeds, naiitioda Yasln pointed out to BM) th® broken bund and informed me that it had been constructed in ' gj, hours by 1000 men of whom SOO mm from the Persian side of the river,while the soldiers were afraid to interfere. 11, The Arabs-and there were a matter of a dozen or so at Ahmed bin Rizq's house-informed me that, in their position, they were between the devil and the deep sea and were at their wits' ends to know what to do.If they carried out Sheilch Mobarak's orders, they incurred the hosti lity of the Fort soldiers and, if xhej' did not, tiiey had Sheikh liobarak pmishing tnem.A f?araen, overlapping Ahmed bin diaq'a date garden and house to the northerns enclosed and planted, so I ascertained / wi'bnin the last six years according to one account and within the last tnree years according w another.The significance of t,his will appear later. 12. We had been sitting in Ahmed bin date garden a matter of 30 minutes when Sheikh Nobarak's agent,Abdur Rahim, arrived, and we ins- -pected the ground enclosed the offending eiabantoaent.Abdur Aa.blm informed me that the foundations of the old embankment were laid fourteen years ago but that nothing tod been done subsequently until last autxmm when the^ whole embankment was constructed in one day.It was destroyed in the winter and had not been repaired, 13» The groimd enclosed to the eaBt of Almie bin house iiars never been oiiltdvvtel though it would no doubt be extremely Vdluaole, 3 A ^'inspection of the spot is sufficient to^173 satisfy any reasonable person that nothing of gpoB'tor value th'^^i roecls lis»:3 Toeon t3,kieii out of it up to date# I am, as a military man, entirely in sj^apatliy with the local military authorities in forbidding its cultivation.No soldier would per mit it for a moment.That, at the same time, the fort also is entirely valueless either for attack or defence is perhaps beside -ohe quest ion. It appears to me extreraely doubtful whether the enibankment was ever erected before last autumn and Abdur ii -ihln's statement is valuable as showing that Sheikh Ivlobarak has not steadily been repairing the embanfciient three or four tines per annuia for ulie last fourteen jears. The ombanlment stretching from Ahuied bin Hizq^ house to the Port creek which does protect a date garden is sound and in good repair and no one ever attempted to maintain that the Turkish soldiers touched it, 14. The inspection of the ground also dis proves another wild statement of Sheikh Hobarak 1 s viz:that if the Fort garrison fired northwards they would be firing into the Telegraph build ings and inhabited villages#The Fort fire is masked on the wast and on the west only,No rifle bullet could carry to cultivated or inhabited ground either north, east or south.Within rifle range there is nothing except ^ bk dreary swa&amp;ip land from which however the river is receding and which will be potentially valuable for date cultivation purposes after no very great lapse of time. 15. i was Just getting up to leave when the Yusbashi from the Fort came up to Ahmed bin Hlzq 1 s house and we sat and talked through an interpreter for a quarter of an hour.By theOf 174 courtesy of this gentleman, I was permitted to proceed along the bund of Ahmed bin Risq to the Fort creek though he would not give me permission to enter the Port which indeed I had not for .He explained to me what the quarrel had been about and said that while they did not ob ject to the actual enclosure if it was thought advisable to enclose this piece merely as an additional precaution against flood water,they oould not permit its cultivation in any shape or form.We returned to the ^.l.^US/'Lav/rence' that evening without mishap or difficulty of any kind. 16# 1 had heard from Mr Lobo, the clerk in charge of the Telegraph station at Fao, that the Kaim Jtokak of «Ho had been mafel&amp;g anxious enquiries about me and my Eiovei-ionts and ^nought it best to proceed at once in the morning and give a full and frank, explanation to him of my presence there- The Kaim Iloliam 1 s house is next to the Telegraph quarters and I sent Moolla Abdul la over to say that I should be ve^ glad to see him and give an explanation of m2, r presence tnere if he would receive me.A court-eous reply was sent an 1 pro ceeded attended by Hoolla Abdulla and one chup~ rassi.I^ reception was all that could oe desired and 1 explained to the Kaim Kokam that Sheikh Hobara&amp;'s comi^ints were continual and I wished to try and get at the facts as far as possible, that I had no authority of any kind and pretended to none,that His Excellency the Wall had said that he saw no objection to my visiting the spot on my return to Ko we it. The Kaim Hok^m, Sharif Bey, was so busj explaining the vl6W Of the two cases Fao - Ma*amir and rt broken embankment that I may be penaitued bo doubt whether lie paid much attention to tne planation I afforded him.He returned m^ vi^itr ci 7 h immediately at the Telegraph quarters and we parted on excellent terms, 17. sum up,the position is briefly thus. It is quite a question whether Sheikh Hobarak has or has not ooim^itted a serious aggression involving valuable property' to the north of his estates,In this matter we have no possible juris diction or pretext for interference and the matter appears one entirely for i/ne IMrkish courts to settle* 18. To the south, no real damage has been done at all.Sheikh MobaraK has erected a bund round what is at present worthless marsh land and the Turkish soldiers have destroyed it and for a very good reason too. The question of right is at best obscure and it is certainly possible to argue that by Turkish law all that land belongs to the OVLomaii (rovemuent which permits or refuses to penuit raclauaation,as it thinks fit,From the Sheikh's letters one would imagine that his estates were into gradually passing over^ddd-i the hands of the Turks,This is not so, it is a question of fresh acquisitions which the iMrks refuse to penuit him to acquire,In many directions,notably a strip of land to the north of 'the Telegraph buildings and 'fehe gardens to the north of Ahmed bin Risq's house they appear to have been ver^r generous to him and to have foregone reclauiation taxa s whi ch they mi ght, in al 1 1 -wffulne s s have claimed*Owing to the constant silting up of the river at the mouth*the i? 1 ao estates are sure to be a fruitful source of quarrels in the future and it seems hardly likely that any Government, with any pretentions to law or civilisation, will accept,without limitation.

In compliance vrtth your request,! have the honour to report that on the 17th instant,! interviewed Tahir Pasha, Coimaandant of Bar&gt;ra, on the subject of Bheikh Mobarak^s olaims at Feio. He entirely confixmed th© Vali's asserL- ion that this was purely a military question. He maintained that the uovermaent had a perfect right not only to make good their present claim but also to expi'opriate a considerably larger •Dort .ion of Mobarak^ property,of which he possessed no title deeds.The land in the proximity of the Port is said by the Turks to have been originally submerged and unfit for cultivation and when the water ret/ires all such land is claimed a?? (jovemment property. He suggested that if the Sheikh proved recal citrant in the matter the claims of the Go- vemment might be veiy r largely increased. With regard to the desxruution of the 'bund** the Commandant informed xae that only two aides had been overthrown.These had been newly erected and interfered with the efficient ~cy of the fort,being well within the circle with a radi^us of 230 metres,v/hich had been deemed necessary for the maintenance of the position.In spite of this the Militaiy Autho rities had at present no intention of assert- ing any claim to the lands behind the Fort, al- thoi^gh they lay within this zone.Tahir Pasha considers that it is quite impossible for the Government to reduce their demands which he believes are extremely moderate and reasonable.ooi8a Tie also sotfs that veiy little Injuiy has been inflicted on the Sheikh's lands,the partial destruction of the new Bund only affecting the enclosure of a barren uncultivated strip,to the ownership of which Mubarai, was never en titled.

There is less tension in the matter since the departure of Muharrem Bey, who made the difficulties, ana I think the Sheikh will find the new Vali easier to deal with in the matter.

The members of the Council did not agree to this as they said it would lead to trouble and the discussion was postponed for another occasion# It is probable that this and other pending questions will have been discussed between the Vali and the Sheikh when they met at the Naki^s house on July 30. It is rather hard to find out what passed between them for the Vali speaks Arabic and no one was present as Interpreter and the Sheikhs, Vali and Nakib discussed their business alone.

Major Knox was good enough to place his steam launch at my disposal, and Sheikh fflubarek provided me with camels for the return journey. As already reported by telegraph, my journey was in connection with the difficulties raised by the vali in regard to the transfer of the property of Fedaghia, situated in the hza of Fao, and consisting of 430 jereebs (about 415 acres) of land lately purchased oy Sheikh Mubarek of Koweit from Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir for £ T. 48,706. The vali would not allow the transfer to be made unless he, the sheikh, registered himself as an Ottoman subject. What the vali actually said when remonstrated with was that the person who wanted the transfer must produce papers of nationality, and, if an Arab, lie must produce papers of Turkish nationality. In accordance with your Excellency's instructions, I suggested to the vali that ' nationality—Koweit' on the transfer might oe accepted in place of 'Ottoman subject,' but his Excellency refused to entertain the suggestion, and insisted on the sheikh describing himself as a Turkish subject in tfie transfer papers, and on his taking out a nufuss teskereh as well. At the desire of the sheikh two preliminary agreements respecting the sale of the edaghia land were drawn up, one copy of which, signed by Abdul Wahab Kirtas, as representative of the sellers, Zoheir Pasha and his wife, was executed in my presence Jt Bussorah and witnessed by a number of the Bussorah notables ; the other copy in Wank being handed to me to deliver to Sheikh Mubarek at Koweit for his signature and legalisation by His Majesty's political agent at Koweit. These documents, duly ®ecuted, record the fact of the sale having taken place and the receipt of the money, jud are good and binding as between the parties themselves. They would form a basis for arbitration should occasion arise, but they would have no validity in the [ ourts of the Sheriat, nor would they, it appears, operate as a legal transfer of the land 01 take the place of the usual proceedings at the Tapoo Office, which are left over for c ®ipletion until the vali's opposition in the matter can be overcome. 1 took the duplicate agreement to Koweit with me for signature as described, and tailed myself of the opportunity to discuss the whole question with Major Knox and [2378 q-6] 11 li2 M 0 the sheikh himself. It would appear that the vali's opposition is premeditated, and goes to the root of the whole matter. His Excellency has, according to Sheikh Mubarek, again raised the question of Koweitis who reside and trade at Bussorah , s l# 1 taking out certificates of Turkish nationality before their claims or complaints are ^iilip r0] entertained by the vali or the courts. In July 1907 Sheikh Mubarek appears to have jisis^ reported to His Majesty's political agent that the then Vali of Bussorah, Hassan Bey, Ali- had notified certain Koweit merchants trading at Bussorah to register themselves as ijdifferei Ottoman subjects under penalty of expulsion if they refused. The merchant interested, ^ d ^ however, left Bussorah of his own accord, and the matter dropped. Sheikh Mubarek ^holdt also complained of the treatment accorded to Hammad-el-Khalid, a rich pearl merchant , t of the of Koweit, who sought to recover £T. 1,000 at Bussorah. The vali, according to the forward sheikh, insisted on the man registering himself as an Ottoman subject before enter- t()I1 tlie] taining the claim, and it seems that he acceded to this demand in order to recover his j jt0lll isleai debt. Major Knox is of opinion that Khalid was probably instructed by the sheikh to take out the nufuss teskereh with a view to bringing about our interference, and so ^ion o obtain the issue of instructions to the vali which would assist the Tapoo operations in y g0 inj connection with the transfer of the Fedaghia property, in which the sheikh himself is deeply interested. The vali also wrote to Sheikh Mubarek, so the latter informed us, inviting him to send a deputy to the Turkish Parliament, but the sheikh had not / yet answered the letter. The vali is undoubtedly doing his best to disturb the status quo previously arranged between His Majesty's Government and the Sublime Porte in regard to the | Koweit question, and it is unlikely he will be induced to modify his attitude by any arguments of mine without special instructions from Constantinople. Moreover, in view of your Excellency's telegram of the 2nd January, in which you say it would be inexpedient to raise the Koweit question at present, I hesitate^ to approach the vali directly on the subject without your Excellency's instructions, as in view of his general attitude and his recent action in regard to Tapoo proceedings it would be difficult to do so without going into the whole question. It would perhaps tide over the difficulty if the vali could be instructed to grant facilities to the sheikh for the transfer of his^ property in the present instance, failing : which it seems not improbable that the sheikh may cause the land to be registered in the names of his sons, and direct them to take out certificates of Turkish nationality for the purpose. In the course of a conversation which Major Knox and I had with the sheikh, I gathered that the latter entertained no great objection himself to such a proceeding, but I presume it would be against our interests to permit him to do so in view of the complications it might lead to after his death. It would certainly strengthen the contention of the Turks that Koweit belongs to them. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 42.) Sir, Bussorah, July 12, 1909. j IN conversation 3 T esterday with the vali I referred to the registration of the Sheikh of Koweit's land at Fedaghia purchased from Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir, to which the late vali, Moharrem Effendi, had raised objections on the ground that Sheikh Mubarek must take out an Ottoman teskereh as a Turkish subject first, and I pointed out that the sheikh was already the holder of large estates in the vilayet, which had been registered previously in his name withouf this difficulty. I said the teskereh precaution seemed to be superfluous and meaningless, as according to the convention of 1867 foreigners could acquire land in Turkey, and that the arrangement entailed their assimilation to Ottoman subjects. His Excellency agreed, and said mat Moharrem Effendi .had blundered,, but that the real difficulty arose from the matte r having been misunderstood at the Sublime Porte, which inaagined that the transfer referred to large tracts o!; Grovernment land at Ghermet Ali claimed by Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir, and regarding which litigation was proceeding between the latter and the Ottoman Govern ment. The vali said he was in communication with Constantinople on the subject, and hoped to settle the question shortly. He added, however, that Sheikh Mubarek desired the land registered in the name of one of his sons, and had offered no objection00230 3 1, his taking out an Ottoman teskereh for the purpose, though he seemed to shrink (mm letting him appear personally at Bussorah to complete the formality. I S3 'I? 1-1, 0 r E ?. cel | eil 5 y wo 1 ' ld , endeavour to smooth over the difficulty, and , et the sheikh register his land at Fedaghia in the same way as his other properties, and the vali promised me to do what he could in the matter This is the first! have heard of the Fedaghia property being mistaken for that ofGhermet Ah. They have of course nothing to do with one another, and are situated m totally different parts of the district. I am informed privately that Ahmed Pasha- es -Zoheir and his family have been m possession of property at Ghermet Ali for many years, and hold the title-deeds of the land. There is great enmity between his family and that o± the nakib, with whom the vali is at present very friendly, and the claim n ow put forward to this property by the Government seems to be the result of an intrigue on the part of Seyyid Talib, the nakib's son. It is possible the vali may have wished to mislead me, for it is quite certain that the Porte laid great stress on Mubarek- es -Sabah taking out a teskereh of Ottoman nationality, and gave orders to hold over the registration of the transfer of Fedaghia until the formality was completed. I am also informed that Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir has been endeavouring to settle the matter through the Council of State at Constantinople, and that he telegraphed recently that instructions were being sent to the vali to permit the registration of the transfer. The vali made no allusion to this in his conversation with me yesterday. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW.No. 288, dated Bushire, the 30th January (received 8th February) 1910. From— M ajor A. P.

A Government of India, a copv of the No. C .-7, dated the 18th January 1910. . x j i i - i 'i • ■ » margmally-noted letter on the subject of Sheikh Mubarak's Padhagiya property, which I have received from the Political Agent, Eoweit. No. C.-7, dated Koweit, the 18th January 1910 (Confidential). From—C aptain W. H. I. S hakespear , I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—-The I irst Assistant Resident in charge of the Residency, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your Second Assistant's endorsement No. 2667, dated the 24th October 1909, regarding the claim advanced by the Turkish authorities for the registration of Sheikh Mubarak as an Ottoman subject as a proceeding necessary to the legal transfer of landed property purchased by him. 2. In my letter No. 444, dated the 7th August 1909, I reported that the Sheikh was inclined to leave matters in status quo and that the new 'Wali, an Arab by name Sayid Arif Bey, was not hostile, whilst the question of Sheikh Mubarak's registration as a Turkish subject had not been pressed. 3. I would now cast back to the purchase in Eebruary 1909 by Sheikh Mubarak of what is known as the Padhagiya property of the az-Zuhair family, and would observe that this letter deals with the registration question arising out of tjie purchase of that property alone and not with the Sheikh's Pao estates. In recent conversations the Sheikh mentioned that the Turkish officials were not as complacent as formerly towards him and his properties and eventually he furnished me with copies (I hav e seen the originals) of the sale-deeds of the Padhagiya property, and it will suffice if the following points from them are noted:— (a) That the Padhagiya property was shared by various members of the az-Zuhair family and therefore four separate sale-deeds became necessary. {h) That the purchase by Sheikh Mubarak was completed on the 21st Mohurrum 1327(=14th Pebruary 1909), part of the price being paid on the spot in cash and part by drafts due at various dates, which the Sheikh informs me have all since been cashed. (p) That one Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas acted in all except one case as the attorney of the vendors. (d) That in each sale-deed is contained a condition that the vendor or his attorney, Abdul Wahab, shall arrange for the necessary transfers in the registers of the Land lie venue Office (the iapu Office) of the Basrah Vilayet. (e) That Sheikh Mubarak entered into possession from the date of the purchase. 4. It appears that immediately after the sale, which took place in the time of Mahrum Effendi as Wali, Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas applied for the necessary transfer in the Land Registers to be made to Sheikh Mubarak s name. The transfer was refused by the Superintendent of the Tapu Office and Abdul Wahab accordingly on the 9th Shabat 1324 (22nd Pebraary 1909) complained by letter to the Wali of his subordinate's dilatoriness. From a copy (which theSheikh has apparently succeeded in securing) of the orders and remarks passed on this petition, it appears that the Wali, Mahrum Effendi, forwarded the petition for remarks to the subordinate concerned, who replied on the same date that a telegram from the Ministry of the Interior at Constantinople prohibited the transfer pending further orders, to which the Wali appended the equivalent of our routine official remark 4 Noted Sheikh Mubarak's explanation of this telegram is that Mahrum Effendi was inimical to him and hearing of his intended purchase Of the Padhagiya property telegraphed to Constantinople that the purchase was being made by Mubarak with British gold, and it was upon this falsehood that the Ministry of the Interior telegraphed the order to delay the completion of the sale. This delay was effected at Basrah by a refusal to register the land-transfer unless Sheikh Mubarak took out a Nationality certificate labelling him as a Turkish subject. The means of salvation were communicated to Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas, but he on behalf of Sheikh Mubarak at once said that such a course was unprecedented in the case of any well-known merchant or large landowner in Basrah and much less to be contemplated in the case of an influential Sheikh of Mubarak's position who moreover held many other acres on the Shatt-el-Arab and had never hitherto been requested to conform to a regulation which was enforced but seldom and then only in the case of petty nobodies. 5. Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas continued trying at intervals to effect the transfer and Sayid Arif Bey, the Arab who succeeded Mahrum Effendi as Wali in May 1909, endeavoured to help him by getting the earlier order cancelled at Constantinople. Nothing however resulted, and Arif Bey was in turn succeeded in October 1909 by Suliman Nathif Pasha, the present 'Wali. Abdul Wahab addressed himself to the newcomer at the first opportunity and was told at once and very plainly that no transfer would be made until Mubarak had duly registered himself as an Ottoman subject. 6. Nothing further has happened and now, a year after Sheikh Mubarak took possession of the property, the price has been paid up in full, Mubarak pays the taxes, but the property still stands in the name of the az-Zuhair family and so far as the Turkish authorities and Courts are concerned is still their property. 7. Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair, who is the head of the family and represents Basrah in the new Turkish Parliament, promised his good offices in Constanti nople, but from his efforts, if indeed any were made, nothing has hitherto resulted, and as Sheikh Mubarak pointed out ' he has received his money, why should he trouble further about the purchaser and the property.' 8. Sheikh Mubarak now feels that he can do no more to settle the matter himself, that there is no hope of changing the present Wali's (Suliman Nathif Pasha's) attitude, and therefore requests that His Majesty's Ambassador in Constantinople may be urged to take up the cudgels for him to obtain either a rescission of the previous orders or a definite exemption from the necessity for registration either of his property or his person as Turkish. 9. The above gives the story of the Sheikh's difficulties from his point of view and much of the ground has already been covered in Mr. Consul Crow's two despatches to Sir Gerald Lowther, dated the 12th Eebruary and 12th July 1909, though from a different aspect. 10. Prom the previous correspondence on the subject it will be apparent that, in spite of the Sheikh's local efforts, Mr. Consul Crow's endeavours, and the late Wali Arif Bey's assistance, the demand for Turkish registration still continues. The question is a most important one as affecting the whole status of Koweit and one which would appear now to be capable of solution only in Constantinople or London. The Sheikh informed me that only one Koweiti has so far taken out a Turkish certificate of nationality, Hamid al-Khalid, whose case was reported in my predecessor's letter No. 48 of the 27th January 1909. The Padhagiya property sale-deed&amp; stand in the Sheikh's own name, but he informed me that the property known as Mutawiya, which he purchased from Sheikh Sadun of the Muniifich, stands in the names of Hamid -al-Khalid and the Sheikh's sons, Jabir, Salim and Hamed bin Mobarak. The transfer of this Mutawiya property was duly registered in the Tapu Office records, nodifficulty being made presumably because Hamid-al-Khalid had already taken out J a Rationality certificate. The Sheikh said that his sons had not taken out i certificates as is suggested likely in Mr. Crow's despatches quoted above. 11. In discussing the matter, I informed the Sheikh that before His Maiesty 's Ambassador could even be asked to move on his behalf the very fullest information would be necessary, and seeing that all local efforts had 1 apparently been unsuccessful it would be advisable to obtain from Constanti- ! no pi e} perhaps through Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair, details of what had passed I there with regard to the matter. The Sheikh agreed to try and obtain the further information. 12, Meanwhile this report of the present situation is forwarded with the hope that Government being put in possession of all that is available may be able to re-examine a question which presents a very thorny problem and which will require a solution if the independence of the Uuler of Koweit is to mean anything more than the inaccessibility or freedom of his port from Turkish aggression and, it may be added, if our position in Koweit is to be made secure from incessant Turkish intrigue.

The account of his trip given by Shaikh Mubarak to Captain Shakespear is very different from that given in Mr. Crow's report. I have furnished Captain Shakespear with a copy of Mr. Crow's report and asked him to make further enquiries about the matter. It is, however, sufficiently evident that the Shaikh's ' ' .tement that 44 not one word had been broached on the subject of his properties ' is not in accordance with fact. No doubt, however, the Shaikh does emphatic statement that ' properties '' is not in accor&lt; not for a moment think that we believe such assurances. 3 It is evident from Mr. Crow's report that the new Wali of Basrah is trying to ingratiate himself with Shaikhs Khazal and Mubarak. It does not seem desir- able from our point of view that the two chiefs should become too friendly with His Excellency, and I have asked His Majesty's Consul, Basrah to be so good as to let me know if anything further transpires. It is very possible that Shaikh Khazal iindins himself in opposition to the Bakhtiari (and most powerful) element m the Persian Government, may desire to make friends with the Turks but it hardly seems likely that Shaikh Mubarak bemg on such friendly terms with Bin Saud could seriously contemplate any arrangement with the Turks. In fact, it seems possible that Shaikh Mubarak is merely trying to throw dust in the eyes of the Wall. 4.

Subsequently the Shaikh went up to Basrah, and I am unable to say whether calls were again exchanged there, but I believe not, as I am informed that Shaikh Mubarak did not land at the serai (Government House) at Basrah. 4. It is significant that the Shaikh's secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim, has been in Basrah some tim^e now, though on what business I have no information, and that the Shaikh undoubtedly sought to deceive me as to what passed between him and the Wali. 5. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to His Majesty's Consul at Basrah to ask if he can furnish any further light on the subject. (Copy.) No. 14. Basbah ; March 9th 1910. Sir, I have the honour to report that last month the Wali and the Commodore pro ceeded in the ' Marmaris ' to Fao and met Shaikh Mubarak and Shaikh Khazal at the house of Abdul Wahab el Kartass at Saraji a few miles from BasraK The company were entertained at a banquet at which the proceedings were enlivened by the Turkish band. After the meal Abdul Wahab, the host, made a speech which has been reproduced in a local Arabic newspaper the ' Izhar-ul-Hakk.' The speaker after congratulating the Ottoman nation on acquiring freedom and a constitution, said no people had ever done so without gradually progressing to the attainment of the highest happiness, glory and prosperity, and he was convinced Turkey would do the same. He then declared that certain dishonest officials in the past, in order to serve their own ends, had succeeded in estranging Shaikh Mubarak Pasha, Kaimmakam of Kuwait, from his country and his Government, and went on to eulogise the Shaikh in the following terms :— ' Who is Shaikh Mubarak Pasha as Sabah ? He is the free, faithful and zealous Ottoman now among us. Excellencies, we all know him well, and I need not detain you with an account of the Shaikh or his family, whose generous qualities have gained notoriety from the books of Midhat Pasha, the founder of our freedom, while more recently the Shaikh himself has become famous for the lavish manner in which he has contributed both money and assistance, as is attested by the official records of the Government.' The speaker concluded his address ' by attesting to the fact that throughout the course of past events and vicissitudes, the Shaikh has never wavered or changed in his allegiance and fidelity to the Ottoman Government and nation,' and ended by saying ' Long life to Shaikh Mubarak and our beloved neighbour, Sardar Arfa Khazal Khan, who, although a Persian by nationality, conducts himself like an Ottoman in his acts and contributes both efforts and money to the establishment of peace and good order in our dear native land and that more specially in the time ^of the present Wali. ' The party were then photographed, the Wali in the middle with Khazal on bis right and Mubarak on his left, while the speaker, Kartass, stood in the foreground with his back to the camera. I called a few days ago on the author of the speech, 'Abdul Wahab al Kartass, who quite admitted that he had his tongue in his cheek when be delivered it, Mr. Lyle of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., who visited the Shaikh at Kuwait shortly after his trip to Basrah, informed me that Mubarak bad told him that theop: 35 Wali still refused to allow the registration of the transfer of the land he bad pur- cbafsed at Fadaghia unless he took out a certificate of Ottoman nationality. Abdul Wahab Pasha, however, gave me a somewhat different account of the matter. According to him, strict orders have been received from Constantinople not to per mit the registration of the transfer to Mubarakfat all. The reason for this oppo sition to what is really a very ordinary transaction is, so Abdul Wahab informs me that a misconception exists at Constantinople regarding the situation of the land to be transferred, and that the Ministers believe it to occupy an important strategic position commanding Basrah, moreover, they do not think Mubarak is buying the land himself, but that the British Government are financing him in tbe matter. Abdul Wahab says the Wali bad sent in very favourable reports, explaining bow erroneous all this is, but he has not succeeded in overcoming the opposition of the Ministers. As regards the question of the nufus teskere, Abdul Wabab told me this matter could easily be got over by the Shaikh putting the land in the name of his blind son and taking out a certificate of Ottoman nationality for him in order to satisfy Turkish susceptibilities. I informed your Excellency in a previous despatch that Shaikh Mubarak proposed adopting this course when Major Knox and I discussed the matter with him last year at Kuwait. I do not myself think the Wali is as obligingly disposed to settle the question in the way the Shaikh suggests, as Abdul Wabab Pasha would have me believe. As the deputy Ahmed Pasha as Zobeir, the seller of the land, is at Constantinople, he could, no doubt, satisfy the Ministers as to the position of Fadaghia. I think they do not want to let Shaikh Mubarak acquire more ground here for purely political reasons, and the Wali, I think, is not likely to endeavour to induce them to change their minds as he fully appreciates the anomaly of the Shaikh's position and loses no opportunity of having a dig at me about the Kuwait question. Your Excellency may have seen a statement in the Frankfurter Zeitung that Ahmed Pasha Zobeir had sold large tracts of land at Basrah to the British Government. An indignant denial of this was published by Zobeir's brother, Abd-el-Mohsin, President of the Municipality, in the Basrah newspaper 'Izbar-ul-Hakk, but the statement, no doubt, refers to the present transaction and cannot but tend to increase Turkish suspicions. The Wali, however, practises the Turkish, maxim about being afiable to one's friends and dissimulating with one's enemies, and I hear Shaikh Mubanak has ' promised to assist him to get the stone required for his new road by using Kuwait boats to bring the material from Maskat, no charge being made for freight, but the Wali paying the cost of the labour employed. Whether the Kuwait fisher men will approve of this onerous arrangement is another question. In any case the Wali is cultivating good relations with his neighbours ^ as long as he continues on good terms with the powerful Shaih o u r J !l ' m , ' it is unlikely there will be any armed disturbance m the-Vilayet. There have been none of importance this winter. Early last month a i ' who is practically an outlaw, and who seems to have en is e eg of Shaikh Khazal in order to effect a reconciliation with the Val1 ' Mubammerah where he has been staying to Basrah, and asked for P a rdon'saying be was ready to pay arrears of taxes due and to give up ^ ri m-, w to the Turkish Government, to which he expressed ^ municated his application to the Minister of the Interior, u „i v pn him with what result. Falih returned to Muhammerah, the Wall havmg given h -to understand that he would be arrested if he remained here longer than twenty-four hours. Shaikh Khazal has on his side reciprocated by dS ) attitude towards the Wali since his arrival and has no opp -.'ni j ^ | traction of his house property on the municipal scheme now being carried out by the w an tt ® called on laying down a tramway to Basrah. Shaikh Khazal s agent, Mirza Hamza, called on me and made some enquiries as to my own attitude in re S , - t p U i] e( j of the Bohra andKhoja communities on the road whl0 ^ we sta ^ t ; nop ] e down. I told Mirza H^mza that I had been in co' es P ond s e n n f ^tteXfe w 'Ztl e on the subject, and His Marty's ^bassy Ite execution of the Wall s project, and that I had nlimits within which the authorities could claim compliance with their designs without payment and the nature of the compensation which could be demanded under the regulations. The Shaikh's agent took note of the date of the Building law, and I noticed that work was begun on his houses on the following day. I have, etc., (Sd.) F. E. CftOW.

S hakespear, LA, Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your Second Assistant's endorsement No. 725, dated the 20th March 1910. 2. It will be remembered I last reported the Sheikh as informing me that nothing had passed on the subject of the registration of his properties when he met the Wali of Basrah during his visit up-river in February. I have since received acopv of Mr. Consul Crow's despatch No. 14, dated the 9th March 1910, to His Majesty's Ambassador which gives a vastly different account of what passed at the same meeting. After receiving it I took an opportunity of leading the Sheikh back to the subject, when the Sheikh surprised me by giving me an account much the same as Mr. Crow's, apparently completely oblivious Qf its contradiction with what he had already told me. I rallied the Sheikh on Abdul Wahab-al-Kirtas' speech at the banquet, and the Sheikh laughingly replied that such sentiments were the usual accompaniment of similar entertainments and were 'words.' They were useful as keeping the Turkish authorities pleased without being committal. 3. At a subsequent interview, when the Sheikh came to see me immediately after his return from Failiyeh, on the 8th April, he was full of ^ s ® c ° n ^ mee ** n |=' he had just had with the Wali at an entertainment given by Abdul Wahal&gt;al- Kirtas at Seraiji. The Sheikh gave the conversation as follows :--the W ah had condoled with him regarding the reverse suffered at Sheikh Sadun s hands and had then gone on to flatter and compliment him, after which the Wall had explained that the Ministry of the Interior at Constantinople had asked him the following questions :— (1) Had Mubarak bought the Fadhagiya property really himself from Ahmed Pasha Zohair and had he paid the purchase-money ? (2) What was its area and the price paid for it? (3) Whether there were any claims by the State on any of the land ? The Wali said that he had replied to these queries both to the Ministry and to the Grand Vizier as follows :— (1) That Mubarak had paid the price at the time of purchase and had had possession ever since. (2) That the area was 480 ' jaribs ' and the price paid 48,000. (3) That the property was unencumbered and that the State had no lien on it. That Mubarak already held property in the Basrah Vilayet of an estimated value of some four million pounds Turkish.I Having told him so much the Wali had then said that theTapu Office would register the transfers in the Sheikh's name and that of his sons as he desired The Sheikh told me that the Wali did not explain that he acted on any orders from Constantinople, and, though he expected the usual condition to follow, (that of Mubarak's registration as a Turkish subject), no such demand was made by the Wali on this occasion. He therefore metely thanked the Wali and wondered what had brought about the change in his formerly hostile attitude. 4. If the above account is true, and, from the fact that the Sheikh announced in his ' Majlis ' on his return that the Wali had said his properties should be duly registered, I am inclined to think it is, it would seem either that the Ottoman Government has waived its objection of its own motion or that the Wali has really convinced it of Mobarak's bona fides in the purchase; whichever may be the case, the situation seems to have improved considerably. 5. On my enquiring from the Sheikh whether he had asked Abdul Wahab-al- Kirtas to approach the Tapu Office again before the Wali's benevolent attitude should change, he informed me that he had already told him to carry through the transfers, that he would on no account register himself as a Turkish subject though if the difficulty could be got over by registering the names of Nasir (his blind son) and some of his women-folk as Turkish subjects, he would have no objection. I pointed out that in view of the Wali's new attitude this would be unnecessary, and I was almost sure would be regarded by Government as most undesirable. I added I was giving my own view in order that, if he agreed with it himself, he might instruct Abdul Wahab-al-Kirtas not to delay, but that, if he preferred, I could write and obtain your opinion. As the Sheikh expressed himself willing to hear my opinion I went on to point out that the course was undesirable for the following reasons :— (a) none of the Sheikh's other property was registered as belonging to a Turkish subject {i.e., in the name of a person holding a Turkish nationality certificate) with the exception of his Mutawiya gardens as explained in paragraph 10 of my letter No. C.-7, dated the iSih January 1910, {b) that, by taking out a certificate of Turkish nationality for any of his own family, he would create a precedent which had hitherto never existed, (c) that having done so would furnish the Turkish authorities with a strong argument—that as the pro perty is registered in the name of the Sheikh's son and family, and they are Turkish subjects, obviously the Sheikh recognizes himself and his property as entirely subjects to the Turkish Government, {d) that, after his death, the division of his property would present enormous difficulties and probably raise most undesirable questions if portions were found registered in the name of a son holding a Turkish nationality certificate, [e) that such a course might make it exceedingly difficult in the future for the British Government to render him that measure of assistance which they would like and which he might possibly find himself in a position to require. I said that to my mind by far the best course now was for him to ask Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas to make in writing to the Tapu Office formal application (which is his duty under the terms of the sale-deeds) for registration of the transfer as soon as possible. If the registration is effected, well and good, while, if refused, the Sheikh would be in a much better position to know how the case stands either at Constantinople or with the VVali or both, and in any case could be no worse off than at present. 6. The Sheikh appeared to agree with my view but whether he will act as I suggested I do not yet know. I shall take an opportunity of asking him in a few days and will then again report. I was at pains to explain that I was giving my own opinion only and to the best of my ability in the Sheikh's own interests, and trust that the suggestion in the circumstances will meet with your approval.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with my predeces sor's letter No. 143, dated the 13th March 1909, regarding the repair of an embankment on the Sheikh's property near the Turkish fort at Fao. si-. 'or 3 2. When visiting me after his return from a trip up-river at which he had met the Wali of Basrah, the Sheikh informed me that he thought the case of this embankment had at last reached a conclusion. He said that the Wali and the Officer Commanding the troops at Basrah had both been to Fao, had told him that'he was at liberty to _ repair the embankment whenever it should become necessary and had also giyen the Commandant of the Fao Fort strict injunctions that he should not again interfere with similar works on Sheikh Mubarak's properties when they required repairs. 3. There is a rumour also to the effect that the Turkish authorities do not consider the fort of any military value and that the Wali has an idea that it would be of more use if demolished and converted into a school! 4. Sheikh Mubarak said that during the year the'soldiers had been annoying his men at Fao in petty ways, which he had not reported to us as they were of a trifling nature, but he now hoped that he would have no further trouble from the fort.

As you are aware, 1 just missed Sheikh Mubarak in the Shatt-el-Arab on )th April, but I enquired from Sheikh Khazal if he knew what had passed between Sheikh Mubarak and the Wali on the subject of the Fadaghia registration difficulty, and he replied that the Wali was still pressing Mubarak to register in his own name as a Turkish subject, but that the latter was firmly resolved not to do so, but was considering the Qros and cons of registering in the name of his blind son.

It; appears 'b]ni»t/t»he Wall 'when iie first* arrived, in Basraii enquired from the Porte what the attitude of the Turkish Government was in regard to Maskat Bahrain &amp; Kowait Mohammerah. In reply he was told that Mahommerah was undoubtedly Persian terrotory, that the Turkish claims to Maslcat &amp; Bahrain were at present dormant, but that with regard to Kowait there was no question that it was Turkish, &amp; that he should so re^brd it. The Wali is reported on several occasions to have/ publicly expressed his res^ tment at what he called British interference in Kowait affairs. V Mubarak has, so Shaikh Khazal tells me, for some time been the return of the Wali, He went up to Kut el Plrang in his steamer to meet the Wali, &amp; made a great fuss over him . Abdul Aziz bin Salim his private secretary remained all day with the Wali. The latter finally refused to register the lands, unless Mubarak would register all his sons as Turkish subjects. This he refused to do, though he offered his daughters &amp; one son( ICasir) J It seems that Mubarak is now thoroughly disgusted with ohe Turks, &amp; says he will have no more to do with them at all, &amp; that when he comes up the Shatt el Arab hw will go no higher than Failiyah. Shaikh Khazal asked me to tell you that Mubarak was only an Arab, &amp; th t we should not pay too much attention to his lit^e political games, it was just Ms simplicity, I expect Mubarak has asked him to put in a good word on behalf, ag ^ ^ ^ apprehensive of the effect of the aforesaid^games '' working in or^ er to obtain the registration of his Fe ddaghiy:h 1 nds, He had a final try a few days ago, on on us.Or 246 As regards Mubarak 's expedit/ion against the Saadun, Shai^lT Kli-azal tells me that the Sa^dun are being weakened by dissension, % from letters from them that he had seen, they were now afraid of Mubarak, &amp; that if the latter Just ^at still &amp; did nothing, he would be able to get many of the Bedawin Arabs , now ^vith Saadun.to his side, &amp; be able this to break their power &amp; disperse them without firing a shot.

Sheikh Mubarek himself asserts that the Wali has definitely refused to register the property unless he lets his four sons take out Turkish certificates, as ' f ' ' I a preliminary step.

Cox, C.S.L, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— J. B. W ood , Esq., I .C.S., Officiating Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward a further report frorti the Political Agent at Koweit Agency letter No. C.-40, dated the 30th K .OWeit On the Subject of the registration Juae1910 ' # question difficulty, connected with the transfer of Sheikh Mubarak's Eadaghia property, in continuation of the corres pondence ending with Foreign Department Endorsement No. 1290-E.A., dated 21st June 1910, 2. Captain Shakespear's present communication soems to me to confuse two hypotheses, or aspects of the question, which need to be distinguished, and to introduce a third which is new to me. (i) The first of these is that the Vali of Basrah is technically and legally correct in his attitude towards the transfer question (as' Captain Shakespear suggests in paragraph 6 of his letter No. 35 of 8th June) and is merely interpreting against the public, including Sheikh Mubarak, the provisions of a law of general application in the Basrah Vilayat,—a dead-letter under the old regime but strictly enforced under the new,—which permits of no transfer of landed property in the said Vilayat except on the condition that the acquirer declares himself to be of Turkish nationality. (ii) The second hypothesis is that the Vali's attitude is not based on any such law of general application in the Vilayat, but is merely an arbitrary departure from ordinary usage devised in the hope that by throwing Sheikh Mubarak into a state of apprehension lest his bargain should otherwise be upset and himself possibly put to great loss, they will drive him to declare himself or his sons to be of i urkish nationality. (iii) The third and to me new aspect of the question is indicated in para graph 2 of Captain Sbakospear's present report, namely, that the Basrah authorities do not primarily and positively contend that Sheikh Mubarak must necessarily declare Turkish nationality ; he might declare French, English or any other nationality if he enioyed it, but that ^Kweid' is no nationality and that for Sheikh Mubarak Turkish nationality alone is indicated. 3. If the position with which we now have to deal were that indicated in (iii), then it would seem that it might be possible for us to induce the Porte in a friendly way to accept the definition ' Koweiti' as a nationality for purposes of registration in the case of land-transfers, in order to avoid the raising of awkward issues. A recent report, however, from Mobammerah seems to indicate that hypothesis (iii) must be eliminated. Lieutenant W ilson writes that the Sheikh of Mohammerah informs him that the lands in Turkish limits which he purchased last year, known as Umm -el-TuwaiLth (an island above Eaihyeh) have not yet been registered, the present Vali having refused to permit it, and i that the Sheikh has decided to wait on events and let the registration remain m abeyance until he sees what action we are going to take to see Sheikh Mubarak through his present difficulty. It would appear, therefore, that it is either contingency (i) or (ii) with which we have to reckon. In the former case, if we make enquiries from the Porte they wiU probably reply that their Vali's action is not directed against Sheikh Mubarak but is merely the interpretation of existing land-laws appli cable to the Basrah Vilayat; that Sheikh Mubarak is under n0 buy property in the Basrah Vilayat, but that, if he does, he must fulflHhe same preliminaries and conditions as other persons ; and that unless he complies the transfer cannot berecogniscd by the Turkish Courts and so the . P r °P® rt y be considered as still belonging to the persons in whose name it has hitherto stood. We should then he confronted with the issue indicated in the concluding paragraph of my letter of 19th June. 4. If on the other hand the position indicated in (ii) is the one with which we have to deal, the issue is simpler and we seem to have objecting on the ground that the invidious treatment of Sheikh Mubarak and the2 departure from past usage involved, constitutes an infringement of tbe stahx* quo in regard to Koweit affairs which the Porte has undertaken to observe. The Mohammerah report above mentioned, however, seems to point to hypo thesis (!) as the correct one. 5. It goes without saving that I entirely endorse the Political Agent's view that if the main question, of the status of Koweit is involved we have everything to lose by delaying to face the issue, and that the longer we d.o so, the more difficult will it become to get it settled in the way we desire. No: 0.-40 (Conf-deatial), dated Koweit, the SOtli June 1910. From— Q aptain W. H. 1.; S hakespbab ,, I.A., Palitical A ^eat, Koweit, To—1 jexjtenant -C olonel P Z. Cox, C.S.I., OiLB.', • Political- Resident.in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the correspondence covered by your Second Assistant's endorsements Nos, 1652 and 1668, dated 21st and 22nd June 1910 respectively. 2. I would first correct a possible misunderstanding to which the latter part of paragraph 6 of my letter No C.-35, dated the 8th June 1910, may give rise. When I said ' Turkish nationality 'VI meant the sentence to apply only to Mubarak and Koweitis for of course other nationalities such as English^ Eteneh, etc., are accepted, but in the case of Koweitis, the Turkish officials will not accept *' Koweit but insist on ' Turkish ' nationality. 3. With reference to your better No. 1650, dated 19th June 1910, to the Government of Indi h andje-specially to paragraph '6 thereof, I wi u'd venture to submit the following observations resulting from a thorough discussion of the whole subject with His Majesty's Consul at liasrah In your letter you f( r see the possible alternative of advising Sheikh Mubarak to re-sell ihe property and of having to indemnify him for any loss thereon. With all deference I would venture to deprecate any such course and for the following reasons (а) The Sheikh is certainly alarmed about this property^ but at the same time I am inclined to think now he is not improbably exaggera ting that alarm for our special benefit as a means of forcing our hand tp free him from Turkish attentions. (б) Mr. Consul Crow considers that the possiblity of the sale being repudiated is an extremely remote one seeing that the sale deeds bear the signatures of most of the notables of Basrah as well as the cachet of the British Consulate. (c) The property is so large that a buyer would be difficult to find who would purchase it as a single lot and there is besides the grave objection in the advice of a re-sale of an appearanqe. of weakness on ourpart. in sustaining the Sheikh's claim. 4. In my humble opinion it would be far more advantageous to maintain the position of our special interests in Koweit, the Sheikh's long-continued in dependent status, whilst pressing npon the Porte that the recognition of Koweit as a nationality should suffice for the ' Tapu ' Office. 'J he Porte is, I adinit, not likely to agree, biit as there seems no immediate risk of the Sheikh losing his property, it would seem worth while to state the above as defining to some extent what is the actual status quo in Koweit. 5. The question of the status of Koweit must come up before many years, and it seems fairly obvious that the Turkish officials have realised the powerful lever they possess for raising that issue in the registration question, which goes directly to the root of the matter on the point of nationality. The regis tration of any of Mubarak's family, whether the women or sons, would seem undesirable as likely to admit the principle that Koweit nationality is unrecog nisable as against Turkish, f or tlie same reason the taking out of Turkish *• Teskerehs'' by Koweit subjects is to be deprecated, and though the Sheikh denies it I hear from other sources that many Koweitis with business or land in Basrah have already done this. Uhder the new order of things this practice is likely to grow and in a few years hence it seems to me there will be far greater difficulty in insisting on the independence of Koweit than is the case at present, and it is for that reason that I would urge that .the question should not be avoided. , w</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c9_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/484</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c9</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/484</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 53/11 II (D 11) Kuwait: Sheikh's Fao Properties, 1905-1910'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1904/1910</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-02-22T00:00:52</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (291 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.An index of topics discussed in the file is contained on folio 1c.</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation sequence in this file commences at the front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are typed (with additions and clarifications in ink or pencil), and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
