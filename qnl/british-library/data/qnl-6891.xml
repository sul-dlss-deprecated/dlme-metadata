(Note by India Office.) the peace negotjationa regarding the Middle East are uot to be a failure, it seems to ine absolutely essential that His Majesty's Government should, without lurtner delay, lay down for the British delegation the main lines of their policy. I venture to put the case somewhat strongly, because there are manifest signs of a tendency to sacrifice Mesopotamia and British and local interests there to diplomatic exigencies in Syria ; and at present the India Office is responsible for the interests of JMesopotamia. Ihe points on which a decision is essential are these :— (i) 7he Status of the King of the llejaz. —Is he to be suzerain of the whole Arab territory as defined in our negotiations with him and in the Sykes- I icot Agreement ? Or is he merely to be primus inter pares? It this question is to be answered on the basis of local option, it is certain that no one m the Arabian peninsula (except possibly Bin Rashid) and few in Iraq will vote for Xing Husain's suzeraintv. (ii) Ihe Status oj Iraq. As regards this, His Majesty's Government have approved the proposals made in Sir P. Cox's memorandum of 22nd April last as the basis of their policy in Iraq. Sir P. Cox proposed as the ideal fassummg annexation to be out ot the question) 'government by a high Commissioner assisted by a Council, formed partly of the ^ heads of the most important departments of State, and partly of ' representative non-official members from among the inhabitants,' foreign relations being in British hands. But 'if it is decided that we should have a nominal headpiece to the administration to conduct his own iillairs under British guidance .... we have in the Naqil) of Baghdad and his family a dynastic element which would ' carry the necessary moral sanction, in the Baghdad Vilayet un- ' doubtedly, and in my opinion in Iraq as a whole. I believe they could be brought to identify themselves with British interests.' His Majesty's Government have not decided between those alternatives, but they must decide which they prefer and which they intend to put forward at the Conference. The question is therefore urgent. For another reason also, ihe Anglo-French declaration presumably com mits us to taking the vote of representatives of the various communities in the country. Oar officers must therefore be pfeparing the ground in order to secure the vote we wish, and they must therefore have instructions. The urgent necessity for this is shown by the Civil Commissioner's telegrams 9906 of the 16th and 992r) of the 17th November 1918, which not only show the confusion into which he and the pro-British sections of the population have been thrown by the Anglo-French declaration, but also suggest that if ire do not prepare the ground, others w T ill local Muhammadan gentry .... are ' already announcing to Jews and Christians that they will shortly see themselves once more under Muhammadan domination,'' &amp;c.). 3. It seems not improbable from such evidence as is available that we might get a British Protectorate, in the sense of Sir P. Cox's first alternative, accepted in Iraq, if we worked for it at once. But presumably we have to consider the effect that this would have on Franco-Arab relations in Syria and the French sphere. A British Protectorate in Iraq would be interpreted by the French as entitling them to a protectorate in Syria, if they could get the Arabs to vote for it; and the Arabs would round on us for betraying them to the French. 1 This is an important consideration, 1 The idea that we can get the French out of Syria by an appeal to local option under the Anglo- French declaration seems to me visionary, unless the League of Nations or some other outside force imposes this upon them ; nor do I see that we have any particular interest in getting the French out of Syria. 10 S t&gt; 40 11/18but I submit that it is not conclusive.' The material interests involved in Mesopotamia are far too great to be jockeyed away merely fpr the sake ol diplomatic convenience. We are not pledged to King Husain to prevent the French from establishing a protectorate: our pledges relate only to those areas in which we can act without detriment to French interests, and we ought to take our stand fniim ( n that giound, aud not allow ourselves to be used by the Arabs to secure their interests in byna at the expense of the French. That, however, is what we are doing atpieseut, and in doing it we risk losing the fruits of the Mesopotarnian campaign for the beaux yeux of King Husain and his scheming sons. 4 But it may be impossible on other grounds to put forward an avowed British Protectorate at the Peace Conference. In that case we must work for Sir P Cox 's second alternative-real British control behind the facade of an Arab ruler and we must have our candidate ready and take the necessary steps to secure his acceptance in Iraq. The candidate who at present holds the'field is the Naqib of Baghdad but at the eleventh hour Lieutenant-Colonel Lawrence lias come home with a proposal to put one of the sons of King Husain in as King of Iraq, and another as Kiuo- of Northern Mesopotamia with his capital at Mosul or Ras-el-Am. Although i am not aware that anything has occurred since the Eastern Committee accepted Sir P. Cox's proposal last spring to cause them to alter their decision, something must be said about Colonel Lawrence's proposal. o. And in the first place, without in the least wishing to depreciate Colonel Lawrence 's achievements and his undoubted genius, it must be said about him that he does not at all represent— and would not, I think, claim to represent—the local views of Northern Mesopotamia and Iraq; of the latter, indeed, he has practically no first-hand knowledge at all, and if His Majesty's Government want to know what they are they will naturally turn to the Civil Commissioner and his officers. 6. As to their views there is little doubt. Sir P. Cox was asked the definite questions: 'Can any Arab authority be discovered, dynastic or representative, that ' will command the necessary moral sanction in [Mesopotamia] as a whole ? What &lt;s weight does King Husain or his family carry with the local Arabs ? ' His answer to the first has already been quoted— he considered that the Naqib of Baghdad and his family possess the necessary qualifications. To the second he replied : ' King Husain ' and his family carry no weight in Iraq, where only the most distant interest is 44 taken in him' ; and he said : ' I cannot see the least justification or necessity for introducing one of the family ' as local potentate. The recognition accorded to the Sherif, writes Miss Bell, ' is of the most, tenuous kind. The respect which his name ' undoubtedly arouses is given to him as a religious luminary, the first in Islam, not u as a political leader.' She points out that though ' there have been individual instances of his being regarded as the centre of Arab unity,' they have occurred not among the better instructed town population, but among the tribes and provincial saiyids' and among Shiahs looking to a potentate who is more than suspected of Shiah leanings. If these views are correct—and there is no reason to doubt it--it is clear that Abdullah, who is personally unknown in Mesopotomia, would find in his father's prestige a very weak claim to acceptance ; and if, as appears to be the case, Lieutenant-Colonel Lawrence's scheme further contemplates the eventual succession to King llusain of his son Ali, whose Sunni orthodoxy is undoubted, even that slender claim would disappear. 7. The fact is that the scheme presupposes a solidarity which does not exist, and which we have no interest in encouraging. The outlook of east and west Arabia is widely different in this respect. ' When the Shaikhs of the Beni Hasan,' says Miss Bell, ' write of uniting the Arab nation, it can be confidently affirmed that the ' words convey no definite political conception. They are not indeed in a position ' to form one. Their political horizon is bounded by Baghdad and Kufah ; Anmrah ' and Basra are almost outside the circle of their interest, to say nothing of Syria or 44 Morocco. But in Baghdad itself, where alone there are men who have a hearsay ' acquaintance with the Arab world beyond Mesopotamia, there exists a deep seated • jealousy of Arabs who are not of local birth.' As an example she quotes their dislike of Syrians, and adds : ' Patriotism, as can be remarked in any part of the 41 Arab provinces, is strictly local, when it leaves the realm of windy phrase-making and comes to practical applications.' \\ ith this may be compared what CaptainWilson says in his telegram 9926 of the 17tli November: ' If the future status of this ;j ^ 011 n 3 15 ^ )(&gt; \MtIi successfully, it must, I am convinced be treated ' independently of Arab problems elsewhere. Arabs of Mesopotamia will not tolentp ' that Arabs from elsewhere should have any say in their affairs, whether they come •• from Syria or from Hejaz. In practice they dislike and distrust both. NationaT ' unity means for them united Mesopotamia, and not unity with eilher Syria or ' Hejaz' And Sir P. Cox had already said: 'The Naqib of Baghdad considers himself superior in purity of descent and nobility to the Sherif, and no less ' important; and the introduction of a relative of the Sherif of Mecca as head of the '' State of Iraq would, in my opinion, be greatly misunderstood and resented by the ' Naqib and his family, and thus tend to alienate our most potent element of influence ' over the Arabs of Iraq.' 8. These are the views of our responsible oflicers, and if they are correct (and there is no new evidence to make them less correct that when the Eastern Committee approved Sir P. Cos's proposals in April last) Shereef Abdullah would not be accepted by the Arabs of Iraq as King, and would greatly embarrass us. His candidature, therefore, seems to have nothing to recommend it. 9. As regards the proposal to carve out a kingdom of Northern Mesopotamia under Shereef Zeid, we have no evidence as to the feelings of the local Arabs, tribal or urban, towards his person ; but the creation of a separate independent or'quasi- independent kingdom would obviously be highly inconvenient. Captain Wilson has recently been emphasising the close connection, economic and political, which exists between the vilayets of Mosul and Baghdad. It was very unfortunate that the Sykes- 1'icot Agreement assigned the former to France, and a strong endeavour is to be made to get France out. Clearly an Arab kingdom under England would be much less incon venient than one under France, but three serious disadvantages may be mentioned :— (1) We do not yet know how close our control over these Arab kings ' is to be, and, in any case, we are avowedly working for a time when it is to disappear altogether : if Mosul were a separate kingdom there would be no sufficient guarantee of that close and friendly co-operation which is necessary to secure the most important interests of Baghdad and Basra (e.g., irrigation); (2) the whole mechanism of British control or administration would have to be duplicated ; (3) the Sykes-Picot Agreement divided Kurdistan into three, and this undesirable partition would remain. The seat of control would naturally lie in the Kingdom of Mosul, but the Kurds extend across the Kingdom of Iraq. This would greatly hinder the unification and confederation of Kurdistan, which is so important for the peace alike of Armenia and Mesopotamia. 10. It is submitted, therefore, that Colonel Lawrence's scheme has nothing to commend it so far as Mesopotamia and Iraq are concerned, convenient as it may be as a means of providing for the embarrassing ambitions of King Husain's other two sons, when Ali has been installed at Mecca and Feisal at Damascus. 11. Captain Wilson's telegrams 990G and 992G of IGth and 17th November, were received after the first part of this Memorandum had been written. I need hardly say that 1 share his apprehensions if the Anglo-French declaration means what he thinks. In any case, those who are now responsible for Iraq are bound to protest against any sacrilice of the interests of the Arabs of Iraq to those of the Arabs of Syria or elsewhere. As I have already said, I cannot see that we are bound by honour or interest to defend the Arabs against the French. That the French will allow themselves to be eliminated from Syria by any local option under the declaration—or that, if they do, they will allow us to take their place, as some imagine—is surely incredible. Syria is too deeply graven on the heart of France for that. If we support the Arabs in this matter, we incur the ill-will of France, and we have to live and work with France all over the world. We have no interests of our own in Syria at all commensurate with those in Mesopotamia ; and if we had, and could eliminate the French in our own favour, could we possibly undertake the control of Syrian politics and administration in addition to our responsibilities in Mesopotamia and the Arabian peninsula ? 12. And if we cannot eliminate the French from Syria, neither can we weaken -their hold there without, pro tanto, weakening our hold over Mesopotamia. But if Mesopotamia is to be developed, our control of the administration must be complete,for only so (to put it at its lowest) will the capital necessary for its development be forthcoming. Now, as I ventured to say when first writing on this subject nearly four years^ago, ' the Power whicli detaches these regions from the Ottoman Empire ' cannot stop at that. By its action it has made itself morally responsible to ' humanity and to civilisation for their reclamation and development; that is to say 4&lt; it must either undertake the work itself or make it possible for others to do so.' It may be that a League of Nations will decide on the latter olternative. But in the meantime we dare not gamble away our responsibility loi tlie sake ol aii\onc s dreams in Syria. 13. But there is, in fact, nothing inconsistent between the Anglo-French declaration and Sir P. Cox's proposals accepted by the Eastern Committee ; and I submit that His Majesty's Government should at once pronounce themselves accordingly for the guidance both of the British delegation at the Peace Conference and of the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, and that the latter should be instructed to beain propaganda at once with a view to winning local acceptance of and, if possible, demand for, British administration of the vilayets of Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, with a view to eventual self-government.
