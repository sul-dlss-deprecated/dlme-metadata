The Catholic Church Bahrain 2 ?th. August 1947 The Adviser to the G-overraent of Bahrain Bear Sir, I regret to bring to your notice the following fact, Sonie Araos, children or adults I do not know, wishing to make a nuisance of themselves have thrown heavy black oil on the church door thus leaving a large dirty patch on it. The door looks horr riole. The ooeps in front of the church have been splashed with the dirty oil too, I noticed some arab children playing on the church steps and the same c hildien who live just oppositej^the church once came into the compound and left the water tap in my compond open, I wonder whether it could be the same children who are up to mischief, I shall be very much obliged if you could*whatever is within your power to stop this sort of a thing happening again. I am Tours respectfully ( Pr. Anselm. )</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00012a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1563</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00012a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1563</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 16/52 Correspondence regarding building of Catholic Church in Bahrain’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-07-14T23:18:12</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (7 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.
