Situation Report No.37. 25,000 people are reported to have migrated to Khorasan already owing to famine conditions in Qainat. This figure is known to be exaggerated and probably 10/12 thousand is more correct. 25,000 Kharwars wheat have been promised from Khorasan but nothing as far as is known has yet been sent. It is reported that sheep, cattle and other animals including plough animals have been moved to Khorasan. These are being bought by Russians for export to Russia and it is feared that if this goes on there will be insufficient stock left for- breeding purposes and sowing, of next year's crop will be seriously affected by shortage of plough animals. 2. Tudeh newspapers continue to publish anti-British articles. Latest one states British are despatching wheat from Zabul to Quetta. This is malicious lie obviously put across because interested persons want the people to believe that wheat is being removed from Sistan to India when the people in neighbouring province are dying of starvation. I am bringing this article to the notice of the Ustandar.4 'k'T 3. It is understood that surplus grain in Sistan is required for Kerman province where there is a shortage. 4.

FROM TEHRA N TO FOREIGN OFFICE D, 4,10 p.m. 28th January, 1946, R. 5,15 p.m, 28th January, 1946, Repeated to British Middle East Office, Cairo' Bagdad Basra Government of India Moscow SAVING sssss I Tehran representative of African and Eastern Company has been asked by his Basra colleague whether barley can be bought in Persia for export* The enquiry is on behalf of British authorities. I have told him that in my opinion no cereals ought to be exported from Persia unless Persian Government have officially declared a [grp. undec.?surplus] and indicated area where purchases may be made. My reasons are as follows. 2. To prevent such famines as used to occur (partly from transport difficulties, but at least as much from greed of landlords and merchants) and to ensure bread supply throughout the country Reza Shah introduced the present system under which buyers [grp. undec.] wheat and barley to ensure sufficiency in deficit areas. This system requires careful estimates for the next year or two and these might be seriously upset by private buying. The sanction of the Persian Government to export privately, cereals, would not only safeguard Persian consumers but also protect that eternal scapegoat the British Government from isfrom the charge of starving the Persians. The above reasons are of general application hut there are also particular reasons applicable at the present moment viz. 1) The Government’s collection of cereals in 1945 was carried out inefficiently owing, partly at least, to the inevitable diminution in British liaison staff, and the splendid reserve of a year ago which had been built up by British and American help has fallen off considerably. 2) If Persia has any grain to spare she should first implement the promise made in [grp. undec. ?October] to supply U.N.R.R.A. with grain as to nine-tenths of promised donation of ten million rials. 3) So long as political deadlock continues, Persian Government will be unable to collect 45,000 tons of wheat which it claims to hold in Azerbaijan. 4) Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who need 6,000 tons of wheat for their employees, have been told by the Persian authorities that only 3,000 can be spared (this is absurd but must be taken into account). 5) So far, the crop prospects for 1946 are not good. 6) Persistent rumours are current and believed, that the British are 'taking all grain'. This tale has always been fostered by the Russians who find particular pleasure in diverting attention from their own crimes by fastening false accusations on others. 3. I trust you will approve. If you do I suggest we should let our official attitude be known.

M.E.S.C.O. here with full approval pf His Majesty s Embassy recently submitted a demand through Cairo to Washington which the United States Embassy repeated to the State Department, and supported for release to Persia during 1944 pf some 100 ten ton trucks, urgently required for haulage of grain harvest during the winter. The following points were made in justification and we believe that they still apply: (a) Persia has not received any new heavy haulage vehicles during last four years. (b) adequate supplies of spare parts have not been available to maintain civilian operated trucks efficiently (c) last year it was necessary to obtain assistance from P.A.I.C. P.G.[grp.undec.?C.] and U.K.C.C. to haul approximately 50,000 tons of grain from collecting point in growing areas to points of consumption or railheads. Similar assistance is not'likely to be forthcoming this year. (d) the rate of mortality in civil fleet is increasing rapidly. U.K.C.C. who operate the best of civil heavy load-carriers do not believe that their fleet will be fit for long distance haulage work after the end of the year, (e) this year's grain harvest is estimated at 575,000 tons of which about 70,000 tons will require haulage over distances of 400/500 miles to deficient areas. 5. Washington has replied to M.E.S.C.O.'s demand to the effect that no heavy haulage vehicles are available for shipment during this year. In these circumstances we foresee the possibility 4.of a critical situation arising during the winter unless some form of assistance is forthcoming and we believe that the acquisition of UJt.C.C, White .trucks would go a long way towards solving the problem. r ■ * * * • '5.

Kjujtc/ /o: — y*y. /*?/?xr«rtS. (/. /s. c. c. 3 3 3 During rocent discussions between Dr„ Millspaugh, American and British Embassies apd Middle'East Supply ' Centre regarding grain collection prospects for 1944/1945, following facts emerged; (a) With an unusually good harvest as 1943, Persian G-overnment will enter next harvest year with a small reserve of only about 25,000 tons. ■ (b) This reserve could have, been larger by at least another_18,000 tons if north-western provinces in Soviet occupation, especially Azerbaijan and Zenjan, hut''also '■ Khorassan to some extent had contributed even their minimum expected share. / (c) In southern areas of country joint Anglo-American efforts have produced results 25 per cent in excess of original target. (d) Expectations for 1944/1945 are at most not the average^harvest for the country as a whole, but in Azerbaijan and Zenjan again good harvest is expected. t 2. With smaller harvest in view Dr, Millspaugh is afraid unless something is done immediately to establish public confidence, large scale hoarding may make collections difficult. To forestall this Dr. Millspaugh v/ishes for an early guarantee^from the Allies on iines of 1942 grain agreement, but including adherence of Soviet Government. He also feels that along with guarantee Allies should make^an early shipment of about 10-000 tons of grain to Persia. This actual delivery would (a) further aid in establishing confidence and help for collections and (b)^ enable Persian G-overnment further to reduce grain prices (which in any case it is proposed to reduce by about 10 per cent) with a very wholesome effect on economy of the country as a whole. If nob actually needed by Persia, this amount could later be returned to the Allies or, if desired, to their armies [gp, undec,] etc. While we agree with Dr, Millspaugh that such a would be desirable, we understand from Middle assuming HL. -imperative that full Soviet co-operation with Persian Government/vjOV'ornmeno should he secured to ensure collection and despatch to Tehran of at least 25,000 tons out of the next ^ryest froni Azerbaijan and Zenjan ( an amount well v/ithin iheir capacity vide paragraph 1 (d) above). One of the mam reasons for disappointing results in the north last year was that foreign advisers of Persian Government were not allowed access to or free movement in Soviet zone, inis tgp, undec.i it necessary for a proper organisation d 5 ( m co ~ ( ?rd lna ti o n of grain collecting and supply activities of rersian Government. It is true that Russians have jast given a permit of three months to an American employee pi Bread and Cereals section to work in Azerbaijan, but there is no guarantee that this more liberal attitude will oe maintained and three months limit does not augur well ior gram collections in that area. 4. Tosum up it would appear that if the times Pi' n ^ --m npp&lt; WSBm .7ere normal Persia could feed herself in 1944/1945 but m present circumstances and with serious shortage , anticipated m south Persia this year, the Allies are laced with the following alternatives either (a) to mu ma ximum surplus grain is moved from northern zone to Tehran (b).to import grain from abroad or ^c; to allow certain [gp. undec: ?southern] districts’ to face starvation. tt - 4 . x similar telegram has been addressed by Jnited States Embassy to Washington, [Copies sent to Hr.

There are approximately 60 days stocks in the Tehran silo and out of a target of 310,000 tons required to feed the towns till next harvest, over 300,000 tons have actually been collected. The figure of 310,000 tons, however, does not allow for the reserve which the Persian Government ought to possess to enable them to carry on without risk until grain from the 1944 crop is lying m the silos in adequate quantities. The prospects for the coming crop are not good. Grain has been scanty so far, and the black market price of grain is rising. 2. Collections in the central and southern areas as a whole have exceeded expectations. Those in the north have however been indifferent, and in Azerbaijan in particular most unsatisfactory. Azerbaijan should have sent to Tehran, as the Russians themselves agreed, at least 18,000 tons, but by the second week in March it had despatched only 700 tons. 3. The late Soviet Ambassador stated to me on two occasions that the Russians did not require wheat from Persia in 1943/44. I now learn however that the Soviet authorities require 11,000 tons of barley and 3,500 tons of wheat from Persia this year. The barley is unlikely to prejudice the Persian Government's bread situation unless wheat collections are eventually so short as to necessitate an increase in the degree of adulteration with barley. The 3,500 tons of v/heat on the other hand, especially when coupled with unsatisfactory deliveries from the north as a whole will prove a serious loss to the Persian Government. I understand however that the Persian Government have refused to make a contract for this quantity and have merely promised to deliver wheat to the Soviet authorities, to a maximum of 5,500 tons, as and when they can.. up _ - 6=&gt;ftOeX fe ‘Tw [Oopias sent to Mr.Wiltshire}.

The target figure for December for the lift of civil goods from the ports was agreed with Movements and Persian Gulf Command at bOOO as against a previous 8000 tons in view of essential additional cereals lift from intermediate stations of 9610 tons making a total target for civil lift in December (excluding civil oil) of 15,610 tons against which actual performance was 4046 from the ports and \ 73°^ cereals-total 11,407 tons. Failure to reach target figure ex \j. southern ports was mainly for the reasons* given in paragraph 7 of £ Ko# 15 of 5 th January though this time railway operating 'r' ^faculties were also encountered as a result of particularly heavy ^ ^ Aid-to-i^ussia programme whinh i t-, Q + A . , _ . — ^ ax ox liJlciX JL,y iieav civil 0 nft Sia programrfle which resulted in a shortage of waggons for I consider that the existing co-operation between the M.E.S.C. who are responsible for the demands made for civil rail allotment. British Movements and P.G.C. is working smoothly. The position is under constant review. For instance, the target figure from ports for January was again placed at 6000 tons in agreement with British P- t -C. in consideration of (a) cereals programme of 5 00 tons from intermediate stations, and (b) abnormal civil oil programme to meet unexpectedly heavy winter consumption. However owing to a gap in Aid-to-Russia arrivals towards the end of January it became possible to load much more than the 6000 tons envisaged and in all some 7395 tons were moved. The target figure for February has been set at 9000 from the ports and 36 OO tons cereals from intermediate stations-total 12,600 tons. k* 4 . T°^ r P® ra &amp; r &amp;ph 3 figure for (d) includes tonnage at Bushire ut excludes bandar Abbas. The reason for excluding stocks at latter port was that total stock was required for distribution in that vicinity, whereas it is planned to move a proportion of the goods from ushire to Khorramshahr for railing northwards. In order that future reports on stocks at Gulf ports may be more clear, I intend to give &gt;5&lt; total figure of goods in all the Gulf ports broken down into Q?ov&gt; the g S? ds in Bandar Abbas and Bushire and tc) goods in Bandar bnahpur, Khorramshahr and Ahwaz. Thus it will be only the tonnage s own under vc) which will require rail transport northwards. At the end of January the following goods were In Customs Khorramshahr 9042 tons Ahwaz ‘ 129 tons Bandar Shahpur nil tons TOTAL 9171 tons 0ffi ° er in Khorramshahr reported the position was such that there might even be insufficient goods cleared or r M ? I/* e, y-u— *•-I mm v — mm. —mm available for loading at Khorramshahr to fill the 6000 tons of rail waggons allocated to that port. The reason for this possible shortage of goods offering ft moveiuent northwards is that the tonnage of goods in Customs doe.? not necessarily represent the quantity of goods awaiting rail '** transport northwards, as some of, the goods will be released for consumption in the neighbourhood, and other goods are held up awaiting various clearance formalities, either because papers are missing, owners are unknown, or goods are damaged and require special negotiations before disposal arrangements can be effected. A specific item which is held up in Customs at present is 1500 tons of raw cotton awaiting sanitary certificates from countries of origin. However, in view of your concern that the ports should be cleared as rapidly as possible, I intend to ask Dr. Millspaugh to allow where possible, goods awaiting clearance formalities to be moved under passavant to Ahwaz or Tehran pending final settlement. At present, there is no congestion at Khorramshahr and ample storage facilities are available comprising five main transit sheds, each of 2500 tons capacity all of which are available for the storage of Persia^ civil goods, with the exception of one shed, and this the P.G.C. have undertaken to release within the next few weeks. In addition, there are a number of smaller godowns with a total storage capacity of approximately 5000 tons, as well as a large amount of space which can be used for the storage of goods out in the open under tarpaulins, and it is in these that the majority of goods at present awaiting clearance are stored. At Ahwaz there are two main transit sheds, each of 3000 capacity total 6000 tons. 4. The relevant portions of this telegram have been discussed with and agreed by the American Director of Customs, who wishes to to be reported that in his opinion the greatest single contribution that could be made to the problem of rapid clearance of goods from ports ?/ould be if the Shipping Agents could (a) ensure that relevant papers accompanied all gpods landed in Persia as at the present time there is frequently a lapse of weeks before papers covering such goods are received, and (b) if some form of forward advice of arrivals could be given. I have asked the M.B.S.C. Representative to discuss both these problems with the Ministry of War Transport Representative, Basra, at first opportunity. 5. Your paragraph 5. In view of the foregoing information I feel that there is nothing in regard to the present position of stocks and storage accommodation at ports, nor in the railing of goods northwards, to justify delaying or decreasing any shipments of civil goods destined for Persia: neither is there any factor in this position which should be allowed to prejudice the possibility of an increased supply of consumer goods which is so ' • urgently required if inflation in this country is to be held in check.■■■ ty - I 2k i K- ♦'* r ! / it- I '~1AA DEPARTMENTAL No. 2 FRON TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE Sir R.

IMPORTANT Ynnr e grnin NiiTn bRr 11 I am now able to give a much clearer picture regarding the existing stocks at Gulf ports thanks to the perseverance and hard work of some of Middle East Supply Centre officials, Captain Holroid in particular, and the Director General of Customs. Position regarding stocks is as follows: (a) Bunder Abbas. Goods in Customs at December 17th about 2.110 tons which includes 1500 tons Government sugar for distribution ’.n South-East Persia. (b) Bushire. Goods in Customs at October 11th about 80,500 tons 9 This includes 4,000 tons of Government sugar and 1800'tons of raw cotton. Since October 11th^900^tons of ^ . cotton have been moved to Isfahan. The possibility of using dhows to.transport 4,000 to 5,000 tons of these goods to Khoramshahar is under consideration. ' . r (c) Khoramshahar. Goods in the Customs at December 24th about 9489 tons. Figure includes 4,000 tons of Government sugar which is gradually being railed northwards. Private tonnages include 1800 tons of cotton, 200 hessian cloth and gunny, 500 paper and 800 chemicals. d) Tehran. &gt;,926 tons. Goods in the Customs at November 22nd totalled 2. Stocks of principal commodities. (a) Sugar. Stocks held by Government and U.K.C.C ..on November 30th at Tehran, Khoramshahar, Bunder Abbas and Bushire amounted to 14,000 tons.

Monopoly holds 28*000 bales In addition tin (D Cotton-piece goods, mainly Indian goods. In addition there were 4,000 bales of Persian cloth in Government textile factory stores on December 7th. (2) Russian imports to private merchants have averaged 600 bales per mensem.v -2- (3) Private^factories produced yarn and cotton-piece goods equivalent to b,550 bales:.p' , er mensem. (4) Out of Indian quota for 1043 of 10 y 000 bales per annum, the Persian Government has taken 1,000 bales by September. - ’ ■ ihey hoped to -take a further 4,500 before ‘the end of the year.

T-Tove iber 1943. The general sitnatlon changed very little during November. Total collections in the Southern zone increas ed in the course of the lonth to approximately 199,000 tons, against estimated minimum annual requirements of some 120,000 tons for local consumption and 50,000 tons for Tehran. In tne ortiiern zone they now stand at ,'00 tons, against min imum annual requirements of 90,000 tons for local consumption and 40,000 tons for Tehran. 2. Stocks of grain in the Tehran silo remained nearly stationary at between 10 and 11,000 tons.

The move beg- on ITovember 9th and by the end of' the month 3,200 tons had been despatched - all to Sultanabad for onward transport by rail - an avera-e lift of 145 tons a day. 5. Arrangements for the transport of grain from Hamadan to S'ultanabad by Persian Army trucks have been less successful. An average of only tons a day reached Tehran from this source and the arrangements were eventually cancailed alto gether towards the end of the month. The Persian Army trucks are now to be moved to Shiraz, to carry grain from there to tne railway at Qum, whilst a further two companies of British ■irn'V Gr,Uck S are to be bl&gt;ol] Sht into use, to move approximately 1..U tons of gram day from Hsmadan to Sultanabad, or direct Dec ©tribe r™??!!?

This ingenious provision may do much to limit t * le lar&gt;rn iul effect of purchases by private individuals. Private purchasers will undoubtedly pay more for their grain than the government price, and they will also not scruple, where con venient, to -&gt;uy from landowners who have failed to complete tneir undertakings, but as long as they are not given permits gram - permits which in this country would inevitably ,-e used over and over again before being cancelled - the volume .i tneir purchases should net be such as to interfere too sTr~~’ lously with purchases on Government account. 10. pettier it be that rivate buyers are content with this compromise or raerely tha the 13th Majlis has come tc an end, tne lehran ress is n. l.nger using the inferior quality of the Z/axw-LM rVt a i i0 r ^ ^ ich to be * Or-.Milfspau/ ?nto loa-axm^ his control of the grain market.

(E 7706/36/34). No. E 452 (03 146/41/43). fU Sir, 3.. i* -i I have the honour to report that a new Regulation was published on the 7th November, 1943, governing the carriage of civil goods by road transport. This Regulation is No.F5, P4, M3 in the series of Regulations promulgated by the Price Stabilisation Section under the Millspaugh Special Powers Law of the 4th May, 1943. It supercedes the articles relating to the transport of civil goods by road and the operation of civil motor lorries in the existing Road Transport Board Regulations formulated by the Road Transport Board in November, 1942, and reported in my despatch No. E 421 of the 10th December, 1942. 2. The present Regulation, a copy of which is enclosed, is based on recommendations made by a special sub-committee set up by Dr. Millspaugh comprising representatives of the British and American Legations, the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, the Middle East Supply Centre, Tehran, and the Persian Government Road Transport Department, which worked in ^ close contact with the Road Transport Board. 3. Simultaneously with the publication of this Regulation, the Government and the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation both announced a general increase in the rate paid to their contractors from 1.25 Rials to 1.55 Rials per ton-kilometre, with higher rates for certain categories of work and for operating in certain parts of the country where the roads are bad. 4. This Regulation is more severe than the corresponding articles in the existing Regulations that it supercedes. Its effectiveness will depend, however, on the degree of control of civil road transport that can now be enforced, particularly in the provinces. If control can be properly organised a considerable improvement should take place in the civil road transport position; and it is hoped that thecalls on the Allied armies for help to carry essential civil goods will be correspondingly reduced. It must be some time, however, before this improvement can be felt. 5. Copies of this despatch have been sent to the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East, to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad, to the Government of India and to the Department of Overseas Trade.

Considerable progress was made in collection work in those areas principally concerned in providing the balance of the 50,000 tons of grain which Tehran reouires from the Southern zone and by the end of the month some 10,000 tons was reported to be available in the Formans! hi, Hama dan and Sultan-- abad areas for transport to Tehran. The surplus from Sultanabad and neighbouring districts began to be moved”to Tehran by rail- oa’ing, ao’-'ever, to a partial breakdown of Persian Government roao trensport, as a result oi the loss of a large number of con i' r-cted trucks,, there appeared to be no prospect of transporting to P hr an the surplus of the ! am a dan and Kerman shah areas until arrangements re a do towards the end of the month for Persian Army trucks to carry up ; o 8,000 tons from Ramadan to Sultanabad or onward transport by rail and for British Army trucks to lift ' 0,0CC 'go ns in two lontbs • i ^m Kerman shah - 4,000 tons to Sultan- uoad i or or?/ ’ard tra . v ail and 5,000 tons direct to Tehran (ac .or’ding to the present arrange oents). 4. f n ■ '6 r’ e availbhility of the 4-0,000 tons surnlus required Tehran from the northern rone is still entirely 'problematical H-rsian Prime Minister was successful in obtaining the agree ment of the Soviet authorities to provide facilities/includino- rail fee : lities, on the '' or J -- n ^ ^ tern and Forth 'lestern lines ro;3 ^ transport from Tabriz to the railhead at Fianeh, for ^■.e movement to f c nr an of 18,000 tons of grain from Azerbaijan, PpDOO^tons from 'injan, 10,000 tons from -urgan and 10,000 tons ro n j.-.horrassan.

There was considerable agitation in the Tehran 'orese earl; in the month over the alle ad bad quality and faulty .distribution of the bread in Tehran. It seems m#re t’ an likely that this agitation was engineered by those sect ions of fue public who were opposed to Or.Ilillspaugh ’ s complete monopoly of the purchase and distribution of grain and wished co purchase and bring into Tehran supplies of wheat and flour on their own account. In spite of its artificial origin,, how ever, the agitation was su fficie-tly powerful to wring from Dr.rillsp-u ;h some important concessions. Authority was given to those' landowners who had fulfilled their undertakings to hand in any surplus grain at the local collecting centre and to draw an equivalent (within rati.oh limits) from tine Tehran silo* the arr . ,g- jehts for bread distribution in Tehran were taken out of the hands of the ‘ meric an director of tlie Cereals and f.read lection and placed in those of a Persian Pirector i , orking under the supervision of a 0# ; imission* and, most serious of all, Dr.Millspaugh has been Compell.ed to give his consent in principle to the issuing of permits for private individuals to purchase grain themselves - in theory within ration limits - and to move it into Tehran. This latter con cession was only made when it no longer appeared possible to secure the deputies' consent to further credits for grain pur chases without it. If implemented it may have a disasterous effect on the further collection of undertakings in the dis tricts .around Tehran, since private buyers will inevitably -ay more, than the Government price, whilst the black market thus created could not fail to attract considerable quantities of grain from the more distant districts and thus prejudice Government collection yj- Iv in tfose areas as well. liven at best, such a step would probably make it very difficult to obtain the additional surplus grain, over and above under takings, which it .was hoped to so cube ' -• the Tehran area by leans of che sugar barter scheme, which has been working very success fu11y in Khunis t an. 8.

WHKA.T SUPilRVialUK SCHEME ^ September, 1943 . SI v 1. Colonel Speaks arrived from the United States of America towards the end of the month to take over the Cereals and Bread Section from Mr. Crawford, hut unfortunately had to leave again for the United States of America almost immediately owing to ill health. • 2. In view of the unsatisfactory progress in grain collection during August, His Majesty*s Legation obtained from the A.O.C. Iraq the loan of an aircraft which has enabled Colonel Ataullah I.M.S., of the Cereals and Bread Section and Major McDowell, Middle East Supply Centre Transport Officer to make rapid tours of the more important areas. So far, Isfahan, Shiraz, Sultanabad, Hamadan and Kermanshah have been visited and the scheme has proved a considerable success. Two more tours should cover the whole country with the exception of the northern areas. At Shiraz grave abuses of transport were discovered and as a result the Cereals and • Bread Section representatives-throughout the country have' been placed in immediate charge of the allocation of lorries. The Road Transport Board representatives who until recently were able to permit transport to be used for private purposes and plead shortage of lorries when vehicles were required, are now only responsible on the technical side. Nevertheless, the local transport situation in some areas is still causing anxiety though every effort is being made to set matters right. 3. According to Cereals and Bread Section figures on 4th October, landlord’s undertakings plus forv/ard contracts amounted to over 233,000 tons out of a target figure.of 300.000 tons estimated by Mr. Sheridan to be sufficient to feed the towns and leave a small reserve to start the next year. Of this, some 72,000 tons are actually in Government stores. Collection work has not so far been hampered through lack of funds. 4. Khuzistan has done well in collecting approximately 12.000 tons out of the 14,,000 tons represented by undertakings. Now that a large proportion of the undertakings is in, the experiment of buying up cultivators’ surplus grain by barter (90^o of the Government price in cash plus 10&gt;o in sugar at* the Government rate) is being tried. The lessons learnt in this province should be of value elsewhere as soon as the majority of undertakings have been fulfilled in each place. In Sultanabad, where Mr. Bourne is Consular Liaison Officer, flour has recently been on sale from Government store against bread coupons with excellent results. The black market price of flour has fallen to little more than the controlled price, while daily issues of flour to bakers has been reduced by several tons a day. 5. In the Tehran district undertakings totalling 24,000 tons have been obtained of which over half is now under Government control in collecting centres and in the Silo. In spite of this, however, stocks of wheat in the Silo steadily diminished till at one time towards the end of September only 1^450 tons of wheat and 5,000 tons of adulterants remained. This was due partly to the fact that for some time deliveries to the Silo fell short of the City’s consumption by an average of about 50 tons per day and partly to the fact that the Government/ jT 4 *' . r , -«f* 1 (j I Q4 3Government were reluctant to introduce adulteration on any considerable scale during the Ramazan fast. Recently however, the position has improved in both respects - deliveries at the Silo now exceed consumption while at the same time adulteration with barley up to approximately «30&gt;o is. reported. The result is that wheat stocks in the Silo have risen to over 2,000 tons in a few (jays. 6. Meanwhile it became evident to His Majesty’s Legation that even if local grain collections were satisfactorily carried out throughout the country, sufficient transport was not available at the disposal of the Transport Department to ensure that grain reached the Tehran Silo from the more distant surplus areas before grain collected from the Tehran area had been consumed. The attention of Dr. Millspaugh was drawn to this fact and measures are now being taken to improve the transport situation. It is understood that these will take the form of increased .rates for contracted lorries, special registration-of all lorries in the country (without which they will not be entitled to obtain petrol) 'more stringent regulations for the control of contracted lorries and an appeal to the three Allied military forces for cooperation in control and the loan of personnel experienced in transport work. 7. During September Dr. Millspaugh held the Conference on food supplies which had been postponed on account of his illness. In‘addition to a number of foreign members of the Iranian Government, His Majesty’s Minister and the American Minister were also present. In particular it was decided that the prime Minister should be requested to approach the Soviet authorities with a view to obtaining their cooperation and all facilities for the collection and transport to Tehran of 50,000 tons oi wheat without Which Tehran cannot be fed till next harvest. An Aide-Memoire setting out the whole collection programme was prepared for the Prime Minister who has since had a preliminary conversatipn with the Soviet authorities. It is proposed that His Majesty's Minister and the American Minister should approach the new Soviet Ambassador in a similar sense as soon as he arrives in iehrpn. 8. The provisions of Regulation 16 which provides fpr the purchase by the public of flour from Government stocks against bread coupons, are for the present in abeyance ia Tehran pending a fresh census and the issue of new coupons. It was found on examination that the number of coupons in existence exceeded the population of Tehran by some 300,000. &lt; x ...... o ... CT 9. There has been no alteration in Consular Liaison Officer' personnel during the month, except that Captain Thomas, one of the two officers borrowed from -the Syrian grain purchasing scheme has been given charge of collection work in the Tehran ' area, where he is already doing useful work, particularly good progress is reported from Kerman and Kermanshah. In .the latter area 7,000 tons has been collected against total undertakings of 14,7OO'*'tons and Mr. Shipton reports that an average of 180 tons is bding brought into Kermanshah town daily. In the Kerman area purchases have reached a total of 4,000 tons, ol which 1,200 tons have already arrived in Kerman; transport, however, is causing anxiety and Captain Hassan reports that some districts have alleged that their ambers are so full that they cannot accept further deliveries. 10. The outlook in Isfahan, always a difficult area, has improvedconsiderably and Lieutenant Joel reports total deliveries mounting to 6,716 tons of which 4,757 tons is still in stock. 11. Lieutenant Simmons, Consular Liaison Officer Hamadan, came to Tehran to report early in the month and discussed with Mr. Crawford a programme for deliveries to Tehran from the surplus of his area, estimated at 10,000 tons.

Russians would allow 12,000 tons of rice to be exported to iehran. 5. Another concession which the Russians want in return for allowing Tehran to receive .grain from their zone is the completion of the ^inian-mxaneh section of the railway at an estimated oost of 40 , 000,000 rids. 4.

Towards the end of August it was calculated that ' c-rain* from Allied sources in the Tehran Silo would davs ? requirements) actually delivered at 'the Silo* His Majesty’s Legation called the attention of Dr. Millspaugh and the Administrator-Oeneral of the Cereals &amp; Bread' Section to the fact that a serious situation would arise in October if local collections were not expedited. It was suggested that uhless approximately 10,000 tons of local grain could he accumulated during September, the food sunply^of Tehran would be in a precarious state from the moment that Allied grain was exhausted. Energetic measures we ,o e taken to co-ordinate transnort and it was reported at the end of August that over 100 tons of grain a day was being delivered at the Silo. This, however, is^only half the daily requirements and the Cereals &amp; Bread Section are now making every effort to raise daily receipts as quickly as possible to &lt;bover 200 tons a day to put an end to the steep fall in the Silo stocks and then gradually to build up a reserve. They report that over 2,000 tons have been collected in out lying G-overnment stores and that undertakings from landlords in the Tehran district amount to 20,000 tons. Dr.Millspaugh has arranged a conference of officials of the Cereals &amp; Trans port Sections at which His Majesty’s Legation and MESC. will also be represented, to discuss the general situation, ways and means of improving the collection and transport of grain &gt; and the action to be taken against recalcitrant landlords as soon as evidence is available. 2, Sufficient supplementary information from Consulates and CIO’s to be of value in estimating the general collection position has not been received since the last report was writ ten, but the Cereals &lt;g Bread Section state officially that landlords’ undertakings plus contracts amount in all to over '171,000 tons and that 37,000 tons have actually been delivered so far. Landlords’ undertakings are still being obtained. 3. it now appears that the revolving fund of Rials 500 millions asked for by Mr.Sheri dan and approved by Dr.Millspaugh will not suffice to purchase all the grain required. The main reason for this is that owing to the separation of the Price Stabilisation Section from the Cereals &amp; Bread Section, re venue from the sale of monopoly goods such as sugar, tea and piece-goods will not now accrue to the Cereals administration. The case for more funds for the Cereals &amp; Bread Section is being put to Dr.Millspaugh. Meanwhile, judging from Consular and CLO. reports, in recent weeks collections in general have not been seriously.hampered by lack of funds.Ill - -2 4. The transport situation from the point of view of the number of lorries in the country which are available for grain collection is not unsatisfactory. On the other hand, requirements of individual areas have ni&gt;t in all cases been met, while misuse of.transport by drivers and corrupt local officials is causing anxiety. It is in cal ling attention to and so far as possible, mitigating this state of affairs, that the British supervisory organisation is doing most valuable work at the present stage. For ox- ample- on one CIO. reporting that only 25 lorries were work ing on grain collection in his area, it was discovered that 65 lorries had actually been despatched there by the Road Transport Board. The whereabouts of the missing 40 lorries, presumably engaged in illicit transport work, are now being investigated, A proposal is under consideration to send Lt.-Col. Ataullah, from the Cereals &amp; Bread Section and Major MacDowall, MBSC.Transport Officer, on a rapid tour of the more important areas to expedite collections and to check and co-ordinate transport. 5. Mr. Crawford has succeeded Mr.Sheridan temporarily as Administrator-General of the Cereals &amp; Bread Section, pending the arrival of an American official who is expected shortly from the United States of America. 6. There has been no alteration in CIO. personnel during the month, beyond the transfer of Mr.Joel from MESC. and his posting to Isfahan as assistant to Col.Robert. The work of CIO’s in obtaining undertakings and contracts, in co-ordinating transport and in providing the Cereals &amp; Bread Section, through H.M.Legation, with accurate information re garding collections, transport, finances and local officials has been of the greatest value. Mr.Sheri dan, before his de parture, acknowledged on various occasions, - including a special letter to His Majesty’s Minister, - his deep indebt edness to the whole British supervising organisation for the help they had given him during his eleven months of office.

Sir, Tehran, 1th August, 1943. ^ IN view of the fact that not only the Persian Government and all classes o, of Persians but even to some extent the American Food Adviser and the United States Legation have been inclined to lay on His Majesty’s Government the ) blame for the hardships which the country has undergone during the past year owing to the inadequate bread supply, it is, I think, desirable to place on record some account of the difficulties which we had to face and of the efforts that we made to assist and advise the Persian Government in the matter of grain collec tion in 1942-43. 2. The question how best to control the 1942 harvest first began to engage my serious attention in April of that year when, owing to the failure of tne late rains, the crop prospects in some parts of the country were unfavourable and the Government, without making any serious attempt to assess the real position, were calling on the Allies to supply them with large quantities of wheat from abroad. Official corruption and the evil reputation of the Food Depart- men made all classes unwilling to deliver their surplus grain to the Government, while political insecurity led to hoarding, and the high price offered for grain in Turkey and Iraq encouraged smuggling to these countries on a considerable scale. 3. On the 7th May I addressed a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to fix at once a more reasonable price for wheat from the coming harvest than the rate of £8 a ton then in force, and also to put in hand immediately any irrigation projects which would enable increased sowings to take place in the autumn. His reply, however, was couched in vague and pessimistic terms, contemplating a shortage of grain as inevitable and suggesting that the deficit 1 should be made up by imports from the United States or India. The Persian Government were repeatedly warned that they must take adequate steps to set their own house in order before they could expect His Majesty’s Government to assist them with imports from abroad, but it was not until July that, under continued pressure from us and, as it turned out, too late to influence appreciably the attitude of landowners, new prices were fixed, varying according to the region from £9 to £13 per ton. The Persian Government also made some attempt to promulgate, under the Anti-Hoarding Law of March 1942, reasonable regula tions designed to ensure the collection of the landlords’ surplus and some improvement in the situation seemed possible. The intention of M. Bader, then Minister of Finance, was at that time to collect as much of the proprietors’ surplus as possible in the shortest possible time and then to purchase the balance in the open market, the peasants being encouraged to sell their surplus by the offer of piece-goods in exchange. 4. It was realised that the raising of the price for the landlords’ surplus would not by itself be sufficient to secure adequate supplies, and that the more formidable obstacle of official corruption had still to be surmounted. With this in mind it was proposed to the Minister of Finance in May that British officials should be appointed in the various wheat-growing areas mainly for the purpose of securing an independent estimate of the position in each area : they would be able to check the reliability of claims for assistance and would also exercise some check on the activities of the provincial revenue officers, so that both landowners and the Government might receive fair treatment and the delivery of grain be encouraged. The proposals were accepted and five officers, known as “ Consular Liaison Officers,” were duly appointed. 5. In August the Soheily Government was replaced by that of Qawam-es- Saltaneh, who first endeavoured to solve the wheat problem by demanding 120,000 tons from the Allies. This demand was, of course, rejected, there being no reason to suppose that sufficieTTt supplies would not be available from the country for the greater part if not the whole of the year. In many areas, such as Azerbaijan and Isfahan, the crops were, in fact, well above the average, [ 45^—25 ] ,. ^ »■! 17026 ! ■ * 1while in Khorassan they bad never been better, and a rough estimate by our consul-general in Meshed gave the surplus for that province as over 40,000 tons. In other regions, notably Gurgan and in some parts of the Hamadan district, the areas sown with wheat were more extensive than they had been for many years. 6. The complete unreality of the Persian Government’s attitude in asking for supplies from abroad while the harvest was still on the threshing floor demonstrated the bankruptcy of the central food administration. In suG»* circumstances the raising of wheat prices, the enactment of anti-hoarding laws, and the appointment of our consular liaison officers could have little effect. As early as mid-February 1942 I had. indeed, suggested to the Persian Government that, in addition to financial advisers, they should engage in America some experienced persons, e.q., from the staff which carried out relief work with Mr. Hoover in Belgium, to assist the Government in the distribution of monopolised supplies such as wheat and sugar. It was not, however, till the end of September that one American adviser was appointed to work in the Ministry of Supply, and he, unfortunately, was not well chosen. Though probably a slick buyer and seller in ordinary conditions, Mr. Sheridan had, in fact, no qualifica tions for a post requiring good judgment and organising ability, and he was to prove quite unequal to the task of framing the efficient central food policy on which so much depended. 7. Instead of concentrating immediately on the practical solution of particular problems of grain collection area by area, Mr. Sheridan had recourse to general economic theory for what he imagined was the simple remedy for a situation already rapidly deteriorating. Rejecting the opinion unanimously* expressed at a conference held on the 5th October in this legation by all those with any experience of local conditions who were present, that no further change in the official price should be made at this late stage, Mr. Sheridan accepted the advice tendered by Mr. Kahn, who happened to be in Tehran on a visit, that a clean sweep should be made of the whole of the Government’s policy and that a so-called world price should be fixed for all wheat transactions throughout the country. It was generally felt that yet another change in the official Govern ment price would have the worst possible psychological effect as indicating anxiety on the part of the Government as to the future and therefore aggravating J the very lack of confidence it was designed to allay. In my telegram No. 139 of the 12th October and again in a note given by Mr. Squire to Mr. Casey personally on the 17th October, the opinion was expressed that this policy would be disastrous and, in spite of the fact that we continued to give every assistance to Mr. Sheridan in all his activities, this forecast has proved, I consider, to have been accurate. 8. By the new policy the Government price of wheat was raised to £24 a ton (£28 in Tehran and the districts along the northern frontier) but no effective measures to put an end to the black market were taken, nor, indeed, was the Administration strong enough to enforce any such measures even had it wished to do so. The result, as had been foreseen, was an immediate doubling of the black market price of £30 a ton, and the price, in fact, reached £150 in some districts before the close of the season. Other prices rose in sympathy and a tremendous impetus was given to the inflationary movement. Almost more serious was a result which had not been foreseen. The Government, which by purchasing wheat at £13 a ton and selling bread at 2 rials a kilog, was able to cover its total costs and even earn a small profit in some districts, had intended to maintain the price of bread at its previous level and to bear the heavy loss which the new prices entailed. When, however, the black market price rose to £60 a ton or more, peasants, who had before been content to eat their own wheat, now sold their own stocks at an enormous profit and flocked into the towns to live on cheap Government bread. This not only increased enormously the demand for Government supplies of wheat but caused bread riots in many of the towns, especially Kermanshah and the west generally. Moreover, the loss on the sale of bread was so great as to add considerably to the budget deficit and aggravate the tendency to inflation. 9. Even so, the new price might well have succeeded, at least for a time, in attracting larger quantities of grain to the Government granaries had the announcement been accompanied by prompt and well-conceived action by the department (later Ministry) of Supply. In the first place, the announcement was made in the press and over the wireless without any previous intimation to the local authorities or any provision for the extra funds required. In con sequence, early offers to deliver at the new price were, for several weeks, rejected3 for want of instructions and Lack of funds. When orders were at last received they were nicely calculated to defeat their own object. The new price was not to be paid to those who had not delivered their undertakings in full for the last two years. This was generally interpreted, and with very good reason, as mean ing that the Minister of Supply, who was responsible for the issue of this order, was determined to sabotage the work of the American adviser. There were, in J^?t, three “ kings ’’ in this remarkable “ imperium,’' the third being the Under- Wcretary, Mr. Assadi, well-meaning and honest, but inexperienced, and subject to continuous attacks by Deputies and other unscrupulous individuals with axes to grind. The resulting spate of contradictory orders only added to the general confusion, which was made worse by the fact that those of Mr. Sheridan, who, as adviser, had no executive authority, were, in fact, ultra vires. 10. There was yet another factor which of itself effectively nullified all efforts to put the new policy into force and which passed almost unnoticed at the time. Certain towns such as Yazd. Qum and Kashan have always been allowed to purchase their requirements in the open market, and no attempt was made to introduce other arrangements to meet the altered conditions. As a result, agents for these places continued to purchase their requirements unhindered in the black market, thus effectively sabotaging the whole scheme. 11. The situation might not have been so bad if Mr. Sheridan had been prepared to listen to the advice offered by this Legation. A few out of many instances of his failure to do so are recorded below : — On his first arrival he was advised that without American assistants in the provinces he could not hope to accomplish his mission, and in the meantime the whole of. the consular liaison officers organisation was offered to him to be entirely at his disposal. Neither suggestion was adopted, and it was not until many weeks had passed that Mr. Sheridan realised that his hopes of adequate assistance from young Persians were illusory, and took steps to apply to the I nited States for the engagement of a number of assistants. It took him still longer to adopt the suggestion that our consular liaison officers should be given a certain amount of authority of an advisory if not of an executive nature, and even then he only invited their assistance in a half-hearted and unmethodical manner, leaving his own officials manv opportunities for neglecting their advice and avoiding action which local situations continually demanded. There is good reason to believe that Mr. Sheridan repented, too late, of his failure to make use of the consular liaison officers, and he has been heard to declare, in the presence of British and American hearers, that but for the consular liaison officers such quantities of wheat as were collected would never have been got in. In the Hamadan and Kermanshah districts there were large stocks of grain in areas away from the main roads and liable to be snowed up during the winter months. Repeated requests to move these stocks while the roads were still open were disregarded. We begged that local officials should be given authority to hire transport for the purpose, but the Central Government were unwilling either themselves to sanction adequate rates of hire or to allow local authorities to do so. As a result some 3.000 tons of wheat were snowed up in these areas which consular liaison officers were at last, when it was too late, given full authority to move by animal transport, at no matter what cost. In the Kerman area it had long been realised that assistance would lie needed before the next harvest. As early as September it was suggested by us that a certain reputable agent should be appointed to buy at the Government price in Sistan enough of the large surplus in that area to make good the needs of Kerman. It was not. however, until January, when Kerman stocks were at the point of exhaustion that after numerous urgent representations and weeks of negotia tions, the suggested contract was at last given. The contractor was so successful that Mr. Sheridan has engaged him as sole contractor for the purchase of a veiy laro’e quantity of wheat in Sistan out of the 1943-44 crop. . Repeated efforts to persuade the Government to take action against hoarders have similarly proved almost entirely abortive. In Khuzistan five small hoards were discovered in July, two of them belonging to a deputy named Nassen, but all efforts to persuade the Government to take any action whatever against him were unavailing. Another recalcitrant landlord in the same province was the Ruis- ut-Tujjar° After repeated expostulations on our part the Government did eventually deport this individual to Tehran, but they have been unable since to bring themselves to take any steps against him, and he has since returned to Khuzistan. Yet a third hoarder against whom we repeatedly urged action is [45—25] B 2I given by Mr. Baluki was, romise which, vere issued by a ter when our . m ' to the Prime :imum use of motor trans camels from rgency of the The result lIso urged on contract was the contract diverted for mient under by the Boad officials had posal except ie most part the difficult Adiich grain hey did not )f funds for lly made to local motor that three ' in each of nd control. &gt;ort Boai'd, 3w to feed mulate the e task and ck market. • For this the failure ion of the ^ of 10.000 of Persia, ices in the tab Last ddition to hange for assist in ffiaijan to situation ),000 tons troops in ved from 1 officials, 'f sundry irt of the J of their s virtual tarvation s the end ifficulties Majesty’s ^ might be expected that the experiences of the past year would have been sufficient to induce Mr. Sheridan to take all possible steps to ensure that the bumper harvest now in view should not go the way of its predecessor, but, as I have already reported separately, the preliminary arrangements made by the Persian Government have been far from satisfactory and give no ground for optimism in spite of the good harvest now being reaped in many parts of the country. Mr. Sheridan, at a recent conference at which Dr. Millspaugh and ^representatives of this legation, the United States Legation and Middle East Supply Centre were present, showed few signs of administrative ability. He was uncertain of the total quantity of grain he proposed to collect and was unable, therefore, to inform Dr. Millspaugh of the exact sum he would require to finance his grain purchases. He has not yet, in spite of frequent reminders, made out a transport programme on which lorries can be allotted for collection work, and at the close of the conference he revealed the fact that he had hardly any sacks in which to collect grain. Fortunately, other people had had greater foresight, and Middle East Supply Centre have been able to show that the quantities of sacks which are in the country or will arrive by the time they are needed are adequate. 17. Mr. Sheridan recently tendered his resignation to the Persian Govern ment, with effect from early September, on the plea of private affairs. Since then the Ministry of Supply has been abolished, and the collection of grain has been entrusted to a new Cereals and Bread Section, with its own director-general, which is to work under the direct control of Dr. Millspaugh. Dr. Millspaugh is making strenuous efforts to secure some able and experienced American to direct this department, and it is hoped that a suitable man will arrive soon. Meanwhile, however, what with the inevitable disorganisation which has followed the dissolution of the Ministry of Supply, the weakness of the Central Government in all matters, the greed and influence of vested interests, the unremitting efforts of the Persians who broadcast from Berlin to persuade their fellow-countrymen in this country to hide their grain lest it be stolen by the Allies, the disorders in or near some of the chief wheat areas in Ears and Isfahan, and the failure of Mr. Sheridan to make adequate arrangements in time, it is possible that, in spite of the bumper harvest this year, the Government will have difficulty in feeding some of the deficit areas. 18. This despatch may appear to contain an unduly large proportion of criticism of Mr. Sheridan. Mr. Sheridan has some qualities which have been of use; he is always optimistic and good-humoured, and in the worst days of winter, when the town was often almost without bread, he worked on without losing his head, scraping up small quantities of any kind of grain or other food-stuff that could be made into some sort of loaf. Also it must be remembered that he has not always been supported by the Minister of Supply. Moreover, his policy of erecting a central Government bakery in each of the large towns, although it has been sabotaged completely by the bakers in some towns and partially in Tehran, will have to be adopted eventually unless the Persian population is to continue to be exploited as in the past by what is perhaps the most corrupt and heartless class in a heartless and corrupt race—the bakers. In spite of all this, however, Mr. Sheridan must be adjudged a failure. The United * States Government seems to have taken great trouble to select able men for the other advisory posts in Persia, but for the one most in evidence to the man in the stree t—the Department of Supply—they chose a commission agent without any experience of organisation on a large scale. His failure is particularly regrettable because it tends to discredit foreign advisers m general. The corrupt fear the foreign advisers, the vain think them unnecessary. With Mr. Sheridan the vain have^ood evidence of the superfluity of foreign advice: while owing to his hasty and spasmodic policy the corrupt have had nothing to feai. Throughout this difficult time His Majesty s Legation have been fortunate in receiving prompt assistance from His Majesty s Government, trom the Govern ment of India and from the Minister of State; and in having as a check on inefficiency and corruption an able group of consular liaison officers, guided by the experience, the wisdom and the imperturbable resolution of Mi. Squire. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister of State, to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s representatives at Washington and Moscow. , D I have, Ac. R.

Regulation No.16, which allows landowners living in towns to acquire limited quantities of wheat or flour for the consumption of their families, and which allows cereals to be transported between villages Without licence, marks a concession made following an active campaign of pro tests against Regulations Nos.14 and 15. The annual amount of flour which may be 'obtained by landowners or householders under the new Regulation exceeds by about 40/, the amount ob tainable under the bread rationing scheme hitherto in force; it is believed that this increase was unintentional and is likely to lead to a considerable drain on Oovernment stocks in proportion to the number of people whl avail themselves of the concession. It is thought, however, that Dr.Millspaugh will limit issues for the present to about one month’s supply at a time and see how the grain collection programme succeeds. If the anticipated amount of grain is not collected during the next two or three months, it will be necessary to reduce the flour ration. To do so now might destroy confidence and increase the tendency to hoard. Yours ever, V/. A. B. ILIFF. \ Financial Counsellor.1 tea A PPP E IT D I X E. MIT ESP AUG-H SPECIAL PO^/SPS LA'7.

COPY 16th September, Dear Mathias, The Government of India have, in their telegram No.7773 of 14th September (copy of which I enclose), raised again the subject of allocation of Indian tea in the Middle East. They appreciate the size of the total -^allocations to the Persian Gulf countries but they regret cVv. omission of countries such as Egypt, Turkey and the Su .n which had regular markets for Indian tea for a number of years and they fear lest the discontinuance of supply at the present time may injure future trade with them. They ask for consideration of the question of some provision to be made for tea to be supplied from India to these countries. We should be’glad to have your comments on this request. You will recollect that when the Tea purchase Scheme was first started it was decided that Middle East countries in the Red Sea area should draw their supplies from East Africa, while the Persian Gulf should look to India for supply. Such a division was obviously reasonable on supply and shipping grounds and in our telegram No.16592 of 22nd September, 1942 we reported accordingly to the Government of India. The latter made no comment on the proposal and indeed the position was so easily defensible that it would have been difficult for them to attack it. Today, however, the position is somewhat different as, according to the latest allocation statement, the Red Sea territories are drawing their supplies, not from East Africa, but from Ceylon. Consequently the shipping reason for India not supplying these territories goes by the board. I can find nothing in our papers to show why Ceylon was substituted for East Africa and I should «T.Ii• Mathias, Esq. , Ministry of Pood, portman Court, portman Square, W.l. be/...be glad if you would enlighten me. The reason, doubtless, why India was not allocated a share in this trade lay in the fact that she had objected to the U.K.C.C. being employed by the M.E.S.C. as purchasing and distributing agents for territories supplied with Indian tea. Will you be good enough to confirm this. If you have any further comments on the Government of India’s request or suggestions for replying to Sfcrh should welcome them. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

Some 28,000 cases of tea bought by Persian and Indian importers have been lying at Nokkundi since July last year. This tea is stored in the open and is probably deteriorating rapidly. It has been paid for by importers who have also incurred considerable charges for bank interest, storage, insurance, etc. Though export licensed by Government of India its transport into Persia was originally delayed by damage to the railway and subsequently by new arrangements for centralisation of tea purchases^ 3. Requests for release of tea have been frequently made by the Persian Government as well as by merchants concerned of whom a large proportion are British Indian subjects, and its release was recommended by Combined Supplies Committee in March and on various occasions since. The latest communications received here on the subject were copies of teleg rams N n . 377-8 May 14th from Government of India“Tolhe India Office and of reply No. 1231 June Uhj^ purport of which was to maintain reiusal to release the tea. 4. The reasons given for the refusal may be sound from the Indian or Ministry of Pood point of view, but they to take into account the Persian point of view that the tea was bought and paid for in the ordinary course of legitimate trade and that considerable financial loss has already been caused by its retention. The Persian Government have agreed to take over such part of the tea as is not already ruined by exposure. The release of this tea within the agreed quota for Persia would create a good impression in the Government and trading circles here and as such opportunities seldom present themselves, I strongly recommen the question be now given further and favourable consideration.

In my telegram No.622 I also suggested that owing to the rapidly growing capacity or the roads and railways it should be possible for this increase to be made without at the same time increasing, at the expense of supplies to Russia, the percentage of the total tonnage carried which is devoted to civil supplies^ 'Ufo#' 4t&amp; : 2e The figures given for civil imports during the past four months in your telegrams 25g f 288 and 54o to the Minister of State show that while we have effected a slight increase in the tonnage imported each month ? the percentage of the total goods cleared through Persian — part's which is devoted to civil supplies has consistently decreased. This steady decline in the percentage of space devoted to civil supplies is disappointing. I realise that we needto keep in step with Millspaugh over these supply questions bum we have made no move without consulting him and are still waiting for the result of his enquiries about the- goods held up at the ports (your telegram 678) . 3. In these circumstances it would be useful to know whether Millspaugh still v/ishes us to increase the volume of civil imports. If he does I should be grateful for your suggestions a&lt;.s to how this may bost be effected.

Unless we are prepared to face demands for grain from overseas we cannot remain indifferent. I therefore propose where we are satisfied from reports from His Majesty’s Consular Officers or other reliable British sources that a given land-owner is endangering food supply in his area by withholding wheat and/or inducing others to do so, we should require him to leave the area if it is one where we have troops or ask the Government to remove him if we have no troops there. In bad cases we should be justified in regarding him as sabotaging the war effort by trying to create famine conditions end in asking the Government to hand him over at Sultanabad for internment and interrogation. Whether we should ourselves effect the arrest if Persian Government did not co-operate would depend largely on decision to be taken in regard to participants in pro-Axis plot but it is quite certain that a few such arrests would have a most salutary effect as was the case in Syria. 3. Proposal made during last harvest that certain notorious hoarders of Kermanshah should be interned at Sultanabad was rejected because security authorities had no staff to take on the extra work-. As enquiry and detection would be done by Consular Officers or Consular liaison officers as a rule, extra work should not be serious and I trust security authorities will be able to withdraw the objection they raised last year.

[Copies sent to Mr.Armstrong]. str. c ^ ^ ^ f7*r ) t2/~&gt;The Government of India* s telegram llOokl^Ok- of June 4th is a laudable attempt to mal® constructive suggestions for the improvement of the situation in Persia. The important part a this telegram is paragraph 3&gt; which puts forward the suggestion that the distribution in Persia of imported piecegoods, tea and sugar might be controlled so as to link it up with the collectior of wheat. The Government of India explained that the exchange of these goods for wheat would not necessarily be on a direct barter basis, but would require supervision by the Consular Liaison Officer organisation, probably strengthened by a body of officers to accompany the conveys of commodities for sale on the spot in return for wheat brought into the local Government store. The Government cf India added, however, that it was unlikely that they would be able to lend ary additional officers from India for this purpose. 2. The Government of India* s telegram was repeated to H.'i.Minister at Tehran and the Minister of State. In his telegram No.246 of June l6th, which was addressed to the Government of India, Sir R.Bullard, after expressing agreement in principle with the suggestion described above, commented that its adoption (a) might cut across the plans for the distribution of consumer goods new being worked out by Dr.Millspaugh, the U.S.Financial Adviser; (b) would require the employment of far more British or American staff than could be obtained. Sir R. Bullard concluded, however, that when it hau been found possible to estimate what additional supplies of consumer goods we relate ded in Persia, aiy help which India could give in supplying them would be greatly appreciated; and he undertook to see that India herself got credit in Persian eyes for her help. 3 ./3* The Llinister of State has not yet cornmented on the Govemr.ient of India 1 s proposal, though a request for the views of the Middle dast Supply Centre was addressed to them hy the Ministry of V7ar Transport on June 8th. It is probable that Cairo is waiting until the M.J.S.C.Delegation which recently visited India has returned home and has reported. V The matter 7/as discussed at a meeting on June 22nd, attended by representatives of the Foreign Office, the Ministries of War Transport and Food, the U.K.C.C., and this Office (External and E.&amp; 0. Departments;. The Foreign Office took the line that there v/as substance in Sir R.Bullard’s objections to the full implementation of the Government of India* s proposal. On the other band they thought that the increased supply of consumer goods to Persia would be desirable in itself, as tending to absorb surplus currency, bring down prices and. thus generally counteract inflation. Vfhile they agreed that ary additional supplies of goods should if possible be used in connection with some scheme for exCbaC^ng v/heat, they went so far as to say tla£importation of such goods was bound to have a beneficial effect upon the Persian economy, even if they were to get into the Black Market. 5 • On the question of what goods could he made available for the purpose in view, it 7vas stated that piecegoods were in very short supply, ’while the obstacle to the supply of a large quantity of sugar was the difficulty of shipping it from Mauritius. Cn the other hand it was pointed out that ample supplies of tea are available in India; and it was suggested that Persia should he offered vp to 90 per cent of their estimated normal import requirements, viz: 15.2 million lbs, to be purchased in India by the Persian Government’s Tea Biyer under the Ministry of Food scheme. It was conceded that the transport of this quantity of tea (not a bulky commodity in relation to its value) from India to Persia should not present insuperable difficulties. There is a choice of three means of transport, viz: rail, via Hokkundi, steamer to the head of the Gulf, or dhow to Gulf ports. The disadvantage of the second of these methods is that the land routes from tbs/the liead of the Gulf northwards are already congested; tljL. disadvantage of the third is that dhow traffic is uncontrolled, so that supplies hy this means almost inevitably i^ass into the Black Liarket. Office telegram to Tehran No421 of June 26th. Although this telegram specifically refers to the Gove mire nt of India* s telegram No*4404 and has been repeated to them, it seems desirable that the Secretary of State should send them a brief reply on his own account. Bor this purpose a draft telegram is submitted, in which the Forefen Office and the E. &amp; 0. Department have concurred. Paragraph 2 of the draft males an appreciative reference to the Government of India* s offer in paragraph 5 of their telegram to bear in mind the possibility of making further seed grain available for the agricultural scheme in Khuzistan run by Colonel Noel. 6.

Government of India [of - 4 th and 16th June: proposGl~to~suppIy tea, sugar and piece goods to Persia in exchange for wheat]. The Government of India's proposal to extract wheat in return for controlled distribution of essential commodities such as piece goods, tea and sugar has been sympathetically considered by Departments concerned in the light of your comments. 2. The main problems appear to be the serious shortage of piece goods and shipping difficulties in the way of increasing the supply of sugar, as well as the impossibility of finding the large number of British or American personnel who would be required to exercise efficient supervision over distribution. In view of these limitations we suggest the following as a basis for further progress. 3. Tea can be supplied from India up to 90$ of Persia's estimated normal import requirements. Quantity available is 15.2 million lbs., giving an additional allocation of 8.5 million lbs. over and above present allocation of 6.72 million lbs. for 1943 / 4 . In view of impossibility of increasing supplies of consumer goods otter than tea, we recommend that advantage should be taken of this offer, and that arrangements should be put in hand at once. Even if this quantity of tea cannot be used directly in connexion with scheme for extracting wheat it should have good effect in combating infiation and bringing down prices. If you agree, please discuss with Middle East Supply Centre representative and arrange for extra quantity of tea to be included in Persian import programme. The Persian Government's tea buyer in India (who will be responsible for purchases under Ministry of Food scheme) should be informed of decisions reached.

It is not possible to use contracted lorries for the harvest collection as private owners who have great difficulty in obtaining spare parts refuse to operate on all bad roads to collect gram* Government-owned lorries are used only and the contracted vehicles for transport of grain from tno main collecting centres. Tehran needs about 150 buses. There are now 70 at work and it will be possible to put another 40 or 50 on the roads as soon as more tyres arrive, A number of light lorries which were originally used as buses could be re-converted as a number of bus-bodies can still be found in the town. 5. Local transport company now operates 490 lease-lend trucks and about 1,000 contract vehicles but # many cpntracted vehicles drop out each month owing to mechanical failure and shortage of essential spare parts. 4 .

I agree that a scheme such as you suggest in your paragraph 3 would facilities [sic ?facilitatej the extraction of wheat. One of the chief causes of hoarding has been that a fanner who sold his wheat for cash could find little to buy with his rials. He preferred therefore to keep his wheat. The bumper harvest expected this year will however in itself tend to make wheat a less desirable hoarding commodity, and if in addition more consumer goods could be made available there would be a further inducement to agriculturalist to turn wheat into money in order to buy what he wanted. 2. Problem of enuitable distribution of consumer goods and of the elimination of corruption and savage profiteering is one of H/s chief pre-occupations and he is as alive as we are to the urgent necessity of taking action. He has plans well advanced of which the establishment of his price stabilisation section (already accomplished) and authority for engagement of nine more American experts to administer it, are just the beginnings. Arrangements for the latter however may take some time* 3. I suggest therefore that we should leave M. to work out his own plans and rely upon him to do all that is possible to remove the blemishes in the present system of distribution, which you so rightly deplore. To introduce a scheme such as you suggest might cut across M.’s plans and in any case would I fear, in view of the size of the country require the employment of far more British or American personnel, than could be obtained. 4. At the same time, when the lists of the necessary additional supplies referred to in paragraph 2 of ray immediately preceding telegram have been prepared, any help in supplying that India can give, will be much appreciated and, in view of the considerations mentioned in your paragraph 1 , we must see that India herself gets credit in Persian eyes for what she does.

We have discussed the question with him already and as a first stop, and with the 0 eject of discussing the type of goods actually held up, he has issued a regulation calling upon all owners of these goods to make an early declaration to the Customs Administration giving the essential information about each consignment. Only after this information has been collected and examined, which may take some work, should we be able in consultation with Millspaugh to put forward a programme for moving them. Meanwhile however, it would be most useful if you would take up the question with the Americans as you propose ? with the object of securing their consent in principle, v/hile^leaving details to be worked out locally by the Britisn, American ana Persian authorities concerned. I can'arrange for the necessary co-ordination. 2. As regards the third paragraph of your telegram under reference and seventh paragraph of Minister of State s telegram under reference, here again Millspaugh certainly has views. We have already asked him to^supply us with a list of those goods the importation of which would suit his plans best. He has promised to furnish this list as soon as possible, but until we know what is actually in the country but hold up at the ports (see first paragraph above; it would be wasteful and unpractical to ask for the importation of something which is perhaps already here.

The conclusion which I have reached is that there is no case for any major change of policy# It is unthinkable that we should abandon the policy of sending maximum aid to Russia and so long as-this continues we must expect unfavourable reactions in Persia, ^ Another conceivable change of policy would be .in the direction of taking over more direct control of the administration,^ and thus mitigating the hardships suffered by the Persian people as the result of the mis-government and oppression of their own incompetent, selfish and corrupt rulers; but this too must.be ruled out for'several reasons, especially because it would be directly opposed to \|British, Indian and Persian interests to take over n administrative control of one part of Persia and thereby give the Russians a lead for doing likewise in their zone. 3. Since then there seem to be no very herpic remedies open to us, I fear that we can •only take limited action which, even if successful, cannot be expected to effect any sudden or far-reaching improvement. Apart from the major problem of ’inflation there are two questions for consideration. First, &lt;can we do : anything more, within/- 2 - within the limits of our present policy, to make bertter conditions in Persia for the Persians? Secondly, ho#T&gt;an we ensure that we get some credit for what we may do to help ^ the Persians, and that v/e are not blamed for everything that goes wrong, whether due to us or not? 4. On the first point, the steady increase of the ^ capacity of the Persian supply routes should enable us , without ssitosty affecting Russian supplies, to hasten the clearance pV the 18,000 tons of Persian civil supplies which are blocked in Persian ports* On'receipt of.^tne Minister of S^bes promised observations, I propose to take this up with the . Americans at once* Similarly,.I.think that we should do whatever is possible to help distribution with lorries, tyres and snarest I am glad to see .that,the British _ authorities A concerned are already taking active steps in this connexion, (see Minister of State, s telegrams Nps.J.lSQ_.and 1191 now under consideration)s I appreciate that the Persians “ffiay'not be making effective use of such lorries as we have been able to supply* but I shall always be glad to know . whether you think anything more-snould be done on these lines, 5. As regards the second point, I hope that, on the f forthcoming arrival of Major Savidge, you will go seriously! ... into the question of intensifying- our propaganda, and I ton*, should like your views on the points, raised in paragraph o ' ’ of my telegra m No. 245 [ of March 15th]* I realise that the main difficulty is that the Persians are more frightened of the Russians that they are of us, on whom^they vent all their resentment* They see us, or the American railway troops under our general supervision, monopolising their railway* without considering that it is lor Russia that we do it/ They see us bringing Poles into their already starving country, without reflecting that that is because the Soviet Government has made their existence in Russia impossible. • They reproach us for the inadequacy of the supplies which we, at great cost, bring ! n ^to replace the shortage caused by the' Russian seizure oi foodstulls. n pressure has to be brought to bear upon the Persian Government, ihe Russians are careful to leave that to us* so that we get all the blame. For these ana other reasons, ihtensi fication of our propaganda may involve the danger oi giving some offence to the Russians, but provided that we are careful to-avoid anything in the'nature of an anti-Ru.sian ' campaign, I think that we should take tms risk., 6. Moreover, I think that we ought in future to continue and intensify our efforts to make the Russians associate themselves with us on all occasions when action has to be taken with the Persians .m th? inters^to ol Russian aid. We must not of course pume this policy to the pytent'of arciudicing the war effort*.. But the principle ifone which ie should bear in mind. Almost everything we do in Persia is to help Russia, ana if- on we .al! not act without Russian collaboration, it is the RuoSi^ns who must suffer most. * 7 Rut this does not apply to the control of the press.

The basis of these regulations is that every landlord has to make an undertJfcing ('ta'ohhud’T to sell to the Government the net surplus of wheat and barley remaining after making the following deductions from his total oropi- ( 1 ) ”Justomary local expenses 1 ’ (^mounting to a few per cent); ( 2 ) The peasant's share (varying from l/ 8 th to 2/5ths of the balance after deducting ( 1 )); (3) beed; (4) Deductions from the remainder, for landlord's expenses, on the following scale:- '■he at . (a) ill of the first two tons; (b) 20 ^ of quantities from 2 tox 50 tons; (c) 10 Jt of quantities from 50 to 100 tons; (d) 5 }t) of quantities from 100 tona upwards. .3 &gt; 50 per cent. 5. Jaoh undertaking is to be based on a ” Declaration ’ 1 signed by the landlords:, which will incorporate the results of two preliminary assessments, a first fixing the amount of seed sown and a second establishing the amount of grain harvested. These preliminary assessments, where there is still time to carry them out, may do something to make the undertakings less arbitrary than they have usually been in previous years. 4. according to .rticle 1 of the Decree, the peasant’s share of the crop is free, although an attempt has been made in .rticle 26 of the Instructions to circumvent this stipulation in oases where peasants cultivate public land and so take for themselves the whole crop. 5. I enclose a copy of a note by Mr«G*P. 8 qttire commenting on various imperfections in the regulations, a further serious defect not mentioned in his note may well prove to be the decision to allow land&lt;. lords to keep the whole of the first two tons of their net surplus, since this will exclude a host of small landowners from the scope of the regulations. 6 . One of the more satisfactory features of the regulations is the decision embodied in j?ticle 4 of the Decree to allow local Commissions to rooommend suitable prices for the frontier districts.

Thus an increase of 50'' in the prices of these im- orts meant an increase of 15N in every family’s expenditure. Government’s measures to control the economic life of the country made the situation worse and wo (a) )08, 6th and Defend and 20th ’se. The nrinci^cl measures were:- the foreign exchange Law of 6th Dsfand, 1308, and the Supplementary I-aw of Tir, 1309, (b) The Currency I-aw of S^th Dsfand, l' 7 (c) The Foreign Trade Monopoly Laws of Rsfand, 1309. The Foreign Exchange Law was intended to decrease the commercial demand and increase the supply of foreign exchange; actually it had the opposite effect, since no holder of foreign exchange sold it if he could ossibly avoid doing so, and everybody wanted to buy foreign exchange; the danger involved in black-market dealings served still further to increase the black-market rate. The Currency Law, in conjunction with the depreciation of the rial, in terms of foreign exchange at the black-market rate, caused a flight fro° tie currency into real estate; this in turn caused a rise in rents, inclur' those of shops and commercial premises, which in turn had an effect on general price level. The foreign Trade Monopoly laws gave to the handful of importers received licences under the quotas, a monopoly which enabled them to exr.ract abnormal profits from the consumer. This factor, together with the obligation to buy an export certificate, still further put un prices of 'imports. Nome uroducers were able to put up urices correspondingly, -b 6 responsibility for setting in motion the factors which have Led to the present high cost of living is the direct responsibility of the Government of that time, owing to ^b) ex ^ raV0 ^ an ^ foreign, exchange expenses, and ing c ; 1 e who Page 12) its wrongly conceived economic legislation. Whatshould have been done. ihe foreign exchange needed for the railway and industrial expansio. etc., should not have been taken from the sources normally devoted to im- morts needed for consumption, but from oil royalties and § foreign loan; ^11 this capital expenditure should have been Planned on a five or ten vear ^'lan in such a way that the sum to b e borrowed should not have been beyond the eventual resources of the country to repay. However, with these foreign exchange needs came increasing rial needs, ever-increasing budgets, and ever-increasing taxation. (The Author 'ere stresses that he is not opposed to taxation to increase the capital ■ealth of a country, but would only increase taxation for that purpose at a time /( 22z) - 2 - a time when private incomes were rising). The following fi ores illust 11 : the increase in government expenditure: 1301 (1922-23) - Budget was balanced at 206,000,000 Bials 1320 (19^1-42) - Budget was Balanced at 4,300,000,000 'Hals. That is to say budget expenditure has increase twenty-fold in eighteen years. fart of the income required to meet this expenditure came from ^irect taxes- these,., however, provided only 10 of the total tax revenue ' pared to the 30' which is obtained from this source in some countries. 'In tension of direct taxes was difficult owing to the general hostility caused by the extortion of officials who exploited for their own profit the pro visions of the badly drafted Income Tax Law. The government was therefore driven to meet the bulk of its increased expenditure from indirect taxes n monopolies’ these naturally had a direct effect on the cost of living and were especially felt by the poorer classes. hiat with heavy customs dutiec monopoly duos, and the municipal octroi, a family with an income of 30 Tomans a month has in recent years been ^aying least 10 Tomans to the 'government in indirect taxes and dues. ‘age 17) Economic Defects of this Policy. (1) The government has taken the earnings of the poorer classes and qassed it out as payment for government expenditure to a small class of cor. tractors and industrialists, thus creating a capital-holding class, while the rest of the country- ‘became steadily poe-rer. (2) Serious increase in general cost of living; 30°£ of the increr- in the cost of living between 1308 -^nd 1320 was due to increased indirect taxes and monopoly dues, (3) The rational Budget was inflated and this factor, in con.ju^r- with the rest of the government’s policy, caused a general loss of cor , in the currency* this loss of confidence had a direct effect on the cor . living since it caused a flight into land end Bouse property with a co ^ ouent effect on rents. rAoJ®. 19) nummary of ^actors increasing Cost of Living 1308-^1319. (1) Depreciation of rial in terms of foreign exchange. (2) heavy increase in indirect taxes and monopoly dues. (3) Increase in land values, with consequent rise in rents. Bach of these three factors accounted for approximately 30'' of t rise in the cost of living* the remaining 10'' was due to general causes • • i.ng out of the devebpment of the country, changes in ways of thought and lanner of living, as exemplified in the appearance of new consumption nee' such as cinemas, road a^d rail travel for pleasure, private cars, Buropea dress for women, and luxury spending by the new rich.

This rate should 'ally as far as possible with the purchasing power whjch would be enjoyed by a unit of currency convertible into Ip grammes of gold.. This rate would be the basic rate. Sub sequently, a committee would meet monthly in the National Bank to review the rate,. The committee would take the wholesale price of 10 or 20 essential commodities both imported and home produced, and would regard the total on the date of passing of the law as 100 6 The total of these wholesale prices would be made up once a month, and if it has risen or fallen, the con version rate will be altered accordingly. The first ten points in either direction would be ignored; thus if the wholesale pric total rose 17 r 1 the rial - gold Toman rate would go up 7&lt;. The official conversion rate would be Mnding for all Government •ransactions but not for private individuals who would be at liberty to use :ther rates. The National Bank would be authorised to open deposit accounts in ■old Tomans.

Government creditors and National Bank depositors would be entitled receive payment in the new money or in rials or in foreign exchange or in ’old at the rate of grammes per gold Toman, The advantages of introducing this unit of account are that wages an. salaries fixed am it would remain constant in proportion to the price level one would need to stock up or speculate to provide against possible futur •mvreciation of the currency.

It may well be our best policy to allow a substantial reserve to accumulate in Tehran. Assurance of adequacy of food supplies for Tehran during remaining months before harvest is not only an essential factor in political stability but will have great psychological value' in discouraging hoarding and speculation when new harvest is gathered and preventing a repetition of last year T s difficulties.

Sheridan's original proposals were in our opinion unsatisiactory in some respects, but Soheily insisted on allowing commission of deputies to revise them with the result that they are now worse. 2 . Government decree announces that they will take whole of landlord’s share (varying from one eighth to two fifths) of wheat and barley, leaving him his seed and in addition the whole of the first two tons plus a percentage (varying^from 30,% to 5 %) of the remainder. Peas.ants may sell their share in open market. 3. Price vail be 3,000 rials (£23.10) a ton except in frontier districts where special local commissions will be formed to recommend prices suited to each area. Price for barley will be three quarters that fixed for wheat and same price will be offered for giant millet, sale of which is, however, free. These prices will hold good till 22nd November only. From 23rd November to 20th February they will be reduced by one third and any balances then outstanding will be liable to confiscation without payment. 4-. It is very doubtful ’whether this scheme is in fact practicable, and it remains to be seen whether any real attempts will be made to put it into effect. The Ministry of Supply is now drafting supplementary regulations, and we are doing our best to see that these are as effective as possible. Insistence, against advice of American Advisor, on public announcement now that peasants are free to sell their shares may well wreck the whole scheme, but Ministry of Supply will counter by refusing to allow anyone but Government agents to buy. I do not see how resulting amateur patchwork combined with notorious inefficiency and corruption can be expected to succeed. 5. First commission is now proceeding to Ahwaz to try its fortune. It has already been delayed a fortnight whilst Ministers argue, and is still held up for lack of transport. It will consist of Loghman isi^ experienced and capable but reputed/~2~ m ■■ ■■■ reputed dishonest, and two young Americans. They promise to be guided by advice of our Consul-General who has been asked to assist, provided that he is satisfied that honest efforts are ^ fact being^made. Two Consular Liaison Officers will be made available if required* • Much, depends on price fixed and on black market rates prevailing in Iraq .and in Arab states in the Gulf, but harvest is already being reaped and each day's delay increases the difficulties. 6. No arrangements appear to be in train for other lowlying districts where harvest has begun, and Sheridan is away in Cairo for a fortnight, but we are pressing for action. Agents wording for Government may be able to buy a sufficient share of the bumper crops at the Government rate* and we are doing our bast to encourage this, especially in Pars, Kerman and Sistan. Tribal unrest, is, however, on the increase, and Government do little or nothing to maintain their authority and effect on wheat collection is likely to be serious. 7. ' The most important factor is the provision of ready money with which to pay for the crops, and although the despatch of fresh notes from the United Kingdom is being expedited, it is not certain that sufficient funds will be forthcoming. 3. In spite of this gloomy outlook there is quite a chance that if we can keep the Majlis and the Central Government fzom interfering too much, our Consuls and Consular Liaison Officers in the Southern provinces may succeed in influencing local officials, and so achieve a measure of success. There is still time for the Northern and Western provinces to profit by the experiences that will now be gained in the South.

SCH 1. I have just returned from an extensive tour of the Coutnern ui | areas where I have discussed the crop situation with Consuls ox* C.L.Os in Sultanabad, Ahwaki, Bushire, Shiraz, Isfahan and Kerman. The time has come to take stock of the situation with a view ^ to next year 1 s operations. e are, of course, criticised lor . contravening the tcras of tne Treaty and interfering in this matter., and on the other hand are blamed for not interfering enough, but as 2ar as I have been able to gatner the political effect of the C.L.Os work has on trie v/Yfole been re ib however no doubt tnat we are considered partly responsible lor the complete failure to collect this year’s harvest, and if, as seems only too likely, next year’s crop is similarly mismanaged, we snail be more seriously criticised and shall be unable really | to help unless the G.L.Os have very definite authority and unless the policy adopted is one of which we approve. \e nave three alternatives: (a) to hand over the organisation entirely to tne I Ministry of Supply if they will accept it; (b) to continue as at J present eitner' indefinitely or for a limited period; and (c) . , to liquidate the scheme. ' e must, I think, considei* these ; alternatives in relation to the policy which may be adopted by j the Persian Government. 2. It is out of the question to expect that any radical change j in the present system can be introduced this year as this would require a thought out scheme and probably legislation as well as the setting up of a new organisation to administer it. It seems, therefore, that the Persian Government has only three alternatives: (a) to remove all Government control and allow all transactions to be carried out freely through out the country; (b) to continue this year’s nominal policy of controlling the whole crop and buying only by Government at Government price both from landlords and peasants; and (c) to revert to the previous system of concentrating only on landlords’ undertakings and leaving the rest of the market free. 3. As regards (a), Government control of any sort, especially in a country such aL Persia, is a burdensome imposition, and should be avoided as far as po;tible, but all opinion which I have consulted is agreed that it is not possible to remove ail Government conti'ol over wheat and barley in spite of the expectations of a bumper harvest, as th power of profiteers and speculators Is too great. 4. As regards (b) , it is now abundantly clear that Sheridan’s attempt to control the whole harvest has been a more disastrous failure than was anticipated by &lt;ven the most pessimistic observer. It has, in fact, bten a mei%**farc0. That Sheridan himself has at last realised this has been shown by the recent circular which he has sent round saying that all previous instructions are cancelled and ordering local authorities to concentrate purely on the collection of undertakings from landlords. The Anti-Hoarding law, of which such high hopes were entertained, has proved a farce, as holders of stocks were quick to divide and conceal their hoards and Government have proved without exception unwilling to take any steps whatever against even the most blatant offences in the matter of w r heat. The whole policy has in fact been vitiated ab init io by the fact that in spite of Government’s so-called monopoly permits to buy on the black market have all along been fre«. ly given to certain areas/areas for their own needs; and in fact the granting of such p rmits was inevitable. The whole theory of control of the whole crop is based on a fundamental misconception of conditions in Persia. vThere never has be&lt; n and never can be control ov r large rural areas where Government authority is wea&amp; and where the population are normally se If -supporting'. If, however, the Gov rnme.nt again try and establish a theoretical monopoly they must appoint r a PaTge number yof officers- with reliable subordinates, all of whom, it goes pvitnout saying, must be foreigners with full executive authority. ^vs the Americans are in pontrol it seems quite out of the question j^that v;e should take -any part in such an organisation, which would require Some 5*0 to 4 60 officials with full eyecutive authority \worKing directly under the Ministry of Supply. If the American adviser wishes to attempt such a policy the responsibility must be his and it is v ry questionable whether H.M.G. snould associate itself with this responsibility. *. '4,&gt;^ ^ J f % i j K ± II \ r ,X U * lO S fli b. There remains therefore (c), and in spite of the fact that all expert economic opinion is against me, it is my considered view, and the view of nearly all those with any knowledge of the country with whom I have discussed the question, tnat the only practicable course jf is to concentrate entirely on the landlords 1 undertakings and to leave all the remainder of the country free. Price control will never work in a country like Iran in which it is almost impossible to describe or to make any outsider believe in the bottomless pit of corruption which goes under the name of Administration. In India, which is tol rably veil run, price control has been aUmpted and Governm-nt have admitted their mistake and have abandoned it. How much more is it impracticable in a country like this. The system of undertakings is v/ell understood and it dots not require a very great deal of for ign .^nt rference to make it work, ily opinion is that best of all would b^^for the American Adviser to the Ministry of Supply to take over the whole of our C.L.O. organisation and such of our officers as can be spared and are willing to serve the Persian Gov rnment, to implement this policy. The'se officers could be termed, perhaps, Regional Superintendents. If the Persian Government do not wish to do this I recommend that the C.L.Os snould continue to give such help as they can for a limited p* riod only, say until the end of August, by which time undertakings should have been collected, and the Persian Government must then be solely responsible for pusning forward the collection of these undertakings. But if any other policy i adopted I tnink that H.M.G, should wash thrir hands of the whole matter except as observers, “jfm that G.L.Oe as such should be abolished. • ;JPOREIGN STAFF WHICH MR. 3H i.RlfiUI HOI&gt;Ea TO ]IAV^ AT HIS DISPOSAL FC.I OF 1943. and iB unlikely to be allowed by the Russians to return there. u*. dheridan hopes to secure as Inspector-General. to be Inspector of the Southern, Region.

SherlioA himself may possibly be willing but the Minister of Supply Taddayun has already been got at by the deput|*and has asked that Consular liaison officers &gt;v ) should refrain from direct interference with the administration ■ 1! ^ the present Prime Minister will do nothing to offend Parliament and weaken his own position. 2. We have in fact just got three new Consular liaison officers, Shipton for Kermanshah, Foiling and Gulzar Ahmed for Khuzistan and have asked Paiforce for Lance Corporal Joel as assistant in Shiraz. In our opinion the best hope of success lies in the extension of the existing scheme of forv/ard contracts to be entered on behalf of the Persian Government by approved persons with our assistance to buy both landlords’ and peasants' shares at government price v/hich is adequate. The assistance of three or four experienced wheat buyers working directly under Sheruto/* if obtainable might be of use, especially if they could bring their own transport, but as anything we do must be in co-operation with Shenirfav^ who is now in Cairo, perhaps he could be consulted first.

IMMEDIATE IMMEDIATE Details of present Persian Government's proposals for cereal collection in 1943-1944 though impressive on paper do not encourage me to hope that the position will be any better than in the past season. I believe the only chance of remedying the situation is by an extension of the principle embodied in C.L.O. organisa tion. 2, I am prepared to approach Paiforce for a suitable number (that you mighx suggest) of British army officers, if you think the Persian Government would accept the proposal. I know they have already been asked to consider the employment- of such officers and that their reply has been less than luke-warm. I am aware &gt; that the work'of the C.L.O.S. has been made extremely difficult and has been handicapped by lack of executive powers from the v/' Central Government: it is therefore essential, if further officers ; are appointed, that the Persian Government should give them such authority as is necessary for the successful carrying out of their i duties, * # 3, We do not believe that technical knowledge of wheat growing is necessary in these officers but that they should have reasonable ability and common sense. 4, Can you persuade the Persian Government to do so - if not I very much doubt whether it would be wise for us to associate ourselves still further with the collection scheme. 5,. The critical period for assessment of crops and allocation of collection quotas is already at hand but you may feel [? gp. omit. ? it] to be still worth while at this late date to attempt to inject an element of honesty and authority into the organisation. Without, I feel convinced the local land-owners and hoarders will find means with the connivance of the Central Government of sabotaging any plan Mr, Sheridan may succeed in getting adopted.

Sir, | g 4 V 1 I have the honour to-'t ra'hsrqit--4wH?ewi th a translation of Decree-No. 35494 of the Persian Council of Ministers, concerning forward purchases of foodstuffs, which was putMshed in the Ministry of roj^tice Oazette No. 4225 of the Tsf and 1321 (March 11th, 1 943). . 3 i a-Tf 1 'r : co 5 ’ 10 a i XiianoO 2. This enactment, vvhich forbids all forward transactions in foodstuffs on pain of imprisonment and payment of a fine, is the first shot in the Persian' Government Os campaign -to secure for itself a greater share in the produce of the next harvest than it has been able to obtain from last year's crop. 3. Article 5 of the new decree exempts the Government, Government banks and municipalities from the ban on forward transmission and Mr. Sheridan, the Adviser to the Ministry of Supply, is in fact considering the possibility of the Government making forward purchases of the forthcoming wheat crop. 'Thether he will succeed in doing so depends partly on the ability of the Government to make the new decree effective and prevent it from degenerating like so many other regulations into a source if income for officials who are prex^ared to connive at infringements, and partly on the efficiency of his own wheat buying arrangements. Mr* Sheridan is hoping to bring here from the United States of America a number of experienced wheat buyers to v/ork under him and if these arrive in time and if their activities are not hampered by lack of ready cash Right Honourable R.G* Casey, D.S.O., M.C., His Majesty's Minister of State, Cairo.Copy Ministry of Justice Gazette No. 4 2k&amp; jol*' Oth &gt;isfand 1^1 (11/5/43) 21 74 D jCRES OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS NO. 55494 . With the object of providing foodstuffs and assuring the welfare of farmers, preventing the activities of certain profiteers who intend to buy up the essential foodstuffs and preventing possible dangers which may arise as. the result of hoarding or shortage of food articles, the Council of Ministers by virtue of the authority granted by the single Article Law approved on the 24th Khordad lo2l (14th June 1942), approved in their sitting of the 8th Isfand 1321 (26th February 1943) the following articles to be put into force. Art. 1. Any person who buys or sells forward wheat, barley, rice, potatoes, dates or edible grains (hububat) or makes any transaction with the object of transferring or making over such products before the. harvest and the gathering of the harvest will be condemned to correctional imprisonment from two months to one year and to a cash fine from Rials 500 to 10,000; in the event of repetition he will be condemned to correctional imprisonment from 6 months to 3 years and to a cash fine from Rials 1,000 to 50,000. Note: Any transactions mentioned in this Article will be null and void and no legal effect will be given to them. Art. 2. Any person who acts as intermediary in transactions concerning the goods mentioned in Article 1 will be condemned to correctional imprisonment from 2 to 6 months and to a cash fine from Rials 500 to 5,000, and in the event of repetition to correctional imprisonment from 5 months to 2 years and to a cash fine^from Rials 5,000 to 50,000. /Should/''N rm i$e irt Should the intermediary be a broker (Dallal) he will, in addition to the above penalties, be suspended from the exercise of his profession from one to six months. Art. 3. Forward transactions made prior to the date of this Decree in respect of goods mentioned in Article 1 on account of the 13S2 crop will be of no effect, and the seller must pay to the buyer the sum involved in the transaction by the time of gathering of crop at the latest. • -io : 1 - - ao —i •' or - _ • - r Art.o 4.

Soviet offer was made to Persian Prime Minister on i.pril 10th and I regret that you were not informed at the time. 2. Previous Russian promises of assistance^ Persian wheat problem have led to very littleand it remains to be seen whether the present otfer is an exception. We do not therefore consider that there is any reason why we should interrupt our own x r the supply of wheat to Persia.^ We and the united States Government are in any case definitely committed to supply at least 25,000 tons of wheat to Persia and this commitment was not conditional on the absence of supplies from^other sources. Effect on Anglo-American prestige in Persia would be disastrous if we were to make Russian offer an excuse for not fulfilling our own undertakings. Moreover, it is urgently necessary to create a small reserve of wheat at Tehran. ' It is many months since the Persian Government had more than a few days’ supply on hand and political stabilitj cannot be expected so long as the food supply of the people is not assured. Again South Persia has hitherto had g very short on account of the needs of tne capital, and relief of scarcity in the South is becoming more and more imperative. 3. If the United States shipping authorities should take the line that the Russian offer matos it unnecessary to send further wheat [^om North ^crica I hone that these arguments will enable you and tne btate Department to convince them that we must continue shipments.

Disingenuousness of Soviet memorandum can be judged from what appears to be the deliberate confusion of the Northern Provinces as a whole with Azerbaijan their most fertile part, and from the fact that according to the figures previously reported for supplies to Tehran for period ending December 26th the 'material assistance' offered by Russians produc-ed: •87 tons only from Azerbaijan proper as against 9,000 from British areas, 10,000 imported and 1*3,000 local.

It is of some interest that receipts in Tehran silo from Gurgan area in seven weeks prior to February 14th, the date of Soviet memorandum, were 613 tons only while in next 15 days approximately 578 tons of grain were delivered to Tehran witn another 800 tons during March. It seems certain that express orders had been given to increase rate of deliveries from Gurgan both in an effort to maintain Government and also to do something retrospective to make good the fantastic assertion that 20.000 tons of grain had been delivered to Tehran from Northern provinces up to the beginning of February; but in Azerbaijan apart from insisting on the delivery of their own requirements Soviet authorities arc still unwilling to tolerate active intervention on the part of Central Government to collect any of the remaining surplus for Tehran, and it is significant that .they have evicted Vivian the American especially deputed by Sherrt^ to Azerbaijan to organise collections.
