I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a letter, dated the 14th August, which has been addressed to this Department by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company on the subject of the negotiations now pending with the Ottoman Government on the subject of the navigation of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates.* Sir E. Grey fears that confusion will be caused if collateral correspondence is carried on with the company respecting a question cognate to that in which, so he understands, you are acting for the company or for its chairman, Mr. Lynch, in your communications with this Department. 1 am accordingly directed to make the following observations in reply to the company’s letter, and to request that you will be so good as to communicate it to them for their confidential information :— Sir E. Grey regrets that the company should have allowed three months to elapse, from the date of the memorandum of the 19th May, before making the communication which forms the subject of the letter under reply. The agreement, which has been under negotiation with the Ottoman Government, provides for the grant of a new concession for a period of sixty years, with subsequent renewals at the option of the Ottoman Government for periods of ten years, and with the condition that, if the concession should be terminated, the hoider of it would still have the right of navigation, though not, as during the concession, monopoly rights with certain reservations. It has not been found practicable to induce the Ottoman Government to agree to the new concession (which is very advantageous in the general interests of British trade and in which Mr. Lynch or his company has still the opportunity of participation) except in return for the acquiescence of His Majesty’s Government in the limitation, which de facto exists and has long been maintained, of the rights actually enjoyed by this country under previous agreements, but Sir E. Grey is happy to be able to state, for the information of your clients, that he has succeeded in securing that the rights actually enjoyed by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (rights which the Ottoman Government have always hitherto persisted in maintaining were provisional and subject to cancellation, and which, in regard to the third steamer, were expressly stated to be provisional at the time they were conceded) should henceforth be regarded as permanent, and that they should include the right to navigate by means of electricity or any other motive power.

Oth August,1913. i c# a Sir:- J Vt : ith reference to my telegram No. 62 of July 28th last I am informed that the five steam-tugs provided by the Society de Transports fluviaux viz. *3hirin', 'Sheytan', 'Shehab', “Shuhrur', and 'Sunana'' for forwarding the Bagdad railway material are all declared to be unsatisfactory by Messrs. Lynch Brothers local agents. Four of them have broken down and the machinery of the fifth, which was used to replace parts of the broken gear in another of the launches, appears to be no better. The tugs are twin screw vessels and the shafts and connections are said to be too weak to stand the constant jerking and strain of turning the sharp bends of the river. New shafts will have to be made in England and forwarded and great delay will no doubt occur. The fault seems to lie entirely with the machinery and the hulls themselves are strong enough to tow the heavy barges.

It will be remembered that the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company explained to the Foreign Office that one of the chief advantages of their taking up the contract for forwarding the material was that the vessels would all be constructed in English yards and under the special supervision of their firm’s consulting engineers.

Minute by Mr. Parker. . vN i f, C&gt;'' ' /.V . ^ % I HAD a further interview with Hakki Pasha to-day to initial the annexed further declaration about the navigation and to settle finally about the terms of a guarantee connected with Lord Inchcape’s concession. Hakki Pasha told me that the King of Greece had given orders to the Greek Commander-in-Chief at Dedeagatch only to hand over the place to Turkish troops, as His Majesty feared to hand over to Bulgarians any territory where there were Greek residents, as to do so would be to pass sentence of certain death upon them. Moreover, the King of Greece had, though His Majesty wished this treated as confidential for the present, issued a direct invitation* to the Ottoman Government to occupy Dedeagatch. Hakki Pasha then said that the situation was briefly this : the Ottoman forces had reoccupied Adrianople and there they would remain until they were ejected by force, which it was becom ing increasingly clear would not take place. They (he., the Ottoman Government) would probably agree to a line which would give Kirk Kilisse to the Bulgarians, and give them access to the sea on the Aegean, provided Europe gave adequate guarantees that any territory occupied by Bulgaria would be so governed, under European supervision, that the non-Bulgarian population would not be exterminated. How was it, he asked, that the Mussulman population received the Greek forces with open arms, and fled before Bulgarian troops. If any of the territory now occupied by Turkey were uncon ditionally handed back to Bulgaria the adminis tration would simply be handed over to Komitadjis. But Europe did nothing when Mussulmans were concerned, as witness their treatment in Crete : in this case, however, Greeks were also involved. * Reshid Safver Bey told M. de Fleuriau that he had seen the letter conveying this invitation. c tv I2 Turkey, he said, must have the Maritza line and she must have Adrianople which was essenUal for the protection of Co'nop Adrianople with Constantinople. _ I said I was not authorised to discuss t lese questions with him, hut it seemed to nm t a every day the Turks were making their ultimate ejection from Adrianople more certain^ by acting on the principle of “ grasp all, lose all.’ t± t rey went on penetrating beyond the Maritza questions of prestige would arise, and very unpleasant developments might ensue. We then passed to the Bagdad Railway. He said Herr von Kuehlmann had had a reply from Herr von Gwinner respecting the proposal that he should come to London, and he said that this would be impossible, but had suggested that Hakld Pasha should go to Zurich from the 22nd August to the 25th August in order to meet Herr von Gwinner and Herr Helfenich there : this would help matters forward a good deal as between the Turks and the Bagdad Railway Company, and Hakki Pasha was in favour of going. I said I thought it would be an excellent thing, only I hoped it would really get things ahead a bit. He is therefore going on the 22nd August, and he expects to be back on the 1st September, after visiting The Hague. He then hopes to complete our negotiations very rapidly. This will give Mr. Weakley and me time to discuss the outstanding questions fully with the Board of Trade. I told Hakki Pasha that we should probably ask for petroleum concessions in Syria and Farsan and he said he would ask for instructions. I also said we should probably ask for an extension of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway concession and line, and he said he anticipated no difficulty on this account if our wishes did not run counter to those of the' Germans, which he did not think likely to prove to be the case. I then said that if he spoke to Herr von Gwinner as to the oil concession in Mesopotamia (which he told me he intended to do) it might be well for him (Hakki) to know that His Majesty’s Government did not consider, and knew that the Ottoman Government’s legal advisers did not consider, the German claims under the Anatolian Railway Agreement of 1904 to be very strong, although3 the Germans had certain limited though not exclusive claims under the Bagdad Railway con cession of 1904. The two original claimants therefore were, in order of priority, the Auglo- Persian Company (Mr. d’Arcy) and the Bagdad Railway Company. Why was it necessary to introduce fresh elements, like the Shell and the National Bank of Turkey ? Herr von Gwinner had already said he was willing to accept a minor share, and it seemed far simpler not to introduce additional parties. Hakki Pasha said that he was not sure how far Herr von Gwinner was bound to the National Bank and the Shell (Anglo-Saxon) group, hut as he understood the National Bank was, if necessary, prepared to go out voluntarily, he thought it might be possible to arrange for some combination between the Anglo-Persian Company and the Germans. I said that of course His Majesty’s Government would have to be consulted about the details of any such arrangement. He agreed, and said he would discuss the whole question with Herr von Gwinner. A.

Lieutenant-Colonel Picot to Mr. Parker.—{Received August 19.) Dear Parker, 33, Onslow Gardens, London, August 15, 1913. IN handing you a confidential print, which has been prepared for the Board of my Company (“ Euphrates and Tigris Navigation. (No. 2 ): Proceedings in Parliament and Explanatory Documents, 1913 ”), together with a summary of the same which has been drawn up for the convenience of the Secretary of State, I desire to make it clear that my colleagues and myself are not animated by any contentious spirit. We have endeavoured to arrive at the true facts of the case with the object of laying them before the Foreign Office in the expectation that justice will be done. The one matter personal to myself is that of the negotiations for the formation of a Turkish company under British control to replace the existing Turkish line of steamers on the Tigris, with which I was intimately _ connected for several years, and concerning which there still appears to be a serious misunderstanding in respect of the relations between the Foreign Office and my company. These negotiations were proceeding in one form or another during the years 1907-10, and I was closely connected with them both in London and in my capacity of special _ repre sentative of my company in Constantinople. I was in constant touch both with our Ambassador in Constantinople and with the Foreign Office here, and to the best of my belief I had the fullest support of both. As regards the “ fusion ’’ scheme of 1909, you will find an explanation on p. 8 of Print No. 2 in an account of an interview I had with Lord Hardinge on this very subject on the 20 th September, 1910. The £{ fusion” was proposed by the Turks to me as the only feasible method of putting the matter through at that time. I consulted His Majesty’s Ambassador before proceeding with it. He informed me that the proposal had his approval. . His Majesty’s Ambassador was kept fully informed of every step m the negotia tions, and I fancy he must have been heartily sick of seeing me on the subject. I should be obliged if you would lay the summary of Print No. 2 before bir E. Grey, and would attach to it this letter, in order that Sir E. Grey may see it. ^ Summary of Confidential Print respecting Euphrates and Tigris Navigation.

In June 1909 Sir George Mackenzie agreed to withdraw for the time from competition, and he induced other British firms m M o- potamia to withdraw active opposition to the Lynch fusion scheme, and from then, until the breakdown of negotiations in July 1910, British diplomatic support was given to Mr. Lynch’s scheme. The answer to the fourth question in so far as concerns the reso lution of the Ottoman Chamber, is in the affirmative. The answer to the fifth question is that the resolution stipulated that there should be no financial liability, as proposed under the scheme, upon the Turkish Treasury, and the Turkish Government declined tp proceed with it because considerable opposition to it was manifested in Lagdad anu Basra, and a strong feeling against it developed in the Turkish Chamber m view oi that opposition. The answer to the sixth question is that the proposal is to form an Ottoman company with British participation, and at the same time to safeguard and confirni the rights actually enjoyed by the existing British company, of which ^Mr. Lynch is chairman. The answer to the last question is that I am concerned with the general interests of British trade in those regions rather than with the particular advantage of an individual firm ; that, with this object in view, I do not consider it the most desirable solution that the existing British company should have a monopoly of and control over the whole navigation. The arrangement contemplated would secure to the existing British company the confirmation of its existing separate privileges, and the offer of participation in the capital of, and a fair working agreement with, the proposed new Ottoman company. “Earl of Ronaldshay asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the nature of the assurances which he has received from the German Government on the subject of the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates ; and will he give the House an opportunity of considering the terms of the proposed convention with Turkey, together with the cognate arrangements with the German Government, before the convention is actually concluded ? “ SirE. Grey. —I cannot at present make any statement respecting the negotiations on this subject, which are still in progress. The arrangements, when completed, will be laid before Parliament, but it would not he usual or practicable to make their conclusion dependent upon previous discussion in the House.” It is quite evident that the Secretary of State has been misinformed in giving this answer. We will take the questions and answers one by one. “ 1 . Question .—During how many years the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers had been conducted by the ‘ Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company ’ ? “ Answer .—The company named has, under strict limitations, participated in, but not conducted, the whole navigation of the Tigris since 1862.” It is important to note that no limitations were mentioned by the Foreign Office to the founders of the company, when the founders approached the Foreign Office in1862 before actually forming the company. (See Foreign Office letter of the 17th February, I860, Print No. 2 , page 7.) Subsequently to the formation of the company, the Turkish Government have all along sought to impose limitations on the number of steamers to be employed. In spite of these attempts, the company has been able to increase its fleet through negotiation. Thus, within the last twelve years, they have increased their fleet in this way to the extent of being able to deal with a volume of cargo almost three times as great as before. (Print No. 2 , p. 21 .) “ 2 . Question.—Whether the company is a British company, flying the British flag ? “ Answer.—The answer is in the affirmative. “ 3. Question .—Whether the company, with the approval of His Majesty’s Govern ment, entered into negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1909 with a view to the foundation of a new Turkish company under its management, to take over the Turkish Government steamers plying upon the rivers ? “ Answer .—The reply to the third question is- in the negative, for His Majesty’s Government were not aware of the commencement of the negotiations in 1909.” The negotiations in 1909 were undertaken by the company, not only with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, but in consequence of pressure brought to bear upon the company by the Foreign Office. On the 22 nd October, 1908, Colonel Picot, director of the British company, visited the Foreign Office, and saw Sir C. Hardinge, who had, on more than one occasion, clearly given Colonel Picot to understand that, if his company were not prepared to negotiate for the control of the Turkish steamers other British firms were. During the course of this interview Sir C. Hardinge observed that the civil list of the Sultan would probably now be needing money; and he urged that the company’s representative in Constantinople should watch the situation very olosely, so that the first favourable opportunity might be taken to open negotiations. During the course of this same interview Sir C. Hardinge mentioned for the first time the possibility that the British company might have to drop the British flag in arriving at an amalgamation of interests with the Turkish steamer adminis tration. Early in 1909 Colonel Picot was in Constantinople with the object of giving effect to the wishes expressed by Sir C. Hardinge. The situation had, in the meanwhile, been closely watched by the company’s representative in that city, Mr. E. Whittall; and he reported on the 9 th February, 1909, by which time Colonel Picot had already arrived, that the Minister of the Civil List had at last made up his mind to transfer the Turkish steamers to a private company, and was prepared to entertain offers. Colonol Picot was instructed by his colleagues to do his best to arrive at an arrangement under which the question of the flag on the British steamers should not be raised at all. This he found himself unable to effect. Messrs. Picot and Whittall then drew out a scheme creating a single Ottoman company under British control, which should absorb both the Turkish line of steamers and the British line. The scheme had the full approval of the British Ambas sador in Constantinople, Sir G. Lowther ; and as the Sultan might have to abdicate at any moment, when the steamers would probably be transferred from the civil list to a Government department, and fresh negotiations would have to be commenced, Colonel Picot was authorised by telegraph on the 1 st April, 1909. to sign the contract, subject to the approval of Sir G. Lowther. That approval had already been given, but it was unfortunately impossible actually to conclude the transaction before the Sultan was deposed. (See Print No. 2 , pp. 8 , 9, 15.) “ 4 . Question. —Whether, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the scope of these negotiations was subsequently enlarged so as to include the British company and a resolution passed by the Ottoman Chamber authorising the Turkish Government to conclude the transaction with the British company ? “ Answer .—The reply to the fourth question, in so far as concerns the attitude ol His Majesty’s Government, is that the negotiations for the fusion of the British and Turkish companies were entered into by Mr. Lynch in 1909 without knowledge of the Foreign Office, who, in that year, first obtained information on the subject from the late Sir G. Mackenzie, of the British India Steam Navigation Company; he had been negotiating, with the approval and support of His Majesty’s Government, since the year 1901 for control over the Turkish line of steamers. In June 190}9 Sir G. Mackenzie agreed to withdraw for the time from competition, and he induced other British firms of Mesopotamia to withdraw active opposition to the Lynch fusion scheme,4 and from then until the breakdown of negotiations in July 1910 British diplomatic sutoport was given to Mr. Lynch’s scheme. .a, ™ r 4 -r “ The answer to the fourth question, in so far as concerns the resolution of the Ottoman Chamber, is in the affirmative. The facts are that the British company have negotiated with the Turkish company for the control of the Turkish steamers, with the approval and support ot their own Government, in 1887, 1907, 1908, and 1909. In 1887 the scheme reached the stage of receiving the approval of the “ conseil ffigiste ’ at Constantinople. In 1907 the British company despatched no less than three special missions to Constantinople with this- object. These missions had the full approval of the British Government. In 1908 Colonel Picot was again in charge of a special mission of this nature, from the middle of February, with ^the full support of the British Foreign Office and the British Ambassador. During 1909 Colonel Picot’s mission extended for many months, and he was assisted throughout by Mr. E. Whittall. The particular form given to the negotiations during 1909, namely, *a fusion between the British company and the Turkish steamers, received the approval of the British Ambassador, after having already been mentioned to Colonel Picot by the Foreign Office in the autumn of 1908, as a possible solution of the question. (Print No. 2 , p. 14.) Mr. Lynch was in Constantinople during the course of these negotiations. If the Foreign Office were not informed by the British Ambassador himself of the form which the negotiations had taken, that is an oversight which it is difficult to explain. The course of the various negotiations is traced with some detail in Print No. 2 , pp. 11—17. Special reference should also be made to pp. 8 and 9 of Print No. 2 . The relations of the British company to the late Sir George Mackenzie, and the attitude taken up in this question by Sir G. Mackenzie, are set out on pp. 9, 10 , 13, 14, and 15 of Print No. 2 , where Sir G. Mackenzie’s owm letters are quoted. Sir G. Mackenzie’s attitude towards the British company in respect of negotiations for the control of the Turkish steamers may be summarised in his own words to the effect that he had no intention of taking the place of the British company, and that he onlv desired to see possible competitors in Mesopotamia kept away from the river. Over and over again he described his own overtures at the Foreign Office as designed to “keep the door open ” for action by the British company. As regards the negotiations of 1909, Sir E. Grey has been completely misinformed when he states that in June 1909 Sir George Mackenzie agreed to withdraw for the time from competition. If he was ever competing, which he himself would have denied, he had certainly withdrawn in the early spring of 1909, when he authorised Mr. Lynch to telegraph to Colonel Picot, in Constantinople, that he concurred that a preponderating share in the proposed new T Ottoman company should be acquired by the British company. Sir E. Grey is also misinformed when he states that Sir G. Mackenzie induced other British firms in Mesopotamia to withdraw from active opposition to the fusion scheme. The British company themselves approached all the leading British firms, and Sir E. Grey would appear to have been misled by the fact that the memorial in fa\ om of the scheme, which was addressed to the Foreign Office by the British firms on the 10 th March, 1910, was sent m by the late Sir George Mackenzie’s fir m . The reason for that was that it seemed to the directors of the British company more tactful that such a memorial should oe transmitted by one of the firms concerned rather than by themselves. The text of the memorial in favour of the fusion scheme is given in Print No 2 p. 10 . 5. Question. Whether this resolution has been given effect to, and if not for what reason has it not ? ^ ^ ns ^f r ;— The answer to the fifth question is that the resolution stipulated that there should be no financial liability, as proposed under the scheme, upon the Turkish treasury, and the Turkish Government declined to proceed with it because considerable opposition to it was manifested m Bagdad and Basra, and a strong feeling against it developed m the Turkish Chamber m view of that opposition.’’ This answer would seem to infer that the scheme broke down for two reasons. First, because it involved financial liability upon the Turkish Treasury ; and secondly because a strong feeling against it developed in the Turkish Chamber owing to loca opposition in Bagdad and Basra. The facts, however, are as follows : First, theprovisions in the scheme involving financial liability upon the Turkish Treasury were dropped ; and, secondly, after hearing all about the local opposition at Bagdad and Basra, the Turkish Chamber passed the resolution authorising the Government to grant the concession by 168 votes to 8 votes. (See Print No. 2 , p. 16.) “ 6 . Question .—Will he say if His Majesty’s Government are seeking to make it a 'condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties that a monopoly of the navigation of these rivers shall be granted for a period of sixty years to a new Anglo-Turkish company distinct from the existing British company ? “ Answer .—The answer to the sixth question is that the proposal is to form an Ottoman company with British participation, and at the same time to safeguard and confirm the rights actually enjoyed by the existing British company, of which Mr. Lynch is chairman.” It will be noticed that this answer avoids the kernel of the question, namely, whether it is proposed to endow the new Ottoman company with exclusive rights or, in other words, to create a monopoly for it. As for safeguarding and confirming the rights of the existing British company, Sir E. Grey was careful to add the words “ actually enjoyed.” The British Government have always maintained that the rights of the British company could not justly be limited by the Turkish Government to those which they actually enjoyed; and it is in consequence of this contention on the part of their Government that the British company have been able, during the last twelve years, practically to treble the resources of their fleet through negotiations with the Turkish Government. The British Government now propose to limit the rights of the British company to the extent to which that company have been able, up to 1913, to obtain recognition of those rights. Thus, in the same convention, which is to bestow upon a stranger to tbe navigation the right of placing steamers on the Euphrates and ligris, without any restriction as to numbers, a clause is to be inserted stereotyping for ever the position of the British company. The British company will then be limited to three steamers, while the new company will be empowered to employ any number. It is quite true that Sir E. Grey does not state in his answer that he proposes under the convention to limit the rights of the British company to those which they actually enjoy. Nor does he state that the new Ottoman company is to enjoy exclusive rights. Indeed, the natural construction of his answer is that he proposes to do neither of these things. Of course, if exclusive rights are not to be conferred on the new Ottoman company, and if the British company are to have then present position safeguarded without any restriction as to the future, the situation would be a very different one to that which we believe to be the real situation. “ 7 . Question .—If so, will he say for what reason it is sought^ to take the formation of the proposed new company out of the hands of the existing British omP“ Answer. —The answer to the last question is that I am concerned with the general interests of British trade in those regions rather than with the particular advantage of an individual firm; that, with this object in view, I do not consider it the most desirable solution that the existing British company should have a monopoly of and control over the whole navigation. The arrangement contemplated would secure to the existing British company the confirmation of its existing separate privileges, and the offer of participation in the capital of, and a fair working agreement with, the proposed new Ottoman company. We have reason to believe the actual facts to be the follo'wmg . It is proposed to bestow upon the chairman of the British India Steam Navigation Company the monopoly of and control over the whole navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris with the exception of three steamers belonging to the Britisn company, which are to be prohibited from ever increasing their fleet. The participation in the capital of the new Ottoman company which is offered to the British company is one-sixth of the whole, whereas the chairman of the British India Company, a complete stranger to the navigation, is to be allowed more than one-third. Neither the British company nor their agents are to have any share whatever in the management of the new Ottoman company, which is, of course, the lucrative part of the business. Even the wor mg agreement which is offered could not be rendered effective, under such conditions as regards participation, over a long period of years. Without any effective voice m the control and management of the new Ottoman company, how could the British company, limited [1825 t—1] ‘ C6 to their three steamers, survive for sixty years alongside of the Ottoman company as an independent and prosperous company ? Sir E. Grey’s reference to the general interests of British trade in those regions has a curious sound when it is remembered that it is the chairman of t J nd ‘ a f line who is to be invested with the monopoly over the traffic on t e nvers of Mesopotamia. There are several other British hues of steamers plying to the Persian 1 Gulf and the advantage to the British India line over them rivals, once they have obtained control over the river traffic, is too obvious to require assertion The British company on the Tigris are, on the other hand, not connected with any of the ocean lines, and they have always meted out equal measure to all or them. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Euphrates and Tigris Navigation (Print No. 2): Proceedings in Parliament and Explanatory Documents (1913). (No 1 ).— Extract from Official Report of Parliamentary Debates, Tuesday, July 22, 1913. 1 . Earl of Ronaldshay asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs if he will state during how many years the navigation of the Euphrates and digris Fivers has been conducted by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company; 2 . Whether the company is a British company flying the British flag; 3. Whether the company, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, entered into negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1909 with a view to the foundation of a new Turkish company, under its management, to take over the Turkish Government steamers plying upon the rivers ; 4. Whether, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the scope of these negotiations was subsequently enlarged so as to include the British company and a resolution passed by the Ottoman Chamber authorising the Turkish Government to conclude the transaction with the British company ; 5. Whether this resolution has been given effect to and, if not, for what reason has it not; 6 . Will he say if His Majesty’s Government are seeking to make it a condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties that a monopoly of the navigation of these rivers shall be granted for a period of sixty years to a new Anglo- Turkish company distinct from the existing British company; 7. And, if so, will he say for what reason it is sought to take the formation of the proposed new company out of the hands of the existing British company. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir E. Grey): The reply to the first question is that the company named has, under strict limitations, participated in, but not conducted, the whole navigation of the Tigris since 1862 ; the reply to the second question is in the affirmative ; the reply to the third question is in the negative for His Majesty s Government were not aware of the commencement of negotiations in 1909 ; the reply to the fourth question, in so far as concerns the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, is that the negotiations for the fusion of the British and Turkish companies were entered into by Mr. Lynch in 1909 without knowledge of the Foreign Office, who, in that year, first obtained information on the subject from the late Sir G. Mackenzie, of the British India Steam Navigation Company; he had been negotiating, with the approval and support of His Majesty’s Government, since the }mar 1901, for control over the Turkish line of steamers. _ In June 1901 Sir George Mackenzie agieed to withdraw for the time from competition, and he induced other British firms in esopotamia to withdraw active opposition to the Lynch fusion scheme, and from then, I 111 * ^ f (0 1 wn °f negotiations in July 1910, British diplomatic support was given to r Lynch s scheme. The answer to the fourth question, in so far as concerns the resolution of the Ottoman Chamber, is in the affirmative. The answer to the fifth qut o ion is at t e lesolution stipulated that there should be no financial liability, as proposed under the scheme, upon the Turkish Treasury, and the Turkish Government T , eC ' ne 1 ° piocee with it because considerable opposition to it was manifested in • agdat ar ! d Bassra, and a strong feeling against it developed in the Turkish Chamber m view of that Opposition, The answer to the sixth question is that the proposal is toform an Ottoman company with British participation, and at the same time to safeguard and confirm the rights actually enjoyed by the existing British company, of which Mr. Lynch is chairman. The answer to the last question is that I am concerned with the general interests of British trade in those regions rather than with the particular advantage of an individual firm ; that, with this object in view, I do not consider it the most desirable solution that the existing British company should have a^monopoly of and control over the whole navigation. The arrangement contemplated would secure to the existing British company the confirmation of its existing separate privileges, and the offer of participation in the capital of, and a fair working agreement with, the proposed new Ottoman company. Earl of Bonaldshay asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the nature of the assurances which lie has received from the German Government on the subject of the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates; and will he give the House an opportunity of considering the terms of the proposed convention with Turkey, together with the cognate arrangements with the German Government, before the convention is actually concluded ? Sir E. Grey: I cannot at present make any statement respecting the negotiations on this subject which are still in progress. The arrangements when completed will be laid before Parliament, but it would not be usual or practicable to make their conclusion dependent upon previous discussion in the House. (No. 2 .)— Comments on Sir Edward Grey's Answers to Lord Bonaldshay's Questions. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company was founded in 1862 by the firm of Messrs. Lynch Brothers. This firm had previously conducted the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris by means of large wooden vessels flying the British flag. When steam propulsion had become general in Europe, and subsequent to the two British Government expeditions to the Euphrates and Tigris for the purpose of surveying the rivers of Mesopotamia, during which a number of steamers, flying the British flag, had been employed on these rivers, the firm of Lynch resolved to place commercial steamers on the run. Before doing so, they approached the Foreign Office and received the following despatch from the British Government :— Gentlemen, February 17, I860. I am directed by Lord John Russell to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9 th February, enquiring whether an English company has a right to navigate the waters between Mohammerah, Basra, and Bagdad, and I am to acquaint you in reply that in the year 1846 it was agreed with the Porte that British vessels, qualified to navigate as such, should be allowed to pass up and down the Riveis Tigris and Euphrates under their own flag, paying for the merchandise on board according to the Treaty of Balta-liman, and staying to carry on the internal traffic at their pleasure ; that British owned boats or vessels built in the country and employed in the internal trade should pay duty on the same terms, but should not be allowed to carry the national colours; and that an anchorage duty of five Turkish piastres should be paid on each vessel which passed up those rivers beyond the port of entry. Lord John Russell has no further information as to how the case stands with regard to the Persian Port of Mohammerah.” I am, &amp;c. G. Hammond. It will be observed that no mention is made in this despatch of any restrictions on the operations of the company. In the year 1874 the Turkish Government also placed steamers on the river. From that date to the present time, the service on the rivers has been conducted by the British and the Turkish line of steamers to the exclusion of any other party. At the present date the traffic is almost equally divided between the British and Turkish line, the British line having the larger share. Reference to the correspondence (No. 1 , p. 34), will show the exact proportions, while a reference to pp. 50 and 51 of the same correspondence will show the way in which the British company have been able to expand in spite of the restrictions sought to be imposed upon their operations by the Turkish Government.8 Sir Edward Grey denies, in answer to the third question, that the British company,, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, entered into negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1909 with a view to the formation of a new 1 urkish company, under its management, to take over the Turkish Government steamers. Not only is this denial unwarranted, hut the fact is that pressure was brought to bear upon the British company by the Foreign Office to enter into negotiations. And, in answer to ) the fourth question, he states that the subsequent negotiations in 1909, for the fusion of the British and Turkish companies, were entered into by Mr. Lynch without the knowledge of the Foreign Office, who, in that year, first obtained information on the subject from Sir G. Mackenzie. This answer can only be correct on the supposition that the Foreign Office were not informed by the British Embassy in Constantinople of the important change in the form of the negotiations which had taken place at Constantinople with the approval and support of the British Embassy in the spring of 1909. It is, however, certain that the change in form was submitted by the British Embassy to the Foreign Office and it is only a question of the date, this is made clear by the following statement by Colonel Picot, director of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, made in July 1910, and by the following memorandum of interview between Lord Hardinge and Colonel Picot in September 1910 :— Statement by Colonel Picot. July 29, 1912. I have often discussed with Sir Charles Hardinge the advisability of preventing the Turkish company falling into German hands, but these conversations were always of a general character. The actual origin, however, of the present negotiations, so far as my memory goes, was an interview with Sir Charles Hardinge, when he stated that if we were not prepared to negotiate with the Turkish Government for the management of the Turkish steamers, others were ready to do so, and he specially mentioned Sir George Mackenzie, who, he stated, was ready to undertake these negotiations in his own interests. He considered that we were in the best position to bring about the desired result, and stated that Sir George Mackenzie would be ready to stand on one side if we would commence negotiations. It was a clear invitation to negotiate, accompanied by a warning that if we did not do so then, the support of the Foreign Office would be transferred to Sir George Mackenzie. It must be noted that the Germans were supposed to be doing their utmost to obtain a footing on the river. No negotiations were undertaken at any time at Constantinople or through other channels without the full knowledge of the Embassy and the Foreign Office. They were conducted by me on behalf of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, and no separate negotiations were conducted by the firm of Lynch Brothers. We have had no negotiations with the Turkish Government without the knowledge and support of the Embassy and the Foreign Office at every stage. Letter and memorandum by Colonel Picot, 22 nd September, 1910 :— Dear Lynch, I now send on a report of my interview with Lord Hardinge. Yours sincerely, H. Picot. Memorandum of Interview between Lord Hardinge of Penshurst and Lieutenant- Colonel Picot at the Foreign Office, on September 20, 1910.) I had written to Lord Hardinge to say that I would like to see him on a matter personal to myself. I opened the interview by saying that the matter personal to myself concerned recent correspondence which had passed between the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and the Foreign Office on the subject of the fusion pioject. In one of the letters of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company—letter of the 22 nd July, 1910—mention was made that “ the fusion project was formed at-the instance of the Foreign Office for the purpose of preventing the extension of German influence.” The Foreign Office, in reply, had stated that “ they had had no knowledge of the fusion project till it was brought to their knowledge by others. 1 had added that I was responsible for the accuracy of this statement, and had therefore come to see him on the subject. Lord Hardinge said, “ but you were wrong. Ihe ‘ fusion ’ project did not come from us.”I replied that the actual form of the project was a matter of detail. The Foreign Office had for a long time past brought pressure to bear on the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to induce them to take action in Constantinople with a view to obtaining control over the Turkish service in order to stave off similar action on the part of German interests. I continued, “You informed me personally that if the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company failed to use their opportunities others were ready to do so; that you would not let the opportunity go by; that Sir G. Mackenzie was ready to take our place and to open negotiations in Constantinople in the sense desired, and that failing us the Foreign Office would give him their support. These conversations were meant to be conveyed to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, and I had so conveyed them. The result was that in the spring of 1909 I was asked by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to proceed to Constantinople to ascertain whether the Turks were ready to negotiate, and on what basis.” I at once called on you and you asked me, “ Is Sir George Mackenzie with you ? ” and, on my replying in the affirmative, you expressed yourself as perfectly satisfied. Lord Hardinge replied that this was so. I went on to say that as regards the actual form of the project, neither I nor anyone else could have had any knowledge of the form likely to appeal to the Turkish Government before consulting the officials at Constantinople :— “ It was after reaching Constantinople that I found that control could only be obtained by ‘ fusion ’ of the British and Turkish river services. The Ambassador was kept informed and I ascertained from him that a ‘ fusion ’ on the lines suggested by the Turkish officials was consonant with the views of the Foreign Office.” “I returned from Constantinople in the spring of 1909. I at once called on you and was informed by you that the Foreign Office had at first some doubts as to the advisability of supporting the ‘ fusion ’ project, in that it would necessitate a change of flag, but that they had, on your representations, decided to support it provided that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company obtained control of the combined companies.” Lord Hardinge assented to this statement. I added that, when negotiations were reopened in the autumn of 1909, 1 had again the fullest support of the Foreign Office. I then said, “ What I now understand is that the Foreign Office, when replying to the letter of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company of the 22 nd July, 1910, refers to the particular form of the negotiations that ot ‘ fusion.’ They wish to say that the form did not emanate from them, and they do not deny that the negotiations were opened originally at their express instance.” Lord Hardinge replied that the Foreign Office letter referred to the form of the negotiations. This finished the conversation on this subject. H. PlCOT. Sir Edward Grey proceeds to state, in answer to the same question, that Sir G. Mackenzie had been negotiating, with the approval and support of His Majesty’s Government, since the year 1901 for control over the Turkish line of steamers; but that in June 1909, he agreed to withdraw for the time from competition. The facts are that Sir G. Mackenzie often corresponded with the Foreign Office on the subject of the Tigris navigation. But he was in the habit of sending copies of his correspondence to Mr. Lynch, and he always assured Mr. Lynch that these overtures of his were really made to promote the interests of the British company, of which Mr. Lynch is chairman, and not with a view to competition. The following extract from a letter written by Sir G. Mackenzie to Mr. Lynch on the 26th April, 1907, illustrates the character of the negotiations conducted by Sir G. Mackenzie with the Foreign Office from time to time. My dear Lynch, April 26, 190/. ^ # # * # * * The matter is now at a point where I consider it desirable that you should be acquainted of what has passed, in order that a decision may be taken as to the best means of opening formal negotiations with a view to bringing them to a succesful issue. [1825 1] D10 Enclosed is a file of the correspondence that has passed between Sir C. Hardmge myself, and Mr. . If after you have read it you will name a day and hour I shall be happy to meet wherever most convenient to you and gne you ail further details you may desire. . Yours sincerely, George S. Mackenzie. p Again, on the 19th December, 1907, Sir G. Mackenzie writes to Mr. Lynch’s colleaooie. Colonel Picot, as follows :— “I feel sure that a way can be found of working the Turks to the advantage of the Euphrates and Tigris Steamship Navigation Company and of effectually preventing the Turkish steamers from falling into other hands, and this I would advocate as the wisest course. You will never run them off, nor will they sell themselves to you. Co-operate with them, and show them that a co-operation means strength ]and profit to themselves, and you will eventually obtain the financial control.” On the 24th December, 1907, Colonel Picot thus describes Sir^ G. Mackenzie’s attitude in a letter to Mr. Lynch, written the day after an interview with Sir G. Mackenzie :— “ He repeated what he has so often said, that he has no intention of taking our place, and only desires to see our possible competitors in Mesopotamia kept away from the river.” There was an honourable understanding between Sir G. Mackenzie’s firm and Messrs. Lynch that Messrs. Lynch should not compete in the ocean traffic and Sir G. Mackenzie’s firm should not compete in the river traffic. Sir Edward Grey proceeds to state, in further answer to the fourth question, that Sir G. Mackenzie induced the other British firms in Mesopotamia to withdraw from active opposition to the Lynch “ fusion scheme.” But Messrs. Lynch personally approached practically all these British firms, explained to them the nature of the scheme, and obtained from them the following document, which was duly forwarded to the Foreign Office. It is quite true that Sir G. Mackenzie’s firm presented the document. The reason for this is obvious. It would come better from one of the firms concerned than from Messrs. Lynch themselves. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office. 23, Great Winchester Street, _ _ London, March 10, 1910. M ith reference to the negotiations which we understand are in progress with the Turkish Government for the fusion ot the British steamship company on the Tigris with the steamers of the Turkish Government, we have the honour to state, on behalf of the British commercial interests in Turkish Arabia and the Persian Gulf, which we repre sent, that in^our opinion this fusion would benefit British and Indian trade with these regions, v cuild provide for the development of this trade, and would prevent the present line of Turkish steamers from falling into hands which might not be friendly to British trade. \\ e ha e received assurances from the British company, who, we understand, are to be the principal British shareholders, that the convention for bringing about the fusion contains provisions safeguarding shippers from any preferential treatment being meted out to individual^ shippers or firms, and also fixes a maximum tariff assuring reasonable charges for river transport. We have, &amp;c. Gray, Dawes, and Co. For the Ellerman Lines (Limited): - *L L. Ellermam, Chairman. For the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) : C. Green way. Managing Director. For the British India Steam Navigation Company (Limited) : James J. Mack ay. Director. P. W. Armour, Secretary.For the Imperial Bank of Persia: G. IS ewell, Manager. For Frank C. Strick and Co. : Frank C. Strick, Managing Director. For David Sassoon and Co. (Limited): Cecil J. Longcroft, Manager. T. S. Blockey and Co. For the Bucknall Steamship Lines (Limited): Edward Lloyd, General Manager. For the Basra Trading Company (Limited) : Hugh J. Tweedy, Director. Sir E. Grey’s answer to the fifth and sixth questions would seem to infer that, in spite of the resolution of the Ottoman Chamber, authorising the Turkish Government to consider the concession with Messrs. Lynch, the scheme broke down because it involved financial liability upon the Turkish Treasury, which the Besolution had excluded. This is incorrect. Subsequent to the resolution of the Chamber, Messrs. Lynch had agreed to strike out the objectionable clause. Sir E. Grey proceeds to speak of opposition in the Turkish Chamber. But that Chamber, after two days’ debate, during which every aspect of the scheme had been thoroughly discussed, passed the resolution to grant the concession to Messrs. Lynch by 168 votes to 8 votes. That the Foreign Office did not regard the scheme as one that had fallen through, but only as one that was in abeyance is shown by the following memorandum of an interview between Colonel Picot and Mr. Maxwell at the Foreign Office in May, 1911 :— Junior United Service Club, London, My dear Lynch, May 10, 1911. I saw Maxwell yesterday. I said that in the event of political changes in Constan tinople, leading to a return towards the liberal tendencies of Hilmi Pacha, and therefore towards that official’s views as regards the Fusion scheme, we wished to know whether we should have Foreign Office support as before. Maxwell replied that in his opinion, we certainly should have that support, but that, I would of course understand, he could only express his own personal opinion. He could not speak for Sir E. Grey. He personally understood the Ambassador, when he gave Mr. Whittall to under stand that the fusion scheme was dead and buried, to mean that under the present circumstances of the political situation it was for all practical purposes dead and buried, not that it was dead and buried for good and all under all circumstances. Maxwell said the Foreign Office wofild keep the question alive. Yours sincerely, H. Picot. Taken as a whole, Sir E. Grey’s answer is so incorrect and misleading that one can only suppose that he has been gravely misinformed. The documents produced above only constitute a part of the evidence, being the result of a first scrutiny of the files. It may now be desirable to present a summary of the various negotiations which, with the full approval aud support of their Government, the British company have conducted at Constantinople of recent years for the revival under their control of the Turkish line of steamers on the Tigris. (No. 3 .)—Brief Narrative of Events leading up to the Negotiations between the British Foreign Office and Hakhi Pasha in 1913. The origin of the British Steamship Company on the rivers of Mesopotamia and the present position on those rivers has been described on page 7 above. It has for many years past been recognised that there was a distinct danger lest the Turkish line of steamers might fall under European financial control, in which case it might go hardly with the British company, whose powers of expansion the durkish Government had always sought to restrict. The Directors of the British company have therefore expended an immense amount of effort in endeavouring to prevent such a result. As long ago as the year 1887, the late Mr. T. K. Lynch visited Constantinopole with a view12 to the financial reorganisation of the Turkish steamers in the form of a new Turkish company under British control. His proposals received the rull approval and support- of the British Ambassador, the late Sir W. White. The statutes of the proposed new company were favourably reported on by the cf conseil legiste , and the scheme would have received the Imperial sanction had it not been for the opposition^ of Minister of Marine, a very powerful official to whose department the i emittances (b from the steamers were at that date paid. At a date subsequent to 188/, the Turkish steamers were transferred from the Ministry of Marine to the Sultans Civil List; and they remained in this department until the year 1909, when they were handed over, upon the advent of constitutional Government, to the Ministries of Public Works and Finance. The Sultan Abdul Hamid was extremely jealous of the introduction of British capital into the countries bordering upon the Persian Gulf. Until tne closing years of his reign proposals of this nature were doomed to failure. Though he gave little attention to the Turkish steamer on the Tigris, he added, during comparatively recent years, two new units to the Turkish fleet, which up to that time, had consisted of the steamers originally brought out by Midhat Pasha. These vessels were named respec tively “ Burhanieh ” and “ Hamidieh,” and'proposals were on foot in the spring of 1907 for the purchase, through Messrs. Armstrong, of four new vessels. The British company, were therefore confronted in the spring of 1907 with the danger of being driven off the rivers by large increases in the Turkish fleet. Under these circumstances the British company approached the British Foreign Office with a view to the removal of the restrictions sought to be placed by the Turkish Government upon their operations. The British Foreign Office responded to these overtures by sending instructions to the British Embassy in Constantinople to the effect that “ His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate any unfair attempts to drive the British service off the river ” ; and in conveying this news to the directors of the British company, the Foreign Office stated : — “ It is certainly the wish of His Majesty’s Government that the British service on the river should be maintained and strengthened.” In a further letter on the same subject the Foreign Office wrote :— “You can certainly rely on the earnest desire of His Majesty’s Government to maintain and strengthen British steamers on the river.” As a result of pressure brought by the British Embassy upon the Turkish Govern ment, permission was given by the Turkish Government to the British company to run an additional steamer. That was in March 1907. Subsequently to this, it was arranged with the Turkish Government that each of the three steamers which the British company employed should be entitled to tow steel barges, thus, considerably adding to the space at their disposal. It was arranged that the additional steamer should fly the Turkish Hag when engaged on her voyages and the British flag when in port. This assertion by the British Foreign Office nf a vigorous interest in the British steamers produced a marked effect upon the Sultan Abdul Hamid. At an interview accorded to him by the British Foreign Office on the 14t.h February, 1907, when the negotiations for the additional steamer were in progress, Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, chairman of the British company, was informed that the Sultan had remarked to the British Ambassador that he hoped the British company and the Turkish Steamers Administra tion would co-operate in the future. The British company had sent one of their directors, Colonel Picot, to Constantinople in connection with the negotiations; and he was instructed to make full use of the Sultan’s remark and to endeavour to open up nego lations with the Minister of the Civil List with a view 7 to giving effect to His Majesty s remark. It became evident Hat concrete proposals for a fusion of interests we J 1 e P rei 1 n J ture - Colonel Picot succeeded in establishing excellent relations with the Civil List and with the Turkish Government, of which the British Government has now reaped the fruit. The Minister of the Civil List informed Colonel Picot that ne yncn Company could always rely on his support. He added the following illustration of his attitude :— We are at table. You have three dishes and I have seven. You want to reach across anc ea o my seven dishes. I have no objection to your doing so : but, when I want to reach across and eat of your three dishes, you object. Now, if you eat of mine you should let me eat of yours, and we shall be all the better friends.” Thus the door was left open for future negotiations.Colonel Picot returned to England in the spring of 1907. He then discovered that Sir G. Mackenzie had been conferring, during his absence, with Sir C. Hardinge, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, with a view to the granting of a loan to the Turkish Government in return for some form of control over the Turkish steamers. Colonel Picot expressed surprise that the Ambassador in Constantinople had ''Anot mentioned these negotiations to him. Under these circumstances Mr. Lynch addressed the following letter to Sir G. Mackenzie :— My dear Mackenzie, House of Commons, May 9, 1907. Many thanks for yours of yesterday. I do not think you can have quite under stood Picot. I accepted the condition on which the third steamer is running on the assurance of the Grand Vizier, signified to me through the Foreign Office, that they w T ere designed to prevent other Powe'rs from coming in; and on the understanding that the Sultan’s own words in granting permission to the third steamer, namely, that this should lead to co-operation between the two services, the Turkish and the British, should be given practical application. I at once set to work to bring about this co-operation, and I am indifferent as to the particular method of attaining it. In this we must consult the wishes of the Sultan. I think the Turks are scarcely likely to consent to sell their concern right out and abandon all say in it. I can assure you that your views have been carefully noted. I hope, as you kindly suggest, you may see your way to leaving matters in our hands, for, if two are to be moving in the matter over here, with the Foreign Office or at Constantinople, the matter itself will greatly suffer. Should we require your further advice or assistance, perhaps you will allow me to communicate with you. I am asking Mr. Allan Ilamsay to see you and explain to you the situation at Constantinople, whence he has just arrived. Believe me, &amp;c. H. F. B. Lynch. Sir G. Mackenzie then placed his whole correspondence with the Foreign Office at Mr. Lynch’s disposal, and left the matter.in his hands. It was decided that the first favourable opportunity should be taken to approach the Civil List. On the 9 th April, 1907, Colonel Picot had informed the Foreign Office that the British Ambassador in Constantinople, Sir Nicholas O’Conor, had suggested to him that the time had come for approaching the Civil List with a view to obtaining some control over the service. Following upon an interview with Sir Charles Hardinge, Permanent Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Allan ftamsay, who had a long experience of commercial affairs in Turkey, was entrusted by the board of the British company with a mission to Constantinople. The object of his mission was defined to be the formation of an Ottoman company, to be financed by British capital and with exclusive rights of navigation, subject to the rights of the British company. I his new Ottoman company would absorb the existing Turkish steamers, and it would be arranged that a proportion of the net profits should be paid to the Civil List. Alternatively, Mr. Ramsay would propose to the Turkish Government to work the Turkish steameis on a commission basis, in harmony with the existing British steamers. Nothing decisive came out of Mr. Allan Ramsay’s mission ; and in the autumn of the same year Colonel Picot again proceeded to Constantinople, arriving there on the 30th September. ^He was engaged in the realisation of what he described as “ the Ambassador’s scheme for absorbing the Turkish river service.” The first question which arose was by whom this could best be effected. Outside parties, such as Sir G. Mackenzie and his friends, could never secure the reorganised Turkish river service against competition by the British service. But opinions differed among British circles in Constantinople as to whether a direct repre sentative of the British company, like Colonel Picot, or someone in a neutral position, acting on its behalf, would be best calculated to attain the end in view. The first course was recommended by one of the greatest British commercial expeits in Constantinople, who held that the direct appearance of the British company as promoters of the scheme would not prejudice the negotiations in any way. I he Ambassador, however, favoured the latter course; and, in the absence of Mr. Allan Ramsay, Mr. Edwin Whittall, a prominent merchant of Constantinople, accepted to act in the desired capacity. From that time on Mr. Whittall conducted the negotiations with the assistance of Colonel Picot. Colonel Picot, however, personally visited the Minister of the Civil List on the 6 th October, and “ was greatly pleased at the way in which he received my mention of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company [1825 f—1] E14 and of your name (Mr. Lynch’s), and I gather from what he said that our relations have greatly changed for the better.” . j x l ^ Tentative approaches were then made through an independent party. The position of the Civil List was ascertained to be as follows : “ As regards offers made by private parties for the purchase of the line with the/p intention of turning it into an Ottoman company, such offers were made some years ago by Turkish subjects in Constantinople and were reported to hi is Majesty the bultan. His Majesty rejected these proposals and said that this line of steamers should never he merged into a company, and that he would have no tampering wit i it o any kind. Since that date no proposals of a similar nature have been placed be lore the Sultan by the Palace.” Colonel Picot returned to London in November in order to confer afresh with the Foreign Office and with his colleagues. Mr. Lynch had, ^ in the meanwhile, been travelling in Macedonia where he had been in close touch with the Turkish inspector- general, Hilmi Pasha. . . In December 1907 Colonel Picot saw Sir C. Hardmge at the Toreign Office Sir Charles informed him of a proposed loan to the Turkish Government by banks in Constantinople, the revenues of the Turkish river service on the Tigris to be included in the securities. It transpired that correspondence had taken place upon the subject between the Ambassador, the Foreign Office, and Sir G. Mackenzie. Colonel Picot expressed surprise that the Ambassador had said nothing to him on the subject. Sir C. Hardinge then defined the attitude of the Foreign Office as follows :— The Foreign Office did not desire to create a competitive service on the Tigris; but they had been in correspondence with Sir G. Mackenzie, and they would be glad if the two parties could join hands in the negotiations for the Turkish service. Colonel Picot then approached Sir G. Mackenzie, who informed him that the loan proposals appeared to him to be vague and unsatisfactory. He reaffirmed his desire to be of any assistance, but emphasised that he had “ simply acted so as to keep the door open.” On the 27th January, 1908, Colonel Picot again visited the Foreign Office. The following letter gives the account of his interview :— Junior United Service Club, London, My dear Lynch, January 27, 1908. Upon my arrival home I found a letter from Mr. Maxwell asking me to see Sir C. Hardinge as soon as possible. I called at the Foreign Office to-day and saw Messrs. Maxwell and Mallet. They tell me that the negotiations of the banks have failed, and that the Bank has withdrawn from the discussion of loans to the Civil List. Sir G. Mackenzie has practically done the same. The Foreign Office suggested that I should go to Constantinople and enter into direct relations with the Civil List. The Foreign Office and the Ambassador will give me their full support. Yours sincerely, H. Picot. Domestic matters rendered it extremely difficult for Colonel Picot to leave England at that time. However, his colleagues urged him to defer to the wishes of the Foreign Office, and he left England on the 15th February, arriving in Constantinople a few days later. He went provided with various alternative schemes for a loan to the Turkish Government on the security of the revenues of the Turkish steamers. Upon arrival, however, he discovered that the Ambassador’s negotiations' were based on a “surveillance” of the Turkish Steamer Administration in case of default; that this “surveillance” was of very little value^and that even this shadowy form of control had been rejected by the Sultan. Colonel Picot, therefore, addressed himself to drawing closer the relations between the British company and the Turkish Steamer Administration by means of an agreement for joint rates. The Minister of the Civil List informed Colonel Picot that the time was not yet ripe for anything more than this, though he did not close the door upon larger negotiations in the future. The Ambassador, Sir Nicholas O’Conor, died at his post in the month of March. Colonel Picot quitted Constantinople in April, leaving Mr. E. Whittall in charge of the interests of the British company.Not long afterwards the revolution broke out in Turkey. On the 22 nd October, 1908, Colonel Picot visited the Foreign Office and saw Sir C. Hardinge. The latter then for the first time mentioned the possibility that the British company, in order to arrive at an amalgamation of interests, might have to drop the British flag. He urged watchfulness at Constantinople, and observed that the Civil List might now be in need of money. In November the British company got out a scheme for the control of the Turkish steamers; but it was not until the month of February, 1909, that it became possible to approach the Civil List. On the 9th of that month Mr. Whittall reported that the Minister of the Civil List had at last made up his mind to transfer the Turkish steamers to a private company, and was prepared to entertain offers. Colonel Picot had already arrived in Constantinople with a view to giving effect to Sir C. Hardinge’s wishes. Mr. Lynch saw Sir G. Mackenzie in London, and was able to telegraph to Colonel Picot that Sir George, while desiring participation, fully concurred that a preponderating share in the proposed new Ottoman company should be acquired by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Sir G. Lowther had now succeeded Sir N. O’Conor as Ambassador. Colonel Picot came home at the end of the month to confer with his colleagues, returning to Constantinople on the 16th March, 1909. He took with him the drafts of alternative schemes for the purpose of creating a new Ottoman company under British control to operate side by side with the British company. The following extract from the instructions which he received from his Board will make the position clear :— &lt;e The Civil List desires a community of interests between the proposed new Turkish company and the British company. This can be brought about in several ways .... You will not fail to make it clear that, owing to this unity of management and unity of control the very best financial results for the enterprise as a whole will be secured. We are certainly in a far better position than any other party to offer terms to the Civil List for the formation of an Ottoman company. You may, therefore, decide that it would be wiser not to allow the question of the flag on the present British steamers to be raised at all. No other party could offer the Turks to have the British flag withdrawn, and, therefore, why should we ?” It was found, however, that the Civil List would not be likely to entertain proposals for the control of their steamers by British capitalists while the British steamers remained outside. A fusion, embracing both lines in a single Ottoman company under British control, seemed the only practicable method of approach in the view' of those on the spot. This change of attitude was due to fear qf criticism in the Turkish Parliament on the part of the Civil List. The position of the Sultan was at this time precarious ; he might be deposed at any moment. His Majesty was anxious to get the scheme through in the interests of his family. The Ambassador, Sir G. Lowther was at once consulted, and gave his approval and full support to the fusion scheme, though it involved the disappearance of the British flag. On the 1 st April, 1909, Colonel Picot was authorised by telegraph to sign the necessary contract, subject to the approval of the British Ambassador. The Grand Vizier, Hilmi Pasha, had already given the scheme his blessing. But certain important features required revision, and it was necessary for Mr. H. F. B. Lynch to join his colleague, Colonel Picot, in Constantinople, in order to confer with him and with Mr. E. Whittall. Accordingly Mr. Lynch left London on the 9 th April, 1909, arriving on the Bosphorous on the morning of the 13th. Before the train had reached the walls of the imperial city, after crossing the lonesome deserts of Thrace, news was brought that a revolution had broken out in the capital, and that blood was being spilled. This was confirmed at the terminus. The Young Turk leaders were said to be flying in all directions. It was afterwards ascertained that one of the most prominent among them was hiding among the rafters of the railway station that very morning, As the carriage crossed the wooden bridge on its way to Pera, the stains of blood could be seen on the roadway. Groups of soldiers without officers were met in the streets, and volleys were being fired, apparently for the pleasure of making a noise. Messrs. Picot and Whittall were awaiting Mr. Lynch in a room at the club house; and the remainder of the day of the 13th was devoted to the drafting of the convention, though the incessant firing in the streets rendered the task somewhat difficult. This work occupied the whole of the two days following. Nothing then remained to be done but to obtain the Imperial sanction. Meanwhile, the Salonica troops were approaching the city, bent on restoring the Young Turk regime. The Sultan was inaccessible. Some said that he had abdicated ; others that he had escaped on a Bussian vessel. In the capital Nazim Pasha was maintaining order, as best he16 could; but the lives of Europeans were in danger on more than one occasion. T e Parliament had transferred itself to San Stefano, and day by day troops were collecting in greater numbers outside the city, waiting for the word to measure their strength with that at the disposal of Abdul Hamid. The tussle came on the morning o t e 24th April, and before noon the Sultan was practically a prisoner m his palace at Yildiz, which was closely invested by the Parliamentary troops. _ On the 2 /th the boom of guns announced the accession of a new Sultan. Abdul Hamid had been dethroned and his brother reigned in his stead. . • i tj-i • u While these events were in progress Mr. Lynch was conferring with Hilmi ir^asha at a house which the ex-Grand ’Vizier wms occupying on the road to Yildiz. The steamer question on the Tigris was discussed in all its bearings from the i urkish point of view. Early in May 1909 Hilmi was invested with the Grand Viziership, and the Turkish Steamer Administration on the Tigris was transferred from the Civil List to the Ministry of Finance. From that time on the Council of Ministers dealt with the nego tiations, which were protracted into the autumn and winter. It is no exaggeration to say that more troublesome negotiations have rarely taken place. ^ Collectively, the Ministers mistrusted the ground upon which they stood; individually, they were influenced by conflicting considerations, both of domestic and of foreign policy. The Constitution was new; parliamentary government in its infancy ; it was doubtful whether this convention for the navigation of their two greatest rivers would have to be brought before the Chamber. Clause after clause was discussed with the greatest minuteness and care. Sheafs of telegrams passed between the head office of the British company in London and their negotiators in Constantinople. Mr. Lynch was obliged to return to England at the end of May ; his colleague, Colonel Picot, remained at the post of difficulty, where he received the invaluable assistance and co-operation of Mr. E. Whittall. The principle of British control over the proposed new company was never abandoned; but concessions of the largest order, compatible with the maintenance of this principle, were made and there emerged a measure for the creation of a single highly efficient service of steamers on the rivers, enjoying the economies due to unity of administration and of control, endowed with powers to improve the conditions of the navigation, and to extend it to the courses of the Upper Tigris and of the Euphrates, and debarred by ample safeguards from charging excessive rates of freight. In this form the Council of Ministers were prepared to accept the measure and the statutes and “ cahier des charges ” were duly got out. But German diplomacy had regarded the conclusion of such an arrangement with none too friendly an eye. A press campaign in the capital w T as set loose upon it, and local opposition, at Bagdad and Basra, was stirred up In December 1909 the negotia tions entered a perilous stage, and this stage unfortunately coincided with the imminence of a general election in England, which would require Mr. Lynch to abandon the direction of the affair from London and to proceed to his constituency in Yorkshire. Under these circumstances Mr. Lynch had already approached the chief whip, asking him to find another candidate. He received the following reply :— My dear Lynch, Headlam Hall, Gainford, November 22, 1909. The only chance of our retaining the seat you hold is for you to come into the division and work yourself. If you do this, I am assured you will be again returned, but if you retired, no one else would wm it. I will see Grey and get an undertaking from him that your business interests now under negotiation shall not be prejudiced by your absence from London whilst you are electioneering, and I hope you can begin your campaign at once. Yours sincerely, Joseph A. Pease. The idea was that the Iqreign Office should ask the Turkish Government to allow moie time for replies to their questions if, indeed, the discussions could not on this occasion be postponed for a week or two. The Turkish Government had frequently adopted this course themselves. But Mr. Pease’s efforts were quite fruitless and were only productive of delay m going down to the constituency, which Mr. Lynch agreed to do rather than rum the prospects of his party. Largely owing to this delay, the seat low,uds the middle of December 1909, while the General Election in England was m full swing, the convention was dragged before the Turkish Chamber by the opponents of the Government. A debate, lasting two days, took place, during which le mis rj, was a some moments in danger. At length the following resolution was proposed and carried by 168 votes to 8 votes : *“ The Chamber recognises the right of the Government to grant concessions which do not entail financial obligations upon the State, until such time as a law shall have been passed specially dealing with the subject of concessions. As regards the question of the Lynch Company, if that company should accept the conditions laid down by the Government, the Government is empowered to grant the concession to the Lynch Company, since the concession does not involve financial obligations. The Chamber expresses its complete confidence in the Cabinet and passes to the order of the day.” The British company forthwith placed itself in accord with the requirements of the Government, and requested that the resolution should be carried out and the transaction completed. But a short time afterwards Hilmi Pasha fell from power, being succeeded by Hakki Pasha, who was credited with German leanings. Hakki Pasha shelved the matter, and the pressure brought to bear by the British Foreign Office proved ineffectual. It remained, therefore, a scheme in abeyance, awaiting a favourable opportunity in order to be placed into execution (see page 11 above). German diplomacy obtained the ascendency in Constantinople. In September 1911 the war with Italy broke out, and this war was immediately followed by that in the Balkans. The defeat of Turkey by the Balkan States completely changed the situation. The Turkish Government was obliged to borrow large sums of money, and it became necessary to obtain the consent of the Powers to an increase in the customs duties. This provided the opportunity for which British diplomacy had been looking. The mission of Hakki Pasha to this country in the spring of the present year (1913) enabled the British Government to revive the question. In the meanwhile, rapid progress had been made with the construction of the Bagdad Kailway. The Germans had renounced that part of the Bagdad Kailway Concession which enabled them to continue the line from Bagdad to Basra and the Persian Gulf, in return for permission to construct a commercial port at Alexandretta, and to connect that station on the Mediterranean with their trunk line. During the reign of Abdul Hamid they had in vain sought to obtain this privilege; his successor proved more pliable, or was more wise. Gangs of men were set to work on the Taurus section on the west of the Mesopotamian Plain. Material was poured in from the sea board of Syria. But it was resolved to hasten the completion of the railway by simultaneous construction from the side of Bagdad. The rails would be shipped from Germany to the Persian Gulf and conveyed by river from the gulf to the city of the Caliphs. The Germans had been empowered under the Bagdad Kailway Concession to place a fleet of steamers upon the Euphrates and Tigris for the purpose of transporting the railway material. Article 9 of that concession reads as follows :— “ Les materiaux de construction et autres necessaires pour la construction et Texploitation de cette ligne et de ses embranchements, ainsi que les agents et ouvriers, seront transportes, seulement pendant la duree de la construction et sous la surveillance du Ministere de la Marine, sur le Chatt-el-Arab, le Tigre et TEuphrate, avec des navires it vapeur ou a voiles ou autres embarcations qui seront procurees ou louees par la socffitd. “ Ce matdriel de transport jouira de fexemption de droits de douane, impots et autres.” The prospect of the advent of this fleet of German-owned steamers was one which deserved the attention of the directors of the British company. The steamers at their own disposal were too few to cope with this cargo, and the Turkish line was scarcely able to deal with the existing traffic. Pourparlers were opened up with the Bagdad Kailway Company. The task of arriving at an agreement was not exactly easy. The German Hamburg—Amerika Linie had instituted a regular service to the Persian Gulf, and its German agents in those regions were, quite naturally, anxious to secure a business of this nature. However, in the autumn of 1912 a complete accord was established. England and Germany joined hands in their first common enterprise in these countries. A new company was founded in Brussels, entitled the Societe des Transports fluviaux en Orient. Half the capital was allotted to the British company on the Tigris and half to the Deutsche Bank. These two bodies became equal partners in the enterprise, and it was provided that a third share should be held at the disposal of the Turkish Government, should it desire to join the combination, when freed from the preoccupations of the Italian war. A most important provision was one to the effect that the scope of the company’s operations could not be extended beyond the carriage of rail wav' material except with the consent of both bodies, the British and [1825 £—1] F18 i the German, as weil as °i the Turhish Governing oom _ Mesgrs . L | no h Brothers. concern was entrusted to the agen s ° s hinvards the barges in those of Germany, The steamers were constructed in “ Py a ™^ t \ he “f ete success on the Tigris. and this fleet are at present (August I •’l-’,) V'J J , , , were submitted The various conventions constituting the Soc.4te, as well as its statutes, were submitted to the British Foreign Office some time before its formation. . . ^ 4 The formation ff this Anglo-German Company, for the article 9 of the Bagdad Railway Convention, was Xes e Jra^eZ' The advantage to England of an equal voice in what, but for these arrangements, would have bleu a purely German or Turco-German concern was It was suggested that there was some secret arrangement m the b ^ r °^ n f’ h an ^ ^ the British company had sold themselves to the Germans. With r . £ plausibility it might have been contended that the Germans had sold thmr rights under article 9 of the Bagdad concession to the British company As a matter of fact there was no arrangement of any kind, secret or otherwise, outside the arrangements governing the formation of the new company. The British company remained as free after the conclusion of the transaction as it had been free before the Geimans a been heard of in these regions. And, when proposals were made by the Turkish Government in the spring of the present year (1913) to enlarge the Societe into an Ang o-German- Turkish company, with powers to absorb the existing enterprises on tne ligris and to deal with all categories of river transport, the British company at once transmitted the proposals to the British Foreign Office, assuring the Foreign Office that they would take no step in this direction without the consent and full approval of His Majesty s Government. In a despatch dated the 11 th April, 1913, the company described to the Foreign Office the situation on the Tigris, so far as it concerned the Geimans, undei the metaphor of a clean slate. The slate was clean, and it remained foi His Majesty s Government to write what they might think best upon the slate. Little did the directors of the British company suspect at that time that the Foreign Office had already decided—as subsequent events seem to show—to hand them over to the tender mercies of a complete stranger to the navigation. (No. 4 .)—The Negotiations of 1913. What was actually written on the slate by the Foreign Office, with the assistance of the Board of Trade, is fully described by the correspondence contained in Print No. 1 . At the commencement of May these Departments sent for the chairman of the British company and asked for information. They appeared not to have made up their minds about the matter, except that they did not desire any German participation in the development of the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris. They seemed indifferent as to whether the British flag remained or should be withdrawn, preferring on the whole the former course. What they wanted were all the facts and all the particulars to enable them to create a new Ottoman company, while Hakki Pasha remained in this country. There was, of course, the Convention of 1909, which had been negotiated with so much thoroughness by the chairman of the British company, in daily touch with the Council of Ministers in Constantinople. But certain modifi cations would be required if the British steamers were left out, and the figures upon which the purchase of the fleet and properties of the Turkish Administration were based would have to be revised and brought up to date. In the light of subsequent occurrences, it may here be asked why the directors of the British company did not at the outset make it perfectly clear that they co-operated in the task of creating the company, whether with or without the British steamers, on the distinct understanding that the control of it should be place in their hands. The answer to this question is a two-fold one. In the first place the policy of the Foreign Office had never lain on the side of a competitive service on the rivers (see above, p. 14), and year after year they had been supporting the British company in obtaining control over the Turkish steamers, recognising that the rights of the British company to expansion could be satisfied in that manner with least resistance on the part of the Turkish Government. It seemed quite unnecessary to suggest that this policy might be reversed, and the whole attitude of the departmental officials precluded the supposition that others were in the field. Secondly, the chairman of the company, at the very outset of the negotiations, did take such precautions against untoward surprises as seemed consonant with respect for the dignity of Government departments. But these precautions wereonly taken in consequence of what had occurred on a previous occasion, where, however, the circumstances were scarcely analogous. In the present case there seemed no reason to suppose the existence of competitive factors in the background, and the loyalty displayed by the company towards the Foreign Office in the matter of the Turco- German proposals negatived the idea that its directors could have rendered themselves ^suspect of disposing of their interests to Germany. The nature of the precautions taken is indicated on p. 8 of Print No. 1 , and in the following extract from a letter addressed by Mr. H. F. B. Lynch to Mr. Maxwell of the Foreign Office as early as November, 1912 :— Dear Mr. Maxwell, 33, Pont Street, London, November 21, 1912. Many thanks ; I will come at 3'30 to-morrow. I am quite prepared to tell you all I know with perfect frankness (about German overtures to Turkey in the navigation question question), but I hope that I may be treated with equal frankness by the Department. I merely mention this, which I know you will not take amiss, because I scarcely thought that quality was quite as prominent as it might have been in the information conveyed to us by the Department in connection with the British negotia tions at Tehran not long ago in the matter of railway enterprise in Persia in which we were very closely interested. Yours sincerely, H. F. B. Lynch. On the 19th May a memorandum from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was handed to Mr. Lynch at the commencement of an interview at the Foreign Office between Messrs. Maxwell and Parker, representing the Department, and Mr. Lynch and Mr. F. W\ Parry, general manager, representing the British company. It is given on p. 14 of Print No. 1 . It laid down that the British company should not have the control of the new Turkish company, but that they should be given participation. The extent of such participation was left vague. It was intimated that certain names were suggested to the Foreign Office by the Board of Trade, in consulta tion with their commercial adviser, Sir F. Huth Jackson, for consideration by the Secretary of State in the appointment of a concessionnaire. This announcement fell like a bombshell upon the representatives of the British company, and they at once enquired what it meant. They were told in reply that it meant nothing hostile to the interests of the British company. It had been felt that, if the British company were given the control of the new Ottoman company a bad impression would be made in the British Parliament. Questions might be asked. But, it was added, there was every desire to meet the wishes of the British company in the matter of participation. So long as the actual concessionnaire should be some other person, the interests of the British company would be satisfied in the constitution of the new company. The Foreign Office were not competent to “ hammer out ” these arrangements ; this would be done by the Board of Trade, advised by some first-rate man of business and in consultation with the representatives of the British company. Mr. Lynch was earnestly requested to conform himself to the views of the Secretary of State, to go to the Board of Trade and harmonise them with the interests of the British company. Mr. Lynch at once pointed out that, if the control were vested in an outsider, the process of harmonising the interests of the British company resembled that of squaring a circle. In reply, he was. strongly urged to make an effort, and, at least, not to refuse the proposals of the Secretary of State without a thorough exploration of their possibilities. Under these circumstances, Mr. Lynch drew up the reply to the Secretary of State’s- memorandum, which is given on pp. 18, 19 of Print No. 1 . It was amended in conference with Mr. Parker (pp. 20 , 21 of Print No. 1 ), who assured Mr. Lynch that it would be treated as quite non-committal. It was evident that much would depend upon who was made concessionnaire, and that it was important that none should be actually appointed until after the further conferences with the Board of Trade. Out of respect for the loyal attitude towards the British company which had been maintained by the late Sir G. Mackenzie in the past, Mr. Lynch suggested that one of his associates Mr. Mackay (now Lord Inchcape) or Mr. Buchanan, might be made concessionnaire. Mr. Lynch was at once desired to “ hammer out ” arrangements with the Board of Trade. But, after the first conference, the Board of Trade disclaimed the function which it was clearly understood by the representatives of the British company that the Board would perform in the negotiations. It transpired that the concessionnaire had been [1825 t—1] G20 already appointed, and the Board stated that their function consisted m acting as inter, mediaries between him and the British company. The Board had already transmitted the views of the British company to Lord Inchcape; they now passed on Lord Inch- cape’s views. In spite of this remarkable change in the character of the negotiations, the representatives of the British company struggled hard to reconcile these conflicting views. The struggle proved vain; nor did the intervention or Mr. Lapel^ Slauo-hter, the well-known city solicitor, avail to alter the result. When was Lord Inchcape appointed? At a public dinner on the 9th June at which both Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch were present, Mr. Lynch mentioned to him that he had himself suggested Lord Inchcape’s name to the Secretary or State. He added an expression of his hope that arrangements would be made that might ^ be mutually satisfactory. Lord Inchcape displayed no sign of recognition ot this service, which indeed, he utterly scouted. He replied that he had been appointed concession- naire by the Foreign Office “ long ago,” and that all the correspondence had been submitted to him. “ Then,” interposed Mr. Lynch, “ you will remember the Secretary of State’s memorandum of the 19th May. It was just after that I suggested your name, after being told that names were still under consideration.” “Oh!” replied Lord Inchcape, “ it was long before that.” Nobody who knows them would for one moment dispute the perfect good faith of the gentlemen who negotiated with the representatives of the British company at the Foreign Office. Neither they nor the officials of the Board of Trade could have known what was taking place behind the scenes. What is certain is that the procedure indicated by the Foreign Office in connection with the memorandum of the 19th May was predestined to have the character of a farce. What are the motives which have inspired the substitution of Lord Inchcape for those who have conducted the negotiations with the Turkish Government for the control and management of the Turkish steamers, with the approval and support of the British Government, for so many years past, and who in 1909 obtained the adhesion to their proposals not only of the Ottoman Government, but also of the Ottoman Chamber ? It is difficult to find a reply that will carry conviction. The fear of criticism in the British Parliament—the reason given to the representatives of the British company—is a motive which the recital of the history of the case given above seems to apply to the course which has been taken rather than to that which it was sought to avoid. The reason given by Sir E. Grey, in reply to Lord Ronaldshay’s question (p. 7 above), to the effect that it was not desirable that the British company should have a monopoly and control over the whole navigation, is in conflict with the policy laid down by the Foreign Office on many occasions (see p. 14 above), in conflict with their action in supporting all those arduous negotiations of recent years, when Sir E. Grey himself was in office, and is, besides, utterly misleading. He infers that he is not creating a monopoly. He is. His proposals are based on a monopoly of sixty years for Lord Inchcape, a complete stranger to the navigation, over the entire steamship traffic on the Euphrates and Tigris, with the single exception of the three British steamers, which are to operate under a working agreement with the larger company presided over by Lord Inchcape. What is that in effect but a monopoly ? If Sir E. Grey should really desire to avoid the creation of a monopoly, .Jet him obtain from the Turkish Government powers for the British company to expand, according to the developments of the commerce on the rivers. He will then have created two independent bodies able to live and prosper side by side. It may be suggested by a superficial perusal of parts of the correspondence that the British Foreign Office have been actuated by apprehension lest the British company should dispose of some or all of their interests to the Germans, and should prove instru mental in bringing the Germans in. The only step which the British company have taken in relation to the Germans is a step which has set at rest the fears entertained in British circles as to the outcome of article 9 of the Bagdad Railway Concession. Whether it would be the best solution of Anglo-German commercial rivalries in these regions to keep German and British interests in watertight compartments, British interests being confined to the rivers and German interests to the railways ; or whether Germany should participate in the navigation and Great Britain in the railways, such railways being built ana controlled in the districts centring in Bagdad, and between Bagdad and the Gulf, by Anglo-German capital, are questions which those responsible for the British company have never presumed to decide. They have stated the pros and cons very fully to their Foreign Office, leaving the decision entirely in the hands of their Government. And they have offered to give guarantees, should such be considered desirable, and to render them legally binding, that all their share in these enterprises shall remain British. Can LordTnchcape offer better guarantees ? Can he offer as good, since he does not control either the British company or the Society des Transports fluviaux ? There remains questions of financial standing and experience in conducting the enterprise. The British company are prepared, if necessary, to place all the necessary capital at the Bank of England in the form of gilt-edged securities. And, as regards experience, would the Deutsche Bank have confided the management of the Societe to the local agents of the British company, if confidence in their abilities were not generally entertained ? Lastly, with the British company placed in control of the new Ottoman company, there would be ensured that unity of administration over the navigation which is best calculated to develop its possibilities in the future and to enable the British river transport to compete successfully with the German railway transport. Instead of two sets of local agents, there would be only one set. In the place of two expensive head offices, only one would be required. If, therefore, the motives which have actuated the Secretary of State must for the present remain inscrutable, the effects of his action upon the prospects of the British company admit of very little doubt. One cannot, of course, suppose that he realises this ; for otherwise, be would be engaged in a deliberate attack upon a business which has been built up by three generations of his countrymen in distant lands which have been brought within the sphere of his Department mainly as the result of their efforts. The British company have expanded within the last twelve years to the extent of being able to deal with a volume of cargo almost three times as great as before (p. 50-51 of Print No. 1 ). Under his proposals (p. 14 of Print No. 1 ) the present position is to be stereotyped for o-ood and all. They are never to ask for any further facilities. So restricted, what prospect will the British company have even of maintaining their present earnings, when the Turkish steamers have been handed over to European administration ^ under ^ a monopoly for sixty years ? No mere pooling arrangements can save them. They will be utterly swamped by the unrestricted operations of the monopoly, conducted by men who, at the best, would tolerate their existence. At the highest, their position will be that of satellites to the larger body. By a single article of a convention between Great Britain and Turkey, they are being placed at the mercy of a comparative stranger, who is to reap where they have sown. He is endowed with a business already worth several thousands a-year and capable of indefinite expansion at the expense of the British company. The Turkish envoy is instructed by the British Government to deal only with this gentleman. He is required to set aside the resolution of the Ottoman Chamber as if the British Secretary of State could set aside a resolution of the House of Commons ! The documents negotiated in 1909 by the British company are taken as the foundation of the new proposals ; their provisions are supplemented by the particulars up to date supplied from the same quarter. The names of the nominees of the British company are erased; Lord Inchcape’s name is put in their place. These are proceedings which at least require explanation. But the convention is not to be submitted to tbe Imperial Parliament before it has become an accomplisbed fact.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote •X- No. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

O i., ^ *4* i o 5 Minute by Mr. Parker. , MR. SLAUGHTER, Mr. Lynch’s solicitor, called to-day and made the following statement to me:— “ Mr. Lynch says frankly that he thinks it most likely that he did tell Said Ituete what Herr von Kuehlmann Says. It was natural to tell Said Kuete because that gentleman was Mr. Lynch’s intermediary in the negotia tion of the spring of 1913 with the Deutsche Bank, and he would naturally ask Mr. Lynch why those proposals led to nothing. Mr. Lynch is sure that everything he told Said Euete was under the seal of confidence and that it was prior to the last interview between Sir E. Grey and Lord Ronaldshay, and Mr. Lynch regrets that any undesirable use should have been or should be made of it. “I have advised Mr. Lynch that he must place full reliance on what has taken place between Sir E. Grey and Lord Eonaldshay, and do what he can with Said Euete in the sense desired by the Foreign Office, and that Lord Inchcape and Colonel Picot, and their lawyers should sit down in earnest to reach a satisfactory settlement. “With the consent of the Foreign Office I have advised Mr. Lynch to write to Said Euete in the above spirit. “ Mr. Lynch is irritated at the idea that the Foreign Office should consider that he is either directly or indirectly promoting or having anything to do with the press agitation, which he strenuously denies.” I said that I would submit this statement to Sir E. Grey; and Mr. Slaughter gave me an assurance that he would show me the draft of any letter which Mr. Lynch might write to Said Ruete on the subject. I gave a copy of this minute to Mr. Slaughter. August 29, 1913. A. R P.S.—The above was the “agreed” record of the interview : but I also told Mr„ Slaughter, as 1 had, under Sir E. Grey’s instructions, told his partner Mr. Mortimer on the 17th July, what Hakki Pasha had said to me on the 8 th July, viz.:— [1070]* 2 “ Hafeki Pasha began by saying that he had had a visit , from Mr. Lynch, who had spoken in the strongest terms, of the evil consequences which the Ottoman Government would incur from granting the concession to anyone but himself ; Mr. Lynch was determined to do his utmost to protect his own interests; he would take legal action against the Ottoman Government; he would carry on a political agitation against it in Constantinople and Mesopotamia ; he would expose the action of Hakki Pasha in favouring the concession, and indeed .his w^ole mission ‘ to England, to the most damaging criticism through his friends in Turkey; he had already engaged the services of a Turkish lawyer; he had also consulted Sir T. Barclay, a man of great legal experience; and he would carry on a press and political propaganda jiy England.” I also told Uim that Mr. Lynch’s Company hb&lt;l sent a signed letter to HaLki Pasha, whichi. coim eluded with the following sentences :— “I need scarcely a^dd that, in case the Imperial Ottonpin^ Government should, grant this exclusive concession to a third party, this Company would be seriously injured. My board, therefore, cherishes the hope that your Highness^ will relieve us of the necessity of asserting our just claims, based upon secular rights, by acceding to our request.” I further said thaf Mr. Lyuch had been over to, Paris and hgd induced Djavid Bey to recommend the Ottoman Government not to grant the* concession; but that Hakki Pasha had sub sequently in luced Djavid Bey to reverse this adviqe. I objected that Mr. Lynch was entirely unjustified in asserting that the Foreign Office had been provocative, which was the expression, used in a letter to Mr. Slaughter from Mr. Lynch. I said, and Mr. Slaughter admitted unofficially that he agreed, that the Foreign Office wouldf have had ample justification in throwing over Mr. Lynch altogether in. view of what he had, by- independent but concurrent testimony, done. Mr. Slaughter told me that he had only last June made the acquaintance of Mr. Lynch, who had come with an introduction from Mr. Lawrence. He would tell him in the most unequivocal terms that if agitation continued he, Mr. Slaughter, would throw up his brief in disgust; hut he asked me to make it clear that Mr. Lynch’s last communication with Said Ruete' had taken place before, and not after, Sir E. Grey’s final con-, versation with Lord Ronaldshay. r*'■ .iMH 3 I said I would make tliis clear, though, even if it was a palliation of Mn Lynch’s breach of confidence, it did not exonerate him. I added that we were in communication with Lord Inchcape respecting Mr. Lynch’s last proposals, and that they would be examined on their merits after the above record had been submitted to Sir E. Grey. I added that it was essential that any further negotiations on behalf of Mr. Lynch should take place through Colonel Picot or Mr. Slaughter, and not directly with Mr. Lynch; and I. laid great stress upon the necessity of restraining Mr. Lynch, and arresting the mischief which had been done. I feel strongly that, on the whole, a compromise between Mr. Lynch and Lord Inchcape, on the lines of the latest proposals, is desirable in the interests of a general settlement, provided Lord Inchcape has control. I feel that by such an arrangement we shall, better than in any other way, draw the claws of Mr. Lynch. A. P.

IN handing you a confidential print, which has been prepared for the Board of my Company C‘ Euphrates and Tigris Navigation. No. 2 . Proceedings in Parliament and explanatory documents, 1913”), together with a summary of the same which has been drawn up for the convenience of the Secretary of State, I desire to make it clear that mv colleao-ues and myself are not animated by any contentious spirit. We have endeavoured to arrive at the true facts of the case with the object of laying them before the Foreio-n Office in the expectation that justice will be done. The one matter personal to myself is that-of the negotiations for the formation of a Turkish company under British control to replace the existing Turkish line of steamers on the Tigris, with which I was intimately connected for several vears and concerning which there still appears to be a serious misunderstanding in respect of the relations between the Foreign Office and my company. These negotiations were proceeding in one form or another during the years 1907-10, and I w^s closely connected with them both in London and in my capacity of special repre sentative of my company in Constantinople. I was in constant touch both with our Ambassador in Constantinople and with the Foreign Office here, and to the best of my belief I had the fullest support of both. As regards the “ fusion scheme of 1909, you will find an explanation on p. 7 of Print No. 2 in an account of an interview I had with Lord Hardinge on this very subject on the 20 th September, 1910. The fusion was proposed by the Turks to me as the only feasible method of putting the matter through at that time. I consulted His Majesty’s Ambassador before proceeding with it. He informed me that the proposal had his approval. ^ ^ • , i + • His Maiesty’s Ambassador was kept fully informed of every step m the negotia tions and I fancy he must have been heartily sick of seeing me on the subject. i should be obliged if you would lay the summary of Print No. 2 before Sir E.

THE following parliamentary questions and answers on this subject are taken from the Official Beport for the 22 nd July, 1913 . “ Euphrates and Tigris Navigation.

Will he say if His Majesty’s Government are seeking to make it a condi tion of' their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties that a monopoly of the navigation of these rivers shall be granted for ^ period of sixty years to a new Anglo-Turkish company, distinct from the existing British company ; . “ 7 . And, if so, will he say for what reason it is sought to take the tormation ot the proposed new company out of the hands of the existing British company ? “ The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir E. Grey). The reply to the first question is that the company named has, under strict limitations, participated m, but not conducted, the whole navigation of the Tigris since 1862 ; the reply to the second question is m the affirmative; the reply to the third question is in the negative, for His Majesty’s Government were not aware of the commencement of negotiations m 1909 ; the reply to the fourth question, in so far as concerns the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, is that the negotiations for the fusion of the British and Turkish companies were entered into by Mr. Lynch m 1909 without knowledge of the Foreign Office, who, in that year, first obtained information on the subject from the late Sir G. Mackenzie, of the British India Steam Navigation Company ; he had been negotiating, with the approval and support of His Majesty’s Government, since the year 1901 for control over the Turkish line of steamers. In June 1909 Sir George Mackenzie agreed to withdraw for the time from competition, and he induced other British firms in Meso potamia to withdraw active opposition to the Lynch fusion scheme, and from then, until the breakdown of negotiations in July 1910, British diplomatic support was given to Mr. Lynch’s scheme. The answer to the fourth question, in so far as concerns the reso lution of the Ottoman Chamber, is in the affirmative. The answer to the fifth question is that the resolution stipulated that there should be no financial liability, as proposed under the scheme, upon the Turkish Treasury, and the Turkish Government declined to proceed with it because considerable opposition to it was manifested in Bagdad and Basra, and a strong feeling against it developed in the Turkish Chamber in view of that opposition. The answer to the sixth question is that the proposal is to form an Ottoman company with British participation, and at the same time to safeguard and confirm the rights actually enjoyed by the existing British company, of which Mr. Lynch is chairman. The answer to the last question is that I am concerned with the general interests of British trade in those regions rather than with the particular advantage of an individual firm ; that, with this object in view, I do not consider it the most desirable solution that the existing British company should have a monopoly of and control over the whole navigation. The arrangement contemplated would secure to the existing British company the confirmation of its existing separate privileges, and the offer of participation in the capital of, and a fair working agreement with, the proposed new Ottoman company. “ Earl of Ronaldshay asked the Secretary o’f State for Foreign Affairs the nature of the assurances which he has received from the German Government on the subject of the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates ; and will he give the House an opportunity of considering the terms of the proposed convention with Turkey, together with the cognate arrangements with the German Government, before the convention is actually concluded ? “SirE. Grey. —I cannot at present make any statement respecting the negotiations on this subject, which are still in progress. The arrangements, when completed, will be laid before Parliament, but it would not be usual or practicable to make their conclusion dependent upon previous discussion in the House.” It is quite evident that the Secretary of State has been misinformed in giving this answer. We will take the questions and answers one by one. “ 1 . Question. —During how many years the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris Livers had been conducted by the c Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company ’ ? “ Answer. —The company named has, under strict limitations, participated in, but not conducted, the whole navigation of the Tigris since 1862.” It is important to note that no limitations were mentioned by the Foreign Office to the founders of the company, when the founders approached the Foreign Office in1862 before actually forming the company. (See Foreign Office letter of the 17th February, 1860, Print No. 2 , page 5.) Subsequently to the formation of the company, the Tuikish Government have all along sought to impose limitations on the - number of steamers to be employed. In spite of these attempts, the company has been able to increase its fleet through negotiation. Thus, within the last twelve years, they have increased their fleet in this way to the extent of being able to deal with a volume of cargo almost three times as great as before. (Print No. 2 , page 26.) 2 . Question. Whether the company is a British company, flying the British flag ? “ Answer. —The answer is in the aflirmative. “ 3. Question. —Whether the company, with the approval of His Majesty’s Govern ment, entered into negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1909 with a view to the foundation of a new Turkish company under its management, to take over the Turkish Government steamers plying upon the rivers ? “Answer. —The reply to the third question is in the negative, for His Majesty’s Government were not aware of the commencement of the negotiations in 1909.” The negotiations in 1909 were undertaken by the company, not only with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, but in consequence of pressure brought to bear upon the company by the Foreign Office. On the 22 nd October, 1908, Colonel Picot, director of the British company, visited the Foreign Office, and saw Sir C. Hardinge, who had, on more than one occasion, clearly given Colonel Picot to understand that, if his company were not prepared to negotiate for the control of the Turkish steamers other British firms were. During the course of this interview Sir C. Hardinge observed that the civil list of the Sultan would probably now be needing money; and he urged that the company’s representative in Constantinople should watch the situation very closely, so that the first favourable opportunity might be taken to open negotiations. During the course of this same interview Sir C. Hardinge mentioned for the first time the possibility that the British company might have to drop the British flag in arriving at an amalgamation of interests with the Turkish steamer adminis tration. Early in 1909 Colonel Picot was in Constantinople with the object of giving effect to the wishes expressed by Sir C. Hardinge. The situation had, in the meanwhile, been closely watched by the company’s representative in that city, Mr. E. Whittall; and he reported on the 9th February, 1909, by which time Colonel Picot had already arrived, that the Minister of the Civil List had at last made up his mind to transfer the Turkish steamers to a private company, and was prepared to entertain offers. Colonol Picot was instructed by his colleagues to do his best to arrive at an arrangement under which the question of the flag on the British steamers should not be raised at all. This he found himself unable to effect. Messrs. Picot and Whittall then drew out a scheme creating a single Ottoman company under British control, which should absorb both the Turkish line of steamers and the British line. The scheme had the full approval of the British Ambas sador in Constantinople, Sir G. Lowther ; and as the Sultan might have to abdicate at any moment, when the steamers would probably be transferred from the civil list to a Government department, and fresh negotiations would have to be commenced, Colonel Picot was authorised by telegraph on the 1 st April, 1909. to sign the contract, subject to the approval of Sir G. Lowther. That approval had already been given, but it was unfortunately impossible actually to conclude the transaction before the Sultan was deposed. (See Print No. 2 , pp. 7, 8 , 17.) “ 4. Question. —Whether, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the scope of these negotiations was subsequently enlarged so as to include the British company and a resolution passed by the Ottoman Chamber authorising the Turkish Government to conclude the transaction with the British company ? “ Answer. —The reply to the fourth question, in so far as concerns the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, is that the negotiations for the fusion of the British and Turkish companies were entered into by Mr. Lynch in 1909 without knowledge of the Foreign Office, who, in that year, first obtained information on the subject from the late Sir G. Mackenzie, of the British India Steam Navigation Company; he had been negotiating, with the approval and support of His Majesty’s Government, since the year 1901 for control over the Turkish line of steamers. In June 190]9 Sir G. Mackenzie agreed to withdraw for the time from competition, and he induced other British firms of Mesopotamia to withdraw active opposition to the Lynch fusion scheme, [1825 t— 1 ] B 2and from then until the breakdown of negotiations in July 1910 British diplomatic S,% P-rhTan^er t fhe fourth quS in so far as concerns the resolution of the Ottoman Chamber, is in the affirmative. ^ The facts are that the British company have negotiated with the Turkish company O ‘ tmentlnlSSr ^ 1 8^ r t^ sctemrSed the receiving the approval of the “ couseil legiste ” at Constantinople. In 1907 the British company despatched no less than three special missions to Constantinople with this obiect. These missions had the full approval of the British Government In 1908 Colonel Picot was again in charge of a special mission of this nature, from the middle of February, with the full support of the British Foreign Office and the British Ambissador During 1909 Colonel Picot’s mission extended for many months, and he was assisted throughout by Mr. E. Wbittall. The particular form given to the negotiations during 1909, namely, a fusion between the British company and the Turkish steamers, received the approval of the British Ambassador, after having already been mentioned to Colonel Pieot by the Foreign Office in the autumn of 1908, as a possible solution of the question. (Print No. 2 p 16 ) Mr. Lynch was in Constantinople during the course of these negotiations. If the Foreign Office were not informed by the British Ambassador himself of the form which the negotiations had taken, that is an oversight which it is difficult to explain. The course of the various negotiations is traced with some detail in Print No. 2 , pp. 12 — 20 . Special leference should also be made to pp. 6 and 7 of Print No. 2 . . The relations of the British company to the late Sir George Mackenzie, and the attitude taken up in this question by Sir G. Mackenzie, are set out on pp. 7, 8 , 9, 13, 14, 16, and 17 of Print No. 2 , where Sir G. Mackenzie’s own letters are quoted. Sir G. Mackenzie’s attitude towards the British company in respect of negotiations for the control of the Turkish steamers may be summarised in his own words to the effect that he had no intention of taking the place of the British company, and that he only desired to see possible competitors in Mesopotamia kept away from the river. Over and over again he described his own overtures at the Foreign Office as designed to “keep the door open ” for action by the British company. As regards the negotiations of 1909, Sir E. Grey has been completely misinformed when he states that in June 1909 Sir Gearge Mackenzie agreed to withdraw for the time from competition. If he was ever competing, which he himself would have denied, he had certainly withdrawn in the early spring of 1909, when he authorised Mr. Lynch to telegraph to Colonel Picot, in Constantinople, that he concurred that a preponderating share in the proposed new Ottoman company should be acquired by the British company. Sir E. Grey is also misinformed when he states that Sir G. Mackenzie induced other British firms in Mesopotamia to withdraw from active opposition to the fusion scheme. The British company themselves approached all the leading British firms, and Sir E. Grey would appear to have been misled by the fact that the memorial in favour of the scheme, which was addressed to the Foreign Office by the British firms on the 10 th March, 1910, was sent in by the late Sir George Mackenzie’s firm. The reason for that was that it seemed to the directors of the British company more tactful that such a memorial should be transmitted by one of the firms concerned rather than by themselves. The text of the memorial in favour of the fusion scheme is given in Print No. 2 , pp. 9 and 10. * “5. Question .—Whether this resolution has been given effect to, and, if not, for what reason has it not 1 “ Answer .—The answer to the fifth question is that the resolution stipulated that there should be no financial liability, as proposed under the scheme, upon the Turkish Treasury, and the Turkish Government declined to proceed with it because considerable opposition to it was manifested in Bagdad and Basra, and a strong feeling against it developed in the Turkish Chamber in view of that opposition.” This answer would seem to infer that the scheme broke down for two reasons. First, because it involved financial liability upon the Turkish Treasury ; and, secondly, because a strong feeling against it developed in the Turkish Chamber owing to local opposition in Bagdad and Basra. The facts, however, are as follows : First, theprovisions in the scheme involving financial liability upon the Turkish Treasury were dropped ; and, secondly, after hearing all about the local opposition at Bagdad and Basra, the Turkish Chamber passed the resolution authorising the Government to “ grant the concession by 168 votes to 8 votes. (See Print No. 2 , p. 20 .) “ 6 . Question .—Will he say if His Majesty’s Government are seeking to make it a condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties that a monopoly of the navigation of these rivers shall be granted for a period of sixty years to a new Anglo-Turkish company distinct from the existing British company ? “ Answer .—The answer to the sixth question is that the proposal is to form an Ottoman company with British participation, and at the same time to safeguard and confirm the rights actually enjoyed by the existing British company, of which Mr. Lynch is chairman.” It will be noticed that this answer avoids the kernel of the cpiestion, namely, whether it is proposed to endow the new Ottoman company with exclusive rights or, in other words, to create a monopoly for it. As for safeguarding and confirming the rights of the existing British company, Sir E. Grey was careful to add the words “ actually enjoyed.” The British Government have always maintained that the rights of the British company could not justly be limited by the Turkish Government to those which they actually enjoyed; and it is in consequence of this contention on the part of their Government that the British company have been able, during the last twelve years, practically to treble the resources of their fleet through negotiations wuth the Turkish Government. The British Government now propose to limit the rights of the British company to the extent to which that company have been able, up to 1913, to obtain recognition of those rights. Thus, in the same convention, which is to bestow upon a stranger to the navigation the right of placing steamers on the Euphrates and Tigris, without any restriction as to numbers, a clause is to be inserted stereotyping for ever the position of the British company. The British company will then be limited to three steamers, while the new company will be empowered to employ any number. It is quite true that Sir E. Grey does not state in his answer that he proposes under the convention to limit the rights of the British company to those which they actually enjoy. Nor does he state that the new Ottoman company is to enjoy exclusive rights. Indeed, the natural construction of his answer is that he proposes to do neither of these things. Of course, if exclusive rights are not to be conferred on the new Ottoman company, and if the British company are to have their present position safeguarded without any restriction as to the future, the situation would be a very different one to that which we believe to be the real situation. “ 7 . Question .—If so, will he say for what reason it is sought to take_ the formation of the proposed new company out of the hands of the existing British company ? “Answer .—The answer to the last question is that I am concerned with the general interests of British trade in those regions rather than with the particular advantage of an individual firm ; that, with this object in view, I do not consider it the most desirable solution that the existing British company should have a monopoly of and control over the whole navigation. The arrangement contemplated would^ secure to the existing British company the confirmation of its existing separate privileges, and the offer of participation in the capital of, and a fair working agreement with, the proposed new Ottoman company.” We have reason to believe the actual facts to be the following : It is proposed to bestow upon the chairman of the British India Steam Navigation Compan} 7 ' the monopoly of and control over the whole navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris with the exception of three steamers belonging to the British company, which are to be prohibited from ever increasing their fleet, dhe participation in the capital of the new Ottoman company which is offered to the British company is one-sixth of the whole, whereas the chairman of the British India Company, a complete strangei to the navigation, is to be allowed more than one-third. Neither the British company nor their agents are to have any share whatever in the management of the new Ottoman company, which is, of course, the lucrative part of the business. Even the working agreement which is offered could not be rendered effective, under such conditions as regards participation, over a long period of years. Without any effective voice in the control and management of the new Ottoman company, how could the British company, limitedto their three steamers, survive for sixty years alongside of the Ottoman company as an independent and prosperous company ? Sir E. Greys reference to the general interests of British trade in those regions has a curious sound when it is remembered that it is the chairman of the British India 0 line who is to be invested with the monopoly over the traffic on the rivers of Mesopotamia. There are several other British lines of steamers plying to the Persian Gulf, and the advantage to the British India line over their rivals, once they have obtained control over the river traffic, is too obvious to require assertion. The British company on the Tigris are, on the other hand, not connected with any of the ocean lines,, and they have always meted out equal measure to all of them.[This Docu ment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Goveraineiit.] r [B] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

AT a board meeting held yesterday at the offices of this company, I was instructed to draw your attention to the question of the form in which the lights of this company may be safeguarded in the negotiations now pending between His Maiesty’s Government and the Turkish Government. In the Secretary of State s memorandum of the 19th May, this company were asked not to look for any support by His Maiesty’s Government to any claim on their part for more extensive rights o navigation on the rivers than those which they practically exercise at the present. You will however, recognise that it is of the utmost importance that His Majesty s Government should not debar themselves from claiming at some future time the extension of the rights which this company is at the present time permitted to exercise. It ought to be quite possible to specify and safeguard the rights actually exercised without closing the door upon their extension m the future. fVwp-mmpnt This is the more important, from the point of view of His Majesty s Gover e t, in view of the fact that the Turkish Government will either now, or before the convention becomes an accomplished fact, seek to introduce a break m the period or which the monopoly is to be conferred upon the new Ottoman company, at the date of £ breakSurkish Government would ^ entitled under certam con^ terminate the monopoly.

CONFIDENTIAL. [37439] [August 13.] Section 3 . Lord Inchcape to Mr. Parker.—(Received August 13.) My dear Parker, Rosehall, Sutherland, August 11, 1913. WITH reference to your letter of the 9tli, I give you, as desired, my remarks on the papers you sent me. The British draft of article 2 (d) is worded as follows :— “ The construction of the proposed port at Basra shall be executed in a manner to he mutually agreed upon, and so that British participation in the undertaking shall amount to 50 per cent, of the whole.” But the German draft as submitted is :— “ The construction of the proposed ports at Basra and Bagdad shall be executed by a separate Ottoman company, wherein British participation shall amount to not less that 20 per cent, of the whole (see covering note from German Ambassador as to percentage). The statutes and { cahiers des charges’ of the ports of Basra and Bagdad company and concession shall be formed on the model of the Haidar-Pasha Port Company (see article 2 (d) of British draft).” The British draft makes no reference to a port at Bagdad, and I think it is rather clever of the Germans to have introduced this. As a matter of fact, they know perfectly well that no “ port ” is wanted at Bagdad, and no port can ever be made^ there. No ocean-going steamers can ever get within 500 miles of Bagdad, and it is ridiculous to speak of a port there. I think the Germans have tacked Bagdad on to Basia, and have offered us a share in the “ port ” there so as to secure for themselves a larger share in Basra, which can really be made a port for deep draft vessels if the bhatt-ei- Arab below 7 Basra is dredged and the bar at the mouth lemoved. ^ My conclusion as to German motives is borne out by what Prince Lichnowsky says in his letter to Sir Edward Grey, dated the 16th July. He says under section (d ): “ At first it v T as only contemplated to give British capital a participation in the port of Basra, but the Bagdad Railway Company have been induced to grant the same participation for the port of Bagdad, this being considered an important concession,” Ac. And it is setup as a reason for reducing British participation in the control of the port of Basra from 50 per cent, to 20 per cent, of the whole, which might mean 10 per cent, of Basra. This is all humbug. As I have said, there is nothing to be done at Bagdad in the way of mating a port, and nothing is required whereas Basra will enormously increase in importance as time goes on, and i is ign y c esna British interests should preponderate there. . r. Even 50 per cent, is too little for Great Britain. I have not the figures by me but I think you will find that at least 80 per cent, of the shipping frequenting Basra is British, and I rather think the British India Company itself contributes 50 per cent, of the total tonnage visiting the port, if not more. , + 1 ^ I would strongly advise that the British draft be adhered to if more than 50 per cent, cannot now be got, and that we should magnanimous y waive all nght to any participation in Bagdad, because, as I have said, there wi neT ,® 1 .pi ;; ' V there. We might as well talk of making one at Mapledurham on the Thames. I am not sure that I have put forward my views m such a form ® tb^U as to pass them on to the Germans, but you will be able to ex rac as I 1 ™ 0 * oris-inal will allow you to put forward good and sufficient reasons or a enng y draft. From the Tigris navigation point of view it is most important that no e should be given for throwing money away at Bagdad. It is very important that Bagda should be kept out altogether so far as “ ports go. I return the papers as desired. Yours &amp;c our ’ INOHCAPE. A CO m !

August (Ho.37754) relative to a memorandum by Kr.U.F.B. Lynch recently communicated to your Department by Colonel Ficot, respecting the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers; and to offer the following observations t/iereon* The proposal contained in the memorandum in question appears to mark a distinct change in the attitude recently | taken up by Fr. Lynch, and to offer at least the possibil ity of an acceptable arrangement. The Board therefore consider that the memorandum should-be communicated to Lord Inchcape in order to elicit the expression of his opinion, and they concur in Sir E.

With regard to the details of Hr. Lynch's present proposal, 1 art. to say that the claim on behalf of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam navigation Company (which would seem to be indicated in the third paragraph of the memorandum) to subscribe practically one-half of the ^ capital of the new Ottoman Kavigation Company, is in the \ opinion of the Board excessive - it is understood that i; \ Lord inchcape is not prepared to concede more than one- third, or at most 40 per cent and they do not think that he can reasonably be asked to do so. hut they see no objeo * tion in principle to the scheme for the formation of a separate company to manage the new Ottoman Company and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, (and 1 in which the shares should be held by those two undertakings in equal proportions. They recognise that the arrangement might avoid the economic waste resulting from the existence ofof separate managements for t’?/o enterprises which, it has always been assumed would be operating in close accord. The details of the scheme, if accepted in principle, would of course need careful consideration. The Board are disposed to think that at the outset any arrangement of the nature proposed might be adopted only for a limited term of years; and as regards the important matter of the directorate that the chairman should be chosen by the directors, and only in the event of their failing to agree should he be nominated by some outside body. In this connexion I am to add that, in the opinion of the Board, the London Chamber of Commerce would be quite unsuitable, and it is doubtful if the Bank of England, which lias also been mentioned, would undertake the duty* In any event it would appear preferable that the nomination, if and when necessary, should be made by His l.ajesty*s Government, I have &amp;c,, (Signed) H* Llewellyn Smith.11 r r opy. 3640) 33, ONSLOW GARDENS, S.W. 2 71 b Augu b t, 1913.

The concessionnaire and the company shall be free from all kinds of taxes, charges, rates, duties, dues, or assessments, now or at any time hereafter to be imposed, levied, or charged by the Imperial Ottoman Government, or by local authorities, municipalities, conservancies, or other bodies whatsoever, both in respect of the exercise* of the rights, liberties, and authorities hereby granted, and in respect of real estate, buildings, vessels, stock, funds, and other property and revenues, with the exception of ( 1 ) the duties pay able to “ vacoufs,” ( 2 ) municipal taxes levied for services rendered, (3) dues for the improve ments in the waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, in so far as the vessels of the company derive direct advantage from suclv improvements, and would thus be liable to payment of the dues, regard being had to the reduced tariff which shall be impartially applied by the commission ad hoc to all vessels exclusively occupied in river naviga tion, ( 4 ) the taxes relating to any revenue-bearing house property which the company may have in its possession otherwise than for the requirements of its service. The materials, iron, wood, coal, machines, carriages, wa.ggons, and other supplies and stores necessary for the initial establishment of the river service as well as for the maintenance in good order and eventual increase thereof, which the conces sionnaire or the company shall purchase within the Ottoman Empire or import from abroad, shall always be exempted from all internal taxes or customs dues.

The constitution and statutes of the com pany shall be such and in such form as the con cessionnaire shall in his absolute discretion deem best suited to the objects of the company. Pro vided nevertheless that such statutes shall (subject to any agreement between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionnaire or the company to the contrary) contain provisions securing that: — (a.) There shall be a president of the company, who shall be an Ottoman subject nominated by the Imperial Ottoman Government. (b.) The president, or in his absence the chair man of the board of directors, shall preside at all general meetings of the shareholders, and in case of equality of voting shall have a casting vote in addition to the vote or votes to which he may be entitled as a shareholder.

(d.) The Imperial Ottoman Government shall nominate one-half of the first directors of the company. The other half of the first directors of the company shall be nominated by the conces- sionnaire. After the first appointment of directors any vacancy among the directors appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government shall be filled by a new director nominated by the said Government, and any vacancy among the other directors shall be filled by a new director nominated by the chairman of the board of directors. Provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent the board of directors (hereinafter referred to as “ the board ”) from acting at any time during which the constitution of the board shall not comply with the provision last above mentioned. Each director shall have one vote at each meeting of the board as long as the chairman of the board, or in his absence the vice-chairman of the board, shall not decide that the directors shall vote by units. As far as the present article is concerned, the directors nominated by the Imperial Ottoman Government shall form one unit and the other directors the other unit. Each unit so constituted shall have one vote which shall be given in accordance with the wishes of the majority of members of that unit present at the meeting; and, in case such members shall be equally divided, the president of the company, in the case of the directors nominated by the Imperial Ottoman Government, and the chairman of the board, or in his absence the vice-chairman of the board, in the case of the other directors, shall respectively be entitled to a casting vote in determining how the vote of that unit shall be cast. In case of equality of voting at any board meeting at which the directors are voting by units, the chairman of the board, or in his absence the vice-chairman of the board, shall have a casting vote in addition to the vote of his unit. The board may determine the quorum necessary to constitute a meeting of the board, provided that the presence of two directors nominated by8 the concessionnaire or by the chairman of the board shall always be requisite to constitute a quorum. (e.) The chairman of the board and also the vice-chairman of the board shall always be British subjects. At every meeting of the board the chair man of the board, if present, or in his absence the vice-chairman of the board, shall preside,and in case of equality of voting at any meeting of the board shall have a casting vote in addition to his ordin ary vote as a director. The first chairman of the board shall be the concesdonnaire, who shall re tain such office during his pleasure. On tlie death or resignation of any chairman of the board the vice-chairman of the board shall succeed to the chairmanship ; or if there shall at the tmie being be no vice-chairman, then the chairman of the board shall be elected by the votes of the directors nominated by the concessionnaire or the chairman of the board. The first vice-chairman of the board shall be nominated by the concessionnaire, and shall hold office at the pleasure of the con- eessionnaire, and every subsequent vice-chairman shall be nominated by the chairman of the board and shall hold office at the pleasure of the chairman of the board. (/.) The company shall take over and adopt any provisional contracts or agreements for the appointment of managers, managing agents, or agents made by the concessionnaire on behalf of the company prior to its incorporation. (r/.) Subject to the provisions herein contained, the entire conduct and management of the affairs of the company shall be vested in the b''ard. (h.) The powers of the board shall only be controlled, limited, or extended by a resolution passed by a majority of not less than three-fourths of the members of the company entitled to vote as are present in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company, and the statutes of the company shall only be altered by a like resolution. Provided that statutes concerning the clauses of this concession shall not be subject to modification except after agreement between the company, the chairman of the board, and the Imperial Ottoman Government. (i.) The head office of the company shall be at Constantinople : the company shall have the right to establish offices in other towns in the Otto man Empire or abroad. The board of directors shall meet, in accordance with its own decision, atv- 9 one of the offices of the company, and the place of the general meeting of shareholders must be fixed each time by the board of directors. (j.) No transfer of shares in the company shall be valid until approved by the board, and also, if the transferor be a British subject, approved by the chairman of the board. Any such approval may be given or withheld at the absolute discretion of the board or of the chairman, as the case may be, and without their being liable to state the ground of any such refusal. Provided that, in the case of any proposed transfer in which the transferor is not an Ottoman subject, no transfer may be approved until the shares in question have been first offered to and refused by a British subject or subjects approved by the chairman of the board, and subsequently offered to an Ottoman subject or subjects approved by the Imperial Ottoman Government; and in the case of any proposed transfer in which the trans feror is an Ottoman subject, no transfer may take place unless the purchaser is an Ottoman subject approved by the Imperial Ottoman Government. Every such offer must be an offer of the shares free of any charge or encumbrance whatsoever, and without any 7 condition or restriction other than such as may be attached to the shares by the statutes of the company, and at the fair market price, or, if there is no market, then at such price as the board may determine to be the fair value thereof. Any such offer shall be deemed to have been refused if it is not accepted within one month of the communication thereof to the Imperial Otto man Government or to the concessionnaire or to the chairman of the board, as the case may be. No shares or share warrants stating that the bearer thereof is entitled to the shares specified therein shall be issued, nor any share certificates including or having on the back thereof an instrument of transfer. No share shall be trans ferable otherwise than by a written instrument of transfer registered in the books of the company. (L) The statutes may contain such provisions as the concessionnaire shall think fit with respect to the following matters, viz. : — (l.) For regulating the conditions under which (if at all) any corporation shall be permitted to be a shareholder in the company. [918—11] D10 (2.) For ensuring that no shares in the company shall be held by the holder thereof, directly or indirectly, upon trust tor, or for the benefit or account of, or subject to the control of any othei person, persons, or corporations whatsoever not expressly approved by the directors, and for enabling the directors to prevent any infringe ment of this provision by compelling a transfer of the shares by the holder, or otherwise as the directors may think fit. 15. The statutes shall further contain provisions for securing that the number of shares allotted by the company at the first allotment shall be allotted in equal proportions to Ottoman and British subjects. For the purpose of fixing the amount of the initial share capital to be paid up, so as to meet the requirements of the company, the directors may make such provision as to the amount to be paid up on the shares issued to British subjects as they may think fit, and may thereafter make such provisions as to calling for further payments in respect of such shares as they may from time to time think fit. 16. At a date (hereinafter referred to as the date of transfer) to be subsequently determined between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionnaire but not, except with the consent of the concessionnaire, to be more than two calendar months after the date of the forma tion of the company, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall transfer to the company, free of all mortgages, charges, liens, or other incumbrances :— (a.) The property in which the Imperial Ottoman Government possesses any right or interest enumerated in the first part of the second schedule hereto. (h.) Such other property as the concessionnaire shall elect in pursuance of article 17 hereof. (c.) The benefit of such of the contracts enumerated in the second part of the second schedule hereto as the concessionnaire shall elect to be transferred. All property which is to be transferred by the Imperial Ottoman Government to the company shall be at the risk of the Imperial Ottoman Government until actually transferred to the company. 17. Upon the signature of this concession the Imperial Ottoman Government and the conces-11 sionnaire shall forthwith severally nominate an agent, and the agents so nominated shall prepare in conjunction a detailed list (herein referred to as List (A)) of the items of property included in Part I of the second schedule, and also a list (herein referred to as List (B)) of other property of the Imperial Ottoman Government employed in the business of navigation on the waters de fined in article 9 which the Imperial Ottoman Government is willing to transfer, but is not included in Part I of the said schedule, and also, so far as is possible, having regard to the fact that the date of transfer may not be determined, a list (herein referred to as List (C)) of the con tracts included in Part II of the said schedule, with full particulars as to the terms thereof. Any corrections in the last-mentioned list shall from time to time be communicated to the concession- naire’s agent. Not less than one month before the date fixed as the date of transfer the conces- sionnaire shall communicate to the Imperial Ottoman Government the items of property included in List (B), which he desires to be transferred to the company, and the contracts included in List (C), the benefit of which he desires to be transferred to the company. 18. The consideration to be given to the Imperial Ottoman Government for the transfer of the property in List (A), and the property in List (B), which the concessionnaire elects to he trans ferred as aforesaid, shall be the fair value thereof, to be satisfied as provided in article 19. Such value shall not include any enhancement of value which might he attributed to them by reason of the existence of any good-will attaching to the navigation business now carried on by the Imperial Ottoman Government, or by reason of any exclusive rights granted to, or any obligations imposed upon, the company. In case of failure to the said value the same shall be detei mined as provided in article 21. 19. The said consideration shall be satisfied by the allotment to a nominee or nominees of the Imperial Ottoman Government of shares in the company issued as fully paid, the nominal value of which shall be equal to the value determined in accordance with the provisions of article 18, and the amount of such consideration shall consti tute the Ottoman one-hall of the share capital referred to in article 15. 20. The consideration for the transfer of the12' benefit of the contracts included in List (L), which the concessionnaire shall elect to be trans ferred shall be the undertaking by the company to perform the reciprocal obligations which would otherwise have to be performed in respect thereof by the Imperial Ottoman Government, such obli gation being apportioned when necessary, so that the ratio of the obligation to be undertaken by the company to the whole obligation originally undertaken by the Imperial Ottoman Government shall be equal to the ratio of the benefit trans ferred to the company to the whole benefit originally secured to the Imperial Ottoman Government in accordance with the terms of the eo a tract. 21. In case of failure to agree as to the apportionment of such contracts, or as to the value of the properties to be transferred as afore said any difference shall be determined by an arbitrator to be mutually agreed by the company and the Imperial Ottoman Government, and failing agreement to be selected by the President of the Court of Appeal at Paris. 22. The fact that such difference may not have been determined at the date of transfer shall not be a reason for postponing the transfer, and the consideration for the transfer shall be secured by the issue of shares or by the issue of shares and the deposit, in a bank to be agreed upon, of cash or securities to the amount claimed, as the value of the property transferred by the Imperial Ottoman Government, and the Imperial Ottoman Government shall undertake that in the event of toe value as determined by the arbitrator beino- less than the nominal value of the shares so issued, to subscribe in cash for the excess of si)ares allotted. 23. The company may, so far as they deem it necessary or desirable for the purposes of their undertaking, construct and open upon land required by them, docks, wharves, piers, landing- stages, slipways, beacons, warehouses, workshops, depots, and the like, which may be kept private or opened to the public upon such terms as the company may determine. Provided that nothing herein contained shall detract from the rights conferred on the Bagdad Bail way Company by article 23 of the Bagdad Bail way Convention of the 5 th March, 1903 (February 20th, 1318), which rights are fully reserved.13 24. The enterprise being of public utility, land from time to time required by the company for the construction of docks, wharves, piers, landing stages, slipways, beacons, warehouses, workshops, depots, and the like, or lands otherwise required for the purposes of the company’s undertaking, belonging to private persons, shall be taken over in accordance with the law in expropriation, whenever it has not proved possible to come to an understanding between the company and the owners for the purchase of such land. The Imperial Ottoman Government shall expropriate and hand over to the company the land so required and everything appertaining thereto. If any part of the land so required belongs to the Imperial Ottoman Government and is unoccupied, it shall be handed over free of charge to the company. Land necessary for temporary occupation during works of construction shall be handed over to the company by the local authorities on condition that the company shall indemnify the owners. 25. The wood and timber necessary for the construction' and work’ng of the navigation service may be cut in the forests of the neigh bouring districts which belong to the State, in accordance with the regulations relating thereto. 26. Subject to any express provisions contained herein, the company shall be subject to all the laws of the Ottoman Empire, now or hereafter imposed upon Ottoman persons and corporations generally, but no law shall be passed dis criminating against the company. 27. The Imperial Ottoman Government under takes generally to take all steps necessary to facilitate the operations of the company. 28. No discrimination of any kind shall be made by the company or required by the Imperial Ottoman Government in respect of goods upon the ground of the domicile, place of business, or nationality of the owner, consignor, or consignee thereof, or of the country of origin, or destination thereof, or nationality or ownership of the vessel in which the goods are carried to or from Ottoman ports. Provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent the company from taking such measures as may be deemed desirable by the Imperial Ottoman Government with respect to goods, of which the owner, consignor, or consignee is [918—11] E14 domiciled, or carries on business in the ten itory of any State, for the time being, at war with the Sublime Porte. Similar discrimination in respect of the towage of vessels and craft is in like manner, and with the like proviso, forbidden. The company shall not make with any shipping company arrangements for through rates for goods to be carried by such shipping company from any foreign place to Basra or to any other place served by the company’s steamers and thence by the company’s steamers to Bagdad or to any other place served by the company’s steamers without immediately extending the benefit of the company’s steamers’ proportion of the through rates to all other shipping companies carrying similar goods under the same conditions between the same places. 29. The company shall, so soon as they have enjoyed a reasonable time in which to acquire experience in working this concession, but not later than six months after the formation of the company, submit to the Imperial Ottoman Government for approval a table showing the minimum service which the company will normally provide, and also the maximum normal charges which the company will impose for the carriage of goods and passengers between places included in such service. If within three months from the date of the submission of such a table no objection thereto shall have been notified to the company by the Imperial Ottoman Government, then the said table shall be deemed to be approved by the Imperial Ottoman Government. If any such objection to the said table shall be raised by the Imperial Ottoman Government and shall not be accepted, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration in manner provided by article 21. Provided that the company can call upon the Imperial Ottoman Government to reduce the minimum service indicated in the table if at any time the profits of the company do not suffice for the payment of a dividend of 5 per cent, on the ordinary shares after allowing for depreciation. After the lapse of five years from the fixing by agreement or otherwise of such a table, or of any revision thereo-f, the same shall, at the request of the company, be open to revision from time to time, and any difference arising upon such request shall be determined in like manner and with the like proviso.15 Provided that nothing herein contained, and no failure by the company to adhere to any table for the time being binding upon the company shall be made a ground for in any way detracting from or limiting any of the rights, liberties, authorities, or advantages granted by this con cession, but shall only give the right to the Imperial Ottoman Government to claim a penalty as provided in article 30. In so far as journeys undertaken on official duty are concerned, the conveyance of state officials, of officers and men, both naval and military, travelling alone or in a body, whether in time of peace or of war, shall be effected at a reduction of 50 per cent, on the ordinary rates in force. The conveyance of prisoners and convicts shall be effected at a similar reduction. The transport of war material and stores shall be effected at a reduction of 15 per cent, on the ordinary rates in force. In consideration of these reduced rates, and without prejudice to paragraph 2 of article 2, the Imperial Ottoman Government will make use exclusively of the vessels and craft of the company for the conveyance and transport in question, except in cases when, either on account of urgency or for some other reason, the company is not in a position to provide the service required by previous notification from the local authorities, civil or military. 30. In ease of failure by the company to adhere to the table (if any) fixed under article 29, for the time being binding upon the company, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall be entitled to give notice in writing to the company contain ing full particulars of the failure alleged, and requiring the company to adhere to the said table. If after the receipt of such notice the company shall wilfully persist in such failure for a period of not less than six months, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall have the right to claim a penalty not exceeding 5 per cent, of the net profits earned by the company during any year in which such failure shall continue after the expiration of the said six months. In no case can more than one penalty be claimed m respect of any one year. The right to such a penalty shall, if disputed by the company, &gt;e determined by an arbitrator in manner provided by article 21, and such arbitrator shall have anT6 absolute discretion as to the amount of the fine to he awarded subject to the limit herein provided. 31. Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore provided, and as a measure preliminary to the formation of the company and transfer of this concession to the company, the concessionnaire shall, upon furnishing the guarantee hereinafter mentioned, be entitled at any time, upon giving one month’s notice, to call upon the Imperial Ottoman Government to transfer to him all or any of the several items of property included in Part I of the second schedule, and also the benefit of such of the contracts enumerated in Part II of the same schedule as the concessionnaire shall elect to be so transferred, and also all the interests of the Imperial Ottoman Government in the navigation and other rights which are the subject of this concession, and to exercise by himself or his agents all jthe rights, liberties, and authorities hereby granted, and generally to carry on the said navigation and do all such acts incident thereto as he may in his absolute discretion think fit, subject to the reservations hereinbefore made for the protection of Messrs. Lynch and the Bagdad Railway Company, and the Imperial Ottoman Government shall, on or before the expiration of the said notice, transfer the said pro perty and rights to the concessionnaire accordingly. The guarantee above mentioned shall be that of the London agency of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, and shall be for the amount and in the form of the draft guarantee, which, for the purpose of identification, has been initialled by his Excellency Hakki Pasha and the concession naire. Provided that in the event of the concession naire exercising the right to take over the said property and rights prior to the incorporation of the company the company shall, as soon as possible after its incorporation (in addition to complying with the provisions contained in article 3 hereof), (a) adopt and take over all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by the concessionnaire or his agents, and ratify and adopt all acts done by him or them in the exercise, or purported exercise, of the powers hereby granted, (5) indemnify the concessionnaire and his agents against all actions, proceedings, judgments, losses, claims, demands, and expenses whatsoever which he or they may at any time theretofore have suffered, sustained, or incurred,or may at any time thereafter suffer, sustain, or incur, in connection with the exercise, or pur ported exercise, by him or them of the rights, liberties, and authorities hereby granted, and generally with the carrying on of the navigation. And the concessionnaire shall thereupon account to the company for any profit which may have been earned by carrying on the said navigation as aforesaid. 32. The employes and officials of the company shall wear the uniform to be approved and adopted by the Imperial Ottoman Government; they shall, with the exception of the higher officials and officers, be chosen as far as possible from among Ottoman subjects. 33. Works of art and antiquities discovered during the operations of the company shall be subject to the regulations relating thereto. 34. The Imperial Ottoman Government shall be entitled to construct at their own expense entrenchments and works of defence on the banks of the rivers, provided they do not interfere with the navigable condition of the same. 35. The company may instal at its own expense telegraph or telephone wires and posts or a system of wireless telegraphy; it may likewise establish underground telegraph and telephone communications. These wires may follow the course of the rivers, or they may be laid in a direct line between one landing stage and another, as the company may determine ; they may not be used for private correspondence having no connection with the river service. The Imperial Government reserve to themselves the right of control at all times, by inspectors appointed by the Ministry of Posts and Tele graphs, of all telegraphic correspondence carried over the wires of the company. The Government can make use of the poles belonging to the company for the erection of one or, if necessary, two telegraph wires, and the poles of the company shall be erected so that they are capable of supporting these two additional wires, as well as those of the company. In case of need the Government shall have the right, should there be a breakdown or interruption on their own lines, of placing telegraphists in the stations for the transmission of important and urgent official telegrams on the telegraph lines of the company, provided always that? the river servuee is in no way obstructed. [918—11] F18 36. Any difference which may arise between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionnaire or the company, or between the concessionnaire and the company, as to the interpretation or carrying out of this concession shall, subject to the express provisions herein contained, be submitted, at the request of either party concerned, to the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

Foreign Office, : 2 / , 1913 . Reference to previous letter Description of Inclosure. Name and Date. Subject. ' C i2 ]CONFIDENTIAL. v Amended Version. Minute by Mr. Parker. HERR VON KUEHLMANN called to-day to speak to me about the Mesopotamian oil con cession, and before leaving he said he wanted to speak to me about Mr. Lynch. The German Government were rather concerned by the press campaign in Germany against the Tigris navigation concession; they would be quite satisfied if they secured participation to a minor extent, as recently suggested, in the con cession ; but they had to consider public opinion, and they would be very glad if the agitation could be stopped. They were satisfied that the agitation was being carried on principally by Said Ruete, and that Mr. Lynch was behind him, supplying him with facts and ammunition—for of this they had definite proof, which he would indicate presently. Said Ruete had prepared a pamphlet on the navigation question, which he had threatened to publish. The German Government were appre hensive of the result of such publication, for although it Avould not make them modify their attitude in the negotiations with His Majesty’s Government, it might render the proposed Anglo- German agreement unpopular, even if the arguments marshalled by Said Ruete were vulnerable, which he believed would be the case, because public opinion was very ignorant on this subject in Germany, and would with difficulty appreciate the real fact that Germany was not making gratis a tangible' concession to Great Britain. He said that the proof was this : Said Ruete had informed the German Foreign Office that he had ascertained that Herr von Kuehlmann gave the British Foreign Office an assurance, on German Embassy paper, that Germany would forgo all claims to participate in the navigation on the Tigris. This, said Herr von Kuehlmann, clearly re ferred to my conversation with him on [1056]2 May 7, 1913, and he thought that Mr. Lynch had no right to divulge what had been told him evidently in confidence by the British Foreign Office. I said to Herr van Kuehlmann that I agreed : that 1 had had to see Mr. Lynch (with Mr. Maxwell) in the early stages of the nego tiation about the navigation. Mr. Lynch had expressed the- opinion that nothing would induce the Germans to abandon their claim to navigation ; I had replied that I did not think that claim a strong one or one'which could be sustained, but when he had persisted in his view as to the German intention I had told him in strict confidence that we already had such an assurance. It was, I added, necessary that Mr. Lynch should be informed of the position, as it then was, in order that he could consider on its merits an offer His Majesty's Government had put before him with * reference to his participation in the New Ottoman Company. The position had now changed, as the German Government had expressed a wish for participa tion which was under consideration; but Mr. Lynch was most certainly not justified in divulging information which was given to him in strict confidence. Herr von Kuehlmann said that the essential thing now was to make Mr. Lynch stop the agitation which undoubtedly emanated from him,, and to get him to use his influence with Said Ruete in the same direction. He asked if it would not be possible for His Majesty’s Govern ment to tell Mr. Lynch straight out that if the agitation did not cease he himself would be the principal sufferer, by the complete withdrawal of British diplomatic support which would take place. I said that I would submit a report of this conversation to Sir E. Grey, and meanwhile, with Sir L. Mallet’s approval, I have written the following letter to Colonel Picot: — (Private.) Foreign Office, Dear Colonel Picot,. August 20, 1913. I have to-day received information which has much disturbed me, and which is the reason of my asking you to call and see me to-morrow. Said Puete has informed the German Foreign Office that he has been informed that Herr von Kuehlmann gave the British Foreign Office an assurance on German Embassy paper that Germany would forgo all claims to participate in the navigation on the Tigris.The only person in England, outside official circles, who was aware of this was Mr. Lynch, and possibly his manager Mr. Parry, and the information was conveyed to them in confidence by Mr. Maxwell and myself. I do not want to bring Said Euete into the discussion, but I should be glad if you would bring this letter to the immediate attention of Mr. Lynch. Yours sincerely, Alwyn Parker. I will submit a further report after seeing Colonel Picot to-morrow; but I think that, if necessary, we should withdraw all future sup port from Mr. Lynch unless he arrests the mischief which he has created. If he does not do this, the prospects of the whole Anglo-German agreement may suffer. A. P. August 20, 1013. P.S. August 21.—Colonel Picot called and said he had sent my letter on to Mr. Lynch who was in the countryg but he could not believe that Mr. Lynch would maliciously have communicated information which had been given to him in confidence. I pointed out that the words which appeared to justify the language used by Herr von Kuehlmann were “ on German Embassy paper A This certainly, in my view, tended to support the opinion that the indiscretion had emanated from Mr. Lynch. 1 then said that Sir E. Grey had throughout desired to tieat Mr. Lynch fairly, and it was with this object that he had agreed, as the result of a conversation with Lord Ronaldshay, that I should meet Colonel Picot. But I said that it was. quite impossible for negotiations to proceed if the present agitation continued: it would do no good to Mr. Lynch ; it would do no good to British interests in Mesopotamia; it would do no good to Anglo-German relations ; and it might render it necessary for Sir Grey to. make a very complete statement in Parliament as to the causes of such unsatisfactory develop ments. Colonel Picot said that Mr. L}mch had informed him that he was entirely innocent of the press campaign in Germany. I said that I did not wish to enter upon recriminations as to the past, but 1 did believe- that Mr. Lynch’s influence with Said Ruete was. such that he could do a great deal to arrest the present campaign and to check the literary4 i activity of tliat gentleman ; and I felt confident tliat Mr. Lynch would do so from motives of patriotism. Colonel Picot, to whom I gave a copy of this and the preceding minute for his strictly con fidential use, said he would go down to the country to see Mr. Lynch at once, if he was not returning to London. I gave Colonel Picot an assurance that the proposal recently put forward by Mr. Lynch would be examined on its merits, and that Lord Inchcape would be urged, and I was sure would be willing, to do this. But this was of course dependent upon Mr. Lynch undertaking to use his best endeavours to check all agitation. A.

LORD RONALDSHAY called to-day and said he had been authorised by Sir E. Grey to see me with reference to Mr. Lynch’s grievances. Mr. Lynch had asked him to ascertain whether the Foreign Office had any prejudice against him.

Lord Ronaldshay said he realised that the feeling against Mr. Lynch had been as strong in Lord Lansdowne’s time as it was now; that he would advise Mr. Lynch to come to terms on the basis of the 19th May, 1913, memorandum; and that he worn say he could add nothing to what the solicitors had been told already. _ He also said he would cease to support Mr. Lynch s exorbitant claims.

S In May 1903 the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company wrote a long letter in support of certain charges which they had made for the repair of the Ispahan-Ahwaz road, those charges being objected to by the Bakhtiari cine s as excessive. In a memorandum dealing with the company s letter, which he characterised as “of a most unsatisfactory nature, being m Mr. Lynch s worst style, and requiring some plain speaking in its reply,” Sir C. Hardmge dealt with * e , ?“ mts ^ been raised by the company. The memorandum was incorporated in a reply to the company, tbc substance of wbicb was as follows . (a.) The company bad claimed 3,817 krans for expenses incurred by their renresentative on a journey from Aliwaz to Ispahan and back. . . . „ „ , P No mention was made in Messrs. Lynch’s contract with the Bakhtiari chiefs o e 3rd March, 1898, of the chiefs being in any way liable for expense of inspections, t e r only liability being for cost of repairs “ such as the concessionnaires cannot execute themselves” and Carried out under the superintendence of Messrs. Lynch s engineers InYhis case no such repairs were executed, and consequently no valid claim could be m ( a M'The company maintained a claim for 8,5001. for construction of the bridges and According to the contract of March 1898 Messrs. Lynch undertook to execute the works for a sum not exceeding 5,5001, a figure agreed to by Messrs. Lynch themselves and afterwards communicated by their agent to the Bakhtiari chiefs. Under t o [2985 y —2] (: -L% * . ’On*..2 circumstances the refusal of the chiefs to pay the instalments and interest computed on the basis of the higher initial outlay was intelligible, and His Majesty’s Government t ■% • . • * * 2- -»-» -»-n s-\ v-\ 4- V» /~v ■'fTT /~\i -* 1 /-I 2 A 1 could not assist in any way in pressing the claim upon them. IS'or would it be possible for His Majesty’s Government to press for interest at the rate of 12 per cent, on the arrears, since, under the terms of the contract, the chiefs agreed to pay Messrs. Lynch 6 per cent, per annum on their outlay. (To Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, 15 May, 1903). In June 1906 Mr. Lynch wrote privately to. Sir E. Grey, enclosing a copy of a letter which he had addressed to Mr. Morley (then Secretary of State for India) proposing that steps should be taken jointly by the Foreign Office and the India Office to furnish, through the Persian Transport Company, money for a loan to the Bakhtiari chiefs, Sir C. Hardinge minuted the letter, “ Mr. Morley has evidently treated Mr. Lynch’s letter with the contempt it deserves, since nothing is known of it in the Political Department of the India Office. Colonel Picot called on me on Thursday, and I told him that there could be no question of this Department doing anything to facilitate a loan of 8,0001 to the Bakhtiari chiefs to squander as they please. There is no end to Mr. Lynch’s demands. Only three years ago we paid him 4,0001 to start the Transport Company, and now more is wanted of us.” (18823, Pile 2479/06). In sending home an account of a meeting which he and Mr. Malleson (Messrs. Lynch’s agent at Tehran) had had with the Bakhtiari khans, for the purpose of dis cussing various questions connected with the Ispahan-Ahwaz road, Mr. E. Grant Duff (see his No. 131, Confidential, of the 20th May, 1906), made the following statements:— “ I regret to say that the chiefs made no secret of their dislike of Messrs. Lynch.” “He” (Sardar Assad, who acted as spokesman for the chiefs) “maintains that the accounts of the road given to His Majesty’s Government by Messrs. Lynch are exaggerated.” “I wish clearly to bring out the fact that the Bakhtiaris, rightly or wrongly, distrust Messrs. Lynch.” “ But they fairly loathe Messrs. Lynch.” Sir C. Hardinge’s comment on the despatch was: “Unfortunately Messrs. Lynch have made themselves thoroughly detested by the Bakhtiari chiefs by their exorbitant demands.” (19,817, File 2479/06). On a paper dealing with the proposed visit of two Bakhtiari chiefs (Haji Ali Kuli Khan and Haji Ivhosru Khan) to Europe in 1907, Sir C. Hardinge wrote, “ When I was in Tehran 1896-8 the Bakhtiari chiefs were in very close relations with the British Legation and Hadji Ali Guli Khan was a firm believer in everybody that was English. Thanks to Mr. Lynch all this has been changed and the legation is now no longer in touch with the chiefs.” (3615, File 2209/07). In March 1908 the Persian Transport Company wrote, “ We are not aw r are of any personal ill-will on the part of the chiefs against the directors of this company, except in so far as Haji Ali Kuli Khan may have a grievance in the matter of certain loans desired by him in 1901 and 1906.” Mr. Norman’s comment on that was : “ The company may not be aware of any ill-will on the part of the khans towards any individual directors, but we know that the khans hate Mr. Lynch.” (9757, File 5422/08).

For the purpose of fixing the amount of the initial share capital to be paid up, so as to meet the requirements of the company, the directors may make such provision as to the amount to be paid up on the shares issued to British subjects as they may think fit, and may thereafter make such provisions as to calling foi further payments in respect of such shares as they may from time to time think fit. 16. At a date (hereinafter referred to as the date of transfer). to be subsequently determined between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionnaire but not, except with the consent of the concessionnaire, to be more than two calendar months after the date of the forma tion of the company, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall transfer to the company, free of all mortgages, charges, liens, or other incumbrances :— (a.) The property in which the Imperial Ottoman Government possesses any right or interest enumerated in the first part of the second schedule hereto. ( 6 .)

Upon the signature of this concession the Imperial Ottoman Government and the conces-11 sionnaire shall forthwith severally nominate an agent, and the agents so nominated shad prepare in conjunction a detailed list (herein referred to as List (A)) of the items of property included in Part I of the second schedule, and also a list (herein referred to as List (B)) of other property of the Imperial Ottoman Government employed in the business of navigation on the waters de fined in article 9 which the Imperial Ottoman Government is willino; to transfer, but is not included in Part I of the said schedule, and also, so far as is possible, having regard to the fact that the date of transfer may not be determined, a list (herein referred to as List (C)) of the con tracts included in Part II of the said schedule, with full particulars as to the terms thereof, Any corrections in the last-mentioned list shall from time to time be communicated to the concession- naire’s agent. Not less than one month before the date fixed as the date of transfer the conces- sionnaire shall communicate to the Imperial Ottoman Government the items of property- included in List (B), which he desires to be transferred to the company, and the contracts included in List (C), the benefit of which he desires to be transferred to the company. 18. The consideration to be given to the Imperial Ottoman Government for the transfer of the property in List (A), and the property in List (B), which the concessionnaire elects to be trans ferred as aforesaid, shall be the fair value thereof, to be satisfied as provided in article 19. Such value shall not include any enhancement of value which might be attributed to them by reason of the existence of any good-will attaching to the navigation business now carried on by the Imperial Ottoman Government, or by reason of any exclusive rights granted to, or any obligations imposed upon, the company. In case of failure to a^ree the said value the same shall be determined as provided in art'.cle 21 . 19. The said consideration shall be satisfied by the allotment to a nominee or nominees of the Imperial Ottoman Government of shares in the company issued as fully paid, the nominal value of which shall be equal to the value determined in accordance with the provisions of article 18, and the amount of such consideration shall consti tute the Ottoman one-half of the share capital referred to in article 15. 20 . The consideration for the transfer of the12 benefit of the contracts included in List (0), which the concessionnaire shall elect to he trans ferred shall be the undertaking by the company to perform the reciprocal obligations which would otherwise have to be performed in respect thereof by the Imperial Ottoman Government, such obli gation being apportioned when necessary, so that the ratio of the obligation to be undertaken by the company to the whole obligation originally undertaken by the Imperial Ottoman Government shall' be equal to the ratio of the benefit trans ferred to the company to the whole benefit originally secured to the Imperial Ottoman Government in accordance with the terms of the contract. 21 . In case of failure to agree as to the apportionment of such contracts, or as to the value of the properties to be transferred as afore said any difference shall be determined by an arbitrator to be mutually agreed by the company and the Imperial Ottoman Government, and failing agreement to be selected by the President of the Court of Appeal at Paris. 22 . The fact that such difference may not have been determined at the date of transfer shall not be a reason for postponing the transfer, and the consideration for the transfer shall be secured by the issue of shares or by the issue of shares and the deposit, in a bank to be agreed upon, of cash or securities to the amount claimed, as the value of the property transferred by the Imperial Ottoman Government, and the Imperial Ottoman Government shall undertake that in the event of the value as determined by the arbitrator being- less than the nominal value of the shares so issued, to subscribe in cash for the excess of shares allotted. 23. The company may, so far as they deem it necessary or desirable for the purposes of their undertaking, construct and open upon land required by them, docks, wharves, piers, landing- stages, slipways, beacons, warehouses, workshops, depots, and the like, which may be kept private or opened to the public upon such terms as the company may determine. Provided that nothing herein contained shall detract from the rights conferred on the Bagdad Railway Company by article 23 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903 (February 20 th, 1318), which rights are fully reserved.I 13 24. The enterprise being of public utility, land from time to time required by the company for the construction of docks, wharves, piers, landing stages, slipways, beacons, warehouses, workshops, depots, and the like, or lands otherwise required for the purposes of the company’s undertaking, belonging to private persons, shall be taken over in accordance with the law in expropriation, whenever it has not proved possible to come to an understanding between the company and the owners for the purchase of such land. The Imperial Ottoman Government shall expropriate and hand over to the company the land so required and everything appertaining thereto. If any part of the land so required belongs to the Imperial Ottoman Government and is unoccupied, it shall be handed over free of charge to the company. Land necessary for temporary occupation during works of construction shall be handed over to the company by the local authorities on condition that the company shall indemnify the owners. 25. The wood and timber necessary for the construction and working of the navigation service may be cut in the forests of the neigh bouring districts which belong to the State, in accordance with the regulations relating thereto. 26. Subject to any express provisions contained herein, the company shall be subject to all the laws of the Ottoman Empire, now or hereafter imposed upon Ottoman persons and corporations generally, but no law shall be passed dis criminating against the company. 27. The Imperial Ottoman Government under takes generally to take all steps necessary to facilitate the operations of the compan}^. 28. No discrimination of any kind shall be made by the company or required by the Imperial Ottoman Government in respect of goods upon the ground of the domicile, place of business, or nationality of the owner, consignor, or consignee thereof, or of the country of origin, or destination thereof, or nationality or ownership of the vessel in which the goods are carried to or from Ottoman ports. Provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent the company from taking such measures as may be deemed desirable by the Imperial Ottoman Government with respect to goods, of which the owner, consignor, or consignee is [918—11] E. .. .. . - - —~ 14 domiciled, or carries on business in the territory of any State, for the time being, at war with the Sublime Porte. Similar discrimination in respect of the towage of vessels and craft is in like manner, and with the like proviso, forbidden. The company shall not make with any shipping company arrangements for through rates for goods to be carried by such shipping company from any foreign place to Basra or to any other place served by the company’s steamers and thence by the company’s steamers to Bagdad or to any other place served by the company’s steamers without immediately extending the benefit of the company s steamers’ proportion of the through rates to all other shipping companies carrying similar goods under the same conditions between the same places. 29. The company shall, so soon as they have enjoyed a reasonable time in which to acquire experience in working this concession, but not later than six months after the formation of the company, submit to the Imperial Ottoman Government for approval a table showing the minimum service which the company will normally provide, and also the maximum normal charges which the company will impose for the carriage of goods and passengers between places included in such service. If within three months from the date of the submission of such a table no objection thereto shall have been notified to the company by the Imperial Ottoman Government, then the said table shall be deemed to be approved by the Imperial Ottoman Government. If any such objection to the said table shall be raised by the Imperial Ottoman Government and shall not be accepted, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration in manner provided by article 21 . Provided that the company can call upon the Imperial Ottoman Government to reduce the minimum service indicated in the table if at any time the profits of the company do not suffice for the payment of a dividend of 5 per cent, on the ordinary shares after allowing for depreciation. After the lapse of five years from the fixing by agreement or otherwise of such a table, or of any revision thereof, the same shall, at the request of the company, be open to revision from time to time, and any difference arising upon such request shall be determined in like manner and with the like proviso.15 Provided that nothing herein contained, and no failure by the company to adhere to any table for the time being binding upon the company shall be made a ground for in any way detracting from or limiting any of the rights, liberties, authorities, or advantages granted by this con cession, but shall only give the right to the Imperial Ottoman Government to claim a penalty as provided in article 30.

In consideration of these reduced rates, and without prejudice to paragraph 2 of article 2, the Imperial Ottoman Government will make use exclusively of the vessels and craft of the company for the conveyance and transport in question, except in cases when, either on account of urgency or for some other reason, the company is not in a position to provide the service required by previous notification from the local authorities, civil or military. 30. In case of failure by the company to adhere to the table (if any) fixed under article 29, for the time being binding upon the company, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall be entitled to give notice in writing to the company contain ing full particulars of the failure alleged, and requiring the company to adhere to the said table. If after the receipt of such notice the company shall wilfully persist in such failure for a period of not less than six months, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall have the right to claim a penalty not exceeding 5 per cent, of the net profits earned by the company during any year in which such failure shall continue after the expiration of the said six months. In no case can more than one penalty be claimed in respect of any one year. The right to such a penalty shall, if disputed by the company, be determined by an arbitrator m manner provided by article 21 , and such arbitrator shall have an16 absolute discretion as to the amount of the fine to be awarded subject to the limit herein provided. 31.

Lynch and the Bagdad Bailway Company, and the Imperial Ottoman Government shall, on or before the expiration of the said notice, transfer the said pio- perty and rights to the concessionnaire accordingly. The guarantee above mentioned shall be that of the London agency of- the Imperial Ottoman Bank, and shall be for the amount and in the form of the draft guarantee, which, for the purpose of identification, has been initialled by his Excellency Hakki Pasha and the concession naire. Provided that in the event of the concession naire exercising the right to take over the said property and rights prior to the incorporation of the company the company shall, as soon as possible after its incorporation (in addition to complying with the provisions contained in article 3 hereof), (a) adopt and take over all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by the concessionnaire or his agents, and ratify and adopt all acts done by him or them in the exercise, or purported exercise, of the powers hereby granted, (b) indemnify the concessionnaire and his agents against all actions, proceedings, judgments, losses, claims, demands, and expenses whatsoever which he or they may at any time theretofore have suffered, sustained, or incurred,17 or may at any time thereafter suffer, sustain, or incur, in connection with the exercise, or pur ported exercise, by him or them of the rights, liberties, and authorities hereby granted, and generally with the carrying on of the navigation. And the concessionnaire shall thereupon account to the company for any profit which may have been earned by carrying on the said navigation as aforesaid. 32. The employes and officials of the company shall wear the uniform to be approved and adopted by the Imperial Ottoman Government; they shall, with the exception of the higher officials and officers, be chosen as far as possible from among Ottoman subjects. 33. Works of art and antiquities discovered during the operations of the company shall be subject to the regulations relating thereto. 34. The Imperial Ottoman Government shall be entitled to construct at their own expense entrenchments and works of defence on the banks of the rivers, provided they do not interfere with the navigable condition of the same. 35. The company may instal at its own expense telegraph or telephone wires and posts or a system of wireless telegraphy; it may likewise establish underground telegraph and telephone communications. These wires may follow the course of the rivers, or they may be laid in a direct line between one landing stage and another, as the company may determine; they may not be used for private correspondence having no connection with the river service. The Imperial Government reserve to themselves the right of control at all times, by inspectors appointed by the Ministry of Posts and Tele graphs, of all telegraphic correspondence carried over the wires of the company. The Government can make use of the poles belonging to the company for the erection of one or, if necessary, two telegraph wires, and the poles of the company shall be erected so that they are capable of supporting these two additional wires, as well as those of the company. In case of need the Government shall have the right, should there be a breakdown or interruption on their own lines, of placing telegraphists in the stations for the transmission of important and urgent official telegrams on the telegraph lines of the company, provided always that the river service is in no way obstructed.

Sir:- 662) We teg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of / n the 22nd July and regret that owing to an oversight it was not acknowledged before. We have seen Lord Inchcape's Solicitors and have put before them our suggestions both with regard to re presentation on the Board and with regard to local management both of which, on the basis of the Foreign Office Memorandum of May 19th 1913 we consider are open to discussion. We have not received any assurance from Lord Inch- cape’s Solicitors that he will discuss these two points with Mr. Lynch and until such assurance is received we consider that a meeting between Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch would be useless. We are &amp;c., (Signed) Slaughter and May. le Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.In accordance with Sir E. Orey’fl inBtructionB I etaw Colonel Picot to-day. He called on behalf of Hr. Lynch and said that, without prejudice to the memorandum of May 19th, ha wlBhed to make entirely fresh proposals in the hope of arriving at a settlement satisfactory to both sides; the proposals, which are explained in the attached memorandum, amount to an offer to Lord Inchcape of one half of the management (which is the most lucrative part of the undertaking) of the Euphrates and Tigris Company, and the offer to Mr. Lynch of something less than one half of the British share-capital of the new Ottoman Company, and of one half of the management of the new Ottoman Company. The two companies would still exist as independent bodies, but there would be a firm, appolnt- ect ad hoc , to manage the two companies in London and in the East. This managing firm 'would represent, as to 50? Lord Inchcape, and 50 Mr. Lynch: in other words they would be equal partners. I asked Colonel Picot what would happen if there were disagreement between the two groups in the managing firm. He replied that the business routine of management wouldwould be bo simple, concerned as it would be merely with officials and accounts, that there would be little if any possibility of disagreement, and means could be devised beforehand of overcoming such possibility of disagreement. Colonel Picot represented that this was a liberal proposal and made in no huckstering spirit. He hoped that it would receive the Foreign Office imprimatur and that it would be sent on to Lord Inchcape with a recommendation from Sir E. Grey that negotiations should be opened on this ground, in order that matters of detail might be thoroughly thrashed out. 1 said to Colonel Picot that the proposal would he examined at the Board of Trade and submitted to Lord Inchcape, but I could express no opinion as to its merits. I hoped, however, that it might afford a basis for a settlement, as His Majesty's Government were anxious that a settlement, acceptable to both sides, should if possible be reached. I said that Lord Inchcape was in Sutherland till the end of September, and I expressed the hope that, when negotiations were begun. Colonel Picot himself should represent Mr. Lynch. ColonelColonel Pi cot Bald that it seemed desirable to reach an early settlement, and he enquired if Lord Inchcape would be indisposed to appoint someone to carry on the detailed negotiations in London. I said that I would enquire. I gave a copy of this minute to Colonel Plcot, and he said it accurately represented what had been said. (Initialled) A.P. August 15th, 1915.r /j 9 v\juSl*ASd - In order to make quite clear the proposal which will follow, it must be borne in mind that companies of this character are governed by a Board ox directors, and are locally managed by agents, who take commissions on tne earnings of the company, supplying in return the requisite local staff, etc., and giving the company the benefit of any commercial connexions which they may possess. The word, 'management' used below’ applies to such local agents. We contend that, in view of the lengthy negotiations which, with the full support and approval of the Foreign Office, we have undertaken during recent years for the purpose of obtaining control over the Turkish steamers, we are entitled to be now given such control with the management. I should, however, be prepared, provided always that the German Government can oe pursuaded to acquiesce in the creation of the monopoly which, 1 under stand , is not to bo created without their consent, to recommend to rny colleagues tnat we should snare witn Lord Inohcape the management of the new Ottoman Company, andthat 4 © should also snare with him, in future, the ■ uananjoLient of the Brit ion sbeaunera. A separate organiza tion would be created for the management of both concerns, both in London and in the uast. fhis organization would take the form of a new firm, distinct from the firm of Lord Inchcape and from, nj firm., and Lord Inchcane and his friends and 1 : 17 self and my friends 'would 00 equal partners in. the new firm. Great ©con 01:17 would thus 0 © ensured in tmo administration of ode two steamship services on one Ltris whicii, thougii tney would rtwadn distinct, would be managed by the same firm. for instance, instead ox two hitihly-peid ’.onagers, with their durouean. and native staffs, the one cxkdnistorimr. t. e mo--- dirkis;.... Coi.ipany and oh© other tlie ritish C omnr.vy, t‘ sro would in future 00 only one such wii&amp;cvr ana staff for trie too services. in® same would o.voly to Jiondon. All the commissions for the management of both lines of steamers would be taken by tue one firm, in which Lord Inc:ica;oe and his friends would have a on©-naif sna vre. Besides securing economy in administration, this promo sal would go far towards protecting to© interests of * the iritisu Ccffinaay. The am mnaeing fins would have at noartheart the interests of the British Company, since they would taka all the comnussions arising out of its management. If the British Company are to be restricted in the future to the use of three steamers, their only hope of sharing in the traffic, as it expands, will lie in participa tion in the new Ottoman Company. But it is also essential that they should have an effective voice in the new Company. - ,„i rT ,.| l , n „ Equitably, they have established their claim to controlling it. If this claim is not to be satisfied, I should be prepared, as part of the proposal, to recommend that they should agree to accent such proportion ox the share capital of the new Company as would be compatible with the exercise of control by Lord Inchcape. Representation on the Board of the Turkish Company would be equal, as between Lord Inchcape and the British Company, subject to the casting vote remaining in Lord Inchcape’s hands. It is obvious that this proposal is very favourable for Lord Inchcape. He, a stranger to the navigation, obtains more than one-half of the British share in the capital of the new Ottoman Company and one-half of the com missions from its anagement. He also obtains one-half of thethe comraissions in the mnagement of the present British Company. lie is thus endowed with a very eonsideraDle new source of income. (Signed) H. F. B.

ENCLOSED is a copy of some extracts from the article shown me yesterday by NEGOTIATIONS are known to have been in progress for some time past between the British Government and Turkey on the one hand, and this country and Germany on the other, with a view to adjusting the complex set of questions in connection with the Bagdad Railway scheme and the navigation of the rivers of Lower Mesopotamia. * # # # # * Steam navigation in Mesopotamia has been so far limited to the River Tigris between Bagdad, Basra, and the Gulf, and dates back to 1862, when the firm of Lynch commenced a regular service. Virtually, that firm, trading as the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, has so far enjoyed a monopoly, for, with the exception of a few steamers owned by the Turkish Government, through an undertaking styled, if When, in 1901, the project of building a trans-continental railway from the capital across Asia Minor bo Bagdad and the Persian Gulf first assumed practical shape by the granting of a definite concession to the Anatolian Railway Company, an undertaking of overwhelminglv German character, and backed by the Deutsche Bank, the shipping interests established in Mesopotamia naturally grew uneasy, and, according to Sir Edward Grey, a first attempt was made at the time by the British India Steam Navigation Company, which maintains regular services between the Gulf, India, and this country, to obtain control of the Turkish-owned boats on the Tigris, mainly, no doubt, to forestall the railway competition but also, probably, to break the monopoly of the Lynch interests. The advances from this quarter, made with the knowledge and support of the Foreign Office, continued until 1909, when it came to the knowledge of the then chairman of the British India Steam Navigation Company (the late Sir George Mackenzie) that the Lynch group were negotiating independently with the Ottoman Government for the fusion of' the two steamship concerns on the river. y On the advice of the Foreign Office, the British India Steam Navigation Company thereupon withdrew, and negotiations between the Lynch Company, now backed by the British Government, and the Turkish interests continued until Midsummer, 1910, when they came to a standstill, owing to the refusal of the Turkish Government to support the scheme financially. Matters now appear to have remained in abeyance until last year, when the Lynch group, bereft of Foreign Office support, came to an I have told Sir George Paish that having regard to the standing of the “ Statist,’' and to the fact that difficult and delicate negotiations are now proceeding affecting the matters referred to, the publication of this article in his Journal would, in my judgment, be distinctly mischievous.

Extracts from the Manuscript of an Article entitled : “ British Policy in the Gulf.” (Said to be written and presented for publication by “ A British Merchant.”) (Secret.) the present writer remembers rightly, the Haraidieh Line, no competition worth speaking of existed. agreement with the Deutsche Bank, the promoter of the Bagdad Railway. Under the [2985 hh —1]2 said agreement a joint company—the Societe des Transports fluviaux—was formed under Belgian law, and it was arranged that this company, probably as official justifi cation of its existence, should be entrusted with the up-river transport of the material for the railway construction. At the same time the British India Steam Navigation Company once more enterea the field under the auspices of the Foreign Office, whose nominee on the board Lord Inchcape (formerly Mr. Mackay) became chairman and managing director. Al' At' ji*. •Tv* 'Tv* 'Tv* '/V* According to Sir Edward Grey, there is no intention whatsoever on the part of the Foreign Office to favour any individual firm, it being rather intended to protect British interests as a whole. Thus, Messrs. Lynch will continue to enjoy the same privileges and rights as the newcomer, the new Anglo-Turkish undertaking which it is proposed to form, or what in practice amounts to the same, the British India Steam Navigation Company; but, in point of fact, and this in spite of the support the latter group is admittedly enjoying from the Foreign Office, Messrs. Lynch would be in a far more favourable position, but not, as Sir Edward Grey wants us to believe, as a British undertaking but as a close ally of the very interests the negotiations with Germany are supposed to eliminate from the river business. We have seen above that the Belgian Society des Transports fluviaux was formed by Messrs. Lynch and the Deutsche ifank to^ carry up-river the building material requisite for the railway. Thus, while the railway is in course of construction and does not enter as a competing factor, working agreement between Lynch and the Deutsche Bank is assured. What, then, is likely to happen when railhead reaches Bagdad and therewith the river ? Can it be hoped that Mr. Lynch, who has been known to hold rather independent political views in his capacity of chairman of the Persian Committee, and has not always fallen into line with Foreign Office politics and tactics, will terminate that valuable alliance in order to comply with the provisions of the Anglo-German agreement? We are rather inclined to doubt it, and, in fact, recent events seem to point the other way. But if the Manchester Guardian ’ is to be relied upon, Herr von Guinner’s recent visit to this oountry had for its object the formation of an Anglo-German—Turkish company, presumably to take over the business of the Society des Transports fluviaux, who then could fall in with the treaty clause precluding from the river any but British interests. We should thus have on the British side the British India Steam Navigation Company serving the Gulf littoral, and its offspring, the Anglo-Turkish Biver Company, which is to act as feeder to the parent undertaking. So far its fleet is limited to a tew obsolete vessels taken over from the Turks, and its importance as a traffic factor on the river is practically nil. We shall have on the German side the new combine duly registered in England to evade the treaty clause, a working alliance with Mr. Lynch’s own fleet, the long •experience of its chairman of river traffic in a difficult and backward country, and behind them all the financial resources of an institution of the standing of the Deutsche Bank. Beyond Bagdad the river depth is insufficient for large vessels. Thus this city is bound to become an important port of transhipment for the products of Upper esopo an d lesser Armenia bound southwards and for European goods bound ? or • 10 W1 'l benefit^ by this state ol things—the railway and its allied river in eres s serving the entire country north and south, west and east, or the new ri isi naviga ion company entirely dependent on the state of an unharnessed and erratic river ? — *7?' TT w - 11 X er y, l^tle is known at present of the trend of the pourparlers between the 'f V, 6 r? 8 ras . se an th® Boreign Office, but one fact stands out undisputed, viz., that if it has been intended by British policy to confine German activity in the Gulf to the lai way it las failed lamentably. It would be premature to accuse the Government of urnin &amp; a se to i s own professed policy, but on the face of it the exclusion of the i^yncii group m favour of a party in close contact with official circles, thus forcing the mer o com me with the very element that should have been kept out, will, unless we are very much mistaken, be levelled as a gross fault of judgment at the Government n rlTr • t 1 he / aCt - be ° ome P ubllc Property.

CONEIDENTIAL. [July 28.] Section 2&lt; [34622] No. 1. Earl Granville to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 28.) (No. 269.) Sir, Berlin, July 25, 1913. WITH reference to my despatch No. 261 of the 18th instant, I have the honour to report that the “ Frankfort Gazette ” has published in the last two days a letter and a telegram from its London correspondent, and a long leading article on the subject of the Bagdad Railway and the Tigris navigation. In his letter of the 21st instant the London correspondent, after saying that there seemed to he a hitch in the Anglo-German-Turkish negotiations, and that it was very difficult to discover anything on the subject in London, remarked that the continuation of the Bagdad Railway to the sea had no longer the same political and^ military importance for England as before owing to her having established a firm position in the districts north and north-west of India, and owing to her having at last, after so many years, succeeded in making use of Turkey’s downfall in Europe to secure official Turkish recognition of her supremacy in the Persian Gulf. After the failure of the “ Deutsche Bank ” in 1903 to obtain the assistance of English capital for the Bagdad Railway, owing to the opposition of Lord Lansdowne and the I oreign Office, the construction of the railway to Bagdad was financed by Germany alone, and the continuation to Basra was postponed. Now the latter plan had come to the front again, partly owing to the improvement of Anglo-German relations, and partly, no doubt, because Germany was excited by the Turkish concessions to England in the Persian Gulf, and wanted hastily to score some sort of success. The writer expressed considerable doubts as to whether the right to build the line to Basra alone was really | very valuable: Germany already held some 25,000,000L of Turkish bonds, and the building of the line to Basra would mean raising 6£ millions more, which did not seem particularly desirable, as the last German loans had not been exactly a striking success. The line to Basra was of practically no political importance, and of very doubtful commercial and financial promise, and the only real gain would be the profits which the “ Deutsche Bank ” would make out of the building in a much easier country than that hitherto traversed. That was why the report that Germany had renounced all claims to participation in the navigation of the Tigris in return for the Bagdad—Basra concession was received so unfavourably in Germany. Herr von Jagow had assured the Reichstag that Germany had not renounced her claims “ for ever, but comparatively few years came to the same thing as “ for ever” in matters of this^ sort. Jhe writer ended by urging that Germany ought not to allow England to obtain such a position that she might be able in time effectually to crush German trade in those parts. On the 23rd the same correspondent telegraphed a report of Lord Ronald shay’s questions and your answers in the House of Commons on the 22nd, pointed out that Herr von Jagow’s denial of German renunciation “ for ever meant apparently that she had renounced for sixty years, which really came to exactly the same thing, and remarked that His Majesty’s Government, in neglecting Mr. Lynch and obtaining a monopoly for Lord Inchcape were evidently giving a concession of enormous value to a man who, they thought, would be more subservient and less inconvenient than Mr. Lynch, who, as chairman of the Persia Committee, was constantly giving them a great deal of trouble. _ The leading article of yesterday began by pointing out that durkey s downfall in Europe had brought the problems of Asiatic Turkey much nearer practical politics, and that Germany must devote more attention than ever to her interests in that country. Consequently, the article said, Germans were waiting with the greatest interest for the results of the pending negotiations. The desire had been expressed on both sides of the North Sea to solve the Mesopotamian problems, not only in regard to the problems themselves, but also with a view to a thorough “cleaning up of Anglo-German relations. If this desire should be realised it would be greeted with the greatest pleasure in both countries, but at present it was not known how far or how [2985 ee—2] 8 AUG 1913near it was to success, and it was obvious that delicate negotiations of this nature could not be prematurely disclosed. The English protectorate over Koweit, which had now been conceded by Turkey, did not make much difference to German interests, as it had long been discounted! The railway from Basra to Koweit and the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab from Basr^&gt; to the sea were said to have been also conceded to England by Turkey, and, a\ compensation for this, the line from Bagdad to Basra was to be given to the Germans alone. It might be considered doubtful whether this latter concession was a very valuable one, but the Bagdad Railway must obviously reach eventually to the sea, or to the Shatt-el-Arab, and it would have been very undesirable to leave that final section to be built by England, who could have endangered thereby Germany’s claim to a share in the commercial development of Upper Mesopotamia. But in any case the concession of this final section to Germany was certainly not so profitable as to justify the payment for it of any compensation elsewhere, and if it was true that the German Government had purchased the concession by consenting to an English monopoly of navigation on the Tigris, this was one more case of a political business transaction in which Germany’s role was that of being excluded from the transaction. If the German Government tried to argue that Germany had no right to a share in the navigation, and in any case, no right to prevent the grant of a concession to England, the answer was that Germany’s commercial activity in Turkey certainly gave her the moral right to obtain the equal facilities with England on the Tigris, and not to allow herself to be cut off from participation in the development of navigation on that river. The agreement made last year by the “ Deutsche Bank ” with Lynch for the transport •of building material for the Bagdad Railway in itself gave Germany an interest in the navigation of the Tigris, as the vessels built and used for that transport could afterwards be used for ordinary navigation purposes. “But if it is true that we have sold these interests and rights for so doubtful a thing as the railway concession to Basra, it would j be one more instance of a deplorable failure on the part of our diplomacy.” The article concluded by expressing the hope that was still felt that no valuable concessions would be granted to England in Lower Mesopotamia without an equal consideration being shown for German interests in Upper Mesopotamia.

Fo 7 'eign Office, July 21, 1913. [2985 x—2][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA ^ CONFIDENTIAL. [33019] No. 1. Mr. Mortimer to Mr. Parker.—(Received July 18.) Dear Sir, 18, Austin Friars, London, July 17, 1913. REFERRING to my interview with you this afternoon I write to inform you that I have since seen Mr. Lynch with regard to the suggestion that he has been in negotiation with the Turkish Government and with the Germans with a view to preventing the consummation of the negotiations between the Foreign Office and the Turkish Government. You will remember that you went on to say that while any negotiations between the Foreign Office and Mr. Lynch were proceeding all negotiations between him and the Germans must cease. Mr. Lynch informs me that it is absolutely untrue that any negotiations have taken place between himself and the Germans on the subject. Mr. Lynch cannot understand how the suggestion could be put forward in view of the very full and frank way in which he has placed before the Foreign Office everything that has come from the German side. Mr. Lynch’s attention was called yesterday and again to-day by German journalists in London to certain articles which have recently appeared in the German press on the subject of the Tigris navigation, and in particular to two articles, one in the “ Berliner Tageblatt” of the 11th instant and the other in the “Yossische Zeitung ” of the 15th instant. I enclose a translation of the former article. The latter is too long to have copied, but it contains the statement that the Deutsche Bank have placed them selves in communication with Messrs. Lynch on the subject of the navigation of the Tigris. Mr. Lynch informed the journalists above mentioned that he had nothing to say on the subject, and he has telegraphed to the Deutsche Bank asking them what the article in the “ Vossische Zeitung ” (which is the organ of the Deutsche Bank) means, as he has received no communication from them. He has not received a reply. As regards the former article Mr. Lynch can only suppose that the information emanates from the German Embassy in London. It is obvious that the statement that “ the English Lynch Company appears to have nothing to do with the future development of the Tigris navigation ” is extremely prejudicial to the prestige of Mr. Lynch’s company, and Mr. Lynch trusts that the Foreign Office may be so good as to correct this statement by forwarding a denial of the truth of the statement to the German Embassy. Mr. Lynch wishes me to remind you that he pointed out to you when he first discussed the navigation question, that unless some participation in the company were given to the Germans, there would probably be a press campaign in Germany similar to that from which he himself suffered when he was negotiating with the Turkish Government in 1909. As regards the Turkish Government, Mr. Lynch has informed the Turkish Envoy that he was grieved to see that he was negotiating for the grant of a monopolistic concession to a third party, as it would seriously prejudice the position of the present British company on the Tigris. I should feel obliged if you would kindly let me know, if possible, to-morrow morning, whether I am to commence negotiations with Messrs. Waltons and Co. on the basis of Mr. Slaughter’s letter to Sir Louis Mallet of the 16th instant. Yours faithfully, WM. E. MORTIMER. a %.

The Buying-out of German Bights in Morocco by France. (Telegram from our correspondent.) I LEARN from an excellently informed source that the Bagdad negotiations are taking a satisfactory turn. I have been expressly assured that there can be no question of Germany waiving its navigation rights on the Tigris, if only for the reason that she does not possess any such rights. The inland navigation in Mesopotamia is a matter for Turkey, which exercises unlimited sovereign rights in that country. But even if Turkey should form a navigation company there with the aid of an English company, German wishes and interests would be respected in every way, and some form of German participation may safely be reckoned upon. The English Lynch Company, which at present has the monopoly of navigation on the Tigris, appears to have nothing to do with the future development of Tigris navigation. It also seems quite clear that the Bagdad Railway Company is very satisfied with Basra as the terminal of the railway, and does not w r ant to get to Koweit. London, July 9, 1913. Annex. Messrs. Slaughter and May to Sir Louis Mallet. Dear Sir Louis, _ 18, Austin Friars, London, July 16, 1913. MR. LYNCH, who is with me while I write, has shown me Mr. Alwyn Parker’s letter to him of yesterday’s date. I am sorry that I myself, as I told you on Friday last, am obliged to leave England, but I understand that Mr. Parker s kind reference to myself is merely meant to be a reference to myself, or one of my partners in my absence. On this assumption, either Mr. Lynch himself, or my partner Mr. Mortimer, will see Lord Inchcape, and in saying that I am of course understanding that consistently with the terms of the 19th May memorandum there will not be ruled out of the discussion the question of local management and the representation on the Board, and I only refer to these matters so that there may be no misunderstanding between you and me. Oh fi ear ing from you I will communicate with Lord Inchcape and see whether he will prefer to see Mx. Lynch or my partner Mx. IVIortimer. I am sorry to trouble you, but perhaps you would let Lord Inchcape know that he may be expecting a communication from me. Yours faithfully, SLAUGHTER AND MAY. Minutes by Mr. Parker. I telephoned to Mr. Mortimer this morning and told him that Mr. Lynch did not appear to appreciate the exact statement I had made to Mr. Mortimer, and I therefore leac to the latter my record of what I had said (see 32990) with the exception of any re eience to what Sir E. Grey would state in Parliament. I also said, in reply to his • W6 • S ° m ® ^ ays a £° su gg est ed both to Mr. Lynch and to Lord Incheape a eir respective solicitors should enter into negotiations, but that we could not do more, or settle how far a working agreement would cover the question of local manage ment, especially as Sir E. Grey had now said that, in consequence of Mr. Lynch’s cone uc , t e boieign Office were to take no steps to promote a settlement, though they would do nothing to impede one between Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch.I further said that I was quite sure Sir E. Grey would decline to deny to the German Embassy a statement which had appeared about Mr. Lynch’s company in a German newspaper : it was not usual for the Secretary of State to enter into communi cations with foreign representatives respecting newspaper articles, and I was positive no ^exception would be made in this case. ’ A. P. July 18, 1913. Mr. Mortimer, of Messrs. Slaughter and May, has just telephoned to say Mr. Lyneh is very sore that it should be thought that he has been agitating with the Germans and the Turks, and he is at a loss to understand how this can be believed of him in view of the full and frank way he 'has communicated with us in the past in regard to all German proposals made to him : I asked Mr. Mortimer if he thought Mr. Lynch quite a good judge of what “ agitation ” consisted in, and he said he did not know. He said he had now asked for an interview with Lord Inchcape’s solicitors, so as to try and reach a settlement, as he (Mr. Mortimer) could not answer for the j j consequences if Mr. Lynch “ ran loose” as he seemed likely to do if negotiations failed. | | I said the matter now lay between Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch and I hoped further reference to the Foreign Office would not be necessary for some time.

Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, (Limited), to Hakki Pasha .— (Communicated to Foreign Office, July 16.) Your Highness, London, July 15, 1913. MY board has learnt with great regret that you are engaged in negotiating a concession tor the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris, with exclusive rights, with a third party here. You are no doubt aware that, during the Ministry of his Highness, Hussein Hdmi Pasha, this concession w T as given to our Company, and that even the Ottoman Chamber passed a resolution authorising the Cabinet through the competent Department to sign the convention, statues, and “ cahier des charges.” Basing ourselves on this decision of the Chamber, I have the honour to request your Highness, m the name of my board, to conclude the matter above referred to with us. I need scarcely add that, in case the Imperial Ottoman Government should grant this exclusive concession to a third party, this Company would be seriously injured. My board, therefore, cherishes the hope that your Highness will relieve us ol the necessity of asserting our just claims, based upon secular rights, by acceding to our request.

They then said they principally wished to discuss Mr. Lynch*s position in the no/ Company.

As regards Capital and Board . we confined our selves to intimating the improbability of Lord Inchcape agreeing; and promised lo report. As regards the .Agencies we said we knew he would not agree to Lynch and Company being agents at Bagdad or river ports. Mr. Mortimer then suggested that after we have reported to Lore Inchcape, Mr, Lynch and he should meet Lord Inchcape and us for discussion. To this we provisionally assented. But later Mr. Mortimer tele phoned that Mr. Lynch (whom he had seen) suggested meeting Mr. Buchanan rather than Lord Inchcape. To thisthis v/e replied that :e should report; hut that Lord Inchcape being the concessionaire, might well wish to deal with the matter personally. Mr. Mortimer asked no questions, and we gave no information, about the terns of the concession or any matters other than the above.

WE Lave just completed the draft of our reply to your proposals. It was a very long and difficult discussion, particularly because the shipping interest offered a most determined opposition to the monopoly on the rivers. It is all right now, and you will see no important changes from the draft I showed you, except that we claim now 20 per cent, of the whole capital of the Navigation Company to be taken out of the Turkish share, and two directors in the Navigation Company. This is the result of a compromise with the shipping interest, and will be, I am afraid, a conditio sine qua non. The Imperial Chancellor wants me to go back to London to explain verbally our proposals. It is rather hard on me, but I will do it. Please let me know if you will be in London Wednesday next, and if you can give me some time that day. Please wire to Yollmerz station, “ Agree,” if this suits you. I would only come for that day then. Au revoir. Yours very truly, KtTHLMANN. [2985 o—l] rwpv to ^ ilm?' ? ' a l, 1 .

Sir, Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received July 12.) Board of Trade, July 11, 1913. ADVERTING to previous correspondence on the subject of the proposed formation of an Anglo-Ottoman company for the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, I am now directed by the Board of Trade to forward to you the accompanying copy of a letter which has been received from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited) in reply to the letter addressed to the company by the Board on the 30th June. I am also to enclose copy of the further letter which has to-day been sent to the company in acknowledgment of their communication, from which it will be seen that the Board have intimated that further correspondence on this matter should be addressed to your Department A further letter will be sent to you as soon as possible setting out the Board’s views on the enclosed letter from the company, and I am to state that the Board will be glad to be kept informed of any developments of the matter in question as they arise, and to be afforded an opportunity of expressing their views, or of lending any other assistance 'in their power, with regard to any future discussions with the company oT, with Messrs. Lynch. to modify the views expressed in your letter of the l4th ultimo, you do not consider that the occasion has yet arisen to consider either of the alternatives suggested in our letter. As regards the procedure adopted in “hammering out ” the working arrangement, we must repeat that, in our opinion, it has differed in all essential respects from the procedure indicated to us by the Foreign Office. Had we been informed that a concessionnaire had already been appointed and placed in possession of the correspondence we should have confined ourselves to a strong protest against this course. What actually occurred was that we were earnestly invited to discuss with the Board of Trade, who would be assisted by quite independent expert advice from outside, the feasibility of making an arrangement with a prospective concessionnaire which, while leaving him the controlling voice, as desired by the Secretary of State for a reason which was explained to us, would in other respects fully safeguard and satisfy our interests. Though we were well aware of the difficulty of arriving at such an arrangement with the above-mentioned condition attached, we did not feel ourselves justified in rejecting such a request, couched as it was in the most conciliatory and before us without reserve. The third and fourth paragraphs of your letter under acknowledgment discuss the past history of our operations, and suggest that we have no reasonable ground for expecting any relaxation of the existing restrictions. On this point you have been misinformed. What are the facts ? Up to the 15th June, 1899, our service was I am, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to Board of Trade. Sir, In reply, I am desired to state that my board take note of the fact that, while unable 3, Salter's Rail Court, Cannon Street, London, July 7, 1913. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo. considerate form. It is quite evident that all the facts were not known to those with whom we negotiated, otherwise we are quite certain that they would have been placed arbitrarily limited to two steamers only, and the cargo with which we were thus able [2985 m—11*2 to deal did not exceed an average annual quantity of 19,000 tons. On that date, as the result of negotiation with the Turkish Government, we were able to increase the space at our disposal by the addition to each steamer of a steel towing barge, almost as large as the steamer herself. The average annual quantity of cargo carried rose to 26,000 tons. In March 1907, following upon further negotiations in the same quarter, A a third steamer was placed upon the run, and the average was brought up from ^ 26,000 tons to 34,000 tons during the three years 1908 to 1910 inclusive. Since May 1911 each steamer has towed two barges whenever it has been found necessary, and I the cargo dealt with annually has reached an average of 51,000 tons. So that within a period of twelve years w T e have succeeded in expanding our resources in such a way as 1 to enable us to cope with almost three times as much cargo as before, and we have done this by negotiation. Why should we not expect, as the trade develops still further, to be able to arrange for further additions to our space ? Of course we expect j to do so. Would it not be unreasonable to ask us to forgo the expectation ? No mention of restrictions was made to this company by our Foreign Office when the situation was explained to us prior to the company’s formation. We have always received the assistance of our Government in combating restrictions, and that on occasions and during periods when the Turkish Government was resisting the introduction of foreign enterprise. At the present day this situation has greatly changed, and it has changed in our favour. On all sides the other European Powers are creating new rights in Turkey. Our own rights date back to a time when Turkey exercised a merely nominal sovereignty over the countries in which our operations have been conducted. We are, therefore, justified in expecting that-, while all these new foreign rights are springing up, the Government of our own country will not be slow 7 in protecting us in the exercise of our old rights and in obtaining the removal of any -unfair restrictions. These reasonable anticipations could never be realised if His Majesty’s Government were to agree to provisions resembling those submitted to \ my directors. They would stereotype our present position, and, as the trade increases, j v’ould place us at the mercy of our unrestricted competitors. The remainder of your letter deals with the proposals of the Secretary of State and the endeavour of my board to give effect to those proposals, as explained in our letter of the 9th ultimo, addressed to yourself. Had we been originally informed that Lord Inchcape’s conditions as regards the local management would have your support, that the local agents would be appointed by him, and that, in addition to the controlling vote at board meetings, his participation in the share capital and directorate of the new company would be considerably greater than ours, we should respectfully have declined to consider the matter further. My board is unanimous in the view expressed to you in our letter of the 20th ultimo, namely, that unless we can be given an effective voice in the direction and management of the new company we are better out of it altogether. Our chairman made our position in this respect quite clear at his first interview with yourself on the 6th May. Since the Secretary of State’s proposals were handed to us on the 19th May we have had some opportunity of judging the effect that is likely to be produced by the substitution of a third party for a nominee of this company as concessionnaire of the new Ottoman company 7 . We have negotiated two conventions with the Turkish Government with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the one leaving our steamers out and the other including them. The first only awaited ratification by the Sultan Abdul Hamid, when he was dethroned. The second v 7 as accepted by the Government of the Young Turks, the’ Chamber authorising the Cabinet by an overwhelming majority to give us the concession. The resolution of the Turkish Chamber is still valid, and only the occasion has been wanting for giving effect to it. That occasion is now forthcoming, and the Turkish Government is apparently willing to return to the principle which governed the first convention. The introduction under such circumstances of a second British concessionnaire to the navigation of the Tigris is scarcely calculated, we have reason to believe, to produce a favourable impression in Turkey ; whole the transference of the results of all our pains and labour for so many years to such other party, who will negotiate our ov r n conventions with the Turkish Government, would appear to be an act so conflicting with the elements of justice that we cannot believe it to be calculated to produce the effect desired in our own country or to be the last word of the Secretary of State. For it is not a question of combating a monopoly but of creating one, and of placing it in the hands of a stranger to the navigation for a period of sixty years, with the single exception of three steamers, wdiich we are to be permitted to retain as a matter of grace. W e therefore ask that we may be allowed ourselves to complete the negotiationof our own convention with the Turkish envoy, subject to any conditions which His Majesty s Government may desire to make, and we shall he happy to allot any reasonable share in the new company to such other participants as His Majesty’s Government may consider it desirable that we should include. While anxious as far f s possible to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government, we submit that it is holly unreasonable to ask us to assume a secondary place in the navigation of these rivers in favour of a stranger. The conventions are our own work, and so are the figures and particulars. It has not been suggested to us that we have done anything to forfeit the confidence of His Majesty’s Government; and we have quite recently secured the construction in this country under our own supervision of all the steamers which the Germans were entitled to place on these rivers under the Bagdad Railway Convention, as well as a half-share for British capital in an enterprise which, but for our efforts, would have been exclusively German. We are willing to give all the guarantees desired by His Majesty’s Government, subject to the satisfaction of what we consider to be the strictly reasonable request which we make. We trust therefore that the necessary communication may forthwith be made to the Turkish envoy, authorising him to negotiate with us, and we shall be glad of an early reply. I have, &amp;c. FRED. W.

It seemed to Lord Inchcape and me that the object aimed at could be secured if the concessionnaire bound himself to His Majesty’s Government by a separate instru ment, in respect of most of the suggested omissions from this article. As to voting by “units” we explained that this was indispensable if the British chairman was to have control, especially if Mr. Lynch were one of the British directors, but Hakki Pasha said he must reserve the point. —A. P. (a.) There shall be a president of the company, who shall so le»g as the 4t»pefial Qtientas htevemmeet shall SO deehe, be an Ottoman subject nominated by the Imperial Ottoman Government. \b.)

(e.) The chairman of the board and also the deputy-chairman shall always be a British approved director. At every meeting of the board the chairman, if present, or in his absence the deputy-chairman, shall preside, and in case of equality of voting at any meeting of the board shall have a casting vote in addition to his ordinary vote as a director. The first chairman of the board shall be the concessionnaire, who shall retain such office during his pleasure.

No share shall be trans ferable otherwise than by a written instrument of transfer registered in the hooks of the company. (k.) The statutes may contain such provisions9 as the concessionnaire shall think fit with respect to the following matters, viz. :— (1.) For regulating the conditions under which (if at all) any corporation shall be permitted to be a shareholder in the company. (2.) For ensuing that no shares in the company shall be held by the holder thereof, directly or indirectly, upon trust for, or for the benefit or account of, or subject to the control of any other person, persons, or corporations whatsoever not expressly approved by the directors, and for enabling the directors to prevent any infringe ment of this provision by compelling a transfer of the shares by the holder, or otherwise as the directors may think fit. 16. The statutes shall further contain provisions for securing, so far as is practicable, that the number of shares allotted by the company at the first allotment shall be allotted 111. equal proportions to Ottoman and British sub jects. For the purpose of fixing the amount of the initial share capital to be paid up, so as to meet the requirements of the company, the directors may make such provision as to the amount to be paid up on the shares issued to British subjects as they may think fit, and may thereafter make such provisions as to calling for further payments in respect of such shares as they may from time to time think fit. 17. At a date (hereinafter referred to as the date of transfer) to be subsequently determined between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionnaire but not, except with the consent of the concessionnaire, to be more than two calender months after the date of the form ation of the company, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall transfer to the company, free of all mortgages, charges, liens, or other incumbrances :— (a.) The property in which the Imperial Ottoman Government possesses any right or interest enumerated in the first part of the second schedule hereto. (b.) Such other property as the concessionnaire shall elect in pursuance of article 18 hereof. (c.) The benefit of such of the contracts enumerated in the second part of the second schedule hereto, as the concessionnaire shall elect to be transferred. [2950 dd—b] D10 All property which is to be transferred by the Imperial Ottoman Government to the company shall be at the risk of the Imperial Ottoman Government until actually transferred to the company. 18. Upon the signature of this concession the Imperial Ottoman Government and the conces- sionnaire shall forthwith severally nominate an agent, and the agents so nominated shall prepare in conjunction a detailed list (herein referred to as List (A)) of the items of property included in Part I of the second schedule, and also a list (herein referred to as List (B)) of other property of the Imperial Ottoman Government employed in the business of navigation on the waters de fined in article 10 which the Imperial Ottoman Government is willing to transfer, but is not included in Part I of the said schedule, and also, so far as is possible, having regard to the fact that the date of transfer may not be determined, a list (herein referred to as List (C) ) of the con tracts included in Part II of the said schedule, with full particulars as to the terms thereof. Any corrections in the last-mentioned list shall from time to time be communicated to the concession- naire’s agent. Not less than one month before the date fixed as the date of transfer the conces- sionnaire shall communicate to the Imperial Ottoman Government the items of property in cluded in List (B), which he desires to be trans ferred to the company, and the contracts included in List (C), the benefit of which he desires to be transferred to the company. 19. The consideration to be given to the Imperial Ottoman Government for the transfer of the property in List (A), and the property in List (B), which the concessionnaire elects to be trans ferred as aforesaid, shall be the fair value thereof, to be satisfied as provided in article 20. Such value shall not include any enhancement of value which might be attributed to them by reason of the existence of any good-will attaching to the navigation business now carried on by the Imperial Ottoman Government, or by reason of any exclusive rights granted to, or any obligations imposed upon, the company. In case of failure to agree the said value the same shall be determined as provided in article 22. 20. The said consideration shall be satisfied by the allotment to a nominee or nominees of the Imperial Ottoman Government of shares in the11 v~ company issued as fully paid, the nominal value of which shall be equal to the value determined in accordance with the provisions of article 19, and the amount of such consideration shall consti tute the Ottoman one-half of the share capital referred to in article 16. -1- The consideration for the transfer of the benefit of the contracts included in List (C), which the concessionnaire shall elect to be trans ferred shall be the undertaking by the company to perform the reciprocal obligations which would otherwise have to be performed in respect thereof by the Imperial Ottoman Government, such obli gation being apportioned when necessary, so that the ratio of the obligation to be undertaken by the company to the whole obligation originally undertaken by the Imperial Ottoman Government shall be equal to the ratio of the benefit trans ferred to the company to the whole benefit originally secured to the Imperial Ottoman Government in accordance with the terms of the contract. 22. [In case of failure to agree as to the apportionment of such contracts, or as to the value of the properties to be transferred as afore said any difference shall be determined by an arbitrator to be mutually agreed by the company and the Imperial Ottoman Government, and failing agreement to be selected by the Imperial Ottoman Government out of four persons nominated by His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment.] 23. The fact that such difference may not have been determined at the date of transfer shall not be a reason for postponing the transfer, and the consideration for the transfer shall be secured by the issue of shares or by the issue of shares and the deposit, in a bank to be agreed upon, of cash or securities to the amount claimed, as the value of the property transferred by the Imperial Ottoman Government, and the Imperial Ottoman Government shall undertake that in the event of the value as determined by the arbitrator being less than the nominal value of the shares so issued, to subscribe in cash for the excess of shares allotted. 24. The company may, so far as they deem it necessary or desirable for the purposes of their undertaking, construct and open upon land required by them, docks, wharves, piers, landing stages, slipways, beacons, warehouses, workshops,12 depots, and the like, which may be kept private or opened to the public upon such terms as the company may determine. Provided that nothing herein contained shall detract from the rights conferred on the Bagdad Railway Company by article 23 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903 (February 20th, 1318), which rights are fully reserved. 25. The enterprise being of public utility, land from time to time required by the company for the construction of docks, wharves, piers, landing- stages, slipways, beacons, warehouses, workshops, depots, and the like, or lands otherwise required for the purposes of the company’s undertaking, belonging to private persons, shall be taken over in accordance with the law in expropriation, whenever it has not proved possible to come to an understanding between the company and the owners for the purchase of such land. The Imperial Ottoman Government shall expropriate and hand over to the company the land so required and everything appertaining thereto. If any part of the land so required belongs to the Imperial Ottoman Government and is unoccupied, it shall be handed over free of charge to the company. Land necessary for temporary occupation during works of construction shall be handed over to the company by the local authorities on condition that the company shall indemnify the owners. 26. The wood and timber necessary for the construction and working of the navigation service may be cut in the forests of the neigh bouring districts which belong to the State, in accordance with the regulations relating thereto. 27. Subject to any express provisions contained herein, the company shall be subject to all the laws of the Ottoman Empire, now or hereafter imposed upon Ottoman persons and corporations generally, but no law shall be passed dis criminating against the company. 28. The Imperial Ottoman Government under takes generally to take all reasonable steps to facilitate the operations of the company. 29. No discrimination of any kind shall be made by the company or required by the Imperial Ottoman Government in respect of goods upon the ground of the domicile, place of business, or nationality of the owner, consignor, or consignee13 thereof, or of the country of origin, or destination thereof, or nationality or ownership of the vessel in which the goods are carried to or from Ottoman ports. Provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent the company from taking such measures as may be deemed desirable by the ©oBapaay Imperial Ottoman Government with respect to goods, of which the owner, consignor, or con signee is domiciled, or carries on business in the territory of any State, for the time being, at war with the Sublime Porte. Similar discrimination in respect of the towage of vessels and craft is in like manner, and with the like proviso, forbidden 30. The company shall, so soon as they have enjoyed a reasonable time in which to acquire experience in working this concession, but not later than six months after the formation of the company, submit to the Imperial Ottoman Government for approval, a table showing the minimum service which the company will normally provide, and also the maximum normal charges which the company will impose for the carriage of goods and passengers between places included in such service. If within three months from the date of the submission of such a table no objection thereto shall have been notified to the company by the Imperial Ottoman Government, then the said table shall be deemed to be approved by the Imperial Ottoman Government. If any such objection to the said table shall be raised by the Imperial Ottoman Government and shall not be accepted, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration [in manner provided by article 22]. Provided that any table shall cease to be binding upon the company, if at any time the profits of the company shall not be sufficient to pay a dividend of at least 6 per cent, upon the ordinary shares. After the lapse of five years from the fixing by agreement or otherwise of such a table, or of any revision thereof, the same shall, at the request of the company, be open to revision from time to time, and any difference arising upon such request shall be determined in like manner and with the like proviso. Provided that nothing herein contained, and no failure by the company to adhere to any table for the time being binding upon the company [2950 dd—5] E14 shall be made a ground for in any way detracting from or limiting any of the rights, liberties, authorities, or advantages granted by this con cession, but shall only give the right to the Imperial Ottoman Goverment to claim a penalty as provided in article 31. 31. In case of failure by the company to adhere to the table (if any) fixed under article 30, for the time being binding upon the company, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall be entitled to give notice in writing to the company contain ing full particulars of the failure alleged, and requiring the company to adhere to the said table. If after the receipt of such notice the company shall wilfully persist in such failure for a period of not less than six months, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall have the right to claim a penalty not exceeding 5 per cent, of the net profits earned by the company during any year in which such failure shall continue after the expiration of the said six months. In no case can more than one penalty be claimed in respect of any one year. The right to such a penalty shall, if disputed by the company, be determined by an arbitrator in manner provided by article 22, and such arbitrator shall have an absolute discretion as to the amount of the fine to be awarded subject to the limit herein provided. 32. Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore provided, and as a measure preliminary to the formation of the company and transfer of this concession to the company, the concessionnaire shall, upon furnishing the guarantee hereinafter mentioned, be entitled at any time, upon giving one month’s notice, to call upon the Imperial Ottoman Government to transfer to him all or any of the several items of property included in Part I of the second schedule, and also the benefit of such of the contracts enumerated in Part II of the same schedule as the concessionnaire shall elect to be so transferred, and also all the interests of the Imperial Ottoman Government in the navigation and other rights which are the subject of this concession, and to exercise by himself or his agents all the rights, liberties, and authorities hereby granted, and generally to carry on the said navigation and do all such acts incident thereto as he may in his absolute discretion think fit, subject to the reservations hereinbefore made for the protection of Messrs. Lynch and the15 % Bagdad Railway Company, and the Imperial Ottoman Government shall, on or before the expiration of the said notice, transfer the said property and rights to the concessionnaire accordingly. Provided that in the event of the concession naire exercising the right to take over the said property and rights prior to the incorporation of the company the company shall, as soon as possible after its incorporation (in addition to complying with the provisions contained in article 4 hereofJ, (a) adopt and take over all contracts, agreements, and arrangements m^de by the concessionnaire or his agents, and ratify and adopt all acts done by him or them in the exercise, or purported exercise, of the powers hereby granted, (b) indemnify the concessionnaire and his agents against all actions, proceedings, judgments, losses, claims, demands, and expenses whatsoever which he or they may at any time theretofore have suffered, sustained, or incurred, or may at any time thereafter suffer, sustain, or incur, in connection with the exercise, or pur ported exercise, by him or them of the rights, liberties, and authorities hereby granted, and generally with the carrying on of the navigation. And the concessionnaire shall thereupon account to the company for any profit which may have been earned by carrying on the said navigation as aforesaid. The guarantee above mentioned shall be that of a the London ba»k to he approved by 44is ■Brbanftie -Majesty’s bi-everanieut,- agency of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, and shall be for the amount and in the form of the draft guarantee, which, for the purpose of identification, has been initialled by his Excellency Hakki Pasha and the concessionnaire.

This suggestion was communicated to Sir G. Mackenzie, who objected to the introduction of [2985 7—1] B the history of the proposed Lynch-Hamidieh June 20, 1913 (29483/1913).) 1905, Sir N. O’Oonor, Telegraphic, March 27, 1907 (10003, File 1910/07). nople that the Anatolian Railway Company were in negotiation with the Turkish Civil List with a view to obtaining the latter’s monopoly of navi gation of the Tigris in return for a loan. Sir G. view2 Mr. D’Arcy, but proceeded to make overtures to Mr. Lynch, and furnished him with a file of the correspondence with Sir C. Hardinge and Mr. Vere. Mr. Lynch, however, asked Sir G. Mackenzie to leave the matter in his hands, as he was working to bring about a co-operation of the British and Turkish steamer services on the Tigris. His agent, Colonel Picot, called at the Foreign Office on the 13th May, 1907, v and Sir C. Hardinge pointed out to him the objections to the scheme being wrecked for the gratification of Mr. Lynch’s personal ambitions. At this inter view it was agreed that Colonel Picot should urge Mr. Lynch to send Mr. Ramsay to Constantinople to open negotiations; and Colonel Picot was warned that, if it were reported that Mr. Lynch had no chance of getting the concession, “ we should put forward the British India Company and support it for all it was worth.” It is to be noted that up to this point (May 1907) there had not been any direct communication between the Foreign Office and Mr. Lynch, and that Sir G. Mackenzie had for some years been engaged in negotiations to obtain control of the Hamidieh steamers before it was suggested that Mr. Lynch should co-operate with him. Here the first stage of the matter ended ; the second was not begun until September 1908, when Sir G. Mackenzie reported that the adminis tration of the Hamidieh Company was in a state of chaos. He offered through his agents at Constantinople to purchase their steamers or to undertake the management of the river service, on the understanding that the vessels should fly the Ottoman flag. In the course of subsequent negotiations (1908/09) he proposed the formation of a Turkish company with British capital and under British management to take over the navigation concession and river service. These negotiations were broken off by him in June 1909 on learning that steps were being taken to effect the Lynch-Hamidieh fusion arrangement. Negotiations for this proposed fusion arrange ment were entered into by Mr. Lynch without the knowledge of Sir G. Mackenzie or of the Foreign Office. The first information about it received at 0fficewas fur nished on the 5 th June, 1909, by Sir G. Mackenzie, who had been confi dentially informed by Colonel Picot earlier in the * * The interview was held either on May 11, i 2 , or 13, 1907.

Colonel Picot asserted that the transaction had the full approval of the Foreign Office, but his assertion was disposed of by Sir C. Hardinge, who wrote (in a minute) “ There can be no question of the transaction having the approval of the Foreign Office since we do not know what the transaction is . . . Sir G. Lowther, Sir G. Lowther, His Majesty’s Ambassador at 19°' 1908 (37118 ^ Constantinople, had reported in October 1908 File 2344/1908). that the Turkish Minister for Public Works was in favour of a scheme under which Messrs. Lynch’s Company would abandon their rights of naviga tion on the Tigris and Euphrates, and combine with the Hamidieh Steamship Company in the formation of an Ottoman company to be granted a concession for a monopoly of the navigation of those rivers, but the Foreign Office were not aware that Mr. Lynch was in negotiation with the Porte for the conclusion of an arrangement on those lines. On the 22nd June, 1909, Colonel Picot com municated to the Foreign Office a draft conven tion* drawn up for fusion of the rights and interests of the Lynch and Hamidieh Companies, 1909 ( 23153 ! Me and stated that Messrs. Lynch had received active 322/1909). support and assistance from Sir G. Lowther in the negotiation of the Convention. After Sir G.

Lynch’s negotiations were Mr. Marling, strongly supported by the Foreign Office and No. 975, Decern- ^ Embassy at Constantinople, and repeated (46723, FUe 9 assurances were given to His Majesty’s Govern- 322/1909). ment ^ tlie p orte ^at they would effect the fusion. . .

This deputy subsequent y organised opposition to the Lynch-Hamidieh fusion arrange ment in Parliament and press, and at Bagdad. + Sir G Mackenzie’s negotiations had been favourably regarded by the Foreign Office, and the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence indicated a preference for the British India Steam Navigation Company as the British firm which should be assisted to acquire the Ilamidieh steamers (10137/1909). [2985 i—l] L Colonel Picot, June 22, 1909 (23670, File 322/1909). Foreign Office4 and Ellerman lines had withdrawn opposition to the Lynch scheme at his instigation; an Messrs E. D. Sassoon and Mr. R. L. Harmsworth requested the support of His Majesty’s Govern ment in respect of offers made by them to the Turkish Government to purchase the Hamidieh steamers and concession. The latter two firms were informed that the Turkish Government had decided to grant the concession to Messrs. Lynch. Shortly before this correspondence with Messrs. Sassoon and Harmsworth, the Turkish Ambassador stated at an interview with Sir C. Hardinge that another British Company was in competition with Messrs. Lynch, and was informed that nothing was known at the Foreign Office of any rival company, and that His Majesty’s Government hoped the concession would be granted to Lynch’s firm. When communicating the substance of this interview to Sir G. Lowther, Sir E. Grey remarked that “ were an offer made by a respect able British firm, such as the British India Navigation Company, His Majesty’s Government could not object if the Turkish Government were to grant the concession to them.” It is not necessary for the purpose of this memorandum to trace in detail the progress of the Lynch-Hamidieh fusion negotiations. A campaign against the proposed arrangement was carried on in the Turkish press, and strong feeling was excited in the Turkish Parliament by the monopolistic character of the scheme, and the provision for compensation in the event of the Tigris and Euphrates becoming un- navigable as a result of irrigation work. At Basra and Bagdad considerable opposition to the fusion was manifested, and at the latter place merchants, including Oriental Christians and Jews, were at first inclined to join in the agitation. A protest on behalf of the British merchants at Bagdad against the fusion monopoly was made by Mr. J. L&gt;. Cree (Messrs. Blockley Cree and Co.), but on the other hand, Messrs. Gray, Hawes and Co. and nine other important fims addressed the Foreign Office in favour of the proposed arrangement.

He was also told that in future the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates would be thrown open to Ottoman subjects only. Subsequently he was given to understand that the Porte would not object to the fusion, but the new Company could not be granted a monopoly and would only receive simple permits of navigation similar to those issued to Turkish subjects. On the 12th July, 1910, a letter was addressed to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company stating that apprehension as to the effect of the monopolistic or exclusive features of the fusion scheme had been expressed to Sir E. Grey in quarters quite independent of it, and he therefore considered it impracticable to induce the Turkish Government to accept the scheme. Mr. Lynch called at the Foreign Office in reference to this letter, and asserted that he had started the scheme at the instiga tion of the Foreign Office. This statement was minuted by Sir C. Hardinge, “ This is cer tainly not true.” On the 22nd July, Mr. Lynch wrote to the Foreign Office and to Mr. Norman reiterating this assertion, and was informed, by direction of Sir E. Grey, that he was under a misapprehension on the point, and that the first information received by the Foreign Office came from an independent source and was to the effect that his firm had already begun negotiations with the Turkish Government with a view to effect the amalgamation. Mr. Lynch replied that he had made the statement with the knowledge of Colonel Picot, who had charge of the negotia tions from the first, and that he hoped soon to furnish the Foreign Office, if desired, with full documentary evidence as to its correctness. On the 13th October, 1910, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company addressed the Foreign Office on the subject in further detail. They wrote as follows :— “ q have received .communication of a lettei addiessed by you to Mr. H. F. B. Lynch on the 28th July, and of his reply of the 30th July, on the subject of the recent abortive negotiations for the fusion of the navigation ' interests on the rivers of Mesopotamia. We understand that the matter was discussed on the 20th ultimo with Lord Hardinge by Colonel Picot*and that it is not denied that pressure was brought to hear upon this company by the Foreign Office with a view to our obtaining control * There is no record of this interview in the official archives.6 tjver the Turkish service in order to stave off similar action on the part of the German interests. We were informed that if we held back others would receive the support of the Foreign Office in taking our place. It was in response to this pressure and at the express instance of the Foreign Office that negotiations were commenced for the acquisition of the Turkish line. It is quite true that the form of the acquisition did not emanate from the Foreign Office. It emanated from the Turkish Govern ment, who refused to give us control over their service unless we formed an Ottoman company into which the British and the Turkish services should be fused. Their proposal was carefully considered by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and was referred by Colonel Picot personally to Sir Charles Hardinge in the spring of 1909. It required consideration, as it involved the disappearance of the British flag. It was decided on behalf of His Majesty’s Government to support the proposal, provided that we obtain control of the combined companies. I am to add that the transference to the combined enterprise of the exclusive rights of the Turkish company has always formed an integral part of our scheme. Indeed, such transference was the only way in which we, or any other parties, could effect the object of the Foreign Office, namely, to prevent a disturbance of the status quo on the river by the advent of German interests. “My board consider it the more necessary to invite your attention to the origin of the negotiations, inasmuch as it serves to throw light upon the existing situation. If German interests acquire control of the Turkish Govern ment steamers the concern with its exclusive rights will pass to them, barring the way to an extension of our operations to meet the increased competition. If, on the other hand, we were to acquire control of the concern without the exclusive rights, German interests would certainly claim permission to form an Ottoman company on the rivers, and the object which the Foreign Office had in view would be defeated. It seems important that this should be clearly realised.” No reply was returned in regard to tire state ments thus made. In conclusion, it may be interesting to note that, in answer to a (question as to the opinion of His Majesty’s Government as regards British companies other than Mr. Lynch’s seeking to obtain rights of navigation on the rivers of Mesopotamia, Sir G. Lowther was informed on To Sir G. Lowther, the 6 th June, 1910, that “His Majesty’s Govern- ment are not pledged to support the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company alone ’ among British firms in applications to the Porte for rights of this nature.” EDWARD PARKES.

Slaughter and May, solicitors, representing Mr. Lynch, called to-day by appointment. I said that, as he was no doubt aware, his partner Mr. Slaughter had called last week with reference to Mr. Lynch’s interests in the Meso potamian Navigation concession, and to put before the Foreign Office certain aspects of the case, and I read to him the greater part of the record of that interview which he said corre sponded with what Mr. Slaughter himself had told him. I said that before the interview it had been intended to speak to Mr. Slaughter very pointedly with regard to certain language which Mr. Lynch was reported to have employed with regard to the river navigation and the general settlement with Turkey, but that, in view of the conciliatory attitude of Mr. Slaughter only a very general hint of the matter was given, as it was understood that Mr. Lynch was genuinely desirous of an amicable settlement. Mr. Mortimer said that Mr. Slaughter had understood from our remarks that Mr. Lynch had been speaking in a hostile sense, and that he had carefully impressed upon him that it was not correct for him to act in this manner while nego tiations were in progress with him. I replied that the advice given by Mr. Slaughter had unfortunately not been acted upon, and that we had independent proof from several sources that Mr. Lynch was carrying on an agitation, and that he was doing so not only here, but in Paris, in Germany, and in Turkish quarters ; that his action was not confined to British interests, but that he had called into play imaginary foreign interests in order to serve his own purposes. The proposals laid before Mr. Lynch by His Majesty’s Government were dictated by a desire to give due consideration to his claims , but these, in his own view, seemed to grow from day to day, for whereas he had first stated that he recognised that it was just that he should not be the concessionnaire for the new Company, he had now written and claimed to be recommended [918—8]'' - w “ &lt; I i immediately to !the Turkish Envoy as the concessionnaire. I was instructed to say that, in view of the information which had reached Sir E. Grey with regard to the language of Mr. Lynch, he had now seriously considered whether he should not with draw the offer made to him on the 19th May, and, consequence of his unpatriotic efforts to wreck the general settlement, withdraw all future diplo matic support from any company associated with Mr. Lynch in any foreign country. Sir E. Grey had decided that His Majesty’s Government could not now further a settlement on the lines of the 19th May memorandum, though they would take no steps to impede one if Mr. Lynch could come to terms with Lord Inchcape on that basis. If however Mr. Lynch continued to carry on an agitation in the manner complained of, and if it had any effect on the success of the general settlement or of the navi gation settlement, Sir E. Grey would make a full statement in Parliament, and bring out Mr. Lynch’s personal responsibility for the break down of negotiations which were being pursued in the general interests of British trade, and which had great political as well as commercial importance. Mr. Mortimer, who read to me a very sensible letter which Mr. Slaugther had written to Mr. Lynch after his last interview at the Foreign Office, said he would impress upon Mr. Lynch most emphatically what bad been said. I told him that we did not want to enter into an acri monious correspondence, and that was why we had sent for him and not communicated with Mr. Lynch direct. A. P.

Hakki Pasha aoreed © to the two groups of the Board voting by units if the Chairman so desires, and this would effectively secure control by the British Chairman. The concession, with the modifications shown in italics, is being re-printed. Hakki Pasha told us that Mr. Lynch, when in Paris, had visited Djavid Bey, to whom he had stated that it only required a hint from Hakki Pasha for the Foreign Office to designate Mr. Lynch as the concessionnaire for the new Company. Hakki Pasha had explained the posi tion to Djavid Bey. He remarked that the last letter from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, of which he had sent a copy to Sir L. Mallet, contained a threat against him, and he had not replied to it, and did not intend to do so. After the meeting was over I asked Hakki Pasha if he had heard anvthing about the oil question, and he replied that he had not. I said that the British and German Governments were discussing the question in order to see if the groups concerned could not be brought to terms, and it was obviously very important that the Ottoman Government should not further commit itself in the meantime. Hakki Pasha said he realised this, but there was a question of a small advance, say £ T. 500,000 by the National Bank to Turkey, and Turkey was badly in need of funds, and if the National Bank made any con dition about the oil concession the Ottoman Government would be much embarrassed, for they had seldom had such urgent need of money. He further said, as I already knew, that Sir H. Babington-Smith was in Paris this week. I feel a little anxious about this, and it is matter for consideration whether the Anglo- Persian Company should not now make some advance to Turkey, in order to confirm their position, or at all events to get an assurance that their interests would not be left out of account. [918—7]2 Haiti Pasha asked me if we had news about the Turco-Persian frontier, as he had hear t the Ottoman Government had practically ac- cepted the Anglo-Eossian proposals, and he said that this attitude of conciliation was solely due to a strong desire to please the British Govern ment. I said that our news corresponded with his own, and that we certainly attached very great importance to a final settlement, whic seemed at last to be in sight. A. P.

Slaughter and May, Solicitors, Austin Friars, called on the 11th July on behalf of Mr. Lynch and with reference to the Tigris navigation concession. Sir L. Mallet, Mr. Stanley, Mr. Hurst and I were present. Mr. Slaughter, w T ho was courteous and con ciliatory throughout the interview, explained that it had seemed to him that Mr. Lynch’s claims were not meeting with adequate recognition; his name was associated almost historically with the navigation of the Tigris; he had for some years carried on negotiations with Turkey, at the instance of His Majesty’s Government, for a similar concession to that now under considera tion, and his concession had been approved by the Turkish Parliament by a large majority; it was true that the concession referred to had in volved the disappearance of the British flag, but on this point Mr. Lynch was willing to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government, as he would agree to the retention of his ships side by side with the proposed new company ; what he did ask was that he should be the concessionnaire, but he was walling, within reason, to meet His Majesty’s Government by the admission to the board of such persons as they might desire if he held the control. What he did feel unjust was that he should have to go to a stranger to the navigation—a newcomer—and ask, hat in hand, for admission to a minor share in the new company. We explained to Mr. Slaughter that His Majesty’s Government had never admitted Mr. Lynch’s con tention that the negotiations of some years ago had been undertaken by him with the Turkish Government “ at the instance of His Majesty’s Government ” ; we were well awrare that Mr. Lynch had continued to make the assertion during and immediately after the negotiations in question; that the Foreign Office had declined to adhere to such a statement, but had not continued to con tradict Mr. Lynch after the breakdown of the [918—5]2 % negotiations at Constantinople, as to do so would ! serve no useful purpose ; that more than half a dozen minutes existed, by Sir C. Hardinge and others, to the effect that Mr. Lynch’s assertion that he had negotiated “ at the instance of His Majesty’s Government,” and other assertions in a similar sense, were “not true”; that the late Sir G. Mackenzie, of the British India Steam Navigation Company, had carried on negotiations with reference to the Tigris navigation since 1900, and that the Foreign Office (and indeed the Committee of Imperial Defence) had never considered Mr. Lynch the most desirable concessionnaire, and would always have preferred someone else, as was evident from the minutes of the last ten years ; that it was misleading to describe Lord Inchcape, of the British India Company, as a “newcomer,” since his firm had been seeking to participate in the river navigation for years ; that the Turkish Government had consistently maintained for sixty years that Mr. Lynch’s right to run two steamers was subject to termination at the con venience of the Turkish Government, and that although His Majesty’s Government had contested this point of view .fckai they had never, until the present time,,, had any prospect of obtaining recognition of Mr. Lynch’s rights as permanent; that the right to run a third steamer was expressly conceded as a temporary measure to meet congestion of traffic ; and that, such being the existing attitude of the Turkish Go vernment, it was a substantial benefit to Mr. Lynch if the Turkish Government were to be induced to recognise as permanent Mr. Lynch’s right to run three steamers, and to hold a fourth in reserve; that Mr. Lynch was in addition offered a fair working arrangement with the new Company, and a substantial participation in it, with a seat on the Board y that there was no desire to treat him unfairly; but that the memorandum handed to him on the 19th May, 1913, indicated the utmost limit to which His Majesty’s Govern ment were prepared to support him ; that he had at first stated that he thought it reasonable that His Majesty’s Government in their desire to broaden the basis of the monopoly should not have chosen him as the concessionnaire ; but that recently, in his correspondence with the Board of Trade, his letters had shown crescendo aversion from what he at first admitted to be reasonable, until finally in his letter of the 7th July he had claimed thatlie should be given &lt;£ forthwith authority to negotiate himself, as the concessionnaire, with the Turkish envoy. We further pointed out that although Mr. Lynch and his ancestors had been associated with ^navigation on the Tigris for sixty years or so, British ships had navigated the river for centuries before the Lynch connection had taken an interest in it, and British vessels had assisted the Pashas of Bagdad in the main tenance of order. Mr. Slaughter said that he had now had placed before him a very different aspect of affairs to what Mr. Lynch had represented to him ; that he had been particularly impressed by our assurance that Mr. Lynch did not negotiate “ at the instance of His Majesty’s Government” in previous years; and that he would discuss the matter with him in all its bearings. Mr. Lynch had not consulted him before writing his mere recent letters to the Board of Trade. He then asked a direct question, “Why were not His Majesty’s Government prepared to select Mr. Lynch as the concessionnaire,” to which the direct reply was given, “ Because they do not consider him a proper person to be the con cessionnaire.” Some discussion then took place with regard to the terms of the memorandum of the 19th May, 1913, and as to what was ’meant by “ a substantial share of the British capital of the • company ” : we agreed that probably a third would not be an improbable or excessive proportion. Mr. Slaughter then asked if he might see the draft concession; but we demurred to this, explaining firstly that we had had very definite indications that Mr. Lynch’s attitude might be hostile, and that he had indeed already spoken in hostile terms about the concession in Turkish quarters, and secondly that it was not necessary at this stage that Mr. Lynch should see the concession, as he would be quite able to hammer out the proposed working arrangement without it. Mr. Slaughter rather doubted if this was the case ; but we maintained that the moment at any rate had not yet arrived for communicating the draft to Mr. Lynch. Mr. Slaughter begged us to be assured that he would not have asked us to show the concession to him if he had been aware that Mr. Lynch had been in hostile communication on the subject with the Turks.4 1 It had been intended 1 to make a very stiff com munication to Mr. Slaughter in consequence ol Mr. Lynch’s remarks to Hakki Pasha (see memo randum of the 8 th July), to the effect that Sir E. Grey was at first, on learning of this language, inclined to withdraw all future diplomatic support from any Company asso ciated with Mr. Lynch, as he regarded his language as an attempt to blackmail Hakki Pasha, and through him His Majesty’s Government, and to frustrate the whole settlement with Turkey; but that on consideration he was prepared to allow the offer of the 19th May to stand, provided Mr. Lynch carried on no further agitation against the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, and provided he accepted the memorandum without undue delay as a basis for agreement: but, in consequence of the conciliatory attitude of Mr. Slaughter, it was merely intimated that Mr. Lynch had been actively and objectionably engaged in opposing the settle ment in view. It was pointed out to Mr. Slaughter that Mr. Lynch did not appear to have examined the proposals contained in the memorandum of the 19th May on their merits ; that there was no- wish to drive him off the river ; and that he was given adequate protection and a fair measure of partici pation if he wished for it; but that, in view of the great importance of the river to British interests in general, he could not be given a monopoly for the future. Mr. Slaughter thanked Sir L Mallet for seeing * him, and requested that no answer should be sent to Mr. Lynch’s letter of the 20th June to us and of the / th July to the Board of Trade until we heard further.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 12 of the 25th February last respecting arrangements at Basra for forwarding the material for the construction of the Bagdad Railway, I have the honour to report that, in reply to my enquiries yesterday, I was informed that, of the live steam-tugs to be provided by the Societe de Transports fluviaux en Orient under their agreement with the Bagdad Railway Company, the “ Shirin ” is now running, the “ Sheytan ” is launched from Lynch’s dock and ready to run, but awaits orders from London, the “ Shihab ” is completed and is ready to be launched from Lynch’s dock, the “ Shnhrur ” has just been laid down on the stocks, and is therefore under construction at Lynch’s dock, and the “ Sumana ” is on the steamship “ Adalia,” due here at the end of May. Of the eighteen barges promised, ten have been built in Lynch’s dock and are now ready, and eight more remain to has not yet begun to run, owing to the delay in providing the necessary means of transport, and that the present arrangements are outside the contract. A hitch appears to have occurred in providing the material, which for the past few months has been arriving in very small quantities, but 4,000 tons are expected in a month’s time from now T . The material, under these temporary arrangements, is being forwarded in barges towed by the “Shirin,” belonging to the Societe, the “Tekrit,” “Samarra,” and “Pioneer,” belonging to Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. or the Bagdad Railway Company, it is not clear which, and Lynch’s own steamers. The Idare Nahrieh steamers and those of the Arab Steamship Company (Aga Jafer) are, I am informed, now assisting in the operations. I am given to understand that, when the necessary means of transport are provided by the Societe de Transports fluviaux en Orient, the above vessels, with the exception of the “Shirin,” will cease to co-operate, and the contract with the Bagdad Railway Company will begin to run. I.also learn that the Bagdad Railway depot near Maghil is now completed, and that the engineer in charge, Herr Baacke, will shortly transfer his place of residence to the house of Messrs.

Xame and Date. Subject. for. FaAdFi. F s /0i : % JULISi ; COPY TO INDIA r 121■ CONFIDENTIAL. Memorandum. I WENT to Lord Inehcape’s house this morning to meet Hakhi Pasha and to go through the draft concession for the Tigris navigation with him and Lord Inchcape. The concession consists of 32 articles, and it was nearly six before we had gone through the whole. Hakki Pasha began by saying that he had had a visit from Mr. Lynch, who had spoken in the strongest terms of the evil consequences which the Ottoman Government would incur from granting the concession to anyone but himself ; Mr. Lynch was determined to do his utmost to protect his own interests ; he would take legal action against the Ottoman Government; he would carry on a political agitation against it in Constantinople and Mesopotamia; he would expose the action of Hakki Pasha in favouring the concession, and indeed his whole mission to England, to the most damaging criticism through his friends in Turkey; he had already engaged the services of a Turkish lawyer; he had also consulted Sir T. Barclay, a man of great legal experience; and he would carry on a press and political propaganda in England. We asked Hakki Pasha if any action against the Turkish Government would lie, and he said in his opinion (which is that of a lawyer) it would not, but that it would be very desirable to prevent the agitation from assuming large dimensions, and he said he would ask His Majesty’s Government to give him some official document saying that they wished Lord Inchcape to be the concessionnaire and objected to Mr. Lynch being in that capacity. I said that I thought there would be no difficulty in meeting his wishes, and we agreed that the form of the document and its terms should be discussed later. Hakki Pasha agreed that Mr. Lynch’s attitude was largely “ bluff.” It is, however, matter for consideration whether the Foreign Office should [918—1] *2 not now reply to Mr. Lynch s last letter (which he asked in a private letter should not be replied to until he had submitted alternative proposals, which he promised to do a week ago) pointing out that His Majesty's Government must with draw the offer made to him to participate in the new concession, unless he intimates his 'uiHing ness to consider the offer made to him within a reasonable time, and that if any agitation takes place in Turkey through his agenc} against the arrangements under negotiation with His Majesty’s Government, the latter will likewise feel compelled to withdraw the offer made to him. Perhaps it would be better to wait a week first in order to see if Mr. Lynch communicates further with us. Before entering on the discussion of the draft concession Hakki Pasha told me that the Turkish Government was tl much annoyed ” by our unwillingness to lend officers for Armenia; it was deplorable that we had yielded to Russia, as if she placed her own officers in Armenia it was merely a first step towards annexation. I said I was not familiar with the latest correspon dence on this subject, but he asked me to mention that he had thus referred to the question, and I noticed that the matter had upset him and that lie was far more difficult to negotiate with to-dav than ever before. ' Most of the changes he desired in the draft concession were in the direction of leaving out all reference to “ His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment,” as he said that it would be without pre cedent for the Ottoman Government to admit, in regard to a lurkish concession, the intervention of a foreign Government. Lord Inchcape and I agreed that in most cases the difficulty could be overcome (a) by substituting “ the Chairman of the Board ” for “ His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment where it occurred, and ( 6 ) by the Chair man entering into obligations with His Majesty’s Government in regard to the points in question. The several points will have to be considered with the text of the concession, as amended, and it was suggested that this should be done by Loid Inchcape s solicitors in consultation with the Boaid of Tiade. I am having the concession reprinted with the amendments shown. A further meeting with Hakki Pasha is arranged for Thursday, the 17th July, at 3 o’clock,jind in the meantime the concession is to he translated, as amended, into French, as Hakki Pasha says he cannot finally judge what amend ments are necessary until he can see the French ' wording. A. V. July 8 , 1913.^ [Tins Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.! &lt; [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. ^ — — CONFIDENTIAL. [June 21.] Section 1. [Amended Copy.] [28421] No. 1. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to Foreign Office.—(Received June 21.) 3, Salters' Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, Sir, June 20, 1913. I HAVE the honour to enclose a copy of our letter of to-day’s date addressed to the Board of Trade. My board has been animated by a sincere desire to meet the views of the Secretary of State, as expressed in the memorandum of the 19th May, and to find some way of safeguarding the vital interests of this company, while not running counter to the realisation of those views. But the communication of the negotiations to the prospective concessionnaire has seriously compromised the situation, and it would appear that we are unlikely to receive satisfaction on the lines that have been laid down. Under these circumstances my board trusts that you may be willing to discuss the matter further with us. At the same time, I am to state that the impression which we have received is that the appointment of someone from outside to be the concessionnaire of the new company will be likely to produce an effect upon public opinion the reverse of that which you have informed us is the object of this appointment. If that be the case we are quite at a loss to know for w 1 : at reason this third party is being substituted for ourselves in the formation of the new Ottoman company. For years past we have been negotiating with the Turkish Government, at your instance, for the creation of such a company under our control. V et, when the moment becomes favourable for getting the company formed, we are thrust upon one side in favour of a third party. It cannot surely be said that we have been instrumental in introducing German interests to the navigation of these rivers. Germany possessed powers under the Bagdad Railway Convention of placing steamers on the Euphrates and Tigris for the transport of railway material. Had we not stepped in, such German-owned vessels would now be plying on these waters. We succeeded in obtaining half this interest for Great Britain, and all the steamers ordered and now plying for this special purpose have been constructed in British yards under our supervision. We kept His Majesty’s Government fully informed of this transaction. We have submitted everything that has come from the German side to His Majesty’s Government, being most careful not to commit ourselves in any way without the express sanction of our own Foreign Office. And we have always contended for the maintenance upon these waters of the British flag and of the British company as part of any completely satisfactory solution. ill On the other hand, we have no desire to conceal our regret, based upon a long experience of the exigencies of the situation as a whole, that a solution cannot be found under which British and German interests in Mesopotamia may be combined in common enterprises rather than separated in distinct undertakings. The railway from the Mediterranean to Bagdad is probably now destined to remain German; but British participation in any line that may be built south of Bagdad, and in the branch lines centring in Bagdad, and German participation in the navigation of the great water ways might, we still venture to believe, be taken as the basis of a general settlement. If not we greatly fear that German and British interests, divided into watertight compartments, will not only seek to prejudice one another, but will operate to the prejudice of the economic interests of Turkey. The German railway interest will work against the British navigation interest. When proposals for irrigation come up for serious discussion, German interests will range themselves on the side of cheap schemes, resulting in the destruction of the navigation and m the building of a fresh crop of a railways. This would be obviated if the maintenance of the navigation were made a joint British and German interest. Rivalry between these interests might suit the diplomacy of certain other Powers ; but it would scarcely seem m consonance [2950 x—1] jUt 1 SI 32 with the aims of British diplomacy or likely to subserve the best interests of Turkey, which would far rather be promoted by a close and harmonious union of the two greatest commercial forces in these provinces^Jihe Ottoman Empire. i TTRFT) W PARRY Kpy'rvtnm Enclosure in No. 1. Euphrates and Tigris Steam avigtion Company to Eoai d of Trade. 3, Salters Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, Sir&gt; June 20, 1913. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with respect to the arrangements under contemplation for the future of the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris. - yjj 1 . In reply I am to state that, when the memorandum of the Secretary of State was handed to our chairman on the 19th May during the course of an interview accorded to him and myself at the Foreign Office, it was verbally explained to us that, subject to the control of the new Ottoman company being vested in an outside concessionnaire, there was the strongest disposition on the part of our Foreign Office to meet our own requirements in the constitution of the new company. But, it was added, the Foreign Office did not feel itself competent to discuss the business side of the question with us. It had therefore placed that side in the hands of the Board of Trade, which in its turn could be assisted by the best expert advice from outside. At this and at a subsequent interview accorded to our chairman at the Foreign Office on the 21st May, we were informed that the question of who the con cessionnaire shall be was under consideration ; that certain names had been placed before the Secretary of State by the Board of Trade. We were urged to accept the memorandum of the Secretary of State as a basis for negotiation, and to lose no time in the endeavour to make it amenable to our interests by “ hammering out a reasonable agreement with the Board of Trade, which was fully competent to deal with the question. It was under these circumstances that our chairman sent to Mr. Barker at the Foreign Office his confidential memorandum of the 21st May, under cover of a letter requesting that nothing should be said to a prospective concessionnaire until we had ascertained whether it would be possible to “ hammer out ” an arrange ment, on the basis of the Secretary of State’s proposals, which would effectually safe guard the interests of this company. Our chairman gave strong verbal expression to his personal doubts as to the feasibility of such an arrangement on that basis. The proposal was that this company should be restricted in the future to the use of three steamers only and a reserve steamer, while arrangements were to be “ hammered out ” under which, for a period of sixty years, it was to be enabled to live and prosper along side of a new Ottoman Company under British control which, subject to our three ^teamei^ was to be invested with exclusive rights of navigation and with the fullest powei^o expansion. It was therefore agreed that our chairman’s memorandum of the , . s ' a - v b 0 . T1 v 3e 1 re ? ar '‘ e d as quite non-committal and tentative. In pursuance of this course of procedure, I myself called at the Board of Trade and put forward certain suggestions which might form a basis for subsequent discussions, to be held upon the return of ^ir Hubert Llewellyn Smith. I had no idea that these suggestions would be communicated to a concessiomiaire, or, indeed, that any of the detailed information for asked ^s and on previous occasions would go beyond ourselves. I W £ th f at /fully justified in this attitude in view of the * Ai myeatei m t e eleventh paragraph of our chairman’s memorandum of the (.th May, which, I understand, was submitted to you and accepted as correct, ° f th6 pUrelj tentatlve liatu re of the discussions winch I had been instructea to commence. ckiJ; I ( earnt subsequently that tie concessiomiaire had alreadv been ■indBiiMfe T ° f S t 1 S memo r and,lm of tie 19th Mav was handed to us, interview which f A .f A 86 4° Uch with negotiations. And since the informed Wst nT ? n 'll 3t ^® 0 ? rd of Trade 26th Mar we hare been ie Brt L,f n t c±? Ue L e lyU Sn ; lth that Ae Board proposes to cinfine itself to tne part of an intermediary between the concessionnaire and ourselves. the faeMhi; voBniirBi 31 . cre f tes for us a “ew situation, especially in view of • u cer,am of our proposals on the ground that “ thev havealready been rejected by the concessionnaire.” It appears to ns that the concessionnaire has been placed in a position to dictate his own terms, and we cannot therefore see that any useful purpose would be served by a meeting with him as matters now stand, i ou inform us further that our proposals as regards representation on the board of the new company and participation in the local management go beyond the scope of the Secretary of State s memorandum of the 19th May. With great respect we cannot see how tney do. The casting vote, and therefore the control, would remain in the hands of the concessionnaire, and there is nothing in the Secretary of State’s memorandum to exclude us from participation in the local management. The concessionnaire would of course prefer that his own firm should be enabled to extend itself from the seaboard to the interior, supported by the emoluments of the local management. It would mean to his firm a very large increase in the windfall which has come their way. We can fully understand his rejecting our proposals under this head. But for us participation in the local management and strong representation on the board are not merely material aims ; they are essential safeguards. Unless we can be given a strong voice in the direction and management of the new company we are better out of it altogether. 3. Failing an arrangement on these lines, we would beg to refer to the request contained in the concluding paragraph of our despatch of the 9th instant. We are not afraid of competition, but we claim to be placed in a position to meet it on equal terms. This company was originally formed to navigate the Euphrates and Tigris on lines indicated in a despatch from the Foreign Office, wherein no mention was made of restrictions on the number of the steamers it might see fit to employ. The Turkish steamers, which it is now proposed to transfer to a new Ottoman company under British control and management, wdth exclusive rights of navigation for a period of sixty years, were not at that time in existence. If, for political reasons, His Majesty’s Government now prefer to abandon the amalgamation scheme which, at the instance of our Govern ment, w r e worked so hard to secure a year or two ago, and to keep this company in being, this company should either be placed in a position to deal in the future in its own vessels with its present proportion of the traffic, under a working arrangement with the concessionnaire of the new company, or, failing such an arrangement, no limit whatever should be placed on the number of steamers it may employ. We respectfully submit that this is a strictly reasonable request, though it may fall short of that share in the navigation of these waters vdiich our past efforts may have entitled us to expect would be allotted to us on the present occasion. I am, &amp;c. FRED. W. PARRY, Secretary. Minute by Mr. Malkin. I do not think that any legal points arise on this letter, but as I have been asked for my views as to Lynch’s position I will give them. So far as I am aware, there are no contractual or other legal relations between Lynch and His Majesty s Government which give him any claim upon them, in the sense of a right wLich could be enforced in court. Nor do I see that he has any moral claim. I should say, however, that 1 do not know anything of the matters referred to in the fourth paragraph of this letter. Whether these facts are accurately stated, and whether, if so, they give Lynch any right to more than the maintenance of his existing concession, can only be decided by persons more familiar with them than myself. . . ,, Apart from this, the position appears to me to be as follows Lyncn noicls a strictly limited concession for navigation. The question whether, when the company was formed, it was considered that it was so limited, is really now academic; the limitations have in practice been admitted for fifty years, and the Porte has shown more disposition to restrict than to extend them. _ Of late years Lynch has had to face the competition of an Ottoman company, unlimited as to its rights, and backed, I believe, to some extent by the Porte. His Majesty’s Government now offer to Lynch : (a.) The confirmation and a slight extension of his existing rights, so that they cannot in future be questioned by the Porte. f T (b.) A considerable participation in, and a share m the direction of, a new company to be formed under British control to supersede the existing Ottoman company. I he effect should be that there will be no cut-throat competition between the two companies, and the new company will not be able to squeeze Lync ou .4 It seems to me obvious that the effect of this arrangement, if His Majesty Government can secure its adoption, will ^ greatly |o improve Lynch s ^ will not only have his existing rights secured, but will be in a much hetler position in regari to h^ competitor^rs tQ bg ^ ^ company wi u n ot get more than a certain amount of the expansion of trade. This is probably true but he is no worse off than h™ as before. He was tied down to his limited number of steamers, and all the trade that he could not carry must be carried by the Ottoman company. Under the proposed arrangement he will have a friendly neighbour instead of a hostile one, and will get his share of its profits, besides the chance of more economical w orkmg resn ting from oo-operatiom i g ^ ^ ^ of Lynch - B letter to the Board of Trade could, so far as I can see, only be carried out either by (a) limiting the traffic, (b) an arrangement bv which half the traffic should always be carried m Lynch s boats, and (c) increasing indefinitely the number of the boats which he is entitled to run. (a) is out of the question; ( 6 ) seems admirably calculated to cause congestion and prevent expansion of traffic ; (c) would not be consented to by the Porte. ? *lf Lynch remains obdurate, I do not see why His Majesty s Government would not he entitled to get the new company started, under their benevolent auspices, and leave Lynch to get along as best he can with his old concession, in which case he could hardly expect as much support from the Foreign Office as in the past. Possibly a hint of this might bring him to reason. The above views are of course those of a mere layman in the matter, which seems to he one of business. H. W. M.

Yours, &amp;c. PERCY ASHLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Draft of Despatch from Board of Trade to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited.) Sir, t T ? E Board of Trade have given careful consideration to your letter of the 20th June, but the result does not modify the views of this Department as stated in their letter of the 14th instant. With regard to the earlier portion of your letter, the Board do not desire to add to what was said m their previous letter beyond observing that any misconception on your part as to the pxtent to which the Board intended, at any particular stage, to acquaint the concessionnaire nominated by His Majesty’s Government with the views of the various parties interested could not, in the Board’s judgment, affect the present situation in any material respect. In the recent negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Imperial Ottoman Government, which form the foundation of the proposed new concession, provisions were included fully reserving to your company all the rights and privileges of navigation which, so far as the Board understand, they have hitherto enjoyed or have had any reasonable expectation of enjoying. In these circumstances, the Board are of opinion that it is misleading to suggest, as your letter appears to do, that these provisions entail any fresh restriction upon your company with regard to the number of steamers to be employed. On the contrary, in the opinion of the Board no inconsiderable benefit is conferred upon your company by the enumeration and confirmation of its existing privileges in a new diplomatic instrument, in view of the fact, of which you are doubtless aware, that there has hitherto been a divergence of view between the two Governments as to the tenure of these privileges. In addition to the above provisions in the declaration, His Majesty’s Government have undertaken to use their good offices to secure the conclusion of arrangements between your company and the proposed new company, including, inter alia, a working agreement to protect your company from unfair competition, besides provision for representation on the directorate, and for participation on favourable terms in the capital of the new concern. It has already been intimated to you that, in the Board’s opinion, the details of the working agreement and other matters to be arranged can only be properly settled after mutual discussion between your representatives and the concessionnaire.

Arguing on the analogy of the importance of the Samasta Kurrachee line to the gram-growing districts of the Punjaub, he suggests that the gram grown in Mesopotamia, when once the irrigation works are completed should form a large and profitable export trade from Basra, since, although the sea journey from Basra is longer than that of Kurrachee, the actual distance which the gram has to coyer to reach Basra from Mesopotamia is half or a third of that at present entailed m the journey from the Punjaub to Kurrachee. Mr. Lorimer is aware, of course of the possibility of the Mesopotamian grain being sent to Europe as cheaply via Alexandretta as vi&amp; Basra, but does not think this a veiy probable eventuality, especially if the Suez Canal dues are to be abated. Be is convinced that the river service will not survive the opening of the railwav and concludes therefore by urging the importance of His Majesty’s Government securing adequate influence over this Bagdad-Basra section, adding that it is imperative that this section of the work should be pushed on quickly so as to place the Persian Gu]f on a footing not inferior to the Mediterranean. With regard to my despatch No. 379 of the 3rd ultimo (printed in [209771) Mr. Lorimer states that the Eastern Bank is indirectly connected with the National Bank of Turkey, and that the largest shareholders are the Sassoon connection and financiers in Brussels and Paris. He further suggests that in any arrangement which may be come to regarding river navigation, the carriage of British mails to Bagdad should be secured. He had also heard confidentially that Mr. Lynch was manifesting some anxiety regarding the appearance of some rival in the fusion and monopoly schemes. Mr. Lorimer’s informant was not, however, very definite with regard to the identity of this person. A mutilated telegram in code from Mr. Lynch reached the representative last week enjoining him not to associate himself with any agitation in Bagdad, but mentioning some protest that was apparently to be made. Mr. Lorimer reports that no such agitation exists there at present, and did not feel in a position to question the representative on the subject. I have, &amp;c.

(Confidential.) THE substance of the suggestions put forward by Mr. Parry on behalf of Messrs. Lynch and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, at his interview at the Board of 'trade on Monday, the 26th May, have been communicated to the proposed concessionnaire (Lord Inchcape) and discussed with him. In reply, Lord Inchcape expresses his willingness, on behalf of the new company if formed, to conclude a working agreement with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company as to fares, rates, and the equitable apportionment of traffic between the two undertakings by means of a pool including a carrying rate. He suggests that the points in the pool should at the outset be on the basis of the estimated proportion of the river traffic at present carried by the fleets of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and of the Nahrieh Company respectively, and that any increase of traffic should be apportioned on the basis of the carrying capacity of the two fleets. Lord Inchcape further states that the statutes of the new company will provide effective means of securing that the British shares shall not pass into the hands of aliens. It is understood that similar arrangements will be made by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. [2950 ee—A] B i a i I 10 o fW lb* 1 mi SEC2 Lord Inchcape declares that there is not the least intention that the new Company shall at tern pt to acquire a predominant interest in the Euphrates and Tigris Steam ^ ^ aV i£ord'inchcape 1 ^considers it absolutely essential that the new company (hke the* Nahrieh Company up to the present time) shall appoint its own local agents distinct from those of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company Lord Inchcape is willing that one-third of the British share of the capital of the new company (say, 25,0001) should be offered for subscription by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and Messrs. Lynch together. ° Lord Inchcape does not propose to accept for himself any discount on the shares taken up by him as concessionnaire. This being so, he wouM much prefer that the company should not be loaded with any unproductive capital, but he is prepared to discuss with Mr. Lynch the question of the form and amount of any payment to be made to Messrs. Lynch or the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company m accordance with paragraph (4) of the note handed to Mr. Lynch at the Foreign Office on the 19th May. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to Board of Trade. 3, Salter's Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, gi r) June 9, 1913. THE character and present state of the negotiations which have been conducted on behalf of this company with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade in connection with the conditions which are in future to regulate the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris were explained to my Board to-day at a full meeting. After careful consideration I have been instructed to convey to you the following reply to your letter of the 2 nd instant, covering an aide-memoire embodying the views of Lord Inchcape :— The intimation contained in your letter under acknowledgment, to the effect that the suggestions submitted in the very tentative conversation between myself and Messrs. Stanley and Ashley at the Board of Trade have been placed before Lord Inchcape, has painfully surprised us. We were given to understand at the Foreign Office that the Board of Trade, assisted possibly by expert advice from outside, would he in a position to “ hammer out ” with us the heads of a working agreement to be concluded between the proposed new Ottoman company and this company. The procedure indicated was that this agreement would then be submitted to my Board and to our legal advisers. We were particularly requested to say nothing to Lord Inchcape at this stage ; and we, for our part, requested (see our chairman’s letters of the 21 st and 27th ultimo) that before the agreement had been “hammered out” nothing should be said to a prospective concessionnaire. The reasons for this will he obvious after a perusal of our chairman’s memorandum of the 21st ultimo communicated to the Foreign Office^ It was clearly understood that this memorandum was tentative and non committal. The Board of this company has only now been invited to consider the subject. The true nature of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government has still been unexplored^ Is it, for instance, proposed to set up two separate and expensive European administrations at the various internal ports to manage the pooled steamers? Would not this greatly hamper competition with a railway? To discuss such questions at this stage with a prospective concessionnaire, naturally anxious to push his own firm into the interior from the seaboard, would scarcely seem to be a profitable course. We also felt that, if \ve entered at such an early stage upon conversations with a prospective concessionnaire, we should be brought into relations of antagonism and conflict with him which it was highly desirable to avoid. My Board note that the proposals placed before us by the Secretary of State, as interpreted by Lord Inchcape, amount to the offer of one-third of the foreign share capital to he subscribed for by this company, the two companies to be worked on a poo mg airangement. Lord Inchcape proposes further that a payment shall be made to this company, m some other form than that of fully paid up shares, in consideration of t leu position as pioneers of the navigation.” In return for these ambiguous advantages and safeguards my board are asked to enter into certain guarantees and to forego ceitam claims. On the other hand, by the provisions of a diplomatic convention the concessionnaire would inherit the results of our lengthy negotiations with the Turkish Government at the instance of His Majesty’s Government; and the interestswhich he represents would not only be extended from the seaboard to the interior, but would be placed in a position of primacy in relation to the navigation of the internal -waters. With great respect my Board is unable to regard these proposals so interpreted as serious business propositions. r • with His Majesty s Government that for political reasons it might be best to forego the present favourable opportunity for reviving and carrying the amalgamation scheme and to keep this company in being. We did not. however, anticipate that we should be invited to take a merely subordinate part in the revival by British capital of the Ottoman company. We are the only parties who have established a claim to bring about this revival. Moreover, should we not be given a veiy effective say m the control and management of the new concern, to be endowed with unlimited powers of expansion, any safeguards in the shape of freight and pooling airangements would be wholly inadequate to withstand the changing circum stances of a^ long period of time. If the actual control is to be vested in other hands we submit that it is only just that we shall he offered the largest possible share in the new concern compatible with the holding and keeping by the concessionnaire of such actual control. Wb submit further that only in this way would there be any prospect for the survival and continued prosperity of the British company. I have the honour to enclose a memorandum containing the outlines of such an arrangement, framed in such a way as not to run counter to the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, while at the same time protecting, as we hope would be the case, the interests of our own company. The task has been a difficult one, and we do not see our way to whittling down any further the requirements contained therein, which, we submit, are strictly reasonable. Alternatively we would respectfully request His Majesty’s Government either to revive the amalgamation scheme or to arrange in the convention under negotiation with Turkey that the British company shall be endowed with powers of expansion at least sufficient to enable it to deal in the future with its present proportion of the traffic. I have, &amp;c. FRED. W. PARRY. Enclosure 4 in No. 1.

The statistics for the last five years, 1908-12 inclusive, establish the average quantity of the traffic carried by each company as follows : Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, 52 per cent, (thirteen twenty- fifths of the whole). Nahrieh Company, 4 8 per cent, (twelve twenty-fifths of the wdiole). If we confine ourselves to the last two years, 1911-12, the proportions work out as follows : — Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, 56 per cent, (fourteen twenty- fifths of the whole). Nahrieh Company, 44 per cent, (eleven twenty-fifths of the whole). It would only be fair to apportion the traffic on the actual conditions of fourteen twenty-fifths to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited) and eleven twenty-fifths to the Nahrieh Company. But 'as the fleet of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company is restricted, the extent to which this company could avail themselves of the benefit of this proportion w r ould, of course, be governed by the carrying capacity of this restricted fleet. The new Ottoman company would derive the benefit of any further increase in trade. The machinery to carry out this arrangement would be the following:— Each company would deal with its owm shippers independently. But a clearing house \\ quid be established at Bagdad, to be administered by a board of two controllers, one appointed to each company. The duties of the Board would consist of apportioning and adjusting the quantity of cargo and passengers between the two lines of steamers. Copies of the steamers freight manifests and passengers lists, showing total quantity of cargo and passengers can led and freight and passage money received, would be handed into the clearing house at the termination oi each voyage of each steamer belonging to each company. t the end of each month, or at any other convenient period, the total quantity of the traffic would be computed and the amount carried by each line of steamers ascertained. If one company should have carried more or less than its proper proportion, an adjustment would be made either by arranging for an increase or for a reduction in the quantity to he carried in the period or periods next following or by a freight credit. The two companies would fix the rate of freights and passenger fares to bemutfafcon^n^^^rl 16 and t0 make n ° chan ° e in the fixed rates e ^cept by be permitted ' N ^ COmmiSS10ns other fchan th °se mutually agreed would , Th f ak ° Ve arran gement would provide for the carriage of any quantity of cargo the trade demanded, as the Ottoman Company would be able to expand its freightage capacity by increasing its fleet, while the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited) would be secured m obtaining its proportion of the trade, as limited by the capacity of its steamers. Moreover, it would have the effect of preventing the Ottoman Company from putting on steamers not required by the trade. A question has been raised that difficulties may arise by one companv running an efficient service of steamers and the other an inefficient service. The Euphrates and Egris Steam Navigation Company (Limited), being assured of its proportion of the traffic, might lun obsolete steamers, while the Ottoman Company might put on new and fast steamers, fhis point is hardly worth consideration in view of the fact that the Euphiates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited), would for its own protecnon^endeavour to run steamers equally efficient to the steamers of the Ottoman Company in order to be in a position to carry its proportion as far as possible. 6 . In the event of the retirement or death of the concessionnaire, his successor to be agreed upon between the holders of the block of shares which he represents and the holders of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited), block of shares. Should they fail to agree, his successor to be appointed by the British Foreign Office. Such successor to undertake to carry out the terms of the present agreement, including article 4. Enclosure 5 in No. 1 . Board of Trade to Euphrates arid Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Sir, Board of Trade, June 14, 1912. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to inform you that your letter of the 9th June relative to certain proposed arrangements with respect to the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris Bivers and the enclosure therein, have now been carefully considered by the Board, and they desire me to offer the following observations thereon :— 1 . As you are aware, the efforts of the Board of Trade have been directed to giving effect to the undertaking of His Majesty’s Government embodied in a memorandum handed to Mr. Lynch at the Foreign Office on the 19th May, viz., that under certain conditions mentioned therein they would use their good offices to secure that certain financial and working arrangements specified in the memorandum should be made by the new company for the protection of the interests of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited). 2 . The Board understood that it was the desire of Mr. Lynch that a representative of your company should be placed in communication with the Board of Trade with a view of putting them m possession of the views of the company as to the best mode of giving effect to this memorandum before communicating with the concessionnaire. Accordingly, an interview took place at the Board between yourself and lepiesentatives of the department, a record of which was duly submitted to and revised by you, and was afterwards discussed between representatives of the Board of liade and Loid Inchcape. The Board gather from your letter under reply that your company take exception to this step, which I need hardly say was taken in the inteiests of all concerned The Board, however, are at a loss to understand what other course could have been adopted by them with any prospect of making progress towards a mutually satisfactory arrangement. 3 . As a result the Board of Trade handed to your company a note embodying in outline Lord Inchcape’s proposals for giving effect to the undertaking ot His Majesty s Government. These suggestions included proposals as to the share of capital to ie alloted to your company and the basis of a working agreement between the two companies, an offer to discuss with Mr. Lynch the question of any payment to be made under paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office memorandum, and a refusal to agree to an arrangement for joint local management.

The Board have not failed to note the statement in your letter implying that the demands contained in the enclosure represent the irreducible minimum requirements of your company. They hope, however, that this is not to be taken literally, as in that event they fear that no useful purpose would be served by continuing the discussion and they could only report to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that, owing to t e nature and extent of the demands put forward by .vour company, they have not been successful in promoting an arrangement on the lines of the undertaking given by His Majesys Government. It would then be for the Secretary of State to decide what further steps should be taken in the circumstances. The Board, however, trust that it may not be necessary to take this course. I have, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY. Enclosure 0 in No. 1. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to Board of Trade. 3, Salter s Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, Sir, June 20, 1913. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of yonr letter of the 14th instant, with respect to the arrangements under contemplation for the future of the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris. 1 . In reply I am to state that, when the memorandum of the Secretary of State was handed to our chairman on the 19th May, during the course of an interview accorded to him and myself at the Foreign Office, it was verbally explained to us that, subject to the control of the new Ottoman Company being vested in an outside concessionnaire, there was the strongest disposition on the part of our Foreign Office to meet our own requirements in the constitution of the new company. But, it was added, the Foreign Office did not feel itself competent to discuss the business side of the question with us. It had, therefore, placed that side in the hands of the Board of Trade, which, in its turn could be assisted by the best expert advice from outside. At this and at a subsequent interview, accorded to our chairman at the Foreign Office on the 21 st May, we were informed that the question of who the concessionnaire shall be was under consideration ; that certain names had been placed before the Secretary of’ State by the Board of trade. We were urged to accept the memorandum of the Secretary of State as a basis for negotiation, and to lose no time in the endeavour to make it amenable to ourwaTMW out’’ a reasonable agreement with the Board of Trade, which Chairman sen?to Mr W ? ^ iestlon - J was under these circumstances that our qi l ivTiv nn 1 e f’ a ^ ie ^ orei g n Office, his confidential memorandum of the '-/1st May, under cover of a letter requesting that nothing should be said to a prospective concessionnaire until we had ascertained whether it would be possible to “ hammer out” an arrangement, on the_ basis of the Secretary of State’s proposals, which would effectually safeguard the interests of this company. Our chairman gave strong verbal expression to his personal doubts as to the feasability of such an arrangement on that basis. 1 he proposal was that this company should be restricted in the future to the use ot three steamers only and a reserve steamer, while arrangements were to be hammered out under which, for a period of sixty years, it was to be enabled to live and prosper alongside of a new Ottoman company under British control, which, subject to our three steamers, was to be invested with exclusive rights of navigation, and with the fullest powers of expansion. It was, therefore, agreed that our chairman’s memo randum of the 21 st May should be regarded as quite non-committal and tentative. In pursuance of this course^ of procedure, I myself called at the Board of Trade and put forward certain suggestions which might form a basis for subsequent discussions, to be held upon the return of Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith. I had no idea that these suggestions would be communicated to a concessionnaire or, indeed, that any of the detailed information for which you asked on this and on previous occasions would go beyond ourselves. I respectfully submit that I was the more fully justified in this attitude in view of the understanding indicated in the eleventh paragraph of our chair man’s memorandum of the 6 th May, which, I understand, was submitted to you and accepted as correct, and also in view of the purely tentative nature of the discussions which I had been instructed to commence. 2 . My Board has learnt subsequently that the concessionnaire, had already been chosen when the Secretary of State’s memorandum of the 19th May was handed to us and that he had been kept in close touch with the negotiations. And, since the interview which I was accorded at the Board of Trade on the 26th May we have been informed by Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith that the Board proposes to confine itself to the part of an intermediary between the concessionnaire and ourselves. You will recognise that this creates for us a new situation, especially in view of the fact that you rule out certain of our proposals on the' ground that “ they have already been rejected by the concessionnaire.” It appears to us that the concessionnaire has been placed in a position to dictate his own terms and we cannot, therefore, see that any useful purpose would be served by a meeting with him as matters now stand. You inform us further that our proposals, as regards representation on the board of the new company and participation in the local management, go beyond the scope of the Secretary of State’s memorandum of the 19th May. With great respect we cannot see how they do. The casting vote and, therefore, the control would remain in the hands of the concessionnaire and there is nothing in the Secretary of State’s memorandum to exclude us from participation in the local management. The concessionnaire would, of course, prefer that his own firm should be enabled to extend itself from the seaboard to the interior, supported by the emoluments of the local management. It would mean to his firm a verv large increase in the windfall which has come their way. ^ We can fully understand his rejecting our proposals under this head. But for us participation in the local management and strong representation on the board are not merely material aims. They are essential safeguards. Unless we can be given a strong voice in the direction and management of the new company, we are better out of it altogether. 3 . Failing an arrangement on these lines, we would beg to^ refei to the request contained in the concluding paragraph of our despatch of the 9th instant. We are not afraid of competition ; but we claim to be placed in a position to meet it on equal terms. This company was originally formed to navigate the Euphrates and iigris on lines indicated in a despatch from the Foreign _ Office, wherein no mention was made of restrictions on the number of the steamers it might see fit to emp oy. le ur is steamers, which it is now proposed to transfer to a new Ottoman company under British control and management, with exclusive rights of navigation foi a perm o six y years, were not at that time in existence. If for political reasons His l ajes y s overnmen now prefer to abandon the amalgamation scheme, which, at the instance of our Government, we worked so hard to secure a year or two ago, anc o^ e ®P ^ company in being, this company should either be placed in a position to ea m ^ m u me m i s own vessels with its present proportion of the traffic, under a wor mg arrangemen wi the concessionnaire of the new company; or, failing such an arrangement, no nm whatever should be placed on the number of steamers it may employ.

Drait of Despatch from Board of Trade to Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. ^ THE Board of Trade have given careful consideration to your letter of the 20 th June, but the result does not modify the views of this Department as stated in their letter of the 14th instant. i-djj , i • i i ^ , With reo-ard to the earlier portion of your letter, the Board do not des.re to add to what was said in their previous letter, beyond observing that any misconception on vour part as to the extent to which the Board intended at any particular stage to acquaint the concessionnaire nominated by His Majesty’s Government with the views of parties interested could not, in the Board’s judgment, affect the present situation various in any material respect. . , . i 11 T • i In the recent negotiations between His Majesty s Government and the Imperial Ottoman Government, which form the foundation of the proposed new concession, provisions were included fully reserving to your company all the rights and privileges of navigation, which, so far as the Board understand, they have hitherto enjoyed or have had any reasonable expectation of enjoying. In these circumstances, the Board are of opinion that it is misleading to suggest, as your letter appears to do, that these provisions entail any fresh restriction upon your company with regard to the number of steamers to be employed. On the contrary, in the opinion of the Board no inconsiderable benefit is conferred upon your company by the enumeration and confirmation of its existing privileges in a new diplomatic instru ment, in view of the fact, of which you are doubtless aware, that there has hitherto been a divergence of view between the two Governments as to the tenure of these privileges. In addition to the above provisions in the declaration, His Majesty’s Government have undertaken to use their good offices to secure the conclusion of arrangements between your company and the proposed new company, including inter alia a working agreement to protect your company from unfair competition, besides provision for representation on the directorate and for participation on favourable terms in the capital of the new concern. It has already been intimated to you that, in the Board’s opinion, the details of the working agreement and other matters to be arranged can only be properly settled after mutual discussion between your representatives and the concessionnaire. If, contrary to the expectation of the Board, the concessionnaire should show himself, in the course of such discussion, unwilling to conclude a reasonable arrangement, the Board would not hesitate either to put pressure upon him or even, if necessary, to consider some modified scheme. Unless, however, and until this con tingency has arisen, the Board are of opinion that there is no occasion to consider either of the alternative courses suggested in your letter. In this connection I am to point out that it is not the case, as stated by you, that the Board have ruled out any of the proposals of your directors, on the ground merely that they have already been rejected by the concessionnaire. On reference to the Board s letter you will see that the only proposals as to which they have stated that they could not put pressure on the concessionnaire are those which, in their opinion, are outside the scope of the memorandum of the 19th May. If your directors should prefer to abstain from taking the necessary steps to secure the conclusion of the proposed arrangement, the Board, \a hile regretting their decision, have no power to interfere with their discretion. Should they, however, on recon sideration decide otherwise, the Board trust that an intimation to that effect will be given at an early date before the arrangements with regard to the new company y eac hed a stage which might render the conclusion of an arrangement more difficult. 7*r[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.!

But the communication of the negotiations to the prospective concessionnaire has seriously compromised the situation, and it would appear that we are unlikely to receive satisfaction on the lines that have been laid down. Under these circumstances my board trusts that you may be willing to discuss the matter further with us. At the same time, I am to state that the impression which we have received is' that the appointment of someone from outside to be the concessionnaire of the new company will be likely to produce an effect upon public opinion the reverse of that which you have informed us is the object of this appointment. If that be the case we are quite at a loss to know for what reason this third party is being substituted for ourselves in the formation of the new Ottoman company. 1 or years past we have been negotiating with the Turkish Government, at your instance, for the creation of such a company under our control. Vet, when the moment becomes favourable for getting the company formed, we are thrust upon one side in favour of a third party. It cannot surely be said that we have been instrumental in introducing German interests to the navigation of these rivers. Germany possessed powers under the Bagdad Railway Convention of placing steamers on the Euphrates and ligris tor the transport of railway material. Had we not stepped in, such German-owned^vesse s would now be plying on these waters. We succeeded in obtaining half this interest for Great Britain, and all the steamers ordered and now plying for this special purpose have been constructed in British yards under our supervision. We kept His Majesty s Government fully informed of this transaction. We have submitted everything that has come from the German side to His Majesty’s Government, being most careful not to commit ourselves in any way without the express sanction of our own 1 oreign Office. And we have always contended for the maintenance upon * es ® y at ® r ? ° British flag and of the British company as part of any completely satis j SOlUt q,i'the other hand, we have no hrrunrwhffihBVSand German interests if^' Vh? raV^ tS common enterprises rather than separated m distme un ei y p t the Mediterranean to Bagdad is P-bfy participation m any line that may he built s ' - , ■ n f t | lp m-gai water centring in Bagdad and German partmipatioii m o ji^j^ ^ ^ general settlement. ways might, we still venture to believe, be interests divided into watertight If not, we greatly fear that German and British mterest 8 a vioeu ^ ^ « ie compartments, will not only seek to U'^The German railway interest will prejudice of the economic interests of for irrigation come up work against the British navigation mteres • themselves on the side of cheap for serious discussion, German interests wi § , . n ^ aiding of a fresh schemes, resulting in the destruction of e^^ ma;n te na nce of the navigation crop of a railways. _ This would be _ Rivalrv between these interests might were made a joint British and German m ' qq scarcely seem in consonance suit the diplomacy of certain e v^o ed^rve the best^interests of Turkey, with the aims of British diplomacy 01 like 3 [2950 x— 1 ]2 l , plose and harmonious union of the two which would far ^ provinces of the Ottoman Empire. greatest commercial foi ces m tn - I I have, &amp;c. FRED. W. PARRY, Secretary. § Enclosure in No. 1. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Namgtion Company to Board of Trade. 3 Salters’ Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, ’ June 20, 1913. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with respect to the arrangements under contemplat.on for the future of the navrgat.on of the Euphrates and ^ when the memorandum of the Secretary of State the 19th May Sir, was WecTto 01 . 11 ^^^ on'th'e 19th May during the course of an interview rded to him and myself at the Foreign Office, rt was verbally explained to us that, mea to . ^ the new ottoman company being vested m an outside accor&lt; subject to the part of our Foreign Office the constitution of the new company. Rut, it was concessionnaire, ^^llT^X^noIYaitseS competent to discuss the business side of the question with us. It had therefore placed that side m the hands of the Board o Trade which in its turn could be assisted by the best expert advice from outside. At this and at a subsequent interview accorded to our chairman at the Foreign informed that the question of who the con- that certain names had been placed urged to accept Office on the 21st May, we were cessionnaire shall he was under consideration before the Secretary of State by the Board of Trade, vve were # the memorandum of the Secretary of State as a basis for negotiation, and to lose no time in the endeavour to make it amenable to our interests by hammering out ” a reasonable agreement with the Board of Trade, which w r as fully competent to deal with the question. It wms under these circumstances that our chairman sent to Mr. Parker at the Foreign Office his confidential memorandum of the 21st May, under cover of a letter requesting that nothing should be said to a prospective concessionnaire until we had ascertained whether it would be possible to “hammer out” an arrange ment, on the basis of the Secretary of State’s proposals, which w r ould effectually safe guard the interests of this company. Our chairman gave strong verbal expression to his personal doubts as to the feasibility of such an arrangement on that basis. The proposal was that this company should be restricted in the future to the use of three steamers only and a reserve steamer, while arrangements were to be “ hammered out under which, for a period of sixty years, it was to be enabled to live and prosper along side of a nevr Ottoman Company under British control which, subject to our three steamers, was to be invested with exclusive rights of navigation and with the fullest powers of expansion. It vms therefore agreed that our chairman’s memorandum of the 21st May should be regarded as quite non-committal and tentative. In pursuance of this course of procedure, I myself called at the Board of Trade and put forward certain suggestions which might form a basis for subsequent discussions, to be held upon the return of Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith. I had no idea that these suggestions would be communicated to a concessionnaire, or, indeed, that any of the detailed information for which you asked on this and on previous occasions would go beyond ourselves. I respectfully submit that I v r as the more fully justified in this attitude in view of the understanding indicated in the eleventh paragraph of our chairman’s memorandum of the 6 th May, which, I understand, was submitted to you and accepted as correct, and also in view of the purely tentative nature of the discussions which I had been instructed to commence. 2. My board has learnt subsequently that the concessionnaire had already been chosen when the Secretary of State’s memorandum of the 19th May was handed to us, and that he had been kept in close touch with the negotiations. And since the interview which I was accorded at the Board of Trade on the 26th May we have been informed by Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith that the Board proposes to confine itself to the part of an intermediary between the concessionnaire and ourselves. 1 : ou will recognise that this creates for us a new situation, especially in view of the fact that you rule out certain of our proposals on the ground that “ they have3 P rak Lotiii 'retaiyofl: ^ a Q mtent! 1 ; ffl OlltsJ foreign (| !■ Hk )f ttefeii m outside, i t tlie Foitig who it ; an m iffectualra ! r eiprtssi it prosper* S tooftte th tie 1* ; jrandi®^' pursue® t ' rrward ^ ieldupoif already been rejected by the concessionuaire.” It appears to us that the concessionaire has been placed m a position to dictate his own terms, and we cannot therefore see that any useful purpose would be served by a meeting with him as matters now stand. You inform us further that our proposals as regards representation on the hoard of the new company and participation in the local management go beyond the scope of the pcretary of State s memorandum of the 19th May. With great respect we cannot see how they do. ^ f he casting vote, and therefore the control, would remain m the hands of the concessionnaire, and there is nothing in the Secretary of Stated memorandum to exclude us from paiticipation in the local management. The concessionnaire would of course prefei that his own firm should be enabled to extend itself from the seaboard to the interior, supported by the emoluments of the local management. It would mean to his firm a very large increase in the windfall which has come their way. We can fully understand his rejecting our proposals under this head. But for us participation in the local management and strong representation on the hoard are not merely material aims ; they are essential safeguards. Unless we can be given a strong voice in the direction and management of the new company we are better out of it altogether. 3. Failing an arrangement on these lines, we would beg to refer to the request contained in the concluding paragraph of our despatch of the 9th instant. We are not afraid of competition, but we claim to be placed in a position to meet it on equal terms. This company was originally formed to navigate the Euphrates and Tigris on lines indicated in a despatch from the Foreign Office, wherein no mention was made of restrictions on the number of the steamers it might see fit to employ. The Turkish steamers, which it is now proposed to transfer to a new Ottoman company under British control and management, with exclusive rights of navigation for a period of sixty years, were not at that time in existence. If, for political reasons, His Majesty’s Government now prefer to abandon the amalgamation scheme which, at the instance of our Govern ment, we worked so hard to secure a year or two ago, and to keep this company in being, this company should either he placed in a position to deal in the future in its own vessels with its present proportion of the traffic, under a working arrangement with the concessionnaire of the new company, or, failing such an arrangement, no limit whatever should he placed on the number of steamers it may employ. We respectfully submit that this is a strictly reasonable request, though it may fall short of that share in the navigation of these waters which our past efforts may have entitled us to expect would he allotted to us on the present occasion.

Slr ’ T AW m n . 14, 1913. 1 AM directed by the Board of Trade to inform you that your letter of the Jth June, relative to pertain proposed arrangements with respect to the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, and the enclosure therein, have now been carefully considered by the Board, and they desire me to offer the following observations 1. As you are aware, the efforts of the Board of Trade have been directed to giving effect to the undertaking of His Majesty’s Government, embodied in a memorandum handed to Mr. Lynch at the Foreign Office on the 19th May, viz., that under certain conditions mentioned therein they would use their good offices to secure that certain financial and working arrangements specified in the memorandum should be made by the new company for the protection of the interests of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. 2. The Board understood that it was the desire of Mr. Lynch that a representative of your company should be placed in communication with the Board of Trade with a view of putting them in possession of the views of the company as to the best mode of giving effect to this memorandum before communicating with the concessionnaire. Accordingly, an interview took place at the Board between, yourself and represen tatives of the Department, a record of which was duly submitted to 9 and revised by you, and was afterwards discussed between representatives of the Board of Trade and Lord Inchcape. The Board gather from your letter under reply that your company take exception to this step, which I need hardly say was taken in the interests of all concerned. The Board, however, are at a loss to understand what other course could have been adopted by them with any prospect of making progress towards a mutually satisfactory arrangement. 3. As a result the Board of Trade handed to your company a note embodying in outline Lord Inchcape’s proposals for giving effect to the undertaking of His Majesty’s Government. These suggestions included proposals as to the share of capital to be allotted to your company and the basis of a working agreement between the two companies, an offer to discuss with Mr. Lynch the question of any payment to be made under paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office memorandum, and a refusal to agree to an arrangement for joint local management. On this the Board of Trade recommended Mr. Lynch, as representing your company, to enter into direct communication with Lord Inchcape, considering that matters had reached a stage at which a direct interchange of views presented the only prospect of making further advance towards an arrangement. 4. The Board, however, understand that you have not yet adopted the course suggested, and they also understand from your letter of the 11th June that youi company prefer that the enclosure to your letter should not at this stage be handed to Lord Inchcape. 1 1 1 i i • + -u In the circumstances, the Board can only observe that the scheme emoodied in tie enclosure to your letter adheres substantially to the proposal for joint local management already rejected by Lord Inchcape, and asks for half the British share of the directorate of the new company. The Board consider that in these two aspects your proposals go beyond the scope of the Foreign Office memorandum of the 19t 11 aj, an ‘ e -V r ‘° n ° ' see their way to put any pressure on Lord Inchcape with regard to these points, thoug ; they will be interested to learn the result of any direct discussion between your companj and the concessionaire on these points. . . -i „.p 5.

That the National Bank was to have any hanking business connected with the combine, but not to be the concessionnaire.

Lord Inchcape was prepared to offer the National Bank 15 per cent., retaining 52 per cent, himself, so as to have control. So much for the British side of the affair. The National Bank was to have the right to acquire any Turkish shares (which amount to 50 per cent, of the whole), but the Board of Trade made a condition, viz., that if the Bank did acquire any Turkish shares it must surrender its British shares to Lord Inchcape. The reason of this condition was that the Board of Trade feared the National Bank might otherwise acquire control of the enterprise, and thus rob Lord Inchcape of control. It has, however, now been suggested that if the statutes of the concession aie so worded that the British directors (over whom Lord Inchcape holds the contiol) vote en bloc, then there is no objection to the National Bank holding both British and T?Tirkisli- shares A great difficulty of this question is that Mr. Lynch s just claims must be considered. . -n June 12, 1913.

Grey to send this provisional reply to your letter of the 11 th June, to which a detailed reply will be sent when it has been minuted in the department. He would, as yon know, regret very much if the National Bank were to cease operations in Turkey, especially at the present time. Before long there will be operations relating to the financing of Turkey, in which it appears to me desirable that British capital should be associated on political grounds, though I am, of course, not competent to express any opinion on the financial attractions of such participation. He had hoped that the obstacles to British participation in the Bagdad Railway were, owing to our recent negotiations, on the eve of being removed, and be was on the point of expressing the hope that you would become one of the Biitish directors. With reference to what you write about Dr. Gwinner, he did not approach you with a view to direct negotiations between him and the National Bank, because we have only lust (on 10th June) made definite proposals to the German Embassy m reply to their suggestions, and until we know of the way in which our proposals are regarded it is obvfously premature to conclude anything definite with Dr. Gwinner &gt; He thinks, however, that there is advantage in your entering into negotiations with him, and l am instructing Mr. Parker to explain to you exactly what the position is m regard to this qUeSt A 0 s n to oil, the Board of Trade are still in communication with Mr Greenway, and we are endeavouring to reach a compromise which, while protecting the just mieiests of the original British applicant, will, we hope, be acceptable to you. -p + i The navigation concession was one in which several British hrms had manifested an interest Iono- before the National Bank did, and we obviously could not disregard theii claims Bn i is probable that more favourable terms may be arranged than those recently put before you, and the Board of Trade are in communication with Lord Inchcape on the subject.

THE character and present state of the negotiations which have been conducted on behalf of this company with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade in connection with the conditions which are in future to regulate the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris were explained to my Board to-day at a full meeting. After careful consideration I have been instructed to convey to you the following reply to y ou ^ letter of the 2nd instant, covering an aide-memoire embodying the views of Lord Inchcape :— The intimation contained in your letter under acknowledgment, to the eftect tnat the suggestions submitted in the very tentative conversation between myseif and Messrs. Stanley and Ashley at the Board of Trade have been placed before Loid Inchcape, has painfully surprised us. We were given to understand at the foreign Office that theBoard of Trade, assisted, possibly, by expert ^‘^AtlLTo be be in a position to “hammer out” with us the heads of a workng ag = t to be concluded between the proposed new Ottoman ^X^ dhmRtedTmv Board procedure indicated was that this agreement would then b e ybm.tted to my Bo l and to our legal advisers. We were particularly requested Inchcape at this stage, and we, for our part, requested (see our chairman^ iett the 21st and 27th ultimo) that before the agreement ^Arsons fo““his will be nothing should be said to a prospective conce^ communicated obvious after a perusal of our chanman h thi memoran dum was tentative to the Foreign Office.

Lora incncape j- i [2950 k—5]to this company, in some other form than that of fully paid up shares in consideration of their “ position as pioneers of the navigation.' In return for these ambiguous advantages and safeguards, my Board are asked to enter into certain guarantees and to forego certain claims. On the other hand, by the provisions of a diplomatic conveM tion, the concessionnaire would inherit the results of our lengthy negotiations with the Turkish Government at the instance of His Majesty’s Government and the interests which he represents would not only be extended from the seaboard to the interior, but would be placed in a position of primacy in relation to the navigation of the internal waters. With great respect, my Board is unable to regard these proposals, so interpreted, as serious business propositions. j „ Vx . , We have thought with His Majesty’s Government that for political reasons it mio-ht be best to forego the present favourable opportunity for reviving and carrying the amalgamation scheme and to keep this company in bemg._ We did not, however, anticipate that we should be invited to take a meiely suboidinate part in the revival j by British capital of the Ottoman company. We are the only parties who_ have established a claim to bring about this revival. Moreover, should we not be given a very effective say in the control and management of the new eoncern to be endowed with unlimited powers of expansion, any safeguards in the shape of freight and pooling arrangements would be wholly inadequate to withstand the changing circumstances of a long period of time. If the actual control is to be vested in other hands, we submit that it is only just that we shall be offered the largest possible share in the new concern compatible with the holding and keeping by the concessionnaire of such actual control. We submit further that only in this way would there be any prospect for the survival and continued prosperity of the British company. I have the honour to enclose a memorandum containing the outlines of such an arrangement, framed in such a way as not to run counter to the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, while, at the same time, protecting, as we hope would be the case, the interests of our own company. The task has been a difficult one, and we do not see our way to whittling down any further the requirements contained therein which Ave submit are strictly reasonable. Alternatively, we would respectfully request His Majesty’s Government either to revive the amalgamation scheme or to arrange in the convention under negotiation with Turkey that the British company shall be endowed with powers of expansion at least sufficient to enable it to deal in the future with its present proportion of the traffic.

The local agents shall establish separate offices for the new Ottoman Company, at each ot which a iurkish mudir shall be employed. ' 4. The concessionnaire to agree on behalf of himself and of Messrs. Gray Dawes and Co. in London, together with their agencies and connected firms that neither he nor the} nor any oi then xespectrve agents or servants shall buyer acquire shares of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited). The Euphrates and ligris Steam Navigation Company (Limited) and the concessionnaire to agree that they will neither of them, directly or indirectly, acquire any further shares or interest m the new Ottoman Company beyond the shares originally to be allotted to them, except by mutual consent. 5. The concessionnaire to undertake that a working agreement between the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited) and the Ottoman Company shall be concluded as follows :— It is assumed that the controllers of the two concerns are animated by the desire to arrive at a permanent understanding whereby undue competition on the rivers shall be prevented and the interests of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited) and the Nahrieh Company alike shall be effectually protected, while at the same time affording means fully to provide for the expansion of trade. But, inasmuch as the Euphrates and Tigris Company’s fleet is arbitrarily limited to three steamers and their barges, while there is to be no limit to the fleet of the new Ottoman Company it becomes in the first place necessary, in order to arrive at a working arrangement, that each company should be allotted its fair proportion of the actual traffic. The statistics for the last five years, 1908-12 inclusive, establish the average quantity of the traffic carried by each company as follows :— Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited) : 52 per cent, equals thirteen-twenty-fifths of the whole. Nahrieh Company : 48 per cent, equals twelve-twenty-fifths of the whole. If we confine ourselves to the last two years, 1911-12, the proportions work out as follows :— Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited) : 56 per cent, equals fourteen-twenty-fifths of the whole. Nahrieh Company : 44 per cent, equals eleven-twenty-fifths of the whole. It would only be fair to apportion the traffic on the actual conditions of fourteen- twenty-fifths to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited , and eleven-twenty-fifths to the Nahrieh Company. But, as the fleet of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company is restricted, the extent to which this comnany could avail themselves of the benefit of this proportion would, ot course, be governed by the carrying capacity of this restricted fleet, ihe new Ottoman Company would derive the benefit of any further increase in trade. _ The machinery to carry out this arrangement would be the following . Each company would deal with its own shippers independently But a clearing house would be established at Bagdad, to he administered by a Board of two controllers, 0116 X dS/the SdNould consist of apportioning and adjusting the quantity of ca'go and passengers between the two lines of steamers f^tfl pat” r. • 7 l ^ -l a -raocacmo-Arq liqts showing - total quantity ot cargo and. passengers freight manifests and passengers j d would be handed into the clearing carried and freight and passage money receivea wo eomnanv house at the termination of each voyage o eaci s . 1 '' a t o total euantitv At the end of each month, or at any other convenient period the total quantity of tht traffic would he computed and the amount carried by each hue of steamers4 iMi / m%w * §4 V i 11 t L 5 ' I i or less than its ascertained.

No rebates or commissions other than those mutually agreed would be permitted. The above arrangement would provide for the carnage of any quantity of cargo the trade demanded, as the Ottoman Company would be able to expand its Ireightage capacity by increasing its fleet, while the Euphrates and Tigris bteam Navigation Company (Limited), would be secured in obtaining its proportion of the trade, as limited by the capacity of its steamers. Moreover, it would have the effect of preventing the Ottoman Company from putting on steamers not required by the trade. A question has been raised that difficulties may arise by one company running an efficient service of steamers and the other an inefficient service. _ The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited), being assured of its proportion of the traffic, might run obsolete steamers, while the Ottoman Company might put on new and fast steamers. This point is hardly worth consideration in view of the fact that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company would, for its own protection, endeavour to run steamers equally efficient to the steamers of the Ottoman Company in order to be in a position to carry its proportion as far as possible. 6 . In the event of the retirement or death of the concessionnaire, his successor to he agreed upon between the holders of the block of shares which he represents and the holders of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Limited), block of shares. Should they fail to agree, his successor to be appointed by the British Foreign Office.

[May 13. i CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [22078] No. 1 . Minute by Mr. Parker. AN interview took place to-day between Hakki Pasha, Sir H. LI. Smith, and Sir A. Hirtzel and myself regarding the Mesopotamian navigation question : the discussion on this subject was only tentative, and I need make no record of it, as it was arranged that a further interview should take place on Friday afternoon. (I may, however, mention parenthetically that we subsequently ascertained from Lord Inchcape that he is prepared to put up 100,0001. to buy Lynch out from the navigation, or to co-operate with Lynch if he cannot be bought out.) The question of the Turkish veto on Egyptian borrowing powers then came up for discussion ; and Sir H. LI. Smith and Sir A. Hirtzel then left. I showed Hakki Pasha the draft declaration providing for the renunciation of the veto by Turkey,—the draft being based on a telegram just received from Lord Kitchener. Hakki Pasha said that this was the most difficult question of all, as Turkey could not abandon her right of veto without parliamentary consent, and that Tewfik Pasha would speak to Sir A. Nicolson on the subject. I asked him if he could suggest any change of wording, as he seemed specially to object to the proposed form of declaration (annexed). He said he would think it over ; but he repeated that it was a very difficult point to settle. I replied that this was very unfortunate, as His Majesty’s Govern ment had from the first made the removal of the veto a principal condition of their assent to the customs increase. He then suggested that a possible way of meeting the case would be for Turkey to agree now to one very large loan to be raised in instalments over a number of years. I said that I was convinced that nothing short of an absolute renunciation of the right of veto would be satisfactory. Hakki Pasha then said that the Porte had been much disturbed by the joint note sent in by the British and Russian Governments on the 3rd May about the Turco- Persian frontier, as Turkey had expected far more compensation in Zohab for her conciliatory attitude elsewhere. I replied that I had seen the note (of which he had a copy), and, looking on the question historically, I was much struck by the advantageous concessions made to Turkey. He said that, as his name was mentioned in the joint note, the note had been referred to him, and could I help him, by going over the proposed line on the map, to advise the Turkish Government as to the reasons for accepting the joint note. I said that I was not authorised to discuss this question, and that I must first ask for permission to do so. He said that as his only object was to reach a settlement, surely there could be no objection to unofficial conversation. I said I would let him know after speaking to Sir Arthur Nicolson. He then said the Russian attitude was most unreasonable : they even claimed that Vazne was Persian,—a place which had been incontestably Turkish for centuries. I said that as it was in the “ disputed zone ” the ownership was clearly contested; but as a matter of fact Sir Henry Rawlinson, an impartial witness, described it m 1844 as Persian.

I explained that Sir E. Grey would be glad if the National Bank could act as hankers of the combine ; and, in the course of further discussion, when it appeared that it would be difficult to reconcile Mr. Lynch’s claims in regard to participation with Lord Inchcape’s necessities as regards participation in order that he might have control, I enquired if this could not be arranged by allotting some of the Turkish shares to the National Bank, which is a Turkish institution. Lord Inchcape said he thought this would be a very good arrangement, and he asked that he might be placed in immediate communication with Sir H. Babington-Smith, as he (Lord Inchcape) wants to be able to commence negotiations as to the terms of the concession as soon as possible with Hakki Pasha, rather than have to send someone out to Constantinople for this purpose. I have accordingly prepared a draft to Sir H. Babington-Smith intimating that Sir E. Grey has selected Lord Inchcape as the concessionnaire, and that he will call at the National Bank of Turkey to-morrow to discuss the financial arrangements. The participation of the National Bank in the Turkish half of the company would in no wav invalidate the British control of the enterprise as a whole. J A. P. Foreign Office, May 22, 1913.

[22483] No. 1. L »Qlayl5.] dL k | SeCL'ION 1. Minute by Mr. Malkin respecting the Navigation of the Mesopotamian Rivers. I UNDERSTAND from Mr. Parker that Sir A. Hirtzel considers it essential to obtain a legal opinion as to whether His Majesty’s Government or Messrs. Lynch are the real concessionnaires for navigation on these rivers, in particular the Tigris, he., whether Messrs. Lynch’s service of steamers is carried on under a concession granted to them by the Turkish Government or under rights held by His Majesty’s Government, and transferred or leased to Messrs. Lynch by them. It would have been preferable to have obtained the opinion of the Law Officers, but in view of the enormous mass of papers which they would have to consider in order to form an opinion, and of the existing parliamentary and legal vacation, it appears that it would be impossible to consult them in time, as the matter is rather urgent, so I have been asked to give my opinion for what it is worth. The answer to the question put by Sir A. Hirtzel must depend on the instrument under which these rights of navigation are held. This point has been the subject of prolonged controversy with the Porte, and cannot be said to have been by any means settled. It is dealt withxin an exhaustive Library memorandum (Confidential, 10207) which has recently been prepared, and the references in this minute are to that document, It appears to me that there are three instruments or arrangements which may be pointed to as the foundation for the rights at present exercised by Messrs. Lynch, and that theyhave all been relied on at various stages of the controversy : (a.) The arrangement of 1846 (pp. 15-19). (b ) The vizierial letter of 1861 (pp. 25-27) considered as equivalent to a grant ot a special permission by the Porte, and although reciting the firmans of 1834 and 1841 and the arrangement of 1846, being in effect a new and independent afiam (c.) The firmans of 1834 and 1841 (pp. 8 and 10-11) regarded as being confirmed, in the case of the particular rights enjoyed by Messrs. Lynch, by the vizienal. letter of 1861. The question which of these three is really the foundation of the rights m question is one of the greatest difficulty. If the conclusions at which I have arrived are sound it Ts unnecelary, in this connection, to attempt to decide it, and it will suffice to ccnsider^he three alternative^m the origina l foundation of the rights in It should he sa a \ J?’ i Q t&gt;o-p pyIpu! on the ground that they have question, they can now be defended a ^ not tfenAhat this much Effects been freely exercised for about hail a century, our i uo the question now under discussion. «,) If these rights are denved feom ^ -ange-nt clear that Messrs. Lynch to“te interpretation put upon it by His Under the arrangement of 1846 ( a ^ COI( ^ , navigate the Mesopotamian rivers, Majesty’s Government) British vesse s w , . i f r0 m His Maiesty’s Government, and' Messrs.

Bulwer the Porte, His Majesty’s Government being only [2917 p —1] - . 30 COPY TO IN •' IA 30 MAY 1913 SF’2 i • • 4 .- ^ Mpqq™ Lvnch to obtain what they wanted. I n this was instrumental m assis1 ^ that thJ Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke connection it may be pomted ( p . 25 ) and that Her Majesty’s Government, of applying for a firma • htg u n(j er the arrangement ot 1846 were doubtfiil while not admitting that Uhertv “ to apply to the Porte to grant some further' told Sir H. M wer tha ^ facts seem to indicate that the grant Messm Lgich^d alternative is to regard Messrs. Lynch’s righte as derived from the finnans of 1834 -d 1841 confirmed by the viz^ gran ted in favour rffe Majesty's 6 Government and there may thus be on the face of it some ground for holding S hfessm Lvnch hold their rights from His Majesty s Government being somewhat in the position of sub-tenants. On the whole, however, I do not think that tine contention can be sustained. From a strictly legal point of view, it seems clear that if Messrs. Lynch hold then rights from His Majesty’s Government, to whom they were originally granted by the Porte this must be in virtue of a grant from His Majesty s Government to Messrs. Lynch The situation could not be arrived at in consequence of an arrangement made between the Porte and Messrs. Lynch. Now there is, so far as I am aware, no document in existence under which His Majesty’s Government granted or sub-leased their rights to Messrs. Lynch ; and the narrative given on pp. 24-27 shows m my opinion conclusively that nothing was further from the minds of Her Majesty s Govern ment in 1860 and 1861 than to transfer their rights under the firmans of 1834 and 1841 to Messrs. Lynch. These firmans were not mentioned at all by Her Majesty s Government at the time ; what they had in mind throughout was the arrangement of 1846 ; the firmans are mentioned for the first time in the vizierial letter itself, and even then Sir H. Bulwer, in sending the letter home, speaks of it as “ confirmatory of the arrangement of 1846 ” (p. 26). The probable explanation is that His Majesty s Government had not these firmans in mind at all, but in any case I do not think there is anything which can be pointed to as amounting, on the facts, to a transfer or sub-lease of their rights under them to Messrs. Lynch. From a strictly technical point of view, this would appear to dispose of the point, but the case is a very unusual one, and it is easy to attach too much weight to technicalities. It may be argued that the Porte has always treated Messrs. Lynch’s rights as derived from the firmans of 1834 and 1841, and that His Majesty’s Government have to a large extent accepted that view. I do not think however that, even accepting these facts, they establish that Messrs. Lynch’s rights are held from or through His Majesty’s Government. I think that the most that could be said is that His Majesty’s Government have tacitly accepted an arrangement under which the rights flowing from these firmans were exercised by Messrs. Lynch (though the existence of the “ Comet ” shows that His Majesty’s Government continue to some extent to maintain these rights) not in virtue of a grant from His Majesty s Government, but because His Majesty’s Government more or less accepted an arrangement by which their rights were transferred to Messrs. Lynch by the Porte. In any case, I have not found anything to indicate that His Majesty’s Government has ever suggested, or contended, that Messrs. Lynch hold their rights from or through them, while, on the other side, there is the explicit statement, made in 1884 both to Musurus Pasha and in Parliament, that “ Her Majesty’s Government contend that the Vizierial letter of 1861, having been issued for the very purpose of enabling the company to put their two steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates, was intended to confer, and did confer, that privilege on them ” (p. 69), a clear assertion that Messrs. Lynch derive their rights from the Porte and not from His Majesty’s Government. On the whole, therefore, I am of opinion that whatever the source of Messrs. Lynch s rights, they are held from the Porte, and not from, or through, His Majesty s Government. The question to what extent His Majesty’s Government’s rights under the firmans of 1834 and 1841 are still in existence, as distinct from those now exercised by Messrs. Lynch, is one which it does not appear necessary to consider at this moment. May 15, 1913. H. W. M.(Xaa Mr. Malkin has asked me to read his preceding memorandum and opinion and to add anything ^ that occurs to me thereon. As it appears to be considered that immediate action is necessary it is of course quite clear that time does not suffice for consulting the Law Officers who, in order to form an independent opinion when they Returned from their vacation, would have to go through a huge mass of papers and to master the printed memorandum which is annexed. In order to form an independent opinion I should^ have to do the same, which would cause very considerable delay, besides making it necessary for me to suspend all my other work for some time. Mr. Malkin is familiar with the case already, and has devoted great care to the opinion which he has given. On reading that opinion and considering the arguments set forth by Mr. Malkin, I am convinced that if the facts, and the effect of those facts, has been correctly stated (as I do not for a moment question that it has been), the result is that Messrs. Lynch hold from the Porte direct and not from, or through, His Majesty’s Government. It might perhaps be worth while to suggest to the India Office that they should consult their own able legal adviser, Mr. Sale, independently on the matter, or at any rate ask him whether he concurs generally with Mr. Malkin’s opinion before action is taken upon it. I do not think that this is necessary so far as this Office is concerned, and merely suggest it as Sir A. Hirtzel appears to he rather anxious as to the legal positiori^knd might be glad to have our view confirmed by the Legal Adviser of his own Secretary of State. If Mr. Sale dissented I think we should have to go to the Law Officers however, and this would cause considerable delay. W. K, D. May 15, 1913. tit i: y (jZa hCT £svVX^(f\A/$ (X~ .

Lynch Brothers from participation in the local management of the new Company, then it would be in our view an wholly inadequate recognition of our existing position of primacy on tne rivers and oi our efforts in the past to bring about an amalgamation ox the steamer services under our management. It will be recognised that the principal source of profit is to be found in the advantages and emoluments derivable from the local management. We must therefore await the details of the proposed working agreement between the two Companies before expressing any further opinion. lie have, moreover, expended within quite recent years an immense amount of personal labour and effort, in addition to a sum of s everal thousands of pounds, in endeavouring to bring about, at the instance of His Majesty'sMajesty's Government, an amalgamation of the steamer services. This amalgamation was defeated by German diplomacy . But we have now been invited by the representa tives of German interests in these regions to revive a scheme of this nature with some German participation. Acting with complete loyalty, we have kept His Majesty's Government correctly and fully informed of these overtures. Under these circumstances, we are unable to believe that His Majesty's Government do actually contemplate the relegation of our firm and company to a secondary position on the rivers of Mesopotamia, but this in turn depends upon the details of the scheme and the extent of participation in the share capital and management of the new Company to be accorded to us. On the other hand, we consider it not unreasonaole that others should be asked to take part in the enterprise. His Majesty's Government will, however, recognise tnat it must be of the greatest importance to us to secure colleagues conversant to some extent with the nature of the business on hand and with whom we might hope to work fruitfully and amicably. We would, therefore, suggest the following arrangement and we shall oe glad to .mow within thetrie next few days whether it is approved. hi© Concessionaire oi the new Company to 'be either Lord Inchcape or Mr. W. A. Buchanan of the firm of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company of Busrah, .agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited. The first British Directors to be agreed upon by mutual consent between the Concessionaire and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company, Limited. The local management to be conducted in such a way as to meet Turkish susceptibilities but to be under the charge of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company at Busrah and of Messrs.Lynch Brothers at Baghdad and other internal ports. Incidentally we may point out tnat an arrangement of this kind would be essential to the due execution Ox a working agreement between the two Companies and to their economical administration. Provided acceptable working arrangements can be ensured and their e: , j..i~ —■p='''.t&gt;T-ded, I should be disposed nd their e: 1 to advise the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company Limited, while claiming themselves a substantial participa tion in the British share of the new Company,to allow the actual controlling shares to be in the hands of the tion in the Coneessionaire.

There remains the position of Mr Lynch in regard to (1) his existing rights and (2) the new Company* I understand that Lynch is coming to the Foreign Office on Monday, when the statement of the British rights annexed to the ’’Declaration ' will he explained to him and he will he asked to accept it, with what result we must ’’wait and see 1 *. Meanwhile I have discussed with Lord Inchcape the extent to which he v^rould he willing if he takes up the matter to meet Lynch with regard to his position in relation to the new Company. The enclosed statement (which can if thought well he shewn or given to Lynch on Monday) is the result of this discussion, and I think that on the whole it is very satis factory. Practically Lord Inchcape will admit Lynch to almost any degree of participation which does not give him the control or management of the new enterprise, and V/ ..ill also console him for any (imaginary) curtailment of rights under his own concession hy a reasonable payment in cash or shares. . ~ + v,i s as I feel that it is difficult I am very glad of this as .. ,„ st t0 Lynch whose very obvious faults for us to be quite just to uyno n tH e fact that for many years he has been a pioneer conceal the iacu . . „ ., rtd is justified in expecting some in the river navigation, . j. -p -&gt;-*-? cpV\+p in the mattei* priority of rights in I am, Yours sincerely, ($d.)

These negotiations — facilitated by the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade — are between Ibrahim Hakki Pasha and Lord Inchcape (James Lyle Mackay), and also involve the formation of a new Anglo-Turkish Company to operate the concession. It is equally concerned with insuring that Henry Finnis Blosse Lynch and his firm the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company are compensated for the introduction of the new company and provided with a suitable stake in the new concern. Both Mr Lynch and Lord Inchcape employ solicitors to represent them, these firms being Messrs Slaughter and May, and Messrs Walters and Company respectively. The negotiations between the two do not proceed smoothly; the file therefore includes discussion by British officials of Mr Lynch's 'intrigues', particularly in Germany (e.g. folios 85-94), to influence negotiations for the new concession in his favour. It also includes counter complaints from Mr Lynch about his treatment by the Foreign Office, and against statements made about his company in the House of Commons by the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, on the 22 July 1913 (e.g. folios 10-26).There is also some discussion in the file of British interests in limiting German access to the Tigris and Euphrates, whether Britain should secure an interest for itself in the Baghdad Railway, and insuring that Britain obtains a suitable stake in any new port built at Basra. There is also some debate respecting the extent the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company is able to exercise the rights of its original concession from 1862, and its prospects for expansion.Most of the correspondence in the file is between officials representing the Board of Trade, the Foreign Office, and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. The Foreign Office is principally represented by Alywyn Parker. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company on the other hand by Fred W Parry and Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Philip Picot. Numerous copies of the draft concession between the Ottoman authorities and Lord Inchcape can be found throughout the file; often including an additional copy in French.Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Henry Finnis Blosse Lynch</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>James Lyle Mackay</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Henry Philip Picot</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Board of Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Ibrahim Hakki Pasha</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Tigris River</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Euphrates River</geographic></subject><subject><topic>River navigation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000115#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
