His Highness The Sultan Saiyid Taimur Bin Faisal bin Turki. TERRITORY. Oman in its geographical sense represents the South Eastern comer of the Arabian Peninsula from Trucial Oman in the forth to the borders of Hadhramaut. Politically speaking, the Sultanate consists of the littoral extending from Ras Musandam at the entrance of the Persian Culf along the East and South coasts to Ras Fartak in Central South Arabia, a coast line of 1,100 miles, together 'ith the overseas possession of G-wadar, an important Aekran port which handles the trade of much of Southern British Baluchistan and South Eastern Persia, and is situated on the Imperial Air Route to India. Zanzibar, once attached to the Sultanate of Oman, but now a British Protectorate, formerly made a yearly payment, now paid by the Government of India from Indian Revenues, to the Muscat Treasury, and the Zanzibar Ruling Family is a collateral branch of the A1 Sa'id Dynastic family of Oman, whose head is the Sultan. HISTORICAL . This maritime Arab Stats is believed by some to have been the original home of the Phoenicians: its sailors carried the trade between Babylonia and India, and its seas were the cradle of navigation. Oman figures before the rise of I slain as an appanage of Persia, and in turn fell into the hands of the Abbaside Caliphs of Baghdad, but from the Middle Ages onwards secured independence under its own native rulers. The present dynasty rose in 1741. Napoleon, to further his Indian designs, regarded the Sultanate as of sufiicient importance to seen to establish relations with its ruler, but the period of greatest prosperity came unaer tne Sultan Saiyid Sa'id, the great-grandfather of the present/present Sultan, who reigned from 1807 to 1356, under whose rule the fortunes of Unseat attained their zenith, and who not merely played a leading part in the Persian Gulf, but invaded and colonised Zanzibar and the adjacent East African territory. He presented a frigate to our Royal Navy and received another, the M Prince Regent 11 , in return. I'he Sultanate has since then diminished gradually in importance. Internal disaffection and rebellion have restricted the authority of the Sultan to the coastal districts. British policy has throughout this later period been chiefly concerned with suppressing (a) the Slavs Trade ana (o) the Arms Traffic. Both had their centre in .luscat, which derived from them great wealth. Luscat was the slave market for South East Arabia and the Armoury for European arms destined to be smuggled across the Persian Gulf for Afghanistan, Baluchistan and the North Test Frontier. Both have disappeared largely through the activities of the Royal Navy and the collaboration of the Sultan under Treaty obligations. STEAL. FEAT ERE S. The dominant physical features of Oman are (1) a lofty range of mountains running almost parallel wion the coast, the great backbone of the country rising to a height o.l 10,000 xeet in Jebel Akdhar, (II) a coastal plain notable for a date grove one hundred and fifty miles long and from three to seven miles in depth, (III) beyond the mountains, the immense unpenetrated spaces of Ruba al Khali, which have hitherto baffled explorers. The deep waters off one Oman coasts render navigation simple, and muscat is a safe harbour as well as being a very beautiful one. summer climate is intensely hot and there is scarcely any difference between day and night temperatures. It was of Encircled by precipitous volcanic cliffs, its Muscat/Muscat that the Persian poet wrote 'Ana here, the panting sinner receives a foretaste of his future destiny”. The average rainfall varies between three and six inches. POPULATION . The total population of Oman has been estimated at 500,000, representing perhaps 15$ of the entire population of the Arabian peninsula: 80% of these are tribal Arabs, there is a considerable pure negro element generally in domestic service, and a less numerous foreign trading element, which consists of British Indians, Persians and Baluchis. There is, however, a large admixture of African blood in the population at large, as also in the Ruling Family. PRODUCTS AND TRADB . The overseas trade is largely with Bombay, Aden and Zanzibar, though America takes a considerable portion of Oman’s date crop for her own black population. The fisheries, chiefly shark for export to the Far East, are of second importance to the date industry. The camels of Oman are famous throughout Arabia, but the country is too thirsty to allow the horse to flourish and very few are bred. Indigo dyeing, copper and brass work and cloth weaving are among other industries, and there is a crude bu^ characteristic variety oi gold and silver work, especially used for sheaths and mountings of daggers and swords. The State religion is the Ibadhi sect of Islam, v/hich is elsewhere found in Lorocco. Fiercely intolerant of other ereeas, Oman has been traditionally hostile to foreign penetration, and the eultan himself, disapproved of for his imidel associations, has himself never deeued it expedient to visit the interior mountains. The tenets of Ibadhism, in their puritanical narrowess, resemble the Wahabism of Central Arabia. gQVBM:::?:? . /GQ.VjSRN:^T . The Government of the Sultanate is patriarchal or feudal, and judged by western bureaucratic standards is without much system or efficiency, but it admirably suits the conditions and needs of the inhabitants. At one time a theocracy, the religious functions have been dropped by later Sultans in favour of an elected Imam. JT (b) His Highness The Sultan Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal bin Turki, K.C.I.K., C.S.I. The Sultan succeeded his father in 1913, when he was 27 years old, so that his age is now 42 and he has been ruling for lb years. /_ In appearance ho is bulky, of middle height and distinguished looking,J Slow of speech, he is regarded by Europeans as possessing Arab charm and dignity. As a young man he passed through a phase of 'religious bigotry'. But he has long since outgrown it. A sign of this is his fondness for smoking, which practice is anathema to the strict Ibadhi. He, however, remained a good Muslim in that he is a teetotaler. He is popular with his subjects: is not politically minded outside the boundaries of his own State: is proud of and loyal to his British alliance and was awarded the (honorary) O.S. I. in 1917 and the (honorary) K.C.I.E. in 1926. He has three sons, the eldest of whom, Saiyid Sa’id, is being educated at an Arab School in Baghdad. The Sultan has suffered in health for many years and will undergo an operation for appendicitis in England. His lon &amp; absences from Muscat on tnis account led him some years ago to wish to abdicate in favour of his eldest son - a course he was dissuaded from taking by our counsels. He has paid many visits to India where, at Dehra Dun, he possesses a bungalow, but spends most of his time at Dhofar in South Arabia on his Crovm Estates. There he has a residence and some/some snooting. His chief interest is 'shikar 9 of the kind that the desert provides, gazelle, antelope, and an occasional panther. Hut he is a lover of sport and open air life generally, and in spite of his health last year undertook a 300-mile camel journey northwards from muscat through his country. He has made a fine collection of Arab books, but his scholarship is limited and he knows little of any language but his own. As an Arab chief he is of necessity a poor man as compared with certain of the Indian Ruling Princes, his annual State revenues scarcely amounting to £100,000, but the historic importance attaching to his office is suggested by his salute of 21 guns. The Sultanate is not a British Protectorate. In law it has sovereign status, and its independence is guaranteed by the joint Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. Besides its Treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, it has Treaty relations with France c*nd tne United States of America. Before the Great War these Powers had consuls stationed at Muscat, and France still communicates directly with the Sultan, as does the League of Nations. In practice, however, British influence in the State is paramount.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0003c0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B390</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0003c0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B390</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Memorandum.
