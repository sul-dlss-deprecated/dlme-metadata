No. 782 x ~~— Man amah February 17, 1948• CorCJeafciaL BAHRAf'T Data.,,. It is difficult to give accurate replies to some of the questions in your letter No. C/f81 of 9th Feby. 1948, in which you ask for information about the num ber of Persians now in Bahrain. According to the census taken in 1940, which was the first census ever made in Bahrain, 7,547 persons were registered as be ing Persian subjects, that is to say at the time of the census they described themselves as Persian nationals but it cannot be assumed that these were the only people of Persian nationality then resident in Bahrain. We did not go into the question of nationality very tho roughly at that time, our object was to make a count of the population, so many people who were not Bahrain sub jects may have described themselves as Bahrain subjects. The number of Persians in Bahrain has increased very con siderably since then, during 1945, 1946 and 1947 about 3,000'Persians entered Bahrain, with travel documents mostly from Dubai and Sharjah, describing them as sub jects of those states, but as many of these Persians scarcely knew a word of Arabic it was obvious that they were not genuine residents of the Trucial Coast. We believe that the number of Persians who have entered the country illegally is not much less than the number who have come with passes. When once they get to Bahrain very few Persians seem to leave the country, except on visits to Persia from which they return. Apart from the census returns we have no figures showing the number of Persians in Bahrain so I cannot give an estimate sup ported by facts but I am of the opinion that there are not less than £0,000 Persians now living in Bahrain, byby this figure I mean people who claim to be Persian subjects. As you know according to our nationality rules everyone who is born in Bahrain and who is not registered as a foreigner is counted to be a Bahrain subject. At present there is a tendency for people who are not legally Bahrain subjects to claim Bahrain nationality, mainly be cause passport facilities and employment are simplified for Bahrain subjects, but Persians who are Bahrain subjects in Bahrain become very definitely Persian as soon as they set foot in their own country and they all acquire Persian travel documents while in Persia. 2. The number of people in Bahrain who are regis tered as being entitled to rations is now 105,000, but as many people do not draw rations I believe the total popu lation may be considerably more than this figure. I am still of the opinion that the population is about equally divided between Sunnis and Shias, the latter sect includes Persians and Hassawis. I entirely disagree with the re port quoted in para 2 of your letter. The Bahama are not Persians and would strongly object to being described as such. Admittedly they are of the same sect as the Persians but apart from this they have little in common with Persians and they are more closely connected with the Arabs of Bahrain than with the Persians who live in Bahrain. None of the country Bahama speak Persian and only a few the town. A Bahama have.intermarried with UU A them K in those cases it has almost invariably been Bahama men who have taken Persian wives, not Bahcss^i girls who have been given in marriage to Persian men. When Persian women are absorbed into Bahama families they seem to acquire the Bahama point of view and are hardly distin guishable from Bahama. In spite of their common reli gion Persiansand Bahama keep themselves entirely sepa-3- separate in religious matters, they do not generally worship in the same mosques, they have separate matems and, to a certain extent, in Manamah, they occupy different districts in the town* There are no Persians living in the Bahama villages. 3# I have recently discussed the question of Persian influence in Bahrain with a number of different people and all that I have heard lately supports my own previous opin ion which is that the Bahama as a whole have no sympathy or liking for the Persians. The villagers know little about the Persians and have little contact with them and they form the majority of the Bahama; the Manamah Bahama, who are better educated, who travel more and who are interested in politics, would not welcome Persiem rule in spite of their inherent dislike of the Ruling Family which is based upon the fact that the Ruling Family now own the property which used to belong to the Bahama and also because many of the older men remember the oppressive measures of the Ruling Family in the past. There are however among the town Bahama individuals who have strong personal reasons for disliking the present regime, such as the ex-Qadi, Shaikh Abdullah bin Mohomed Saleh and others, and who would be will ing to intrigue with Persia though they would not come out into the open and if they tried to get support from the Bahama community as a whole they would meet with no success«j I feel that I should say that because the Bahama regard me as their supporter they talk to me very freely about their feelings and their political aspirations. 4. There are three different categories of Persians in Bahrain, Persian Shias 'Ajen', Persian Sunnis and Holis, the last two categories overlap. The Persian Shias are far the most numerous, they include most of the coolies, boatmen, bakers, small shopkeepers, coffee shop proprietors, domestic servants, taxi drivers, many of the water carrierscarriers and some important merchants who trade princi pally with Persia. Some of them are Bushiris and Kazer- roonis and most of them are from the Persian littoral. The Persian school provides for the education of many of their sons though some attend the Grovernment schools. They have their own matems, for men and for women, their own club, the Firdosi Club, and their own mosques. Taken as a whole they are a poor, harworking community. Many of them live in Barastis and few of them own property* The majority of them live in Manamah though there is a PersianShia community in Muharraq. Their language is Persian and in many cases, especially among the women, they speak no Arabic. In this community, who have very little to lose, there are certainly many who would like to see Bahrain taken over by Persia. They suffer certain disadvantages at present through being foreigners and they probably imagine that under a Government of their own kind and creed they would enjoy a better position than they do now. There are young men among them who are sympathetic to the 'Tudeh' movement. During recent years a certain amount of propaganda literature has been brought into Bahrain from Persia but it appears to be mostly directed against the old fashioned Shia religious beliefs and obser vances and is frowned upon by the older generation of Per sian Shias. 5. The Sunni Persians include a number of wealthy and important merchants who own property in the State such as Mohomed Tyeb Khunji, Yusuf Ali Akbar, Shaikh Izhaq and others. Most of them are self made men who came to Bahrain with little or no money and acquired riches from successful trading. Twenty years ago all these people were Persian subjects and they had no wish to acquire Bahrain nationality but when the nationality law came into force in 1939 they were compelled to become Bahrain subjects to avoid losinglosing their properties. The Sunni Persians — they still are Persians to all extent and purpose — travel abroad to Persia and India, they speak Persian among themselves, their children attend the Government schools and they all belong to the Shafi sect, the Arabs and the Ruling Family are Malikis. Commercially and socially they are closely connected with the Holis and have little sympathy with their Shia countrymen. They never intermarry with the Arabs, who regard them and the Holis, as Persians. They have vested interests in the country and in Persia they are a minority so it is not likely that they would welcome Persian domination. But here again there are young men among them who are capable of wishing to see the Persians in Bahrain and some of the older men are anti-British and anti-Government. The sons of Mohomed Tyeb Khunji have for a long time been suspect#!! and one of the sons of an old Sunni Persian Shaikh, who died recently in Bahrain, edits a newspaper in Teheran and his brother is in Govern ment service there. Men of this type would willingly lend their help to the Persian cause. 6. The Holis are Sunni Persians, of the Shafi sect, who have been established in Bahrain for several genera tions. They and the Sunni Persians claim that their ances tors were Arabs who migrated from Arabia to Persia many centuries ago, some of them, later, recrossed the Gulf to Bahrain and to other Arab states such as ^attar and Oman. They call themselves Arabs but the Bahama and the Bahrain Arabs invariably refer to them as Holis. Few of them have been in Bahrain for more than two or three generations and in most cases, where the facts are known, the founders of the families were persons of small importance such as water carriers, charcoal burners and sweet makers. They are not really liked by the Arabs or by the Bahama and they do not intermarry with the Arabs. There have been a fewfew instances in recent years of Arabs accepting offers for their daughters from Holis but in most cases the marriages have been forbidden by the Ruler at the request of the other members of the Arab’s family or tribe. Like many people whose origin is dubious the Holis advertise themselves in every possible way as being true Arabs though many of the older men among them still refrain from wear ing the Arab Agal. They include the Kanoos, Fakhroos, Siadis, Yateems, Chirawis and Bin Mutters, Moayyads and many other well known families. A number of them live in MUharraq. Commercially they are the backbone of the community, they are energetic and prosperous and have more ability in trade both in the bazaars and in the pearl mar kets, than the Arabs or Bahama. Probably their mixed Persian and Arab background is an advantage to them. At the same time they are always conscious that- the Arabs regard them as Persians. The Khalifah shaikhs for example, will pay more attention to a ragged Bedouin from the desert than to Koli merchant. The Holis are better educated and richer than the Arabs, they own much property both in the towns and in the country, they are progressive and keenly political. At heart they are opposed to the Ruling Family. Because they have no tribal ties to bind them there is little cooperation between them and each family or group seek their own advantage at the expense of the rest. Young Holis are the leading lights in the clubs, a large propor tion of the clerks in CJovernment and commercial firms are Holis, though it is the policy of the Government when pos sible to employ Arabs or Bahama. The wealthy Holi merchants are certainly opposed to the Persian Government but they would like to have more control over the Government of Bahrain/though in affairs where they have been given a large measure of control they have proved to be completely lacking in public spirit and7- and concernod only in furthering their own interests. In this respect the Arabs and the Bahama have shown them selves to be more disinterested. The young Holis resent the attitude of the Khalifah and the Arabs who do not regard them as true Arabs, Many of them are leaders of the so called 'National Front' and these leaders have recently been trying to attract the Bahama to their party, but with small success. The young Holis profess to be patriotic and opposed to the Persians, they organised the appeal for funds for Palestine and the anti-partition de monstrations and they claim to be the supporters of the working classes, but some of them are sympathetic to the Persians. In the last two notices which were issued by the 'National Front' they threatened to appeal to Persia xf they did not get what they wanted. it is la:own too that whs* immediately^he left Bahrain Abdullah Zeera was in tough with Saad bin Shemlan, a notorious agitator, whose £on /^he head clerk of the Imperial Bank of Iran, is the secretary of the Muharraq Club and one of the leaders of the 'National Front'. Although most of the more responsi- ble and e£k*r Holis would certainly not welcome the Persians m Banrain yet there is cause to believe that for political reasons many of the young anti-government Holis, who direct tue affairs of the clubs^would give secret support to a pro-Persian movement, because by so doing they might advance their own cause in Bahrain. 8. Taking the different people who make up the popu lation in Bahrain and their reaction towards the Persian claim,^none of them regard the claim as justified. it would find no support from the Khalifah and the Arabs, unless from an individual who was personally antagonised towards his community. It would find no support among the village Bahama. A few of the town Bahama might be willing to * intrigue and politics are their metier. The Sunni PersiansPersians would not be sympathetic. A fairly large pro portion of the Shia Persians, would, I believe, v/elcome Persian rule. The leading Holis would be opposed to it but some of their young men might make overtures to Persia in order to make difficulties for the Government in Bahrain. •» C. J.
