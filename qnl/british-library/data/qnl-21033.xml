For a long time he kept clear of difficulties by being rery modest A retiring &amp; keeping aloof from entanglsroents.The opposition took heart at this A he then began to Aabble in local Politics 1 to get for himself a local following.This particularly in the perioA Just before I took OTer,&amp; it was Just beginning to get^too much St' for hia.

As to replacing him -He himself recommends a jram well educated young Indian of good family who is a first class Arabic scholar.He is now in India &amp; if you concur I thought of ^ i offering him the temporary Job of Interpreter with a Tiew to vetting him as a possibility for Indian Assistant. This brings me to the question of the remainder of the staff, Mirza Abdul Hussain^whom you well know,is anarrant s ®®Wdrel,H9 is most dish-nest &amp; there are many oases up against him now for which he might well be run in.In view of his past serYices howewer,I am not anxious to do this.He most certainly however should not be retained.He is quite incapable of running the remacular Office which I found in a deplorable state,4 I hays to attend to erery detail of it myself.

The figures given in your report on the working of the Bahrein AOL Order in Gounoil for 1922 which 42% subsequently hardly seera 4 to tear this out. The number of civil and criminal oases in 1922 numbered 854 and 123 respectively or a total of 977 (not 1250 as stated in your memorandum No# 4/0) and the figure^ for 1921 read| 777 and 231: a total of 1003 which is actually more than the total of 1922. Perhaps you mean to include miscellaneous petitions in your 1922 total. These are shown as numbering 244 in 1922 . and that would bring your 1922 total to 1221. Even that is not the same total as you reported (- namely 1250) in your memorandum. Besides for purpose^of comparison it would be . necessary to know how many miscellaneous petitions were dealt with in 1921. And this we do not know. Colonel Trevor would be much obliged if you could explain? Major O.K. Daly, I.A., Political Agent, B A H H S I N.7. sr The reason why I am asking you for this information is there may have been a mistake in the fixtures reported by you* And as Political Resident's representation to Government for the revival of the post of Indian Assistant rested largely on the increase in Court work, he would like to be able to support his argument - if called upon to do so - by telling figures. -7 7 /'■&gt;Th« Agency, 3ahraln 19/2/23. t u I JUOT' , . . /oar j).0, of 14, th. Whllo I w*8 writing my 4/0,1 sont to th« office for ths total narab«r of eases d alt with in order to quote the figure. The olerk was ^t the aoaent preparing figures fot the oreport on the Bahrain Order in Council.but when I signed that report I did not notice the apparent discrepancy. The figure I221 is correct f &amp; the Misceltaneous petitions nay rightly be included in it. They include all sorts of minor cases which are often settled by calling on a th ird party to aidiate etc. in the Arab style^ut all of which involve an expenditure of tiae.They were clisaifiod separately this last year instead of being included under Civil Suits as in 1921. The figure 1221 can therefore be coapared with the figure 1008 of 1921. In giving t e round figure 1250 the clerk allowed also for a nuaber of cases which were not in the registers &amp; therefore did not get included in the actual figures taken froa th ? registers forth® report. The reason for this is as follows.Shaik 1 s subjects filing suits against British subjects do not open the case by a petition in th^ ordinary v ay t but bring a letter from the Shaike or one of the Arair's. For soae time we treated these separately &amp; although the cases nwm* dealt with f they were not numbered &amp; entered in the registers as for other cases. When I discovered this I gave orders for such letters to be put in the petition box &amp; when dealt with to be numbered &amp; registered as for other cases. Allowing for these tho total would come to well over 125O .T0 get at the actual figure .as they are not registered, would entail going al' through the records,which hardly seems necessary.In future they will automatically be included in the figures quoted in the repor . When the fact that tho court was cloned for 5 months is allowed I think the increase is not inconsiderable.A large number of cas' which occur during the diving season were thereby escaped &amp; plai had to get what redress th^y could from the local 3hara f or drop their cases which many did.It was this inconvenien- 2# @ J 9 / which oaastfd many of th« leading people to ask ne to endeaVotlr to arrange,another time, for soneone to carry on the work of 1 he Court for nine* cases at least. The actual nuaber of cas s dealt with in 1922 was more than in I921 and wera dealt with in 9 month instead of 12 &gt; which meruit work at much higher pressure, Tha report for 1921 shows clearly the very great increase of Court work jver previous ye^rs # &lt;5c there was a still furthnr incr^ane in 1922.

Persien Gulf. yy/ / /c 4/4/24 Tour Demi -Off ical telegram No 497* It would be extremely difficult ^uat now to say definitely whether rn Assistant will be pezw nently required here or not.I should say that we must malco up our minds thct one will be required for at least two years-thereafter I think it should be possible to so arrange the work,by giving extra work to the Levy Officer,to make it possible to carry on without one or at any rate without a , British Officer, for by that time , sett lemej^nt of landed propoerty being finished &amp; a proper system for registering transfers of property having been introduced,court work of an intriC' te nature will be greatly reduced. At present numerous cases arise,often of a sowewh? t complicated naslittre-frequently involving foreigners-which it is impos ible to eitpect the 3haik to be able to settle without assistance &amp; advice by the Political gent.We are clearing off a large number of these,but the work is handicapped for the want of a proper survey,a8 soon as that is done we could get property properly settled in the course of a few months, ^t wojrld be tedious here to go into details f but there is indescribable chaos as regards the record of rights in property. In numerous cases Shaik ias^ had sold property vhich did not belAng to him, sometimes twice over. Previously nobody could afford to complain,now they have no hesitat ion. Cases of over ten years standing ve do not go into,as there would be no limit &amp; it has been agreed that ten years possession constiti.tes a definite right to the property,but there are m^ny recent cases.Gradually we are settling them &amp; often there is no fair way out except for thn Government to compensate one of the parties.3haik Hand is placing up well £ anxious to get all these matters settled. It would not be possible to hand over such matters for settlement in a lower court &amp; they take up a ]ot of time.What1*° is roquiraa is a :1 econa court which would relieve .ihaik Hamaa &amp;SsyBelf of the countless petty oases which occur. The Assistant wouia ;;it on thi court with a young aeraher of the family whom we are training now, in the same way thnt Ifcm- a i I sit on the higher court.The arab member v ouia tPke cases between Bahrain subjects ( the Asst.P.A. being st liable to advise him when ho asks for rtn opinion) the A.^pA. would take cases between British subjects &amp; protectea persons A they wouia tigether tnie cases where both classes are involvea. There wouia be wn tppeul by Hamra's subjects to him in the Higher Court.by British nubjects to the Political Agent 4 Byom Joint court caaoa ih the l ower nourt to the Higher Joint Court, The lower court wouia h ve powers of second class Mrgistmtes.Lana oases * oases of ■ serai-Political wt ire be tween aunnia &amp; shiaha which wnnt oarefgl handling wouia be reserve 1 fo: f the higher courts .Experience for t e merabnra of the lover court is not therefora of Titnl importance,as appeal ia possible % the or se a will '11 be vary simple. I personally should liko to se* the reforms put thanmgh as for as possible before I leave.I have no difficulty in working with Haasd Jb he is genuinely j nxious to get things straight.At the same time I have had no leave since 1914 &amp; I T CMn on for ever. If Government would apooint rn /ssistant at once,so that he would hrva picked up the work by next cold weather,,* the survey is atarted off as soon us possible,it should be possible to get all the principle reforms over next cold weather.I should then ^k to be allowed to go on long leave next spring. I have not been keeping very good hetlth lately &amp; f el that I shall very likely badly ne-^d recess this hot we- 4 tber.dtt wil. be my fourth hot wetfcHarrhere £ I have only been able to take reces once .This following on several years without leave in Iraq is be ginning to toll on me. At the same tim I f^el that I would like to see the thing through &amp; see Hamad well started off with 4 clean slate. If the \ ere a pointed now it might be pos ible for me to take recess about August &amp; September when everybody i diving &amp; work is normally slack. I would suggest that Government be asked to appoint a young asoirant for n olitical f whose w mewould be coming up for appointment aa a probfitioner sty f bout a yepr hence. I could tr.uin him in tho work required during the next few months &amp; he would relieve me of « lot of routine work.Sncodlng ^ decoding wires slone t- kes up c lot of time .Normally thrt v ^ould not mfitter.but with all the reform work on hand the routine work is really now more than I can cope with, ouch an officer would gain a lot of useful exp rience 4 learn Arabic. He could be well 'vetted 1 as to his suitability for subsequent appointment as a probationer &amp; when the time coaos to appoint him, say next year.he would then go off for his training His experience &amp; loc^l knowledge together with n knowledge of rabic he will h^ve acquired might well fit hia for ?.A. here 1 iter on f when his local knowledge acquired during the introduction of th 1 reforms would be ^n c -sset. There must be sever? 1 such young Military Officers on the list of the P &amp; P. from whom • likely ir n could be selected &amp; doubtle he would Jura &gt; - t the chance of gaining exp rience i the opportunity of shev ing wh' t he wrs worth as he would be sura to be subsequently appointed to the Department if he had done well. To be u seful he should be appoint d ver^ soon ,30 that by next cold werther he will have found his feet &amp; leJ've rae to get on with the more i portant work. Among other things I was going to suggest,^ which if approved I vant to get on with during th hot weather, is the preparation f in ar^bic of a simple Criminal Procedure Code &amp; Civil Code f for use in the Low^r &amp; Higher courts. Hemad feels the need of this badly.I would suggest that it be based on the Indian codes would in fact merely be t transl tion of the most important articles into arabic mad e as sitap^e ? s possible . It might be necessary to add , 4 ust a few articles in refemnce to particular local matters which do not come under Indian Law but are based on long est'-blished custom.It would not,of course be introduced until approved, it present cases are decided by Hamad by the light of mture only,or in dif iGu ?-t cases he generally consult s rae &amp; asks whet the law is as it would b applied in the Agency Court. It seems e:3senti«l f bo th for him &amp; for his subjects that it should be laid down in Arabic what, for instance are the limits of punishment for specified offences.Particular^y the, dunaecl to know the procedure in debt c»ges ^ the law regarding mortgages. There ,is probably no place where 30 much borrowing 4 mortgaging goes on as in Bahrain - the whole diving system is one of borrowing from begi nin^ to end &amp; giyes rise to much litigation. It would be necessary to ensure that articles in the code soiatranslated do not conflict with the ohara &amp; in some caaos with local customJB. The task is not an extraordinary difficult one,but it will take a do^l of time % I cannot man ge it without being relieved of 2 ?oae routine work. It is particularly necessarj that such small codes should b^ as simple as possible.There ?re no trained Judges &amp; it would be useloss to give them s full &amp; intricate code- th t must come gradually as the local Covernranet gs in experience, but my experience here m-ikws me convinco ' that a sti rt is necessary, ilv rybody admits thr t civil courts are essentiel.T^e 3hara T could not et through the work.already th 1 Qudhis are kept htrd at it with Inheritance 0 ses-m* rriago disputes c the like which of course will always continue to be dealt with by the 3hara* I haw written at great lenght I tm afraid lb in haste,but perhaps if the circumstances could be pieced before Governimiftt, t y would agree to appoint an Assist' nt of the type suggested as e^rly as possible,!; it might be convenient for them,for future . rrangements to know that if approved,! should like to get on with the reforms,the import'nt part of which ^3till remain to be done-during naxt cold weather I- to tf-ke long leave th^rosfter.1 iaantion this ps Colonel Knox emce wrote to GovornmRHt,I think? that I might be considered to be available for Bahrain up till 192) if Govemanet so desired.I feel however that my health will scarcely permit of my going on so long without a rest.The last ye^r hero,although th work has bean interesting,ha3 not been without a good deal of trouble consequent on the agitation over the introduction of the new regime,A g^od deal of anxiety.

Poet of Assistant Political Agent would 'be . required for some years but if it would eatpediie matters, perhaps appointment could be firs made on emporary basis. 1 regard it as of greatest importance that probationer should leave since 1914 and is over worked; if an officer could be appointed now and learnt work it would enable Daly later on in summer to take recess which he probably will badly need as he is not in good health. Further, presence of Assistant and consequent relief from petty case work ih his own and in joint Court would enable Daly to go ahead faster wilh importr -ant reforms and get them firmly established before he has to ro on leave next spring. Having been out ten years he cannot wait longer. Assistant -olitical Agen could then, if suitable, carry on. be appointed as soon as possible. j-'aly has not haa long Trevor.

Captain D.R, Smith of the Polltleal Department, who was selected for the appointment In May 1924 arrive-; In Bahrein on Uth June 1924, hut was transferred as Vlee-Consul Dusdap in Ostohar of ths same year after a stay of only four months in Bahrein* The object for whioh the appointment was sanctioned mmm in May 1924 was two fold:- Firstly, to reliere the Politieal Agent of some of ■»of the minor Court work, which is rery hoary and inoreaiing &lt; to ^ daily owing Refor*® in tho Judicial and other branches of the State Administration, a^nd to permit him to derote more of his time to the superrision and proper progress of these reforms in eaeh department of the State* For this purpcee the officer selected was instructed to act as Assistant to the Political Agent in general and in particular in sitting as a Small Cause Joint Court with the new Amir of Uanameh* The second oHJect of the appointment was to pro Tide an officer ouinpetent to superrisc the conduct of a Rcrenue Surrey of these islands, which was contemplated during the winter of last year* X teg learc to submit that it has not teen possible to attain cither of these ohjects during the short sojourn of an Assistant Political Agent in Bahrein in the autumn of last year, and that their attainment is of no less, tut of even greater importance now than it was a year ago* The foundation of the RcforniB has teen firmly laid, tut a stage has now reached when progress towards the completion of a lasting structure which will form the tasis of future peace and prosperity in Bahrein is teyond the scope of the Political Agent alone, trammelled as he is ty a mass of Court work and other responsitilities connected with his position as sole representatire of all foreign sutjects in Bahrein* During the short period I hare teen here, 1 hare found it extremely difficult, if not impossitle, to gire due attention to the multifariou 3 duties which fall to the lot of the Political Agent* TheTh« tcnm of Manaa«h la frowln« rapidly; the •eaaatlon of oppression by the ruling family and the wide- • spread oonfidenee and security produeed by the establish- •ment of a proper Court of law under the presidency of the Sheikh is daily attracting store foreigners to these islands to engage in the pearl trade and to carry on business with the mainland. It can hardly be hoped that the Political Agent will be reliered of the increasing responsibilities entail- -ed by the now rapid adrance of cirilisation in Bahrein* until the reforms introduced by His Majesty* s OoTemment have reached a level commensurate with the effect which their introduction has produced 9 and with the expectations of the Sheikh and his Subjects* Without overstepping either of these limits, there is still much to be done* The most pressing need a t the moment however is an accurate survey of the island and the compilation of a record of rights, without which it is extremely difficult to settle many intricate disputes regarding ownership of land which the Bahrein Court has had to deal with* Though it was hoped that this survey would be carried out last winter v it was not possible to make the necessary arrangements in time* Jot the coming winter however arrangements are well in train 9 and it is Jtajor Daly* s particular desire to commence the work immediately on his 0 return from leave and to supervise it personally. Z have attempted to show that it will not be possible for him to do so effieiently t unless he is provided with an Assistant to relieve him of some of his routine work* In the meanwhile, with an imperfect knowledgeof the language and a Tery short experience of looal eonditionp, I an finding it no light task to compete with the work 8igle«&gt;hande#« The pearling season brings with it \ a large influx of foreigners and a consequent inorease of wo wor^kt a time when the climate of Bahrein is at its worst* A 'break- down in my health ( *hich I do not howeyer anti- -oipate ) would cause serious inconTenience to a large number of people* In my opinion the appointment of an Assistant Politieal Agent is a natter of pressing importance rt the moment, but it is difficult to sxaggerats the urgent need of this appointment no later than September cr October next, when Major Daly will be returning and the Surrey parties are sxpested from India* Zt is perhaps hardly necessary for me to refer to the long correspondence which has taken place on this subject in the past # and of which both the Residency and the GoTemment of India are fully aware* I beg leare therefore only to draw your attention to a despatch Ho* 229-6 dated the 6th April 1924 and a telegram Ho* 629 dated the 9th April 1924 both addresssd by Colonel Tre-ror to the Foreign and Political Department immediately prior to his final departure from the Persian Gulf* Z wenture to say that this eorrespondenee bears eyidence of his conyiotion, of long experience of Bahrein* of the utmost importance of the early appointment of an Assistant Politieal Agent 9 a post which he went so far as to say would be required for some years* I request therefore that you may be pleased to recommend to the Goyemment of India an extension of the appointment of Assistant Political Agent for a period J I ofThe Hon'ble tlie Polltica Resident ir.

I[0$ ft V, On recess. care iostmaster Aarachl. 7th September I92J. y dear Huasell I am ..rlting to you regarding the matter of a steno grapher which I broached to j,ou on the ship, I would have written from rinagar but we were cut oif whn the last mail left /Car chi. d* I have been simply appalled by the amount of donicey work in Bahrein and the slender staff that exists to tope with it. In any Political Agency in Indiadealing with the same amount of work ti ere ..ould certainly be an A.F.A. Just as there is a vice consul at Ahwaz, in addtion to the Indian Assistant. 3. I have considered various ra»ans of alleviating ny lot d giving myself time to do some Political workt read text books, keep my knowledge of British Indian law up to date, and incidentally attend to igy own affairs. 4. The first solution is to apply for an A.P.A. This will i be inxevitable if and when an oil company opens operations on a large scale In Bahrein, but I aw afraid it would take too long to put through to be of any help to me for the next year or two. The Indian assistant ts yoj r : iow , is entirely occupied with Judicial work, ( we have 2000 citiI and criminal cas es a year ) and does no tip political work.at all. 5. The second is to discharge Kaunakaran, the present passport clerk, and to substitute a cadre post for him, and post a clerk knowing rabic to it. it is not possible to employ him exclusively for passport worx as it has to be divided up, and he is actually registrar of the vernacular office, and our Court records. As he knows no Arabic great confusion ensues and work is duplicated, but unfrotanately he has a contract for another two years, and although I could no doubt give him notice I do not like to discharge him at once, though circumstances may demand it next year. h 6. The tird 18 for y ou t0 t0 transfer Abdul Latif else where in November, axid allow me to engage a really capable clerk knowing shorthand to take his place as a permanent hand. I au used to dictating and with this help I can knock off drafts an( judgments far quicker and * have time for more important work. I wo Id advertise for him at once, a and after satisfying myself of his shorthand speed, aske the CHectorhere to let him wor^ in the T easury for two months so that he may learn something about Treasury and accounts. Should t^e Collector object I will asic the Commissioner of AJmer to tajce him. I would do all this without any cost to Government and he would not be paid by you until he was posted to Bahrein, in say, Noyembe r. 7. By this means I should get badly needed help, and the Gulf Cadr a really useful clerkinstead of the out-of-wor]^ hired from the near est bazaar that we have too often had in the past. 8. If you approve please wire me permission to adver ise for him. You incur no liablity till Nov 1st, and soon after that date I hope you will be able to post Abdul Latif elsewhere, so tha-t I can maice use of this man and have him posted to me. I have no Komplaint against Abdul Latif except that he has married the daughter of Kanoo's coolc and that he is therefore quire unreliable as regards local affairs- a fact which throws much additional work on Gazdar ( the only other English nice clerk ) who is already badly overworked. Bis dat qui c^to dat Yours sincerely.D.O. No. 2133 of 1929. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bush ire, 17 th September 1989. p. f Please refer to your demi-official letter dated the 7th September last in which you refer to the possibility of an Assistant Political Agent being appointed to Bahrain and make certain suggestions regarding your clerical establishment. Colonel Barrett does not consider the question of the appointment of an Assistant to the Political Agent to be pressing. m any case he would be unwilling to refer the matter to Government before something definite is known about the future of the Bushire Hesidency, as there is a possibility of the latter being moved to Bahrain in which case other factors and conditions would have to be considered. The same applies to yuur second suggestion regarding the abolition of the temporary post of Passport Clerk and the substitution of a cadre appoint ment with an arabic knowing clerk to fill it. As regards the engagement of a permanent stenographer with training in treasury work in place ofI2 of Abdul Latif. I'm afraid i can be no more helpful. We have candidates on our list working as temporary clerks, some of whom have 'been waiting for four years for an appointment, and Colonel Barrett regrets that in the circumstances the entertainment of a new man over their heads cannot be approved. If you still wish Abdul Latif to be transferred this can be arranged.&lt;// C 0*TF IPE N TTIA L« No. 125 C.
