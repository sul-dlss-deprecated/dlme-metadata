The nature of the duties and responsibilities which at present attach to this post are known to you, and it is our' intention that the Officer should take full charge of them. All important matters - for instance those which concern our policy and the Treaty - would receive our personal &amp; t tent ion as before, though we may require the British Officer to assist and advise in apy matters which we saw fit to refer to him. Secondly, while it is our desire that the officer whose services we wish to acquire, be designated our Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that he should occupy himself princi pally with the affairs of that post we should wish to entrust to him certain additional responsibilities of which the more important are a^ follows: (a) We may require him to act as our Financial Adviser. (b) Ho would take over the Minicipal administration of Muscat and Mutrak. (c) We should desire him to hold a watching brief over the officials of our Government and to 3 ettle any matters which arise between them in our absence from Muscat. He would make tours of our territories (Ras-al- Hadd to Malhah) for this purpose and for the purpose of enabling him to make proposals to us for improve ments in the administration. (d) toe should require him to examine -one various fields for development and the possibilities for obtaining progressive improvement in the welfare of our people, and to advise us on these matters.e~31X/7j/91. ^f’lOK, 3.R.1 31 as .ux-on, ip 5o j^O 3-10 With the tar*anaf ir of flepartjaantaal rc&amp;pozu»ibillfor the ir eroiun Gulf stiLteo iTua the Coa .on*veaitu Kulatioaa uffloe to the Foreign Gffioe as rrom .\priX 1st, UU» aaor tarlat has now taken over the duties connected with rcorultino Britlah oxpcsrta MO adviaura for those ut&amp;tec# 1 am therufore writing in reply *9V3 to your tolegruma noi^ zifi to fiamaon at th* Oo—unMi inlth Helationa of rice about the post of Advisor to the sultan of Muscat# to have, X fe^, ao for drav/n a blank# Colonel liorthfiold naa been pronounced cdlciilly unfit by his doctor for service in a climate such os that of muscat# hurphy lias accepted a poet und sr the Gov ;i*nmant of i akistan* i^unvood of the Sudan, whose particulars X attach herewith, is not considered suitable by the Sudan oovenuaent London ufflce# He liae, as you will sec, been stationed in j^uatoria province for the last 9 years, aid it la considered that m a result he is probably by now somewhat out of touch with the Arab mentality and langmigc# He is, nereovs^, apparently of a sasaewhut ma^terilLi pcrscnslXty, and after several years as a Governor mi^ht find it difficult to Adapt himself to the rolo of /.dviser# The Colonial off !00 have already been approached# They now inform us that they hare gone tm*r the field very carefully, including, that of officer^ serving in &gt;ale^tine, but that there is no Colonial service cfflcer witii thu requisite quailfi ou ti one who Cun be spared. ,e wil^, howevur, if neoessary press thorn again on the question of sccondciont# Meamrhlls, however, we are following up your suggestion regarding the CudiJn GwVonnuc^it &lt;&gt;crvieu.

During an interview I had with the Sultan on March 10th, I asked him whether he would be agreeable to accept a candidate without a knowledge of Arabic, and explained that we were exper- iencing some difiiculty in finding a suitable person who already knew the language. He replied insisting that a knowledge of Arabic was absolutely essential. I then told him that the Commonwealth Relations Office was trying to get in touch with Colonel Northfield and said we would let him know the result in due course. The Sultan urged the necessity of getting somebody soon, and said that he was most unhappy about the present position where he had nobody he could rely on to control the administration ana see that his orders were carried out, or even suggest to him improvements in the administration. At the moment, he said, all ideas had to come from him personally and even then he could no t i ely on his oilicials to put them into execution efficiently. He did not mention anything about Major Fforde gnd I did not stress the matter at this meeting. . ^ ailin g Northfield I do hope the Commonwealth Relations Of rice will be able to-find another candidate soon, otherwise I fear the Sultan may produce his own candidate.

In view of our iaminent assumption of responsibility I should pbrhaps let you know at once that we at the Foreign Office agree warmly with the views expressed in paragraph if of Gibson’s letter of the 3rd March, that His Majesty’s Government with their special position in the Persian Gulf cannot remain indifferent to the standard of administration in the Sheikhdoms, for the shortcomings of whose governments His Majesty* s Government, whatever the legal position may be, will be held responsible. It is therefore somewhat disquieting to find that the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein, which are relatively the two more important of the Sheikhdoms, do not seem to have realised that the increasing strategic and economic importance of their States demands an improvement in their present standard of adninistration, and the delegation to competent Advisers of sufficient executive authority to carry out a programme of administrative and social reform and economic development if they are to avoid political agitation and economic unrest in the future. Before taking the matter any further we should, however, like to have a comprehensive appreciation from you on the question of British advisers at Koweit and Bahrein and also at Muscat. We should like to know Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., /what Bahreinwhat advisers you would think it desirable to have in these three states - e.g* financial adviser in Koweit, assistant and possible successor to Belgrave in Bahrein, adviser on Foreign Affairs in Muscat, possible British police officers in Koweit and Bahrein, and any others you would wish to suggest - and also your views on the chances of securing the agreement of the various rulers to such appointments. I am copying this letter to Troutbeck at the British Middle Bast Offices, and would be grateful for any conments he may care to make. • V . V Yours ever. (Sgd.) B • A. «B .Burrows.I am very sorry that I have not beon able to rv-ply before to your letter of February 16th about the post of Adviser to the oultaa of Muscat. I have consulted the Comnonwealth Kelations office who agree that it is lively that the oultan would wish to see you personally before entering into any firm coaalt&amp;ant to you. v e think therefore that the best pl^n would be to put your suga^ction to bir l upert Hay, political Pesident in the * orsian Uulf, and ask him to talk the matter over wi th the uitan if he agrees* Before we write to oir Rupert, however, I should be most gratol'ul it' you could confirm that, should the aultan invite you to visit him for an interview at his expense, and should he offer you the post as a result of this interview, you would be definitely prepared to accept it. You will appreciate that the jult&amp;n might well feel aggri ved if after paying your pasat to Muscat arid offering you the post you were thon to refuse it — particularly since another candidate has unfortunately already treated him in this way. In view of the very trying cliniate of Muscat, we should also be grateful far you confirmation before we write to Sir Rupert Hay, that your doctor oonsidurs you fit for service in thvi j ersiun Gulf.

I am sorry that we have been so long in replying but we have gone over the field very carefully and I much regret to confess that there is at present no Colonial Service officer with the requisite qualifications who could be made available for this post. Our real Arab experts are very few, and even among the officers serving in Palestine we have drawn blank. I should, however, like to draw your attention to W.H.Ingrams about whom Sir Charles Jeffries here wrote to Mr. Donaldson of the India Office in 1946 when the India Office v/ere looking for a British Adviser to the Sultan. I enclose a copy of that letter. Ingrams is now serving as Chief Commissioner of the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast but his health has not been good there. He will probably come home in the eaply summer and we may have to retire him on health grounds. In that event he might like to be considered for the Muscat post. . W ' m yv*— ( I * 1^.1. ' T. B. K.

After war service from 1914-1919 he was appointed Administrative Officer in Zanzibar and ser.ved there until 1927 when he went to Mauritius as Assistant Colonial Secretary. In 1934 he was promoted Political Officer, Aden, .and in .1937 Resident Adviser to the Kathirl^ Sultan and Resident Adviser to the Sultan of Mukal^a. He served in this post with a short interval during which he was Chief Secretary, Aden, until last year when he was seconded to the Control Commission for Germany. His year with the Control Commission expires in July and he is anxious to return to overseas service. He feels as we dp that he has been long enough in his present appointment but we have not at the moment any vacancy in which we could make suitable use of his rather special qualifications. He has published numerous books and papers, the most important of which are 'Zanzibar. Its History and Its People ' 1 (1930), 'Report on Social, Economic and Political Conditions of the Hadfanamaut' (1937) and 'Arabia and the Isles' (1942). He has had considerable experience of negotiating treaties and agreements with Sultans and Chiefs in the Aden Protectorate and with the Yemeni Government.

Therefore we find it very difficult to accept the services of an officer who makes such reservation or holds such views. Me should like to point out that quite a number of British officers had served our government in the past but none of them had made such reservation and we find it quite a peculiar matter in the case of Mr. Thesiger. Again we must say quite frankly that we arc not in favour of permitting any British officer actually in our service to visit the interior at the present time for various reasons or to let him make unnecessary tours along the coast except when his duties call on him to do so and this will be regulated. The greater part of the officers time is to bo spent in the capital (Muscat) as he has to look after certain departments although his main work will be as our Foreign Minister. Me shall be grateful if you will refer to Article 2 of the Treaty regarding the movement of foreigners in our terri tories. This Article will show quite clearly our views in this connection. if Mr. Thesiger will agree to come without any such reservation and that he inderstands the situation then it is well and good, otherwise we have expressed our views on the subject and we arc sure you will agree with us and as you have already indicated in your telegram that you realise Mr. Thesiger*s reservation may make it difficult for us and we must say it is so. / In2 *' - i To 2 U «&gt; / (W In case Mr. Thesiger finds it dii'ficult to agree and accept the post on the above understanding, we shall be very grateful if the trouble will bo taken to find us an officer suitable for the post and who will adopt himself with our views and do not make such reservations which l am unable to accept* it has occurred to us that ^lr* G*N* Jackson who was Assistant Consul during 1942-19^3 in Dhofar may suit the post if his services can be secured and if he is willing to come to us# ,*e shall be grateful if his services can be made available.

I do not know him but Galloway thinks that he should fill the post well. 3. Stewart has suggested that we should consider emplgying Dowson, a copy of whose record I enclose. He is rather old for the job but Stewart thinks it unlikely that he would in any way embarrass even a very junior Political Agent. He is primarily a date expert and I have recently received a letter from Crawford suggesting that we might be interested ii; obtaining his services to advise on local date growing. His knowledge of date cultivation would be very useful in Muscat in view of the extensive date gardens on the Batinah Coast and the fact that the date is Muscat's principle export.

After Compliments, Thank you for your letter dated the 9th March, 1945, in regard to the appointment of a British Officer to the service of our Government. Since we first mentioned the matter to you in the general terms stated in your letter, we have given the question our further consideration and hope that what follows will make our wishes clear and pro vide you with the information you require. our wish to acquire the services of a British Officer to be appointed as our Minister for Foreign Affairs. The nature of the duties and responsi bilities which at present attach to this post are known to you, and it is our intention that the Officer should take full charge of them. All important matters - for instance those which concern our policy and the Treaty - would receive our personal attention as before, though we may require the British Officer to assist and advise in any matters which we saw fit to refer to him. Secondly, while it is our desire that the officer whose services we wish to acquire, be designated our Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that he should occupy himself principally with the affairs of that post we should wish to entrust to him certain additional respon sibilities of which the more important are as follows : (a) We may require him to act as our Financial Adviser. (b) He would take over the Municipal administration of Muscat and Mutrah. (c) We should desire him to hold a watching brief over the officials of our Government and to settle any matters which arise between them in our absence from Muscat. He would make tours of our terri tories (Ras-al-Hadd to Malahah) for this purpose and for the purpose of enabling him to make pro posals to us for improvements in the administrations. (d) We should require him to examine the various fields for development and the possibilities for obtaining progressive improvement in the welfare of our people, and to advise us on these matters. We shall be glad to be informed whether a suitable officer can be found for the purposes we have mentioned and to be given an indication of the terms that would be acceptable to him. We have no objection to the loan of an officer from the service of your Government but would like to know whether he has worked in Arab countries and if he can speak Arabic. Yours sincerely, Sd.

The Sultan insists that Thesiger should begin his expedition from the Muscat end and I have informed the Middle East Office at Cairo accordingly. This is convenient as the Sultan is not now leaving for Dhofar until December. It is being arranged that Thesiger should come to Muscat before he starts on his travels and this will give both the Sultan and the Political Agent a chance of interviewing him. 3. The Sultan is not at all happy at the idea of having to wait a year before Thesigers services can be made available. He proposes to remain at Dhofar at any rate until the auturm of 1947 and is anxious to have some body on whom he can rely in charge at Muscat. If he approves of Thesiger possibly you may be able to persuade the Colonial Office to release him as soon as possible after the completion of his forthcoming expedition.

As regards Mr.Ingrams, although he is a distinguished Arabist I gather that as an administrator he is a square peg in a round hole and probably would not fit into the Job (this is the advice of the Foreign Office and I have heard the opinion from other sources). It seems to me that the most likely field would be some officer of the I.P. S. who does not see many further prospects in that Service (e*g* Major Hickinbotham, present P.A.

While I deeply appreciate the offer of the appointment as British Adviser to the Sultan of Muscat, I do not feel I want to go to the Hast to take up any permanent employment, for the present anyhow. I am just settling down at Home after 31 years, with the last seven years continuous service in the Middle East and require a long spell at Home before I could think of serving in that area again. In any case I do not contemplate serving abroad for any considerable period again, but should my services be required on any short term commission after the lapse of a reasonable period in England, I should be prepared to consider such service. I must, therefore, ask indulgence to be excused from accepting this kind offer, of the honour of which I am very sensible. I am. Yours sincerely. E.P.

Ingrams, C.M.G-., O.B.E., about whom I spoke to you. Ingrams was born in 1897 and educated at Shrewsbury where he had a Classical Scholarship. After war service from 1914 - 1919 he was appointed Administrative Officer in Zanzibar and served there until 1927 when he went to Mauritius as Assistant Colonial Secretary. In 1934 he was promoted Political Officer, Aden, and in 1937 Resident Adviser to the Kathiri Sultan and Resident Adviser to the Sultan of Mukalla. He served in this post with a short interval during which he was Chief Secretary, Aden, until last year when he was seconded to the Control Commission for Germany. His year with the Control Commission expires in July and he is anxious to return to overseas service. He feels as we do that he has been long enough in his present appointment but we have not at the moment any vacancy in which we could make suitable use of his rather special qualifications. He has published numerous books and papers, the most important of which are 'Zanzibar. Its History and Its People' (1930), 'Report on Social, Economic and Political Conditions of the Hadhramaut' (1937) and 'Arabia and the Isles' (1942). He has had considerable experience of negotiating treaties and agreements with Sultans and Chiefs in the Aden Protectorate and with the Yemeni Government. In the Hadhramaut he started every Government activity and built up a complete Government organisation from practically nothing, as well as placing the States on a sound financial basis and establishing education, health and police services. I snould add that in all this work he has been most ably helped by Mrs. Ingrams who has herself done E. P. Donaldson, Esq, excellentwork amongst the Arab women. If you wish to get in touch with him we should have no objection at all to your approaching him direct. His present address is - Control Commission for Q-ermanyr' A*—and I;. O'.

He thinks that he will be in need of advice in future on such subjects as Civil Air developments as well as on matters of foreign relations and, in addition, he needs someone to supervise his Government officials and tighten up administration generally. We are naturally very anxious to do what we can to assist the Sultan to obtain a suitable British 4dviser.

At the same time, the Political Agent, Muscat, has telegraphed that the Sultan (i) Foreign Office ve *y disappointed that we have not been able ( Captain Holt i to find him someone and, hopes that we A succeed by the winter. He is showing considerable anxiety, and stresses that he is handicapped t) nt of India re.whom he can trust. It has been suggested to us that you might possibly know of a suitable officer for this appointment. You will see from the enclosed copy of an express letter from the Political Resident dated the 5th April the kind of functions which he would be expected should be a man with some administrative experience.

My confidents ascribed in the following paragraphs* 4. It is clear from verbal and written re quests Saltan feels need of both an Adviser akt an Administrative Official and that ho proposes t* com bine the functions in one person. Sultan seems to think that there will be civil air development in his dtate and if he feels the need of advice on this it is obviously desirable that it should come from accepted British official. He is on stronger ground as regards development and general progress and it is gratifying that he turns to us for assistance. On this above it is desirable, I think, to find him an official to avoid his seeking elsewhere. 6. As regards 2 (a) past officers have been styled Financial Adviser and/or Wasir and present suggestion raises doubt ?(nut) . for I do not think Sultan really intends to make a British official a Foreign fciniater. The point can be considered later. (b) and(d). The present situation is bal^d and needs rectifying which cannot be done by any present Btate employee. (d) Gultan needs a loyal and energetic official to visit his scattered Wa3Js who, but for visits at very long intervals, are practically inde pendent of Btate control.

Using this figure as a basis the following rought estimate demonstrates the practicability of the proposal from a financial point of views- (a) British Officer's pay, leavej pension contribution it c. •. • • •. •. Rs. 20,000/- Rs. 5,000/- Rs. 5,000/- Rs. 10,000/- Rs. 10,000/- Rs. 6,000/- Rs. 15,000/- Rs. 30,000/- (b) Accommodation (c) Office staff etc (d) Education (e) iAedical (f) Sanitation (g) Muscat Officials, Customs etc (h) Miscellaneous developments etc town 3. Gwadur is a small(bwn)of some 12,000 inhabitants &lt;f whom about half are British Aghakhani subjects. There are also at least two villages. There is no form of sanitary service though there is a municipal committee which owing to local friction is inoperative. There is one small Arab school and the Aghakhanis have some schooling Arrange ments. There are no police, and, so far as I know, no local court. Borne dozen or so Askars keep the peace. There are no medical facilities. Most of the revenue is derived from the customs and the fishing industry. The latter is capable, I think, of considerable development. It is not improbable that the area may again come into importance as a landing ground for aircraft both sea and land. Reasonable administration would benefit India directly in trade matters. 4. It will, therefore, be seen that there is work for a British Officer in administering the territory and organ ising ordinary civil and municipal services, but the necessity for providing one at the present time of short age of officers is not so apparent. There is, of course, no urgency from the point of view of the Gwidur public, but air development may demand the presence of a reliable official. The duration of the appointment, if made, is difficult to estimate, and I think that it might be on a yearly basis. 5. Even if the urgency is not apparent from an admini - trative point of view, the Bultan has asked us for assist ance in a project of development and improved administration and we should,I think, provide the assistance with as little delay as possible. If we do not he may turn else where which would be most undesirable. I hope, therefore that you will be able to make arrangements for the loan of a suitable officer to the I4uscat State for administering Gwadur in the fairly near future. If the Government of India are unable to depute an officer, you might perhaps consider employing an officer from the Training Centre in Arabic Studies, Jerusalem. Sd/- A.C. Galloway.
