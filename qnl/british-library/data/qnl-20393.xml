I have the honour to subnit herewith fuller details regarding al-Duwish^s visit to Haffar. 2. According to His Excellency shaiidi Ahmad who ootained his news from a special man whom he toad sent Tor the purpose, al-Duwish arrived at Haffar on 22nd August and on the same day tile Braiti shaildas Ibu Ashwau aad Ibia Munaiiiit arrived baoJt i'ron ' a vlBit to Bin gaud at'Riatk. The latter' b news from tJaere was tlaat Bia Samd had collected a large force'of ^btan Dawasir and Southern tribes with the idea of moving them into Hassa, but news of a big Ataiba raid against thei^ahtan left at home, caused him to send back the Dawasir and ^aitan to deal with the | situation. 3. Bin Saud had also, according to them, ordered ibn Mfeaad to remain at Ajibba only if he felt safe, otherwiBe he should retire on Hail. 4. a?o them, the Braih Shaikhs, Ibn Saud had given orders that they should retire from the exposed position ol Hal - ar al Batin, and move south ^Artawiyeh. Bin Saud had extracted 'an oath on the Koranthat they would not flay him lalse. 5 on hearing this last report al-Duwish toad ufbraided thac, the Braih generally, for being fools. 'Eleven times has Bin Saud broken his promises to you, do you not consider it time you broke your one and on^y oath to him. You are Braih and Mutairis first, afterwards NeJdiB* Now is your^ time to f '-2- ) J li 1 ( act, eitheac Join me, al-^wiBii, or toe ny eaeny for life, okooBe one of the other ooiiirBes today, yo* will not be allowed to Bit on the fence any longer 11 ..

According to the Shaikh 8 B messenger, the negociations nearly ended in a fracas, when Azaiyiz ibn paisal al-mwish, fearing lest the Braih were aboiit to refuse his father's oi^er, STiddenly broke in and shoiited 14 Wtoe not my father present, by Ood, I would lof your heads off with my own hand, You Cowards l' however, roundly rebuked his son and maae inn^eaia ^ely ask pardon. He subsequently also forced him to go to the in sulted chieftains' tents and appease their anger by gifts .and Oologies. rj the end of the proceedings al -DUwish having extracted the necessary asrurances of alliance, returned to Safa in the rpawal janubi. There he said he would await the arrival oi Ibn Ashwan and Ibn Munaihim 8 His son Azaiyiz he sent off with 1000 men in the directi®| of Hail not improbably the objective oeing Ajiboa ana Ibn M ^saad. 9, According to Shaikh Ahmad, not only many oi tiae Bin gaiad^s ghammatf who were camped in the Neutral Zone, out also most'of the suwait group of Dhafir, have moved into •Iraq, example Hautush al-SUwait who is now at Chabda* a?his last may or may not be corx^ect news.

Sir, ftt coti ca. . I have the honour,in continuation of my teiegram ;io .488 l ^ dated the 22nd August 1929,to give some details of my oon versation with Shaikh Earhan ibn Mashur which may be round of interest. 2. I shall not dwell on the main request of Ibn Masnur to visit Baghdad and see His sxcellency the High commissioner. This has already bet&gt;n dealt witu 'bele^ram. ^ 3. Ibn Mashur camped at ffort Mishrif, or ^asr surra as it is also lenown, some 8 miles south of Kuwait. He had come in,- I I I he said, via Sbaiba. the last village of the ^usur group. 4 . He was accompanied by 15 armed men who all wore the large white turban over red kaffiyahB. Ibn Mashur himself carried a sword. 5. T he conversation was held in the presence of Shai^ii Abdullah al-jabir, the Shaikh of Kuwait's right hand mn and Qommander of T 1 * 0 * 6. The AMn Leader appeared to be about 40 years old and tall, and though speaking for the most part in the NeJ d dialect, he occasionally broke into the Damasks patois. He gr e.ted me in friendly manner and after the usual compliments, came to the point of his visit namely his desire to proceed to Baghdad. When I asked him what he wanted to go there .or. he replied. -To explain to the 'Mandub as Sami'. our* diffi- culti® position. We are victorious today, and as such we consider it a suitable time to reiterate our promises of friendship with the English and to re -assure His Majesty 'sGovernment that we AKito/an.^ will not again attack tlie ' .ra or Kuwait tribes', He added that the AJchwan leaders had sent him as their envoy realizing that though all went well toda^ with them, in the long run, the man with the long j»iirse and resources would win. When that time came they thfi AKhwan no., in arms against Bin Saud intended to 'Hajir'.' They could never endure to live under Bin Saud. again. The AJman .Mutair .Ataioa ana otritr elements now fighting against Bin Saud would , he said, leave their homes for good and se-.lc other countries. I here interjecte and said, 'Such talk is foolish, how can such a tribe as the a Jman possibly leave their homes and grazing grounds in Has. a '. He quickly replied,'They went to Samawa or two years on. e ana oan easily go for more' » y jton Mashur went on 'to a3.y» ■ttia't ii.e has' ^.o ^ t ^ oil Baghdad an astiurance that the Akhwan would be allowed to enter ' iraq, and settle down there. They would »rove good soldiers ana defenders of her border. Failing assistance from »ira(f he intended proceeding to Damascus and asking the French 11 they would aoce,t them, for 'H4jlr' out of Bin Baud's dominions they | would. 8. ibn Mashur next burst into the usual violent Akhwan tirade against Bin Baud, quoting instance after instance of his su,. osed lying, breaking of his flighted word and treachery. ( He seamed visibly af ected when referring to his women and child-! ren whom, he said. Bin Saud still held in durance at Shaaiba, ^ 9. when I asked how Bin Baud got through to Biath without fighting he said it was by a trick. Firstly he had given out that in a great victory in Hassa he Bin saud had crushed the A.jman and MUtair and slain all their Shaikhs, the sn&amp;Lish assisting actively. Secondly he had promised to release ion - Humaid as soon as his daughter 'Watha' came to Riath ana claimed Mm. The first turned out to be in every way false news , ana , when the l^y -Watha' arrived and begged for her father^ release some days after Bin Baud's return to his capital. He curtly refused, to see iier or oar.y out his ^romiBe^anc. aisiniBsed her an d #arty to their homes in very summaiy fashion. As a matter of fact, he Ibn Mashur was of opinion that Iton Humaia no longer lived, and Ataiba were beginning to believe this too.-3- '• He also thought that the arrival of al Dahaina and Obeid al Httnaid in 'the west would, start trouble again. 3_ q jon Masiiur described the reoent raid, on v ^ya, whi^h was a real success. Only 19 of Bin gaudH detachment bad escaped, Al Duwish»s strength was 2500 then according to roll call figures. | great bate was taken tbat the re»ulse inflicted on the Aiinwan jy the Awazim in ipssa was not repeated. Their ,lans had be'&gt;n made extra carefully in, consequence . 11. The narration of the cutting u» of the motor convoy oet- we^-n Abu Jiff an and Hoffuf was left to Mbhamed al Athai^. Jhe latter who had comiisndea the actual raiding »arty statea tiiat. 1. cars were destroyed, and gave a aonnected account of their capture and bunking which, he said, took ,lace at four different ,laces in the Dahana. His account rang true and was given in detail. 12. Ibn jjashur thai showed me a hunch of letters ana cyjner telegrams (figure and letter) ad.rea.ed to sin Saud from Faisal and other heads of departments in Mecca. These, ne saia, had ceen captured from ^osaibi's messengers coming u» from the coast. 13. ,efore I closed the interview, Ibn jjashur asKed aiter Mr- philby and Joyce pasha and appeared dxsap ^omtea .hen i toxa him , tiie latter was not in Baghdad now. 14. Though I had be.,n warned that Ibn Mashur was more fanaticd than the rest, I fcund this not sc. There was a lot of the -Hathari' humour about him and he several times saw a joKe ana ( laughed naturally. He struck me as having more orams than the | average Bedouin and probably thelio Baghdad idea emanated from him 15. m confirmation of reports I had received from elsewhere Ito M ashur told me that Bin Saud had Individually written to all A khwan Shaikhs recently urging them to come oacJc to him wnen all would be forgiven and burUed. These letters were couched in lan- ^ g^age and persuasiveness that only Bin SaudMew how to employ, sai. Ito Mashur. So far the Akhwan had refused to listen to the 'syred voioe. 16 on my return to Kuwait and after I had sent out to Ibn * tie sent in his secretary and must quit Kuwait territory at once, . av i-p I oould arrange a safe oonau^t one Abdul A^ia of lauf to asK i t rt ^lied var bally to the messenger for him to Nuri al Shaalan- ^iCOMPIDEHHAI.

I had previously in consultation witn His Excellency tne S-tLai^ 1 # sent ADduliab. Din Jabir witn 2 cars to Al Duwisii«s camp witn instructions to oring ai- Duwisn at all costs to meet me o Time wo\iid tinus be saved as I wanted the hour^ to get off my above telegram to youo As I was about to leave I was joined by SHaikn Ahmad, wiio i iiad previously said n© would not oome^ as ne did not desire it to De reported to Bin Saud tnat ne tne snailLti i^-ad neid communication with tne arch-rebel leader* As an after thought, he said 9 he had decided to come, both because (Xf the seriousness of the situation, and as a personal guard to myself o As regards any future accusation that might come from Bin Saud he thought my presence with him would be enough to disprove of any suggestion of evil intent ion® His Excellency was extremely upset at the sudden appearance of the rebel forces inside his border. The move had been made very secretly, and the last news that had reached Kuwait was that Duwish was in the Tawai Janubi. Thefact t-Hat tJiey Jiad aix tlieir women and cnixdren witn tnem made tne Shaikh, particuaariy anxious about the situation. 'At aii costs we must save these from being bombed', he Jtept on saying. 'Both for you English, and my sates. If tnere should be a wholesale Killing of women tne results will be deplorable'. The shaikh had still another anxiety - this was that if we took air action, tne Akhwan in desperation might swoop down on Kuwait and oahara and cao -se ii J .i J e.xOulauj.e damage. Their whole strength was at subaihiyeh and all theia leaders were present. Though I had not reported it in my telegram Ho. $0}, the Akhwan leaders had talked very big to^ Abdullah ai Jabir, the previous night. 'Let the English bomb us we do not care, it will serve to show us one more enemy and we shall know what to do', they had said, and 'If our women are tilled tnen we shall move north taking jahsra and Safwan en route and proceed via tne Eupnrates to Syria, in spife of tne English'. Such and otner un necessary talk, wnich I had not considered it worth while to telegraph, nad been conveyed to Shaikh Ahmad and was distinctly worrying him. At Wara as tne road got sandy we waited to see if ax -Duwish would turn up. He arrived at 5O0 P.m., and it was a smart piece of work on Abdullah bin Jabir's part, for the Akhwan feared treachery, and made every effort to pre vent their leader seeing me. With ai-Duwish came his J song, (excluding Azaiyiz who left Hafar to raid Lena 7 days ago), ai-Puqm, Zab Sahman and three other AJman Shaikhs, in appearance ai-Duwish was short with broad shoulders. He nad a distinct stoop and a very big head. The point how ever that struck me was his long ugly nose and rather pro truding teeth. His beard was straggly and trained into a point about y inches below his chin. As usual all the members of the party wore white turbans and carried swords and Turkisn Mauser carbines.-5- On tJie whole my interview was a pleasant one, and m* tne AkJiwan leaders seemed a merry lot of rascals, friendly and willing to taik 0 I saw not tne sligiitest sign of any anxiety as to tne results of their fight with Bin Saudo One of al-Duwish^s remarts to me and which showed now the wind was blowing was, 'We have cleared northern Nejd of Bin Saud^ forces, and we have done tne British a good turn by sending back to 1 lra&lt;i some of her recalcitrant tribes like Shammar and Dhafir. We must now deal with Awazim, those fools who will not take a hint. We wish to detach them from Bin Saud, and if they will not come by kindness, we shall have to worry them by sending snipers at night and shooting up their camps 0 This will bring them to their senses&lt;, We do not wish to kill thenu They are not worth it' o After the usual premiminary salaams etc., I got His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad to open the ball, and he did it extremely well. The gist of what he said w gt o he summed up in the words 'Why Faisal, when Colonel Dickson and I had given you a dozen different warnings not to enter Kuwait under pain of being bombed, you promptly go against our warnings and sheltering yourselves under your women*s skirts invite destruction'. Al-Duwish f s reply was rather typical and was delivered with a broad smile. 'Oh Ahmad!' ne said, ' firstly let me assure you that I knew nothing of our women and camels entering your territory, as you call it f We were returning from our raids, and my 'Abd' foolishly and against all arders brought all our camels and women and set them down at Subaihiyeh. secondly . I am a man, enshaliah, and as such do not believe the English will bomb women and children, and people who have no quarrel with them.Tnlrdly . when I saw the harm 'by my 'ADd', I realized 'that ncthiiig couid be done, so I accepted the inevitable and joined the women, but the 'Abd' shall be punishedo Ponrt^ i.y .

We have no quarrel with the Haicuma, and have already told her that sue need have no fear from use Our words are those of true Mussalmin and we do not lie 0 Since we gave our word, nas 'Iraq, or Kuwait seen anything but peace on her 7 front!ers 0 Rixthly * We require nothing but water and ^razing for our camels which cannot find enough to eat or drinfc in North Hassao At Hamudh there is a lamine and all ^raz ing has finished. Here round Subaihiyen there is plenty for alio Our idea is to leave our camels and women here and issue forth into Hejd once more to carry on our fighte WUTT'T'I tiien joined in the wordy oattie, and brougHt axi &amp;ovem- mentts arguments to bear, TJie chief point I stressed was that we nad given our word to Bin Saud, with whom it was our policy to be on friendly terms, and as s^uch we couid not oreafc our word. They the Alshwan surely did not wish us to be oreaicers of words, the very thing that they were never tired of accusing Bin saud of (tne hj.t told). This and much more I talted atout till close on sunset. I then produced your telegram No.05'/, giving extract from Reuters | about their impeding destruction and defeat. This I believe did the trick. They were furious. I pressed the point, and said Bin Saud and all the world were laughing at them for entering Kuwait, as men frightened and in the last extremity of despair and fear® Duwish apparently could not stand any more, but suddenly exclaimed 'Wala'hi we nave heard enough, I shall leave Sunday at dawn for Wafra, tne Awazim's grazing grounds I shall take, and we shall enshallah have food. We will show the Hakuma if we are about to surrender to Bin Saud or not'. I said, 'Will you give me your 'kalem sharaf to this'. He replied , 'Yes, you have my 'kalam sharaf, I shall depart on Sunday at dawn.' The sun dramatically then set and Faisal himself got up and said it was time for prayer. After leading it and with Shaikh Amad behind him, he at the end, and still kneeling turned round and faced the kneeiers, and addressed Shaikh Abmad, and said, 'Oh Ahmad, do not fear, you have my word! I^Should move tomorrow morning, but the Akhwan camels are scattered.They shall be collected all tomorrow. Saturday^ and at dawn on Sunday I shall lead the way back to wafra. It will take time for the rest to follow, give them the whole of Sunday for our following is a big one'. The party then broke up, and we returned to Kuwait by 0.15 p.m. Al-Duwiah's part ing words to me were 'You must visit us and see what beau- tifuj. horses we Jiave'• ^ iiave tJae iionour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, jVcfv^ 1 ^ ^ ir-C vi.

With reference to your express message No. 325S dated 8th August, 1929 addressed to His Excellency the Hi^i Commissioner it is noted that the Sheikh of Koweit does not desire to send gun c-rews for training at Baghdad, It is thought, however, that with out such training little or no value will accrue from the mere acquisition of three Lewis Guns. In this connection I would point out that it was not Baghdad but Basrah that was mentioned by* the Air Force in the first instance as the place where the Sheikh a Koweit s men would be trained. The question of the loan of two British Instructors for training purposes is noted, but there may be some difficulty in sending capable men from the Royal Air Force as no surplus instructors are available in 'Iraq at present. I am to ask that the Sheikh' s requirements and a cceptance of the charges may be m^de to this Headquarters in due course. r h.E Air Commodore, Chie f Staff officer, Air Headquarters.&amp; I a Telegram Code Prom Political A^ent Kuwait To Adninistrative inspector, Br-sraJh.

Personal. Dear Burnett, mighty four Squadron nearly 'blundered 'badly 'by sending the reconnoitring planes over Suhaihiya Sunday. If they had 'been fired on and. had retaliated ri 'by dropping 'bomhs the fat would have 'been in the fire. Dickson had promised 'bin Dawish that if he moved on Sunday he would not see the planes, so feels that his honour as a British Officer is at stake. Cannot we devise some method by which all chance of regrettable incidents can 'be avoided ?. What do you suggest ?. Can we get the P. A. at Kuwait and the Squadron Leader at Shaihah into direct touch with one another ?. We do not want to have the political and military, who are 'both working for the same object, unwittingly pulling in different directions. If you think it would hel? matters, I will apply for a field wireless set for P. A. Kuwait. Dickson has got a personal grievance against the Jianes. It appears they came down at Kuwait 'between their first and second visits to Subaihiya and although he rushed out at once to meet them fhey flew off without waiting for him, just as he was arriving. I think thi,s is susceptible of the explanation that they did not see him coming, and I am suggesting this to him. I thought I would let you know however that he is a little 'bit sore, although it does not seem to me of sufficient importance for me to complaii about. This is of course a friendly communication from myself to you personally to see if we can reduce all chances of mi sunder standing to a inlinimum. Tt is not an offical complaint..

My Lord, v^- D-^ I have the honour to refer to Political Resident's despatch 1.0.46 dated the 20th of August, 1929, enclosing a translation of a letter from King 'Abdul 'Aziz ibn Sa'ud to the Political Agent, Kuwait, in which he seems to express the desire to open private and personal correspondence with Lieutenant- Colonel Tickson. 2. I see no objection to such a channel of private communication being opened; indeed, it appears to me to present many advantages and the more we can exchange views with Ibn Sa'ud the better our mutual relations are likely to be. 3. It is, of course, understood that such communications will be of a private and personal nature only; the normal channel of official com:::unication would still be through His Uajesty' s Agent and Consul in Jiddah - in accordance with the frequently and clearly expressed wish of King 'Abdul 'Aziz ibn Sa'ud. 4.

I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from the Air Officer Commanding on the subject of the reconnaissance sent by him to Subaihiyah on the 2nd instant, which fully explains the reasons for his action. 2, I entirely endorse the views of the Air Office r Commanding and, in view especially of the situation of the serious tension created in 'Iraq by the grave dis turbances which are taking place in Palestine, I felt also that it was essential to clear up the situation on the southern frontier of Kuwait. If the Alchwan had still been found in Kuwait territory, it would probably have been necessary to countermand reinforce ments which were under orders to proceed to Palestine. 3. I am very conscious of the admirable manner in which Lieutenant Colonel Dickson has dealt with a very delicate situation and of the desirability of doing nothing which might decrease his personal influence. At The Hon«ble Itieutenaj?it—Colonex C• C• &lt;J. Barrett, C• S. X• , C• 1 • -• i The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire .At the same time, I cannot see that 'his face has been blackened', or that any charge of breach of faith can be brought against him by Faisal-el-Dawish, or anyone ^Ise. You will remember that Lieutenant -Colonel Dickson stated, in his telegram No. 504 of the 30th August, that Faisal-el-Dawish had given his word of honour to leave Subaihiyah on Sunday 31st August with all the rebel forces, women, child.ren and camels. The air reconnaispance did not proceed to Subaihiyah until the next morning towards noon, so that if Faisal -ii -Dawish was still there when it arrived it was he who had broken his word and not Lieutenant -Colonel BicKson# 4. I would add that, in »lraq, it is not reasonable to expect any great consideration for Faisal -cl-Dawish and his companions or any unconfirmed reliance on their promises. 1 Iraq has a heavy, and as yet unsettled, account against them for past massacres and heavy losses in property and flocks and, not unnaturally, regards a large proportion of the herds for which they are so solicitous as the stolen property of 'Iraq tribes* 5. i hope that this despatch and the letter of the Air Officer Commanding will adequately explain the urgent situation which demanded imir.ediate action and left no time for the prior reference to you which is, and will continue to be, the rule in such cases# In conclusion, I desire to associate r:iys0lf v.ith the Air Officer Commanding in his expression of regret that difficulty or annoyance should have teen caused to youor to the Political Agent at Kuwait. 7.

Reconnaissances over Kuwait were frequent-ty done last Spring and early Summer without previous reference to the Political \gent Kuwait and I consider that we must reserve the right to carry out these reconnaissances in cases of emergency. I have to consider the defence of 1 Iraq. In this case to quote from telegram *.05 dated 30th \ugust from Political 'Abdullah reports serious developments - Dawish with all A.khwan leaders and whole rebel fighting strength has arrived (in Kuwait territory). Country black with tents estimates number of men 5,000 etc. etc.' Kuwait is not the only place to be considered Agent Kuwait - Thereucf -2- Thera were therefore 5,000 men, under a noted leader, within four or even three days march of the vital port of Basrah and it was therefore es-ertial, from the point of view of 'Iraq, to know what Dawish was doing. The position was further complicated by the fact that reinforcements were under orders for Palestine. If Dawish was not going to po, still more if he was on the move Northwards, it would have been essential to stop these reinforcements at once and this might have reacted seriously on the events in Palestine; so there was not only 'Iraq but Palestine and Transjordan to be cons idered. The previous reputation of Dawish is not such as to justify us in attaching much importance to his word of honour and I consider that I should not have been fulfilling my responsibility with regard to the defence of Uraq if I had sat still and hoped for the best. However, the fact that I considered my action was right does not prevent me from regretting that it caused annoyance or difficulties to the Political Agent Kuwait or the Political Resident Bushire.

British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 7th September 1929. Sir, {&gt; W 1 I have the honour to ecknowledge receipt of your letter No, S.O. 1742, dated 5th September 1929. 2. My point of view is that as Chief Political Representative in the Persian Gulf I, acting through the Political Agent at Kuwait, am responsible to the Government of India and H.M's. Secretary of State for the Colonies for events in Kuwait, So long as the situation can be controlled by peaceful means it is the duty of the Political Agent and myself to contro it. When we toui find the position getting beyond our control it is our duty to call in the military, here represented by the Royal Air Force in •Iraq.. Once v/e have called in military assist- -ance control passes out of our civilian hands till the situation has been restored to the normal. 3. In this particular case the situation had almost reached the stage when control would have been transferred to the military but thanks to the prompt measures taken by Colonel Dickson this stage was not reached. Although a warning was issued no request for military assistance was made. Such being the case it was unfortunate that without previous consult- -ation the Air Officer Commanding took the risk of upsetting all the political measures of the Political Agent at Kuwait. 4. We are all anxious to carry out the policy of His Excellency the High Commissioner for 'Iraq., Baghdad. — rof His Majesty's aovernment, which is to exclude the /Uchwan rebels from Kuwait. There has merely 'been a slight misunderstanding as to the 'best means of achieving this end. I am sincerely grateful to Sir Bohert Brooke Popham and yourself for the sentiM- -ments expressed at the conclusion of y )ur letters and I can assure you that I am anxious only to co- -operate whole heartedly with the Boyal Air Force. This incident, which fortunately had no untoward result, shows how necessary is the free exchange of information 'between departments. You did the political Agent and myself the favour of informing us hy telegram that reconnoitring planes were 'being despatched to Subaihiya. Had this information been sent before instead of after the asroplanes had left all chance of an unfortunate incident would have 'been avoided. 5. An argument with the Arahs as to whether Colonel Dickson's or Paisal 'bin Dawish's face had 'been 'blackened hy an encounter at Suhaihiya is a subject which obviously should 'be avoided. To get the best results a British officers word should be above suspicion. I hold no brief for Faisal bin Dawish, quite the reverse, but I must point out that he left at dawn on Suliday according to his word and his followers were on the move immediately afterwards. The danger was from the action of hot-heads among them these followers. If some of XkKxs had fired on the planes, these, which appear to have been carrying bombs, would no doubt have retaliated and not only would all the good results of the political action have been wasted but the very result of delaying reinfore ementsreinforcements for Palestinei which the Air Officer Commanding was wishing to avoid, would have 'been 'brought ahout, 6. I am in complete sympathy with the Air Officer Commanding*s desire to clear up the situation, especially in view of the call made 'by Palestine on the Royal Air Force in 'Irag, ahoat which I was not previously cognisant, 'but, in my view, Colonel Dickson, who has shown himself to 'be in close touch with the movements of the rebels, would 'be trusted to report whether Faisal 'bin Dawish had kept his word. In fact I received his No. 508, reporting that Dawish had gone, some time 'before his 510, stating that he had seen aeroplanes, ahout which he had no information, flying towards Suhaihiya and asking that a protest 'be made as he had purposely avoided asking for any areo- -plane reconnaissance. 7. The Political Agent, Kuwait, already has instructions to give all information direct to you. If the Air Officer Commanding so desires I am prepared to authorise him to communicate direct with any officer of the Royal Air Force he may name 'but I request that, to assist that cooperation of flivial and Military which is obviously so desirable, the Political Agent, Kuwait, may 'be informed 'beforehand of any flights over Kuwait territory in sufficient time to enable him to protest if necessary. He will naturally make no objection except for very strong reasons. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies and to the Government of India.

He has, however, communicated his views to me on the question. The appointment of a Special Service Officer appears to have been made early in 1920 (reference this office telegram No.3l/S dated the 17th of February, 1928, and the Political Resident's reply No.234 dated the 25th of February, 1928). The appointment seems only to /'/6 have been temporary, but in 1929 the Air Officer Commanding desired once more to send a Special Service Officer and the matter was referred to the Political Resident, Bushire. His approval was received in telegram No.120 dated the 4th of March, 192^, in which telegram, both the Political Agent Kuwait and the Shaikh were described as 'welcoming the idea'. Demi-official correspondence between Colonel /W AJ-C r &gt; /b* i , _ , . + j&gt; , , ') Dent and Lieu ten ant-Colonel More, at the time when it 'Cwt,/ av /O' ^ ' in /6 y t r , Jim was first proposed in 1928, to send a Special Service ■ /&lt;3 ? Officer, seems to have laid down the status of the appo intment-2- ry appointment and the work which the Special Service Officer was required to do. The Air Officer Commanding tells me that he feels that the arguments for retaining the right to send a Special Service Officer to Kuwait are no less now than when the idea was first mooted. He points out that the relations between the Special Service Officer at Kuwait and the Political Resident are analogous to those 'between a Special Service Officer and the local Administrative Inspector in 1 Iraq. The Special Service Officer reports direct to the Air Officer Commanding and it is regarded as essential that his status in this respect should 'be maintained. At the same time copies of his reports, both written and telegraphic, are always given to the Administrative Inspector, who is frequently consulted and shown the draft before despatch in order that he may comment upon its contents. The Air Officer Commanding would wish that a similar system, which has worked very smoothly and without any friction in ^Iraq, should be observed in Kuwait, but he adds that he must ask to retain the power to send a Special Seiirice Officer to Kuv/ait when he considers it necessary. With regard to Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson's accusation that Captain Burton sends news which is ♦♦often quite unnecessarily alarmist', the Air Officer Commanding observes that no such communications have been noted in his Headquarters, nor have any comments from kuw^-(- tft-' ^ • II)''/ 1 '' , I z/?/^ -- — if 1 'J, ;—L__ 7o cu 7i; //s-a -i.-* /&lt;rv &lt;/ P' : : ? | ' er^ \ 1 I &lt; ' V-^.

It seems to me that the arrangement ought to run perfectly smoothly in accordance with the procedure outlined by the Air Officer Commanding as it does in •Iraq, where there is the additional complication of the 'Iraqi Mutasarrif to be taken into account. It should only be a matter of a little 'give and take' and the maintenance of close and sympathetic personal relations. In any case, the question really seems to be one for you and the Air Officer Commanding and I do not see that I have really any business to interfere, except in an endeavour to assist towards an efficient system which will satisfy both parties.

Vff Reference yonr D-O® dated 20th August asking for a defination of Bin Saud^ regular forces. I have the honour to report that Bin Saud divids his armed forces into the following classes (a) Regulars* (h) Akhwan 0 (c) Aarab^Lo 2© Taking (a). These,so called 'Regulars'; are nothing more or less than his 'Fidawi' troopSc They receive regular monthly pay, but wear no special uni form. Most of them are of the 'hathar' class as opposed to the 'Badia'. This does not mean to say they are townsmen necessarily, for you will always find men from different tribes employed as Pidawis. A good example of the type recruited,are the Shaikh of Kuwait Fidawi forces stationed at Jahara. perhaps the best English name that could be given them, would be ' ga^d Mercenaries '*. for They are for the most part chosen ±rmB. their reliability, and carry out the direct orders of Bin Saud^ Amirs etc., whereas under category (b) (c) the individual fighter carries out his Shaikhs orders firsto The garrisons of the 'Kuts' or forts which dominate-2- Hail, HoffuT, Mubawaz and Qatif Tor instance of tnese so called 'Regular' troops♦ Messages to tribal leaders other towns and tne guarding 01 prisoiiers and collecting of zitot etc is entrusted to these per sons* They go under the name of 'Sir^iyah' (singular) and 'Sar^aya' (.p^uraxjo The AXkiwan effect fo dispise them and call them 'Hatharis'® Th-e AkJiwan (b) on the other nand weiu brougxit into being by Bin baud to fight his battles and win them in the name of ReXlgion. As Badouins tney would never nave oeen reliable, as AitJawan and inflamed by tithe Din' they became well night invincible. They may be likened to Cromwell' s'Iron sides' or the German 'Sti?om Troops'. For the rest these fanatics are too well known to need further description. Suffice to say, when they attack, they have a regular drill which consists of dismounting from their camels and horses, and advancing shoulder to shoulder infantry fashion, and in several lines. Their boast is that they never run nor are tempted to sheer out of the fight as ordinary Bedouins do when on ho^eback. If an 'Akhu' is slain his place is im mediately taken by another. There is no pause in the forward progress, or so their drill nas it, iiieir motto is 'move swiftly and secretly to your oojective, wnen there, attacit on foot', A regular reserve is always maintained in lear to rainforce where necessary. Such manoeuvres as dawn attacks, night attacks, flank and rear attacks, etc, etc., are regularly understood and practiced. The Akhwan look upon themselves as the elect of G-od and the creme de la creme of Bin Saud's troops. For this reason^they feel confident of ultimate success in their rebellion against Bin Saud. Theirs may beliltened to a imitiiiy of Bin Saud's pretorlan guard ratiier tJaan a rebeiiiorio T^e Akliwan despise (a) the sarraya and (b) the Aarah, 4, Tii© 'Aarab' are tlx© ordinary Ba'dia or Bedouin aiiiea of Bin Saud, and a certain amount of them usuaiiy accompany the Atiiwan on a Ghazzu. For instance when ai -Duwish made his recent march across X&gt;0 miles of waterless desert and struct, at the Shei and Sahooi at Gaiyeh, he was accompa nied toy a numtoer of Ajman 'Aarab', These were used as scouts patrols etc. and when the final attacic was launched, skirmished ahead. The Aknwan were the heavy infantry and main-stay of the attack. They also formed the Reserveo 5, It should toe realized that not every Matairi or Ajmi is an Akhwan; only those of them who feel that way, join the ranks of the elect.

You will notice that the name Jariyah has been used in several instanceso This place does not exist and ap parently steps have not been taken to have the name deleted from E.A.F« maps, vide my despatch llo 0 ^A- A dated 20th June 1^2^ and last paragraph 0 The motor car mentioned in messages 'B' and 'D' be longed to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. It brought out a special party of six selected men, who at my suggest ion were sent out to hurry on the laggards and 'beat up' those not getting a proper H move on.' It being recollected that al-Duwish himself with his principal chiefs had already left on Sunday morning at dawn 0 a . Por vour information, tiie wells on which the Akhwan wfere actually campea on were;AX Tawix Subaih-iyeii Al Suben Siiinaiti Arfigiyeh (on border line) t) 0 As I have already given my views on tiie sending of tiie air reconnftisance in question in ray telegrams referred to at tne head of this despatch, I do not propose to maXe any further remarks on the subject here,, The effect however of the incident on His Excellency the Shaikh was unfortunate and is given below. bo On my return from the aerodrome where I had failed to meet the Commander of the p t econnaissance (as reported by wire) I proceeded straight to the shaikh's oflicial residence in the Town, to explain that I was entirely unaware of the intention to send aeroplanes. I found him in a state of great agitation, and before I was allowed to say anything he started upbraiding me for having 'let him down' and not told him I was sending for aeroplanes® When I told him I knew nothing of the whole business, he expressed great astonishment, and asked now it v^as they could come without my knowledge or pemission, who re presented His Majesty's Government in Kuwait. He then turned to what was his and my immediate anxiety. V/e had seen 4- machines go in the direction of ^ubaihlyeh bj.t o^xly had been seen to land on the aerodrome and fly away again and apparently in great hurry. Everyone was saying, he said, that tney had heard the explosion of bombs, and he greatly feared a disaster, and that the Akhwan who were in a surly mood at havingbeen made to move had opened iire, and had shot down a plane. As I was trying to reassure the agitated man that 'B' telegram had distinctly said there was no firing, and that I sincerely hoped all was well, a messenger rushed in bringing nessage 'C% which clearlyindicated that ail was well and machines were leaving for Shaibah (they never came near Kuwait on return journey) I immediately read it out to the Shaikh, and I have never seen a man so x 8± xxje A relieved. He kept on repeating w Thank G-od, Thank G-od, I never believed the Akhwan could have restrained themselves, with the Duwish of all men not present', He obviously was in a high nervous state, for he then asked me why he had been treated like this? He had always understood he said that his permission was to be asked, before any machines landed at Kuwait, He would never refuse such permission of course, he added, but it was his right to expect to be asked if only as a matter of courtesy, and he hoped I would remind the autho rities in Baghdad that he would like to be infomed in future if any aeroplanes desired to visit Kuwait whether they were Government machines or those of Imperial Airways. He referred again and again to the 'extraordinary tact lessness' as he called it, of the H.A*F» at their rushing in, when he and I were engaged in the delicate business of getting a disturbed hornets nest quietly out oi his dominions. The Akhwan were in mood to sting anyone who came near them, he said, and for aeroplanes to swoop down to i;?00 feet and O00 feet range and stay there taking notes was as if they were deliberately trying to provoke a hostile response in order that they could get an excuse ('haoda') to bomb. 'Where', added Shaikh Ahmad, 'in the world, would you have found anyone in the position that the Akhwan were in, and expectesi them not to ppenv{^ f ire. They could not but have believed that Wt&amp;w were coming to bomb® y, I managed to calm His Excellency down before I left, and I am sure he did not mean half of what he said. No doubt his excitement had got the better of him for the' 4 ' €J) ? for iiie moment for the fear that perhaps two British officers had been killed had upset him very greatly and added to the mummami. indignation he felt at being 'lefi~ down'. 5.

The question of the appointment was originally opened demi-officially between Dent andT More, who felt that his position did not allow him to engage on Intelligence work which might make his position vis-a-vis the Shaikh somewhat difficult.

I have tne honour to ac^nowledte the receipt of ^out letter wo. 1C97/-S-i/lSS of 1 i.i.l34b (21.6.29) concerning certain cooperative measures oii the part of tne British Government against some of i .ls Majesty's subjects wi^c are being pursued. The hejar. Government appreciate the British uoveruiient's friendly attitude which has come as a fresh proof of the best of the mutual and friendly sympathy existing between the two countries. As regards the Hejaz Governmeat's request that the British .^overiimeut should consent to trie pursuit of fugitives from Hejaxl forces, iu originally rests on a desire to destroy tne disaffected persons and to deprive them of any opportunity of committing fresn offences. i^ow Uiat tne British Government have undertaKen to do tnic; botii in Kov.eil and in Iraq, tnis is all tnat »iaa revested. with reference to your statement in para*, raph % of your note regarding tne Gheikh of Ko«eit'6 denial of tiie allegatlone of his xi&amp;vint given assistance, the Hejas ooveriiraent believe, as 1 have had the pleasure of expressing, both verbally and in writing,writiiug, to Mr. JaKiiib, that tae ohelKJu does not intend to injure the hejaz Government, nor does he intentionally do harm to them, and tney accept the assurancee forwarded to them on tiiia point. The information received the i.ejaz entirely (Jovernmeut^Salls to show that aiiy of the Avazira and tne loyal /Mchwan tove taken any action of the kind mentioned in paragraph 4 of your Note under reference, stating that the . heikh of Ko&gt; eit believes in its occurrence, especially since there 1 b enmity of old standing between the Awazim and tue Ajcoau, ivnicii is so well known tnat it leaves no room for doubl about tne impossibility of one party's helping the otner. ihe iieja^s Government would however be very grateful if tiie oheikh could give trie names oi some of these persons and the approximate dates of their movements in this coiiiiexion. In case it is proved to have actually happened thib will help considerably in discovering tne facts which you were t&gt;ood enough to say that the British Government are anxious to determine. It remains for me to mention one more point in connexion «ith this subject. Ihis concerns what you mentioned in paragraph 2 of your letter, regardixi^ the cooperation of British forces with the forces of tiie bneikh of Kov^eit, for thiu indicates, if 1 am not mistaken, that the measures about to be taken will be confined to the prevention of the use of Koweit territories for unlawful activities. You will realise, however, that the benefit of this will not be complete unless measures are taken to place obstacles in their path Wherever they may be, whether in Ko^eit or in i^ejdi territory. 1 request you thereforetnerefore to draw tne brltlea Government' b attention to the fact that the question will naturally be solved when their reply to the rest of the BUgoestlons contained in my last letter to which you refer is received.

Sir, I have the honour to refer you to my telegram NOo y . 909 dated g^rd August and your telegram Ho.040 dated the 24tii August 1929- 2. On receipt of your a 'bovementioned reply I went and saw Sliaiiih Abmad and discussed the whole question with him fully. At liis invitation I also went over his armoury and inspected with him his stocks of rifles and reserve ammunition. It is as well that I did so, for t the Sliaiiili apparently liad eveiy intention of following Up his request for 100,000 rounds of Turkish ammunition, with a further request later on. As he put it to me himself, he was anxious not to ask for his full require ments all at once, lest G-overnment should possibly think his demands were excessive. There was also the possibili' he added, of the adherants of Bin Saud, always very active in Kuwait, informing their master that he the Sliaikh. of Kuwait was purchasing ammunition to send to the insurgents, and he did not desire such accusation to be put forward on top of all others that Bin Saud had made • against him. As a result of my investigations, I found that the Siiaikh possesses a good stock of(a) TurJiisii Army Mausers. (b) G-eiman Arjuy Mausers. (c) British. 00^ short rifles, about an equal proportion of each. He has practically no ammunition in reserve, and this applies to all three classes. I exclude of course the Lewis gun reserve which he recently received from India, &gt; The Shaikh now wishes to buy the following amounts of S.A«A., to bring his reserves up to a decent figure. I put them forward in the form of a consolidated indent. (a). 100,000 rounds H.V.Pointed bullet, to suit the Turkish Army Mauser rifle. (b) ±00,000 -do- -do- to suit the Geman Army Mauser rifle. (c) 100,000 -do- -do- to suit British 00^ rifles. The Shaikh has Already enquired from Germany as regards price etc through a certain Herr Willnow of Bremen who visited Kuwait sometime back. The latter recently advised him that (b) could be supplied at once, and landed a^ Kuwait for 2^&amp; a hundred (fresh and guaranteed stock). The same firm said they would quote figures shortly, for numbers required under (a). b. If you are able to arrange for the supply of both (a) (b) and (c) througJti His Majesty^ G-overnment, the S-haikh would be very grateful, and would far prefer this arrange ment, as he is anxious above everything to do things above board^ and always with your and His Majesty«s Government's approval. As regards the bores of (a) and (b). As neither the Shaikh nor I can give these without running the risk of making a mistake. i am sending under separate packet two cartridges duly labelled, of the types required, it will be sufficient to say that the smaller of the two is that used by the Turkish regular army now^and the larger by the Geiman military forces during the war, each being slightly larger than our own .&gt;0^ ammunition./s b. I am of opinion we can with perfect safety allow the Shaikh, to purchase the above quantity, especially as I 'believe it is part of our policy to encourage him to put his house in order, and not always feel dependent on us as he has been inclined to do in tne past, ^00,000 rounds on paper may sound a large amount at first sight but taking the total number of armed men whom he keeps up, at 400, this gives us, at 200 rounds per man, o0,000 rounds issued, and only 220,000 in reserve. A mere no thing when compared with the $ million rounds which Bin Saud recently purchased from us, also if we consider that little petty actions are of almost monthly occurrence along tne frontier. y. Shaikh Ahmad trusts that you will see your way to support his request, and asks that you enquire tele graphically from His Majesty's Government London as to whether they can supply (a) and (b) at the figure, or lower than that quoted from Bremen. The only condition that shaikh Abmad makes is that tne ammunition be new of up to date quality, and not old war stock. Should His Majesty^ G-overnment not be able to undertake the supply, the Shaikh trasts you will allow him to make his own arrangements direct. As regards his requirements under (c) he tiusts you will be able to arrange the matter direct with India. It goes without saying that he will purchase all the ammunition he asks for, but he hopes there will not be much delay as he wishes to avoid this. xO. I have written this somewhat lengiihy despatch. - I rather than telegraph the contents, as I desired to ex plain how it was that whereas my original telegram Ho.y09 under reference only made mention of Turkish Mauser am munition, the Shaikh no?/ desires to have both a supply of G-erman as well as British ammunition also.

IN my telegram No. 130 of the 10th instant 1 touched brieHy on the conditions in the Hejaz, and I mentioned then that the political and financial situation was becoming steadily worse. 2. In view of recent and possible developments, it may be of interest if I amplify the information contained in my telegram and give a resume of the main features of the situation as it is to-day and as it appears to Jeddah and Mecca opinion, with which I am in touch. 3. Ever since Feisal-ed-Doweish threw oft the veil of his doubtful allegiance and declared himself openly in rebellion against Ibn Sand the (jovernment has had to deal with a growing restiveness and lawlessness among the tribes, which has vented itself in incidents of major or minor importance, and which has now brought the Government face to face with a critical situation, resembling in many ways the position at the beginning of the Great War, when the llejaz was menaced by the revival of the militant Wahabi power, to which it eventually succumbed. 4. There is a general feeling abroad now in Jeddah and Mecca among the better-informed classes, whether sympathetic or hostile to the present regime, that the fate of the Hejaz and of Arabia in general may at any time within the next few months be staked upon the issue of a decisive battle between Ibn Saud and the rebel forces. There does, in fact, seem little doubt that the King s position in Arabia is shortly to be put to a searching test. Openly, every confidence is professed in the result. In private, one observes an undercurrent of anxiety, and anxiety which, fed by the successive rumours of gossip-mongers, sees its justification in the exceptional measures taken by Ibn Saud to provide for the coming conflict. Doubts are expressed as to his ability in certain eventualities to control the situation in the interior; such eventualities might result, for instance, from a succession of coups, possibly of small importance in themselves, in which the Akhwan were victorious. Their prestige is such that, given a reasonably successful start, they are likely to attract active sympathy and co-operation from all sides. 5. It would be futile to attempt a comparison between the strength of the rival forces. These vary almost from day to day, and they would fluctuate in accordance with the varying fortunes of the campaign. According to the local representative of the Minister of Finance, Ibn Saud has strong detachments based on Hail, Tebuk, Medina and Riyadh. His position is a strong one. He has all the material if not the moral advantages on his side, and, above all, he has relative freedom of movement and has had time to prepare for a campaign. Whatever the risks may be, therefore, his forces have every chance of success provided that he himself survives. On the other side, the rebels are also believed to be well armed, but one may infer from the deputations and appeals to the Sheikh of Koweit and their anxiety to avail them selves of the Koweit grazing grounds that they are severely handicapped by lack of supplies. Numerically, also, they must be at a great disadvantage. 6. The chief weakness of the King's position lies in the inferior moral of his army as compared with the fanatical enthusiasm and desperate courage of the Akhwan and in the general unpopularity of his rule. As a result of the latter, it is generally believed that, except in Nejd proper, the majority of the tribes would rise at once if there were any reasonable hope of throwing off his yoke. Added to this is the fact that he is unable to rely on a large number of troops who have been enrolled in the south by attractive promises and by enforced levies, and who have not got their heart in the fight; they include, for instance, a number of Arabs of the Ataibah tribe, of which several sections are in open defection. Many of these troops have been sent to Medina, and thence drafted to other bases, while some 7,000 are distributed at different posts between Taif and Henakiya to provide against surprises. In Nejd itself, to judge from the small number of tribal chiefs of importance who are reported to be with him at Riyadh, he does not appear to have succeeded in rallying the tribes to his side and has had to fill his ranks largely \\ ith townsmen. [927 x—1]') 7. Another weakness is the fact that the defection of the Akhwan has to a large extent discredited him among the more fanatical and influential elements of his own following. People like Abdulla-bin-Hasan, a descendant of Abdul Wahhab, who was chiefly responsible for the recent dismissal of the imams at Mecca and Medina, Abdulla-bin-Blaihid, until last year Grand Qadi of Mecca, Mohammed-bin- Ali Turky, who resigned the same post a few months ago, are commonly believed to favour the Akhwan cause, while Abdul Latif, another descendant of Abdul Wahhab and one of the most influential ulemas at Riyadh, is reported to have left Riyadh and to have definitely gone over to Feisal-ed-Doweish. Ibn Saud is beginning to be regarded by these fanatics as no longer true to Wahhabi tenets and as being himself now no better than an infidel. Their support of him is, in any case, likely to be luke warm only, as they themselves would stand to lose by any diminution of the fanatical Akhwan influence. 8. Signs and incidents are not wanting to alarm the inhabitants of Jeddah and Mecca. Following on the recent conp of Feisal-ed-Doweish at Qaya came the ^ news, confirmed from various sources, of the Emir Baud's narrow escape from capture on his way to Hasa, when fourteen out of seventeen cars are said to have been taken and their occupants killed. This was followed by the defection of the Beni Amr of the Nejdi Harb, a fact which is symptomatic of the unhealthy condition of the regions around Medina and Henakiya and further north. 9. The situation in the Northern Hejaz has its repercussion in the south in the growing truculence of the Ataibah, as shown by acts of aggression which have lately been committed by them. I may refer again to the attacks on the two caravans on the Mecca-Taif road, where perfect security was thought to exist, and 1 may mention the arrest of Abdulla-bin-Hassan, whose great religious prestige was expected to guarantee him a safe passage from Mecca to Riyadh, whither he was being sent with gold and with arms and ammunition. He was apparently allowed by the Ataibah to proceed after giving the most solemn assurances that he would secure the release of their chief, Ibn Bujad, but from all accounts the gold, arms and ammunition were retained by the Ataibah. 10. It is now practically established that the punitive expedition sent against them under the well-known Wahhabi leader, Khalid-bin-Lowai, has been checked or defeated, and Khalid himself is believed to have withdrawn to Khurma, whither reinforcements have been sent. 11. It will not be an easy task to bring the Ataibah to heel. Naturally turbulent, connected by blood relationships with the Ashraf, and akin also to the recalcitrant Mutair,they have latterly become impatient over the continued detention of Ibn Bujad in Riyadh. The task will be made no easier by the fact, if it proves to be true, that the tribes around Turaba and further south into Asir, e.g., the Beni Shahran, have become disaffected. 12. In view of the state of affairs as described above, it is not to be wondered at that the moral of the local Hejazi is shaken. Communication with the north is difficult and takes considerable time. Rumours of defeats are exaggerated and good news, meagre as it is, is received with a scepticism born of many disappointments. The black side of things, therefore, looms large before his anxious eyes, and he derives little comfort from a situation which, for all its brighter aspects, is wrapped in uncertainty. To add to his gloom, the cost of all such commodities as are normally purchased from the interior, e.g., mutton and butter, has risen considerably and is still rising. The cost of mutton, for instance, is doubled. 13. As indicated, though, in my telegram No. 130 of the 10th September, the conditions of the country, although far from satisfactory, is to a large extent the natural consequence of the period of suspense through which it is passing in antici pation of a definite solution by battle of the question of supremacy. It should not be forgotten either that, although latterly there has been peace and security in the Hejaz, disturbances, raiding and counter-raiding on a larger or lesser scale is a normal state of affairs in Arabia. 14. The political situation is still further complicated by the present financial crisis. The Government is having the greatest difficulty in raising money to satisfy the King's requirements and to meet other calls. An attempt to raise a loan among local Jeddah merchants has had no success. Customs dues, as reported in my telegram No. 119 of the 15th August last, have been collected in advance on orders placed, although the goods are not due to arrive for months ahead. Large increases have been made in the customs tariff on tobacco and certain other commodities {vide my despatch No. O.T. 9 of the 9th August). Cash which merchants at Yambo,3 Wejh, &amp;c., wish to remit to Jeddah is often commandeered by Government repre sentatives, and drafts on the customs are given in exchange. These drafts, which now constitute the usual method of payment, are rapidly losing, value, although it is still possible to negotiate them with the more influential merchants at a 5 per cent, discount; it is impossible except in rare cases and by bribery to realise them on pre sentation. An appreciable proportion of Government funds is diverted into improper channels and finds its way into the pockets of the higher Government officials and of the hmir Feisal itself, while the sums that are sent to Riyadh are, trom all accounts, expended by the King in true Royal fashion. A form of taxation has been introduced among the tribes around Taif by which each tribe is called upon to supply a fixed number of men and camels for the arms, failing which a fine of £8 per camel and £13 for each fighting man short of the number is inflicted. This tax is causing widespread discontent. Finally, there is a report from Mecca to the effect that lunds held on trust on account of deceased persons estates are, despite the injunctions of the Koran, being used by the Government for its own needs. 15. The fact is that the Government cannot afford the maintenance of a large military establishment which circumstances have forced upon it; nor can it look for relief until the present situation is liquidated, and what now forms a large standing army, judged by Arabian standards, is effectively reduced. 16. T am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's High Commis sioners for Egypt, Iraq and Palestine, the Governor-General of the Sudan, the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, the Political Resident, Aden, the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Koweit, and the senior naval officer, Red Sea Sloops.

I was much gra'Cified at this expression of Your Majesty^ sincerity of heart and it showed very clearly that Your Majesty remembered the days when I had the honour of being your guest at Haffuff as well as tne many friendly and intimate conversations which we had together then. 2. Whilst I desire^ to offer Your Majesty full apology for not having replied to your letter earlier, I should like to say that the delay in doing so has been due solely to the fact, that it became necessary for me to re fer the letter itself, as well as certain other points re- ^e^red to in it to His Majesty^ ^o v ernment 0 This all took Time. In addressing Your Majesty now I wish first of all to say that I am fully aware of the correspondence which has passed between Your Majesty ann TT ioHis Majesty»s G-overiment witii regard to tiiose rebels from among your subjects who have their concentrations in the neignbourhood of Kuwaiti 4o I should also like to make it ahundently clear to Your Majesty that the Respected of All, and Your Majesty^ good friend^His Excellency tne Shaikh of Kuwait,together with myself have 'been constant in our efforts to prevent supplies in the shape of food, ammunition etc&lt;, reaching tne rebels from the very beginning of tiiese troubles, nor are we I in any way lessening our efforts at tne present moment. % As regards tne crossing of any of the Ajman,]iutair or Ibn Mashur's rebel tribesmen into Kuwait territory,Your Majesty may rest assured that not only do none of the above mentioned Bedouins attempt to cross the border openly but L their leaders from Faisal ai Duwish downwards have received V several stern warnings both from Shaikh Ahmad and myself both in writing and verbally tnat should any of tne Akhwan in their efforts to escape^ endeavour to take refuge in Kuwait territory they will be immediately ejected, and by bombing if necessary* That a certain amount of food gets out to the rebels secretly is probably true, but with the tight control on the export of all foodstuffs that the Shaikh has imposed, such secret dealing^ I would ask you to believe, iias been reduced to a minimum. || be It may interest Your Majesty to learn that on tne I'/th Habi I, i^4o (=22nd August iy2y) Ibn Mashur sent in a message asking for permission to proceed to Baghdad under safe conduct and interview His Excellency tne High Commis- f sioner. as he was not allowed to come closer than ^asr f Mishrif, I saw him there and conveyed his request to His Majesty's Government. The reply 1 received was that Ibn Mashur's request was to be categorically refused, and that Jae must quit Kuwait territory at once® I conveyed tne message to ibn Mashur and he was forthwith ejected on 10th Rafci I, 1^40 J= 2^rd August iy2y).

On that day Shaikh Ahmad*3 patrols on the southern border reported that Faisal al Iiuwishls family accompanied by all the v/omen and children of the Mutair and ^ashaida ■ ;i: large numbers of camels under the charge of al Duwish's head slave had crossed the border and had camped at Su- baihiyeh under the plea that water and 'aSiiUu' Wdo very scarce round he^udh and y /afra. She same evening and while His Excellency the Huler of Kuwait was making arrangements to eject them, came the further news that Faisal al Euwish himself with all the Akhwan leaders had also arrived at Subaihiyeh. 'ihey were immediately iollowed Dy ail --' o Ajman v /ith several thousand of tueir women, oj-d-men cJia children. On the morning of the 2;?tii Eabi, (,=&gt;Oth August) as the situation w^s critical and as it was undesiraole that we should bomb the Akhwan women and children of wiiom there were several thousands present, I decided to go to Subaihiyeh myself and warn al iiuwlsh that he must leave at once otherwise his -ajesty's Government could not hold itself responsible for the consequences. Accompanied by His Excellency the ahaikh i met Faisal al Duwish and other xa Akhwan leaders at Wara, and I thank God thai; our mission was successful. That we were able to induce the Akhwan to leave without our having to ham their women and childrei was due first to God, and secondly to the splendid support which Shaikh Ahmad gave me. As it was huwish left oy dawn on Sunday 2Vth Habil (= 1st September) with all his people and not a single Akhwan man, woman or camel remained at' SuDaiiiiyeii or in Kuwait territory by tiie evening of tne 1st HaDi II, 1^40 4tii September i^idyo o.

(c) is believed to be a brother of the rebel leader now in arms against Bin Saud in Qassim,^and acts as courier between Baghdad and Kuwait vide Special Service Officer Basrah^s report I/Bs/l Part IV (d) for period ending 11th September iy2y.

In this connection please see Diaries lJo,ll paragraph '/O, No.i^ paragraph yb. IJo ^j.4 paragraph 102 and Ho^i!? paragraph lib (b). 2o His Excellency stated that (a) and (b) mentionedabove, on arrival attempted to engage a motor car to take tJaem to Wafra and visit Faisal al Duwisli. As lie iiad however forbidden all communications witli tne rebels the necessary car was unobtained and the persons came and petitioned him for a car&lt;, He refused their request of course« His Excellency further stated that he has been aware that for some time past there have been certain movements of mysterious emisaries between Kuwait and Baghdad, but he has not complained officially because such persons have come armed with regular certificates of Identity issued by the Baghdad authorities^ 4. 0 Seeing however that there can be no longer any doubt that these persons are acting as n go between' between persons in 'Iraq, and tiie rebels. His Excellency has deeided that the time has come to take action. Jhat has persuaded him to move more than anything else has been the presence in Kuwait of Bin saud's confidential agent Abdul Aziz al BUbai for the last three weeks, and the fact that this person has more than hinted that tne Shaikh would do well to prevent sucn people visit ing Kuwait as in duty bound he had to repol ?j5 movements of suspicious persons to his master® As His Excellency said to me, 'I have enough accusations of my own from Bin Saud torefute^ without bringing on my head the charge that i am encoura^-ig ./ell knovm refugees from Bin Saud's Government in »Ira&lt;i * ^ in their intrigues with the Rebels* What His Excellency now asks is that if you see no objection , His Excellency the High Commissioner may be approached with the request tnat the individuals named above, be watched and refused further permission to visit Kuwait, and that all po . jce oil icers in ' Iraq^be warned not to issue Certificates of Identity to tlie^ without previous reference to Kuwait 8 He furtiier suggests tnat a list oe Kept of sucii undesirables in His Excellency tne High commissioner 1 s office and that as occasion arises the names of suspicious pursons may be added on receipt of a telegram from this office, bo Finally His Excellency says ne would have acted before, but for his anxiety not to offend possibly import ant persons in 1 Iraq..

One thing is known however, it is that (a) the original force numbered &gt;00; (^b) en route to Lauqa, 100 men were sent back in charge of two large bodies of raided camexs. (c) Faisal ai-Shiblan*s detachment numbered about 00, and 100 survivors have definitely returned to Wafra ^This leaves $20 with Azaiziz unaccountedPersonally I am of opinion that Azalziz did not escape and that he with &gt;20 men were killed. We shall hear the truth no doubt in a few days. Ibn M'saad^ success was the result of clever work, and he brought off his coup by filling up certain wells, and denying the water of Urn er Rudhumzna to a weary and very thirsty force as represented by Azaiziz raiders. These fought to get to the water but failed. As regards, (b). The news here is that ai-£]orxxli Duhaina is veiy much alive and is creating a lot of trouble 'but as this comes from insurgent sources, it must be accepted with caution. Bin Saud himself says nothing about his death in a long letter dated ^Oth August which Shaikh Ahmad received by last up mail (l^th September iy2y}. This letter was a particularly friendly one and a precis of it is given in the following paragraphs. (a). He thanked the shaikh of Kuwait for so kindly entertaining Abdur Hahman yosaibi and for the messages sent him by that individual« § (h). He hoped 'before long to personally arrange a meeting with iis 'brother' the Shaikh of Kuwait. Ee would arrange the date later. (Shaikh Ahmad knows nothing about this meeting,). (cj. He would long ago have se^t out on his expe dition to punish the insurgents, but the heat was too great. (dj. The people of Hejd proper and passim had recently refused to provide troops, wherer * with to attack the Akhwan in hassa, their excuse 'being tnat the country was so disturbed in their midst tnat he Bin Saud must first settle the trouble at home before asking them to move to a distance. (e). That al-Duhaina sent hy Faisal al-Duwish was♦ f m creating a lot of trouble in yassiia, but ne iiad several forces engaged in trying to bring hiin to action, including a force sent from Hejaz by his son Paisalo Until tliis person was •»settled' there could be no move nortlu (f). That his troops had indeed surprised al-Duhaine once and taken many camels, but the man him self was still at large and creating much mischief. 40 Reading between the lines, it would seem that Bin Saud is too concerned with affairs nearer home to feel strong enough to start on an expedition against the northern insurgents yet* Shaikh Ahmttd states there undoubtedly is serious trouble in Aarea and Qassim and reads Bin Saud f s letter as confirming this. At the same time, says Shaikh Ahmad, Bin Saud must if he'is to save his kingdom, make one big effort to tackle al-Duwish, in the next month or two. 5* The various rumours from Llecca, London and else where that Bin Saud's forces were coverging on the rebels £cc are so much 'moonshine' and will only be quoted by the rebels as examples of the stupid lies with which Bin Saud is trying to blester up his cause. b e The actual position of Bin Saud's forces today is follows (a)* The 'Awasim/ tribe are at Mulaija miles North of Nta) under Mubarak Ibn Drai and Ibn Jami. They are assisted by contingents of Bani Khalid^ai-Manassir, Bani Ha^ir, Qahtan and Sahool -(all small)* Also by a detachment of 250/^00 of Bin Saud's regulars (sarraya). The whole force numbers about 2500 and is hampered by the mn-numberable ip-rw pro-Bm Sauai'ces xiku to think there is- Cc) # At Aji'b'ba is camped ^'bn M^aad with the original concentration he has had all along (Shammar, al~ Earb and a contingent of Hathar from the Qassim towns) o Total about Ibn ikpsaad has not sent, nor does he contemplate moving up any of his forces to Haffar al Batin, as far as one can see. Such force would be too exposed to a sudden attack. The stories circulated from nassa that Abdulla 'bin Abdur Rahman as-Saud has arrived al Awainat South of Nta with a large force iB support of the Awazim, is also not true in my opinion, nor is it confirmed from any reliable sourceo- 7o It will be seen from the above that the insurgents under al-Duwish have only one hostile force at all threat ening them. This is the Awazinu These latter are already in a dengerously exposed position and may oe attacked any moment by the combined Mutair and Ajman* As a matter of fact, it is rumoured that they have been recalled from their forward position by direct orders from Bin Saud f ^nd may retire any day now® Their trouble is tnat lurtlier _ south grazing and water is bad. ^3 far ai-Luwish, for the moment he is fatten ing and resting his horses and camels. And as the days are much cooler the latter are going much further afield in search of grazing than they were able to do sometime back, so the difficulty of grass no longer exists, Ai-Duwish may spring up on the Awazim any day now and eliminate Lhem from the contest, personally I think he wi±l sooner, though Shaikh Ahmad states they, the Awazim, have arranged to go over to him as soon as ordered, oust as the Braih did. They are merely awaiting the signal.

Sir, Z I' y r In reply to your demi-official v loth September iyidy. Your question is indeed a dif ficult one and has engaged my attention for sometime past, I have also discussed the possibility on several occasions with Eis Excellency the Ruler, who finds it equally difficult of solution. In the first place, Bin Saud would appear to have been too astute for us once more. He must have imown when he asked that refugee rebels should be kept out of • Iraq, and Kuwait territories, that women and children would accompany such rebels to the pro portion of 4 to x; ^e therefore may be said to have deliberately deceived His Majesty's Grovernment, On the other hand His Majesty^ txovernment obviously understood by the term 'rebels' and 'refugee forces', that fighting formations were meant 9 and they conse quently agreed to keep these out by air action. It is unconceivable, I think, that His Majesty^ G-overnment would have promised to bomb large numbers of non-com batants to please Bin Saud if they had known the tmie facts.-2- - As I understand tilings nere and the shaildi agrees with, this view, tne forces in rebellion against Bin Saud will never send their women and camels alone across the border, and remain fighting themselves till tne lasto This might be expected in the case of civilized persons but not of Bedouins# The Bedouin notoriously fights twice as well,if he has his women and children with himo The latter give him great moral encouragement^so much is th^ so that their leaders themselves would never agree to the move, let alone the rank and fiie ft we may rule all therefore a cross ing of the frontier en masse by women children a4.one a What happened at subaihiyeh the other day was in no case a running away or attempt to take refuge. It was a question only of water and grazing shortage in fact a typical 'try on' or bluff, as was seen the manfolk followed the women at once# If there is going to be any crossing of the border I am convinced it will be by all the Akhwan forces together, either as the result of immediate severe pressure or as the result of a decisive beating in the field# 4 e just as Bin Saud deceived us into giving^, a promise, by implying tnat only fighting men would have to be dealt with, so I thinfc we have a loop-hole of escape and are entitled now to say to him 'we understood from you that it was cien we were to bomb and out by force, you never explained to us tnat every fight- ing person would be accompanied by A- or ^ women and v children# Things being as they are, and on the assumption that armed men will be inextricably mixed up with women etc# we have two ways of meting the situation# (a) By civilized methods. (b) By Tribal ditto' 3 ' Under (A) we can say to Bin Saud tliat vie agree to intern a force of rebels only, after forcing tiiem to disamio We can then place the whole force so interned in a selected area, till the end of hostilities and the] negotiate for their surrender and return to their country when the rebellion is finally quashed. If Bin LJaud does not require them back we must settle them in our own territories, an unlikely contingency, Whilst interned we must be responsible that the in ternees are not attacked or molested by the many tribes who owe them a gmdge* Therefore the area they must be placed in should be well away from the frontier and one easily controlled and guarded. If we cannot guarantee the refugees safety in every way vie must not disarm them, 6* Under (b) the tribal rule is as follows. If one tribe fleeing from its enemies takes refuge with another tribe and makes 'Dakhala', the Huler of the country or shaikh of the tribe, whose protect ion is sought is bound to (a) first negotiate with the pursuers for an amicable settlement. (b) Failing that he must mobilize his tribe and defend the fugitives llfr (c) Or if he feels he cannot help in any way he must give due warning to the refugees, and must move himself out of his own territory to a distant i part. In no case can he eject the refugees by force or hand them over to punishment by their enemies. Under the above analogy ^and Bin Saud knows these rules, quite well), Iraq, and Kuwait, even though the Akhv/an refugees have been opposed to them in war previously, cannot refuse them 'dakhala', and having./ 16?) -4- granted 'dakiiaia' they must proceed to negotiate as 'best they can with Bin Saud for their final repatria tion, in no case may they allow the refugees to raid back against their pursuer (in this case Bin Saud) from the Sxsl *. territory where they have made 'Dakhala'» And in no case can any particalar member of tht? refugee party be handed over to aj^easo the wrath of the pursuero it will be seen from the above that (a) the civilized method is really an improvement on the old tribal law, and probably has been evolved from it, vjy own opinion is that we should apply ^a) the civilized method, the problem and insist on the principle of internment® In the case of Kuwait I should transfer the whole force 01 refugees into the rectangle east of the Safwan Jahara road (i,,e» that bounded by Um Qasr ; Safwan, Jahara,Sabiya), The leaders such as Duwish, Ibn Hathlain, Ion Mashur oic, &amp;c« , I should place on Falaika Island out of iaarmsway and as hostages for the good Dehaviour 01 their followers• As the Shaikh of Kuwait could not protect them from serious raids, I should not disarm the^ internees, Bubiyan Island wouxd have been an ideal spot for them, had thetc been water, but there is not. In the case of 'Iraq.* I should transfer the refugees en bloc across the river Euphrates, and place them in the area enclosed by the Shatw MsXxxfc ai-K^r and Hor Hussainiyeh on the north and l east the Diwaniyeh-Kuwaitha-Samawa railroad on the North west, and by the Euphrates on the South as far as ai Bat ha. This area has plenty of water and grazing in it and for once in a while the Dhafir could be 'prevented from going there in the summer. In the case of 1 Iraq, also, I should not attempt a disarmamen^as to let the refugees protect themselves would be better than for us to have to protect them. Their insurgent leaders could 'be kept at Duwaniyeh or Uasriyeh under surveillance and as hostages« as regards the camels. I suggest tnat both the 1 Iraqt and Kuwait G -overnments give out that no camel claims will he entertained by their own nationals against the refugees until such time as negotiations are complete for returning the refugees to their own countries. In these negotiations a clause could he inserted whereby all camels bearing the tribal marks of either 'Iraq, or Kuwait tribes should be handed over before the tribe ax be allowed to leave and vice versa all camels claimed by the refugees as being in the be hands of 'Iraq, or Kuwait tribes to also/nanded backo % 10« Tlie question of blood guiltiness of botn sides to be officially declared as 'Dnm Dum' i.e. forgotten. It being remembered that the attacks of the Akhwan represented the attacks of Bin Saud's regular troops, and were done to order. 11. Finally should the highly improbable happen, and Bin Saud's armies get between the rebel fighting forces and their encampments, then and then only, may we expect to see an influx of ^non -combatants with their camels across the border 0 Should this occur, we may take it for granted Kuwait will be selected,as the rebels not only are in the immediate proximity now but both the Ajman and uutair as well as Rashaida, look upon the Shaikh of Kuwait as their old overlord, and one must likely to be able to protect thenio In sucn an event I advocate their all beingtaken charge of by Kuwait and. placed round Jahara area and on tlie coast north, of the bay of Kuwait, 12.

Many thanks for vour peraonal letter of the 4th September which arrived this morning.

With regard to Dickson, I feel that his honour has been in no way jeopardized by planes apne^rinr ( to see that his orders were carried out). It was of the utmost importance for us to know at once what Da. ish was doing in view of the reinforcements required at that time in Palestine. I think it dangerous that Dickson should promise anything to these people with regard to aircraft, and I feel that the arrival of aircraft at that time, 24 hours after he had been told to go, will have a first class effect. 3. V.ith regard to the future, we will, of course, on everv possible occasion wire Dickson beforehand. The real solution of ^he problem to my mind is to have a S.S.O. with wireless at Koweit whenever the situation there becomes clouded, exactly in the sa^ie wav as we have in o + her parts of 'Iraq at the Administrative inspectors' Headquar + ers; it works very smoothly and the interchange of communication is all to the good. 4. With regard to Dickson's grievance that the planes went off without waiting for him, under the circumstances it was perhaps just as well although no one in the squadron had any idea that Dickson was coming out or thev naturally would have waited for him; that ii the true explanation. / 5\y. t'age 2 . 5 # With regard to your sending a complaint to the TT i gh Gomrrigs ioner, I think this was quite in order.

(1) This refer* to the visit paid to Kuwait by Farhan Ibn Mashur at the beginning of i ? iay. The Shaikh of Kuwait visited him at Jahra but subsequently, at the instance of tbe .Political Agent, ordered him to quit Kuwait territory. He complied on 14th May. I have no information asjto the amount of presents he received or the supplies he purchased, but I will enquire from the Political Agent at Kuwaitr The last com munication I sent to you on the subject was my despatch Ijo . 24, dated the 28th May 1929. J(1-^ /C CtrA, (2; Cru.I liave no information* I halre no information. Azaiyiz son of l «'aisal bin Uawieia accompanied by a hundred men mounted on carieis, arriv ed within ten miles of Kuwait about th% 27th June. He requested permission for the rebels to encamp in Kuwait territory, but at the instance of Colonel Dickson the Shaikh refused the request. The me8sa £e was conveyed to Azaiyiz by Abdulla bin Jabir, CommancLer of the Kuwait forces. Azaiyiz and his Arabs left Kuwait territory on the 30th June. Before his departure Colonel Dickson had An interview with Faisal bin Shiblan, who was bin Dawish 's right-hand man. The last comiaunication made to you on this subject was my letter flo. 30 of the 2nd July 1929. Hizam bin Hithlain and A1 FuqM arrived in the vicinity of Kuwait on Wednesday, the 17tk July, but the Shaikh refused to allow tnea to enter the town. ^hey were interviewed by Colonel 1ickson, who gave them clearly to understand His Ivlajtsty's Government could not treat with men in rebellidn against a friendly ruler, and reiterated the orders that they were to reeeive no supplies from Kuwait. A copy of the Political Agent at Kuwait's report on this subject was sent to you under my despateh Ho. 39 of 6tk August 1929. In this connection please see Colonel Dickson 's Ko •- 3 - Mo, 468 of the 12th August 1929, copy eiucloacd. The Shalkri of ituwalt appears to have received the announcexaent of Faisal bin Dawish^ s access in a note addressed to him by that individual hiia- self. I have already wired to you under ray Ho. 40 of 8th September 1929 to ask permission to inform Bin 3aud that the insurgents who entered Kuwait territory on the 31st August were speedily coiapellec to leave• 3. With regard to the truth of the allegations , of intrigues against King Faisal, the High Commissioner at Baghdad is in a better position to juage; but I will take them serati m giving all the information on record in this Residency. ] I (1) In his telegram Ho. 568 of Ist June, copy of which was sent to you, the -Political Agent at Kuwait reported the arrival of Ubald, His movements appear to be as follows: Arrived in Kuwait on the 30th Kay with letters from Naif al Hindi ibn Humaid (his cousin and ex-Chief of the Ataibah, who fled from Najd about three years ago, and has since been living in Baghdad and working for King Faisal; to v Ibn Mashur and Waif ibn Mithlain. He went to Wafrah, delivered the letters which were said to contain an offer from T aif ibn Humaid to support the rebels against Ibn Saud, and returned to Kuwait on let June with replies to Jiaif ibn Huaaid r —==r - 4 - Humaid, and also a letter from Ibn Maeliur and Ibn Hitlilain to King Faisal, requesting permiaaion to ertcr Iraq territory if attacked by Ibn 3aud. Ubaid ibn Humaid arrived in Jiasrah on 2nd June and proceeded to Baghdad by train the same ni^ht, (2) Ali abu Shuwairibat arrived in Kuwait from Baghdad on lat July and stayed with Shaikli Aiuaad. On 2nd July he visited uoiae of the Hashaiyidah at Diaanah (about eight iniles south of Kuwait), returning to Kuwait the saint day, left Kuwait on the 6th July and proceeded to TVafrah, returning on 8th July, He left Kuwait for Baghdad on 17th July and it is be lieved that his intention was to collect his. family there and return to Kuwait and the nee proceed to join the rebels. He was reported to have gone to Baghdad at the end of August to inviike the High Gomi/iissioner' s assistance through the mediation of King Faisal. It was added that he possessed Faisal bin Dawish # s new signet rifig. (3) Muhamraed al Khudhri arrived in Kuwait on 8th July. He aecoiopanied Ubaid bin Humaid on the 17th July. (4) Ali abu Shuwairibat left Kuwait for Baghdad on 17th July. (5) Shuaifan abu Shajrah aecompanied by three Ajmanis arrived in lanrait ©n 15 th July in company with Mutrak ibn Hajnah who had four companions from the Ataibak tribe. Both rBoth Sliuaifan and MutraJc are refugees from i^ajd vino iiave been livirig In Ba^nclad for the past three years. it was supposed thatjthcy intended to join the rebels but both were in Kuwait up to the fe8th July. The Shaikh of Kuwait has recently requested that the High Commissioner at Baghdad should deny Mutrak bin HaJnah,Ali abu Shuwairibat, Id al Dahainah and some others all fac ilities to visit Kuwait, as he suspects them of intrigues. Ali ibn Khalid abu Shuwairibat, a distant relative of Ali abu r&gt;huwaitibat # arrived in Kuwait on 15th July with two men of the Braih-Mut «ir. He was in Kuwait up to 26th July. I have no in- I'ormation regarding Burhan al Jabali and the other men mentioned. (7). At the end of August Colonel Dickson reported his suspicion that*King Faisal was intriguing with Khan Bahadur Mulla 3aleh, Private Secretary to the Dhaikh of KuwAit. The go-between was said to be Abdul la al iiizfir. The High Com- Missioner at Baghdad was informed under my Mjs. Lelegram lio. 847 of 27th August, Abdulla al Mizfir is known in Kuwait as King Faisal's Confidential Atalbah Secretary. He is in regular telegraphi# communication with an agent named H i ahomed bin Ibrahim ,, which, Colonel Dickson iuspetts, is a pseudonym for Khan Bahadur Ifiulla Saleh. In the middle of August the Shaikh of Kuwait complained to Colonel Dickson ofm - 6 - of King Faisal•s intrigues. Abdul Rahman ^usaiM is a peatl merchant belonging to the well-known Bahrain family. He visited Kuwait by Imperial Airways aeroplane and subsequen ly continued his journey to Bahrain by k motor dhow. (8) I have no information. (9) It is possible that interested messengers may give out stories of help expected from Great Britain. Canards of this sort arc frequent in Arabia. * I am sending a copy of Bin Baud's letter to the Political Agent at Kuwait for report as my informa tion is incomplete.
