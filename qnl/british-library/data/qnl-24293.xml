T* D.O. 457/6-A. Bahrain. August 3, 1935. Dear Cole, With reference to your letter to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad enquiring about the Hedd murder case. The case was tried by the Bahrain Court, myself and Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad augmented by Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad. The two accused were found guilty of murdering the woman and sentenced to death. The case, as usual, was forwarded to Shaikh Hamad for his inspection and con firmation. Shaikh Hamad sent for me and discussed the case and suggested that I should alter the judgment, not because it was incorrect, but because to carry it out would, in his opinion, cause offence to some of the public, especially the Arabs of Hedd, who are always very independent, truculent and conservative. I explained that having given judgment after much consideration I could not now alter it. Shaikh Hamad asked me to discuss the case with Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and Shaikh Rashid bin Mohomed. They came to see me today. In their opinion the judgment was correct and would have been the same in the Shera Court. They said —- 2 - © said they had no remarks to make on the subject of the case itself. Shaikh Abdullah however said that if the sentence was carried out a certain faction of the Arabs would be displeased. The matter now rests with Shaikh Hamad. This is a test case. There have been numerous murders of women by their own relations in the past on the grounds that the women disgraced their families but this is the first time that the murderers have been caught, tried and sentenced. I am sure that the execution of these two men would tend to reduce this type of crime but at the same time I know that a certain class of the community regard such murder as being justifiable. Although the case itself is an inter nal matter, as all the parties are Bahrain subjects, yet the principle involved is one which affects all communities in Bahrain both local and foreign, therefore I think that the matter may be of interest to you. Yours sincerely, Uaptam (i. A. Uo Political Agent, Bahrain. Captain G. A.
