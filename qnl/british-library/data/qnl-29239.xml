Reference Appendix B to the last Intelligence Summary, some short biographical notes of the members of the Azerbaijan Cabinet are given below : 1. Seyyid Jaafar Pishehvari. —Prime Minister. Age 50. A native of Tabriz, but is little known there, having spent most of his life in Tehran and elsewhere. Was imprisoned in Tehran as a Bolshevik in the time of Reza Shah. A prominent member of Tudeh Iran, he has published the Tehian newspaper Azhir for the party. He came to Tabriz in 1944 exclusively for the elections, and his candidature was supported in every possible way by the Russians. His credentials were subsequently rejected by the Majlis. He is supposed to be a careerist rather than a man of firm political convictions. He now appears to have changed his title Mir ” to k ' Seyyid.” • i 2. Dr. Salamullah /aw'd.—Minister of the Interior. Nothing is known except that he is believed to be a Jew from Meshed. 3. Jaafar People’s Army Minister. Nothing is known except that he is a Deputy for Mar and in the ” National Assembly. 4. Dr. Mahtash. —Minister of Agriculture. He^ is a veterinary surgeon formerly in charge of public health arrangements at the Tabriz slaughter house. 5. Muhammad Birya (not Birja).—Minister of Education. Age about 40. He is the chairman of the Workers Union; his appointment to the Ministry of Education is seemingly justified by his reputation as a composer of light verse in Turki. He has shown great energy in organising the workers, but he has no pretensions to anv particular education. 6. Dr. Urangi. —Minister of Health. Nothing is known of him. 7. Ghulam Reza Ilhami. —Minister of Finance. He was formerly head of the Tabriz Municipality and was removed from his post by the Central Government earlier this year for disloyal activities; he has presumably some administrative experience, but is false, wily, hypocritical and a great gambler. 8. Yusuf A zima. —Minister of Justice. He was formerly Public Prosecutor for both districts of Azerbaijan and was likewise discharged by the Central Government a few months ago.' He was notoriously pro-Russian, an ardent Tudeh member and showed his partisanship openly in the Liqvan affair last August. 9. RabVi Kabiri. —Minister of Public Telephones and Roads. He is a native of the Marageh region; said to have been of a wealthy family, but has squandered his patrimony and is now burdened with debts, has been most active in raising the peasants of the south and probably has the blood of several landlords on his hands; he has been in practically absolute control of the Marageh region for several months past. He is a brother-in-law of General Hasan Muqaddam. 10. Reza Rasuli. —^Minister of Commerce and Economics. He is a former municipal employee of Tabriz. xInternal Security. There had t&gt;een some alarms in Azerbaijan* In Kurdistan the situation was quiet. There had been holdups on the Bushire- Shiraz Road and on the Bandar Abbas Kerman Road. Foreign Interests . The Soviet authorities were insisting that no foreigners should enter the Russian occupied zone without passes signed by the Soviet military attache. The Press had been running a campa^ign for the engagement of American Advisers.

Legal. DRAFT regulations have been laid before the Majlis to regularise the establishment of military courts formed under the Military Government Law of 1909-10. There were no such regulations previously in force, and it was not clear what offences were triable by military courts. The principal offences now to be brought within the jurisdiction of such courts are offences against the safety of the Realm, subversive movements against the Constitution (to profess a belief in communism is a specific offence), sabotage, certain breaches of the Press Law, and offences against the anti-hoarding laws. 2. The Government, not content with the powers given to it by the Anti- Hoarding Law, has asked the Majlis for full powers to deal with problems of food distribution. On the 14th June the Majlis approved a single-article Bill which gives the Government full powers to take any necessary measures, in addition to those authorised in the Anti-Hoarding Law, for the acquisition and distribution of food-stuffs. Economic. 3. The press, Parliament and the public are greatly concerned about the question of food for the next twelve months. Unfavourable reports of the harvest reach Tehran from many parts of the country. Serious shortages undoubtedly do exist in some areas, but it was to be expected that local officials and landowners would underestimate their own resources. An even approxi mately accurate estimate of grain available cannot yet be made. The current belief that there is a shortage will encourage even the peasant to hoard his grain. 4. The Government has now fixed the buying price of grain for certain areas, of which the following are examples :— Rials fer ton. Kerman 1,500 Lars 1,600 Khuzestan ... ... ... ... ... 1.650 5. The shortage of motor transport, which is largely due to shortage of tyres, is a problem which is likely to be of increasing complexity. It affects not only the distribution of supplies, but also the ability of the Persian forces to [31 2]'2 a maintain order. Nothing is more likely to provoke disorder than failure to ensure an equitable distribution of supplies. There may be some scope in the development of animal transport, but it will possibly be'found that the greater par o e available animal transport is already employed on essential carriage, fenortage of gram and fodder also limits its possibilities. A ointments — Civil. Senneh Fara j ullah Asef — a Kurdish Deputy of the Majlis—to be Governor of Persian Forces. 7 There is a noticeable improvement in the morale of the Persian Army Desertions are fewer; in the Tehran divisions the men look less victimised and it seems they are being less badly treated by their officers. There is, however, no evidence that the army is, on the whole, more pro-British in its sentiments strength T ^ e J endarm ?t le 18 j* 11 corrupt, badly officered and under strength Service in the gendarmerie is voluntary and its attraction has always lain in the opportunities for blackmail and pickings of various sorts.

Under the amended law men not passed as fit will not be called up. (v) Previously certain categories of breadwinners and sole supporters of incapacitated relations or minors used to serve eight months with the colours and were subsequently drafted for the balance of their military service (sixteen months) to the road guards. Under the amended law such persons shall receive exemption for a year at a time up to five years, after which they will be called up for one year and then reieaseu. (vi) The care of a conscript’s destitute dependants devolves upon the municipal authorities and is a charge against them (vn) The course of training for reserve officers has been reduced from twelve to six months. (vm) The work of provincial conscription committees will be subiect periodical inspection by inspectors from the capital. ' to3 Internal Security. A zerbaijan. H In Western Azerbaijan there have been some alarms. It was locally J^jeved that Shahpur (Dilman) was being threatened by Kurds, and there was ie panic, which was calmed by some unspecified action of the Soviet authorities, ^viixiety was also cieated at IMaku by movements of the Jalali Kurds which, as far as is known, have not yet resulted in any disorder. Kurdistan. 1^- .Tl 1 ® situation is quiet, and if Hama Rashid were removed to and detained in Iraq there would be little cause for anxiety in this area. Fars. 1^' Aftei a month or so of relative security robberies have again occurred on the Bushire-Shiraz road. The offenders are probably Boir Ahmadi tribesmen and possibly malcontents from Dashti. 14. At the meeting of divisional commanders referred to in. Summary No. 23/42, paragraph 6, a plan of action was concerted against the Boir Ahmadi. The plan envisages concerted action against the Boir Ahmadi summer head quarters in the vicinity of Tal Khosrow (D.S. H.39.J) by columns from the Fars Division operating from Baiza (D.S. H.39.Q),' from the Isfahan Division operating from Simarun (D.S. H.39.D), and from the South-Western Division operating from Behbehan (D.S. H.39.I). Kerman. 15. There have been hold-ups of traffic on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road, U.K.C.C. lorries carrying petrol being stopped in one case. They were, however, allowed to proceed after the drivers had been relieved of their cash. Hunger is probably the incentive for these robberies. From Khamir, a small coastal town between Bandar Abbas arid Lingeh, comes the report of a clash between iVmnieh and a gang of robbers. The former suffered defeat, the loss of six rifles and a fine which was levied in return for the release of their commanding officer, who had been captured in the affray. Russian Interests. 16. The Soviet authorities have said that for reasons of security they must insist that no foreigners may enter the Russian-occupied zone without passes signed by the Soviet Military Attache. This applies to British officers in uniform, the Soviet justification being that a British uniform is the most likely disguise for a German spy. Applications for passes have been dealt with very promptlv. 17. Lieutenant-Colonel Masloff, Soviet Military Attache, has been recalled to Russia and has been replaced by Colonel Razin. An Assistant Soviet Military Attache, Major Beliachev, has also been appointed. American Interests. 18. The press has been running a strong campaign in favour of the engage ment of American advisers, particularly for finance and education. America has recently been the subject of many flattering articles. Free French Interests. 19. M. Goddard, the representative in Persia of the Free French National Committee, has been officially recognised by the Persian Government. M. Goddard has been Director of the Archaeological Department of the Persian Government since 1934. 20. Commandant Jouvel has been nominated as military delegate in Persia of the Free French forces and represents General Catroux. Tehran, June 16, 1942.SECRET Notes for Registry.

Economic, THE price of wheat in the Tehran district has been fixed by the Government at 1,800 rials per ton in the close neighbourhood of Tehran and at lesser prices as the distance from Tehran increases. But these prices will hold good until October only. Subsequently to that the price is reduced by 100 rials per ton per month until March 1943, when it is stabilised at Tehran at 1,200 rials per ton. The price of barley has been fixed at three-quarters of the price of wheat. 2. There have been excellent crops in the Russian Zone, in Northern Khorassan, Gilan, Mazanderan and Azerbaijan. Normally these areas have a considerble surplus available for export to less-favoured parts of Persia, but hitherto the Soviet authorities have shown no indication of any intention to allow the removal of any considerable quantities of grain or fodder. It is generally Soviet policy to keep the poor in their zone contented and fed, and their retention of food-stuffs may be as much for this purpose as for their own needs. They do, lin fact, import from Russia all their fodder requirements. Political. 3. The publication of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty has been received well, but without great enthusiasm, in Persia. It may have done something to allay the fears that, if the Allies win the war, Persian Azerbaijan will be incorporated in the Soviet Union. 4. A list and brief description of political parties in Tehran is attached as an Appendix to this Summary. 5. The Shah professes to be much concerned by the situation of the Persian troops recently sent to Rezaieh. The Governor-General and military commander have reported that the troops are practically interned in the town and that they are allowed to train only in areas indicated by the Soviet Military Commander. Their arrival had, it is claimed, restored some of the lost prestige of the Persian Government and had raised hopes in the non-Kurdish population that security would be established. But the invidious position in which they were placed by the Russian authorities had, in the opinion of the Shah, reduced the prestige of the Government to less than it was before.

In Western Azerbaijan, in the area Shahpur (Dilman)-Rezaieh, there is still a lack of security. Peasants are afraid to go afield to. harvest their crops. The military posts that had been established by the Soviet aumorities in villages^ to give confidence to the inhabitants have, according to reports of the Governoij^^ General, been withdrawn. The Persian troops are confined to the town of Rezaieh (see paragraph 5 above). The Persian Government is now asking the Soviet authorities to agree to the posting of mixed detachments for the protection of villages. They fear that small detachments of Persian troops alone would be overwhelmed by the Kurds and believe that the association with them of even a few Russians would deter the Kurds from attacking. Bakhtiari. 8. There are reports of unrest in Bakhtiari, but there does not as yet seem to be much foundation for them. Kermanshah Province. 9. There has been fighting between the Babajani and Guran tribes in the Shahabad district. It appears to be purely ap inter-tribal squabble. 10. The Khalkhani tribe is also said to be restless after the murder of the Sub-Governor of Gilan (West) near Shahabad. Kerman. 11. Insecurity is also reported on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road and a convoy of U.K.C.C. lorries was recently held up and looted by bandits. Bushire and Gulf Ports. 12. The operations in Dashti are progressing favourably. Most of the rebel leaders have submitted, though Ali Ismail is still at large. Persian Forces. 13.

This is much to be regretted, as only in such a mission was there hope of making any substantial improvement in the elimination of corruption and of pro-Axis sentiments. Russian Interests. 16.

Tehran, June 30, 1942. ' V Enclosure. ~ Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the Period June 24-30, 1942. (Secret.) — Persian Affairs. Economic. (See Summary No. 25/42, paragraph 1.) THE Persian Government is becoming more and more anxious lest their wheat policy should be a failure. The current belief that there is a shortage encourages hoarding, partly as an insurance, and partly for sales on the black market, where the rate is double the Government rate. They also realise that the widespread corruption among their subordinate officials handicaps any honest efforts. The alternatives open to the Persian Government is to raise the price of wheat, which would necessitate either subsidising bread, which they say they cannot afford to do, or raising the price of bread, thus arousing a popular clamour which they have not the courage to face. The Government’s idea of an ideal solution is that imports of wheat should continue to arrive and that hoarders should be forced to disgorge their stocks by economic necessity rather than by compulsion by Government. 2. In order that close touch may be maintained with the position regarding the country’s wheat supplies so that estimates can be made of the further economic assistance required in accordance with the terms of the treaty, His Majesty’s Legation has attached officers to the consulates in such numbers as have been considered advisable, for the purpose of assisting in the collection of , the greatest possible quantity of wheat from the districts. These officers will have nonexecutive authority, nor will they interfere in any way with the working 'of arrangements made by the Ministry of Finance. Officers of that Ministry, however, will give them any information that they may require regarding the assessment and collection of wheat in their areas. These officers will tour freely and make any investigations as they may think necessary, and will also visit the collecting depots. Should any avoidance of delivery or other malpractices come to their notice, they will, after such investigations as they may think fit to make, report the matter to the British Legation for the information of the Ministry of Finance. 3. In an endeavour to prevent hoarding and smuggled export to neigh bouring countries, cigarettes in Tehran have been rationed at the rate of per head per day. Currency. 4. The Persian Government, having decided to mint additional coins, has applied to the United States for the purchase of the necessary silver. The American Government is said to have sanctioned the sale, payment for which will be made in dollars. [31—37]3 a r afield. With the exception of five small detachments, the Persian forces are still confined to Rezaieh by the Russians. The Persian Government is pressing the Russians to allow the posting of mixed detachments of Russian and Persian ^roops up to a total of twenty to protect villages in the affected areas. Fars. 13. Ihe Boir Ahmadi are still raiding and are a cause of unrest and anxiety 111 b °fh .Fars and Isfahan provinces. They have a disturbing effect on Bakhtiari and Qashgai and other Kuhgilu tribes. It is fully realised by the Persian authorities that they must he dealt with by force.' (See Summarv No. 24/42, paragraph 14.) Bakhtiari. 14. Nadir Quli Bakhtiari has surrendered and is now in Isfahan. (See Summary No. 21/42, paragraph 13.) British Interests. Transport. lo. Ihe U.K.C.C. is taking over, with effect from the 8th July, the work of the hast Persian Auxiliary I ransport Service in carrying supplies for Russia from Zahedan to Meshed. They are putting 150 lorries on the road at once and are prepared to increase their transport if required. 16. ^ The General Officer Commanding, Tenth Army, arrived by air in Tehran on the 23rd June. On the 24th June, accompanied by the military attache, he went to Tabriz at the invitation of General Melnik, commanding Russian forces in North-West Persia. He travelled to Tabriz and back in a Russian plane. The general officer commanding returned to Tehran on the 27th June. Communications. 17. During the past fortnight there has been more interference with British military telephone lines in the Kermanshah area. Some of the acts, such as causing a short-circuit by binding a loop round two military wires, are clearly sabotage. There have, in addition, been ordinary thefts of wire by villagers. Czechoslovak Interests. 18. General Sergei Ingrs, Minister of National Defence, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Kalla, military attache in London, arrived by air in Tehran on the 24th June. They have proceeded to Russia. Russian Interests. 19. Two parties of entomologists are leaving shortly for locust research work in the south and west. Their routes are as follows :—■ First party : Isfahan-Bushire-Bandar Abbas-Kerman and Zahedan. Second party : Isfahan-Bushire-Ahwaz-Irano-Iraqi frontier. They are working in collaboration with the British Imperial Institute of Entomology. Greek Interests. 20. The Greek Charge d’Affaires has received instructions from his Govern ment to call up for military service all Greek nationals of the 1914-21 classes who are fit for military service. He has been instructed to seek the assistance of the Persian Government in rounding-up any objectors. His task is rendered more difficult by the absence of Greek representation in Persia in the past and the consequent lack of complete registers of his nationals. He has also been instructed to ask the Persian Government to register as Greek subjects all the Dodecanese in Persia, who up till now have been Italian subjects.Polish Interests. 21.

DISCONTENT with the present Cabinet is increasing, the usual charges being nepotism, corruption and incapacity. Rightly or wrongly, Ministers are accused of being deeply involved in hoarding and other plans for profiteering. The supporters of Sayyid Ziaeddin Tabatabai (Personalities : M.A. 286. F.O. 206) are being more active in endeavouring to increase their numbers. Sayyid Ziaeddin has now informed his brother in Tehran that he is willing to return to Persia when the opportunity is considered favourable. He^would want to be assured of the approval of the Shah and of the British and Soviet repre sentatives. Public Opinion. 2. Public opinion has been much affected by the defeats of the British army in Libya, and particularly in military circles the Prime Minister’s state ment that the VIHth Army had generally superiority in numbers has increased the prestige of Rommel and the German army. On the other hand, it has also roused respect for British frankness. Police Regulations. 3. Reference Summary No. 17 /42, paragraph 2.

The Bill for the amendment of the Conscription Law (see Summary No. 24/42, paragraph 10) is now before the Majlis. The principle of conscription has been generally approved by Deputies. Criticism has been directed against the corruption of officers applying the law and against the period of service, particularly as regards conscripts with dependants. [31—731 b ooxk /by w.o.

The Minister for War, during the debate on the Bill for the amendment of the Conscription Law, stated that the annual intake of recruits could not in present circumstances exceed 45,000. 7.

(iv) Sartip Abul Hassan Purzand’s appointment to command 3rd (Azer baijan) Division (see Summary No. 26/42, paragraph 9) has been cancelled, as he is unacceptable to the Russians. Air Force. 9. The units of the Persian air force hitherto located at the Qaleh Morgeh aerodrome are now obliged to find accommodation elsewhere as the aerodrome has been taken over by the Russian air force (see paragraph 11 below). The 1st Regiment of the Persian air force, consisting of— 20 Hawker Hinds, 14 Tiger Moths, 14 Hawker Furies, a total of forty-eight aircraft, has been transferred to Isfahan. The move has been completed. Internal Security. 10. There is little to report : a certain amount of highway robbery and looting of flocks in Ears and Yazd; apprehensions of further Kurdish pillaffino- m Western Azerbaijan; no further developments in Southern Kurdistan and Bakhtiari.3 /-'n British Interests. 11. An agreement has been come to between the Royal Air Force and the Soviet authorities regarding the use of aerodromes in Tehran. The Russians are to have administrative control of the Qaleh Morgeh aerodrome, the British, in ^ conjunction with the Persians, of the aerodromes at Doshan Tappeh and Mehra- bad. All aerodromes may be used by both parties. Russian Interests. 12. General Pavlovsky, reported to be an expert on tropical diseases, lectured lecently at the Tehran University and was subsequently elected an honorary member of the Persian Academy.' 13. The prestige of the Russian army now stands relatively high in Persian pinion. This is due partly to their military achievements, notably to the defence of Sebastopol, which has commanded Persian military admiration, and partly to the generally admirable behaviour of their troops. Better relations are notice able between Persian and Russian officers. Czechoslovak Interests. 14. The Persian Government has recognised the Government of Czecho slovakia.

Tehran, July 14, 1942. 114 Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 28 for the Period July 8-14, 1942. (Secret.) *— Persian Affairs. Political. THE position of the Cabinet grows more shaky and the resignation of the Prime Minister is commonly believed to be imminent. Criticism and discontent are more openly expressed and are concentrated chiefly on the Government’s failure to inspire confidence that they are capable of ensuring the country’s wheat supplies. In the Majlis there is opposition chiefly from the Adalat party (see Appendix to Summary No. 25/42), who are annoyed because they have not secured representation in the Cabinet, The two local candidates for the premiership, Tadayyun (M.A. 288; F.O. 207) and Qawam-es-Sultaneh (M.A. 295; F.O. 213), are very active. 2. There are rumours that certain generals are plotting a coup d'Etat which will establish a military dictatorship with the Shah as a figure-head. These rumours are probably not without foundation, but there is little indication that plans are very far advanced or that the Shah knows of, or could be persuaded to agree to, such a project. He has, however, made remarks that indicate a weakening faith in the virtues of democracy and the liberty of the subject. He continues to associate himself closely with the army, regards himself not only as its constitutional head, but also as in fact its commander-in-chief, and is inclined to sympathise with the generals, who desire to reduce to the minimum control over the army by Government and Parliament. The record of Parliament and Cabinets since the abolition of the dictatorship is sufficient justification for a modification of the Shah’s previous views. Few generals have any faith in Persian politicians. 3. The Government is, indeed, being very ineffective. It has as yet made no use of the full powers given to it by the Majlis to deal with the collection and distribution of food-stuffs. Although pro-Axis and anti-Ally propaganda is very active, it has in no case taken action except under pressure from His Majesty’s Legation. The proclamation issued (see Summary No. 27/42, paragraph 3) seems to have been just eyewash for the Allies, as the Anti-Hoarding Law seems to have been eyewash for the people. Economic. 4. The position of the wheat supplies in the country is still obscure. Not even an approximate estimate has been made of what is available. It is, however, clear that wheat will not voluntarily be surrendered at the prices now being offered by Government. Some pressure is being brought on the Government to free the price of wheat. 5. Some weeks ago in Isfahan an experiment was tried whereby the bakers were permitted to purchase half their requirements of flour in the black market, the other half being allotted from the Government grain stores. The result was a rise of nearly 60 per cent, in the price of bread, but at the same time supplies became plentiful. More recently in Shiraz the market for flour has been freed [32—13] Ua WO fa lew,2 of Government control. There also the previous shortage has given way to an abundance of bread, though the price has nearly doubled. 6. There is much public anxiety regarding the food supplies of the country, which is being aggravated by all those hostile to the Allies and the Government. The Allies are accused of exporting large quantities of food-stuffs without consideration of the needs of the Persian people. Food riots have occurred in Resht. where Russian troops had to intervene to restore order. Over 100 arrests are reported to have been made. Riots may break out in other towns, and they will easily be turned into anti-Ally demonstrations. Pro-Axis Propaganda. 7. German agents and sympathisers are very active. The situation in Egypt and in Russia gives them ample opportunity for rousing anxiety in all those who have in any way supported the Allies. There is naturally a reluctance to take action that is openly anti-German. A ppointments — Civil. 8. Muhammad Agha Diwanbegi (M.A. 79; F.O. 64) to be Ustandar of Khuzistan. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 9. The Persian Government showed some resentment at the migration from Iraq to Persia of some families of the Jaf tribe. This migration used to occur regularly and with little restriction before the days of Reza Shah. He for a time endeavoured to prevent it, but in latter years had allowed it subject to certain restrictions; arms had to be left at the frontier and a grazing tax paid. This year, in the absence of any effective Persian Administration, the Jaf crossed the frontier without permission, and with their arms. The Persian Government addressed a note to the Iraqi Government threatening reprisals against the Jaf, but it is unlikely that they will take any punitive action against the Jaf as long as the latter behave. 10. Hama Rashid still remains near the Iraqi frontier. Iraqi Government pressure, if any has been applied, has as yet failed to induce him to withdraw into Iraq. Khorassan. 11. Baluch raiders held up three East Persia auxiliary transport lorries some 50 miles south of Meshed. Two of these lorries managed to escape, even though one of the drivers was severely wounded. The third lorry failed to escape and the driver was stripped and robbed of all he had. All the drivers were Indians. General. 12. Main roads are moderately safe. There are no serious disturbances, but many minor robberies. British Interests. 13. His Majesty’s on the 13th July. Minister returned to Tehran from the United Kingdom American Interests. 14.

Tehran, July 21, 1942. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 29 for the Period July 15-21, 1942. Persian Affairs. Political. ALTHOUGH the Prime Minister is said to have improved his own position vis-d-vis his critics, opposition to and criticism of him, his Government and its lack of achievement continue. The Prime Minister has invited Tadayyun (M.A. 288, F.O. 207) to join the Cabinet as Minister of Justice in place of Ahi (M.A. 7, F.O. 5), who has been appointed ambassador to Moscow (see Summary No. 25/42, paragraph 6 (i)). He refuses, however, to give up his portfolio. Nor has Tadayyun yet agreed to accept office. A new candidate for the premiership has appeared in Bayat (M.A. 65, F.O. 50), the Vice-President of the Majlis, but, as the law stands, no Deputy can become a Cabinet Minister until three months have elapsed since his resignation from Parliament. 2. It is not yet clear whether the Prime Minister, Soheily, will be forced to resign or whether he will attempt to gain a reprieve by changing members of his Cabinet. Economic. 3. Anxiety about the wheat situation is increasing and the Government is inclined to panic. They appealed to His Majesty’s Legation for an import of 10,000 tons of wheat per month for three months to tide them over the crisis created largely by their own vacillation. They have been promised 5,000 tons, as the situation appeared to be critical. But they have been warned that they will get no more. That, however, does not greatly impress the Government, who continue to tell the people that they are confident that the Allies will implement their promises to give such economic help as is required. 4. As an indication of the weakness of the Government may be cited the shortage of wheat in Ahwaz for daily consumption. The Khuzestan wheat crop is already harvested and the Government stores should be filling up. but a ring of would-be profiteers, headed by the Deputy for Ahwaz, are holding up supplies while pressure is brought on the Government to free the price of wheat from Government control. The Government appears to be unwilling to apply the Anti-Hoarding Law, although there is here a clear case for doing so. There has as yet been no prosecution under that law. Attitude towards the War. 5. The belief grows that the Germans will reach the Caucasus and Persia, the result being a reluctance to be openly identified with a pro-Ally policy, still less with an anti-Axis policy. The tone of the press, however, remains, on the whole, satisfactory. In spite of the experience of other countries, many Persians appear not .to fear a German occupation, some to be ready to welcome it. Existing maladministration and anxiety about food supplies incline some people [32—22] /[ftrpuMclJur k/'ii ^ To? ry r -' ■*. ' th.ey. ' ' \ ■ | INDIA OFFICE i2 to accept the opinion that things could not be much worse under the Germans. All, however, fear Persia becoming a battle-ground. It is hoped that hostilities would be confined to Western Persia, and it is not impossible that in the minds of some Persians, notably some generals, and possibly the Shah, plans are maturing for the eventual establishment of a Government in Isfahan or further East that would come to terms with the Germans. There is, however, as yet little more than surmise to support this theory. ' A ointments: Civil. 6 —(i) Zain-ul-Abedin Qiami to be Farmandar of Kazvin.

(iv) Nasrullah Saifpur Fatimi, Head of Shiraz* Municipality, to be Farmandar of Shiraz. NoTE.--—The officials quoted under (i) and (ii) above are exchanging appointments. Internal Security. Fars. 7. The Qashqai chief, Nasir, and his brother Khosrow have not yet made submission to the Persian Government. Nasir is in the neighbourhood of Firuzabad (Degree sheet H—39.W) with an armed following estimated at several hundred. Frequent unconfirmed reports are received of the presence with him of two or more Germans. He is reported to be apprehensive of an attack by Government troops, but the general officer commanding is also apprehensive of the dangers of such an attack. His brother Khosrow is with part of the tribe in their summer quarters near Samirum (Degree sheet H-39.D-W.5496). in fairly close contact with troops of the Isfahan ^Brigade. Both sides appear to have agreed to observe an indefinite armistice. 8. Meanwhile, there are reports of an intended or existing combination of these Qashqai chiefs with the rebel chiefs of Kuhgalu, notably Abdullah Boirahmadi and Hussein Quli Mamassani. Such a combination has for some time been reported as the aim of German agents. Abdullah Boirahmadi appears to be trying to get himself recognised as their chief by the several sections of the Boir Ahmadi, who rarely manage to avoid quarrelling with each other for long. 9. Although the only tribe in Fars in active rebellion to the Government is the Boir Ahmadi, the situation is not satisfactory. The Persian Government has not yet dared to attempt to impose its authority over the Qashqai and Kuhgalu tribes, and in large parts of Fars there is no Persian administration. These tribes have never been friendly to Great Britain and they are a potential danger, which is, however, not likely to develop seriously unless the military situation deteriorates considerably. Bakhtiari. 10. The Minister for War has recently visited Isfahan and reports that he considers that' the situation in Bakhtiari is satisfactory. .

He addressed them in the presence of the Soviet Consul, reminded them of their duty and exhorted them to be good subjects. The Soviet Consul also advised them to do nothing to disturb the peace. 13. Confidence has not yet been fully restored in Western Azerbaijan. There are still refugees from the towns in the villages^ but they are gradually going back. * ? fU.

Tehran, July 28, 1942. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 30 for the period July 22 to 28, 1942. Persian Affairs. Political. THE situation is deteriorating. The Prime Minister has little authority or prestige left; there are dissensions in the Cabinet; Ahi, the Minister of Justice, is in open revolt and refuses to vacate his seat; Tadayyun is reluctant to accept office. The people are excited by intrigue and propaganda, by rumours of coup d'Etat and new dictatorships, and anxious about food supplies. The Government is too unstable to reach any decision, still less to put it into effect. Economic. 2. No effective steps have yet been taken to secure the wheat supply of the towns. The Government considers, perhaps rightly, that to raise the price to be paid by Government for the wheat that proprietors are bound to sell would be no solution and would merely result in a corresponding rise in the black market. Moreover, the Government maintains that it cannot afford to subsidise bread to the extent that would be required if the price of wheat were raised. On the other hand, the Government has not the courage to use the full powers given to it by the Majlis and to force proprietors to give up their wheat, nor would they find much support in the Majlis for strong measures, many of the members being themselves proprietors. The Anti-Hoarding Law remains a dead letter. 3. In the muddle created by inefficiency, vested interests, greed and cowardice, the food situation for the poor man is likely to become critical. The creation of a Ministry of Food has been discussed, but a horde of additional officials is likely only to make matters worse. The appointment of a Food Board, which might include representatives of the Allies, is now under consideration. 4. The Ministry of Finance publishes the following information : — Rials.

Persian Army. 7. There is much secret intrigue in the army at present. Senior officers are suspicious of each other; some fear pro-German plots, others fear coups d'Etat.

Sarwan Seyyid Ali Khan, Amir Sadri, to be Military Governor of the Khamseh tribes. Internal Security. 9. The prevailing lack of confidence in, and of respect for, the Government, which is generally regarded as a British puppet, combined with a growing belief that the war will reach Persia and anxiety regarding food supplies, all of which provide excellent material for anti-Ally propaganda, are having a disturbing effect on the country. Riots have occurred in Nahavend and Tuisarkhan and are likely to occur in other places as demonstrations against the high prices and scarcity of foodstuffs. The Allies, particularly the British, are blamed; where there is misery feeling is easily aroused against the British and against the corrupt Government which they are popularly supposed to support. The atmosphere generally is favourable for attempts against British interests. Pars. 10. Unconfirmed reports have been received that Nasir Qashgai is making a landing ground near Firuzabad (degree sheet H. 39-W). Endeavour is being made to clear up these reports and those of the presence with him of some Germans. The approaches to Firuzabad are reported to be well guarded by Nasir’s men. 11. The Qashgai tribes, who for a time were moderately well-behaved, are showing an increasing tendency to plunder crops and herds. This may indicate a growing confidence that they can do so with impunity. Other Tribal A reas. 12. There are no new developments in Bakhtiari or Kurdistan. There are reports that in Lurestan the chiefs are forming an anti-Government or anti- British combination. British Interests. 13. The Persian Government shows increasing reluctance to take action even against well-known pro-Axis propagandists or suspected agents. The recent arrest of certain Germans, who were in hiding, owed little to the action of the Persian authorities, many, if not most, of whom are now engaged in protecting rather than exposing friends of Germany. Russian Interests. 14. Russians in Tehran do not conceal their opinion of the gravity of the situation in Russia, but claim that they have grounds for confidence that they will be able to prevent the Germans from gaining any decisive success before the second front in Europe is opened. Russians in Persia appear to have under stood statements made in London after the signing of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty to mean that a second front would be opened this year. 15. The Soviet Consul at Rezaieh has toured the villages in the area Rezaieh-Ushnu, has addressed both villagers and Kurds, reassuring the former and expressing to the latter Soviet disapproval of lawlessness. His Majesty’s Consul in Azerbaijan reports that co-operation between Russians and Persians in the Rezaieh area now appears to be good. Tehran, July 28, 1942. xSfcCRiPT * - / sirJ-c a_ .

THE Government resigned on the 30th July. On the 2nd August the Majlis voted in favour of the premiership being offered to Qavam es Sultaneh, who received fifty-five votes; Soheily, the retiring Prime Minister, being next with twenty-seven votes. 2. Ahmad Qavam, Qavam es Sultaneh (Persia, F.O. 213, M.A. 295), was a very well-known figure in Persian political life until twenty years ago when, on the rise to power of Reza Shah, he withdrew into private life after a period of exile. He has held many portfolios and has had some administrative experience as a governor-general. He had energy, some force of character, cleverness and guile. It remains to be seen how twenty years of absence from political life have affected his character. His selection is a disappointment to the small class of honest young Persians anxious for reform. To them he represents the old school of corrupt politician drawn from the land-owning classes. Incongruously enough, his candidature w'as discreetly supported by the Soviet Embassy. He had many enemies and will inevitably make many more if he genuinely attempts to solve the problems before him. 3. The new Government will find a formidable task in front of it. Its predecessor did little to solve the problem of the country’s food supplies. If it takes the drastic steps that are essential, the new Government will arouse the hostility of the landowners (to which class the new Prime Minister belongs) and of the number of merchants now hoping to profiteer in grain and other food stuffs. If it fails it may be faced with riots that will have to be suppressed by force. Necessary measures to economise and to make the best use of the country’s transport resources will also bring it much unpopularity, while a policy of blatant co-operation with the Allies in such matters as the surrender to British custody of prominent persons suspected of Germanophil sentiments, and the organisation of A.R.P. measures would in the present atmosphere of dislike for the alliance and of the Allies make its position very precarious in the absence of active and more than moral support. Add to these difficulties an army determined to restrict to the minimum Cabinet and parliamentary control, and having at least the passive sympathy of the Shah. 4. the outgoing Prime Minister, in a speech to the Majlis in which he announced his resignation, claimed that during the four and a half months of his tenure of office order had been restored throughout the country recent riots were due to intrigues and not to natural causes. Every effort had ’been made to [32—64] OrpJju? ojl^o (o'' Q+r- flUjuJiJku ! INC2 encourage spring sowings with unprecedentedly successful results. His Govern ment was not to blame for the short showings of the autumn. There were no grounds for anxiety about food supplies. The question of exchange had been settled with the British authorities to the advantage of Persia. Good relations had been maintained with the Allies on the basis of the Tripartite Treaty, and a real collaboration had been achieved with America. 5. 1 here have been tood riots at Burujird and Gulpaigan, resulting damage to Government property and injury to the rioters. There are grounds for suspecting that these riots are instigated by parties hostile to the Government. See also Summary No. 28/42, paragraph 6. b- The trial of Colonel Mukhtari, the head of the police in the later years of Keza Shah s reign, is arousing much interest in Tehran. He, with several associates, is charged with a long list of crimes, including the murder of Modarris, Prince Nusrat ed Dowleh, Sheikh Kazal and other prominent Persians who had incurred the dislike or distrust of Reza Shah. The present Shah is, naturally, considerably interested in the proceedings as it is well known that Mukhtari acted on the orders of his father. Economic. 7. The Minister of Finance recently laid before the Majlis a Bill for the aboiition of the 3 per cent, tax that is now imposed on all produce entering towns and the substitution of the land tax that was previously in force. In theory the measure is sound, but in practice the land tax led to many abuses, was expensive to collect and uncollectable in areas where Government authority was weak, as happened m the past in tribal areas, and as is the case to-day in some areas. The Bill is, as was to be expected, meeting with opposition from the landowners ,, . JNo P/ogress has been made in the matter of the collection of wheat for the feeding of the towns. Rather the landowners and hoarders have strengthened their position ms-a-ms ^ the local authorities, whose natural inclination to do nothing has probably been strengthened by financial inducements from the interested parties, whose object is firstly to persuade the local officials to agree that they have no surplus wheat, and secondly to secure the abolition of price restriction so that they may sell their surplus stocks at hi^h prices on a carefullv managed market. ^ 9. In the course of a speech to the Majlis the late Prime Minister said that from the beginning of the financial year to the 22nd July revenue had been 864 million rials and expenditure 874 million rials.

The Prime Minister summed up his address to the Majlis outlining his programme as follows :— (tt) In foreign policy, to give full consideration to the interests of Peisia, to execute treaties and agreements in force, and, in particular, to co-operate closely with those countries whose interests were closely linked with those of Persia. (5) To improve and maintain security. (c) To ensure supplies of food and drugs for the whole population. Sr* Other points stressed by the Prime Minister during his address were :— The Government would not fail to persist in demanding the delivery of the full quota of food supplies the Allies had promised. It was the intention to set up a Ministry of Food. The rights and liberty of the individual would berespected. [32—65] CiraMs* aM o to:- (Jos-* C =J2 3. The delay in the appointment of the Minister for War may be due to disagreement between the Shah and the Prime Minister as to whether the nominee should be a civilian or a military officer. The Prime Minister is believed strongly to favour the former. It is some years since there has been a civilian Minister for War. In the time of Reza Shah the Minister for War, whether soldier or civilian, counted for little, the Shah issuing all orders concerning the army direct to the Chief of the General Staff. Since the abdication there hm^li been some confusion as to the spheres of responsibility of the Ministry for War and the General Staff. The position has been tending to revert to that existing in Reza Shah’s time, the present Shah issuing orders direct to the Chief of the General Staff without reference to the Ministry for War, even on matters for which the Minister is answerable to the Majlis. This has created dissatisfaction in the Majlis and anxiety lest the army should again become the instrument of an autocratic Shah. It is believed that it is the present Prime Minister’s intention to endeavour to establish Cabinet control over the army and that he has considered taking the portfolio himself. 4. Strong rumours have been current during the past week, which seem to have been circulated by interested persons, that a disturbance amounting, according to rumour, almost to rebellion, was to be created by Assyrians, Armenians and the lower classes. These were said to have been armed and encouraged by the Russians. Military patrols in Tehran were doubled and other precautions taken. It is not clear whether the source of these rumours was Axis agents or Persians who desire to see repressive action taken against the classes who might revolt against the existing corruption in the governing classes. 5. On the 5th August was celebrated the anniversary of the granting of the Constitution. The Shah broadcast a speech in which he extolled the benefits of constitutional government and expressed his devotion to its principles. At the same time he reminded his listeners that constitutional government imposed a heavy responsibility on the individual. Economic. 6. It is proposed to set up a transport board, on which there would be Persian, British and American representatives, for the purpose of controlling and developing Persian civil transport, particularly as regards the rationing and distribution of tyres and petrol and the use of motor transport for purposes not. essential to the economy of the country. f 7. The Anti-Hoarding Department has proclaimed that owners of tyres ^ must declare all their stocks within ten days. Any undeclared tyres or tubes discovered after that date would lead to prosecution of the owner. Only persons approved by the Tyre Distribution Department may hold tyres. All other stocks must be surrendered. 8. The note issue up to the 30th July was 2,400 million rials, and notes in circulation amounted to 2.059,739,960 rials.

Hama Rashid is to be paid for maintaining order in the Baneh area. Bakhtiari. 11. Mr. Harris, Vice-Consul, Isfahan, accompanied by Dr. Griffiths, of the C.M.S. Mission, and the latter’s 12-year-old son, was travelling from Isfahan to Dorud (D.S. 9G, Sq. 07879). From Sehkuneh (D.S. 9G, Sq. P2493) the party appears to have turned aside to see a crashed Soviet aeroplane which disappeared some months ago on a flight from Basra to Tehran with nine passengers and was recently reported to be lying on the slopes of the Ushturnan Kuh (D.S. 9G, Sq. 09768). Information given by a servant who was with the party is that, after visiting the ruins of 'the machine, the party was ambushed on or about the 3rd August by tribesmen. Mr. Harris and Dr. Griffiths killed, and that the son of the latter had disappeared. The tribesmen concerned are reported to be of the Hiwudi section of Lurs. The district is a notoriously dangerous one and is outside the limits of Bakhtiari proper.A zerbaijan. 12. The press publishes a despatch from the Officer Commanding the Persian garrison at Rezaieh, which states that there is now complete calm in the district and requests landowners to return to their villages. Polish Interests. &amp; 13. The first batch of Poles to be evacuated from Russia, which was due at Pahlevi on the 9th August (see Summary No. 31/42, paragraph 17), did not arrive, and is now said to be due on the 11th August. 14.

THE name of Ahmad Adi, Minister of Agriculture, was inadvertently omitted from the list of Cabinet Ministers given in paragraph 1 of last summary. He held the same portfolio in the last Cabinet. 2. The programme of the new Government was approved by the Majlis by 109 votes out of 116. The Cabinet has as yet given no indication of the quality of its performance. 3. It is now confirmed that the delay in appointing the Minister for N\ ar is due to disagreement between the Shah and the Prime Minister regarding the degree of authority over the army that should be exercised by the Minister for War. The Shah, encouraged by the Chief of the General Staff, wishes to maintain a right to issue orders regarding the army direct to the Chief of the General Staff, the concurrence of the Minister for War, if necessary at all, to be an automatic formality. He argues that that is the only way to preserve continuity and to protect the army from the evils that would result if military policy were to be at the mercy of a succession of short-lived Cabinets. The Prime Minister, on the other hand, wishes to establish complete Cabinet control of the army, through the Minister for War, who, he argues, should be a civilian, so that questions of military seniority should not arise as regards the Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff. The Belgian Military Attache has, at the request of the Shah, drawn up a note explaining the relative constitutional positions of the King, the Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff in the army in Belgium. Economic. 4. Estimates of the wheat supplies available are being made by Persian authorities in the provinces. Reports hitherto available indicate that these officials have been persuaded by landowners to state that supplies are little more than sufficient for local needs, and that, consequently, there is little surplus available for sale to Government at the controlled price, for the feeding of towns such as Tehran, for making up local deficits—as for example in Ears, where there is a definite shortage, and for supplying abnormal needs such as large concentrations of labourers, who would normally be fed in their own villages. Apart from the fact that a fairly brisk trade is being carried on in the black market, reports by competent observers w^ere to the effect that the harvests in certain areas, notably Khuzistan and Kermanshah, were such as to produce an appreciable surplus. His Majesty’s Consul-General in Khorassan reports, after a recent tour in the Kuchan-Darajaz area, that harvests there are first class and he is optimistic that Khorassan should have a considerable surplus. It is evident that the greater part of the harvest surplus to the needs of the cultivator, and L n ,2 4^ possibly a good deal of what he should hold for food and seed, has already got into the hands of profiteers and is being concealed from Government with or without the connivance of local officials. There is considerable smuggling into Iraq, where the price of wheat is much higher than in Persia. 5. A separate administration is being formed to control the collection and distribution of grain, the distribution of tea, sugar and piece-goods, the employ- '* ment of transport and the application of the hoarding laws. The staff will be found from the existing staffs of other administrations. The administration wii^Jg?. be independent of all ministries. The Director will apparently not have the status- of a Cabinet Minister, but may be summoned to Cabinet meetings. 6.

Robbers from the Qashgai tribes are being increasingly active. U.K.C.C lorries, which have for some time not been interfered with, have recently been held up on the Shiraz-Bushire road, and in one case the driver was shot dead. So far as is known, the robbers have contented themselves with stripping drivers and carrying off only small portable articles. Bakhtiari. 9. Further reports confirm in general the details given in Summary No. 32, paragraph 11, of the murder of Mr. Harris and Dr. Griffiths. No trace has yet been found of Dr. Griffiths' son. The Hi wadi (or Hivedi) tribe, who are accused of being the assailants, are a sub-section of the Hajivand, a tribe of Bakhtiari origin, but now said to be no longer included in Bakhtiari. A merican A [fairs. 10. The following American advisers have been nominated by the United States Government or suggested as suitable : — General Greely, with Colonel Gillespie as his assistant, as Adviser to the Intendant-General's Department of the War Office. Schwarzkopf, former head of the New Jersey State Police, as adviser for the Gendarmerie. Tinneman as adviser for the Police. Davis, formerly a member of the Milspaugh Mission, as Financial Adviser. Sheridan as Food and Supply Controller. In addition, the United States Government has been invited to send an educational mission. Interested parties have recently been trying to work up opposition to the appointment of American advisers, and derogatory articles have appeared in a paper which is widely believed to have the financial support of the Shah. Enthusiasm for American advisers has rather waned since it has been realised that their appointment will not bring a flood of Lease-Lend supplies to Persia. 11. The Americans are unfortunately highly susceptible to opposition and even irresponsible criticism, and are inclined to adopt the inconsistent attitude that their advisers should not come unless they are going to be universally welcomed. It is, of course, inevitable that they should be opposed by the upholders of those abuses which the advisers are required to reform. 1 Russian Affair's. 12. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports a change in the previous very friendly attitude of local Russian officials, civil and military. The “ second front” is frequently referred to with some sourness; depression and anxiety3 '—X regarding conditions in the Caucasus are evident. Tales are current, emanating, it is reported, from Armenian soldiers who have been at the front, of hostility between the different races who make up the armies of South Russia, of wholesale desertions and of unrest among the peoples of the Caucasus. Tales of this sort would in any case be spread about by Axis sympathisers, and they may have no better foundation than that. In Tehran, Russian officials remain as friendly as before, but here, too, depression and anxiety are sometimes noticeable. t !3. For a time the Soviet officials in Tabriz appeared to be in some doubt ether American supplies should continue to be despatched to the Caucasus, but on the 13th August His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reported that his American colleague, after a visit to Julfa, had ascertained that supplies were being sent north again via Baku to Petrovsk and thence by a new road along the Caspian shore to Astrakhan. The completion of this road lacks confirmation here. The American Consul had formed the impression that the Russians might be contemplating the possibility of having to.withdraw eastwards along the southern shore of the Caspian. This possibility has been discussed by American officers for some time. 14. Supplies for Russia via the Zahidan-Meshed route are now being carried by U.K.C.C. lorries as far as Kuchan owing to shortage of Russian transport. . 15. A Polish source recently arrived from Krasnovodak reported the movement of horsed cavalry from Krasnovodak to Baku, and a further movement of troops is reported from a South Caspian port in Persia to Baku. 16. M. Smirnoff, Soviet Ambassador in Tehran, has gone to Moscow on leave. Polish A if airs. 17. The evacuation of Poles from Russia has been in progress during the past week. Up to the 14th August approximately 10,600 military and 7,400 civilian Poles had arrived in Pahlevi, General Anders has not yet arrived. Tehran, August 18, 1942.Notes for Registry. Under Secretary...

Political. CONSEQUENT on Taqizadeh’s having refused the invitation to become Minister of Finance, Bagher Kazimi has been transferred from the Ministry of the Interior to Finance, and Javad Amiri (F.O. 20, M.A. 15) has been appointed Minister of the Interior. The post of Minister for War remains unfilled. The Prime Minister wishes to take it himself, but hesitates to do so while doubtful of the Shah’s approval. The Shah is reported to suspect that his father’s treat ment of the Prime Minister may not have disposed the latter to devoted loyalty to the Royal House. Consequently he views with some apprehension a situation where Qavam es Sultaneh would control the army. 2. Some ten days ago, on the demand of His Majesty’s Minister, a number of Persian subjects suspected of pro-Axis activities were arrested by order of the Prime Minister. Owing to the unwillingness of the Persian Government to agree to the procedure for their interrogation considered essential by the British security authorities, they are still in detention in Tehran. During the past week there has been an almost unanimous outcry by the Tehran press against the illegality of detaining in custody persons against whom no charge has been made. The Allies, of whom iVmerica is always mentioned first, are upbraided for their abandonment of the principles of democracy, of liberty, and of the sanctity of the lawo The Dictator, it is said, has gone, but his methods have been adopted by the Allies. It is clear that the press has been inspired, and it is probable that the inspiration comes from the Government, and perhaps, also, from the enemies of the Government. So much publicity has been given to the matter and so much public feeling aroused that it will be difficult for the Government to yield to British demands and at the same time save its face before the public and Parliament. It may result in the resignation of some Ministers, if not in another Cabinet crisis. Economic. 3. The Government has not yet demonstrated any greater determination in the collection of wheat than its predecessor. But it is early yet to despair. The new Department of Supply has been too recently formed to allow of an appreciation of its strength and zeal. It will need a good measure of both to clean up the corruption prevailing among officials connected with food supplies. 4. The Government has issued a list of supplies classed as essential to the life of the country which it is an offence under the Anti-Hoarding Law to corner or hoard. The list includes cereals, peas and beans, potatoes and onions tinned provisions, oils and fats and their products, sugar, fuel, matches dried fruits • / .idtF,942 [33 T 35] [India (* -and nuts, motor vehicles, tyres and tubes cotton, wool, jute and hemp products, cotton and woollen materials, threads and yarns, paper, dyes, drugs, tobacco. Currency Situation,. 5. A crisis developed last week when the Persian Government declined to accept further deliveries of sterling on the grounds that they were short of rials. They also complained that they had not, as yet, received any benefit from the gold conversion clause of the Financial Agreement of May 1942. Of the 700 million rials additional note issue authorised last March, 400 million rials was put into circulation, but \the Government did not specifically take up the 300 million rials credit author\$ed for internal purchases. The shortage there fore is due to the failure of the Persian Government to take appropriate action. Pressure has been brought to bear on them and they have now agreed to release a substantial amount of currency, sufficient to tide over the present difficulties. His Majesty’s Government, on their part, are willing to make available a gold equivalent of £2 million. Attitude towards the War. 6. The Government, officials and the public are much concerned with the question of what is to be done if (most Persians say “ when ”) the Germans reach Persia. Will they treat Persia as an enemy by virtue of the Treaty of Alliance with the Allies? Should the Government remain in Tehran and make the best possible terms with Germany ? What should be the role of the Persian forces, committed as they are by the treaty to maintain internal security? The Alliance is not popular and the Allies increasingly unpopular. Persians hanker for the conditions of the last war when, in spite of being invaded by both sides, Persia was committed to neither.

I n Summary No. 31/42 , paragraph 11, the abolition of the Shah’s Military Cabinet was reported. - It has now been announced that Sarlashkar Amanullah Jahanbani, Minister for War in Soheily’s Cabinet, has been appointed its chief. The Military Cabinet is still non-existent, and it is supposed that the appointment has been made solely to provide a livelihood for the honest and agreeable ex-Minister. 9. There has again been some abusive criticism of the army in the press, and a number of Deputies have presented to the Majlis a Bill which, if it were approved, would reduce the present strength of the army and to a greater degree the strength of the reserves. It has been suggested that the object of this is to reduce the possibility of Persia being drawn into the war. 10. Brigadier Seifullah Shihap, Commandant of the Military Cadet School, was assassinated by a cadet whom he had recently expelled from the school with a number of others. He was one of the best qualified officers in the Persian armv and one of the very few who are genuinely pro-Ally. He was exerting an excellent influence in the cadet vschool, and might in time have produced a greatly improved type of young officer. He served in the South Persia Rifles. .

There is little to report. Minor robberies continue in Ears; there is incipient lawlessness in the Kermanshah area; two minor attacks, probably by Lurs, have been made on the railway near Safid Dasht, about 30 miles south of Dorud. The Persian Ministry for War says that the Kurds of Western Azer- M 1 } an are showing signs of an intention to break out again, but that the Soviet .thorities still confine Persian troops to the town of Rezaieh. The appointment ot two minor Bakhtiari chiefs to positions of authority in Bakhtiari country (see paragraph 7 above) is satisfying to those chiefs, but is not likely to affect greatly the situation in Bakhtiari. Russian A ffairs. 13. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that General Melnik, commanding Soviet forces in North-West Persia, returned from a visit to the Caucasus in confident mood. He scorned any idea of withdrawal from the Caucasus and claimed that the Russian forces there were not only strong enough to hold the Germans but also to throw them back. He did, however, admit some disaffection in the civil population in the Caucasus. 14. The United States li'aison officer with the Polish troops reports consider able movement of anti-tank units from Krasnovodsk to Baku and a flow of civilians evacuated from North Caucasia from Baku eastwards. 15. Two hundred and thirty-four American trucks were recently taken over by the Russians at Tabriz for despatch northwards. 16. One hundred and twenty-nine tons of jute and 20 tons of gunny were recently delivered to the Russians at Meshed, and 371 tons of jute and 65 tons of gunny at Kuchan, all from Nokkundi. The U.K.C.C. are now operating 150 trucks between Zahidan and Kuchan. ” A merican A ffairs. 17. The Prime Minister and the Under-Secretary of State for War have asked the United States Minister whether America would send a military mission to reorganise the Persian army. Polish Interests. 18. General Anders passed through Tehran on his way to Cairo by air. 19. The number of Poles landed in Pahlevi from Russia up to the 24th August is 31,131 military and 17,150 civilian. Medical officers report that there is worse malnutrition among these Poles than among those of the first evacuation. Of the civilian Poles of the first evacuation, 4,536 have now been sent from Tehran to Ahwaz for shipment to East Africa.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 35, 26th August to 1st September, 1942, compiled by the military attache to this legation. 114 Tehran, September 1, 1942. Enclosure. (No. 42/35. Secret.) Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 35 for the Period August 26 to September 1, 1942. Political. Persian A ff airs. , THE Government has agreed to the demand made by His Majesty’s Minister (see S ummary No. 34/4 2. paragraph 2) that the Persian subjects already arrested by the Persian authorities on suspicion of being engaged in anti-Ally or pro-Axis activities should be handed over for interrogation to the custody of British military authorities at Sultanabad. Public agitation about this matter has been suppressed. 2. The Government has issued a proclamation whidh, while calling on the nation to close its ranks in this time of crisis, gives a plain warning to the press and others that activities likely to interfere with the functioning of the machinery of Government or to lead to disorder will be severely repressed in lehran by the strict application of martial law. At the same time the police have distributed leaflets reminding the public of certain articles of the Code of Martial Law' relating to subversive activities against the Constitution or the policy of the established Government and particularly to the law which allows of persons suspected of such activities being detained, even though their guilt has not been proved. . . 3. Simultaneous with this proclamation there was a complete cessation or the press agitation against the arrest and detention of those suspected of pro-Axis 5^.0^ activities (see Summa ry No. 34/42, para graph 2). It seems that the Government, having realised that tnis popular claTliour was not only unlikely to be effective in persuading I^is Majesty’s Minister to withdraw his demand for their surrender, but /whi’cfN was producing a situation which made their surrender more difficult for the Government, decided to find justification in existing laws for the detention without trial of the suspects. 4. It now seems probable that the Prime Minister will himself accept the portfolio of the Ministry for War. Certain regulations have been drawn up to govern the relations between the Chief of the General Staff and the Minister for War, which are likely to be acceptable to both parties. Orders by the Chief of the General Staff regarding organisation, training operations and promotions must be approved and countersigned by the Minister for War before being sub mitted to the Shah. In the event of disagreement, the matter will be referred to the Shah, who will decide whether to over-rule the Chief of the General Staff or accept the resignation of the Minister for War. Economic. 5. The new Minister of Finance has relieved a number of the more notoriously dishonest senior #fficials of the Finance Department of their appoint- ~ £Cd. 1 ^ments. This has slightly raised the stock of the new Government. He has also issued orders to all heads of Finance Ministry Departments in the provinces that the collection of wheat is to have priority over all other work. 6. The Department-General of Food Supply has authorised the purchase of the peasant's share of the grain crop at the official price, half to be paid in cash and half in monopoly goods—sugar, tea, piece-goods and cigarettes, which the peasant is now unable to obtain except at the exorbitant rates of the black market.!^ 7. The time-limit imposed under the Anti-Hoarding Regulations for the declaration of stocks of essential goods (see Summary No. 34/42, paragraph 4) expired on the 25th August. Investigations are said to be now in progress to discover undeclared stocks. The press states that already concealed tyres and wheat have been found. 8. The Press Bureau of His Majesty’s Legation had a statement published in the press to counteract current propaganda, which says that there are large quantities of wheat still to be imported in accordance with the undertaking of the iVllies. The statement points out that the Allies made no promise to import any specified quantity of wheat and that their liability extends no further than the undertaking in article 7 of the Tripartite Treaty of Alliance to give to Persia such economic assistance as they can. The British had, in fact, since August 1941 imported 70,000 tons of wheat and the Russians 23,000 tons. Moreover, neither British troops nor Polish troops or civilians consumed any Persian wheat. All wheat consumed by them was imported. Some wheat was being purchased by British agency for the feeding of Persian labourers employed by the British on roads, railways, &amp;c. The propaganda to the effect that there were still quantities of wheat to be imported by the Allies was encouraged by the Government in the hope that it would induce hoarders to part with their stocks. 9. The Government has announced its intention of introducing bread rationing in Tehran. As a census of the population has first to be taken, there is likely to be some delay. 10. Further reports have been received from Khorassan of the excellent harvests there, particularly in Turbat i Haidari, Gunabad, Kashmar and Kuchan. Undertakings from land-owners in Khorassan for the delivery of grain to Govern ment now amount to 13,351 tons of wheat and 3,669 tons of barley. Transport. 11. His Majesty’s Consul-General in Khorassan gives the following estimate of motor transport resources in Khorassan :— Registered in Meshed, which is the registration centre for all Eastern Iran : 388 cars, 498 lorries and buses. Actually working on roads from Meshed : 45-55 lorries and buses. Laid up owing to lack of tyres, in Meshed or other centres : 300 lorries and buses. Laid up owing to lack of spare parts : 100 lorries and buses. Unrepairable : 45 lorries and buses. No cars are now available for hire in Meshed. Lorry freight rates are :— Zahidan to Meshed : 900 rials per 650 lb. Meshed to Zahidan : 850 rials per 650 lb. ^ ^ A ppoint ments — Civil. 12.

The much-hated Amnieh is to seek popularity under another name and another dress. It will in future be called “ Gendarmerie,” and the detested blue uniform is to be replaced by grey-green. Meanwhile, in the provinces it shows no improvement. It remains oppressive to the weak and cowardly before the strong. Its numbers are being reduced by desertion and lack of recruits to take the place of time-expired men. The rates of pay are insufficient to attract volunteers.41. 1 “ .V* 14. ^Mr. Schwartzkopf, the American Adviser for the Gendarmerie, has arrived. He has, as yet, no executive authority and will for the time being remain in the pay of the American Government. He is a police official, and it is reported that he is known in the American police as the “ Gang Smasher.” Aj^poi n tmen ts—Mili ta ry. 15.—(i) Sartip Mustafa Asa, to the Inspection Department of the General Staff.

(See Summary No. 34/42^ paragraph 12.) 16. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz has also had reports of Kurdish lawlessness in Western Azerbaijan. The Jalili tribe is said to have resumed looting, and in the Mahabad (Sauj Bulagh) district the adherents of the Kurdish ex-Governor, Amir Assad (see Summa ry No. 32/42, paragraph 10), are causing anxiety. Kurdistan. 17. It was reported in Summ ary No. 32/42. paragraph 10, that the Persian Government were subsidising Hama Rashid to keep order in the Baneh area. In order to preserve appearances, Hama Rashid’s brother, Amir Qadir, has been appointed Chief of Amnieh and he will draw pay for a theoretical number of Kurdish gendarmes who are to supply their own arms. (Deserting Persian soldiers supplied these arms to the Kurds in the first instance.) It is also reported that certain other Begzadehs and their relations have been appointed to certain other posts, such as Bakshdar, Director of Customs, Chief of Police, &amp;c. It is improbable that they have any qualifications for these posts, and it seems that this is merely a face-saving method of paying them subsidies to be good. It is extremely unlikely that the Kurdish gendarmerie or the Kurdish Director of Customs will interfere, except to facilitate, with the smuggling of Persian wheat to Iraq. Fars. 18. Security deteriorated during August. There were hold-ups of lorries on the Bushire-Shiraz road, drivers were robbed, tyres removed in one case, but the contents of the lorries left untouched. There has been raiding of crops and sheep by Qashgai and Boir Ahmadi tribesmen; small gendarmerie posts have been disarmed, and the tribes appear to be treating the Government forces with some contempt. Kerman. 19. His Majesty’s Consul reports that action is being taken to improve the situation in the Jask area by compelling the sons of the late Mir Barkat to settle down near old Jask—possibly with a subsidy or some nominal Government appointment—or to put them under effective restraint. These men are believed to have been responsible for much of the recent piracy and slave traffic. Isfahan. 20. There has been a strike of workers in the woollen factories in Isfahan. These factories are making large quantities of blankets for British troops, but the strike seems to have no political significance, but to have been organised solely to secure better conditions for the workers. The strikers have returned to work.• b Russian Affairs. Russian Trooys. 21. A fairly steady withdrawal of troops from Meshed is reported. Over 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry have recently left for Kuchan and presumably further north. The Russian garrison at Meshed is now reported not to exceed 1,000. Caucasus. 22. General Anders, of the Polish army, has information from Polish sources that N.K.V.D. units have been moved via the Transcapsian Railway to Krasnovodsk, and thence to Baku. In his opinion, these troops are for the purpose of suppressing fifth-column movements among the people of the Caucasus and locally enlisted troops. General Anders, like most Poles who have spent some time in Russia, usually takes a gloomy view of the military situation in Russia. 23. His Majesty's Consul-General at Tabriz states 'that reports are locally current that an assembly of Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the Caucasus voted to resist the Germans to the last man. 24. Lieutenant-Colonel A. E. Flodstrom, Swedish Military Attache in Kuibyshev, who left that place on the 28th August, states that, in the opinion of eeitam foreign military attaches, there were not more than ten Russian divisions in the Caucasus. He also reports that the atmosphere in Baku, where he spent one night, was calm, that the Soviet plane in which he flew had a'fighter escort when approaching and leaving Baku, and that German aircraft had%een over Baku reconnoitring and dropping leaflets. Supplies to Russia. 25. During the week ending the 22nd August 195 tons of jute and 26 tons of gunny were handed over to the Russians at Kuchan. Owing to the Indus floods, supplies are not now arriving at Zahidan, where stocks have now been cleared. Polish Affairs. 26. General Anders has returned to Tehran after a visit to Cairo. He intends to locate his headquarters in Tehran for the time being. 27. Up to the 30th August 39,074 military and 20.416 &amp; civilian Poles had arrived at Pahlevi. , Tehran, September 1, 1942.

Tehran, September 8, 1942. Enclosure. Military A ttache’s Intelligence Summary No. 36, for the Period September 2 to 8,. 1942. Persian Affairs. Political. 1. THE Prime Minister has issued a denial of rumours that were being energetically circulated in Tehran to the effect that the Allies had demanded a declaration of war by Persia against Germany and the mobilisation of the Persian army. 2. The Prime Minister has shown some indications of the strong hand. He has suppressed six or seven newspapers, instructed the chief of police that he is no longer to make reports to the Shah, as he has been accustomed to do, has had some hoarders and profiteers arrested, succeeded in limiting the independent powers of the Chief of the General Staff, and aroused some fear among officials. He has surprisingly managed to secure the acceptance by the Cabinet of the British demands for the surrender of suspects (see S ummary No. 35/4:2. para- graph 1) without the resignation of any Ministers. It is regrettable that he is still regarded with some suspicion by the Shah ( see Summary No. 34/42, pa ra- graph 1), and it is the knowledge of that lack of confidence that prevents the Prime Minister from proposing himself as Minister for War. Economic. 3. The following extracts from the annual report of the Customs Adminis tration for the year March 1941-March 1942 are published in the press :— Rials.

(vi) The press reports that the Afghan Government has been asked to aoree to the appointment of Soheily (F.O. 203, M.A. 283) as Persian Ambassado? in Persian Forces. !3. The Under-Secretary of State for War has stated that the Prime Minister has persuaded the Shah to accept, with some reluctance the idea of an American military mission for the Persian army. The argument said to have been used was that this was the most effective step the Persian Government could take to increase the confidence of the Allies in the Persian armv Another amu ment probably used, with both the Shah and the Chief of the General Staff, who has hithei to opposed a foreign mission, was that an American mission mUht procure supplies from America for the Persian army. The Under-Secretary of State for W ar was instructed to prepare an estimate of the number of officers required. He considers that a minimum of three per division, with four at headquarters, is necessary. For the seven divisions now formed the total is twenty-five officers. A formal demand has not yet been presented to the American Government. J3 14. The formation of the Meshed and Turbat-i-Jam Brigades of the 8th (Khorassan) Division is proceeding. Rifles and equipment, officers and non commissioned officers have been recently sent from Tehran. Men who were discharged, or who discharged themselves, after the Russian invasion are being recalled to service. 15. The Persian forces remain heavily handicapped by their almost com plete lack of transport. Operations which are due, or overdue, but are being *;elayed for this reason, are the establishment of Government authority in Pars, the punishment of the tribe responsible for the murders of Messrs. Harris and Griffiths, and measures for the maintenance of security in Khuzestan. Local commanders are reluctant to embark on operations with the knowledge that reinforcements, if required, cannot reach them in reasonable time.

(v) Sartip Mahdavi to be attached to the General Staff for the special purpose of settling overdue Ministry of War accounts. Personality notes on (i), (ii) and (iii) above are attached as an appendix. Internal Security. Khuzestan. 17. Viewed in relation to possibilities, and having regard to the many important undertakings located in that province, security in Khuzestan gives some cause for anxiety. The problems are many and complicated : protection of ships, ports, railway installations and A.I.O.C. plant against sabotage; protection of large dumps of stores against thieving; and general security against possible tribal lawlessness. It would be optimistic to expect the Persian authorities to ensure full security in all these matters. At present, although there is considerable thieving and some raiding by Arabs in the Dizful-Shushtar area, there is no considerable disturbance. The Beni Turuf appear to be prepared to behave provided the Persian military authorities do not attempt to keep them in order. The Persian commander in Khuzestan recently assured them that he was prepared to leave the security of their area to a large extent in their own hands. It is when the Kuhgalu, particularly the Boir Ahmadi, and Qashgai tribes move down to their winter quarters that tribal disturbance is expected. The Persian General Staff propose to send an extra battalion to Behbehan, but, with their other commitments, they are hard put to find this additional battalion. Kerman. 18. In addition to the operations in the Task area reported in Summary -^ 0 - 35 / paragraph 19, the Kerman Division has also commenced operations against the Buchakchi tribe living in the East Sirjan district, who have recently been raiding the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road and elsewhere. This tribe is still led by Hussein Khan, who was a great trouble to the South Persia Rifles. It is reported, but lacks confirmation, that in the first encounter seventy-five tribesmen and twenty-five Persian soldiers were killed. 19. Two columns from the Kerman Division are operating in the Basjakird district (1/million, N.G.-40, Bandar Abbas) and along the Biyaban coast for the suppression of outlaws and the collection of arms. Fars. 20. The situation remains unsatisfactory, although no further serious interference with traffic on the main road has been reported. But neither have the Government forces shown any energy in the pursuit of raiding bands. The garrison at Kamfiruz (1/million, Sheet 11. 39) was recently attacked by a band of Qashgais. It is reported that the attack was driven off. Numerous sensational rumours are current of Qashgai collusion with pro-German elements, abetted, it is said, by Persian officers, and of the acquisition by the Qashgai of numbers of Persian army rifles. These rumours are unconfirmed, and, although many of them are probably being circulated by interested persons, they cannot at present be [34—15] - R ^4 disniissed as entirely baseless. Nasir Qashgai is clearly anxious to avert any action against himself by Persian forces, at least until the tribes have reached their winter quarters around Firuzabad, when he could hope for more support. He has telegraphed to the Prime Minister and the Chief of the General Staff assuring them of his loyalty to Government and promising to come to Tehran in forty days. It is unlikely that he has any such intention, but in forty days the tribes will be around him and the war situation will be clearer. He has also been at some pains recently to convey to the British authorities assurances of hi^ f friendship. Russian Affairs. 21. Hjs Majesty’s Consul-General in Meshed states that the Russian garrison in Meshed now consists of about 1,300 infantry and cavalry and sixty-seven aircraft. 22. On the 16th August fifty lorries arrived in Meshed from Askhabad carrying Russian civilians, including women and children. These lorries returned to Kuchan carrying loads of barley, of which the Russians have recently bought 2,000 tons in Khorassan. 23. During the week ending the 29th August 140 tons of jute and 14 tons of gunnies were delivered to the Russians at Kuchan. 24. In reply to a request addressed by His Majesty’s Legation to the Soviet Embassy for permission for a reconnaissance to be made of the route from Rowanduz to the southern end of Lake Urmia, and thence by barge across the lake to the railway at Sheri f Khaneh, with a view to its being used as an alternative route for supplies to Russia, the Soviet Embassy has answered that ‘ k in existing conditions the flow of supplies to Russia cannot be effected towards the north-west, and that consequently the route proposed would not serve the required purpose.” Supplies are, however, still being sent to Tabriz, and there is as yet no other indication here that it is intended to abandon this route. In fact, the Soviet Vice-Consul in Tabriz stated that American supplies were now being sent to the Caucasian front. Caucasus. 25. A leading Armenian in touch with Soviet officers has informed His Majesty’s Consul-General in Tabriz that his information is that the majority of troops in the Caucasus are from Russia proper, that there are large forces in the Caucasus, and that he believes they are experienced troops. On the other hand, the United States Consul-General in Tabriz—not a reliable authority—has reported that all recruits.called up in the Caucasus since June have been enlisted in units stationed in the Caucasus, that they are unreliable material, and that the defection of a Georgian division was responsible for the success of a German break-through on the Stalingrad front. 26. An officer in the Fighting French Air Force has arrived Tehran on his way to Russia. He says that he is to be followed by a mission of fifteen pilots and forty mechanics who are to join the Soviet Air Force American Affairs. 27. Bills have been laid before the Majlis to authorise the engagement of the Americans, Sheridan and Timmerman, as advisers to the Departments of Food and Police respectively. The former is to receive 12,500 dollars and the latter 8.000 dollars a year. . 28. Schwartzkopf, mentioned in Summary No. 35/42, paragraph 14, as adviser for the gendarmerie, has the rank of coloneL Polish Affairs. 29. 43,416 military and 25,699 civilian Poles had arrived in Pahlevi by the 1st September. It is understood that there are to be no more arrivals. Tehran, Appendix. 1. Sartip Ghulam Ali Ansari. Aged about 45. Promoted to present rank in 1941.

There are indications that the Prime Minister is improving his position in the country. The atmosphere is certainly calmer, and while in the north there is considerable anxiety about the war situation, signs of confidence that there is now an experienced hand at the helm are beginning to be evident. Orders by the Prime Minister prohibiting any public breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan have pleased the uneducated classes, who still value the observance of religious formalities. The suppression of certain newspapers has had a very sobering effect on the remainder. Something also is hoped for from the appointment of a body of inspectors to be attached to the Prime Minister’s pffice, who are to be selected from men of good reputation. They are to investigate complaints made against Ministries, Departments or their staffs, and will have the right to visit all administrations at any time to investigate whether work is being carried out in accordance with the orders of Government. Medical. 2. i he Ministry of Hygiene has decided that there are too many doctors in the capital and too few in the provinces. All doctors in Government employ will in future serve for at least two years in the provinces. An establishment of doctors, pharmacists and midwives has been laid down for the services of the Ministry of Hygiene in the capital, and all those in Government employ surplus to this establishment will be transferred to the provinces. This is a very necessary measure, as the provinces are disgracefully neglected in the matter of medical services. Economic. 3. All provinces except Khorassan and Azerbaijan make serious reports on the wheat situation. In the provinces of Khuzestan and Kermanshah at least the seriousness is not due to lack of wheat but to its having been to a large extent concealed. His Majesty’s Consul-General in Khorassan estimates that the collection of grain for Government in that province will total 27,000 tons of wheat and 8,000 tons of barley. The Soviet Consul-General in Azerbaijan estimates that the province should have 35,000 tons of wheat surplus for export ,to the south. The Governor-General considers that this estimate should be halved. '3 Schwartzkopf, the American adviser to the gendarmerie, an added incentive to improve the force. No steps have yet been taken to bring Nazir Qashgai to heel. Dashti. 13. Ali Ismail of Daiyyir has made nominal submission to the Persian government and is reported to have been given twenty rifles for the maintenance ^ order in his area. Khuzestan. 14. The Persian General Staff are planning somewhat elaborate operations to be based on Behbehan, against the Boir Ahmadi, who, as previously reported' do not make even outward pretence of recognising the authority of the Persian Government. It is too early yet to be sure that operations on the scale proiected will ever take place. ,J Russian Affairs. Keinfoi cements of about 2,000 troops reached Meshed from Semnan S 1 ?! wi The Russian garrison at Meshed is now estimated to be about 3,000, exclusive of air force. 16. The Soviet authorities have recently shown a delicate consideration for 1 ersian susceptibilities. Anything savouring of interference in Persia’s internal aftaiis is in the capital officially tabooed. They have even written polite notes VI? T &gt;ers i ari War Office asking for permission to use certain installations ot which they had already some time previously taken possession. They recentlv summoned Kurdish leaders to Ushnu and, according to the reports of Kurds who were present, warned them against creating disorder and threatened to take their own measures to suppress it. This may indicate increased confidence in the situation on the Turkish frontier as much as a desire to help the Persian Govern ment. Although they still keep Persian troops practically interned in Rezaieh, they have allowed the Persian authorities to import extra rifles to Western Azerbaijan for the purpose of arming an additional force of 400 gendarmes, who are to be recruited for the prevention of smuggling.

The Afghan General, Abdul Ahad Khan, recently passed through Tehran on his way to Angora, allegedly for medical treatment. German Affairs. 19. On the 9th September, at about 1430 hours local time, a German aeroplane dropped leaflets on Pahlevi. The pamphlets were in Azerbaijani Turkish and appear to have been intended for the Caucasian people, who were promised early deliverance and were asked to give no assistance to the nearly- defeated Russian armies. Some commotion was caused in the area. Some local inhabitants showed pleasure; some contractors working for British authorities in connexion with the Polish evacuation demanded immediate payment of their money, but there was little sign of panic. The incident has received no publicity in the Persian press. A report from Russian sources says that the aircraft was forced down near Tiflis on its homeward flight.

THE Prime Minister broadcast to the people of Persia on the anniversary of the Shah’s accession. After some conventionally flattering references to the Shah, he took the opportunity to warn Government servants against corrupt practices; promised to give opportunities of service to educated youth; held out the prospect of an extensive programme of public works, and stated that the measures he was taking to ensure food supplies removed all causes for anxiety. 2. The uncompromising statement of Mr. Wendel Willkie referred to in paragraph 19 below to the effect that only those who gave would get was some thing of a shock to those Persians who hoped to be able to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, to get the benefit of lease-lend without committing them selves to definite anti-Axis action. He had been greeted on his arrival by articles in the press begging him to ensure economic aid to relieve Persia’s distress. Mr. Willkie’s suggestion to the Shah and the Prime Minister that Persia should identify herself more openly with the Allied cause drew the reply that the people must first be prepared. 3. Colonel Mukhtari, head of the Tehran police in the later years of Reza Shah’s reign, has been sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment with hard labour for the instigation of the murder of various political prisoners (see also Summary No. 31/42, paragraph 6). Economic. 4. The preamble to the Bill for an increase in the note issue mentioned in Summary No. 37 /42, paragraph 5, contains the following information :— £ Sterling to the credit of the Persian Government on the 26th May, 1942 ... ... .. ... 3,585,000 Purchases of sterling between the 26th May and the 7th September ... ... ... ... 2,827,188 Total 6,412.188 Sterling credits on the 7th September ... ... 2,757,812 The difference has been used to finance purchases of goods in the British Empire and the United States.

Liesan Sepehr (Liesan ul Mulk), to be Civil Governor of Tehran. Persian Forces. 8. General Greely (see Summary No. 31/42, paragraph 16), is not returning to Tehran. He is being replaced by General Ridley, who is said to be an able and well-qualified officer. The question of an American Mission for the reorganisation of the Persian Army will remain in suspense until he arrives in Persia and reports to the United States Government. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 9. An observer, who travelled in August through Eastern Azerbaijan, reports that the Persian forces have established a fair degree of order in that part of the province and have collected a number of rifles from the Shahsevan, Khalkhal and Qaradaghi tribes. Many tribal leaders have been arrested. The Russian military authorities have given their moral support to the Persian troops. There are Persian garrisons at Ardebil, Sarab, Khiev, Ahar and Herau. 10. In Western Azerbaijan His Majesty’s Consul-General reports increasing lawlessness and arrogance on the part of the Kurds, including the raiding of two more villages by the Jalali. Intertribal feuds have led to incidents, notably at Mahabad and Miandoab. Kurdistan. H His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah reports general insecurity and unrest in areas away from the main roads. Pars. 12. The Governor-General (and G.O.C.) of Ears is now in Tehran to discuss with the Government the measures that should be taken to prevent a further deterioration of the situation in Ears. The Qashgai tribes will soon be on the move from their summer to their winter quarters, and if the submission of Nasir Qashgai has not been secured before the tribes reach their winter quarters he is likely to secure considerably more support, and a considerable military opeiation might then be required to establish Government authority over the tribes. Unless that authority is established security in Ears will be at the mercy of the tribes. Having regard to the numerous reports of German . influence in the Qashgai this is not a happy situation. Russian Affairs. 13. General Melnik has vacated the command of Russian forces in North- West Persia and is going to the Caucasus. He is succeeded by Colonel Volkevitch but it is understood that a more senior officer might be sent later. Certain cavalrv units, including a regiment from Kazvin, another from the Kinjan-Mianeh area and one or more from areas further north, are moving towards the Caucasus 14. An observer who travelled through Eastern Azerbaijan in August reports that there are Russian garrisons at Ardebil, Persian Astara, Khiev Sarah and Ahar, and that there are landing grounds west of Khiev, south-west of Ardebil and south-east of Sarab, but that they have not recently been used except the one at Ardebil. ' ’ 1 io The report in Summary No 37/42, paragraph 16, that the Russians had warned the Km os that thev would take measures themselves to suppress disorder is not confirmed from Persian sources. Reports that have reached the Persian Government are to the effect that Kurdish leaders were asked to swear to support the Soviet authorities and to form a united organisation to £tand together 13 16. The Russians have asked the Persian authorities to supply 3,000 labourers for work, it is understood, in the Caucasian ports of the Caspian Sea. The Governor-General is taking the opportunity to return to Russia the refugees who have caused much trouble in the Azerbaijan since the occupation. Polish A jf aii'S. 17. Before the evacuation of Poles from Russia was completed the Soviet authorities closed the port of Krasnovodsk to all except their own military traffic. The remaining Poles, believed to be about 2,000, are being evacuated from Askhabad via Bajgiran and Meshed to Tehran. During the fortnight the lst-15th September, 1,000 had been transported from Bajgiran in U.K.C.C. lorries. 18. Colonel Szymanski, commanding the Polish base in Tehran, has been appointed Polish Military Attache in Persia. American Affairs. 19. Mr. Wendel Willkie arrived in Tehran on the 15th September on his way to Russia. In a speech at a dinner given by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs he said that the purpose of his journey was to discover who were the true friends of his country. As it had always been, and always would be in times of vital struggle, those who shared in the common sacrifices would gain the most. His country wished to know who fought with it, who wished to share in the sacrifices for the common cause. 20. Mr. Wendel Willkie took the Shah for the first flight he has made.

Tehran, September 29, 1942. Enclosure. Military A ttache's Intelligence Summary No. 39 for the period September 23 to 29, 1942. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. CERTAIN happenings during the week have done some damage to the credit ot the Prime Minister and his Government. In the first place he was obliged. \ under pressure by His Majesty’s Legation, to issue a denial of a statement made in the preamble to the Bill for the increase of the note issue (see Summary No. 37, paragraph 5) to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had promised to supply 120 tons of silver to the Persian Government. No such promise had been made, and the Prime Minister is now being accused of having deliberately deceived the Majlis with the object of obtaining their consent to the Bill. Public opinion had also been disturbed by certain appointments made by the Prime Minister savouring of partiality. Finally, a storm arose in the Majlis during the discussion of the Bill for the amendment of the Conscription Law. This Bill has been before the Majlis for more than two months (see Summary No. 27, paragraph 5) and, although it has passed its first reading, Deputies continue to propose amendments to every article. The Prime Minister showed impatience and said that if the Bill was not accepted without further discussion he would withdraw it and allow conscription to be applied in accordance with the existing law. Some of the Deputies professed to regard this as an ultimatum inconsistent with their responsibilities as the representatives of the people. The Prime Minister’s supporters remained silent, and he talked of resigning. However, on the 27th September he reappeared in the House, made a conciliatory speech and with drew the Bill, promising to substitute another that would be more in accordance with the sentiments of the Deputies. 2. It is believed that the Prime Minister would willingly dissolve the Majlis. Other members of the Cabinet, however, regard the Majlis as a useful shield behind which to shelter when the Allies make awkward demands. Its delaying tactics are remarkably effective. 3. At the request of the Shah the Prime Minister has accepted the portfolio of the Ministry of War. 4. A Ministry of Food has been formed. It will take over the work of the Depaitment-General of Food Supply, whose formation was reported in Summary No. 33, paragraph 5. 5. An agreement has been made with the Persian Government regarding the conditions in which Persians suspected of pro-Axis activities, whose arrest is demanded by the British Security authorities, are to be interrogated and rl dt o i n/i/'l'”'331 Economic. 6. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that the total under takings by landowners for the delivery of grain to Government amount to 14,050 tons of wheat and 5,800 tons of barley. Of this there has already been delivered 6,200 tons of wheat and 2,100 tons of barley. 3,000 tons of barley have been sold to Russia. 7. In Khuzestan, where the price of wheat has been freed, it has no^ reached the fantastic figure of 8,600 rials per ton, and even at that price wheak is not obtainable. One of the largest landowners of the province, the Rais ut Tujjar of Behbehan, who is believed to be hoarding on a large scale, has been arrested and is to be brought to Tehran. In the Kermanshah Province, where the harvest has been reasonably good, Government officials have failed to collect more than trivial quantities of grain. A appointments — Civil. 8. —(i) Mehdi Farrukh (Motassem es Sultaneh) (F.O. 66, M.A. 85) to be Minister of Food. He was for a short time Minister of the Interior in Soheily’s Cabinet. (ii) Amanullah Ardalan (F.O. 27, M.A. 53) to be Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance. He was Director of the Department-General of Food Supply. Persian Forces. 9. The press report of the annual passing-out ceremony of the Cadet School states that 501 officers were commissioned into the army and twenty-one into the air force. It is the custom in the Persian army to give a name to each batch of newly-commissioned officers. The present batch is to be named “ Shihab ” in memory of General Saifullah Shihab, who was murdered by an ex-cadet (see Summary No. 34, paragraph 10), and its motto is to be “ Devoir.” Many of the officers now commissioned will serve only for a period of one year before passing to the reserve. 10. The Russian authorities have now agreed to the location of a brigade of Persian troops, limited in strength to 1,500, at Tabriz. There are already brigades in Eastern and Western Azerbaijan, so a divisional headquarters will be located at Tabriz to command this the 3rd (Azerbaijan) Division. The Persian General Staff has no brigade available to send to Tabriz and proposes to send staff and cadres and to fill up the ranks by recalling to the colours those conscripts who dispersed to their homes without completing their military service when the Russians invaded x^zerbaijan. The Russians now profess a wish that Persian troops should reach Tabriz without delay and a battalion may be sent as a nucleus. 11. With Russian permission a battalion of Persian troops of the Rezaieh garrison has moved to Khoi to check Kurdish lawlessness. Internal Security. South Persia. 12. The military measures to be taken for the prevention of possible outbreaks of disorder in Pars, Kuh-i-Galu, Khuzestan and Lurestan are still being discussed by the General Staff and the Government. Lack of transport is the consideration most affecting any decisive action. Meanwhile the situation is outwardly fairly quiet. In Pars the Khamseh tribes and some sections of the Qashgai have begun their downward movement. The Boir Ahmadi are fioffiting amongst each other and have had a fight with a section of the Qashquli. ^Some of the Bakhtiari are looting villages. No effective action has yet been taken to punish the tribe responsible for the murder of Messrs. Harris and Griffiths but it is understood that some intrigues are now going on with adjacent tribes to secure the surrender of the murderers. A military operation against the tribe would be quite a serious undertaking for the Persian army, having regard to its present condition and other commitments. A zerbaijan. 13. The Soviet authorities have informed the Persian Government that they are no longer opposed to the disarmament of the Kurds of Western Azerbaijan provided it can be done without creating disturbance. The proviso nullifies the permission.3 Russian Affairs. 14. ihe transfer of General Melnik to the Caucasus (see Summary No. 38, paragraph 13) has been cancelled and he remains in Tabriz in command of Russian troops. 15. A fracas occurred on the 23rd September between some Russian ^soldiers, whose lorry had knocked down and killed an old woman, and a Persian *®towd that gathered round. A true report of what happened is not available, but for some reason the Russian soldiers opened fire, wounding six or seven people. 16. Generally, the reputation of the Russian army in Persia for good discipline stands high, so much so that the following story now current in Tehran, which possibly has no foundation in fact, finds some belief. A Persian peasant complained to a Russian officer that one of his sheep had been carried off by a Russian soldier whom he could identify. One hundred Russian soldiers were paraded, and the peasant pointed to one of them. The officer drew his revolver and shot him, and as the corpse fell to the ground asked the peasant - whether he was satisfied that justice had been done. 17. The sudden change in the Russian attitude from unwillingness to allow Persian troops in Tabriz to insistence on their early despatch (see paragraph 10 above), combined with the withdrawal of their objection to the disarmament of the Kurds (see paragraph 13 above), has created the impression in the Persian General Staff that the Russians are intending to withdraw from Persian Azerbaijan. Certain units have been withdrawn, as reported in Summary No. 38, paragraph 13. A merican / nterests. 18. Mr. Timmerman has arrived in Tehran as Adviser to the Persian Police Force (see Summary No. 33, paragraph 10).

Tehran, October 6, 1942. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 40 for the period September 30 to October 6, 1942. Persian Affairs. Political. THE Government has not fully regained the ground lost last week. Critics are more outspoken. Rumours calculated to undermine public confidence in the Prime Minister are being circulated. Even his correct endeavours to gain the Shah’s confidence are being interpreted as an indication that he has sold himself to the Court. The main problems before the Government are those of food and security, and, closely linked with these, that of transport. Measures initiated by the Government for the solution of these problems have not yet produced results visible to the public. Early results were not to be expected as corruption, disorder and indiscipline in the Administration had spread far during the regime of the previous Government. In spite of criticisms the Prime Minister does still command a good measure of popular support, and if he has as yet no great results to show there is evidence in the administrations of recognition that the Government has now a head and a directing hand. 2. In Tehran public opinion is generally calmer. There is less talk of the early arrival of the Germans, a greater readiness to get on with the work in hand rather than prepare for their arrival. Russian resistance may even have aroused doubts whether the Germans will get here at all. Pro-Axis propaganda is less in evidence. Reports from the provinces indicate in varying degrees the same tendency. 3. The full text of the counsel’s speech for the defence in the trial of Mokhtari, ex-Chief of Police (see Summary No. 31 /42, paragraph 6), has now been published in the press and a translation is attached as an appendix.Q Unlike the counsel defending the other accused, who took the popular line that Reza Shah’s reign was a cruel tyranny, Mokhtari’s counsel undertook a defence of the ex-Shah’s regime, arguing that he did so much good for Persia that a few lives lost in the process were of little importance. The speech is a fair representation of one side of the picture, but of one side only. Economic. 4. The Ministry of Finance has published a correction to the figures of sterling credits that were included in the preamble to the Bill for the increase of the note issue (see Summary No. 38/42, paragraph 4). The corrected figures are :— Sterling to the credit of Persian Government on £ the 26th May, 1942 5,585,000 Purchases, the 26th May to 7th September ... 2,757,812 Expended on purchase of goods ... ... ... 2,083 433 Sterling credits on the 7th September, 1942 ... 6,239.377 „ ^ r: P) Not printed. [35 26jPersian Forces. 5. The Persian Government, after a review of the situation in Khuzestan and of their responsibility for the protection of A.I.O.C. fields and installations, have asked to be allowed to increase their garrison in Khuzestan by one regiment of infantry and one 4-gun battery. The present garrison is limited by agreement with Tentn Army to one regiment of infantry, one regiment of cavalry and one battery. A regiment of infantry consists of three battalions, each of about** 300 rifles, and in all Persian combatant units one-third of the strength consist' of recruits with under six months’ service. Experience has shown that the strength originally fixed is insufficient to ensure security, especially having regard to the immobility imposed by lack of transport on all Persian forces. Moreover, the gendarmerie, whose strength should be over 2,000, does not muster more than 700 owing to the impossibility of getting recruits, the conditions of casual labour employed by British and Americans being better than those in the gendarmerie. 6. The Chief of the General Staff appears to be loyally accepting the newly re-established authority of the Minister for War (the Prime Minister). As has been previously reported, during Reza Shah’s reign and until a week ago the Chief of the General Staff took his orders direct from the Shah, and the Minister for War approved as a formality, if he was consulted at all. Both the present Shah and the Chief of the General Staff agreed very unwillingly to a return to the more constitutional position. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 7. Further reports have been received of the assembly of Kurdish leaders at Ushnu, referred in Summaries Nos. 37/42, paragraph 16, and 38/42, para graph 13. Information obtained by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz confirms the report made to the Persian Government that the Kurds had under taken to be loyal friends of the Russians and to organise themselves for mutual assistance against an aggressor. His Majesty’s Consul-General considers that the aim of the Russians in securing these undertakings, to whidh, according to his information, was added one to loot no more, was to curb Kurdish lawlessness and to bring about a truce among the endlessly warring tribes. But the Persian Government expects quite another result. Hama Rashid of Baneh, who has only recently made an uneasy peace with the Persian Government, visited the Kurdish town of Mahabad shortly after the assembly at Ushnu, and was, according to Persian official sources, royally received and hailed as the “ Chief of the Kurdish tribes.” Russian officers are said to have come to Mahabad to meet him and other Kurdish chiefs, notably Zara Aini Agha of the Mamish, and Bir Agha of the Masgur All these chiefs are reported to have signed a document recognisino• l mar Khan of the Shekak as Supreme Chief of the United Kurds. Hama Rashid seems to have attempted to be the peacemaker between Amir Assad of the ^bukn (see Summary No. 32/42. paragraph 10), Kara Aini Agha and Abdullah of the Mangur. The desire of the Russians to see all Kurds united in friendship to Russia is natural enough, but the Persian Government have good reason to fear that unity among Kurds believing in Russian support will not result in peace for their non-Kurdish neighbours. It is to be feared that there are few amono- Kurdish leaders of to-day with the sense to use the liberty they have gained to show that the tribes left to themselves can be law-abiding people. Khuzestan. 8. Provided they can obtain the transport necessary for the movement and supply of their troops, the Persian Government seems determined to carry out but perhaps in modified form, operations for the interception of the Boir Ahmad i on their downward migration (see Summary No. 37/42, paragraph 14) They propose to send two battalions of infantry from the Tehran divisions to Behbehan at an early date. Fars. 9. Persian garrisons at Kamfiruz, Ardekan and Baiza, on routes usually followed by the tribes, were ordered to hold up the migration of any Qashgai tribes accompanied by armed men. The first clash occurred at Kamfiruz where Khosrow, Nasir Qashgai s brother, attacked Persian troops and was forced to withdraw. The G.O.C. the Fars division (who is now in Tehran) professes himself to be very pleased with the results of this encounter. He says he has3 already received an expression of regret from Nazir Qashgai for his brother s action and a promise that their mother will come to Shiraz to prove their loyalty to Government. It would be unwise to build too much on this action, but it indicates that there may be no truth in the rumours of collusion between the G.O.C. the Ears division and the Qashgai. It also shows that some Persian troops are not afraid to block the path of the Qashgai and reminds the tribes of the existence of the ” rsia £ Government. But even if the normal routes are all successfullv controlled it will not result in the disarmament of the tribes. The armed men will move further east via the Kuh-i-Galu country, where they may come into conflict with the Boir Ahmadi, a contingency hoped for by the Persian authorities. 10. The garrison of Ears is to be increased by one battalion of infantry four tanks and one mountain battery. The battery will remain permanently, the infantry and tanks will return after the occupation of Firuzabad, which is to be undertaken shortly. The occupation of Firuzabad by Government forces may not eliminate Nasir Qashgai, but it will reduce his prestige and enhance that of the Government. Bakhtiari. 11. N The appointment of even the two minor Bakhtiari Khans to positions of influence in their own country which was reported, though incorrectly, in Summary No. 34/42, paragraph 7, has resulted in wails and complaints from the villagers of ( hahar Mahel against their subjection again to the old regime of exaction and oppression that was customary in the days of the older khans. Authorised to confiscate on Government account certain stocks of grain, the two officially recognised khans appear to have done some confiscation on their own account and to have infected other khans with this acquisitive habit. Some of the latter, including the important Shihab es Sultaneh, have been arrested by the G.O.C., the Isfahan division. In Summary No. 34/42 the two khans, Manuchir Assad and Abul Qashim. were incorrectly reported as having been appointed to governorships. These appointments were not sanctioned and the two khans have some indefinite position as agents of the Persian Government in Bakhtiari. Russian Affairs. 12. General Melnik, commanding Soviet forces in North-West Persia, paid a brief visit to Tehran. He said that although he had been anxious about the situation some weeks ago he was now confident that the Russian forces in the Caucasus were adequate. He talked much of the “ Second Front ” and was obviously at a loss to understand why it had not already been opened. He was losing his cavalry from North-West Persia and was receiving some infantry in their place. 13. Supplies to Russia by the Zahedan-Meshed road are still interrupted by floods in Sind. American Affairs. 14. Mr. Sheridan, the Adviser to the Ministry of Food, has arrived in Persia. Tehran, October 6, 1942.2 8. After their initial setback (reported in Summary No. 40/42, paragraph 9) the Qashgai tribes attempted to break through to their winter quarters by other /-v routes. Held at several of these, they were eventually successful at a pass held by a small detachment of cavalry, which is said to have fought well until some of its leaders were wounded, when it submitted to disarmament. The Qashgai— the section concerned is said to have been the Darashuri—carried off sixty rifles and three light machine guns. The course of subsequent operations is not yet known. The General Staff state that three columns have been ordered to act ^ against the offending section. Meanwhile some of the Qashgai flocks and families are being held up by the troops; Nasir Qashgai, who with his brother Khosrow, is within 30 miles or so of Shiraz, has telegraphed to Tehran protesting against the action of the troops, and has requested the Governor of Shiraz to meet him. 9. Whatever the result, it is unlikely that it will be at best more than a token disarmament of the Qashgai. The method of attempting to disarm them seems to have been ill-judged and, desirable though their disarmament is in the interests of security, it was considered inadvisable to urge it on the Persian Government in present circumstances. It seems that something has not gone according to plap. In view of the Governor-General’s repeated insistence that the forces at his command were insufficient to re-establish Government authority in the Eiruzabad area, when the tribes were far away in their summer quarters, it seems rash of him to have provoked a conflict with the whole tribe. Until order is restored it is to be expected that the Shiraz-Bushire road will be unsafe. It may be closed altogether for a time. A zerbaijan. 10. According to Persian official reports, Umar Khan of the Shekak, who as reported in Summary No. 40/42, paragraph 7. had been recognised by certain Kurdish chiefs as the Supreme Chief of the United Kurds, has been touring Kurdish areas with an escort of 150 armed Kurds and has given himself a standard, a red flag bearing crossed daggers and three stars, which is locally taken to be the national flag of Independent Kurdistan. The local Persian commander expressed fears that the situation might get out of hand, as the Kurds were apparently relying on Russian neutrality. The Soviet Ambassador has, however, assured the Persian Government that the Soviet authorities will co-operate to keep order. Russian Affairs. 11. The Russian military authorities state that at the request of the Persians they are placing military posts on certain roads leading to the Turkish and Iraqi frontiers for the purpose of preventing the export of grain. Reports from Tabriz say that posts may be located at Khanah and Mahabad (Sauj Bulagh). 12. The Persian General Staff has information of the arrival of “ large ” forces of Russian infantry at Julfa from the Caucasus, and of the hiring of accommodation for officers at Khoi that would seem to indicate the intended location there of a headquarters staff. Fighting French Affairs. 13. The French National Committee has offered six scholarships, each of 24,000 Syrian francs, for Persian students at medical, law and engineering schools in Beirut.

Tehran, October 20. 1942. o Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 42 /or the Period October 11—20, 1942. Persian Affairs. Political. THE Government is faced with difficulties that at the moment appear to be almost insurmountable. In the first place, Tehran has wheat for only a couple of days, and supplies that have been expected from North Persia for some days past have been stopped by the Russian military authorities. In the second place, the Bill it has laid before the Majlis for a further increase of the note issue has evoked much hostile criticism, and on both these questions public resentment is being aggravated by the enemies of the Government and the Allies. It is very probable that the Bill for the increased note issue would in its present form be rejected by the Majlis if it were put to the vote unless the Government could announce some compensating benefit to offset the inevitable inflation—-a benefit that would have to be provided by the Allies. Feeling is already running high, and if the bread supply is not somehow assured riots may be expected. Ihe position of the Government is undoubtedly very difficult. 2. Opposition to the Government is being worked up by interested persons and by that large irresponsible class always ready to criticise any Government. The Deputies are being particularly unruly; this may be due to their expectation that the present Majlis may be dissolved and to their desire to bring themselves to the notice of their constituents with a view to re-election. The Cabinet itself is by no means united, and there the Prime Minister finds opposition to the strong action which he might favour. He has already informed the Shah that he is too occupied with other problems to be able to devote the necessary time to the Ministry of War, and has asked the Shah to nominate someone else for that port folio. This, however, is not the only reason why he wishes to be relieved of the Ministry for War. He has antagonised the Chief of the General Staff by rather offhand treatment; the latter offered his resignation to the Shah, who refused to accept it, and the Prime Minister is said to have interpreted this as an indication that the Shah would support the Chief of the General Staff’. Relations between the Ministry for War and the General Staff are not happy. Economic. 3. Previous issues of rial notes being practically exhausted, the Government has been obliged to lay before Parliament a Bill to authorise the progressive issue during the period up to the 23rd August, 1943, of notes to the value of 2 milliards of rials. In the preamble to the Bill the Government argued that, since the world price of gold was more than double that at which, according to a law of 1931. the gold reserves of the Persian Government were valued, a further issue of notes was fully justified. As further justification, it said that the Government of India was prepared to sell 120 tons of silver, that the Allies would, as far as was possible, import food-stuffs and other merchandise, and it recalled the fact that 40 per cent, of sterling credits were convertible to gold. The gilding has not made the Bill palatable to the Deputies or the public.. a ./. ... 2 See pt-rG-*} Of 4. In the hope of persuading hoarders to market their stocks, the official ^ price for the purchase of landowners’ surpluses of wheat has been raised from the prevailing rates, which vary from 1,200 to 1,800 rials according to locality, to 3,500 rials per ton for the districts of Tehran, Western Azerbaijan, Lurestan, Isfahan and Shiraz, and to 3,000 rials per ton for the rest of Persia. This price is to apply to past as well as to future deliveries made before the 22nd December. On that date the buying price will be reduced by 20 per cent., and it may be subject to further decreases at the discretion of the Government. The official pri^-' ' of bread, however, is to be maintained at 3-60 rials for 3 kilog. 5. It is too early yet to estimate what the effect will be in the provinces of this increase of price. It has not immediately produced supplies for Tehran, where the stocks for the feeding of the town are almost exhausted. Supplies expected from the Northern Provinces have been held up by the Russian military authorities in spite of assurances by the Soviet Embassy that there was no objection to its transfer to Tehran. The Persian Government was relying on the considerable surpluses available in Khorassan and Azerbaijan to feed Tehran and other deficit areas, and if these do not reach Tehran the situation will be very serious. 6. The consul-general at Meshed reports that the landlords of Khorassan have undertaken to deliver 15,671 tons of wheat to Government, of which 2,470 tons have already been delivered. At Kermanshah some landlords have been arrested for failing to declare their surpluses. 7. The increase of railway charges reported in Summary No. 41/42, paragraph 5, applies to passenger fares only, and not to freight rates. Persian Forces. 8. Reinforcements for the Ears and Khuzestan garrisons have recently been despatched from the Tehran garrison. Two battalions and one mountain battery have been sent to each area. The battalions for Khuzestan will reinforce the garrisons in the Behbehan-Gach Saran area. 9. The half-yearly intake of recruits and discharge of time-expired conscripts is shortly due. There is, however, no transport available to bring the recruits from the centres in which they have been recruited to their units nor to convey discharged soldiers to their own districts. As the budget does not allow of the retention of the soldier due for discharge while the recruit travels from the recruiting centre to his unit on foot, it seems that units will be under strength for some weeks. A yfointments — Military. 10. —(i) Sartip Ibrahim Arfa (M.A. 36) to be Commander of the 2nd (Tehran) Division. (ii) Sarhang Mansur Muzayyan to be Commander of the 8th (Khorassan) Division. (iii) Sarhang Nadir Batmangheli to be Chief of Staff to the 2nd (Tehran) Division. (iv) Sarlashkar Ali Asghar Naqdi (M.A. 196) to be head of Military Tribunals. (v) Sarhang Salar Khosrodad, from Officer-in-Charge of the Ammunition Factory, to be Commander of Gendarmerie in the Province of Ears. (vi) Sartip Mahmud Mirjalali to be Assistant Director of Ordnance Services. Internal Security. Fars. 11. There has been no further fighting in Fars. Nasir Qashgai has again assured the Government (through the Governor of Shiraz, with whom he had an interview) that he is not a rebel, that he desires only peace, that he is trying to restrain the tribes, that he will send his brother and mother to Shiraz, but that he will not come in himself. The Prime Minister states that he has written to Nasir telling him he must come in to Shiraz or Tehran, guaranteeing him security if he does, and also saying that the Qashgai tribes must surrender their arms. There is little hope of any firm action being taken to secure these terms, as the Government is too preoccupied with economic and currency questions and too uncertain of its own position; while the Governor-General (and General Officer Commanding) of Fars, unless pushed by the Government, will prefer compromise and indecision: The result will probably be a continuance of the uneasy truce3 ^ that has prevailed for some months past, possibly with increased robbery on the road. The Farsimadan held up seven trucks between Shiraz and Bushire on the 15th October and robbed the drivers. Azerbaijan. 12. Western Azerbaijan remains unsettled, the centre of disturbance being IJahabad (Sauj Bulagh), where the Kurds are quarrelling with each other. His ^Paiesty s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that responsible Kurdish elements with Russian encouragement are trying to get control. Khuzestan. 13. The arrival in Behbehan of reinforcements of two battalions from Tehran for the reinforcement of the Behbehan-Gach Saran area should help to allay anxiety regarding possible dangers to A.I.O.C. interests from the Kuh-i-Galu tribes when they move down to their winter quarters. Russian Affairs. 14. General Melnik has again left Tabriz, it is said for a command at the front. Colonel Damberg is temporarily commanding troops in North-Western Persia. 15. Russian demands for Persian food supplies are increasing. They have already purchased 25,000 tons of barley and have recently demanded 11,000 tons of potatoes. In spite of the Soviet Ambassador’s assurance that there was no restriction on the removal of wheat from the Soviet zone to other parts of Persia, there seems to be little doubt that the Russian military authorities are preventing the transport of food-stuffs produced in their zone. In view of the shortage in Russia, this is only to be expected. 16. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz has had reports that a number of young soldiers have recently arrived in Persia and that they are training in North-Western Azerbaijan. 17. It is reported from Persian official sources that the Russians appear to be preparing to make a considerable reduction in their garrison in Meshed, and that they are removing barbed-wire fences that they had erected around certain areas occupied by them. This report requires confirmation. A recent estimate of the number of aircraft in Meshed showed that it has been reduced to about forty-seven. Polish Affairs. 18. All Poles have now been evacuated from Pahlevi with the exception of about sixty who are sick in hospital. Tehran, October 20, 1942.Slfito S&gt;vjcL&gt;uft.

Tehran, October '27, 1942. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 43 for the 'period October 21 to 27, 1942. Persian Affairs. 1. HOSTILITY to the Government and to the Allies is being very openly expressed, the Government being criticised for failure to protect Persia’s interests and the Allies being blamed for all Persia’s ills. High and still-rising prices are attributed to heavy buying by the Allies and to their recurring demands for increases in the currency issue. Shortage of food-stuffs is said to be aggravated by heavy consumption by the Allies, by their monopoly of much of the country’s means of transport, and by their deliberate prevention of the removal of grain from the areas in their military occupation. Both the press and the Deputies have shown increasing boldness in scarcely-veiled expressions of hostility, knowing that for once they are really expressing the views of the people. The Majlis is in no mood to support the Government in any measure that favours Allied interests. Axis agents find good material for effective propaganda among an already irritated people. Economic. 2. The Government has not dared to proceed with the Bill it laid before the Majlis for an increase of the note issue by 2,000 million rials owing to the violent opposition of the Majlis. It did, however, succeed in getting passed a Bill for an increased issue of 500 million rials, nominally to finance purchases of food-stuffs, in spite of its having found only two Deputies with courage enough to speak in its support. 3. Public feeling is greatly excited over the recurring increases of currency issues. Propaganda tells them that this is leading to a catastrophic depreciation of the rial, which will result in the financial ruin of Persia and, more immediately, to a rise in prices that will make the cost of living almost prohibitive for the poor man. 4. Tehran has managed to stave off a bread crisis, but it lives from day to day, and there is not even one day’s reserve of wheat in the Government grain store. Kermanshah is in little better state, and local officials are refusing to send to Tehran the wheat on which this town is nornially dependent. The Soviet authorities have promised to facilitate the transport of some quantity of grain from Azerbaijan and Khorassan. But they have also asked for 30,000 tons of rice, 5,000 tons of wheat, and 15,000 tons of barley to be deliv^ed to them. 5. The increase in the official buying price has not yeN brought much additional wheat on the market. Some hoarded stocks have be6n discovered, which temporarily relieved the situation in Tehran, but in spite of x t|ie critical situation and public anxiety, amounting almost to panic, regarding the possibility of famine, there is little indication of serious endeavours to force hoarders and speculators to produce their stocks.

Abdullah Adi Isfandiari to be Farmandar of Kashan. Internal Security. General. 8. As is usual when the Government is being criticised or challenged in Tehran security has deteriorated. The consul-general at Bushire reports increas ing brigandage in Dashtestan and truculence on the parts of the chiefs of Dashti. In the Kermanshah Province villages are suffering from the depredations of robbers, and in Khorassan there has been an outbreak of highway robbery in the vicinity of Meshed. In one case the loot included 600,000 rials intended for the Soviet Consul-General. Fars. 9. The Prime Minister’s note offering terms to Nasir Qashgai (see Summary No. 4.2/£2, paragraph 11) has been delivered, but it is not yet known what effect it had on Nasir. Meanwhile, the Government forces have made no further attempt to interfere with the tribal migration, which is being protected by armed tribes men. The attempt to disarm the Qashgai has been abandoned, and the tribes are reaching their winter quarters unmolested. But the temptation to take advantage of the passivity of the Persian forces has been too much for some of the tribesmen. Russian lorries moving from Bushire to Shiraz were held up, the drivers robbed and one Russian soldier was carried off with his rifle. The soldier has been released, but his rifle remains with the tribe. Another hold-up occurred about 2 miles north of Shiraz, which resulted in a British officer, the engineer in charge of the maintenance of that section of the road, receiving a gunshot wound in the arm. Villages are also suffering. 10. There is considerable intrigue in political circles against any military action being taken against the Qashgai. This is being instigated by anti-British circles and is probably being encouraged by Axis agents. The influence of the former, for what it is worth, will probably be used to persuade the Qashgai to remain quiet for the present. Khuzestan. 11. Two fairly serious robberies have recently occurred on the Behbehan- Gach Saran road. The first, when twenty cases of household goods belonging to a European member of the staff of the A.I.O.C. were carried off, appears to have been normal brigandage, the robbers being alleged to be Boir Ahmadi tribesmen. The second, where three European members of the A.I.O.C. were carried off into the hills by unidentified assailants, appears to have been a put-up job instigated possibly by the Rais ut Tujja, a local magnate who was recently arrested by order of the Central Government on a charge of hoarding grain. It would be to his interest to show that disorders occurred in the absence of his restraining influence. 12. These robberies occurred before the reinforcements of two battalions mentioned in Summary No. 42/42, paragraph 13, had reached Behbehan. Their special duty is to secure the Behbehan-Gach Saran area.With tho 'SliU. tAywcIb/c'' ^ OI THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. ■SECRET.

Persian A ffairs. xr political situation remains much as it was described in Summary MNo. 43/42, paragraph 1, with the Majlis still in critical mood and certain parties working for the overthrow of the Government. The Prime Minister is not, l owever without support. There are many who consider that in present circum stances there is no better candidate, and others who are opposed to change because they believe that nothing can be achieved towards remedying the economic situation without some stability in the Government and some consistency in policy, hrequent changes of Government have increased the administrative chaos and strengthened the potential forces of disorder. The belief that no Cabinet, and consequently no policy, will last for long leads to delay and evasion by officials in the execution of its orders. XT- 2 ; T r e Minister has agreed to continue to hold the portfolio of the Ministry for War His relations with the Chief of the General Staff have slightly improved (seejMiminary No. 42/42, paragraph 2). 3. A College of Theology has been opened in the University of Tehran. Economic. .r f rhe increas e in the official buying price of wheat has done little or t thing to improve the situation. Practically no wheat is being offered for sale at that price. Tehran still lives precariously from day to day, uncertain of o-morrow s bread. ^ wheat has yet been allowed to leave the Soviet-occupied zone, but promises of limited amounts are still being made by the Soviet Government. Pr ° V1S10n ° f f ° od is now the main preoccupation of the t? °A The official P rice °f bread has been doubled and it is now 2 rials per kilo*? Even this price is a temptation to villagers to flock into the towns to purchase bread and to hoard their own supplies of wheat or sell them at the hioh prices obtaining on the black market. In many towns in Persia the price of bread fs however, mudh higher than the official price. F ’ [35—57-]- Ki-Cb. PC r'^6.

The Majlis has sanctioned a loan by the National Bank to the Govern ment of 500 million rials for the purchase of food-stuffs. In addition to cereals it is the intention of the Government to purchase stocks of potatoes, peas, beans and lentils to feed the poor in the event of bread shortage. Currency. 8. The Soviet Ambassador has proposed to the Persian Government a financial agreement similar to that in force between tJhe British and Persian Governments, that is, the provision by the Persian Government of rials against 40 per cent, in gold and 60 per cent, in dollars at the fixed rate of exchange of 32 rials to the dollar.

Internal Security. situat i 011 i^ Fars appears to be temporarily settling down, leaving the Government m a weaker position than before as regards Nasir Gashgai and the tribes^ Nasir s reply to the Prime Minister’s letter (see Su mmary N o^42/43 paragraph 11) is to the effect that he is a loyal Persian, that hTag^ees to ht7id back the arms and equipment recently captured from Persian forces fsee Summary -j—^ 4 -/4^ paragraph 8), and that he will send his mother and brother to Shiraz but he declines the invitation to come in himself. The tribes have meanwhile spread out over their winter quarters. It is probable that, provided the Qashgai remam quiet the Government, absorbed in other problems, will be content to let thmgs be Various influences are at work to persuade the Qashgai not to create trouble at present that might provoke the British either to take action against them themselves or to force the Government into action. They are to waft and see what happens in the Caucasus. Meanwhile Nasir grows stronger. Certain sub-tribes notably the Darashuri, who were little inclined to support him have probabiy been driven into h.s oamp by the ill-timed action of the Persian foines ^HMsee Summary No 41/T2. paragraphs 8 and 9), and the Qashgai are now a more united body than they have been for some time. There is little doubt that Nasir is under the influence of pro-Axis and anti-British parties. Azerbaijan. 12. The situation in Western Azerbaijan is giving the Ppr&lt;dnn -f- I much cause for anxiety Although it is likely that the object of recent Russian dealings with the Kurds (s^Summary No. 40y42^par ag 4ph 7) was genuinelv to produce more settled conditions, there seems to be little doubt that it has been3 cons rued by the Kurds as encouragement, if not of Kurdish independence, at east ot a degree of local autonomy in Persia. The intransigence of the Kurds appears to be growing to a degree that is embarrassing to the Russians, who, on e one hand, wish to avoid antagonising the Kurds, and, on the other, do not wish to see them challenge the shadow of Persian Government authority that ^remains in Western Azerbaijan. The Kurds, in the opinion of His Majesty’s ^ponsul-General in Tabriz, are disappointed with the present Russian attitude towards their aspirations. 13. According to Persian official reports, Umar Khan of the Shakak, who, was reported in Summa ry No. 40/42, paragraph 7, was recognised by the eh lets who attended the Ushnu Conference as Supreme Chief of the United Kurds, has been collecting money from villages and exercising other rights of a ruler. He has put the districts of Saqqiz, Baneh, Sardasht and Gurk in the charge of Hama Rashid of Baneh, until recently in rebellion against the Persian Government. The Persian forces appear to be now fairly well established at Saqqiz, but there may be trouble at Sardasht, where the presence of Pishdar Kurds from Iraq is resented by Persian Kurds. Russian Interests. 14. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that during the latter half of October the Russian forces in Meshed, with the exception of the air force, have been almost completely changed. The new troops are mostly European Russians, well armed with automatic rifles and tommy-guns. Some artillery has also arrived. The strength of the garrison is now about 2,000. The number of aircraft has been reduced to about twenty machines. Night flying, which had been in abeyance, is again much in evidence.

THE Government is still being heavily attacked, and anti-Ally, particularly anti-British, feeling grows worse. Press criticism of the Government has now affected its prestige in the provinces, where officials grow increasingly lax in their duties. Tehran seethes with political intrigue, and public opinion is excited over questions of food and currency. 2. There has not yet been time for events in North Africa to have made their full impression on the Persian public, which is at present more concerned with the internal situation than with the war. When, however, the full significance of these events is realised thet^e should be a noticeable improvement in the attitude of the governing classes. The masses will, however, still be mainly affected by fears of famine. Economic. 3. The bread situation in Tehran is still critical. In the absence of any effective action by the Government against hoarders, and they show no inclination to take forcible action, future bread supplies are dependent on wheat being allowed to leave the Russian occupied zone. It is understood that the Soviet authorities have agreed to allow the removal of 7,500 tons over the next month. 4. The increase in the official price of wheat has had only the effect of increasing the price on the black market. It has made no material difference to the amount of wheat being produced for sale. The press is now saying that theie is no hoarding, and that consequently the only way to avoid famine is to import wheat from abroad. 5. An announcement in the press states that 2,000 tons of seed wheat purchased in India will be distributed as follows :— Bushire, Shabankareh, Nayat Daud. Dashtistan Larestan ... Khuzestan Bandar Abbas Kerman T ons. 350 30 1,420 50 150 yo he P ress ^Ports that during the month the 23rd August to the 22nd September, 46,596 goat- and sheep-skins were exported via Khuzestan- 480 cow-skms from Rezaieh; 4.000 kilog. of wool via Khuzestan; 3,073 kiloo- ot leathers via Resht. 4 he pi ice of tobacco has been raised by 20 per cent.

The Cabinet may prefer to resign rather than accept them. 8. The Soviet Embassy has now proposed different terms for a financial agreement with the Persian Government from those reported in Summary No. 44/42, paragraph 8. They now propose that they should be supplied with their requirements in rials against a promise of goods, and that, if the value ofy the goods imported should be less than the rials acquired, the difference should be adjusted by the delivery of gold to Persian representatives in Moscow. internal Security. Fars. 9. A Government commission is to proceed to Fars to negotiate with Nasir Qashgai. This tribute to his importance should greatly increase Nasir’s prestige among the Qashgai and in Fars and make it eventually much more difficult for the Government to re-establish control over the tribes and order in Fars. which is now at the mercy of the Qashgai. It is clear that Nasir’s political supporters in Tehran have been able to influence the Cabinet. Khuzestan. 10. Reinforcements of one battalion of infantry, some cavalry and mountain guns have been sent to Dizful with a view to maintaining order among the Arab tribes who have been marauding in that area. Russian Affairs. 11. The Soviet Embassy has presented to the Persian Government a draft contract for the supply of arms and ammunition to be manufactured in the Persian munition factories. The contract is for 60,000 rifles, 42 million rounds of small-arms ammunition and 30,000 machine pistols to be delivered in periodic quotas during the course of a year. The Soviet Government undertakes to supply the necessary raw materials and additional tools that may be necessary. Twenty-five thousand rifles are to be handed over from stock immediately on the signature of the contract. By agreement with His Majesty’s Government, the Soviet Government has first claim on the products of the Persian munition factories. 12. The Soviet authorities have at last agreed that the Persian Government should be urged to take air-raid precautions in Tehran. Hitherto their attitude has been that the danger of air raid was too remote to warrant alarming the population, and the Persian Government were only too ready to accept this view rather than that of the British authorities. | A merican A fj'airs. 13. A Bill has been laid before the Majlis to authorise the employment of the American. Dr. Millspaugh, as Director-General of Finance.

Tehran, November 17, 1942. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 46 for the Period November 11-17, 1942. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE political situation remains very unstable. The proposals made a week ago for a permanent settlement of the currency question are still under discussion between the Government and representatives of Majlis parties. They involve ratification by the Majlis of the Anglo-Persian Financial Agreement and surrender by the Majlis to the Government of its authority to sanction increased note issues. Unless these conditions are fulfilled, the British and American Governments will give no undertaking to supply Persia’s requirements in wheat. |If the Majlis rejects the proposals, either the Government must resign or the Prime Minister must close the Majlis. The issue is still in doubt, although it seems improbable that even the Persian Majlis could be so irresponsible as to deprive the country of wheat supplies. There is, unfortunately, little hope of the question being treated solely on its own merits by the Prime Minister’s enemies. 2. The change brought about in the military situation by the operations in North Africa has had considerable effect on educated public opinion. Many are now trying to increase their insurances with the Allies. Finance. 3. A Government Bill has been laid before the Majlis revising the existing income tax law. The Bill proposes to tax incomes as follows :— Incomes up to 7,200 rials : Exempt. „ of 7,201-20,000 rials: 1 per cent, on 7,200 rials; 3 per cent, on remainder. „ of 20,001-40,000 rials.: 6 per cent, above 20,000 rials. „ of 40,001-100,000 rials f 10 per cent, above 40,000 rials. ,, of 100,001-300,000 rials : 20 per cent, above 100,000 rials. „ of 300,001-500,000 rials : 30 per cent, above 300,000 rials. „ of 500,001-1,000,000 rials : 40 per cent, above 500,000 rials. ,, of above 1,000,000 rials : 60 per cent. 4. The currency situation is officially stated to be as follows :— Rials. Total notes issued ... ... ... ... 3,200.000.000 In hands of the public ... ... ... ... 2,641,936,000 With National Bank ... ... ... ... 538,063,800 5. The information giv en in Summary No. 45/42, paragraph 9, of the draft financial agreement proposed bv the Soviet Government to the Persian Govern ment was incorrect. The drait agreement states that the State Bank of theU.S.S.R. and the National Bank of Persia shall open accounts with each other in rials, without interest. These accounts to be settled half-yearly, the debtor bank placing at the disposal of the creditor bank gold to the extent of 40 per cent, of the balance due and 60 per cent, in dollar credits. The gold remains deposited with the debtor bank until the end of the war, unless the creditor bank wishes to remove it at its own risk and expense. In effect, the agreement means that the Soviet would obtain whatever Persian currency it needs and supply such goods as it can spare, the difference in value being eventually settled as to 40 per cen^^ in gold and 60 per cent, in dollar credits. Economic. 6. The wheat situation has in no way improved. In the provinces, with the exception of those in the north, amounts collected in Government depots are still rar short of what is required to feed the provincial towns. Provincial officials consequently are concerned to obstruct the removal of wheat from their own provinces to the capital or to other centres. Tehran still lives from day to day, depending on the arrival of supplies from the Russian-occupied zone. 7. As a result of the urgent representations of the American adviser to the Ministry of Food, purchases of certain food-stuffs for civilian Poles have been considerably reduced. Eggs, for example, which were previously purchased at the rate of 26,000 a day, have now been reduced to 2,400 a day. The high livino &gt; of the Polish refugees was not only a constant irritation to hungry Persians, but was also a cause of shortage and high prices of certain commodities. 8. The following are the prices ruling in the Isfahan bazaar :— Wheat Rice, first quality Rice, second quality Barley Peas Potatoes Per ton. Rials. 5.400 10,500 6,000 3,750 7,500 3.600 Communications. 9.

The British authorities in Khuzestan are anxious that the Persian forces, whose arrival at Dizful was reported in Summary No. 45/42, paragraph 10, should not undertake operations against the Arabs for fear that the result mioflit be to disturb Arab labourers employed by the British forces and alter the present situation which, while unwelcome to the villagers and landowners who are suffering from Arab depredations, does not adversely affect British military 1 interests. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ahwaz has been instructed to use his good offices to bring about a settlement that will ensure a cessation of Arab lawlessness with the minimum disturbance of the Arabs.

The Russians have agreed, but have suggested that Persia should also be represented on this commission.

DURING the week the situation led to a serious crisis between the Prime Minister and the Deputies. It centred around the question of a further issue of currency, but was made the occasion for a serious attempt to overturn the Government. After much lobbying the Prime Minister came to the conclusion that business could not be done by normal methods, and that he would challenge the Majlis by asking for full powers in certain matters. The Bill he presented to the Majlis asked for full powers to deal with questions of food, transport, security and the stabilisation of prices. At the same time he presented another Bill which would transfer the authority of the Majlis to sanction new issues of currency to the Currency Commission. The latter Bill was passed after a lengthy session. The approval of the Deputies was probably influenced by the belief that further delay would bring about some forcible action by the Allies, possibly the closing of the Majlis. 2. In his speech introducing the Bill asking for full powers (mentioned in paragraph 1 above), the Prime Minister mentioned the following points : {a) The British had agreed to increase that proportion of the sterling • balances of the Persian Government, as ascertained quarterly, which is convertible into gold from 40 per cent, to 60 per cent. (b) If the pound was later found to be over-valued in terms of rials, there was a hope of securing a readjustment of the rate of exchange. {c) The Allies had agreed to bring 25,000 tons of wheat to Tehran, and, in addition, to import as was found necessary sufficient wheat to make up the deficiency of local supplies until the next harvest. There is likely to be strong opposition to the Bill, and it seems that a j determined effort may be made to turn out the Government. 3. Recent Allied victories have greatly affected public opinion, and, while it cannot be said that anti-British feeling has greatly diminished, there is a noticeable increase of respect .for the Allies. Perhaps from fear of dissolution, certain leaders of Majlis parties are now eager to assert their desire to co-operate with the Allies. Currency. 4. The new Currency Bill, of which a translation is given in an appendix to this Summary, should remove the difficulties hitherto existent in obtaining sufficient rials for British expenditure in Persia and will avert a recurrence of r 36—40j2 the crisis that has arisen at intervals each time that Majlis sanction had to be demanded for further issues of currency—crises that have shaken the Government and aroused' great public excitement. It will not, however, restore public confidence in the currency nor allay fears of continuing inflation. Economic. 5. The wheat situation, particularly as regards the capital, has slightly improved. Supplies are now coming forward in small quantities from the Russian zone, and the Soviet authorities have stated that they now propose to take not more than 5,000 tons of wheat for themselves and that the remainder will be available for Persian consumption. They do insist, however, on having 30,000 tons of rice, but say that they will take rice from the province of Gilan only, the rice of Mazanderan being left for Persian Government needs. A y/pointmentS' — Civil. h- (i) Ismail Bahadur (M.A. 54), Governor of Kashan, to be Governor of Bushire. (ii) Morteza Sarmad, to be Director of the Anti-Hoarding Department. Persian Forces. 7. The position of General Ridley (s ee. Summary No_ .44/42 paragraph 9) still remains indefinite. He has as yet no official position, but is being given facilities to investigate the conditions of the Persian army, and he has already outlined certain proposals for reform. A ppointments — Military. 8. —(i) Sartip Abdullah Hidayet, from Deputy Chief of the General Staff to be Commandant of the Cadets’ School, vice Sartip Ansari. (ii) Sartip Ghulam Ali Ansari (M.A. 28), to be attached to General Ridley. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 9. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that, owing to trouble between the townspeople and the Kurds who now rule the district, the Soviet authorities have agreed to the despatch to Mahabad (Sauj Bulagh) of a battalion of Persian troops and a force of gendarmerie. It is not yet known whether the Persian authorities have the troops available. 10. It is also reported that the Iraqi Pizhdar Kurds have agreed to leave the town of Sardasht on condition that it is not occupied by their enemies, the Mangurs (s ee Summary No. 44/ 42, paragraph 13). Ears. 11. There is evidence that Nasir Qashgai and his brother Khosrow are in considerable perturbation. This is probably due partly to recent Axis defeats and partly to the knowledge of the discovery of the secret aerodrome in Nasir’s territory (s ee Summary A r o. 46/42, para graph 12). Khosrow has arrived in Shiraz, and he is reliably reported as having said that he intends to assure His Majesty’s Consul of his intention to obey the orders of Government. One emissary states that he has quarrelled with Nasir and intends to attach himself to the British. This may be nothing more than a typical Qashgai ruse, but a general inclination to veer away from Nasir may now be expected to be evident amon^ his supporters in Pars and Tehran. The Persian General Staff is still disinclined to undertake operations against him. arguing that it would be unwise to do so unless they had the transport to move reinforcements rapidly from Tehran should the forces in Pars prove insufficient for the task. 12. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire reports that brigandage is becoming more prevalent in Dashtistan, four Persian caravans having recently been robbed near Borasjun and Shahbankareh. The Tangistan and Dashti chiefs are again growing truculent and are showing increasing opposition to the presence of gendarmerie garrisons in their ports.3 Russian A ffairs. 13. The Russian garrison in Meshed is now reported to be about 4,000 and to consist of the following units :— One battalion each of the 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments. 27th Infantry Regiment from Turkestan. One regiment of artillery. A few light tanks. 56th Air Squadron (twenty to twenty-two aircraft). A detachment is reported to have been sent recently to Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. Tehran, November 24, 1942. Appendix. Translation of the Text of the Currency Law passed by the Majlis on November 19, 1942. Article 1. From the date of the passing of this law, authority for the issue of notes is vested in the Note Reserve Control Committee. Article 2. The Director-General of Finances, Dr. Millspaugh, will become a member of the Note Control Reserve Committee after his arrival. A rticle 3. The conditions for the issue of notes, authority for which is vested by this law in the Note Reserve Control Committee, will be fixed by a decree of the Council of Ministers, acting on proposals put forward by the Note Reserve Control Committee. Article 4. Notes which are issued by virtue of this law must possess the following backing : — (a) As to 60 per cent. : gold at the official rate ruling in the international market at the present and / or pounds and dollars convertible into gold. (b) As to 40 per cent. : pounds and dollars guaranteed against depreciation in terms of gold at to-day’s rate. Article 5. • The backing for the notes to the value of 3,500 million rials, authority for the issue of which has been given up till this date, will be on a basis of 60 per cent, gold and silver, valued at the international market rate, and the jewels which were handed over to the National Bank in accordance with the law of the 25th Aban, 1316.* PY % CoUo. 6 ffx^ ! ®..

Political. Persian Affairs. THE relations of the Cabinet with the Majlis remain very strained. The Bill asking for full powers for the Government has not yet entered on the first stage of Majlis procedure—examination by a commission of Deputies. The Majlis is hostile, but the fear of dissolution tempers its hostility with caution. The Shah hesitates to encourage any measures that would give unrestricted powers to the Prime Minister, in whose loyalty to the dynasty he still lacks confidence. In this he is encouraged by the military leaders, who, although they would welcome the silencing of the Majlis criticism of the army, fear an extension of the Prime Minister’s control over the army. Considerable specula tion has been caused by articles in the press, inspired by the Public Relations Bureau of the British Legation, which referred to British support of the Cabinet and disapproval of frequent changes of Cabinet. These have been wrongly interpreted to mean that Qavam-es-Sultaneh will be maintained in power by the British. It is probable that the Prime Minister’s position has been strengthened, but some people hold the opinion that his personal prestige has been diminished. 2. Some attempt was made in political circles in the capital to arouse fears that the British intend to establish Qavam-es-Sultaneh as a dictator, and this has to some extent been successful in arousing strong feelings against him. Even the Shah appears to have been alarmed, and he is showing an increasing tendency to look for support and protection in the army rathe] 1 than in the Government and the Majlis. Economic. 3. Tehran and the provincial towns just manage to avert a bread crisis, and the Prime Minister’s announcement that the Allies have undertaken to import 25.000 tons of wheat within the next few months and to ensure that proved deficiencies of local supply will be made good up to next harvest has done something to allay public fears of famine. There are hopes of an improvement in the flow of supplies into Government stores in most provinces. 4. The following figures relative to the rise in prices are believed to be reliable :— Index of wholesale prices (1936 = 100)— March 1942 283 July 1942 319 Cost-of-living index (1936 = 100)— September 1941 ... 242-6 March 1942 314 July 1942 368 October 1942 ... ... 418 [36—62] f /2 Notes in circulation— March 1942 1,746,000,000 November 1942 nearly 3,000,000.000 5. The results of a census of population and animals in districts included in the jurisdiction of the Governor of Tehran are given in an appendix. Currency. £*■ 6- A statement in Summary No. 47/42. paragraph 4, to the effect that the new Currency Law had not restored public confidence in the rial requires correction. The strength of the backing given to future issues of currency by article 4 of that law has been realised by the public. As a result, the price of gold in Tehran has dropped. Persian Forces. 7. Much discussion is now going on in Persian military circles as to the duties and powers that should be given to an American Military Mission should Arnei ica agree to send one. It has been accepted that the head of the mission would be assistant to the Minister for War and that orders regarding adminis tration and organisation would be issued by the Ministry only with his approval. The Shah and the Chief of the General Staff wish to limit the activities of the mission to the Ministry for War, and in that they would have the support of all coiiupt officers; but it is generally realised that no effective reforms would he achieved unless the American Mission had the right to investigate administra tion in units and formations and to insist on the dismissal of corrupt and inefficient officers. The Shah is anxious to preserve unimpaired his personal influence in, and his right of command over, the army. There is suspicion that he is at present more concerned to foster attachment to his person than to eliminate corruption. Appointments — Military. ^my.—(i) Sarhang Muhammad Taqi Alp, formerly Chief of Staff to Sipahbod Shahbakhte, to be Commander of the 9th (Ardebil) Brigade vice Sarhang Jahanpulad. Gendarmerie. (ii) Sarhang Muhammad Ghaffari to command No. 1 (Tehran) Gendarmerie District. (iii) Sarhang Jawad Mir Fendereski to command No. 7 (Western) Gendar merie District. (iv) Sarhang Baqir Nikandesh to command No. 3 (Khorassan) Gendarmerie District. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 9. General Agevli, the head of the gendarmerie, has now returned from Western Azerbaijan. He went there with Russian approval to investigate the matter of placing gendarmerie posts along the frontier, mainly for the ^purpose of preventing the smuggling of wheat into Turkey and Iraq. The Russians were anxious to put an end to this traffic. General Agevli, however, considers that, in view of the number of hostile and well-armed Kurds along the frontier, small posts of gendaimeiie would be not merely ineffective, but likely to be overcome by the Kurds, and that only a strong military force could cope with the situation. His Majesty’s Consul-General in Azerbaijan considers that the Russians are becoming less opposed to Persian military action against the Kurds, in whom with the improved situation in the Caucasus, they appear to be losing interest' It is unlikely that the Persian army will venture on the serious operations that would be necessary for the disarmament of the Kurds. Kerman shah. 10. General Shahbakhte says that he has given orders for the disarmament of the Kalkhani tribe living in the vicinity of Kasr-i-Shirin-Karind. Lure stan. 11. Since the beginning of November there have been repeated attempts to ambush small parties of Indian troops patrolling the railway line between Dorud and Mazu. These have occurred almost daily of late. The motive may be nothing- more than an attempt to get rifles. The assailants are reported to belong to the Papi tribe of Lurs. Strong representations have been made to the Persian Government. —3 Khuzestan. i ^ ee tings have recently taken place between the Arab chiefs and the local commander of the Persian forces with a view to arranging a settlement that wi put an end to Arab lawlessness. These meetings were, however, not attended 7 turbulent chiefs. One of these, Hussein, the head of the dissident iighaib section of the Cha’ab, with some sixty riflemen recently attacked the ^|lage ot the head of the whole Cha’ab tribe and did appreciable damage, oreneral bhanbakhte will shortly visit Khuzestan and will consult His Majesty’s Consul-General before taking military action. He is of opinion that some of the Arab sections must he disarmed in the interests of the peace of the district. He appears confident of being able to bring this about without causing disturbance. Pars. 13. Several individuals, who have until recently been engaged in pro-Axis intrigues, are now endeavouring to show that their sentiments are really pro- .British. Nasir Qashgai’s brother, Khosrow, has been in to Shiraz and has professed submission to Government to the Governor-General and friendly sentiments towards the British to His Majesty's Consul. He has now gone to see -Nasir, professedly to advise him to come in and make his peace. Nasir would probably be more ready to do so if assured of the stability of Qavam-es-Sultaneh’s premiership, and consequently of the value of his assurances. Other persons, including some tribal chiefs, who, although they have not hitherto ventured openly to support the British cause, have stood aloof from German intrigues, are now hoping for some encouragement to come into the open. 14. On the road there have been a few petty robberies, but during the last week no interference with British traffic. In Tangistan there has been some robbery of Persian caravans by local villagers. Russian Affairs. 15. The purpose of the detachment of Russian troops, which was reported in Summary No. 47/42, paragraph 13, to have been sent to Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. is, according to a statement of the Soviet military commander in Meshed, to prevent the smuggling into Afghanistan of Russian petrol imported to Persia. 16. M. Maximoff, until recently Soviet Consul-General in Khorassan, has been appointed counsellor to the Soviet Embassy in Tehran in place of M. Ivanov, who has returned to Russia. Fighting French Affairs. 17. A mission of French air force personnel consisting of eighteen officers and forty other ranks has passed through Tehran on its way to Russia, where it is to fight for the Russians, flying aircraft provided by them. Turkish Affairs. 18. The version of the Turkish proposal to the Russians for the regulation of affairs on the Perso-Turkish border given in Summary No. 46/42, para graph 17, is incorrect. The proposal was merely that responsible officers should be deputed by Turkey and by Russia to clear up certain outstanding questions.

(Secret.) ——*— Persian Affairs. Political. AS is usual when the early fall of the Gdyernment is expected, paralysis is affecting the Administration. The Prime Minister is devoting most of his time to endeavouring to placate leaders of Majlis parties and individual Deputies, with doubtful success. Inside and outside the Majlis there is considerable hostility to him, and there are many who are determined to-bring about his downfall. A reconstitution of Government which would introduce certain leaders of Majlis parties into the Cabinet is under consideration, but it is as yet doubtful whether that will re-establish the Prime Minister. The situation is approaching a climax where either the Prime Minister or the Majlis must go. 2. The new members whom the Prime Minister is thinking of introducing into his Cabinet are the Deputy Sheikh Ali Dashti (M.A. 75; F.O. 59), a noisy demagogue, now one of his most violent opponents; Murteza Quli Bayat (M.A. 65; F.O. 50), a Vice-President o£ the Majlis; Tadayyun (M.A. 288; F.O. 207), Minister of Education in Ferughi’s Cabinet. It is doubtful whether any of these will be willing to serve under the present Prime Minister. They are all candidates for his post. Economic. 3. An agreement has been signed whereby the British and American Govern ments undertake to supply Persia’s deficiencies in wheat until the next harvest subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. These are that the Persian Government will put into effect all proposals made by the American adviser to the Ministry of Food for the prevention of hoarding, and the introduction of rationing, and also all proposals made by the Joint Road Transport Board for the control of transport. If, after the application of these measures, the Minister of Food, the American Adviser to that Ministry, and the American and British Ministers agree that the amount of wheat available in Persia is insufficient for the minimum needs of the population until the next harvest, then the British and American Governments will, within the limits of their powers, import sufficient wheat to make up the deficit. The Persian Government is responsible for the distribution of the existing stocks of wheat in Persia, making up deficits in one area from surpluses in another, as long as stocks are available. The British and American Governments undertake to assist, within the limits of their powers, with transport for the distribution of wheat, provided that they are satisfied that available transport is being used to the best advantage. In a letter attached to the agreement the British and American Ministers undertake to arrange for the import of 25,000 tons of wheat with the least possible delay. [37-20]2 At a press conference the Prime Minister stated that 1 he estimated that the ^ deficit of wheat before the next harvest would be 130,000 tons. This is reliably considered to be a considerable over-estimate. 4. On the whole, the wheat situation shows little improvement. The increase in the official buying price has not produced notably greater supplies. The purchase of wheat on Government account is now being effected by special agents of the Ministry of Food and no longer by officials of the Economic Depart^V ment of the Ministry of Finance. In a few cases action has been taken against hoarders. A warning has been published in the press that it is intended to apply the Anti-Hoarding Law with full rigour. Mr. Timmerman, the American adviser to the police, has been charged with the'application of the law. 5. Tehran has for some days had insufficient bread to feed its population. Supplies of wheat expected from Shahrud have been detained by Russian troops in spite of the transporting lorries having been provided with the form of pass agreed upon with the Russian authorities. Bread rationing is to be introduced on the 22nd December and a census for the purpose of issuing ration cards is to take place during this week. This may ensure a more equitable distribution of available supplies. The ration is to be 800 grammes for a working man, 200 grammes for a child, 400 grammes for others. 6. The American Adviser to the Ministry of Food at a recent press con ference said that 65 per cent, of the needs of the Allied forces in food were imported. Previously one of the principal causes of high prices had been competition between contractors and agents buying for the British forces. This had now been eliminated, as it had been agreed that British troops would purchase their requirements through the Ministry of Food and its agencies. Onlv food-stuffs surplus to the needs of the Persian nation would be bought. Prices of food-stuffs had dropped 15 to 20 per cent, in the last ten days. He also announced that anyone holding more than 5 tons of wheat would be treated as a hoarder and that 20 per cent, of the value of discovered hoards would be paid to the informer. 7. The Council of Ministers has issued a decree raising the wages of factory workers. The minimum wage is now to be double that of 1941, and factories must supply staple commodities to workers and their dependants at the prices prevailing before September 1941. 8. The Majlis has sanctioned a credit of 43 million rials to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Mines to allow of increased prices being paid for sugar-beet, Air-Raid Precautions. 9. The Government has at last dared to call the attention of the public to the need for air-raid precautions. In a statement to the press it is said that an inter-departmental commission has for some time been studying the needs of the situation and has drawn up certain regulations and instructions which will shortly be communicated to the public. Communications. 10. The press announces the inauguration on the 6th December of regular air postal services between Persia and Russia. The frequency of these services is not mentioned.

Meanwhile, plans are being made by the Persian General Staff for operations against him by four columns, moving on Firuzabad from Jahrum and Kavar, and on Farrashband from Kazarun and Far. Reinforcements of a battalion each are to be sent from the Isfahan and Kerman Divisions.

Russian Affairs. 15. The Soviet authorities are pressing the Persian Government to sign the contract for the manufacture of arms which was reported in Summary No. 45/42, paragraph 11 . The Persian Government is hesitating, firstly, because it fears that it would lead to Russian control not only of their factories but of the sources of raw mateiials required. The contract stipulates that the Persian Government will supply to the factories the necessary raw material available in Persia, which includes wood, coal, copper, sulphur, lead. Secondly, because the Russians insist on paying in rials. Thirdly, because it doubts its own ability to fulfil the contract; penalties for default are heavy, and failure on the part of the Persian Govern ment would probably lead to the Russians taking control themselves.

Tehran, December 15, 1942. n Enclosure. ^ ^ 1 (Secret.) Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 50 for the Period December 9-15, 1942. Persian Affairs. Political. ON the 8 th December a demonstration before the Majlis buildings, staged, there is little doubt, by the Prime Minister’s political enemies, developed into rioting in the afternoon after some hours’ inactivity on the part of the police ana military, who had been called out in the morning. In its eailv stages it was confined largely to boys of the Government schools, but later in the day rougher elements joined in. Some damage was done to shops and restaurants, and the Prime Minister’s private house was looted. Order was not restored until the police and military had opened fire on the mobs. I he number of casualties is not yet known. . . . . , , 2. Attempts have been made to link up this demonstration with the shortage of bread, but there are good reasons for suspecting that it was organised from the Palace and that the police and troops had had orders from some high authority outside the Government not to interfere with the demonstrations. Looting, except perhaps of the Prime Minister’s house, was not part of the programme of the originators of the demonstration, which was clearly directed against the Prime Minister and was meant to bring about his resignation. The bhah telephoned several times during the day to the Prime Minister advising, and even demanding, his resignation, but the Prime Minister, fortified by the advice of the British. Soviet and American representatives, declined to do so. 3. The Shah’s distrust of the Prime Minister Gee Summary Np.-48_/42, ID ^ paragraphs 1 and 2 ) has undoubtedly been accentuated by malicious reports given to him by the Prime Minister s enemies. Among these must be counted the Chiei of the General Staff, General Yazdan Panah, who has never made any secret of his opposition, which he bases on his not unjustifiable contempt for all Persian politicians, to an extension of Cabinet control of the army or any reduction in the Shah’s powers as Commander-in-chief. The Prime Minister is credited with a desire to establish full control of the army by the Ministry for War. There is little doubt that both the Shah and the Chief of the General Staff would welcome the retirement of Qavam-es-Sultaneh and his replacement by a less forceful personality. . „ ^ , 4 . A complication has been introduced into the schemes oi political intriguers by the return to a position of authority of Sipahbod Ahmadi (M.A. 23; F.O. 16). When the riot appeared to be out of control on the 8 th December the Shah, who by that time had become very anxious, proposed that the Sipahbod should be appointed to restore order. This was approved by the Prime Minister after consultation with His Majesty’s Legation, but is now believed to be regretted by the Shah, as the Sipahbod is not friendly to the Shah’s most trusted adviser, the Chief of the General Staff. The Sipahbod is now Military Governor of Tehran and commander of all the forces in the capital. He has re-established order, closed the Majlis, suppressed all the press, and made over 100 arrests, ; *■ . 437—37 | INDIA OFFICE2 including the Chiei of Police, his predecessor in the Military Governorship, seveidl editors of newspapers and schoolmasters, and he is showing his usual i uthless energy in dealing with anyone suspected of trying to disturb the peace. Ihis cheerful scoundrel is much feared; he cares little for persons or laws and is suspected by his countrymen of designs of following in the footsteps of Reza Shah. He has a certain shrewdness, little education, no principles and considerable , forcefulness. h. Tl * 6 blame for originating the disturbances is now being laid variously on the Prime Minister, the British and the Palace. Those interested in accusj^ the first-named are at present the most active. It is said that he instigated .xe distuibailees rather than face the Majlis, as he was due to do on that day, and that he staged the pillaging ol his own house to avert suspicion from himself. 6 . I he Government is publishing a Daily News Sheet, which is now the only paper appearing. It has published proclamations by the Military Governor and the 1 1 ime Minister in addition to home and foreign news. The Prime Minister promises a rigorous enquiry into the origin of the recent disturbances and compen sation to those who have suffered loss. 7. It is understood that the Prime Minister will reconstitute his Cabinet, eliminating the more unpopular Ministers, and perhaps introducing some young blood. The Shah appears to favour experiments with the younger generation and 3 na\ be thinking of posing as the leader of Young Persia. In his conception of Young Persia young army officers probably play a considerable part. 8 . Allahyar Saleh, now delegate of the Persian Government in the United States for economic affairs, has been recalled with a view to his beiim appointed Minister of Finance. Economic. 9. The Prime Minister has sent instructions to officials in the provinces to the effect that, since the Allies have agreed to make good any real deficiency of gram, there is no longer any necessity for provinces to retain more than a few months’ reserves. The grain stocks of the country must be distributed with a view to the needs of the country as a whole in such a way that no district will suffer a present scarcity. 10 . Tehran nearly ran out of wheat, but the situation was saved by the supply of 250 tons from British army stocks. A further 1,200 tons is now on its way from the same source. The Russians are also now allowing small quantities to come down from Northern Persia, having got the Persian Government’s agreement to the supply to them of 18,000 tons of barley, 5,000 tons of wheat and 30.000 tons of rice. In Tehran, in order to eke out bread supplies, 20 tons of cooked potatoes are being distributed to the poor daily at 2 rials per kilog. 11. The first 10,000 tons of the 25,000 tons of wheat promised by the Allies under the Food Agreement is being shipped from Canada, but cannot arrive before January. Meanwhile, possibly as a result of the announcement of these impending arrivals, the price on the black market has dropped. 12 . The Council of Ministers has published a decree fixing the 18th December for the taking of the census preparatory to the issue of bread ration cards for Tehran. Currency. 13. The Russians have asked for an immediate credit of 500 million rials. The Persian Government has not yet signed the financial agreement proposed bv ^38 the Russians (see Summary No. 46 /42. paragraph 5 h A ppointments — Civil. 14—(i) Sarlashkar Muqaddam (M.A. 182) to be Governor-General of Azerbaijan.

Sartip Zahidi, Commander of the Isfahan Division, was arrested on the 7th DecemberRy British troops. It had for long been known that he was in touch with German agents and that he was working against British policy. He had been encouraging Nasir Qashgai to maintain his position among the Qashgai, is strongly suspected of having assisted him with arms and ammunition, and wasgradually creating a position for himself where he might have been dangerous if circumstances deteriorated. The disturbances in Tehran prevented his arrest from creating the stir it might otherwise have done. Official protests have been mild; some excitement and nervousness have been caused in the army, but Zahidi was so generally unpopular and so notorious as a dangerous intriguer that his arrest is a relief to many. The effect of his arrest on the situation in Ears is not yet apparent. j^'pointments — Military. 16.—(i) Sipahbod Ahmadi (M.A. 23; F.O. 16) to be Military Governor of Tehran and commander of all forces in the capital.

An additional battalion of infantry and four mountain guns have reached Shiraz from Tehran. The situation as regards Nasir Qashgai remains as it was. There were two hold-ups of lorries between Kazerun and Shiraz early in December. The robbers were pursued by the gendarmerie and the robbed goods recovered. More activity is being shown by the Persian forces on the road, but in Tangistan there is still lawlessness and insecurity. Khorassan. 18. Villages south and east of Meshed are suffering much from the depreda tions of small armed bands who are too mobile to be dealt with effectively by the gendarmerie. After six weeks without incident, the main road between Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari was raided early in December and 80,000 rials carried off from eight lorries. Further south, some 50 miles from Zahidan, raiders from Afghanistan carried off some twenty-five cases of tea from a convoy. jo2&gt; Russian Affairs. 19. The Soviet authorities in Tabriz have asked the local A.I.O.C. agent to provide them with 5,000 empty petrol tins for packing meat for despatch to the Caucasus. 20. The Russian garrison at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam (see Summary No. 48/42. paragraph 15) is now reported to have been increased to a strength of 500. 21 . Supplies for Russia are again reaching Zahidan from India.

Political. - \ THANKS largely to firm action by the Military Governor, Tehran has calmed down and public confidence is to a large extent restored. No papers have been allowed to appear, except the Government news-sheet* and the Majlis remained closed until Sunday, the 20th December. In certain political circles the Prime Minister’s position has been strengthened as a result of the courage and firmness he is reputed to have shown in the face of the hostile demonstration. The knowledge that he is supported by the Allies and may therefore remain in power for some time has probably induced some of his former opponents to seek his favour as it has for the time being instilled the need for caution into his inveterate enemies. In a broadcast, of which details are given below, he committed himself to loyal co-operation with the Allies more definitely than any Prime Minister has hitherto dared to do. This will undoubtedly concentrate against him the hostility of the many anti-Ally elements, but if he can keep the population fed he has a reasonable hope of increasing the number of his supporters. His position is weak in that at present not only can he not count on the support of the army, but must reckon with active, if underground, opposition from some of its leaders. 2. The Prime Minister, in a broadcast to the nation, claimed that his Government had faithfully endeavoured to follow the programme he had laid down when he took office—the restoration and maintenance of order, the provision of food supplies and the preservation of Persia’s interests in the faithful execution of existing treaties and loyal co-operation with the Allies. The iden tification of Persia’s interests with the Allies was a step in the right direction and had already had good results. There was on the part of the Government no lack of patriotism and devotion to duty, and on the part of the Allies no lack of respect for the freedom and integrity of Persia. Moreover, the Allies were doing everything possible to supply the country s needs in food and transport; the British army had given great assistance by providing wheat from their reserves for Tehran’s bread supply. He said that 156 persons had been arrested in con nexion with the recent riots, those responsible would be punished and if more blood were to flow no harm would be done. Compensation would be paid to those who had suffered damage. In the action that was taken by the Government, he said, they had the benevolent sympathy of the Shah. 3. There is reason to believe that the Shah is by no means reconciled to the continuance in power of Qavam-es-Sultaneh, and that he is still far from having confidence in the Prime Minister. He insisted, against the latter’s judgment, that the Majlis should reopen on Sunday, the 20th December. The meeting was uneventful; the Deputies appeared to be in chastened mood, and the Prime Minister’s address, which was moderate and non-provocative, was listened to with [37—36]2 attention by the Deputies and without hostile comment. The only members of the Cabinet present besides the Prime Minister were the two Ministers without port folio. No announcement has yet been made as to the new composition of the Cabinet. 1 n 4. Reports from the provinces show that neither the riots in Tehran nor the arrest of General Zahidi have had much effect on local opinion, which is concerned mostly with considerations of food and the general rise in the cost living. 4 » Economic. 5. Wheat from British army reserves has been reaching Tehran in sufficient quantities to maintain the daily supply, but beyond the 1,500 tons to come from tha,t source supplies are uncertain. There is a surplus of wheat and barley, estimated at 50,000 tons, available in Azerbaijan, but its arrival depends on transport being available for its collection and on Russian goodwill. Snow is likely soon to make the work of collection more difficult, and the future bread supply of Tehran cannot be considered as anything but precarious. 6 . Ration cards for bread were issued to all the inhabitants of Tehran on Friday, the 18th December. 7. The ration of sugar per head has been fixed for the next two months at 400 grammes of hard and 300 grammes of soft, and of tea at 25 grammes of imported and 25 grammes of locally grown tea. 8 . In order to encourage the production of cotton the Ministry of Agricul ture has increased the price of cotton by approximately 120 per cent, in comparison with last year’s prices. Persian Forces. 9. General Ridley has now presented his proposals for the reorganisation of the Persian army to the Shah. He is not suggesting any great changes in fighting troops, but is proposing the organisation of communication, transport, supply and medical units, which are now practically non-existent; the temporary disbandment of most of the 105-mm. and 150-mm. artillery units and of the Mechanised Brigade; and the distribution of the available pack artillery (sixty-six guns) among the divisions. The strength he proposes is as follows :— 7 divisions of about 5.000 each 3 divisions of about 6,000 each Total fighting strength ... Recruits in depots, about Staffs, training schools, services from Army Budget 35,000 18,000 53,000 ... 15,000 and civilians paid 18.000 Total paid from Army Budget ... ... ... 86,000 He has come to the inevitable conclusion that the first step in any reform is to increase the pay of officers, since present rates of pay are far short of the minimum necessary for an honest livelihood. The increases he proposes would raise the Army Budget to 130 million tomans. 10. It is now possible to form some estimate of the effect on the Persian army of the arrest of General Zahidi. While few regret his disappearance or doubt that there were good reasons for his removal, the arrest by British troops of a Persian officer is generally resented by other officers. It is regarded as a blow to the already low prestige of the Persian officer, and is consequently deprecated by those whose aim it is to improve the morale of the army. No real improvement in morale can, however, be effected without the removal of corrupt and intriguing officers of the type of General Zahidi, and the good effect is likely considerably to outweigh the ill-effects of any temporary resentment. 11 . The press announces that Sipahbod Amir Ahmadi, the present Military Governor of Tehran (see Summary No. 50/42, paragraph 4), is to be appointed Minister for War. This may lead to a tussle between the Ministry of War and the General Staff. Not only are Amir Ahmadi and the Chief of the General Staff rivals and mutually antagonistic, but the constitutional issue of the relation of the Ministry of War to the General Staff is likely to come to a head, for Amir Ahmadi, though he cares nothing for constitutions, being a commanding arid3 ) ambitious man, is unlikely to resist the temptation of trying to establish his personal authority over the army. His appointment as Minister for War has been not only approved but encouraged by the Shah, with what object is not yet clear. ' * A pvoint merits—Military. 12.—(i) Sartip Hassan Arfa (M.A. 37; F.O. 30) to be Deputy Chief of the v^ieral Staff vice Sartip Abdullah Hidayet. (ii) Sartip Muhammad Nakchevan to be Commander of the Isfahan Division. (Not to be confused with Sarlashkar Muhammad Nakchevan.) (iii) Sartip Pourzand, Commander of the Azerbaijan Division, has been recalled at the request of the Russians. (iv) Sipahbod Amir Ahmadi (M.A. 23; F.O. 16) has been awarded the Order of Humayun, 1st Class. (v) Sartip Tajbaksh has been relieved of his command of the 5th (South- Eastern) Division. Fars. Internal Security. 13. Nasir Qashgai’s brother, Khosrow (see Summary No. 48/42, para graph 13), has returned to Shiraz with a message from Nasir to the effect that he (Nasir) is now ready to come to Tehran if he is given a guarantee of life and property by both the British and Persian Governments, and that he is, moreover, ready to live in any place indicated by the British, provided he is allowed to take his family and is guaranteed one-tenth of the revenue he claims. His brother (Khosrow), he said, was prepared to go to Tehran to discuss a settlement. The Prime Minister replied that Nasir must come to Tehran himself under a guarantee of life, when the question of his properties would be sympathetically discussed. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz was also authorised to assure Nasir that no action would be taken against his life by any British authority for anything that was past. The arrest of General Zahidi and the departure of the Deputy Nowbakht from Shiraz, both supporters on whom Nasir relied, combined with the new lease of life given to Qavam-es-Sultaneh’s Government, have possibly persuaded Nasir that he must now make the best terms he can. Meanwhile, the Qashgai tribes and Fars generally are quiet. A zerbaijan. 14. His Majesty’s Consul-General reports fighting between groups of Kurds in South-Western Azerbaijan, and in Tabriz an excited atmosphere due to the exhaustion of official stocks of sugar, the high cost of living and fear that Azerbaijan may be denuded of wheat to feed Tehran. British Affairs. 15. A battalion of British troops arrived in Tehran the day after the riots broke out. It came primarily to protect British military interests, but its prompt arrival was interpreted as an indication of British intention to support the Prime Minister and his Government and it did much to restore confidence in the public. Since it was clearly not in the capital for purposes of coercing the Government, its presence has been little resented and has been welcomed by many. It has created a very good impression.

THE Prime Minister has maintained and perhaps slightly strengthened his position. Certain Deputies are attempting to make their own inclusion in the Cabinet a condition of the support of their followers. No changes in the Cabinet have yet been announced other than the appointment of Sipahbod Amir Ahmadi . to the Ministry for War (see_Summary No. 51/4g, paragraph 12 (iv)). One of the Deputies has given notice^of his intention to interpellate the Government on the matters of food supplies, the disorders of the 8th December, and certain other questions. The interpellation is to be taken on the 29th December. Press. 2. No paper except the Government News Sheet has been allowed to appear' since the 8th December. An amendment to the existing Press Law was passed by the Majlis which says that applicants for permission to publish papers must satisfy the Supreme Educational Council of their financial resources and academic and moral qualifications, so giving the Government the power to refuse a licence to an undesirable person. The amendment also specifies particular punishments for transgressions of the laws of libel. Economic. 3. For the time being the bread supply of Tehran is assured. Imaddition to 1,500 tons of flour from British army reserves and 3,500 tons of wheat from Iraq, now reaching Tehran in regular quantities, about 140 tons of wheat a day are also arriving from other areas. But supplies from the north, in spite of Russian promises of assistance, are uncertain. For example, a number of U.K.C.C. lorries which had backloaded with wheat for the Persian Government from Tabriz, were stopped by Russian troops at Mianeh and forced to unload. Supplies in sight from local sources are likely to run out in 7-8 weeks’ time. Supplies from abroad are unlikely, as at present scheduled, to arrive in sufficient quantities to provide Tehran’s monthly requirements of 7,500 tons. Lack of transport continues to handicap the collection of local supplies. 4. There is much discontent in Tehran with the smallness of the bread ration—400 grammes—allowed for those not classified as workers, and in spite of the Allies’ promises to make good the wheat deficit the public remains appre hensive. With the object of preventing the illicit adulteration by the bakers of wheat issued to them by Government it has been decided that all bread shall be baked in a central bakery under municipal control and that bakers’ shops shall be used for the retailing of bread only. 1 37 -67 j 'rrr-]5. Ihe retail price of rationed sugar has been fixed as follows :— Per kilo Rials. American soft sugar 44 Indian soft sugar 42-9 Foreign lump sugar ... 48-4 Locally made lump sugar 46-2 T ransport. 6. The already critical transport situation has been complicated by a Russian demand for 1,000 civilian lorries to be contracted to the Soviet Trans portation Directorate. These are required for the carriage of lease-lend supplies to Russia from railheads in Persia, and the demand is necessitated by the reduction of the amount of Russian military transport in Persia owing to much of it having been sent to the front. Th^number of lorries required by the Russians can only be obtained at a heavy cost to Persian civil transport requirements, and even then only if tYr&amp;s are provided It is understood that about 1,000 tyres are to be supplied to the Russians from British military reserves. A ppointments — Civil. ritfcein Ala (M.A. 11; F.O. 7). to be Minister of the Court. Persian Forces. Police. 8. To compensate for the high cost of living an extra allowance of 90 rials a month has been sanctioned for the police force to the 21st March, 1943, when the situation will be reviewed. 9. Mr. Timmerman, the American Adviser to the Persian Police, has as yet achieved but little. He is waiting to see whether the Persian Government wall give him the executive powers for which he asks and without which, he says, he will not stay. Gendarmerie. 10. Colonel Schwarzkopf, the American Adviser to the Gendarmerie, has likewise effected nothing concrete. He has travelled widely to investigate existing conditions and has made plans for the reorganisation of the force and the improve ment of conditions of service. An essential reform is the provision of rations to gendarmerie posts, which now have to feed themselves as best they can from the nearest village, often some miles away. As their pay is entirely inadequate to buy sufficient food at the present high prices, they are forced to dishonest practices, and as food is scarce more time is spent in obtaining it than in their duties. For the distribution of rations to gendarmerie posts transport is required, which is not available. A ppointments — Military. 11. —(i) Sartip Muhammad Hussein Amidi, to be Military Governor of Tehran, vice Sipahbod Amir Ahmadi, appointed Minister for War. (ii) Sartip Zarrabi, to command the 5th (South-Western) Division, vice Sartip Tajbaksh, relieved. Internal Security. Pars. 12. Fars remains generally quiet. Nasir Qashgai is still angling for terms. The Prime Minister has agreed to send to him and his brother, Khosrow, a written guarantee of life and a promise of fair treatment as regards their lands. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz has also been authorised to give written assurance to Nasir and Khosrow that British authorities will respect their lives and property provided they conform to certain conditions regarding their place of future residence. Kerman. 13. On the 1st December a convoy of empty lorries on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road was attacked in the Guhra Pass by a band under Ali Muhammad Ali of Yaz Siyah. Of six gendarmes travelling in a lorry, three were killed and two wounded. Their rifles were carried off by the robbers.3 Khuzestan. 14. I he road between Behbehan and Gach Saran, which at this time of the year is liable to be unsafe on account of Boir Ahmadi raids, has been free from mcident since the strengthening of the Persian forces in that area. But between Gach Saran and Ganaweh an A.I.O.C. lorry was held up by alleged Boir Ahmadi t bers, and a telephone house, 27 miles from Gach Saran, was raided and the upants beaten and robbed. / British Interests. 15. Mr. Slater, the Australian Minister designate to Russia, has arrived in Tehran en route to Russia. 16. Persian labour working for the British and American authorities in Khuzestan has for some time past been issued with wheat imported by British authorities. During the latter half of November the number so fed amounted to 25,216 daily. R ussian Interests . 17. The Soviet Consul in Kermanshah has recently been showing an interest in Southern Kurdistan and members of the consulate have been touring' the villages up to the Iraqi border. They have met several chiefs and appear to be interested in British policy towards the Kurds and Kurdish sentiments towards the Russians.

Tehran, January 12, 1943. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military A ttache’s Intelligence Summary No. 2 for Qj. Fa tdk* £ V Jct.lr- the Period January 7-12. 1943. Persian Affairs. Political. HOSTILITY to the Prime Minister is still strong although its expression takes no very active form, nor has any rival candidate appeared who can claim any appreciable measure of popular support. The Prime Minister is accused of being more concerned to reward his friends than to consider the interests of the State in the appointments he makes, and of cherishing ambitions of dictatorship, but much of the enmity felt towards him arises from the belief that he is being i maintained in power by the Allies against the wishes of the people. TLe Shah remains suspicious and distrustful, still determined to resist any attempt on the part of the Government to establish any degree of constitutional authority over the army which would limit the right he arrogates to himself of giving orders to the army without consulting the Minister for War. 2. The Shah was given a very enthusiastic reception by a crowd of about 10,000 spectators at a football match between British and Persian teams in Tehran, which might indicate that attempts that have recently been made to represent him as the champion of youth have not been without success. Economic. 3. A Supplementary Budget Law was passed on the 26th November, which gives additional credits to certain Ministries and administrations amounting to over 27 million rials. Among these the most important are extra credits to the Ministry of Agriculture for irrigation projects of 9,800,000 rials, to the Ministry of Education of 9 million rials, to the Ministry of Health for Ears, Kerman and the Gulf ports of 2 million rials, and to the Central Police Administration for 500 additional police of 1,500,000 rials. 4. The wheat situation not only in Tehran but also in Khuzestan is extremely critical. Tehran is on very short rations and such bread as is issued is largely l adulterated with barley and other matter. A complete failure of supply was avoided only by the issue of another 200 tons from British military sources and the arrival of about 1,000 tons from Azerbaijan. The prospects of any considerable quantities of wheat being allowed by the Russians to leave Azerbaijan are not good as difficulties are being experienced, owing to opposition by landowners and villagers, in collecting the amount of grain promised to the Russians | 5,000 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of barley. Two thousand tons of wheat are available in Khorassan for movement to Tehran, and there are certain other quantities available in the districts of Hamadan and Kurdistan, but here there are difficulties of transport owing to snow-bound roads. These are the only quantities in view for the feeding of Tehran, and Mr. Sheridan, the American'^ v * ser ’ * S - alread . v as ki n g for 20.000 toils of wheat^in addition to the V 25,000 tons promised. V^Transport. 5. A Road I ransport Board, composed of British, American and Persian lepresentatives, has now been formed to control the use of civilian motor transport'-'* m 1 ersia and the distribution of tyres and spare parts with a view to ensuring - '* °v! one h an cl that Persia has sufficient transport for essential needs, and on the other that motor transport is not wasted on unessential tasks. Press. 6. Licences have been issued to four daily papers to recommence publication. A ppointments — Civil. ^' r (i) Assad Bahadur (M.A. 44), to* be Controller of the Household at the Court.

Police. 8- Light police officers of the rank of lieutenant-colonel and above have been placed on the retired list, i he following appointments have been made :— (i) Colonel Sharif, to be head of the Information Bureau. (ii) Colonel Arta, to be head of the Inspection Department. (m) Lieutenant-Colonel furij Amin, to be acting head of the Prisons Department. (i\) Lieutenant-Colonel Ilisam Vaziri, to be head of the Staff Department. ( v ) Lieutenant-Colonel Jahangiri, to be assistant commandant of the Central Police Station. Army. 9. Certain of General Ridley’s proposals for the reform of the army have been approved by the fehah, notably the establishment of recruit training depots at the headquarters of all divisions, and of supply depots independent of formation commanders; the temporary disbandment of field artillery units, with the exception of one regiment for Tehran, and the formation from the animals released of pack and draught transport units; and the immediate institution of a motor driving school in Tehran. General Ridley says he is well satisfied with the co-operation he is receiving from the Chief of the General Staff and other Persian officers. It remains to be seen whether he will be equally satisfied when it comes to the execution of his plans. General Ridley's position is still indefinite. He has, in fact, as yet no official position at all, and it seems that he is in no hurry to force an issue on this point 10. A new Bill to amend the Conscription Law has been laid before the Majlis. The text has not yet been made public. A previous Bill for this purpose led to a crisis between the Prime Minister and the Deputies and was withdrawn (see Summary No. 39/42, paragraph 1). Internal Security. Pars. 11. Qashgai tribesmen, reported as a strong band, principally of the Farsimadan sub-tribe, on the 6th January raided the Bushire-Shiraz road at the top of the Pir-i-Zan Pass and looted a lorry carrying sugar and piece-^oods Seven gendarmes, returning to their post on this lorry, are reported to have had a fight with the laideis, killed six of them and had five casualties themselves The same oand attacked road labourers on the following day, killing one man3 Whether this i aid was instigated by Nazir Qashgai or not is not yet known, but i 6 incons ^ s tent with Qashgai bravado deliberately to raid the road snortiy alter the passage of British military reconnoitring parties. Two of these ave recently been up and down the Bushire-Shiraz road. Nasir was recently reported, to be at Khunj on the extreme southern limit of the Qashgai summer qrmners, and his brother Khosrow at Kazvin, a little further north. Both these okf? i a ^ e . r 1 from the win ter quarters of the main sub-tribes. General fenanbakhte is due to leave Tehran in a few days to take command of the Ears Division. t A measures necessary to improve security on the road from Bushire to Isfahan have recently been investigated in detail by representatives of His Majesty s Legation and of General Headquarters, Persia and Iraq Force. Unless British forces are to undertake protection of convoys on this road* steps will have to be taken to improve the efficiency of the Persian forces. Azerbaijan. 13. Unconfirmed reports have been received of disturbances by peasants as a protest against the delivery of grain to the Russians and the transfer of grain to Iehran. &amp; 14. A small 1 ersian force has been sent to Miandoab. As was reported in bummary No. 47/42. paragraph 9. the Russians had agreed to the despatch of 1 ei sian troops to Mahabad (Sauj Bulagh) to keep order among the Kurds They have since been pressing for the despatch of these troops and the move to Miandoab may be a step in that direction. British Interests. 15. I he battalion of British infantry which moved to Tehran at the time of the riot (see Summary No. 51/42, paragraph 15) has now been withdrawn. ' American Interests. 16. The arrival of numbers of American troops in Persia, some of whom are armed though they may not be classed as combatant troops, and who, since they do not strictly form part of the British forces, cannot claim the right to be in Peisia by virtue of the treaty, has prompted che Persian Government again to that the United States should join the tripartite Alliance to legalise the position of these troops. 17. German radio anti-Ally propaganda in Persia has been levelled mainly against American activities in Persia and alleged American intentions to control Persia’s internal affairs to her own advantage. Russian Affairs. 18. Russian officials continue to take a very active interest in American activities in Persia, particularly those of the advisers to Persian forces. There is some evidence indicating that they do not view with favour the possibility of American control of the army. There are reports that they are initiatino- propaganda against it and, according to the Minister of War, they are encouraging the Chief of the General Staff m his opposition to American executive control. This last statement, although the truth of it is not improbable should be accepted with reserve. 19. In Summary No. 52/42, paragraph 17, it was reported that Russian officials in the Kermanshah district were showing interest in British policy towards the Kurds. British policy towards the Arabs in Khuzestan and British and American activities in South-Western Persia have also been investigated by Soviet consular officials. The Soviet Embassy has now asked for facilities for a mission of twelve members, headed by Professor Pavlovsky, who is a genuine expert in malarial research, to make a scientific survey in South-Western Persia, travelling via Hamadan, Khorramabad, And.imeshk, Abadan, Bushire Shiraz, Isfahan, with permission to take photographs of scientific interest The object of the survey is said to be to investigate bacterial diseases that might affect Russian personnel who may have cause to be in that area. The iournev R expected to last 45 days. Tehran, January 12, 1943., v 1 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

THERE is as yet no noticeable change in the political situation, nor any 4Tk indication that the Prime MinistePhas increased his popularity. In the first issues of the papers recently permitted to appear (see Summary No. 2, 1943, §&lt;xw*»n . paragraph 6) he was attacked for having suppressed the press. He has as yet announced no changes in the Cabinet, although Mehdi Farrukh, the Minister of Food, has resigned. The bread supply of the capital continues to absorb much of the attention of the Government, and the mutual distrust between the Shah and the Prime Minister is a further handicap on the conduct of business. A recent report, however, says that after a lengthy conversation between the two, relations have improved. It is to be feared that it is not likely to be anything but an uneasy association for the Shah appears to have decided to adopt the role of the apostle of social reform and the champion of the oppressed against the class represented by the Prime Minister. 2. The Shah has again expressed his desire for a military alliance with the Allies. He considers that if the country were committed to that extent pro-Axis intrigue would to a large extent disappear and the morale of the army would be greatly improved The declaration of war by Iraq is likely to increase his enthusiasm for his idea. Public reactions to the Iraqi action are not yet apparent. Some Persian officers consider that Iraq has stolen a march on Persia and that Persia should not hesitate to follow the lead. The general public will, however, probably feel that the German armies are still too close to Persia. 3. There has been much talk in Tehran recently among Persians of a German attack on Turkey. It is being suggested that the Germans are deliberately shortening their line in Russia with a view T to withdrawing troops for this operation. Economic. 4. It has been estimated, as reliably as available statistics will allow, that about 66,00*0 tons of grain, in addition^ to the quantities now in Government stores, are required to feed the country up to the next harvest. Of this, Great Britain and America have undertaken to import 25,000 tons; 15,000 tons are believed to be available from areas having a surplus, other than those in the Russian zone, leaving a deficit of 26,000 tons. It is estimated that Azerbaijan could provide 15,000 tons of wheat and the Caspian provinces 20,000 tons of rice if tlhe Russians would allow its export and the Persian authorities were efficient [38—68] m I Lx-o. INenough and energetic enough to collect it. Meanwhile, Tehran still lives from day to day, Khuzestan cannot feed its population, and His Majesty’s Consuls at Shiraz and Kerman report that available stocks are almost exhausted and that supplies will shortly be necessary from outside the province. It is estimated that Ears requires 4,000 tons to last out until the next harvest. Transport. 5. ^ The Persian Government Road Transport Department now contra about 500 contracted lorries. This number does not include fifty lease-lend lorries recently arrived for delivery to the Persian Government. Of these twenty- five are immediately to be allotted for urgent anti-locust measures. A ppointments — Civil. 6. —(i) Dr. Muhammad Iqbal, to be Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Health. (ii) Ali Motamedi (M.A. 175; F.O. 137), to be head of the Protocol Depart ment of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (iii) Ali Asghar Kaivan, to be Persian Consul at Bagdad. (iv) Hussein Zinjani, to be Persian Consul at Basra. (v) Hussein Quli I’tisam, to be first secretary to the Persian Consulate- General at Baku. (vi) Ahmad Zahir, to be secretary at the Persian Embassy, Angora. (vii) Rukn-ud-Din Ashtiyani, to be secretary at the Persian Consulate- General at Jerusalem. Persian Forces. A rmy. 7. I he Shah recently stated to the British Military Attache that he was now following constitutional practice in his command of the army. All orders requiring his approval were now brought up to him by the Minister for War, and no order by himself was legal unless signed by the Minister. This is the form without the substance, for in practice the Shah and the Chief of the General Staff decide What is desirable before the latter submits proposals to the Minister for War. The Shah still clings to his personal control of the army. 8. The strength of the force reported in Summary No. 2, 1943, paragraph 14 to have been sent to Miandoab is about 600. 9. General Ridley has proposed that the gendarmerie, while retaining its separate identity, should be retransferred to the control of the Ministry for War. (i) That since the present tasks of the army and the gendarmerie are the same, viz., the restoration of security, division of responsibility leads to inefficiency. ‘ J (ii) That in present circumstances the gendarmerie requires the close suppoit of the army, and that this is more likely to be achieved if both forces are under the same control, (iii) That a pooling of resources of officers, arms, transport and supply facilities will lead to economy. The question is now being discussed. The Shah supports General Ridley’s proposal; the Prime Minister does not at present favour it, nor, it is believed does Colonel Schwarzkopf, the American adviser to the gendarmerie. Police. 1°. A Bill has been laid before the Majlis to authorise the establishment of a college for the training of officers for the police with the object of endeavouring to improve the standard of police officers. Internal Security. Pars. 11. There are no further developments in the situation in Fars. It is now publicly known that General Shahbakhte is to be charged with the responsibility for security in the province. He is now in Tehran receiving instructions from the Government, and he is expected to leave for Shiraz in about a week’s time. He is making it a condition of his acceptance of the responsibility that he is given certain reinforcements and transport. The reinforcements have been promised,3 u e ^ 10 . of transport has not been solved, as the Persian War Office has none available^ His instructions from the Government are understood to be that e is to bring Nasir Qashgai to heel by force if necessary. It is probable that he wi be given control of security measures affecting the Bakhtiari and Kuhgalu tribes as well as those of Pars.

It is rumoured that he intends to create trouble. The other of General Zahidi’s puppet khans, Manuchir, is now in Isfahan. Kuh-i-Galu. 13. The Kuhgalu chiefs (see Summary No. 12/42, paragraph 16) have recently been attempting to take out insurances. Abdullah Zarghampur, of the Boir Ahmadi, has sent his stepbrother to Behbehan; Farajullah, of the Bahmai, has been making advances to British authorities; Malik Mansur, of Basht, son of Bibi Khanum, chieftainess of the Bavir, and a representative of Hussein Quli, of the Rustam section of the Mamassani, have been to Shiraz to assure His Majesty’s Consul of their desire to serve the British cause. The Bavir profess to be in fear of hostile action against them by the Boir Ahmadi and the Qashquli. Khuzestan. 14. A Persian force has moved out against the Arabs (see Summary No. 48/42, paragraph 12), and the officer commanding in Khuzestan, Colonel Humayun, summoned the sheikhs of some half a dozen tribes and demanded the surrender of their arms. The sheikhs promised to hand them over by the 17th January. Kermanshah. 15. The driver of an empty U.K.C.C. lorry was shot dead in daylight between Kerind and Qasr-i-Shirin some days ago. Details have not yet been received. As was inevitable, it is now being suggested that this incident was put up by General Shahbakhte to demonstrate that security in this province deteriorated with his withdrawal. That may be the explanation. If so, other disturbances may be expected. Kerman. 16. His Majesty’s Consul reports that the Bandar Abbas-Kerman road is insecure and that numerous robberies have occurred. These appear to be genuine robberies for the sake of loot and to have no political significance. Hussein Khan Buchakchi, against whom operations were begun in September 1942 (see Summary No. 36/42, paragraph 18) which led to no result, and who is reported to have harboured Germans for a time, has been quiet of late. Azerbaijan. 17. The Persian War Office has a report, as yet unconfirmed from other sources, that the Jalali Kurds are threatening to loot Maku. Khorassan. 18. An increase of raiding from Afghanistan is expected to result from the poverty and lack of food prevailing in Western Afghanistan. Several raids have already been reported. Russian Affairs. Anglo-Russian Relations. 19. Soviet officials continue to show curiosity and suspicion about American and British activities in Persia. The Soviet Military Attache recently asked a number of questions about road and aerodrome construction by the British military authorities and about British troop movements in East Persia, and seemed sceptical when informed that they were all connected with the improve ment of the supply routes to Russia and of British communications necessary toprotect them. The staff of the Soviet Consulate in Kermanshah now consists of fifteen persons, and their interest in British relations with the Persian Kurds has not slackened. The general impression gained is that the Soviet is suspicious that British activities are not concerned solely with the prosecution of the war, but have post-war objectives. 20. In spite of the fact that they are very short of motor transport, the Soviet authorities refuse to allow U.K.C.C. lorries carrying goods from Zahedan* for Russia to run through to the railway at Askhabad, but insist on goods being off-loaded at the frontier or at Meshed. Officials. 21. Major-General Gaidoukov has arrived in Tabriz and has taken over command of Soviet troops in North-Western Persia. 22. M. Rassandine has taken up the post of Soviet Consul in Isfahan.

Tehran, January 27, 1943. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 4 for the Period January 21-26, 1943. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE Prime Minister has presented the following Cabinet to the Majlis :— (i) Minister without Portfolio : Ebrahim Hakimi. (ii) War : Sipahbod Amir Ahmedi. (iii) Education : Ali Akbar Siassi. (iv) Industry and Commerce : Abdul Hussein Hajhir. (v) Agriculture : Ahmad Adi. (vi) Food : Mehdi Farrukh. (vii) Foreign Affairs : Muhammad Said. . (viii) Justice : Jawad Ameri (F.O. 20; M.A. 15). (ix) Finance: Allehyar Saleh (F.O. 184; M.A. 253). (x) Interior: Farajullah Bahrami (Dabir A’zam) (F.O. 46; M.A. 58). (xi) Posts and Telegraphs : Muhsin Rais (F.O. 172; M.A. 239). (xii) Roads and Communications : Ali Motamedi (F.O. 137; M.A. 175). (xiii) Health : Nasrullah Intezam (F.O. 92; M.A. 121). Numbers (i) to (vii) held the same posts in the previous Cabinet. Numbers (xi), (xii) and (xiii) are the Shah’s nominees. They are relatively young men with a reputation for honesty and without previous Cabinet experience. It is to be hoped that their inclusion will lead to better co-operation between the Shah and the Prime Minister. Allehyar Saleh has recently been economic adviser to the Persian Legation in Washington and his appointment to the Ministry of Finance is believed to be due to suggestion by Dr. Millspaugh. The reappoint ment of Mehdi Farrukh as Minister for Food is surprising, as he had violent disagreement with Mr. Sheridan, the adviser to the Ministry for Food. 2. The Prime Minister has tabled a Bill for the establishment of a new Ministry of Labour and National Economy. This Ministry is to co-ordinate all national economic activities, to provide for the welfare of the working and peasant classes, to find work for the unemployed, and to initiate measures to prevbnt the rise in the cost of living. If is probable that this Bill will meet with criticism in the Majlis on the grounds that its functions are really the functions of the Cabinet. It is not improbable that its formation was suggested, if not urged, by the Shah, who has lately been concerned with the miserable plight of the lower classes and has been preaching reform from above as the only alternative to revolution from below. He and others fear that the influence of Soviet ideals, which are command ing increasing respect and attention, may. however little communism may appeal, incite the lower classes to abandon their long-suffering patience. Conditions arising from the war have greatly increased the contrast between the rich and the poor. On the one hand, large fortunes are being made by contractors and land- owners, on the other, scarcity and ever-rising prices increase the discontent of the3. Ihe Minister designated for the Ministry referred to in the preceding paragraph is Dr. Musharraf Nafisi (F.O. 142; M.A 190). It is known that he 1S . ^7 the Shah, who probably nominated him for this post. He “ ini ^er or hinance in a previous Cabinet and earned some public odium for stabilising the rial-sterling exchange at 140. 4. Ihe declaration of war by Iraq occasioned little audible comment in e ran. It is generally supposed that there is some secret agreement with Great ntain which guarantees to Iraq some reward. Discreet feelers are, however, now being put out towards His Majesty’s Legation to ascertain what reactions would be to suggestions that Persia should follow Iraq’s lead. Economic. 5. The Government has tabled a Bill for the regulation of sowing of crops tor the next three years. I his Bill would empower the Ministry of Agriculture to specify what crops are to be sown in each administrative district, according to the needs of the country in food and raw materials. Agricultural commissions would be formed in each district to ensure that sowing was in accordance with plans. 6. In paragraph 4 of Summary No. 3/43 it was estimated that, taking into consideration 25,000 tons which the Allies have promised to import and estimated available surpluses in areas other than those in the Russian-occupied zone, 26,000 tons of cereals would be required to make good the deficit up to the next j harvest. Indications are that very little will be allowed to leave the Russian zone and it is now estimated that 7,100 tons of wheat and 16,500 tons of barley will have to be imported from abroad. This is on the assumption that bread wilb contain 60 per cent, of wheat and 40 per cent, of adulterants. 7. A decree of the Council of Ministers frees the import of cotton to Persia. The import is limited to cotton grown in Russia, Egypt, India and Iraq. The crop of local-grown cotton is insufficient to keep the spinning factories fully employed. J 8. Military courts in Tehran have recently imposed sentences for seven cases of infringement of the Anti-Hoarding Law of fines ranging from 10,000 to 5,000 rials and of imprisonment from forty days to two months. Press. 9. A total of thirteen newspapers have now been given licences to publish m Tehran. Before the general suppression of the Tehran press over forty were appearing.

No further incidents have been reported since the raid on the Bushire- Shiraz road by the Farsimadan reported in Summary No. 2/43, paraoraph 11 General Firuz has stated that he intends to make an early move on Firuzabad this presumably to forestall General Shahbakhte’s assumption of responsibilitv Reports say that Nasir Qashgai has already agreed to make no more than a token opposition to this operation. Nasir himself was last reported far from Firuzabad A zerbaijan. 13. Further reports have been received of the lawlessness of Jalali Kurds in the vicinity of Maku.3 * British Affairs. 14. An aircraft carrying four Persian officers, who were going on a visit to Iraq and Kgypt as the guests of the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq and Persia; the air attache to His Majesty’s Legation, Group Captain Greenlaw, and the Director of the Public Relations Bureau, Mr. Childs, was lost soon after leaving Tehran on the 18th January. For several days following bad weather ^ind severe snow-storms hampered search and it was not until the evening of the I 1th January that a reliable report was received that the aircraft had been found about 100 miles west of Tehran, crashed in the mountains, and that all the occupants had been killed. The Persian officers were General Ibrahim Arfa, Colonel Qahrimani, Majors Afkhami and Shaibani : the last three of the Persian Air Force. Russian A ffairs. 15. The Persian Government recently sent notes to His Majesty's Legation and the Soviet Embassy regarding the provision of shelters for people who might have to be evacuated from the air-raid target area of the railway station and its workshops. The counsellor of the Soviet Embassy visited the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and said that the Soviet authorities considered that discussion of » air-raid precautions at this stage was a reflection on the Red Army.

THE new Cabinet has been received generally without enthusiasm or criticism. The introduction of new blood is welcomed, but the people are far more concerned with the worsening economic situation, and by their handling of that the new Cabinet will be judged. 2. The paper Keyhan. which has in the past been, and may still be, subsidised by the Shah, recently published an article which stressed that Persia was now suffering some of the evils of war without hope of being compensated when peace was signed. The general trend of the article was a vague suggestion that Persia should now join the United Nations. The press generally has refrained from comment on Iraq’s declaration of war, and there is no indication of any public enthusiasm for similar action by Persia. Economic. 3. The food situation in almost all parts of Persia, except the Soviet- occupied zone, is causing the greatest anxiety. In Tehran the bread is so adulterated as to be almost uneatable and no bread at all is obtainable in the suburbs. The temper of the poor is approaching an outbreak. No grain can be expected from Azerbaijan, at least for some time to come, as the transport available is only barely sufficient to keep Tabriz supplied and at the same time to maintain deliveries to the Russians in accordance with the agreement made that they should have 20,000 tons of grain. In Shiraz and Kerman local stocks are fast being exhausted and no surpluses of wheat are available in other parts to make up the deficit. 4. The Council of Ministers has published a decree prohibiting entirely the export of raisins, walnuts, dates, peanuts, macaroni, tinned fish, meat and vegetables. Other dried fruits and nuts, oil-seeds, pork and lard may only be exported against the import of other food-stuffs or cotton and woollen goods. T ransport. 5. The Road Transport Department has announced that the rates per ton-kilometre for transport by lorries under its control vary from 2 rials for a complete lorry load to 4 rials for smaller consignments. The movement of goods is permissible only through the agency of the Road Transport Department. 6.

His Majesty’s Consul-General, in an analysis of the Kurdish situation in Western Azerbaijan, states that, in his opinion, the Russians are not now giving the Kurds any encouragement as against the Persians, but that they are definitely not encouraging the Persians to disarm the Kurds or to reimpose authority on them by force. They appear to be endeavouring to hold the balance between the Persians and the Kurds and to be using their influence to maintain order. The Kurds are disillusioned and suffering from reaction from previous hopes of Russian support and from economic difficulties. The leaders are maybe realising that they cannot control the tribes nor secure unity of aim. The opportunity seems favourable for a just and reasonable settlement by the Persian Government, but it is doubtful whether they have the capacity to seize it. Fars. 13. It is reported that Elias Khan, one of the more important chiefs of the Kashguli tribe of the Qashgai, has left the entourage of Nasir Khan and returned to his own tribe, who are in their winter quarters south-west of the Mamassani lands. If this is true it may be significant, as Elias was the most important of the Qashgai Khans in constant and close contact with Nasir. 14. Some nervousness has been shown by Mamassani chiefs as a result of visits to their country of British reconnaissance patrols. The Mamassani have on the whole hitherto remained aloof from Nasir’s intrigues. They have, however, uneasy consciences because they are in possession of a number of Persian armv rifles which they are reluctant to surrender. Nervousness might conceivably induce them to make common cause with Nasir if he decided actively to oppose the Government. Khuzestan. 15.

Tehran, February 10, 1943. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 6 for the Period February 2 to 9, 1943. Persian Affairs. Political. THE newly reconstructed Cabinet had a short life. A dispute occurred between the Prime Ministef^and the Minister of the Interior, Fara jullah Bahrami, and the latter refused to resign when called upon to do so by the Prime Minister. T he Shah refused to order his resignation or to accept the Prime Minister s. The latter then called upon his Ministers to resign and ten of them did so. For some days there was much intrigue among the Deputies of the Majlis by both the Prime Minister and Court circles, but, in spite of the hostility generally felt by the Deputies towards the Prime Minister, he succeeded in getting a vote of confidence by 65 votes to 42. Following this, the rebellious Minister of the Interior resigned, and the Government now consists of the Prime Minister and the Ministers for War, Finance and Health. 2. The root of these troubles lies in the absence of confidence between the Prime Minister and the Court. The Minister of the Interior was the Shah’s nominee, and it was the Prime Minister's objection to his having direct access to the Shah that led to the dispute between them. The aim of the Court appears to be to have a subservient Prime Minister. The Majlis wavers between its dislike of the Prime Minister and its fear of the re-establishment of a Royal autocracy. The explanation of the vote of confidence given to Qavam-es-Sultaneh mav be the lack of any substitute generally acceptable to the Majlis. 3. A strong campaign has been launched in some papers in favour of the return to Persia of Sayyid Zia-ed-Din Tabatabai (F.O. 206; M.A. 286), who has been in exile for over twenty years It does not appear to have yet evoked much popular enthusiasm. It is doubtful whether his return to power would be welcome to either the Russians or the Shah. The former regard him as too pro-British, an accusation which his supporters are now trying to refute. The Shah fears that he might wish to revenge himself for his (the Shah’s) father’s having driven him out of Persia after they had collaborated together to bring about the coup d'Etat of Economic. 4. Reports have been received from the provinces of the extent of autumn sowings. They show that, except in the neighbourhood of Khorramshahi\ in Lurestan and Kerman Provinces they have been up to or above normal on irrigated lands and slightly below normal in some areas on unirrigated lands. 5. Discontent increases in Tehran with the very poor quality of bread being issued and its shortage. Prices of food-stuffs continue to rise in a very steep [39—25] f ' f\ 1 ^ ' H- tTL ■cuive and the people are approaching a state of desperation where riots may occur. Minor riots have already occurred at Shiraz and Isfahan. 6. Comment is sometimes made nowadays, even by senior American officials, contrasting very unfavourably to the British, conditions in the Russian-occupied zone with those prevailing in the remainder of Persia. In the former, owing to the restrictions imposed by the Russians on export to other parts of Persia, food is plentiful and prices are low. An attempt to purchase sheep in the Northern 1 rovmces, where they are plentiful and relatively cheap, for British forces was ^ resented and blocked by the Russians. To advertise the advantages of the poorer classes living in the Russian zone is deliberate Russian policy. Stories are in circulation of Russian troops having prevented British purchasing agents from removing food-stufts from the Northern Provinces out of consideration for the needs of the local people. 7. A company to be called the National Joint Stock Commercial Corporation (Shirkat Sehami Bazargani Melli) is to be formed with a capital of 120 million rials for the purpose of import and export trade. One-third of the capital is to be subscribed by the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. Press. 8. Licences to publish have now been issued to fifteen more papers in Tehran, making a total of twenty-eight.

Sarhang Humayun is to command the division. 12. The brigades at Kermanshah and Khorramabad are to be formed into a division, with headquarters at Kermanshah, commanded by Sartip Zarrabi. 13. The brigade organisation is to be abolished in the Persian army wherever divisional headquarters can exercise direct command of units.

(ii) Sarlashkar Farajullah Agevli (F.O. 25; M.A. 6), to be Military Governor of Tehran. Internal Security. Pars. 15. The situation remains quiet. General Shahbakhte has left Tehran for Shiraz. He has been appointed Governor-General of Fars and Commander-in- Chief of Persian Forces in Khuzestan, Isfahan and Fars. He has been directed to devote himself in the first place to the re-establishment of Government authoritv in Fars, to the elimination of the influence of Nasir Qashgai; the apprehension of Germans, and security of the Bushire-Shiraz road. He is later to turn his attention to the Kuh-i-Galu, particularly the Boir Ahmadi tribes and the Bakhtiari. 16. Nasir Qashgai is now reported to be at Dehram, some 30 miles south west of Firuzabad, and to have some Germans there with him. 17. It is reliably reported that during the past fourteen months 488 highway robbers have been apprehended in the Fars Province.9 Khuze stan. lb - 1 he number of rifles surrendered by the Arabs (see Summary No. 5/43, paragraph 15) now amounts to 479.

AFTER a week of discreditable political intrigue Kawam-es-Sultaneh resigned. In spite of the vote of confidence given to him by the Parliament he was unable to form a Government. He obtained that vote by means that added nothing to his credit. In the hope of securing the support of certain Deputies who aspired to Cabinet rank, he tabled a Bill to abrogate the fundamental law that no Deputy may become a Minister, and to placate others he announced his agreement with a Bill tabled by a majority of Deputies to establish Majlis control over the appointment of the Governor of the National Bank, a proposal to which Dr. Milspaugh, the American financial adviser, had taken exception. After obtaining his vote of confidence, Kawam-es-Sultaneh announced that in view of Dr. Milspaugh’s objection (of which he had been aware all along) he had changed his mind. He further antagonised the already hostile court by suggesting in a speech to the Majlis that, in order to strengthen the authority of Parliament and to establish the sovereignty of the people, changes should be made in the Constitution. In the end Kawam-es-Sultaneh found himself with practically no active supporter except the Soviet Ambassador. Considering that he has enjoyed strong Allied support throughout his tenure of office, and considering his reputation and experience, the record of his Government has been very disappointing. The blame for its failure must not be laid entirely on the shoulders of the Prime Minister. His legitimate intention to establish Cabinet control over the army brought him into conflict with the Shah and the Chief of the General Staff, and they and other interested persons made play with the irresponsible obstructiveness of a venal Majlis to undermine his position. His Government did, in. fact, fail to take any effective action against hoarders and ctfvJel h*^Yspeculators, to check rising prices, or to prevent excessive inflation . It is true j. that it co-operated with the British in the matter of extra issues of currency and to some extent m tne arrest and detention of suspects, but it leaves to its 0 U) . successor a critical economic situation, an Administration w T hich has, if anything, grown more lax and corrupt, and the task of establishing in the provinces the authority of the Central Government, whose prestige is now lower than ever. It was well known that he enjoyed Allied support, and his fall may diminish the moral value of that support to future Governments. 2. His successor is to be his predecessor, Soheily, who was forced to resign some seven months ago after a short tenure of office during which he established an impressive record of ineptitude and corruption. He has again been selected by the Majlis by a considerable majority over other candidates. The Shah, as was known to the Majlis, wished Said, until lately Minister for Foreign Affairs, to become Prime Minister. It is considered unlikely that Soheily will be able to form a stable Government or to check the growing discontent. [39—64] IEIdl POL BEPt. '5 APR H3 INDIA OFFICE2 3. I here is increasing talk among the lower classes of the advantages of living in the Russian zone or, indeed, under a Russian regime. The Tuden, the People’s party, w T hich gets discreet Soviet encouragement, is increasing in numbers and influence and has recently ventured to come out in open support of the Soviet in the hitherto strongly anti-Russian town of Tabriz. The upper classes grow more concerned about these signs. Moreover, the impressive demonstration of Russia s strength and the elimination of Germany as a possib’ saviour have aroused considerable anxiety as to the position Soviet Russia will occupy in post-war Asia. The result is a growing desire in certain circles for closer collaboration with Great Britain and at the same time resentment that Great Britain does not make it easier to feed the hungry poor without diminishing the comforts of the propertied classes. That Persia should declare war on the Axis is now being more widely advocated. Economic. 4.

There have been no serious disturbances of the peace, but throughout the provinces administration is lax and petty robbery is rife. British military stores suffer, and the theft of telegraph and telephone wire is a particular nuisance. Russian Affairs. 9. The Soviet \ ice-Consul at Isfahan and two Russian military officers recently visited Anarak, presumably with a view to investigating the copper mines in wPich the Russians are now interested in view of their contract with the Persian Government for the manufacture of ammunition. 10. According to the Minister for War the Soviet Ambassador in a recent conversation made no secret of his disapproval of the introduction of American advisers into Persian administrations, particularly the army and gendarmerie. If Persia needed foreign advisers at all. he asked, why were'Americans chosen? Was not the Soviet Union the best administered State in the world? ( 11.

The programme of the Cabinet has been announced as the supply of food, the stabilisation of prices, the improvement of the welfare of peasants, workers and Government employees, and co-operation with Great Britain, America and the U.S.S.R. The Government received a vote of confidence on the 21st February by 89 votes to nil, but previous to this there had been a stormy session in which some Deputies were in rebellious mood. Attacks were made on Mr. Sheridan, the American Adviser to the Ministry of Food, and on Mr. Birkle, the British Adviser to the Road Transport Department. The right of American troops to be in Persia was challenged, since America was not a party to the Tripartite Treaty of Alliance. The Prime Minister stated that the American Government had agreed to make an agreement to regularise the position of their troops. Economic. 3. Tehran is on the verge of starvation. The daily death rate has trebled. A complete breakdown of bread supplies has been averted more by luck than management, and the bread issued is almost undatable.

THE name of the Minister of Finance, Allahyar Saleh, was omitted from A ^ dAthe list of the Cabinet given in paragraph 1 of Su mmary No. 8/43. • 2. The shortage of bread in the country in general and the capital in particular overshadows all other questions in the deliberations of the Government. • Hectored and lectured by the press and the Deputies on the need for immediate and drastic action to bring down prices and to secure wheat from hoarders and Allies, the Prime Minister, with no definite plan as to how either object is to be achieved, finds himself in need of all the qualities of suppleness for which he is famous. The press and the Deputies are in truculent mood. Questions have been asked in Parliament about the arrest of General Zahidi and the press has publicised an alleged assault by a British officer on a Persian official. 3. Anti-British feeling, as distinct from pro-Axis or anti-Ally, has been much in evidence. In addition to famine conditions, a shortage of kerosene oil for some days past has affected a large number of the poor of Tehran and has aroused much bitterness against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and against the British, who are believed to control the means of transport. That Persian people have to go short of their own oil is a useful and effective theme for hostile propaganda, which has not failed to make use of it. The resulting increased unpopularity of the British among the lower classes is a matter of some concern to those Persians who have been seeing in closer collaboration with the British the only defence against the spread of Russian influence. They, too, blame the British for failing to remedy, if not for having brought about, the hardships which are driving the people towards revolution. 4. According to the daily reports of the Persian police the Tudeh party, to which reference was made in Summary No. 7/43, paragraph 3, has recently been showing greatly increased activity. New cells are being formed, Socialist literature is being distributed and propaganda with an extreme Left tendency is being disseminated. Whether inspired by this or other sources, there is nowadays among the poorer classes much favourable comment on Soviet ideas and practice, accompanied very often by disparaging comparison with British imperialism. Stories, without any foundation, of chivalrous Russian soldiers intervening to protect Persians, often women, from lawless British soldiers are in favour. Publicity of the economic assistance given by the British to Persia is openly derided. Closed bakeries and oil shops have more effect than any poster. Against this must, however, be set the good effect on the few of the charitable work being done by Anglo-Persian relief committees which have been set up in most provincial capitals. 5. In an effort to limit dishonesty, the Ministry of Finance, inspired by Dr. Milspaugh, has issued orders that no purchases on Government account and no sales of Government stores are to be made by other Ministries without previous sanction of the Ministry of Finance. The Department of Supply is to be reorganised, and when this has been done all purchases on Government account will be made by that department. v-yxi- [39—45] •SU. POL. DI PT. ' 5 APR ^43 IMPIA OFFICEPress. 6. The press is concerned mainly with the internal economic situation. Strongly worded articles have appeared stressing the obligation of the Eritish and the Americans to provide the wheat for whose deficiency, it is hinted or sometimes plainly stated, they are to blame. Attacks continue to be made openly on Mr. Sheridan, on the 'Road Transport Department, on its British adviser and covertly on all American advisers. Internal Security. Pars. 7. General Shahbakhte has not yet taken any active measures against Nasir Qashgai. He is awaiting the arrival of transport, which has been promised by General Headquarters, Persia and Iraq Force, and further reinforcements. Meanwhile, the main roads are undisturbed and the lawless elements of the province are lying low. Nasir Qashgai has telegraphed to the Parliament to the effect that in view of the guarantees that had been given to him he was at a loss to understand the military preparations of which he had news and that he would no longer accept any responsibility for the good behaviour of the Qashgai. A strong effort is being made by Nasir’s friends in Tehran and in Pars to persuade the new Government to stay Shahbakhte’s hand and to reopen conciliatory negotiations with Nasir. Among these friends are landowners in Pars who have, in return for their support, secured some immunity for their properties from Qashgai depredations and who are doubtful whether any Government will last long enough or be sufficiently determined in a consistent policy to establish Government control throughout Pars. 8. Sixty-two Government rifles that had been issued by a previous commander of the troops in Pars to the Baseri tribe of the Khamseh Federation for their protection against the Qashgai have been recovered by the Persian forces. Kuh-i-Galu. 9. A band of Boir Ahmadi brigands have during the past month been active in the Gach Saran-Behbehan road Travellers have been held up, gendarmerie posts attacked and villages looted. Khorassan. 10. Some anxiety is felt regarding the security of the Zahidan-Meshed road, as it is developed for the transport of supplies to Russia. The convoys on this road will be a tempting bait for raiders from Afghanistan, who are unlikely to be restrained by Afghan officials. The Persian security forces are handicapped by lack of mobility. Western, Azerbaijan. 11. That the substitution of Kurdish autonomy for Persian Government administration is not always an unmixed blessing is shown by conditions in Mahabad. When Persian administration broke down in Western Azerbaijan at the time of the Russian invasion and Persian forces disintegrated, the inhabitants donned Kurdish dress and openly rejoiced in their imagined liberty. To-day they are in sorry plight. Trade conditions, already bad, have been aggravated by insecurity, while prices of food-stuffs are very high because considerable quantities have been sold over the western border. His Majesty’s Consul-General in Azerbaijan considers that a moderate display of statesmanship by the Persian Government would win back to loyalty a number of the inhabitants more interested in security than in the profits of insecurity. Russian Affairs. 12. Professor Pavlovsky’s expedition (see Su mmary No. 2/4 3, paragraph 19) to South-West Persia has now returned to Tehran. It was accompanied through out by a British officer. It engaged in no objectionable activities, but the members showed interest in a wide range of subjects, social, economic and topographical. 13. During the first half of February 1,357 tons of supplies for Russia were carried over the Zahidan-Meshed route. 14. From both Meshed and Tabriz come reports of a slight deterioration in the previous very high standard of discipline of Russian troops that had contributed much to the respect that was beginning to be felt by all except the upper classes for the Russian system.

THE Government has been making endeavours to secure the co-operation of the Majlis. With the object of associating the Deputies with the Government in devising measures to deal with the urgent problems of the day, notably food supply, the control of prices and the welfare of the lower classes, separate committees are to be formed for each of these problems composed of Deputies, w'ho are to be chosen by the Majlis, and Ministers. 2. The press has been taking advantage of an unbridled freedom to attack {the Allies in a number of vehemently outspoken articles. Scarcity, high prices, inflation, lack of transport are all due to heavy consumption by the Allies, to their large demands for currency and their monopoly of the means of transport. Persia should have resisted to the last man. Annihilation in battle against the Allies would have been better than slow annihilation by starvation. Persia had fulfilled her undertakings under the treaty in placing her roads, her railways, her harbours and communications at the disposal of the Allies. The Allies had not kept their promises regarding economic assistance and were callously letting \ Persia starve to death. The articles are usually so worded as to make it clear that, of the Allies, Great Britain is the real criminal. Where anti-British ! sentiments were formerly to a large extent merely a fashion, they are now founded on what is widely believed to be a genuine grievance, and Nazi sympathisers have the pleasure of saying : “I told you so.” In addition to the deliberate exacerbation of popular resentment against Great Britain, there is in some papers a campaign against the propertied classes and hardly veiled incitement to revolution. 3. While there is at present little love for Great Britain, there is an | increasing number of Persians of the propertied classes and the intelligentsia who from fear of Russian post-war policy would be glad to seek British support. The motive in most cases may be selfish, but not in all. In the present atmos phere. however, an open expression of belief in the virtue of closer association with Great Britain and Persia requires more courage than is usually to be found. Economic. 4. The bread situation in Tehran has very slightly eased, but the condition of the people in the poorer quarters of the town is really bad. Deaths from starvation are not uncommon and malnutrition is increasing the death-rate from disease. In many of the towns failure of the bread supply is being staved off only by the strenuous endeavours of the consular liaison officers. The Ministry of Food and its American adviser are still being heavily criticised and attacked, and it required some courage on the part of the veteran politician, Tadayyun. hitherto Minister without Portfolio, to accept the Ministry of Food.2 5. The Ministry of Agriculture has been given a credit of 10,200,000 rials to finance spring sowings. 6. The Majlis has, after much discussion and uninformed criticism, passed a Bill authorising the exchange of gold coins now held as a backing for the note issue for gold in bars of equal weight. The gold bars will be provided by His Majesty’s Government and the gold coins will be sold by the banks at the highest obtainable price in rials, which will be credited to His Majesty’s Government’s account in Persia. It is hoped that the gold coins will be hoarded and that the ' effect will be to absorb some of the present purchasing power of the country. A ppointments — Civil. 7. —(i) Seyyid Muhammad Tadayyun (M.A. 288; F.O. 207), hitherto Minister without Portfolio, to be Minister of Food Supply.

Active efforts are still being made to induce the Government to refrain from military operations against Masir Qashgai. General Shahbakhti is not yet able to act, as the transport promised him has not yet arrived. His inactivity is to some extent allaying the healthy fears aroused on his appointment that his arrival in Shiraz would be followed by swift action, and is raising the hope that the intrigues of Nasir’s supporters are being effective. But Nasir himself is in some perturbation, and it is reported that he is finding no great willingness among the tribes to rally to his support. Meanwhile, the roads remain undisturbed. Khuzestan. 11. To the end of February 715 rifles had been surrendered by the Arabs. The Khasraj Abdullah (see Summary No. 8/43, paragraph 8), with the exception of one-third, made their submission on the appearance of the Persian forces. The recalcitrant third, after a brush with the Persian forces, withdrew, leaving their families in the hands of the Persian troops. Operations against the Beni Turuf have not yet begun. Russian Affairs. 12. The Tudeh party in Khorassan and Azerbaijan is now publishing propaganda on conventional Communist lines. The peasants are being incited to unite to oppose exploitation by the landlords and demonstrations of sympathy with Russia are being organised. 13. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that 2,000 Soviet troops with some tanks have left Meshed for Askhabad, and that 200 railway technicians have recently passed through Kuchan on their way to the railway at Shahrud.

While the Government cannot yet be said to have established much conlidence that it is likely to be more stable than its predecessors nor has the prime Minister yet shown that he has acquired greater capacity to control the Press and the deputies, the Cabinet does realise the urgent need for some measures of social reform to counteract the growing agitation among the lower classes in the towns and the effects of alleged Russian propaganda, a bogey that lo »ms larger daily. To this end it is proposing to give to Dr. Millspaugh extensive powers to take measures to stabilise prices; it has introduced legislation to prevent the forward purchase of crops by speculators and is seeking advice for a programme to improve the conditions oi' the lower classes. .hether any measures to control prices in this e untry of corruption and lax adni istration will be more than very limitelly effective is doubtful. 2. Active agitation in favour of the return to Persia of Zeyyid Zia ed Din Tabatabai continues. It is said that it is having some effect in convincing the lower classes that he can be the saviour of Persia, but it is dou tful whether he yet commands xk nearly enough support to give him a reasonable chance of being a success as head of the administration. His supporters, however, consider th .t by the end of April the ground will have been sufficiently prepared to justify his return, provided it has been possible to allay the Shah's suspicious. 3. The Tudeh Party (see Summary No.9/43, paragraph 4) has been at some pai is recently to clear itself of tne accusation of being under Russian influence and to assert that its aims and methods are entirely constitutional and patriotic. Icon mic. 4. The 250 million r credit of 500 interest is o Ministry of food has .als for the purc&amp;kue million rials having ;ing shown by members been given a further credit of of foodstuffs, the previous be^n exhausted. A lively of the Majlis in the expenditure of this latter sum and in a preliminary statement, the Minister of Food said that 300 millions had been expended on cereals that had been re-sold to the baxers, 100 millions on commodities re-sold to the public and 100 millions on couimodities still in stock He added that the Government had supplied 88 towns in Persia with grain. J ^ 5 # Consequent on the arrival of wheat from tne rersian Gulf and of barley from Iraq, bread supplies in Tehran have been /more i/2 more plentiful, and it i r hoped that the really critical period (J/J is now over. There is, however, as yet no reserve in Tehran and in the provincial towns the position remains precarious. A fairly serious bread riot broke out in Khorramabad which had to be quelled by military action, and economic conditions in parts of hermanshah 1 rovince anr? in Lurestan are reported to be so bad as likely to lead to disorder. 6. ^ A British broadcast to clarify the position as regards Allx &gt;as: istance to Persia in the matter of cereals met with stro 'criticism in the Tress and caused some alarm to the public^t It was interpreted as meaning that such assistance was still conditional and should not be taken for granted and resulted in some buying up of stocks of foo stuffs. A later statement has done something to reassure public opinion. 7. The Government has issued a Decree making forward buying of certain foodstuffs an offence. The commodities specified are wheat, barley, rice, potatoes, d ter, peas, beans. Forward transactions completed before the date of the Decree are to be cancelled. 8. The Government has laid a dill before the ?. ajlis the purpose of which is to give to Dr. Uiispaugh extensive powers to control prices and the distribution of commodities other than foodstuffs. The dill proposes to s notion 5 million rials for the expenses of the necessary administration and a credit of 10 million rials for the purchase of commodities to be retailed by Government organisations. Dr. Dillspaugh is to be authorised to engage nine Americans for the price-control administration. Press. 9. Britain's Treaty of existence continues to ounlish strong criticism of Great The press ■■■I practi al interpretation of the undertaking in the Alliance that the Allies would safeguard the economic oi the Iranian people. Some of the articles are distinctly objectionable in tone. A letter addressed to tne Soviet Ambassador and H.M. Minister accusing them of having secured by unlawful pressure and interference the suppression 3 f a certain paper was published in the press. At tne same tine articles eulogising Russia have appeared. One of these °xr.r* : sons appreciation of the pood treatment, good manners and respect shown to Persians of all classes by Russians in Persia and compares the comfort and ease assured to Persians in the Russian zone as regards food sup.lies with the iamine prevailing in other parts of the country. T t concludes: M All can now see the difference between Russians and others'. 10. The Government realises that the unlimited freedom now being enjoyed by the Press might eventually be a langer to itself but fears to take action. It is considering charging the Minister for War, Mipahbod Amir Ahmadi, with the additional responsibility of the- Military Governorship of ’ehran, hoping that the enmity that would be aroused by the repressive Tieasures he would probably take w^uld be concentrated on him. /3 (£&gt; ir* .

The Deputy Noubakht, who has for* long been encouraging Nasir Qashgai to hid out against the Government, recently made a vehement and objectionable speech in the Majlis in favour of Nasir and in opposition to the execution of any military measures in Fars that might affect Nasir 1 s position. He took the opportunity to make a violent attack on the Army. Members of the Majlis gene -ally showed strong disapproval of his speech, but at the same time seemed to incline towards further negotiation with a view to avoiding bloodshed.

The vested interests are mobilising their forces o oppose the grant to Dr. Millspaugh of the special powers proposed by the Government (see Summary N o. 11/43, paragraph 1). Some agitation still goes on against the Government’s announced'! n tent ion of re-establishing its authority in Pars a nd m the tribal areas generally, which is not without effect on some members ot the Government. 1 his agitation has at least brought into prominence the problem ol the tribes and the necessity for a clear-cut tribal policy which will preserve such value as they have while restricting their predatorv habits. The appointment of Ahmad I tebar as Minister of Agriculture has disappointed those who hoped for an energetic agricultural policy which might include some measures to encourage the tribes to settle. Economic. ., „ v6 U-l 2. The Anglo-Iranian Financial Agreement which was signed in May 1942 (see Summar y No. 22/42, p aragraph 11) is now before the Majlis for ratification. In the course of his speech in justification of the agreement, M. Bader. Minister of Industry and Commerce, who was Minister of Finance when the agreement was signed, gave the following particulars of transactions in sterling durino- the nine and a half months from the 28th May. 1942. to the 10th March. 0 1943 Purchases of sterling from the Allies Purchases of sterling from other sources... € Sterling 18,259,512 5,004.710 Total 23,264.222 Sales of sterling by the banks Purchase of gold from the Bank of England ...

Comparison with the more onerous terms of the draft Russo-Persian Financial Agreement, which had been debated in secret session a few days previously, has probably induced a greater readiness to accept the British Agreement. 3. A Bill has been laid before the Majlis to authorise the issue of tax-free Treasury bonds to the limit of 500 million rials. It is understood that these are to he short-term bonds, though neither the term nor the interest has yet been settled. The same Bill proposes to authorise the increase of the amount of coinage of low denomination now in circulation from 54^ million rials to 75 million rials. 4. An accident on the railway which held up traffic for a few days nearly produced another bread crisis in Tehran, which had been living to a large extent on the wheat arriving daily by rail from the Persian Gulf. In Kermanshah conditions have slightly improved. Tabriz had been reduced on the 10th March to a reserve of two days’ supply, but there is ample wheat in the province, which is being prevented from reaching Tabriz partly by difficulties of transport and partly by intrigues to discredit the American representative of the Ministry of Food and to force the Government to purchase on the black market. Unusually good rains, which have been fairly widespread, have raised hopes of a good harvest, but this has not yet had much noticeable effect on the amount of wheat offered for sale. Press. 5. The press continues its attacks on Great Britain and its incitement of the poor. Two papers have been suppressed, and it is probable that this will have the effect of modifying the virulence of the remainder. Appointments — Civil. 6. Ahmad I’tebar. Deputy for Burujird, to be Minister of Agriculture. Persian Army. 7. The Majlis has sanctioned orders being placed in America for equipment for the army up to a limit of 2,100,000 dollars, and for the gendarmerie up to a limit of 2,400,000 dollars. This is to cover equipment recommended as necessary by the American advisers to the army and the gendarmerie. The principal items for the army are motor transport, tyres and spares, signalling equipment, medical, veterinary, engineering and office stores, clothing and equipment; and for the gendarmerie motor transport, motor cycles, signalling equipment, clothing and equipment. 8. The Military Service Bill (see Sum mary No. 27/42 paragraph 5) has been passed by the Majlis after much deliberation ancTargument. The final text is not yet available. A ppointments — Military. 9. Sarhang Faridunfar to be Commander of the Gendarmerie in Khorassan. 7 .. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. J 10. A demonstration against high prices and the alleged shortage of bread was made recently at the offices of the Governor-General in Tabriz. There is ground for suspicion that it was staged by the Governor-General himself with the object of discrediting the American representative of the Ministry of Food and of getting permission from the Government to undertake himself the feeding of the town by purchases on the black market to the benefit of himself and his brother-landlords.Western A zerbaijan. 11 The Kurds are still opposing the establishment of gendarmerie posts in w they regard as Kurdish territory. In one instance, after a fight had occurred between Kurds and gendarmes, the Soviet Consul accompanied the eisian commander and persuaded the Kurds to allow the establishment of the post. Fars. 12. General Shahbakhti sent a summons to Nasir Qashgai to come to Shiraz, guaranteeing him safety and a fair hearing. Nasir has, as usual, played tor time, asking for three weeks’ delay to allow him to consult other chiefs with in he had sworn alliance. The Government’s instructions to General Shahbakhti are that he is to commence operations for the occupation of Frruzabad without further* parleying with Nasir. General Shahbakhti is, however, still immobile for lack of transport for this operation and for the protection of the 183 miles of road from Bushire to Shiraz. Meanwhile, Nasir has again wired to certain members of the Government and the Majlis warning them that all the tribes of Kuh-i-Galu and Fars were ready to rise to defend themselves against the Government forces and that he was no longer able to hold them back. 1 his created some alarm among those with property in Fars, but it is believed that the Government was not persuaded to alter its policy. Of the tribes specifically mentioned by Nasir as being on the point of rising, the Mamassani are reliably reported to have sent messages signed by seven of their khans representing the three sections to Shahbakhti to assure him of their loyalty, and Hussein Quli Rustami, of the same tribe, who is to some extent an outlaw, has also made overtures of submission. Persian Baluchistan. 13. In the recent drive for collection of arms from lawless tribes in Mekran about 450 rifles were confiscated, of which about half were -303 and German Mausers and the remainder Martinis and muzzle-loaders. Russian Affairs. 14. For some time past the Russians have been showing increasing dislike of the presence of British and Americans in Azerbaijan. The Americans have found much reluctance on the part of the Russians to allow American transport organisations to operate in the Russian zone. The American representative in Tabriz of the Ministry of Food, who during his stay there was not given even a pretence of support by the Russians, has now had to leave, having been informed that the period of his permit had expired. 15. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that there is a considerable and increasing congestion at the railway enclosure of supplies brought to Tabriz by road for Russia, due apparently to lack of rail transport for its onward journey. This congestion is likely to grow worse as conditions improve on the road from Kazvin to Tabriz; they have latterly been so bad owing to heavy snow as to limit to a considerable degree the flow of road transport. Supplies are now also reaching Kazvin faster than the Russians can clear them, so that an accumulation is piling up there also. 16. A Persian paper which is supported by the Soviet Embassy has recently been making statements whose object appears to be to give credit to Russia at the expense of Great Britain. For example, it challenged the suggestion made by another paper that credit should be given to the B.B.C. for inspiring the present alleged struggle between progressives and reactionaries. Again, in an article suggesting that British and American post-war policy might lead to an extension of the system of mandates to include countries like Persia, the paper expresses relief that Soviet Russia is one of the signatories of the Tripartite Alliance, since she had consistently shown good feeling towards the Persian people, and by her actions of the past twenty-five years and through the speeches of Stalin had convinced the Persian people of the Soviet’s concern for the independence of Persia. These sentiments may not have been inspired by the Soviet Embassy; their expression may be due merely to the editor's wish to earn his subsidy. This paper frequently sympathises with Russia on the absence of a second front. 17. On the Zahidan-Meshed route the U.K.C.C. are now operating about 550 trucks and are capable of delivering at Meshed some 6,000 tons monthly for Russia.|b?f w ^ a THIS DOCUMENT IS PT TH^ I [PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

THE New Year holidays covered most of the last week, with the result that there was little political activity. On the other hand, there was little of the usual light-hearted festivity, and indeed the poor had little cause to be festive. Unusually sustained heavy rain in Tehran had demolished a number of the mud houses in the poor quarters of the town, oil was still scarce, bread none too plentiful, and everything in the way of pleasures far beyond the reach of the poor. The press took the opportunity to stress the hardships Persia was suffering from Allied exploitation. The Shah and the Prime Minister broadcast to the nation. The Shah confined himself to good wishes, pious hopes for the future, an exhortation to be patriotic and brave, and an expression of his conviction that the products of industry and agriculture should be more evenly divided. The Prime Minister’s speech had more meat. He stressed that Persia could not hope to escape some inevitable hardships of war or to preserve unchanged the conditions of peace. Persia must be prepared to make sacrifices with her Allies, and the individual to surrender some of his liberty, as all in the great democracies had willingly submitted to severe restrictions. Agitators, hoarders, speculators and all those trying to turn the conditions produced by the war to their personal profit were enemies of the country. The well-being of Persia lay in strengthening ties with Great Britain and Russia, and those who attempted to create discord were acting against the interests of Persia. Persia, he claimed, had given great assistance to the plans of the Allies, but she would not get the reward she had earned unless she went the whole way in co-operation with the Allies. He was now making plans to ensure food supplies, to reduce prices, prevent hoarding and improve order and security. The broadcast should have a good effect on those who believe that the Prime Minister is capable of sincerity. Economic. 2. Grain has been reaching Tehran in sufficient quantities to maintain minimum requirements of bread. During the first seven days of March the amount of imported grain that reached Tehran was 687 tons of wheat, 48 of barley and 14 of millet, and of local grain 219 tons of wheat and 31 of barley. The bad condition of roads resulting from heavy rain and snow has seriously affected collections of grain. Kermanshah had on the 26th March less than a week’s supply and required 2,000 tons from other sources than its own to make up the deficit till next harvest. In Shiraz the deficit is estimated at 2,500 tons. 3. Dr. Millspaugh has caused consternation by announcing that he intends to balance his budget for the coming year. This will require both drastic cutting down of expenditure and a heavy increase of taxation, as in the year now ended expenditure greatly exceeded revenue, the deficit having been made up by borrowing from the National Bank.

If Dr. Millspaugh has his way regarding the balancing of the budget^* (see paragraph 3 above), General Ridley and Colonel Schwarzkopf will have to s recast their schemes for the reorganisation of the army and the gendarmerie Dr. Millspaugh is at present saying that the maximum provision that will be available for the army is the sum sanctioned in the last budget, viz., 700 million rials. Internal Security. Pars. 6. Action in Ears by General Shahbakhti still hangs fire owing to his lack of transport. The delay not only adds to the difficulties of achieving a satis factory settlement, but is damaging to the already low' prestige of the Government. British prestige is also now affected since it is now well known that His Majesty's Legation has pressed for the elimination of Nasir. that assistance was promised by British military authorities, and that a liaison officer representing General Headquarters, Persia - and Iraq Force is in Shiraz, who the people of Fars are beginning to say is there to endeavour to ensure that British policy is carried out. The prolonged winter may have delayed the migration of the tribes, but they are likely soon to be on the move and insecurity may increase. 7. Nasir Qashgai’s cousin, Amir Hussein Salar Afkham, whose father at various times replaced Nasir’s father as Ilkhani of the Qashgai, is supporting General Shahbakhti, and is using his influence to separate the sub-tribes from Nasir. He recently told His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz that the Kalantars of the Darashuri had recently assured him that they disassociated themselves from any activities against the Government and promised their support to Shahbakhti. Salar Afkham’s family suffered considerably from the hands of Nasir’s father, and they are very hostile to Nasir, as is his uncle AH Khan Salar Hishmat. Dashti and Tangistan. 8. Dissensions have broken out among the khans of Dashti and Tangistan. This is no unusual condition. It is not inopportune at the moment as it should prevent any effective support of Nasir Qashgai. Western Azerbaijan. 9. His Majesty’s Consul-General reports an incident that is probably the same as that mentioned in Summary No. 12/43, paragraph 11. His information is that a band of about 400 Shekak Kurds surrounded the village of Kahriz intending to loot.

Tehran, April 6. 1943. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 14 for the Period March 31 to April 6, 1943. Persian A (fairs. Political. THE atmosphere is disturbed. The Government has shown no firmness in dealing with the agitator or with a very subversive press, although a few of the worst papers have been suppressed. The discontent of the lower classes is being fanned; the Tudeh party continues to acquire adherents; and there is anxiety lest the agitation should lead to strikes and sabotage by workers and peasants. New political parties are springing up, usually claiming to represent 1 youth and the working classes, and the Government has felt obliged to authorise ; the Military Governor to prohibit all political meetings in Tehran. Criticism of the British in the press and in popular talk continues; and a rather bitter attack was made in the Majlis, which was, however, well answered by Tadayyun, the Minister of Food. 2. There is reported to be a split in the Tudeh party, one section following the original founder, Abbas Iskandari, and dissentients being led by his son, Iraj Iskandari, and Suleiman Mirza. The latter section is said to object to the inclusion in the party programme of a statement to the effect that the party is national and has as one of its objects the preservation of the independence of Persia. 3. The Queen Mother and the Princess Shams (sister of the Shah) have returned from their visit to Egypt. Economic. 4. Dr. Millspaugh’s first monthly report is of interest. In a review of Persian economy in recent years he notes the decline of agriculture, the excessive urbanisation, the lack of progress in hygiene, the extravagant growth of administrative organisations resulting in a spendthrift expenditure, and the gradual demoralisation of character that resulted from all power and initiative being in the hands of a few. On the other hand, he gives credit fdr the construction of railways and roads, the development of commerce and the foundation of national industries. In commenting on the rise in the cost of living he points out that it is due only in part to the inflation caused by the heavy expenditure of the Allies in rials; it is also due to unbalanced budgets, which necessitated heavy borrowings by the Government from the National Bank; to the weakness of the Government, which, on the one hand, occasioned a lack of confidence in the cover for the note issue, and, on the other, took no adequate measures for the stabilisation of prices; and to speculation and hoarding. The indebtedness of the Government in January 1943 was 3,400 million rials, whereas in March 1942 it had been less than 2J million. The revenue during the first nine months of the Persian year 1321 (the 21st March, 1942-20th March. 1943) showed a decrease of 672 million rials in comparison with the same period of [41-8] €&gt;/ ^-&gt;~0 sj ZJJmmm 2 \ the ^previous year, while for the same periods expenditure showed an increase of 590 million rials. The measures which he proposed to advise as remedies were :— from (a) Stabilisation of prices and rationing of necessities of life. (b) Revision of taxes with a view to withdrawing paper currency circulation and reducing the deficit in the budget. ( c ) Reduction of national expenditure and cessation of borrowing from the National Bank. (d) Development of agriculture and industry. 4 (e) Increase of imports as far as transport would allow. (/) 1 he more equitable distribution of imported goods. (y) Sale of the State lands. (h) Importation of gold. (?) Sale of metal coin against paper money. 5. 1 he bread situation in Tehran has eased. Supplies of imported grain are reaching the town, as are also supplies from the provinces, as a result of improved transport conditions and the offer of higher prices by the Government. The Food Department has now some four-five days’ reserves in hand. Items of Interest. 6. typhus, which is endemic in Tehran, has now become epidemic on a serious scale. No accurate figure of the number of cases is obtainable, but it is estimated at from 15,000 to 30,000. The Persian Government finds itself short of hospital accommodation and equipment, and improvised hospitals are being- set up in various Government and Royal buildings, and the Majlis has'sanctioned I a credit of 5 million rials for necessary expenses. The Commander-in-chief, Persia and Iraq Force, has authorised the use of an Indian General Hospital for Persian typhus patients. There are less serious epidemics at Kerman, Zahidan, Meshed and other towns of Persia. 7. An aii craft of the 1 ersian Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, flying on the legular mail service Irom Bagdad to I eh ran, crash-landed between Khanakin and Kermanshah.

Internal Security. Western A zerbaijan. 9. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul in Tabriz, who recently toured in Western Azerbaijan, reports that there is considerable anxiety lest the Kurds should this spi mg repeat their depredations of last year. They are buying arms wherever they can with the large profits made from the sale of grain' in Iraq and on the black market m Persia. They oppose the establishment of posts of Persian gendarmerie m tribal territory, but in some cases have been forced by Russian pressure to agree. They have been raiding across the Turkish frontier and in one raul carried off 2,000 sheep, of which 200 were recovered and returned by the Russians. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul is of opinion that, if the Russians make plain their disapproval of Kurdish lawlessness, serious disorder this sprino- need not be* feared. r 5 Fars. 10. The situation remains quiet and no information has yet been received that General Shahbakhti has yet made any effective move against Nasir Oash'uii The nature of the problem has already changed with the arrival of spring Those Persians who favour strong measures against Nasir are now being accused of being unpatriotic pawns of British policy. ° Bakhtiari. fU report has been received that Abul Qasim and his followers have forced the evacuation of a Persian military post at Izeh (Malamir) The delay m dealing with the situation in Fars is having a bad effect on the tribal situation everywhere in South Persia.• c Russian Affairs.

Soviet influence in Persia is attached to this summary. .. ^*- ls Majesty’s Vice-Consul in Tabriz recently visited Western Azerbaijan and gained the impression that the Russians were now regretting -j^ie encouragement they had given to the Kurds in the early days of their ^cupation. 1 hey were now appreciating the necessity for settled conditions in Western Azerbaijan and for the maximum production of food-stuffs. They were not, however, willing to allow the Persian Government to maintain adequate forces in that area for the maintenance of order and limited even the size of posts^ But they were using their moral influence to assist the Persians to keep the Kurds in order, and on more than one occasion they had demonstrated their support of the Persian authorities by sending Russian officers to accompany Persian officers to insist on the Kurds complying with Persian demands. They are suspicious of any indication of British influence among the Kurds of Western Azerbaijan, and the suggestion that a man is a British agent is enough to ensure his arrest. A merican Interests. 15. A.n Irano-American Society has been formed for the encouragement of social relations. The president is Hassan Isfandiari, the President of the Majlis, and the vice-president is the American Minister. Polish Affairs. 16. The number of civilian Polish refugees still in Persia is :— In Tehran : 10,971 men, women and children. Isfahan : 1.911 men, women and children. Ahwaz : 3,971 men, women and children. Total : 16,853 men, women and children. Soviet Influence in Persia. 1. There has been recently a very noticeable change in the sentiments of the Persian people towards Russia. Closer contact with Russians and experience in Russian methods have already done much to modify the conception, hitherto popular among the masses, of Russia as a bogy and of Russians as brutal savages. The generally admirable discipline of Russian troops in Persia, their good behaviour towards the people, their professed sympathy with the lower classes, their advertised contentment with their own system, the good relations apparently existing between officers and men and the obviously magnificent morale of the Russian people have greatly affected preconceived ideas of the Soviet system. The Russians are at pains to bring to the notice of the Persian people their cultural activities. There are in Tehran two well-stocked Russian bookshops, where Russian classical and modern literature, technical hand books, newspapers and pamphlets can be obtained, and a permanent exhibition showing pictures of cultural interest, and having also a reading-room. Somewhat similar centres exist in Tabriz and Meshed. Russian films are also much in evidence in Tehran and provincial towns. An increasingly sympathetic interest is being shown in the principles of the Soviet system, and a courageous few even dare to advocate the adoption in Persia of some at least of its practice. This is the more noticeable in that communism is generally repugnant to the Persian people, both poor and rich. 2. The less frightful Russia is to the masses the more of a bogy does she become to the propertied classes. A situation seems to be developing where the masses may draw closer to Russia and the propertied classes come to be associated more closely than they now are with Great Britain. Indeed, Russia is already beginning to be regarded as the champion of the oppressed and is being looked to bv &amp; the leaders of the discontented as a possible supporter of a revolution against the present ruling classes. The Russians, so the legend goes, have prevented the British removing food-stuffs from the provinces occupied by Russian troops; there the peasants have plenty; in those parts of Persia unfortunately deprived of Russian influence the poor are starving, while the British put large sums into the pockets of contractors, who exploit the worker and corner the people's food for sale to the British for consumption or export. That the Russians also consume and export considerable quantities of local produce has little effect on Persians■wm 1 ii.,iwai 4 outside the Russian zone, since there is alleged to be sufficient left for the people of their zone; and the fact that the usual surpluses from the Northern Provinces have not reached Tehran this year is blamed by the public more on the alleged British monopoly of civilian transport than on Russian obstructiveness. There is, however, reason to believe that the people living in the Russian zone are not so convinced of their good fortune as Russian propaganda would lead others to believe. 3. It would be unreasonable to suppose that the spread of these ideas i^ displeasing to the Russians or that they do not give them discreet encouragemeir Whatever post-war objects the Russians have in view, it is unlikely that they will deliberately forgo the opportunity of paving the way foi* an increase of their political influence in Persia, even if it is only as a defensive measure against the spread of British influence, that the Russians remain intensely suspicious of British (and American) designs in North Persia, and even possibly in the Caucasus, seems to be indicated by their recent request for an explanation of our construction of landing grounds in North and East Persia, by the increasing difficulty experienced in obtaining passes for British officers to visit Azerbaijan, b\ their refusal to allow the Americans to operate convoys in the Russian zone and by the gradual extension southwards, although not as yet to any great extent, of their military posts. It might be unwise to interpret other Russian moves’ such as the reopening of consulates in South and East Persia, their recon naissance of the^ Perso-Afghan frontier, their recent scientific expedition of investigation in South-West Persia, their opposition to the grant of authority to American advisers in Persian administrations, the contract for the manufacture ot arms whereby Russia may acquire a partial control of certain factories and industries, the increasing interest they are taking in economic, political and tribal conditions in Central and South Persia, as steps in a far-reaching political plan; there are other reasonable explanations. But there is little doubt that the position of Russia in Persia after the war is likely to be considerably more advanced, much more closely in contact with important British interests, such as India, the Persian Gulf and the Anglo-Persian oil-fields, than before the war. 4. Conditions in Persia to-day are such that the masses will incline towards anyone who appears to sympathise with their sufferings; there is a growing dis content among the lower classes against the landowners and the masters of industry; the contrast between rich and poor is increasingly shameful; in most of the towns the conditions of the lower classes is appalling, lacking food, clothing, medicines and education; in many rural districts it is not much better. Russia is credited with sympathy for the masses; Great Britain is accused of callousness towards their sufferings. Persians have undoubtedly suffered from the Allies’ utilisation of the country’s communications, from their large demands for currency and from their purchases of food-stuffs, and that being so it has not been difficult to persuade the mass of the people that all their ills are the effect of the actions of the Allies. But, somehow, Russia escapes much of the blame. Con ditions are lelatively better in the Russian zone, which is, in any case, small compared with the rest of Persia, which sees only British and American control; it is Great Britain who restricts imports and controls the railway that should bring goods and oil from the Gulf; it is the U.K.C.C. who monopolises the civil transport m the greater part of Persia, It is the British.Minister who has had to take the lead m bringing pressure on the Persian Government to satisfy Allied demands. 5. Great Britain is, consequently, probably more unpopular than she has ever been before. It would be unjustifiable to assume that Russia does not benefit from this unpopularity or that she fails to encourage comparisons unfavourable to Great Britain between the Russian and the British attitude towards the people. What is even more galling is that the behaviour of Russian troops in Persia should be contrasted favourably with that of British, and that in Tehran the British should have acquired a reputation for arrogance. Respect and awe of the Russians are increased by the fulsome praise of the British press. 6. Britain’s unpopularity does not, however, prevent British influence from being very strong in Persia to-day. Britain is regarded by the majority of the middle and upper classes as the only real hope of post-war salvation. Some, at least, of them are conscious that the present economic distress is to some extent due to the inefficiency and corruption of the governing and propertied classes and are beginning to realise that the time has come when greater consideration must be shown to the condition of the masses.

Tehran, A pril 13, 1943. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 15 for the Period April 7-13, 1943. Political. Persian Affairs. THE Government remains timorous and indecisive, showing no inclination to take the drastic steps which are necessary to solve the problems with which it is beset, irresolute before the criticism and opposition that any drastic measure must inevitably arouse, anxious not to incur the opposition of vested interests in the Majlis, confused by many advisers. It hesitates to authorise the Military Governor of Tehran to take action against the press; it has aroused doubts of its intention to re-establish its effective authority in Fars in particular and in the [tribal areas in general; it fears to press on the Majlis its Bill for the grant of [special powers to Dr. Millspaugh (see Summary No. 11/43, paragraph 8). 2. The opposition to forcible action being taken against Nasir Qashgai grows and gains adherents. The impression is being created that the Persian ^ Government is being pushed into this action against its judgment by the British Legation, and some members of the Government are not above the suspicion of encouraging this impression. Those who publicly uphold the necessity fot* action are accused of being paid puppets of the British. They are not all unaffected by the accusation. 3. Criticism and abuse of British policy has abated. The press has generally adopted a more moderate tone, probably as a result of warnings from the Prime Minister that he would be unable to resist much longer the demands of the British Legation for the suppression of offending papers. Economic. 4. The latest reliable estimates of the amounts of imported cereals required to make up deficiencies in certain provincial areas up to the next harvest are as follows 7 W Bushire and Bandar Shiraz ... Yazd Kerman Khorramabad ... Abbas 150 1,500 500 500 1,000 Estimates for Sultanabad, Hamadan and Kermanshah cannot be made until it is known how much can still be produced from adjacent areas. In Kermanshah stocks are low and 1,000 tons must be produced from somewhere in the near future. In Tehran the situation is easier for the time being, 3,100 tons having- been imported by rail during the fortnight subsequent to the 21st March, in addition to small supplies from Gurgan, whence 1,200 tons have been received in the past six weeks. An unexpected promise from the Russians to import 25,000 tons of wheat via the Caspian ports for the use of Tehran has greatly relieved anxiety. BECo. PCI.

W Fars. Internal Security. (. Military action against Nasir Qashgai is still being delayed on one pretext or another. There is little doubt that General Shahbakhti has been affected by the suggestion that is gaining ground, that the Government is being shaken by the opposition of irresponsible Deputies in its determination to secure the submission of Nasir by force if necessary. The elimination of Nasir is now being represented as a British rather than a Persian interest. The tribes have no doubt been informed of the apparent hesitation of the Persian Government and I encouraged to show a bold front against foreign interference. The Bushire- ■] road, the security of which is the principal British interest, remains undis- tuibed except by minor incidents, and General Shahbakhti now says that, since the ti ibes are now on the move, it would be unwise to start operations until he has sufficient motor-vehicles to ensure the safety of the road bv patrolling. The problem before the Persian Government of re-establishing control over the tribes of the south grows more difficult the longer action is postponed. The incident at Izeh referred to in paragraph 8 below is an indication of the deterioration in the situation since tne good effect of Shahbakhti’s assumption of responsibility began to wear off as a result of protracted inaction. Bakhtiari. 8. No further developments of importance have been reported since the ejection of the Persian garrison from Izeh. The Ministry of War has issued orders that the situation is to be restored without delay, but this will not. necessarily ensure prompt local action. Unless action is taken without undue delay other tribes of the south are likely to be encouraged in their intransigence Khuzestan. 9. The diversion caused by the Bakhtiari and Bahmai exploit at Izeh has postponed the measures that were in train for the collection of arms from the eni tunif It had appeared that the Beni Turuf would be willing to surrender some at least of their anus without resisting.

Little progress has been made with any Government business. The Bill for the insurance of workmen (see Summa ry No. 1/4 3. paragraph 3) passed the first reading in commission. The Bill for the grant of extensive executive powers 2m to the American Financial Adviser (see Summary No. 11/ 43, paragraph 8) has been debated by Parliamentary Commissions, but has not yet returned to the Majlis. Soheily is running true to form; prophecies of the early fall of his Government are common, even by Ministers, and various parties are already selecting, and working up support for, the next Prime Minister. Seyyid Zia ed Pin labatabai, Muhammad Said, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Ali Mansur (F.O. 120; M.A. 164), the present Governor-General of Khorassan, all have their supporters. 2. The Minister without Portfolio. Hussein Sami’i, has been given the task of investigating all complaints against Government employees. He will not lack occupation. The Press. 3. The Prime Minister's attempts to control the press by reasonable persuasion have not been successful, even though he went so far as to tell the press that he was satisfied that there was no foundation for the reports that the British had burned wheat and sheep. The moderation reported last week did not last long. Remarks made to journalists by the Minister of State regarding the aid given by Britain to Persia and the necessity for Persians to do more to help themselves called forth impertinent counter-attacks from some papers. Criticism of the behaviour of British and Indian (and American) soldiers and comparison with the model Russian continue, and some papers found occasion for violent outbursts in the killing by Indian troops in the vicinity of Tehran of five Persians caught stealing British telephone wire and attempting to escape This incident has considerably excited public feeling. On the other hand, the adulation of Russia and Russian troops continues, and the offer bv the Soviet Ambassador of 25,000 tons of wheat for Tehran reported in last week’s Summarv * (No. 15/43) provoked an outburst of mawkish sycophancy. Economic. 4. Although there are now reserves of wheat for a few days in Tehran issues of bread have been insufficient to go round, and queues for bread (and oil) are still a daily feature. In Shiraz and Kermanshah the situation is still [41—45]2 critical. Of the 25,000 tons of wheat offered by the Russians for Tehran, 10,000 tons have been promised for delivery early in May. 5. The engineers of the Ministries of Agriculture and of Industries and Mines have struck for more pay. A ppointments — Civil. 6—(i) Dr. Misbahzadeh, to be Director of the Press and Propaganda ^ ^ Department. . . (ii) Mustafa Sami’h to be Head of the Protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (iii) Dr. Ali Akhbar Daftari, to be Counsellor at the Persian Legation in Washington. (iv) Muhsin Rais (F.O. 172; M.A. 239), to be Persian Consul-General in India. Persian Forces. 7. The mission of Persian officers that visited the Middle East Command (see Summary No. 11/43, paragraph 13) has returned, very well pleased with their visit and much impressed with what they saw. there is no doubt that the visit has had a good effect and that it' has served a ^ useful purpose. ^ A tentative request has already been made by the Chief of the General Staff that Persian officers should be allowed to attend some of the courses of instruction held in the Middle East Command. Evidence of what British officers had achieved in the administration of the Egyptian army has inclined the officers of this mission more favourably towards giving authority to an American Mission. Internal Security. Fars. Mllllavu &lt;3 pci . . 8. It now appears that General Shahbakhti is unlikely to take direct action ' ’ , A yi' ^e^'jagainst Nasir. The time has passed when Nasir could be dealt with separately 2 /rTrom the main body of the tribes, and the Persian forces in Fars are neither strong enough nor mobile enough to deal effectively with a situation where the opposition of the Qashgai tribe as a whole is provoked; particularly having regard to the freedom of movement the tribes have in the summer. He is perhaps right in his appreciation that if he were to embark on offensive operations now it would lead to disorder he could not control and to insecurity on the road. He still talks of disarming the tribes, but it is doubtful whether he is likely to carry that to the point where it would provoke the hostilities that both sides are anxious to avoid. If a consistent policy were followed a fair measure of Government control could probably be established over the Qashgai by progressive stages without arousing more opposition than the Persian forces could overcome. Various chiefs, including the Kalantars of the Mamassani and Dushmanziari, continue to give assurances to His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz that they do not wish to act against the interests of the British and Persian Governments. For the time being the security of the road is satisfactory. Bakhtiari. 9. No developments have been reported of the Izeh incident referred to in Summary No. 14/43, paragraph 11. It now appears doubtful whether Abul Qasim Bakhtiari was there. According to a letter he had written to the Persian authorities at Isfahan he was at Ardal, and strongly disapproved of the rebellious action of the tribesmen concerned. Khuzestan. 10. Up to the 9th April, when the attention of the Persian military authori ties in Khuzestan was diverted from the Arabs to the situation at Izeh, 42 rifles had been handed over by the Beni Turuf. British Affairs. 11. The Minister of State visited Tehran from the 13th to 17th April. 12. For months past serious inconvenience has been caused to British military communications in Persia by repeated thefts, amounting in all to a very considerable amount, of telephone wire. As it has always been British C 41wire, and never Persian wire, even when hung on the same poles, deliberate sabotage is suspected. Repeated requests have been made to the Persian authorities to ensure tne protection of British communications, but the nuisance has increased rather than abated. Where possible, British or Indian troops have patrolled the wire and have caught several thieves red-handed. On the loth April at Tehran, a party of Persians was caught in the act of removing wire and five ot the party were killed by Indian troops when trying to escape. he hostile press has done its best to excite public opinion against Indian troops over this and other alleged incidents. Russian Affairs. 13. The meeting of the ludeh party to inaugurate its election campaign in Meshed was attended by the local representative of the Soviet Propaganda Department. In Isfahan, too, where the Tudeh party is very active, the Russian Consulate is interesting itself in the approaching elections; and Shiraz was recently visited by the chief representative in Persia of the Foreign Cultural Relations Section of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by a representative of the Press and Propaganda Department of the Soviet Embassy. There are reports that Russian officials are now taking an interest in British relations with the Qashgai. This, if true, should give Nasir Qashgai an opportunity of offering his loyalty to a third European Power. Czechoslovak Affairs. 14. M.

THE evil effects of the outrageous conduct of the press on Anglo-Persian relations and on the internal. situation and the increasing indiscipline in all Government departments that was obviously resulting from the unrestricted license of the press to criticise the Government and to incite and inflame public opinion have at last convinced the Prime Minister that action was necessary. By a decree of the Council of Ministers, the Government transferred to the Minister for War full authority for the execution of article 5 of the Military Governorship Law, which sanctions the arrest and detention of persons suspected of opposition to constitutional government or public order and security. By another decree the Government has amplified the rather vague article which describes the offences for which newspapers may be suppressed. These are now defined as : the publication of articles contemptuously criticising decisions made by Government in the interests of law and order or to assure the necessary requirements of the people; incitement against Government by improper and insulting publications concerning the Crown, or the legislative executive and judicial bodies of the country; criticism of, and false accusations against, foreign representatives of Governments in alliance with or in friendly relations with the Persian Government when such publications would be damaging to the interests of the Persian Government. 2. The Minister for War has been obliged himself to assume the functions of the Military Governor, all other officers to whom the appointment was offered having pleaded that they were unwilling to be accused of suppressing the liberties of the people. This attitude is typical of the lack of confidence of all Govern ment employees in the Government’s ability to protect them against attack by the press and of the prevailing indiscipline that has resulted from the weakness of Soheily's Administration. The Minister for War does not lack courage, and he has issued a communique announcing that he intends to apply to the letter the laws and regulations of military governorship. He has already suppressed eleven newspapers in Tehran, but since papers are not subject to censorship before publication, offensive articles continue to appear and to circulate before the papers can be suppressed. 3. An attempt was made to work up an agitation against the Bill for the grant of extensive powers to the American Financial Adviser (see Summary No. 11/43, paragraph 8) by closing the bazaars. This coincided with the assumption by the Minister for War of the authority of the Military Governor of Tehran. The bazaars were open the next day, the merchants all fervently denying that they had instigated the movement, and the shopkeepers saying that they had shut their shops on rumours that rioting was imminent. The Chamber [41—‘50] i i Iof Commerce bad since issued a statement denying, on behalf of the merchants it represents, the rumours that the merchants were instigating opposition to the grant of powers to Dr. Millspaugh. The Bill in question has passed the first reading. 4. The Prime Minister issued a communique in reasonably firm terms justifying the Bill for the grant of special powers to Dr. Millspaugh on the grounds that effective measures could not be taken against the speculators and^* hoarders who were in part responsible for the present critical economic situation unless extensive powers were centralised in the hands of an impartial and experienced man. The communique also defines the Government's attitude towards the press. It states that, while not wishing to obstruct the expression of legitimate criticism or the enlightenment of public opinion, the Government has decided that it is necessary to put an end to the anarchy of the press that was creating anxiety and disunity among the people, provoking disorder and injuring the relations of the Government with its allies. The Prime Minister spoilt the effect of this communique by pleading in a secret session of the Majlis that he had been forced to agree to the suppression of certain newspapers by the pressure brought on him bv the British Minister. Economic. 5. The Government has now announced that it intends to claim the whole of the landlords’ surplus of the next harvest, and that the price to be paid is 3,000 rials per ton for wheat, except in the frontier regions, where the price will later be fixed in relation to the price prevailing in neighbouring countries. The price to he paid for barley and millet will be three-quarters of the price of wheat. 6. Harvesting of barley has now begun in Khuzestan and some parts of the Gulf littoral. No measures for control of the harvest have yet been instituted by the Central Government and it is likely to disappear into speculators' hoards unless prompt steps are taken. 7. The Majlis has sanctioned a credit of 45 million rials for the construction of irrigation works during the vear 1943-44. A ypointments — Civil. 8.

The complete looting of a village in Ears by the Galehzan, one of the smaller sub-tribes of the Qashgai, has been reported by General Shahbakhti, who attributes this new outbreak of brigandage not to his own inaction, but to the encouragement of the Qashgai by the Tehran press and some of the Deputies. Shortly previous to this he had telegraphed his resignation on the grounds that the Government's failure to suppress press attacks on himself and on the policy he had been instructed to execute and the support given openly by press and Deputies to Nasir Qashgai had unsettled his forces, encouraged the tribes to combine and made his task impossible. He has reluctantly consented to remain in Ears for the present, but there is no doubt that his task is now very much more difficult and that a much greater degree of unity has been established between the Qashgai, the Kuh-i-Galu tribes and the Bakhtiari. A reliable informant who has recently visited Abul Qasim Bakhtiari was shown by the latter a letter recently received from Nasir Qashgai telling him that the tribal leaders had only to stand together and the Government would give up its intentions of establishing authority over the tribes. 10. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire reports that a column of 500 Persian troops has arrived in Bushire for the purpose of disarming the tribes of Dashti and Tangistan. This is a very necessary operation, but whether General Shahbakhti will really carry it out effectively in his present mood seems uncertain. Bakhtiari. 11. From Izeh (see Summary No. 14/43, paragraph 11) Jancki Bakhtiari and Bahmai tribesmen advanced to Qaleh-i-Tul, where they surrounded the garrison, whose fate is not yet known. Relieving columns of insufficient strength were sent out from Ram Hormuz, but made no progress and may have suffered heavy casualties. The incident has been handled with more than usual Persianinefficiency. The responsibility for dealing with it lay with General Shahbakhti, who was sulking and belittled its seriousness. The General Staff in Tehran considered that the possibilities of troubles in Tehran prevented the despatch of troops from the local garrison. Contradictory orders regarding the despatch of reinforcements from other garrisons were sent by the General Staff and General Shahbakhti. Meanwhile, the tribal forces have increased and the difficulties of the Persian Government have increased. 12. From the evidence now available it seems that the initial movement was instigated by Abul Qasim Bakhtiari. He has now withdrawn from active leader ship and has recently stated to a reliable informant that his object was only to make a gesture to prevent Persian troops interfering with the upward migration of the tribes and that the further actions of the tribes were contrary to his wishes. He is now again offering to come to terms with Government, but the terms are to be his own. Khuzestan. 13. Tp to the time when Persian forces had to be withdrawn from the neighbourhood of the Meni Turuf, 250 rifles had been collected from this tribe. Lure stan. 14. The Ministry for War states that 211 rifles have recently been collected from the Papi and Piranvand tribes, and that another 590 rifles, which had been handed over to Bakshdars and local officials, have also been withdrawn. Russian Affairs. 15. The Soviet Press Bureau has announced that the Russian military medical services in Persia have been instructed to assist the Persian health services to the greatest possible extent in the prevention of the spread of epidemics. Ten centres will be established at places in the Russian zone for the free vaccination and inoculation, and four sanitary groups equipped with disinfectors and bath units will be set up at Semnan, Sari, Gurgan and Meshed to deal with epidemics. A further extension of this work is promised and a free supply of serums and disinfectants on a liberal scale. This is the Russian counter-move to the opening of a British military hospital to Persian typhus patients. 16. Another aspect of Russian methods in Persia is reported by His Majesty’s Consul-General in Tabriz. The Russians have recently undertaken to supply the Tabriz market with petrol and oils. They are also contracting for the supply to them of leather from the local tanning factories and are offering 77 rials per kilogramme, whereas the factory cost of production is 84 rials per kilogramme. The Russians have hinted plainly that, unless the contract is concluded at their price, the factory can expect no kerosine, gas-oil or petrol. 17. A report requiring confirmation has been received that the Russians are constructing a landing ground in the vicinity of Fariman, 50 miles south by east of Meshed. • Tehran, 2§th A pril, 1943.FILE COPY T HI S DOCUM EN T IS THE PROPER TY OF HIS BRITAN NIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT f ??)

Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 18 for the period 21th April to ?&gt;rd May. 1943. Political. Persian Affairs. THERE has been a slight stiffening of the attitude of the Government. Further papers have been suppressed; the first five articles of the Bill for the grant of powers to Dr. Millspaugh have passed the second reading in the Majlis; overt agitation against Government action against the Qashgai has ceased, indeed articles have appeared in the press calling attention to the failure of the Govern ment to protect the people of Ears against their depredations; and the turbulent Deputy Nowbakht has been suspended from the Majlis for seven days for an unparliamentary attack on the Minister for War. But there is no cause yet for rejoicing. Only continual urging saves the Prime Minister from giving way to vested interests. Laxity and corruption in all administrations throughout* the country have reached an unprecedented degree. The cost of living has risen to such heights that Government employees, including army officers, on small fixed incomes must either steal of starve. Indiscipline is common in all Government departments, and noticeably bad in the army. 2 . Due to fear of the Military Governor, political party meetings are less active in Tehran. The Tudeh party wished to stage a demonstration on the 1 st May, but was forbidden to do so by the Military Governor. It is understood that Abbas Iskandari, who was reported in Summary No. 14/43, paragraph 2 . to be leading one section of the Tudeh party, has now been deserted by his followers. Economic. 3. The critical period for Tehran's bread supply appears to have passed. 1,400 tons of grain reached Tehran by rail and road in the five days preceding the 26th April, and there is now a reserve for eight days. The Russians have undertaken to deliver at the Caspian ports 7,500 tons of wheat per month, beginning towards the end of May, until their promise of 25,000 tons is fulfilled' In certain provincial towns there is still shortage and much profiteering on the j black market, but everywhere there are prospects of a bumper harvest. A Govern ment commission has gone to Khuzestan to arrange for the collection of the harvest, which is already being reaped. In the provinces of Ears and Isfahan much of the wheat-growing areas are now in the control of rebel tribal chiefs, and unless military operations are undertaken to re-establish Government authority in those areas, it is unlikely that much of their wheat will reach the Government stores. 4. It is understood that Dr. Millspaugh is faced with a serious situation in regard to the current year’s budget, and that after making all possible economies he finds himself faced with a deficit of not less than 600 million rials on the ordinary budget. In addition, he has to find an increase of at least 300 million E ' 41 ” 60] A- ^2 rials for the army. He must also find 645 million rials during the first three months for the purchase of the wheat crop, 310 million for the Persian munition factories under contract to the Russians, 100 million for a canning factory (also working for the Russians), 46 million for purchases of cotton/ 200 million for purchase of opium, 100 million for the Khuzestan wheat-growing project and a revolving fund of 100 million for his price-fixing scheme. Much of this expendi ture should come back, sooner or later, to the Government. All in all, however, he £ ^ estimates that the Government will find it necessary to borrow no less than^w 1,500 million rials in excess of taxation revenue. Owing to the rise in prices, expenditure has greatly increased, while revenue has fallen away owing to insecurity and disorder and a reduction of receipts from customs and State monopolies. A 'ppointments — Civil. 5. Murteza Quli Bayat (F.O. 50; M.A. 65), Vice-President of the Majlis, to be Minister of Finance. Persian Forces. 6 . Conditions in the army and gendarmerie are disquieting. There is grave discontent among officers, whose pay is entirely inadequate in relation to the prevailing cost of living, resulting in an increase in corruption and an almost mutinous insubordination. The men are generally little better off owing to the reduction in rations, due to the shortage of wheat and the high cost of food stuffs. Animals, in the majority, have been reduced almost to immobility by starvation owing to lack of fodder, and the mortality is high. Generally, there is a lack of confidence in the Government and of faith in the altruism of its intentions or the consistency of its policy. Mutual suspicion and jealousy among senior officers, lack of co-operation of the General Staff with the Ministry for War, opposition to the implementation of the proposals of the American advisers and political intrigues all make for vacillation, indiscipline and inaction. The army budget for the current year has not yet been sanctioned. Dr. Millspaugh has agreed to increase the allotment of 100 million rials, but the Ministry for War is holding out for a further increase. The cost of General Ridley’s reorganised army with the reforms in pay and conditions that he considers necessary was estimated to he 170 millon rials. Police. 7. The Bill for the establishment of a police training college has been approved by the Majlis. Internal Security. Pars. 8 . General Shahbakhti, after a period of indecision, has now reported to the Government that certain sections of the Qasbgai are bent on mischief and that security in Fars in general, and on the Bushire-Isfahan road in particular, cannot be maintained, nor can the harvest be collected, unless he takes offensive action against them. He has been given discretion to take such action as he considers necessary, giving the security of the road first priority. Qashgai bands have been pillaging; complaints against them and appeals for protection are now reaching the Government from landowners and villagers in Fars. Nasir Qashgai is reported to be preventing the transport of supplies from the countryside^to Shiraz, and his supporters in Tehran are now finding it difficult to rouse anv sympathy for him. Bakhtiari. 9. It is reported that operations are about to begin for the relief of the besieged Persian garrison in Qaleh Tul and that subsequently Persian forces are to be withdrawn to cover the oilfields. The Persian Government has not been able to send the reinforcements considered necessary for the re-establishment of the garrisons at Izeh and Qaleh Tul and to maintain a line of communication. The Bakhtiari are reported to be increasingly lawless in Chaharmahal, where Persian garrisons are small, and a report from Isfahan says that Abul Qasim Bakhtiari is preparing to cut the road by which reinforcements would be sent from Isfahan. These disturbances may be partly seasonal, but the temper of the tribes of the south is now such that the task of the Persian Government in3 • * establishing authority over them with the forces available is one of considerable difficulty, even if a consistent policy is followed. The forces available do not allow of more than one serious operation being undertaken at one time. Kermanshah. 10. Migrating tribes have been responsible for some robberies and for the 4 ^ hold-up of two U.K.C.C. lorries between Karind and Shahabad. The drivers ^were robbed and five bales of goods for Russia were carried off. A zerbaijan. 11. The Governor-General has informed His Majesty’s Consul-General that Persian troops from Ardebil have begun operations against certain tribesmen of the Talish district who have for some time been a nuisance to both the Russian and Persian authorities. Russian A ffairs. 12. The Russians have published in the local press a statement of their reasons for the breaking-off of relations with Sikorski’s Government. In the course of its argument the statement claims that the command of the Polish army is profoundly reactionary, chauvinistic, anti-democratic and pro-Fascist, Comment in the Persian press has on the whole been moderate. In order to avoid incidents the Poles have withdrawn from Kazvin a small military detachment that was stationed there in connexion with the evacuation of Poles to Khanakin. 13. The Soviet authorities, who have hitherto restricted their kidnappings to their own nationals and to Caucasian refugees, have recently kidnapped a Persian, an ex-official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by name Maghruri. 14. The Director of Iransovtrans in Tabriz recently informed the local representative of the U.K.C.C. that there had been trouble with the Cossacks in the Caucasus. Pending confimation, this report should be treated with reserve. A merican A ffairs. 15. The Americans have made some capital out of the presentation by General Connolly of a medal to an American soldier for having saved the life of a Persian at the risk of his own. 16. General Hurley has recently visited Tehran as personal representative of Mr. Roosevelt. Polish Affairs. 17. M. Stanczyk, Minister for Labour in the Polish Government in London, is now visiting Polish refugees in Persia. 18. The number of civilian Polish refugees still in Persia is In Tehran : 10,500 men, women and children. Isfahan : 1,983 men, women and children. Ahwaz : 4,322 men, women and children.

ALTHOUGH there are many prophecies of the early fall of the Govern ment, the Prime Minister has slightly strengthened his position. He appears to have shown some courage in pushing the Bill for the grant of powers to i)r. Millspaugh through the Majlis, hut. on I he other hand, in doing so he has saddled Dr. Millspaugh with the responsibility for the unpopular measures that , will have to be taken. Those interested in maintaining present conditions may still hope that Dr. Millspaugh’s measures will he sabotaged by unco-operative administrations. The Prime Minister still has the support of a number of the Deputies; he holds the portfolio of the Ministry of the Interior, and that Ministry can strongly influence the approaching elections. Economic. 2. The Bill granting powers to Dr. Millspaugh to control the collection, distribution and sale of commodities and raw materials, the wages of Government services and the rent of buildings has passed the Majlis. The text is given in an appendix to this Summary. 3. A Government commission sent to Isfahan to settle the disputes between the mill-owners and the workers has announced the following terms of settlement :— The mill-owners will provide— (a) Free bread for workers’ families. {h) Two suits of clothes for each workman per year. (c) Free drugs from the factory dispensary. The hours of work will not exceed eight per day. *4 pyointments — Civil. 4.—(i) Muhammad Ali Humayunjah (F.O. 87; M.A. 114) to be Under secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

A Deputy claiming to have influence with Nasir Qashgai has gone to Ears to endeavour to persuade him to submit and to tell him that popular opinion in Tehran has turned against him. There have been more articles in the Tehran press condemning Nasir’s intransigence and a broadcast was made recounting some of his t 41 - 61 ] 4 ^ oC ^ ^ ‘ 1 \ JUN1943 INDIA QFFldel2 * He is reported to be collecting grain in those areas of Fars where the harvest is already cut, from the sale of which on the black market he hopes to accumulate funds.

There was some opposition to the relieving column, but Persian casualties were light and the tribes dispersed. Trouble is, however, likely to break out again until the Persian Government is in a position to concentrate sufficient forces to compel the submission of Abul Qasim and to overawe the Bakhtiari tribes. Khuzestan. 7. Taking advantage of the preoccupation of the Persian forces on the eastern side of the province, Sheikh Chassib, the eldest son of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah, who has for some time been residing in Basra, provided himself with a bodyguard of 200 armed Arabs and announced that he intends to settle down on the ancestral lands belonging to his father. He may be able to get considerable Arab support and to incite the Arabs to combine against an attempt by the Persian authorities to continue the disarmament interrupted by the withdrawal of troops for the operations against the Bahmai and Bakhtiari. Russian A /fairs. 8 . The Russians have as yet gained little from the contract they made with the Persian munition factories for the manufacture of rifles and ammunition. They have hitherto failed to provide the raw materials and certain machinery which they had undertaken to supply. The machine-gun factory, which is to produce machine pistols, has not yet been put into operation although work is in progress. Of 13,5(H) rifles due by the 1 st May, only 5,000 have been delivered, and these had been made up from parts already in stock. Of 8 million rounds of ammunition due on the same date, only 700,000 had been delivered. The Russians have failed to supply any percussion caps. It is reported that they intend to introduce some ten to twelve of their own specialists into the factories. 9. Although reports from Persian sources are certainly exaggerated, there seems little doubt that the Russians are now taking an interest in the forthcoming elections, not only in their own zone. If the tone of the papers they support can be taken as due to Russian inspiration, they resent the maintenance of military governorship in Tehran and its ban on political meetings. They are credited, possibly unjustly, with encouraging the opposition to Dr. Millspaugh, and they certainly give no support to any of the American advisers, ihey ha\e asked foi payment in advance for the first instalment—15,000 tons—of the wheat they have promised to deliver to Persia. British Affairs. 10. His Majesty’s Minister has left Tehran to attend a conference in Cairo. Appendix. Millspaugh Powers Bill.

Tehran. XMh May, 1943. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 20 for the Period Wth to Ylth May, 1943. Persian Affairs. Political. THE Government successfully survived an interpellation in the Majlis asking for a vote of confidence, which was given to it by 94 Deputies of 110 present. This, however, is not a true indication of the Government’s stability or of the parliamentary support the Prime Minister enjoys. The interpellation challenged the legality of the appointment of two Deputies, I’Tebar (see Summary 1 No. 12/43, paragraphs 1 and 6 ) and Bayat (see Summary No. 18/43, p aragraph 5), iu*i» to ministerial posts, and also the right of the Government to transfer its authority under article 5*of the Military Governor Law to the Minister for War and put 3o0 tt its own interpretation on article 8 of the same law (see Summary No. 17 43 , paragraph 1). The position of the Prime Minister is weak; there are dissensions in the Cabinet, and it is, as usual, only the lack of an obvious successor that delays the Prime Minister’s fall. 2. The Tudeh party has issued confidentially to its branches its election manifesto and a list of forty candidates for election. Some of these are from the intelligentsia, but the majority are men of little standing. The Tudeh party is the only seriously organised political party in Persia. There can be no doubt that it is inspired and assisted from Russian sources. The fear that it may have a solid block of representatives in the next Parliament is very alive in political circles, and there is some talk of the necessity for organising Opposition parties, but it remains little more than talk. 3. Engineers in Government service have been on strike for some days for increases of pay and better conditions. They have recently been joined by professors of the university and some school-teachers. There is general unrest and dissatisfaction among educated Government employees, all of whom are underpaid. 4. The end of the African campaign has had on the whole a good press, but has not materially improved Anglo-Persian relations. For the present the progress of the war is of less interest to most Persians than their own internal affairs. Economic. 5. Dr. Millspaugh’s second monthly report to Parliament lays stress on the critical financial situation of the country, on the heavy indebtedness of the Govern ment to the National Bank, and on the necessity for ruthless reduction in expenditure. He states that the estimated revenue, together with the maximum amount that can be borrowed from the National Bank, which he puts at [42—33] . ** 4~J2 P 500 million rials, will not allow the Government to meet all its engagement^ He asserts that heavy borrowings by the Government in the past are as KUien responsible for inflation as expenditure by the Allies. He estimates Allied expenditure at 183 million rials per mensem. 6 . Bills have been laid before the Majlis for the engagement or further American experts, six for the Ministry of Food and three for the Ministry Finance, especially for the control of prices. Transport. 7. The United States Legation has issued a communique stating that up to date the American Government has delivered 342 lorries to the Persian Govern ment and thousands of tyres. The following statistics of the operations of the Road Transport Department are given :— Ton/kilometres. October November December January February March ... April ...

Appointments — Civil. 8 —(i) Bagher Kazemi (F.O. 105; M.A. 142), to be Persian Ambassador at Angora. (ii) Jalaluddin Keihan (F.O. 107; M.A. 144), to be Persian Consul-General in Constantinople.

(v) Saidi, to be Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Ways and Communications. (vi) Muhammad Ali Malikzadeh, to be Director-General in the Ministry of the Interior. (vii) Xasrullah Behnam, to be counsellor at the Persian Legation in Bagdad. Internal Security. Fars. 9. In last week’s summary it was mentioned that a Deputy had left for Fars to endeavour to persuade Nasir Qashgai to submit. He did not go. The Deputies of Fars, with the inevitable exception of Nowbakht, represented forcibly to the Prime Minister that no good could come of further negotiations with Nasir and that immediate steps should be taken to establish order in Fars and to put an end to Qashgai lawlessness and their interference with supplies.

The Persian forces have withdrawn from the Qaleh Tul area, but the rebellious tribesmen have not paid for their iniquities. As the Persian Govern ment have not sufficient troops to restrain by force all the tribes in active or latent revolt, they are trying to persuade Morteza Quli Khan, son of Samsam es Sultaneh, and the most influential and respected of the Bakhtiari Khans, to accept the postr 3 oi Governor of Bakhtiari territory. The latest reports are that he is inclined to accept. Although he has been separated from the tribe for some years, his influence should be sufficient to control the Bakhtiari and to eject Abul Qasim. He himself is not the man to encourage tribal movements against the Government. A zerbaijan. 12.

THE obvious weakness and indecision of the Prime Minister, who also holds the portfolio of the Ministry of the Interior, are arousing grave fears whether he will be able materially to influence the elections and prevent the return of a number of Tudeh candidates to the Majlis. There is some agitation for the appointment of a Minister of the Interior with more firmness. There is growing discontent among the Deputies with Soheily s inconsistencies and falsehoods.. Ali Mansur (F.O. 120; M.A. 164) seems to be a likely successor. 2. Sipahbod Ahmadi, the Minister for War, has refused to act any longer as Military Governor of Tehran. His strict and vigorous application of the military law brought him into constant conflict with those of his colleagues in the Cabinet who are anxious to curry favour with press and Deputies and all parties. 3. The strike of the engineers and professors continues. The half-hearted attempts of the Government to settle it have resulted only in the strikers making increased demands. The unrest is spreading among other educated and underpaid servants of the Government. Anxiety has been caused by Dr. Millspaugh's statements in his second monthly report to the Government to the effect that the number of employees in Government departments must be reduced, and that increases of pay. necessary though he admitted them to be. could not be expected until the financial situation had improved. \ T ransport. 4. The Prime Minister has issued orders that, since great difficulty is being experienced in providing tyres for cars required for essential Government service, all Government cars are to be withdrawn from the private charge of individuals and to be pooled for use as required.

THE Prime Minister continues to sit uneasily. A remark by the Shah to the effect that he held no brief for Soheily, but that the next incumbent might be worse, and that, in any case, to change Prime Ministers during a critical period was unsound, probably reflects the opinion of many Persians and accounts for Soheily’s retention of his office. 2. Delegates representing the engineers and professors on strike recently interviewed Dr. Millspaugh, but were disappointed on being told by him that the state of the nation’s finances did not allow of an increase in pay at present. The strike continues and it may now extend to other Government employees. 3. Some of the Tehran newspapers published a report that General Shahbakhti had resigned from the army and that General Ahmedi had taken over from him in Ears. They added, as a precautionary measure, that this report had not been confirmed to date. It is obvious that this “ report ” was inspired by Ahmedi’s ill-wishers, of whom, owing to his fearlessness, there are many, and by Nasir Qashgai’s adherents in the capital. The obvious implication of the report is that General Shahbakhti was too high-souled a patriot to become the instrument of British hostility against the Qashgai, a role more suited to the Minister for War. Economic. 4. The Third Regulation for the Stabilisation of Prices is published as an appendix to this summary. The first two regulations refer to powers and duties and are not of sufficient importance to be reproduced here. 5 . The text of Dr. Millspaugh’s temporary rent restriction regulations is given as Appendix 1 to this summary. 6 . Owing to the heavy loss to Government resulting from the sale of bread to the public at the present price while wheat is purchased by Government at 3,000 rials per ton, it has been decided to increase the price of bread by 1 rial per kilogramme. This increase has been sharply criticised in the press on the ^rounds that it was unjustified in view of the bumper harvest reported from all districts, that it hits hardest the poor, who nowadays eat little but bread, and that the enhancement in price of a staple diet must inevitably lead to a general increase in all other living expenses.

The news of the appointment of Morteza Quli Khan as Governor of Bakhtiari has been generally welcomed by the tribe and has already had a steadying effect in some cases, and to some extent undermined the position of Abul Qasim Bakhtiari. He has already been deserted by some of his followe^i*^ and he has sent a message to the Persian Commander at Isfahan to the effect th* j he wishes to discuss terms of submission. The Janeki tribesmen under Majid Bakhtiari, son of Sardar Muazzam, who attacked the Persian garrisons at Izeh and Qaleh-i-Tul (see Summary No. 17/43, paragraph 11) are still being trouble some. and attacked a small Persian garrison at Qaleh-i-Gandurman, about 40 miles west of Shah Reza (Qumisheh). Reinforcements were sent from Urujan, some 10 miles to the north-east, and the tribesmen were drawn off. Fars. 10. General Shahbakhti’s operations for the occupation of Nasir Qashgai’s stronghold at Firuzabad make slow T progress. The column from Kazarun has reached Jirreh, 30 miles to the east, and the column from Jahrum has reached the vicinity of Qir-o-Qavzin, 25 miles to the west. The column from Kavar met with considerable resistance and is being reinforced, having apparently been checked. Meanwhile, air operations are being carried out against any tribal concentrations presenting targets. No attempt has yet been made by the tribesmen to interfere with traffic on the road. Qavam-ul-Mulk, whose family has for generations played an influential part in Fars politics, has been sent to Shiraz by the Shah at the request of General Shahbakhti. It is hoped that his influence will restrict the number of Nasir’s supporters and give confidence to those tribes who are distrustful of the Government. There is general satisfaction in Fars . that the Government has at last taken action indicating an intention to restrict Qashgai depredations. 11 . There is little accurate information regarding the whereabouts of the sub-tribes. The greater part of the Darashuri are believed to have reached their summer quarters; the Kashquli are reported to be endeavouring to get passage through the Dushmanziari country, but to have been opposed by the latter tribe. The Farsimadan and Shishbuluki were ordered by Nasir Qashgai to return to their winter quarters, but some sections may have disobeyed the order and gone north. The small sub-tribes are for the most part still in winter quarters. British Affairs. 12. General Sir H. Pownall, Commander-In-Chief, Paiforce, visited Tehran from the 21st to 24th May. 13. His Majesty’s Minister, accompanied by the Oriental Secretary, left for Isfahan on the 20th May and, accompanied by the military attache, left Isfahan for Shiraz on the 25th May. They returned on the 31st May. 14. The Government of India have provided a mobile company of Indian infantry to assist in the campaign against locusts in the Kerman-Bam-Zahidan area.

Appendix 1 . Rent Restriction Law. THE laws No. 7, regarding fixed prices, were established yesterday by the Director-General of Finance in agreement with the Ministry of Justice as follows :— In view of the powers obtained in accordance with the law passed on the 4th May, 1943, it is laid down, in agreement with the Ministry of Justice, that— ( 1 ) The rent of houses or part of a house, as well as of all other immovable property leased as at the 20th February, 1943, must not exceed the amount of the rent at that date. If the property is not yet let, it must not exceed the amount of the rent of properties of the same category on the same date. (2) Persons living in houses on the date of coming into force of the preceding article, if they are not already liable to expulsion, will remain in their domicile at the rent paid previous to the preparation of definite regulations. (3) If the rent of houses and property has been increased after the date of the 20 th February, 1943. their rent after the 23rd May, 1943, will be the same as that on the 20th February, 1943. (4) These laws are provisional and will remain in force as long as the regulations and alteration of rents have not been established. A. S. MILLSPAUGH, Director-General of Finance. Appendix 2.

Tehran, %th June, 1943. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military A ttache’s Intelligence Summary No. 23 for the Period ls£ to 1th June 1943. Political. Persian Affairs. HIS Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by Queen Fowzieh, the Minister of the Court and members of his personal staff, left Tehran for a visit to Isfahan on the 6 th June. The Shah may go on to Shiraz, but this visit will depend on the # stage reached in General Shahbakhti’s operations against Nasir Qashgai. The effect of the Shah’s visit to the provinces, whose inhabitants feel that they get very little consideration from the Central Government, should be good. The Shah usually succeeds in making a good impression in his personal •contacts. 2 . Political circles in Tehran, and in the provinces, are greatly concerned about the next elections. The term of the present Majlis ends on the 23rd November, elections should take place on the 24th September, and three months before that, on the 23rd June, the official announcement that new elections will take place is due to be made. Various coalitions of Majlis parties are being formed, new parties are being organised outside the Majlis for the purpose of pushing new candidates, but so far the only party that has appeared with organisation and discipline is the Tudeh party. ' The Prime Minister has promised that the elections will be free, that military governorship will be abolished for the period of the election campaign and political meetings freely allowed. But thesis little faith left, even among his wavering supporters in the i Majlis, in the Prime Minister’s promises or in his capacity to ensure the re-election of any Deputy even if he wdshed to do so. There are few Persians who do not believe that the Tudeh party is supported, inspired and kept together by Russian influence, or that it will eventually be used as an instrument of Soviet policy. 3. Discontent with the Prime Minister increases on all sides, and his early fall is predicted. Seyyid Zia ed Din Tabatabai has a growing number of supporters in spite of the fact that it is generally believed that the Shah would oppose his appointment as Prime Minister. Even Qavam es Sultaneh, who has returned to Tehran, is being mentioned as a possible successor, but he has many bitter opponents. 4. Representatives of the professors and engineers on strike were inter viewed by the Shah on the 5th June, and the strikers resumed work on the following day. The terms of the settlement are not known. 5. After his interview with the strikers which was mentioned in Summary -ifebl .No- 22/43, paragraph 2 , Dr. Millspaugh published in the press a statement of 1 his views, which provoked much unfavourable criticism. After statino- categorically that until Government could afford to increase the salaries of all deserving employees he would not agree to giving increases to any one class, least of all to strikers, he went on to accuse the strikers of attempting to intimidate [42—60] /7/n sy.jr_ *&gt;the Government and of acting under the influence of political agitators. This called forth a rejoinder which reminded Dr. Millspaugh that he had authority to speak on financial questions only, that the political aspect was not his concern, and that the salaries of two of the many foreign advisers now being paid by the Government would go far towards improving conditions for the engineers and professors. 6 . The following newspapers which had been suppressed have now been allowed to reappear : Mehr i Iran, Bakhtar, Iqdam, Keikan, Kurshid i Iran. Economic. 7. The terms of the Soviet-Persian Financial Agreement have now been published. The following are the principal points :— {a) Persia is obliged to supply the Soviet authorities with all rials they need (over and above the rials realised by the Soviet authorities through the sale of goods) up to a limit of the equivalent of 15-5 million dollars in any period of six months (at present rate of exchange = 500 million rials). (5) Rials will be obtained by the Soviet authorities on demand against the equivalent in United States dollars, credited to the Persian Govern ment in blocked account in Moscow. (c) At the end of each calendar half-year the balance of the blocked dollars account in Moscow will be converted as to 60 per cent, into gold. Silver may be substituted for gold by mutual agreement. {d) The official dollar/rial rate of exchange will be observed; the price of gold and silver will be calculated at official prices ruling in the United States. 8 . The text of a reciprocal trade agreement between the United States and Persia, which was signed at Washington on the 8 th April, has been published in the press. 9. Dr. Millspaugh has issued a regulation—No. 5—declaring that the import and sale of the following commodities will in future be a Government monopoly : All cotton goods, sacking and wrapping material, soap and candles, electric light bulbs, insulated wire, paints of all sorts, chemical products of all sorts, motor vehicles, spare parts and accessories, tyres and tubes, lamps, lamp chimneys and wicks, china-ware, glass-ware and kitchen utensils, pins and needles, paper, typewriters and their accessories, ink, coal, firewood, charcoal, all threads. Stocks of these commodities at present in the country or on order from abroad must be declared to the Government. 10. Dr. Millspaugh has presented to the Majlis a Bill for the revision of the Income-Tax Law. His proposals include : Exemption of incomes of 6,000 rials per annum and, in addition, of certain specified amounts for depen dants; exemption of interest on savings and of an amount equivalent to nine times the amount of interest received from savings or deposit accounts or Govern ment bonds; exemption of the salaries of Government employees and peasants; a tax on taxable incomes, after deducting the amount exempted^pf 2 per cent, on incomes up to 10,000 rials per annum, increasing to 80 per cent, on incomes exceeding 500,000 rials per annum. The effect would be to lighten the burden of taxation on small incomes while heavily increasing that on large incomes. The maximum tax now imposed is 20 per cent. 11. The Bill, as was to be expected, has aroused the violent opposition of the rich, who have launched a campaign in the press and among venal Deputies to oppose it. It is criticised on the grounds that it will stifle enterprise and production, and that the Government has not the machinery to enforce it. It has been welcomed by the lower classes. 12 . Dr. Millspaugh has instructed all Ministries that, since revenue is insufficient to meet expenditure, a reduction of 15 per cent, to 25 per cent, must be made in the number of Government employees. Until this reduction has been put into effect no salaries will be paid. 13. The Bill referred to in Summary No. 13/43, p aragraph 3, for the issue of tax-free Treasury bonds to the value of 500 million rials and for an increase in the amount of coinage of low denomination from 54J million rials to 75 million rials is now being debated in the Majlis. The increase of small coinage has been approved. 14. The Anglo-1 rani an Oil Company has agreed that royalties to be paid to the Persian Government should be fixed at £4 million per annum until the end of the war.3 15. A municipal tax of 40 dinars per litre has been imposed on petrol in Tehran. 16. The increase in the price of bread (see Summary No. 22/43, para graph 6 ) has aroused universal discontent among the poor. Local officials, fearing riots, have in some places refused to apply it. In Ardebil there were riots in protest, which the Russians are accused of having encouraged. 17. The Prime Minister has instructed the Ministry of Commerce and ^Industry that the following reforms are to be put into effect in factories :— (a) Hours of work are to be reduced, especially for women and children. (b) Children under 12 years of age not to be employed. (c) Effective measures are to be taken to ensure the health of workers. {d) The Workers’ Insurance Bill, when it becomes law, is to be strictly enforced. (e) Washing and recreation facilities are to be provided for the workers. 18. A postal airgraph service between Persia and Great Britain was inaugurated on the 2nd June. 19.

Internal Security. 23 Very little progress has been made with the operations for the occuoation of Firuzabad. Persian troops have occupied Farashband, but the main advance from Kavar is still held up, and it is now confirmed that this column met with a reverse. Reinforcements of a battalion from Isfahan and another from Tehran have been sent to General Shahbakhti. Casualties suneied bv the Persian forces have been reported by General Shahbakhti to the Shah as 2 ^ killed and 105 wounded, mostly slightly. He also claims to have inflicted very heavy casualties on the Qashgai. He reports that there is evidence that .up operations of the tribes are being directed by Germans, who have also organised a hospital in Firuzabad for the wounded. Heavy destruction has been carried out on the Kavar-Firuzabad road. There have been minor robberies of drivers on the road and the first serious interference with Russian convoys, when two Russian trucks, driven by Persian drivers, were held up forced off the road and bu nt It is reported that, in addition to the Darashun the Kashquh and Farsimadan tribes are moving to their summer quarters, pillaging villages in accordance with tribal custom on the way. 1 he Shishbuluki and smaller tribes are apparently still in winter quarters and they must be in some discomfort. The Mamassani and Dushmanziari tribes show no inclination to support Aasir Qashgai and may even be persuaded to give active support to the Government.4 24. There is considerable dissatisfaction, among all except Nasir’s adherents, with the lack of determination being shown by General Shahbakhti in his operations; the Shah has expressed his displeasure and has instructed the Minister for War to telegraph to General Shahbakhti to the effect that the Shah expects to have news of the capture of Firuzabad while he is at Isfahan (see paragraph 1 above). This, however, is not likely to have much effect. Agitation by the Deputy Nowbakht and his pro-Axis associates continues in Tehran. An anonymous pamphlet was circulated which pertinently asked wl/^ of the many robbers in Persia only the Qashgai should be pursued; why not the Prime Minister, who had previously been driven out of office because of his robberies; who protected the Kurds so that they were allowed to keep their arms; and did not General Shahbakhti realise that he would get no better reward than other tools of the English such as the ex-Shah and Admiral Darlan ? K uh-i-Galu. 25. It does not appear that the Boir Ahmadi intend to give any active support to Nasir Qashgai, but they may be relied upon to take advantage of any disorder that may occur. Their chiefs are reported to be fully occupied with the inter-clan feuds, which are characteristic of the Boir Ahmadi. K huzestan. 26. It is surprising that, in spite of the preoccupations of the Persian troops on the eastern side of the province and of the excitement among the Arabs caused by the incursion of Sheikh Chassib (see Summary No. 19/43, paragraph 7) and by the deportation by the Persian authorities of a respected Arab religious leader, Sayyid Issa Kamaliddin, on the grounds that he was an exciting influence among the Arabs, the Beni Turuf have continued to surrender their arms and by the end of the month had handed in over 500. K ermanshah. 27. His Majesty’s Consul reports that there is growing restlessness among the tribes of the Kermanshah Province. There has been inter-clan fighting over a land dispute at Paveh, the Jawanrudi tribesmen driving out the sons of Jaafar Sultan. For the time being peace has been restored. British Affairs. 28. His Majesty’s Legation has informed the Persian Government that, since it was not previously consulted, it does not consider that His Majesty’s Government is bound by the provisions of the Director-General’s Regulation No. 3, which stipulates that the requirements in local purchases of foreign Powers shall be determined in advance every six months in agreement with the Administrator-General for the Stabilisation of Prices—see Summary No. 22/43, paragraph 4 and Appendix 2 . His Majesty’s Legation is, however, prepared to discuss methods of regulating local purchase. Chinese Affairs. 29.

Military Attache's Intelligence Summary. No. 24, for the 'period %th to IMh June, 1943. m Political. Persian Affairs. 1. The Shah and his party returned to Tehran on the 12 th June. During his stay in Isfahan he visited troops, hospitals, mills, schools and neighbouring villages. His Majesty’s Consul at Isfahan considers that the visit was a success. 2. In political circles the main topics of interest are the next elections and the Income Tax Bill. It is to be feared that the opponents of the latter are organising their forces more effectively than its supporters. The Bill is to be examined by three Mailis Commissions, who will estimate its effects on agriculture, commerce and the Budget. 3. In addition to those mentioned in Summary No. 23/43, paragraph 6 , the following newspapers have now been allowed to re-appear : Nabard i Imruz, Mihan Parastan, Azadegan. Economic. 4. The bread, situation is now fairly satisfactory throughout the country. In Tehran there were on the 6 th June over 7,500 tons of grain in reserve in Government stores, of which, according to the Tehran press, 4.234 tons had been received from Russia against the promised quantity of 25,000 tons. British and American deliveries now total 17,500 tons of the'25,000 promised under the Food Agreement. Reports from the provinces show that the bread supply of the j principal towns is likely to be assured until the harvest. The prospect of a bumper harvest is inducing hoarders to market their grain now, and generally plentiful supplies of good bread are available for those who can pay the free prices. | The next crop should produce a considerable surplus of grain over Persia’s | requirements for the year, provided hoarding and smuggling can be prevented. The Income Tax Bill has had the effect of making landlords more reluctant to declare their surpluses, fearing that they may he taken as a basis for assessment of income tax. In Khuzestan, where the crop is already harvested, a Government Commission has been fairly successful in obtaining undertakings from the land lords. In Bars the landlords, anxious to avoid the interference of Government officials in the assessment and collection of their crops, have contracted to deliver to Government 36,000 tons of wheat at the Government price, irrespective of their surpluses. Similar arrangements may be made in Isfahan. Prices of foodstuffs show a tendency to fall. 5. A Bill has been presented to the Majlis asking for sanction for a credit of 160 million rials for the Persian Government munition factories. These factories are manufacturing arms and ammunition for the Russians, and the credit is required for the purchase of raw materials, to meet the cost of the completion of the Machine Gun Factory to enable it to manufacture machine pistols, and for the running expenses of the factories. In the contract made with the Russians the latter made no definite undertaking regarding the method, time or rate of payment for arms taken over and they have as yet made no payments. 6 . The Persian press states that the amount of revenue received from indirect taxation during the year March 1942-February 1943 was 362.397,395 rials and that this was an increase of 104,033.395 rials over the receipts of the [43-18] 09 a. Fats previous year. The principal sources of revenue from indirect taxation are the 3 per cent, tax levied on all commodities brought to markets for sale and the tax on oils and petrol. These account for over 250 million rials. 7. In addition to the places mentioned in Summary No. 23/43, paragraph 19, locust swarms have been reported at Zabul, Birjand, Turbat i Haidari, Quchan, Bujnurd, Kashan and in the vicinity of Tehran. The Government has issued a decree ordering the Ministries of the Interior and for War to instruct all their officials in the provinces to undertake a vigorous campaign against locusts wherever found and to call on village headmen, tribal chiefs and peasants to give all necessary assistance. A appointments — Civil. 8 . Muhsin Qarib, to be Director General in the Ministry of Food. Persian Army. 9. A beginning has been made in Tehran with the organisation of a Central Recruit Training Depot and of a Central Depot of Administrative Services as proposed by General Ridley, see Summary No. 2/43, paragraph 9 . All recruits on conscription now go to the Central Training Depot, where they will be trained for six months before being drafted to their units. The organisation of the Central Depot for Administration is meeting with much obstruction and it is not yet in effective operation. Three more American officers have now joined General Ridley's staff, which now consists of three field and three junior officers. A ppointments — Military. 10 . Sarhang Shahandeh, to be Commander of the Behbehan Brigade. Pars. Internal Security. 11 . Ihe Persian forces occupied Firuzabad on the 11 th June, having met with little serious opposition since their severe fight on the 25th May. On the 10th June an attack was made on the column that advanced from Lar to Khunj, which, according to the Persian General Staff, was beaten off with loss to the tribesmen. ISasir and those of his followers who have not dispersed have now r taken refuge in the hills lying between Firuzabad and Farrashband. The Persian forces at the latter place have reported that they have found a w 7 ell-prepared landing ground, which is now being used by the Persian Air Force. 12. Ihe Persian General Staff has announced that the occupation of Firuzabad, Farrashband, Qir o Qavzin, Khunj and Ahram—the important places in the area previously controlled by Nasir Qashgai—completes the first phase of the operations; the second phase is to pursue and disarm the rebels. It is probable that organised resistance by Nasir Qashgai is now at an end. It is certain that he called on the maximum support he could get for the defence of the centres where he had exercised an unchallenged rule for over eighteen months, where his stores of grain and any munitions he had were collected, and where he had prepared landing grounds for the arrival of German aircraft. The loss of these places will be not only damaging to his prestige among the tribes, but also a great blow to the Germans and the pro-German party in Persia, who were still working to keep alive the belief that German forces might still reach Persia and reward those who had prepared for their arrival. Nasir is now a fugitive but he may still be in a position to send out raiding bands to be a nuisance. General Shahbakhti is now offering safe-conduct to those tribal families who have remained in winter quarters to persuade them to move to their summer quarters. 13. It has been reported in previous Summaries that the Mamassanni Khans had refused all Nasir’s invitations to support him in resistance to the Government. These Khans have been asking that their possession of certain lands should oe legally confirmed and they had been promised that a Commission would be sent to Pars to investigate their claims. It is unfortunate that Dr. Millspaugh in his capacity of Director-General of Finance should have chosen this moment when the situation in Fars is still delicate, to send them telegrams informing them that their claims could not be considered as they had no legal basis. Western A zerbaijan. 14. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul in Azerbaijan recently visited Rezaieh. He reports that the Kurdish situation is quiet and attributes this to the warning given to the Kurds by the Soviet Consul at Rezaieh that disorder mie-ht comnpl th* intervention of Soviet troops.

Tehran, ^nd June, 1943. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military Attache’s Intelligence Summary No. 25 for the 'period loth to 'list June, 1943. Persian A ffairs. Political. 1 . The Deputies of the Majlis, whose main interest at present is to secure a prolongation of the present Parliament, have recently been heavily attacked in the press. At their request the Prime Minister drafted a Bill to limit the number of newspapers in Tehran and the provinces and to establish a press censorship. The Bill is said to have been approved in secret session, but when the Prime Minister presented it in open Parliament wuth the request that it should be treated with double urgency the Majlis refused this request, whereupon the Prime Minister withdrew the Bill. It is alleged in some quarters that the object of the Deputies was to discredit the Prime Minister, but the outcome is that, after some complicated lobbying, a majority of the Deputies has promised to continue to support the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has promised to do his best to ensure the re-election of the Deputies. 2 . In spite of this the Cabinet is shaky and weakened by internal strife. The many candidates for the premiership are very busy endeavouring to secure support. An active campaign against Seyyid Zia-ed-Din has been launched in some newspapers, one going so far as to claim that it knew that the Soviet Ambas sador was opposed to the return of Seyyid Zia, because of his known hostility to Soviet interests, and stating that, since the whole of Northern Iran was in Soviet hands, the northern neighbours could cause thousands of difficulties if they were displeased. 3. The Minister of Justice. Ali As^har Hikmat, has resigned from the Cabinet as he disagreed with the Press Bill referred to in paragraph 1 above. Rahnema, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister, has also resigned, to the general relief. He was an evil and mischief-making man. 4. Another resignation was that of Misbazadeh, the Director of the Depart ment of Press and Propaganda. This was followed by an announcement that the department would be dissolved and reorganised on a different basis. 5 . The Majlis is successfully employing delaying tactics in dealing with the Income Tax Bill and other measures proposed by Dr. Millspaugh, notably the Bills for the engagement of additional American advisers. Economic. 6 . Dr. Millspaugh, in his third monthly report, states that the greater part of the difficulties with which the Government are faced are due to the war and to the utilisation by the Allies of Persian territory, of Government establishments and of means of transport. The Allies had given much help to Persia, but more was needed if a financial and economic collapse was to be avoided. The Allies could help— (i) By reducing their rial expenditure, (ii) By increasing imports. [43—34] oX 4 6y.o(iii) By collaborating closely with the Persian Government in prevention of the export of essential good^ (iv) By paying customs dues on aljr the goods they import that are not explicitly exempted. (v) By refraining from pressing the Persian Government to spend money on repairs of buildings, &amp;c., occupied by Allied troops. 4 (yi) By abstaining from paying high wages to Persian labourers. (vii) By revising contracts which compel the Persian Government to borrow' money to pay for machinery and raw materials required for the manufacture of munitions. (viii) By agreeing that payment by the Persian Government for goods pii] 1 - chased in Allied countries should be postponed until after the war. Points (v) and (vii) are directed against the Russians, who recently asked that the Persian Government should repair, at a cost of 30 million rials, Persian barracks occupied by Soviet troops in Azerbaijan. Point (vii) refers to the con tract made with the Persian Government for the manufacture of arms. 7. The Soviet indebtedness to Persia is estimated by the Director-General of Finance to amount to approximately 180 million tomans, of which 46 millions are due to the Ministry of Food, 80 millions to the Railway Administration and 50 millions to the Customs. It would be interesting to know how the Soviet spend the 83 million rials which they obtain monthly by their Financial Agreement with the Persian Government. 8 . The press announces the arrival in Tehran by air from the United States of gold purchased by the Persian Government with their dollar credits which is to be sold with a view to bringing rials back to the Treasury. The amount is said to be the equivalent of 500,000 dollars at the New York price of gold. Some of the silver purchased by the Persian Government in India (see Summary No. 42/42, paragraph 3) is also being put on the market. 9. The Ministry of Roads and Communications have been granted credits to complete the Zinjan-Mianeh section of the railway line, and refused credits for the completion of the line Shahrud-Sabzevar-Nishapur. 10 . Extracts from the Director-General of Finance’s Regulation No. 8 for the control of the sale and use of motor vehicles and accessories are attached as an appendix. Persian Forces. 11 . The Minister for War states that General Ridley had written to him to the effect that, in view of the lack of co-operation of the Persian military autho rities he would be obliged to inform his Government that it was useless for him and his mission to remain longer in Persia. General Ridley’s principal complaint was that the General Staff would not let him have suitable officers to staff his training and administrative depots (see Summary No. 24/43, paragraph 9). General Ridley has said that he has now been promised the officers he wants; that he is satisfied with the support he receives from the Minister for War, but meets with much obstruction from the General Staff. There is no doubt that the Chief of the General Staff, although he has grudgingly accepted a limited role for the American advisers, does little to help them even within these limits. This question has further widened the breach between the Ministry for War and the General Staff. Discord became so serious that the Chief of the General Staff asked the Shah to accept his resignation as he could not work with the Minister for War. The Shah instructed him to take two months’ leave. Internal Security. Fars. 12. The statement in Summary No. 24/43, paragraph 13, to the effect that Dr. Millspaugh had informed the Mamassanni Khans that their claims to land could not be considered is incorrect. Dr. Millspaugh had given no such decision. 13. The situation in Fars, so far as it is known, remains much as it was described in last week’s Summary. General Shahbakhti has made no movement of importance, but he has stated that he intends to continue with the disarmament of the Qashgai tribes. It is likely that he will come to some arrangement with the tribes regarding the surrender of a certain proportion of their arms. Nasir Qashgai is still in hiding, and is reported to have his brother with him. No serious interference with the Bushire-Shiraz road has been reported.c 3 Khorassan. 14- Fighting is reported between rival sections of the Zafaranlu Kurds of Kuchan. Turkish Affairs. 15. The Minister for War reports that he has information that a secret society has been formed in Azerbaijan to encourage a, movement for secession to I urkey, the argument being that, since Persia is unable to save Azerbaijan from bolshevism, Turkish protection must be sought. Apart from the fact that the Persian Government maintains an expensive intelligence organisation which has to justify its existence, the Minister for War is not above inventing bogies. 16. The Turkish Government has offered 500,000 doses of small-pox vaccine to Persia. American Affairs. 17. An American, Mr. Harold Allen, an expert in agriculture and rural development, has arrived for service with the Persian Government. Russian Affairs. 18. The Soviet Consulate in Ahwaz has opened a shop in the town for the display and sale of their propaganda material. Tehran, 21s£ June, 1943. Appendix. Extracts from Director-General of Finance's Regulation No. 8 . dated ‘lOth June, 1943. Article 1. UNTIL such time as the regulations relating to the fixing of prices and rationing are issued and Government retail shops are opened, no merchant or other person, who has in his possession, for sale or in excess of his personal require ments, car or lorry spare parts, tools or tyres (whether inner tubes or outer covers), may sell them except in the two following ways : — (a) To actual users or consumers; that is to say, to persons who will at once bring the article in question into use on his car or lorry.

After 5 p.m. on the 5 th July, 1943, any car which is seen without a car licence fixed on the windscreen where it can be clearly seen will be confiscated by the Price Stabilisation Section. Article 8 . Henceforth no car may be transferred to a new owner, either by sale or by any other means, without the permission of the Price Stabilisation Section. In the event of infringement of this article the Price Stabilisation Section will confiscate the offender’s car. Article 10. This regulation does not apply to the cars of the Imperial Iranian Army, nor to the cars of the foreign military authorities which are at present in Iran; there fore, army cars distinguished as such will not need a permit.

Tehran, 2$th June, 1943. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache’s Intelligence Summary No. 26, for the 'period the 22nd to the 2%th June, 1943. Persian Affairs. Political. A ROIAL Decree has been issued ordering preparations for new elections to begin on the 23rd June. In Tehran and to a lesser degree in the provinces canvassing has already begun. Ihe Tudeh party, still generally the most active party, has agreed with two other Left parties, the Hamrahan and the Millat, that they will not oppose each other’s candidates. A Democratic party, the Adalat, which has been in existence for some time in name, has recently been adding appreciably to its numbers. The Shah is reported on fairly reliable authority to be creating an organisation to ensure the return for Tehran of candidates of his choice, and it is alleged that the Chief of the General Staff is spending the leave given to him from his military duties (see Summarv No. 25/43, paragraph 11 ) in furthering the Shah’s election plans. 2 . The Majlis has ratified the Anglo-Persian Financial Agreement (see Summary No. 12/43, paragraph 2), which it has had under consideration since March of this year. Little progress has yet been made with other Bills that have already been before Parliament for some time, the more important of which are the Income Tax Bill, the Bills for Compulsory Education, Insurance of Workers, the Issue of Treasury Bonds, and for the engagement of additional American advisers. 3. The priesthood is again beginning to acquire importance after a long period of eclipse. Some of them are being courted by the Shah and politicians. Arrangements are being made to give an impressive reception to Haji Aga Hussein Mujtahid Qumi, a prominent Shia divine of Kerbela, who is shortly revisiting Persia. While the priesthood has little influence with the so-called educated classes, it is still regarded with some respect by the lower classes, and the advances now being made to certain influential mullahs probably have their origin in the hope that their influence may be used against the spread of Communistic ideas. 4. A new paper has appeared—-the Guity —which purports to be the organ of the Iranian Workers’ Union, a union which has representatives in the provinces but about which little is known. It is unlikely that the paper will survive without Soviet support. 5. The Government finds itself critically short of cash. It has with difficulty met its obligations for the past (Persian) month, which ended on the 22nd June, but sees no prospect of meeting its obligations for the current month without foreign help. 500 million rials are required immediately to finance purchases of wheat under the scheme devised by the Adviser to the 'Ministry of Food. The Majlis has been asked to sanction the borrowing of this amount from the National Bank, but the bank has in fact not more than 70 million rials to lend. If a complete breakdown of the Administration is to be avoided it seems that a loan will have to be provided from British and/or American sources. [43—44] 1 ^ /y2 Economic. 6 . In the preamble to the Bill asking the Majlis to sanction a loan of 500 million rials by the National Bank to the Ministry of Food, the Government explains that of the 750 million rials previously borrowed 579,180,000 rials represented the loss to Government in selling bread at a price lower than its cost. 7. In March last the Majlis sanctioned the exchange of gold coins, held by the Treasury as backing for the note issue, against gold ingots to be imported | g^ by the British authorities. These ingots have now arrived and have been exchanged for gold coins which are now being sold to the public on British account by the National and Imperial Banks. The rials so obtained will be available for British expenditure in Persia without increasing the note issue. The price of gold has dropped. 8 . By his Regulation No. 9 the Director-General of Finance (Dr, Millspaugh) has decreed that raw cotton shall be a Government monopoly, and that the price, sale, distribution and export shall be controlled by the Price Stabilisation Section of the Ministry of Finance. 9. By his Regulation No. 10 the Director-General of Finance has decreed that the Price Stabilisation Section shall prepare every six months, or at such other time as it may consider necessary, a list of Persia’s requirements of imported goods, classified in the following categories :— (i) Civilian (non-military) requirements. (ii) Requirements of Government administrations. (iii) Industrial requirements. 10. There are now over 10,000 tons of grain in reserve in Tehran. Russian deliveries against their promised 25,000 tons now amount to over 9,000 tons. The press announces that up to the 20th June undertakings or contracts to deliver wheat had been obtained from landlords as follows :— Tons. In Isfahan province ... ... ... ... 59,000 In Pars province ... ... ... ... 39,000 In Khuzestan province ... ... ... 16,000 These figures are considerably in excess of last year’s undertakings. A appointments — Civil. II- (i) Muhsin Rais (F.O. 172; M.A. 239), to be Persian Minister in Bagdad. He had previously been appointed to be Consul-General in Delhi but had not left Tehran. (ii) Dr. Ghulam Ali R’adi Azarkashi, to be Director-General of the Ministry of Education. (iii) Hishmat Sanii,^ to be Governor of Ahwaz and Deputy Governor- General of Khuzestan. (iv) Kazim Sayyah, to be Director-General of the newly-created Depart ment of Distribution in the Ministry of Finance. (v) Muhammad Hejazi, to be Director of the Department of Press and Propaganda. Persian Forces. Police. 12 . The pay of the Police has been increased. A 3rd-grade constable now draws 600 rials per month. Even at this rate recruits will be difficult to obtain. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 13. The Persian General Staff has reports from the commander of the Persian troops in Senneh of the return to Persia from Iraq of Mahmud Dizli. This chief had been a continual source of trouble for some twelve years or so until, driven out of Persia in 1931 by Persian forces, he surrendered to the Iraqi authorities and has since been detained in Iraq. The reports say that on arrival in his village of Dizli he summoned the chiefs of Merivan and Avroman and others, and later sent a letter, signed by himself and other chiefs to the Persian commander calling upon him to withdraw all Persian forces from Kurdistan and threatening to raise the Kurdish tribes to drive them out if the demand were not promptly complied with. It is doubtful whether this threat is more than bluff and whether Mahmud Dizh will get much support as the Kurds of this area have been left in relative peace by the Persian authorities for some time past3 Furs. ^ ur ^her operations have taken place. General Shahbakhti is moving some or his troops reported to be nearly 2 , 000 —from the Firuzabad area towards j: adeh and the Qashgai summer quarters, where the greater part of the tribes n f'xr 1S ’ \ ^ e . ^ ec ^ arec ^ intention of collecting their arms. The whereabouts ot ^asir Qashgar is not known, nor is there any information to show that General ^^gnahltakhti is taking any steps to hunt him down. There has been no interference luring the week with British or Russian traffic on the road. Bakhtiari. 15. Morteza Quli Khan (see Summary No. 22 / 43 , paragraph 9 ) has left iehran to take up his appointment as Governor of Bakhtiari. British Affairs. 16. Valuable assistance has been given by both Paiforce and the Government of India in the campaign against locusts that has been in progress for the past eighteen months. In addition to providing transport for the party of experts from India who operated successfully in Khuzestan in the spring of 1942, Paiforce provided a regiment of mechanised' cavalry for control measures in Khuzestan. During this year operations have been confined mainly to Persian Baluchistan and East Persia. Very valuable work was done by a company of mobile Indian infantry in the Bam-Kerman area, and the Government of India has now agreed to send a second company for work in the Birjand area. R.A.F. aircraft have also assisted in the control and destruction of locusts. 17. The Anglo-Iranian Institute of the British Council has been formally opened. It has been informally open for some weeks, has already proved itself a great success, and appears likely to make a valuable contribution to the improvement of Anglo-Persian relations. The demand to learn English far exceeds the teaching capacity of the staff. Russian Affairs. 18. It is reliably reported that the Russians have now placed garrisons in Mahabad (Sauj Bulagh) and Bokan, on the road between Mahabad and Saqqiz. Both these places are well south of the line that defines the southern limits of the Russian zone, but the Tripartite Treaty does not limit Russian troops to that zone. The Russians should, however, inform His Majesty’s Legation of movements of troops outside the zone originally laid down, and their explanation is awaited. Polish Affairs. 19.

Tehran, §th July, 1943. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 27 for the Period the 30^ June to the 5th July, 1943. Persian Affairs. Political. 1. The coming elections are the mam topic of interest in the press. In North Persia and in Isfahan political parties and candidates are active, but the mass of the people seems to be generally apathetic and resigned to the belief that the next Majlis will be of no greater benefit to them than the present. Blocks of votes are reported to be already on sale. Agitation is being carried on for the abolition of military governorships and the ban on political meetings, and political parties, expecting that their opponents may attempt to break up their meetings by force, are organising their own defensive bands. The Prime Minister has instructed all Ministries to warn their employees that Government officials must abstain from interference in the elections and from any attempt to influence their course. Officials of the Ministry of the Interior, whose responsibility it has been in the past to ensure that the Shah’s nominees were duly elected, are especially warned that if they offend in these respects, they will be discharged and punished. 2. The Prime Minister has not yet filled the vacant posts of Minister of the Interior and Minister of Justice. It is believed that he intends to retain the former portfolio himself. Economic. 3. The Majlis has passed a law authorising the engagement of six more American advisers for Dr. Millspaugh. 4. The Majlis has sanctioned a credit of 500 million rials to the Ministry of Food for the purchase of the harvest. See also Summary No. 26/43, paragraph 5. 5 . Mr. Sheridan, the American adviser to the Ministry of Food, has informed the Prime Minister that he does not wish to renew his contract, which expires in September. He further recommends the abolition of the Ministry of Food, which he considers to be no longer necessary owing to the plentiful harvest 1 | and the plans he has made to collect it, and the transfer of its functions to the Ministry of Finance.

The Majlis has passed a law authorising the Ministry for War to make purchases in America of equipment for the army up to the value of 1^ million dollars subject to the condition that payment is not made until after the 21 st March, 1945. This is in substitution of the Bill mentioned in Summary No. 12/43, paragraph 7, which was wrongly reported therein as having been approved by the Majlis. [43—60]2 Internal Security. Fars. 7. A serious encounter has taken place between a mixed force of Qashgai, Boir Ahmadi and Bakhtiari and the Persian garrison at Semirum, 20 miles south-west of Yazd-i-Khast, also known as Semirum. The Persian troops, who numbered about 500, are reported to have been routed and to have lost all their arms. ^ Otherwise there are no material changes. The Qashgai tribes are reported to be taking heavy toll of grain and sheep from the villages in the neighbourhood of their summer quarters and to have robbed a number of sheep from the Baseri tribe of the Khamseh confederation, the only tribe of that confederation that had given any support to Nasir. Nasir is reported to be south of Firuzabad with a band of 200-300, and Shahbakhti has reported to the Ministry for War that he hopes to bring him to bay. A column bas been sent in his direction. An unconfirmed report says that Nasir and his brother Khosrow have separated and that Nasir is trying to get to Boir Ahmadi country. Nasir, or more probably some of his friends in Tehran, has distributed leaflets calling on true patriots to stop the killing of innocent Persians that was resulting from the obedience of traitors to the policy of .foreigners. The Turkish Ambassador, who has for some time shown interest in the Qashgai question, considers that the tribe, being of Turki origin, should be allowed to migrate to Turkey. It is doubtful whether such a suggestion will commend itself to many Qashgais. Khorassan. 8 . The fighting between rival sections of the Zafaranlu Kurds of Khorassan, reported in Summary No. 25/43, paragraph 14, developed into serious disorder near Shirwan. The local Persian gendarmerie was too weak to restore order and the Russians were reluctant to allow the despatch of reinforcements, but finally agreed to the despatch of a small column of troops. At the time of Soulat es Sultaneh's rebellion in Khorassan in the spring (see Summaries Nos. 6/42, paragraph 13, and 8/42, paragraph 7) the section of these Kurds under FarajulLah Beg rose in sympathy, and the present disturbance is said to be due to no punishment having been imposed on them when the rebellion collapsed. Russian Affairs. 9. The Government of India Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau reports that a reconnaissance party of five Russian officers arrived in Zahidan on the 7th June from Kabul via Seistan and went on to Khwash. The object of this party was said to be to collect information about troop dispositions, communica tions, landing grounds and supplies. 10. The Soviet Embassy has not yet replied to the request for information regarding the move southwards of Russian troops reported in Summary No. 26/43, paragraph 18. According to information that has reached the Persian Ministry for War the strength of the troops at Mahabad is one regiment of cavalry with a detachment at Bokan. Patrols are said to have been sent out towards the Iraq frontier to warn Kurdish tribes that any transport of supplies to Iraq will be prevented by the Russians. Greek Affairs. 11 .

The Prime Minister has improved his position vis-a-vis the Deputies, among whom he has for the time being a majority of supporters but still many enemies. The differences of opinion regarding the choice of a Minister of the Interior have been solved by the appointment of the present Minister without Portfolio, Samii, to the Interior, and of Khalil Fahimi, lately Governor-General of Azerbaijan, as Minister without Portfolio. 2. The disaster to the Persian troops at Semirum—see paragraph 8 below— has shocked public opinion and, since the tribes acted with great brutality, less is likely to be heard in the future about the iniquity of fratricidal warfare against the tribes. If at the same time it brings home to the Shah and the General Staff a realisation of the state of demoralisation and inefficiency into which the army has fallen some good may come of it. Economic. 3. By his Regulation No. 12, the Director-General of Finance has transferred all Government cars and drivers to the charge of the Supplies Depart ment of the Ministry of Finance, which will allot transport to Government officials as required, giving first priority to those officials concerned with the collection of cereals and of revenue. If insufficient Government cars are available the Supplies Department may requisition or purchase private cars. The above regulation does not apply to cars belonging to the army, the gendarmerie or the police. 4 . The report in Summary No. 27/43, paragraph 4, that the Majlis had sanctioned the grant of a credit of 500 million rials to the Ministry of Food was premature.

In the current year’s budget allowance has been made for the grant of one free ration, on the same scale as to the soldiers, to each Persian officer. Married officers will be allowed to purchase three rations at a special rate of 140 rials each. Persian officers were not previously entitled to rations, even during operations, though doubtless they took them. [44—4]2 Internal Security. Kerman Province. well-known robber tribe of Buchakchis recently made a raid on the village of Baft, where, it is said, they seized 68 rifles and 4,000 cartridges and killed a few gendarmes. The raid is said to have been intended as a reprisal for the arrest of certain Buchakchi robbers. Pars. 8 . Ihe fighting at Semirum mentioned in last week’s Summary resulted in the complete overwhelming after three days’ fighting of the Persian garrison, whose strength is now known to have been about 900. All their arms and stores, which included rifles, machine guns, mortars and two mountain guns fell into the hands of the tribesmen in addition to a convoy of about eight lorries carrying money, personnel and stores, escorted by an armoured car, which was ambushed on its way to Semirum when the garrison was already surrounded. There is little doubt that treachery played some part in the disaster to the garrison. 9- The attacking tribesmen were principally from the Boir Ahmadi tribe, led by Abdullah Zarghampur, one of the tribal chiefs who fled from Tehran in March 1942 (see Summaries Nos. 11/42, paragraph 9 , and 12/42, paragraph 16) and has since been to all intents and purposes an outlaw. They were assisted by some of the Darashuri clan of the Qashgai, but as far as is known to the present time no other Qashgai clans are involved. Earlier reports that Bakhtiari tribes-j men took part have not been confirmed by later information. The strength off the attacking force is estimated by reliable informants as from 1,500 to ^ 4 , 000 . They were accompanied by an officer deserter from the Persian army, Captain Alavi, who is strongly suspected of being a German agent. There is also suspicion that there were Germans with the tribes. The principal motive of the Boir Ahmadi was, however, probably to seize the opportunity of acquiring rifles and ammunition. 10 . There was considerable anxiety in the townships of Shah Reza (Qumisheh) and Abadeh, which lay open to attack by the tribes, and even in Isfahan itself, where the garrison was reported to be so demoralised as to be unlikely to be capable of defending the town. No further aggressive action has yet been taken by the tribesmen and they may be dispersing. Quarrels over the loot would be a normal sequence to a successful action, but if the Boir Ahmadi are under the influence of Germans future action cannot be predicted. must oe expected that this disaster will have a serious effect on the whole tribal situation in south and south-west Persia. The Persian Government have not got sufficient troops to undertake the difficult operation necessary against the Boir Ahmadi, who defied even Reza Shah. They will probablv have to have recourse to the temporary raising of levies from tribes hostile to the Boir Ahmadi, an old and proved unsatisfactory expedient which usually results in the impoverishment of the countryside. These and other measures are now under consideration. They will inevitably take time. But it is essential that the I ersian Government should make plain its intention to do something and make a begmnmg with its measures, otherwise the trouble may spread, possibly affecting the oilfields and important lines of communication and certainlv handicapping the collection of the harvest. 12 . Shortly before the occurrence of Semirum, Shahbakhti’s forces had achieved a minor success against the small forces remaining with Nasir Qasho-ai, and the latter has asked that an officer should be sent to him to discuss terms of surrender. Russian A ffairs. 13. The Russian troops who were reported in Summary No 26 AS paragraph 18, to have arrived at Mahabad and Bokan, have now left those places and have returned to Maragheh in the Russian zone.

Whatever the activities of the Cabinet may be government of the country is not one of them. Disorder in all administrations and insecurity throughout to the country appear to be of little or no concern to the Prime Minister. It is said in some quarters that it is the policy of the Russians to produce disintegration and that for this purpose they find Soheily an admirable Prime Minister. If that is their policy they have good cause for satisfaction. There is considerable anxiety about the situation, but no co-operation to find a remedy. Those who see the remedy in close co-operation with Great Britain fear to come forward lest, after the war, Great Britain should again lose interest in Persia and they should be left to suffer from the venomous spite of so-called Nationalists or Communists. The weakness of the Government, the growing strength of the tribes, the demoralisation and inefficiency of the forces, and the bankruptcy of the finances are all producing a situation where a complete breakdown of the Government and of administration is possible. Chaos has gone so far that it is unlikely that it can be checked except by a firpi nand, untroubled by constitutional or democratic principles. In these conditions, the coming elections are more likely to produce disorder than a better Parliament. 2 The press publishes a statement by the Minister of the Court denying the rumours that the Court is endeavouring to influence the elections The denial is not likely to carry conviction, as it is generally believed, with some justification, that the agents of the Court are being active m those devious ways in which Persian elections can be influenced. There are likely to be lively scenes before the elections. For the Tehran seats alone there are said to be 3,000 candidates. , . p -rr i 3 . The Government has decided to abolish the Ministry of Food, the functions of that Ministry will be transferred to the Department of the Director- General of Finance, Dr. Millspaugh. I he Minister for Food, Tadayyun, is to remain in the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio. &gt; ersian Forces. 4 The Shah has decided to appoint Sartip Kajmaiy, an energetic^ elatively capable but rather intriguing officer, to be Chief of the General Staff i place of Sipahbod Yazdan Panah. He has also said that the Chief of the ieneral Staff will in future be responsible to the Minister for War In practice owever, it is improbable that there will be much difference. Ihe Shah will 0 , lt mue to issue orders to the Chief of the General Staff, unknown to the Minister for War when it suits him; and Sipahbod Yazdan Panah, whatever is appointment may be. he will probably continue to be the Shah s chief adviser, lut it is to be hoped that the personal relations of the Minister for \\ ar and he new Chief of the General Staff will be better than they were with his tFedecessor. ■ .' 44r :jn'o.

Pars. vu iu her V S } lUle chan g e m the situation. In the absence of General fenanbakhti, who has come to Tehran to report, there appears to be a truce between the forces of the Government and those of Nasir Qashgai. Armed tribesmen are reported to be joining Nasir from the tribes in their summer quarters and detached Persian forces in Karzin and Farrashband may be in clanger of being surrounded. It is possible that General Shahbakhti may not return. Ihe Government now hopes that Qavam ul Mulk will, if appointed Governor-General of Fars, extricate them from the difficulties into which their own and ^hahbakhti s folly has landed them. Qavam ul Mulk was, twentv years ago, a strong influence, in Fars as were his ancestors some generations before him. He is, with justification, demanding certain conditions and exten sive powers to deal with local questions, and in the chaos of weakness and intrigue that characterises the policy of the Government it is doubtful whether his requirements will have been approved before the situation has deteriorated beyond a point wffiere it is restorable by his influence. thf? northern part of the province the tribesmen's success at Semi rum has not been followed by more aggression than the usual lootino- of villages. 1 he Boir Ahmadi are reported to have returned to their own country, but bands of tribesmen have been seen in the vicinity of the road between Shah Reza and Abadeh. Traffic on the road has not yet been interfered with. Con voys of trucks for Russia will be escorted by Indian troops until the accumula tion at Bushire is cleared. 10 . The Boir Ahmadi under ARdullah Zarghampur have, according to a telegraphic report received from Hussein Quli of the Rustam section of &amp; the Mamassanni, given an ultimatum to the Khans of the Mamassanni threatenin 0, to occupy their lands unless they join the Boir Ahmadi. The latter are now, with their captures at Semirum, much better armed than the Mamassanni. The Mamassanni have hitherto held aloof from Qashgai and Boir Ahmadi intrigues, but only in the hope that their land claims would be satisfactorily settled by the Government. In this, as in most other matters, the Government delays decision. 11 . A report, as yet unconfirmed, says that the Boir Ahmadi are moving down towards the line Behbehan-Gach Saran, with a view to attacking detach ments of the Persian army wffiich are dispersed along the road for its protection. Bakhtiari. 12. Morteza Quli Khan, the newly appointed Bakhtiari Governor of Bakhtiari, has reported that Abul Qasim has surrendered to him. It appears to be, however, only a token surrender as Abul Qasim has been allowed to remain in Ardal for one month with his men. It seems that his many years in Tehran have not eliminated from Morteza Quli Khan the characteristics of the Lur tribes to which he belongs and that he is unable to resist the temptation of taking- advantage of the present situation and maintaining its suspense in order to force the Government to settle the land claims of his brother khans.

Tehran, 21 th July, 1943. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 30 for the Period 20£A-26£A July, 1943. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE Shah and the Government are conscious that the situation in the country is critical, and there has been much consultation and discussion, little decision and less action. Between a multitude of conflicting interests and advisers neither the Shah nor his Government can make up their minds, much less agree upon a common policy. Certain changes have, however, been made by the Shah in appointments in the forces, whose object is to tighten up discipline and instil more energy. In Tehran there is much adverse criticism of the Shah and his prestige is low. The proved inefficiency of the army and the Shah’s responsibility for it are the subject of much unfavourable comment. Personal attacks on him have been made in the press, and the offending papers have not been prosecuted. Scurrilous attacks are made with impunity on the Government in general and on individual Ministers. There is no respect for the Government and nothing but contempt for the Prime Minister even among his supporters. There are various movements afoot in Tehran and other towns, ostensibly connected with the coming elections, some of which might lead to disorder. 2 . The Government is still unable to decide on any policy for dealing with the increasingly serious disorder that has resulted from the success of the Boir Ahmadi tribes against the Persian forces. Any course of action has merely to be suggested to be certain of opposition from nearly everyone except the proposer. Economic. 3. A committee of experts, including representatives from Egypt. Iraq, Afghanistan Russia, Great Britain and Persia, is now sitting in Tehran to discuss and co-ordinate measures to be taken for the next season’s anti-locust campaign, which begins in September. Persian Forces. 4. It is understood that one motive inspiring the appointment of Sartip Razmara as Chief of the General Staff was a desire to encourage the younger and educated officers of the army, of whom one party follows Sartip Razmara. These officers, on the whole, are opposed both to the late Chief of the General Staff and to Sipahbod Ahmadi, the Minister for War, and some of them are opposed to the American advisers. But it may result in better co-operation between the General Staff and General Ridley, as Sartip Razmara in his last appointment of Commander of the Central Recruit Training and Administrative Depot did co-operate to some extent with General Ridley.2 5. Sarlashkar Aqevli has been removed from the command of the gendarmerie. Although he has the reputation of being an able and energetic officer, he has been obstructive and quite ineffective and has strongly opposed the grant of any authority to the American advisers to the gendarmerie. His removal may be an indication of an intention to allow them some scope. They have hitherto not been allowed to do anything. i &lt; t c Appointments — Military.

(v) Sartip Hassan Arfa to be commander of the Recruit Training and Administrative Depot. (vi) Sarhang Mahmud Khosrow Panah to be Chief of Police. Internal Security. 7. Disorder is increasing throughout the country. The obvious vacillation of the Government and the weakness of the Government forces have greatly encouraged the tribes to hope for a return of the happy lawless days of tribal autonomy. Fear of attack by the tribes has forced the Government to withdraw small detachments, and brigands have not failed to take the opportunity of pillaging. The prevailing insecurity must give scope to the intrigues of the Germans, pro-Axis sympathisers and those Persians who are anxious to embarrass Great Britain, even at the expense of their own country, to incite the tribes to greater excesses of destruction than would normally satisfy their natural instincts. Over large areas the crop is disappearing, though some of it will probably reappear later on the black market. A report from Persian sources, but considered reliable, is that four parachutists and a number of cases were seen to drop in Pars near Khaneh Zinian and that they were conveyed to Nasir Qashgai. Fars. 8 . It has been decided that General Shahbakhti will not return to Fars. He will be replaced by General Amanullah Jahanbani, an active, fairly honest and conciliatory officer, who is about the best of the bad choices available and the most likely to co-operate with Qavam-ul-Mulk. But the appointment of the latter as Governor-General with extended powers has not yet been approved by the Government. Apart from the usual inability of the Government to take any decision, opposition is being incited by Nasir’s pro-Axis friends, by others interested in creating disorder to embarrass the Government and the Allies, and by Qavam-ul-Mulk’s personal enemies. Meanwhile, the situation in Fars grows steadily worse. Villages are suffering heavily from the depredations of tribesmen who are carrying off or destroying crops. Tribes that have hitherto been willing to support the Government, or at least to remain neutral, are now being threatened by the Boir Ahmadi. Meanwhile, the troops are quite inactive. Bakhtiari. 9. In Bakhtiari the situation is quiet, but the tribe has as yet shown no indication of being willing to give active support to the Government. Certain minor chiefs are known to have sent congratulations to the tribal leaders who defeated the Persian forces at Semirum. Morteza Quli Khan appears to be establishing his influence in the tribe. Isfahan. 10. Disorder is spreading to the Isfahan-Yezd-Kerman road, where there have recently been several hold-ups. Kurdistan. 11 . While in Northern Kurdistan (Western Azerbaijan) belief that the Russians will themselves intervene to suppress Kurdish lawlessness keeps the tribes reasonably quiet, in Southern Kurdistan there is much restlessness. Twotroublesome chiefs, Mahmud Dizli and Mustafa Beg. one of the sons of Jaafar Sultan, who were under detention in Iraq, have recently returned to Persia and, together with Mahmud Kanisanani, a renegade Kurdish officer of Persian gendarmerie, are trying to incite the tribes and are demanding what amounts to autonomy for the Kurdish tracts in which they are interested—Avroman- Merivan. The Persian Government is in no situation to do more than temporise. An unconfirmed report says that a messenger from Nasir Qashgai and some •Hkkhtiari chiefs have been visiting the Sinjabi, Kalkhani, Jawanrudi, Babajam and Waladbegi tribes with a view to inducing them to combine against Govern ment. Another unconfirmed report says that the Jawanrudis have been warned to expect emissaries from Tehran to instruct them to prepare a landing ground where German aircraft will land arms.

THE political situation remains unstable, but without dramatic develop ments. The Prime Minister says that he intends to make several changes in the Cabinet with a view to giving it at least the appearance of being more energetic, more progressive and less venal. The Shah, who realises that his position has greatly deteriorated in recent months, is anxious, disturbed by the openly expressed criticism of himself, and, like his father, suspicious of most people except nonentities. He seeks counsel from many quarters, and there are some indications that advice given to him to refrain from intriguing and bribing and other un-kingly pursuits may bear a little fruit. He is concerned at the alleged growing influence of Qavam-es-Sultaneh, who he believes has Russian support, and who, he knows, is hostile to himself. He has been seeing something recently of the Deputy Dashti, who is now aspiring to be Prime Minister with the support of the Adalat party. Seyyid Zia-ed-Din Tabatabai has informed his friends that he is returning to Persia shortly. Whether in the face of Soviet and Court opposition he will be able to secure enough support to become Prime Minister is doubtful. The Government is far more concerned with consideration .of these matters than with the growing disorder in Ears. 2 . Although Persians as a whole are much more concerned with the internal affairs of the country than with the progress of the war, the fall of Mussolini had a profound effect on public opinion. For most it removed any remaining doubts as to the outcome of the war. Peace, some think, will come quickly. In an address at a recent levee the Shah said : c ‘ Peace approaches. Persia must now so act that in peace discussions she may take her rightful place and the rights of the Persian people be safeguarded.” Many are asking what the position of Persia will be after the war. How will she stand with the Allies, particularly with Great Britain ? The bogey of bolshevism looms larger, and there is a clearer sentiment that some effort should be made to conciliate Great Britain. In spite of this hostile elements and Nazi sympathisers are very active, and they find support among the many who for personal reasons do not desire to see order established or reforms put into practice that would limit their opportunities for , illicit profit. 3. The Deputy Nowbakht has announced his intention of interpellating the Government in a series of questions which are attacks on the Government, the Minister for War and the Allies, particularly the British. The Minister for War will reply for the Government. [*44—56] riicTiiTE^r, I 1 :K - ^ 1 ** - f - ./! — !2 Economic. 4. The Director-General of Finance has issued a regulation—No. 14—which declares that wheat and barley are a Government monopoly. The sale or movement of these grains, unless under the control of the Cereals and Bread Section of the Ministry of Finance, is absolutely forbidden. Grain hoarded or sold on the free market will be confiscated without compensation. The regulation also announces that on the 23rd November the price to be paid by the Government for grain will be reduced by 33J per cent., and that all hoards of grain found* after that date will be confiscated. It will require a better intentioned Govern ment and a more honest administration than exists at present to ensure the effective execution of this regulation. 5. As yet very little of the new harvest has been delivered to Government stores. In certain areas this is due to prevailing insecurity, in others to lack of transport, and in others to the reluctance of landlords to deliver. Tehran now holds about one month’s reserve. The Russians have delivered some 16,000 tons of the 25,000 tons of wheat promised. On the other hand they have taken from iAzarbaijan 14.000 tons and are asking for more. 6 . In the Budget Bill laid before the Majlis revenue is estimated at 1.890,795,096 rials and expenditure at 3,297,718,537 rials. As cuts have been made in the budgets submitted by Ministries the latter have now to prepare new detailed budgets. 7.

(iii) Muhammad Montazim to be Governor of Kasvin. Persian Forces. 9. Both General Ridley and Colonel Schwarzkopf report that since the new appointments mentioned in paragraph 6 of Summary No. 30 they have been receiving better co-operation from the Persian authorities. There is some indication, too, of an intention to remedy the present condition of indiscipline. As a result of the findings of the Court of Enquiry sent to Isfahan to investigate the Semirum disaster a Field General Court-Martial is to assemble to try a number of the officers concerned. Police. 10. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of General Radsar, a former Chief of Police, on the charge of being concerned in the murder of a prominent Parsi, Arbab Kaikhosru, in the time of Reza Shah. It is reported that he has escaped to Iraq. A ppointments — Military. 1 .—(i) Sarlashkar Amamullah Jahanbani (F.O. 100, M.A. 132) to be Com mander of the Forces in the south vice Sipahbod Shahbakhti. (ii) Sartip Qadar to command the Isfahan Division vice Sartip Nakchevan. Internal Security. 12 . In the address referred to in paragraph 2 the Shah referred to the prevailing insecurity. He impressed on representatives of the press present their duty to support the Government and in no circumstances to take the part of those in rebellion against the Government, who should and would be punished. Fars. ]3 The situation deteriorates rapidly in the absence of any effective mili tary or civil authority. The Boir Ahmadi have now attacked the Basht Bavi tribe, # a settled tribe closely allied to the Mamassanni, and the latter expect that they will next be attacked in revenge for having refused to join the Qashgais and Boir Ahmadis. The Qashgais are contenting themselves with pillaging villages, and they have not interfered with traffic on the road. They acquired 12 more rifles bv disarming a small Gendarmerie post 45 miles north-west of Shiraz. Othermarauding hands are taking advantage of the prevailing disorder and are raiding east of the Isfahan-Shiraz road. Nasir Qashgai is reported to have now with him some 700 riflemen in the Qarzin area. An uneasy truce appears still to exist between him and the Persian forces. 14. Meanwhile the Government, having announced the appointment of Qavam ul Mulk as Governor-General of Pars, makes excuse after excuse for delaying the fulfilment of the conditions which he regards as essential to his success. 1 here is very strong opposition to the appointment on the part of the powerful friends of Nasir Qashgai and all pro-Axis and anti-British elements. Large sums are being spent in bribery. Qavam ul Mulk’s honesty and pro-British sentiments are well known, and it is recognised that, if he were given the powers he asks for to deal with the situation in Pars, he would act in the interests of Persia whatever private interests were sacrificed. 15. Circumstantial stories seem to confirm the arrival of German para chutists in Pars—see Summary No. 30, paragraph 7. One report says they are now with Nasir’s brother. Khosrow, north of Ardakan. Khuzestan. 16. In view of the'anticipated threat from the Boir Ahmadis to the Behbehan-Gach Saran area and the possibility of their being joined by other Kuhgalu tribes, an additional battalion of Persian infantry is being sent from Tehran to Behbehan.

Tehran, \0th August, 1943. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 32 for the Period the 3rd to the 0th August, 1943. V Persian A if airs. Political. 1 . Events seem to be leading to a gradual, but ultimately complete,, breakdown of Government and-of the administration, or to a violent change dr regime. Insecurity, indiscipline and disorder are spreading. There is an absolute lack of confidence in the Government, and despair and pessimism are general because no better Government can be seen. Ali Mansur has refused to be a candidate for the premiership, and Soheily remains, because there is no one else, proving day by day his inability to check the increasing chaos, to which the electioneering manoeuvres of parties, some stirring up the working classes, others taking counter-measures, add confusion and disorder. Government employees, starving on inadequate pay, are ready to revolt. Genuine alarm has been caused by Dr. Millspaugh's regulation prohibiting any purchase of grain except from Government stores. Families have too little 'faith in the Government to be confident that there will be any grain in the Government stores to buy. Faith in the ability of Dr. Millspaugh, even with the very wide powers he has, to reduce the cost of living or improve the position of the poor and middle classes is waning, so that, while certain of the opposition of the rich, he cannot rely on much support from the poor. Confidence in the American advisers in all departments is decreasing even among those who saw in them a hope of salvation. The financial resources of the Government are nearly at an end. while increasing insecurity makes increasing demands on them. 2 . The one courageous and relatively strong man in the Government is the Minister for War, General Ahmadi. If he were given real authority over the army he might steady the tottering fabric, but the Shah and many others fear that he would then become too powerful, so the army, like the State, remains without any effective direction. The Shah loses favour daily with the people, and as an element of stability in the country the Crown now hardly counts for anything. Indeed, it would be hard to find anything stable in Persia to-day or any direction in which British influence can be applied to produce stability. 3. There is great unrest among under-paid Government employees. Strikes have already occurred in the Ministry of Justice, and others are threatened in other departments and services of public utility. Dr. Millspaugh, in a statement in the press, has appealed to Government employees to be patient a little longer with their hardships, of which he is fully aware. He explains that the State has, in fact, no money, but that he has appealed for help and hopes that it will be forthcoi St. S*t.4. A Bill has been laid before Parliament for the engagement of American assistants for Dr. Millspaugh to a total of sixty, including those already engaged and those whose engagement has already been approved. There is considerable, opposition to the Bill. 5. It is reported that, with a view to economy, the post of Governor-Deneral is to be abolished in all provinces except Pars, Khorasan, Kerman and Azerbaijan. 6 . Hooliganism and wounding by stabbing have become so common in Tehran that the Majlis passed a law with double urgency authorising the police fflfr to arrest or expel from Tehran persons guilty of, or from their past record known to be likely to commit, such offences. For almost the first time for two years adequate punishment has been given to a criminal. A man was publicly huhg m Tehran for robbery and murder. Economic. 7. By his regulation No. 15 the Director-General of Finance has made it illegal for anyone except the Cereals and Bread Section of the Ministry of Finance to move grain to or from Tehran by any means. Any gram found being transported by other than that agency will be confiscated, and a reward of 50 per cent, of the value of the grain at the Government price will be paid to the person responsible for its confiscation. ' 8 . Discontent with the quality of the bread on sale at the Government price has provoked riots at Kermanshah, Hamadan and Malayer. 9 . In a statement published in the press Dr. Millspaugh says that, as a result of investigations he has made personally, he can categorically deny the reports that wheat has been bought by the British. A ppointments — Civil. 10 . —(i) Muhsin Sadr (F.O. 180, M.A. 249) to be Minister of Justice. (ii) Qasim Meikadeh to be Governor of Shahriza.

(v) Hussein Muhiman to be under-secretary in the Ministry of Finance. Persian Forces. H A commission consisting of the Prime Minister, the Minister for War, the Chief of the General Staff, General Yazdan Panah and three Deputies recently met to consider what powers the Shah could legitimately exercise under the Constitution over the army. The finding was that his powers were limited to the right of approval in certain cases only of proposals made by the Minister for War and that the latter was fully responsible for the army. I he Shah authorised the Prime Minister to announce in a secret session of Parliament that the General Staff would in future be subordinate to the Minister for War. As a sequel the Ministrv for War drafted a regulation for the Shah s approval defining the duties of the General Staff and departments of the Ministry for War and detailing how the responsibility of the General Staff to the Minister for War was to work in practice. The Shah refused to sign it or to allow the Minister for War to have full authority over the General Staff in practice. But the Minister for War was ordered to tell press and Parliament that he was fqliy responsible for the army. It is evident that the Shah intends to continue dealing direct with the General Staff and to issue orders without reference to the Minister for War.

The Commander of the Persian forces at Senneh has reported that Kurdish tribes under Mahmud Dizli and Mahmud Kanisanani (see Summary No. 30, paragraph 11 ) attacked his posts west of Senneh and were repulsed with loss. As the Persian military authorities are anxious to avoid getting embroiled with the Kurdish tribes negotiations have been opened with the leaders to endeavour to reach a peaceful settlement. Zahidan. 17. On the 12 th August six U.K.K.C. and two privately-owned lorries were ! held up at Hormuk 38 miles north of Zahidan by four armed robbers alleged to be Afghans. The drivers report the loss of 28,000 rials and three sacks of sugar. A telephone line has been constructed by the Government of India to connect the Persian gendarmerie post at Kuh i Sangi with the British frontier levy post at Robat in British Baluchistan to ensure better co-operation in the interception of raiders. Russian Affairs. 18. For some time past the Russians have maintained a garrison at Fariman, 40 miles south by east of Meshed. It is now reliably reported that it has been withdrawn. 19. It is still a matter for conjecture how far the Tudeh party enjoys Russian support. In Azerbaijan, oddly enough, the Russians appear to leave it to itself. In Meshed, on the other hand, at an election meeting attended by about 1,500 people, sweets were handed round by a Russian girl. Qavam es Sultaneh, who, reactionary though he is, is popularly supposed to be regarded with favour by the Russians, is now flirting with the Tudeh party.//toft « M o. . 1 . 1 , v i » i ° v ’ v ' ; ' THIS DOCUMENT^ PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S^GOYERWMENT - y ^ © PERSIA.

Tehran, 11 th August, 1943. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 33 for the Period \0th-MSth August, 1943. Persian Affairs. Political. THE position of the Government is so weak that they dare not at present answer the interpellation of the Deputy Nowbakht, fearing defeat. There is an active party inside and outside the Majlis working for the overthrow ot the Prime Minister and his replacement by Muhammad Said, the Minister for loreign Affairs, an honest but weak man, favoured by the Shah, who favours only wea men This party is likely to vote against the Government, irrespective ot the merits of the case. The Prime Minister admits that he only maintains his position because he does nothing and commits himself to no definite policy. Ihe opposition to the American advisers from merchants and those Deputies who would suffer from reforms continues to be very strong, but it has produced a minor reaction in their favour. Economic. 2. By his Regulation No. 16 the Director-General of Finance modifies the restriction imposed on the transport of grain by his Regulation No. 14 by allowing the movement of grain between villages. Regulation No. 14 made the sale of grain a Government monopoly and prohibited the movement of gram except under Government control. Householders are also authorised to purchase flour or grain from Government stores on presentation of their bread coupons up to a maximum of 75 kilog. per annum for a child 150 for an adult and 250 for a working man. The amount that can be purchased at any one time will depend on the reserves available in Government stores. Landowners living m towns will be permitted to import from their estates to the towns in which they reside sufficient wheat for the consumption of their families. 3 These concessions have done something to allay the public anxiety cieated hv Resrulation No 14 In a communique to the press. Dr. Millspaugh gives some explanltion of his plans for feeding the population He attributes public anxiety to lack of confidence in the Government and to doubts as to the Allies intentions regarding the purchase and export of grain He expresses hope that if the Government and the Majlis su PP°’ 4 his measures he will be able to establmh confidence in the Government, and says that he is satisfied that two of the Allies have no intention of buying grain in Persia. Russia, on the other hand, was asking for wheat and barlev for her own needs, but Russia could not expect grain to be delivered to her until'the needs of the Persian people had been assured.

A meeting has taken place between General Jahanbani, Nasir Qashgai, Khosrqw his brother and Morteza Quli Khan, Governor of Bakhtiari, the outcome of which was that Khosrow agreed to come to Tehran to discuss terms of submission for himself and his brother with the Government. A British officer was present at the meeting. It has been agreed that while these negotiations are in progress there will be a truce between the Qashgai and the troops the latter undertaking to make no movement. Nasir has promised that he will restrain the Qashgai tribes from committing robbery during the period of the truce. It is unlikely that it is the intention of Nasir to do more now than play for time until the downward migration of the tribes, which is likely to begin a month before the usual date, is complete. The arrival of Qavam-ul-Mulk in Shiraz, combined with the news of recent German defeats, probably persuaded Nasir that it was time to play for safety. The effectiveness of the Qavam’s appointment has already been demonstrated by the strength of the attempts that are now being made by Nasir’s friends and other anti-British parties to secure his withdrawal. 9. The Boir Ahmadi who attacked the Persian garrison at Ardekan (see Summary No. 32, paragraph 13), disconcerted by the inconsistency of the garrison in refusing to surrender, withdrew on the approach of a relieving battalion after sacking part of the town. The Persian troops claim that the Boir Ahmadi suffered some twenty casualties, killed and wounded. Kurdistan. 10 . The bombastic threats of Mahmud Dizli and Mahmud Kanisanani have come to little. Recent reports from Kurdistan are that the tribes who were threatening the Persian forces west of Senneh have dispersed. Tehran, \§th August, 1943.■K 'W PY THIS DOCUMENT IS THE J*.

Tehran, ^th August, 1943. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache s Intelligence Summary No. 34 for the Period Yith to ttrd August, 1943. Persian A ffairs. Political. THE Prime Minister now considers that he can count on a majority in the Majlis to give the Government a vote of confidence on the Xowbakht interpella tion which is to be taken on the 24th August. But after that it is believed that the Majlis intends to demand some changes in the Cabinet, and the continuance of a majority in favour of the Prime Minister seems doubtful. 2. The arrest of the German agent, Franz Mayer, in Tehran by the British security authorities has caused considerable alarm to those Persians who had been plotting with him. Several of the more notorious among them have since the arrest made attempts through third parties to ascertain from the legation whether there is any evidence against them. Drastic action by the British authorities is expected. In the press and elsewhere there is noticeable the beginning of a realisation that it is time to give the Allies, particularly Americans and British, some reason to think less badly of Persia. 3. Alarmed by information which they received from Persian as well as British sources that German agents intended to try to destroy the railway, the Persian Government has issued a proclamation announcing a reward of 50.000 rials for information leading to the arrest of any German in Persia without the permission of the Persian Government. ' 4. The weakness of their forces is obliging the Persian Government to accept a situation in tribal areas which in the years before Reza Shah was a constant cause of insecurity, resulting in loss of revenue and production and hindering development. That situation was the existence of super-tribal chiefs commanding the allegiance of powerful tribal confederations. Reza Shah realised that no unification and no development of Persia were possible while these chiefs were a law unto themselves in vast areas, and he removed them all. To-day Morteza Quli Khan is again chief of all the Bakhtiari, and Khosrow is to be chief of all the Qashgai-Ilkhanis in all but name. While the Persian forces and the authority of the Persian Government remain as weak as they are, collection .of revenue and of grain in the large areas they control are at the mercy of those chiefs. And unless the Persian forces and the authority of the Central Government are greatly strengthened, those parts of Persia dominated by the tribes may lapse into the condition prevailing in 1910. 5 . In Summary No. 26/43, paragraph 3, reference was made to the arrival in Persia from Iraq of a venerable Shia divine. Haji Agha Hussein Qumi. He has visited Tehran and Meshed and has now returned to Tehran. Much has been made of him during his visit, not only by those who respect his standing in religion. He has been fawned on. flattered and encouraged by merchants, politicians and others for their private ends. He is now embarrassing the Govern ment by demands regarding the wearing of the veil and the administration of Shrine endowments which would, if granted, tend to re-establish the power of the -rpjcMlSj aiilrT.— 21 ] &gt; ’ .,-FtCE! 1156 Ihe members of the committee to supervise the elections in Tehran have ma ookx president is Seyyid Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai (F.O. 205; M.A. 28o). The committee has conveyed to the Government its opinion that the continuance of the military governorship in Tehran is incompatible with free elections. Economic. 0k 7. An official statement in the press states that engagements for the delivery i 1 ) ^ l ailc M 01 'ds for the current year now total 400,000 tons, of which 520,000 tons will suffice for the needs of this year, and 80,000 tons will be held , in reserve for the coming year. In fact, however, only about 16,000 tons of this year s harvest have as yet reached the Government stores, of which 8,000 have been collected m Khuzestan. 'j 11 latest public monthly report Dr. Millspaugh estimates the deficit m the budget for the current year at 1,500 million rials without allowing for any increase in the salaries of Government employees. Some increase is, however i niV u ri r ly a 1 d ? lltted t0 be essential. An increase of 50 per cent, would increase t e budget deficit to 1,900 million rials. Such a sum cannot be raised during the current year by the Persian Government by taxation or by internal loans. The . co „ me iax P ld ’ even if if were to become law immediately, would not be effective for some time. The Government already owes to the National Bank the sum of 3,200 million rials and the capacity of the bank to lend is almost exhausted Ihe Government has no alternative but to ask the Allies for a loan sufficient to covei the deficit of 1 900 million rials. In the meantime they were asking for an advance against that loan of 500 million rials for the purchase of grain and m order to meet current expenditure they had asked for and obtained from the A.i.U.C. an advance of the current year’s royalties.

But by his appointment as Governor of Firuzabad Khosrow is in effect recognised as chief of all the Qashgai, and if he has the character to consolidate his position he may not in the future easily be brought to submit to the Persian Government. The surrender of their arms by the Qashgai is not part of the present settlement. On the other hand, he is young, even for his 22 years, and, j^hough now a popular figure in the tribe, he may not be able to restrain them robbery for long. 13. Khosrow, while in Tehran, expressed to members of the British Legation his sincere regret for past misdeeds. He made no secret of his and INasir’s association with Germans, but denied that until recently there had been more than one with the tribe. He admitted that Nasir had prepared a landing-ground for German aircraft, and that the Germans with them had told them that troop carrying aircraft would shortly arrive with parties to assist the Qashgai to damage British interests. He reported the arrival of parachutists with explosives and that the Qashgai had assisted them with transport. All Germans, he claimed, had now left Qashgai territory. Bakhtiari. 14. Germans, probably those who have recently landed by parachute, are known to have joined Abul Qasim and Captain Alavi, the Persian Army deserter who is with him. Abul Qasim, influenced undoubtedly by the apparent defection from the German cause of Nasir Qashgai and his brother and by the same cause that had influenced them—the obvious hopelessness of a German victory—has himself come into Isfahan and surrendered, on what terms is not yet known, to the G.O.C., Persian troops. With his elimination from Bakhtiari the danger of that tribe engaging in anti-British activities is small. Most of the Bakhtiari khans are now anxious to prove their pro-British sentiments. Kuh-i-Galu. 15. The third member of the anti-British combination among the tribes of the south organised by German agents, Abdullah Zarghampur of the Boir Ahmadi, has now sent in messages to Qavam-ul-Mulk at Shiraz to the effect that he is prepared to negotiate with him. Abdullah’s younger brother, Khosrow, is also negotiating with the Persian authorities and offering to take action against his brother. Kerman. 16. There has recently been much brigandage on or near the Isfahan-Yezd- Kerman road. During the week 10th to 15th August lorries were held up and robbed on five separate occasions. The insecurity is probably nothing more than the result of the prevailing disorder in South Persia. A few successful minor actions by the Persian forces against brigands in the vicinity of the Isfahan- Shiraz road has driven them further afield.

ANXIETY regarding the Government’s ability to secure the nation’s bread supplies during the coming year is growing, and they are being severely heckled by the Deputies and the press on this account. Much pressure is being brought on the Government to relax the regulation that forbids the acquisition by private individuals in towns of grain other than from Government stores against their ration coupons. There is still strong opposition to the new Income Tax Bill, and an unrelenting campaign is carried on in the press against Dr. Millspaugh and his mission. 2. The Deputy Nowbakht failed to present himself at the Majlis on the day appointed for the Government’s answer to his interpellation. He has gone into hiding. 3. His Majesty’s Minister and the Soviet Charge d’Affaires jointly presented to the Prime Minister on the 29th August a list of some 150 Persians who are known on reliable evidence to have been recently plotting with German agents against the Allies, and demanded their arrest. The Prime Minister agreed that they should be arrested. 4. The Minister of Education, Dr. Ali Akbar Ziassi, has resigned from the Cabinet from dislike of the intrigues with which the Government is surrounded. 5 . The four more respectable members of the Election Supervisory Committee for Tehran (see Summary No. 34/43, paragraph 6 ) resigned immediately after their election. This is interpreted as an expression of their opinion that the elections would be no more free than formerly. 6 . The tone of the press has recently been more conciliatory towards the Allies while being severely critical of the Government and the internal situation. The victory of the Allies is generally accepted as a foregone conclusion. There is much local gossip about differences of view between Russia on the one hand and Great Britain and America on the other. Economic. 7. The Council of Ministers has published a decree forbidding the slaughter of cows and of working oattle. 8 . The Majlis has passed a law authorising the Ministry of Finance to sell to the Government of India 118,718 kilog. of Persian nickel coins not now in circulation, and to accept payment in aluminium and copper for the minting of bronze coins.

The majority of those Persians whose arrest has been demanded by His Majesty’s Minister and the Soviet Charge d'Affaires—see Summary No. 35/43, paragraph 3—have been arrested. All army officers on the list were arrested within a few hours on the orders of the Minister for War. In view of the promptitude sho^n by the minister and the officers to whom his orders were issued it is unfortunate that Indian troops in Isfahan, who were not intended to act unless the Persian authorities failed to do so, should r through a misapprehension and no fault of theirs, have taken steps to make the arrests themselves and, finding that they had already been made, insisted on taking the officers into their own custody. This causec|^ 6 nsiderable ill-feeling among Persian officers in Isfahan and was bitterly resented by the Chief of the General Staff, who regarded it as an insult to himself and to the Persian army as all arrests of military officers had already been effected. It led to some very violent anti-British articles in the press, the obvious purpose of which is to inflame the feelings of Persian officers against the British. There is little doubt that this campaign has been inspired by the Chief of the General Staff, w T ho announced his resignation (which he has since withdrawn) as a protest against the intervention of Indian troops. The Chief of the General Staff leads a strongly nationalistic party in the army, and he had been hoping to restore some of its lost morale. 2. Apart from the above the general effect of the arrests has probably been good, although there has not yet been time fully to appreciate public reactions. That some arrests would be made has been expected for some time and only in a few cases has any surprise been caused by the selection of those to be arrested. But the arrests may be made an excuse for working up an agitation against the Prime Minister and his Government, whose position is already weak. The Shah is angry with the Prime Minister for ordering the arrests without previous reference to him. 3 . Attempts have been made to create disturbances in Tehran and to persuade the shopkeepers to close their shops, chiefly by merchants interested in provoking demonstrations against Dr. Millspaugh’s wheat regulations and his Income Tax Bill. The situation was favourable because there was public anxiety about the restrictions on the purchase of wheat ; political parties have been exciting popular feeling over the elections ; the mullahs, led by Haji Hussein Qumi have been trying to work up religious fervour, and there was some agitation over the arrests, particularly over the unsuccessful attempt to arrest a prominent and notorious mullah, Seyyid Abul Qasim Kashani. [45— 66 ]4. The Ministry of the interior has published a communique announcing that discovery had recently been made of a German espionage and sabotage organisation which was preparing a revolt against the Government and planning for the destruction of railway bridges and tunnels. As a number of Persians was suspected of collaborating with the Germans the Government had arrested^ them in the interests of the nation and in fulfilment of their treaty obligations .* 1 The public is requested to give information to the police regarding the Above- mentioned organisation or the whereabouts of Germans. 5. There has, for some time past, been considerable ill-feeling between tfTh Shah and Qavam es Sultaneh, and the latter’s subsidised papers have made many attacks on the Shah. There was recently a meeting between the two and it is reported that friendly relations have been established. The Shah is also reported recently to have met one of the leaders of the Tudeh party. As this party and Qavam es Sultaneh are both supposed to enjoy Russian backing the Shah is now believed to be seeking Russian support. One theory has it that this is against the return of Seyyid Zia ed Din Tabatabai which is reported to be imminent. 6 .

Qashgai brigandage has almost ceased, but it is appearing to be increasingly likely that Nasir’s overtures to the Persian Government through his brother, Khosrow, has no object but to gain time for the downward migration of the tribe. Nasir has refused the invitation of the Governor-General and the Persian General Officer Commanding to come to Shiraz. There is good evidence that there are still Germans in Qashgai territory and that Nasir is now sheltering the Deputy Nowbakht and his son who are among those whose arrest has been demanded. Nasir realises that in face of the weakness of the Government and its forces he has a strong position and it is improbable that he will abandon it until compelled to do so by force or the threat of force.

Tehran, Vath September, 1943. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 37, for the period 7th September to \Mh September, 1943. Persian Affairs. Political. 1 . Persia declared war on Germany on the 9th September. The declaration was approved by the Majlis by 74 votes from 77 Deputies present, had on the whole a good press and, although it cannot be said to have created any wild enthusiasm, it has generally been received with mild approval and hope of favours to come by the public, whose fears were allayed by the Prime Minister s announce ment that the Allies had given assurances that Persia would not be required to enter into any additional military or economic engagements. Many have expressed regrets that Persia did not earlier become a belligerent, but only in a few cases are these regrets sincere. The consideration uppermost in many minds is that Persia’s association with the United Nations puts her in a stronger position vis-d-tis Russia after the war and may lead to some guarantees of her independence. . 2. As justification for the declaration of war at this stage the Prime Minister in his speech to the Majlis mentioned the discovery of the German organisation whose object it is to raise revolts against the Government and to damage communications and he referred to the recent arrival of parachutists in Qashgai territory. This will serve Persians as sufficient defence against the charge that they sat on the fence until the victory of the Allies was^ quite certain and. that their only object was to secure representation at the Peace Conferences. 3 . The Shah has sent telegrams to the President of the U.S.S.R., the President of the United States and His Majesty The King announcing Persia’s adherence to the pact of the United Nations and giving assurances that it is his firm intention to continue the efficacious co-operation already given by Persia towards the common victory. 4. The Prime Minister, who had been temporarily elated by his discovery that he had the unsuspected courage to take so definite a line as to order the arrest of a number of prominent Persians and to face the Majlis with a declaration of war, is again depressed by the Shah’s evident displeasure and by his encouragement of the opposition to the Prime Minister. 5. Although, particularly in the army, some attempt has been made to so read the belief that the Allies selected for arrest—see Summary No. 36, paragraph 1 —particularly patriotic Persians who stood in the way of their plans, the public remains unexcited and the press, after a few outbursts, has adopted a moderate tone. There are indications that the effect of the arrests will be o-ood, and that the result will be a decrease in the opposition to Allied, particu- larfy to’ British, interests and encouragement to genuine supporters of a policy of co-operation. [46—10] £2. O j M*4 ) 6 . The capitulation of Italy, although not unexpected by Persians, was accepted by most as impressive proof of the certainty of Germany’s complete defeat and reduction to impotence. The main concerns of Persians, however, are their own economic situation—high prices, the supply of bread, insecurity— and Russian post-war policy towards Persia. 7. In most parts of the country the elections, which should have been completed before the end of this month, have been temporarily postponed on one pretext or another. ' 8 . The Minister for War has been ordered by the Shah to form a committ^ under the patronage of Queen Fowzieh for the collection of funds for Russian wounded. It is believed that the suggestion that the formation of such a committee would be appropriate came from the Russians. Economic. 9.

A rmy. .Pd The ,. p03t f of Minister for War (General Ahmadi), Under-Secretary of State (Brigadier Ansan) and Chief of the General Staff (Brigadier RiaziV are now held by men who ha\e consistently advocated close co-operation with Grea* Britain and support of the American advisers. Generals Riazi and Ansari are honest and educated men, but it remains to be seen whether they are strong3 enough to impose their ideas on the army. A beginning is to be made by clearing out some of the old and useless officers, but there will still remain a number of educated younger officers of strongly nationalistic ideas who are opposed to the grant of authority to American advisers. F was re P or ted in last week’s Summary of Intelligence, the then Chief . 1 le General Staff, Brigadier Razmara, had resigned as a protest against the intervention of Indian troops in the arrests of Persian military officers in Isfahan auid had later withdrawn his resignation. But a few days later he refused to ®cept certain regulations drawn up by the Ministry for War to implement the Shah s decree making the General Staff subordinate to the Ministry—see Summary 35 / 43 , paragraph 11 . His principal objection was to the transfer of the Officer Personnel (Military Secretary’s) Department from the control of the General Staff to the direct control of the Minister for War. The Shah, who had most unwillingly agreed to the subordination of the General Staff to the Ministry for War, was with difficulty persuaded that Brigadier Razmara should be relieved of his appointment. His removal is a disappointment to a number of ambitious youngish officers, as Razmara had intendec of all officers senior to him and his frienc for some time. to work for the compulsory retirement s. These may be a disturbing element 14. A Bill will shortly be laid before the Majlis asking for approval of the engagement of General Ridley and not more than thirty American officers as military advisers to the Persian army. The Persian Government does not expect to get as many as thirty officers immediately. A ointments — Military. ..15.—(i) Sartip Ali Riazi to be Chief of the General Staff vice Sartip Haji Ali Razmara (M.A. 243) relieved.

Nasir Qashgai now pleads that it is Qavam-ul-Mulk’s presence in Shiraz that prevents his coming in to discuss terms. He has clearly been encouraged to hold out by the conciliatory reception given to Khosrow in Tehran, which he has interpreted—rightly—as an indication of the Government’s weakness. The Minister for War is now visiting Shiraz to examine the situation and the possibility of offensive action against Nasir in consultation with the local authorities. Bakhtiari. 17. Abul Qasim has now come to Tehran, and it is to be hoped that his followers will now disperse unless the Persian army deserter, Captain Alavi, can find money to hold them together. They are now collected at Auragun, where there may still be some Germans. Captain Alavi has also been making overtures to surrender. Morteza Quli, in spite of the inevitable intrigues of his brother khans, seems to be slowly making good as governor. There is a fair degree of peace in the greater part of Bakhtiari and grain is coming satisfactorily into the collecting centres. Khuzistan. 18. Armed Arabs under a leader, Zumail, have been for some time committing robberies with violence in the neighbourhood of Khorramshahr and Abadan. On the 8 th September there was an encounter between them and the local gendarmerie which resulted in casualties on both sides and in the gendarmerie remaining in control of the area. Some local authorities expect retaliation bv the Arabs. Tehran, IMh September, 1943.f\Ll LL O 0 p Y THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. SECRET.

PERSIA’S entry into the war continues to have a good press, and public opinion on the whole seems to be relieved that it has received a clear direction. There appears already to be an improvement in the public attitude towards the Allies, perhaps even a little pride at being—as Persians see ib—ranged alongside them in the march to victory. 2. The Government has isued a communique proclaiming— (i) That laws and penalties applicable to a state of war will now be in force throughout the country. The army is responsible for publishing details and particularly those concerned with the safety of roads, railways and telegraphic communications. (ii) That to have relations with or to give assistance to the enemy will be considered as high treason and punished accordingly. (iii) Any incitement or action that leads to an interruption of road or rail communications or to the sabotage of national factories, workshops, mines or other economic resources will be punished in accordance with the laws in force in w&amp;rtime. (iv) The dissemination of false news, opposition to the foreign policy of Persia, insults to the officials of the Persian Government or of Ailied Powers and all actions that may disturb public order are absolutely forbidden. (v) It is the duty of all officials of the Government to co-operate with the officials of the Ministries of War and of the Interior who are charged with the responsibility for the execution of these regulations. 3. Soheily’s Cabinet is a little more stable. The Shah is said to be on better terms with the Prime Minister and the latter has gained some confidence. But the Government will soon again be m difficulties unless public anxiety about the bread supply can be allayed. It is now acute, and an interpellation of the Government on this matter has been tabled. Differences of opinion between Dr. Millspaugh and the Government are known to the public and faith in Dr. Millspaugh as a supplier of bread or a reducer of the cost of living is not high. 4. There has been a regrettable advertisement in the press of disagreement between Dr. Millspaugh and the Minister of the Interior, Tadayyun. The latter took exception to the issue of an order by Dr. Millspaugh for the formation of a commission to take a new census in Tehran which he considered necessary in order to check the number of bread coupons in issue. The Minister of the Interior pointed out that the taking of a census was his business and not that ofDr. Millspaugh. The latter replied to the Minister’s protest in a rather pro vocative letter which he published in the press. This called forth a retaliatory reply, also published in the press. This gives further material to those of Dr. Millspaugh’s critics who accuse him of putting too wide an interpretation on the powers given to him and of acting hastily and obstinately against the advice of the competent Persian authorities. That Dr. Millspaugh, in the task before him, should arouse strong opposition was inevitable. That he should have / secured no greater degree of co-operation than he has done is regrettable. 5. The Shah has announced his intention of visiting Khorassan shortly. Economic. 6 . The Majlis has passed a Bill granting a credit of 500 million rials for the assistance of under-paid Government employees. It is understood that the assistance is to be given in kind rather than in cash. 7. The Bill which has been before the Majlis since March—see Summary No. 12/43, paragraph 3 —for the issue of Treasury Bonds to the limit of 500 million rials has now been approved. 8 .

IT can now be said that there is in Tehran and in some, at least, of the pro vincial towns a considerable improvement in public sentiment. There is less unrest, less subversive intrigue and more respect for the Government. This is due in some degree to the arrests recently made and in lesser degree to Persia's declaration of war. That a Persian Government, dependent on Majlis support, under the premiership of Soheili, should have had the courage to arrest prominent Persians came as a salutary surprise which has had a steadying effect on the public and has instilled some fear into the trouble-makers. Many of those arrested were widely known to be hostile to the Allies and to be opponents of the present regime, and their arrest, besides strengthening the Government, has made opposition to ico-operation with the Allies less popular. The same result has followed from Persia’s declaration of war. The Prime Minister has gained confidence and is beginning to regard himself as a strong and courageous man. He talks of remaking his Cabinet. A ppointments — Civil. 2. —(i) Mehdi Fatimi (F.O. 70; M.A: 92) to be Governor-General of the 8 th (Kerman) Ustan.

Part of the equipment demanded by General Ridley from the United States for the Persian army—see Summary No. 12 , paragraph 7—has now arrived in Persian Gulf ports. Full details are not yet available, but it is known to include 200 lorries, 100,000 pairs of boots, and some infantry field engineering equip ment. 4. The text of the Bill for the engagement of thirty American military officers for the reform of the administration of the Persian army, referred to in Summary No. 37/43, paragraph 14. is attached as an appendix. It was laid before the Majlis on the 19th September. 5 . A Bill has been laid before the Majlis transferring from military to civil courts jurisdiction over officers and men of the army for offences against the civil law.

Internal Security. Fars. 8 . There has been a meeting at Ardekan between the Minister for War and Nasir and Khosrow Qashgai, at which Abdullah Zarghampur of the Boir Ahmadi was present. Nasir handed over four machine guns captured from the Persian army and promised to surrender certain other Persian Government arms, but not rifles. Various promises were also made. Khosrow went to Shiraz after the meeting, but reports available up to the present do not indicate that Nasir showed any intention of leaving tribal territory. • Since the Persian forces are still too demoralised to justify an ultimatum to Nasir, the negotiations on both sides were r presumably of a temporising character. Meanwhile, discussions have also been taking place between the Minister for War and Qavam ul Mulk as regards future 0 policy. For the immediate future and until the Persian forces are in a fit state to take action it does not amount to much more than that attempts should be made to ^undermine Nasir’s influence among the tribes and to prevent other tribes from i joining the hostile confederation. As it is Nasir’s object that either he or his brother should be permanently retained as the official head of the Qashgai con federation or even of all the tribes of Fars, it is probable that for some time to come his aim will be to prove that he can control the tribes, and this may result in a decrease of lawlessness. A body of the Qashgai is said to be co-operating with a column of Persian troops who have been sent to act against brigands, reported to be Boir Ahmadi, who have been active in the neighbourhood of Dasht Arjin. Kuh i Gain. 9. There is considerable unrest in Kuh i Gain territory from Janiki down to the Gach Saran area, mainly due to the fact that there is no Government or recognised tribal authority in the whole area. Russian Affairs. 10 . Between the 15th August and the 11 th September 5,362 tons of Aid to Russia supplies were delivered to the Soviet authorities by the Meshed-Zahidan route. 11 . Major-General Kargin has succeeded Major-General Koroliov as chief of the Soviet Transportation Directorate. Fie has been recently promoted. Chinese Affairs. 12 . Arrangements had been made for the despatch by the Zahidan-Meshed route of a limited quantity of lease-lend supplies for China, on the understandiim that' the Soviet authorities had agreed to the onward transport of these through Turkestan. Convoys amounting to 520 trucks had already been despatched from Zahidan to be handed over to the Soviet authorities at Meshed or Turbat i Haidari, but the Soviet Government has refused to take them over on the grounds that they have as yet come to no agreement with the Chinese Government. The convoys are to return to India. Tehran, 27th September, 1943.3 Appendix I.

Fie is standing for Parliament and will probably be elected. His supporters, who do not as yet include many men of importance, are making much of his arrival, but on the whole it does not appear to ha^ made much public stir. . „ ^ , 2.

A ppointments — Civil. 3 —(i) Ahmad Khiradpishem, to be Farmandar of Shahsavar, (ii) Abbas Tabatabai, to be Farmandar of Shahabad.

Economic. 4. In his report for the months of June-August Dr. Millspaugh specifies eight conditions essential to the successful work of the American Financial Mission : — (1) Adequate powers; (2) Support from the Government; (3) Support from the Majlis; . ( 4 ) The land-holders and the merchants must refrain from becoming the encouragers and instigators of opposition and unrest; ( 5 ) The newspapers must be honest with the American mission; ( 6 ) Order and security; (7) Co-operation and support from the Allied Governments; ( 8 ) The American Mission must be adequately manned. In Dr. Millspaugh’s opinion only the first of these approaches fulfilment. He complains of lack of support from the Government, of obstruction from the Majlis, land-holders, merchants and press, and of a lack of order and security. In the matter of co-operation and support from the Allied Governments he indicates three aspects where he thinks that co-operation might be better (i) In prompt payment of their legal debts to the Persian Government; (ii) In facilitating the collection and transportation of grain; (iii) In the maintenance of a strong and effective administration, which ' implies that the organisations and agents of the Persian Government must be free to function in all parts of the country in the collection jzi revenue, the purchase of grain, the supplying of food, and the execution generally of Persian laws. [46—67] * U)It is understood that Dr. Millspaugh has no complaint against the British Government in these respects. It is, however, well known that the Russians offend in all of them. 5. It has been settled in principle that the United States Government will come to the rescue of the Persian Government in the matter of the current year s budget deficit. Some details remain to be settled, but Dr. Millspaugh is now c 011- ^ fident that he will have the necessary funds to meet the Government’s obligations ^ 6 . The bread supply of the capital is still causing considerable anxiety. Arrivals of wheat are insufficient to meet current requirements and the small reserves of wheat are nearing exhaustion. With the approach of winter the difficulties of collecting from outlying districts will increase. 7. The Majlis has passed a law which authorises the Note Reserve Control Committee to bring to Persia part of the gold which has been obtained, or may in future be obtained, as part of the backing for the note issue to exchange it for the silver held in Tehran as backing for the note issue and to sell the silver so released. The object of the law is to withdraw notes from circulation. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 8 . It is reported that the Soviet Embassy has asked the Persian Govern ment for five battalions of gendarmerie to be stationed along the Perso-Thrki^, Iraq frontier for the prevention of the smuggling of grain. The repprt Jffihlikl not be accepted pending confirmation. It is, however, known that the Russians are anxious to prevent grain from leaving Azerbaijan. 9 . Some anxiety is being caused in Government circles by the refusal of the dismissed Governor-General of Azerbaijan, General Muquaddam, to leave the province. For some time accusations have been made against him of being too closely allied with the Russians, and it is now being said that his continued stay in the province is due to a Russian intention to use him to lead a secessionist movement in Azerbaijan. There appear to be no good grounds for these suspicions. Fars. 10. The visit of the Minister for War did not succeed in bringing about a reconciliation between the policy advocated by Qawam ul Mulk and the policy of conciliation being followed by General Jahanbani. The latter policy appears to be consolidating rather than 'undermining Nasir’s influence among the tribes of the south. General Jahanbani justifies it on the grounds that he cannot now risk a fight, that in a few months his troops will be fit to challenge Nasir, and that by that time his diplomacy will have gained Khosrow and some of the Qashgai tribes as adherents to his side. There is little solid ground for this optimism. It is more probable that Nasir’s strength will increase more rapidly than that of the Govern ment forces. The Qawam has come to Tehran to seek a decision whether his policy or Jahanbani’s is to prevail. The Qawam has shown certain weaknesses of character which have raised doubts of his ability to carry through successfully the policy he advocates. If he should attempt and fail the result would probably be widespread disorder in Fars. The alternative, however, seems to be the inevit able consolidation of Nasir’s power and authority over the tribes of Fars. Meanwhile he is endeavouring to show that he can maintain order in the Qashgai tribes, but he continues to harbour and protect some half-dozen Germans and the Deputy Nowbakht. There is no real solution to this troublesome question except the intervention of British troops. Kuh-i-Galu. 11 . Khosrow Zarghampur has been promised a subsidy of 5,000 rials a month in the hope that this will retain his loyalty to Government and his support against his brother Abdullah. Operations are being planned by the Persian army against the Balmai and Taiyyibi tribes, who live south-east of Ram Hormuz. Bakhtiari. 12. Morteza Quli Khan appears to be gradually establishing his authority in Bakhtiari, but small bands of robbers are still active. He has sent his son, Jahanshah Khan, with a body of armed Bakhtiaris, for the purpose of establishing his authority in the Eastern Janeki territory, where the tribesmen had refused to accept the Governor he had appointed. It is reported that he has now received the submission of the local chiefs.if f\$ I I I, , Wz 0 . * THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT ^PERSIA. October 20, 1943.

A vigorous campaign against Seyyid Zia is being organised by Soviet supporters and by vested interests—strange partners. The Russians make no secret of their opposition, and their sentiments are reflected in the Tudeh party press and in the agitation engineered by Qawam-es-Sultaneh, who is now everywhere recognised as being their man. The vested interests are opposed to Seyyid Zia from fear of his alleged reforming zeal. It is too early to estimate the strength of the support rallying to Seyyid Zia. It includes some of the younger intelligentsia and, in spite of ludeh agitation, a number of the lower classes. The Prime Minister sees in the conflict between the two parties a hope of maintaining his position, and in order to embitter the struggle he has ordered the release of three Soviet-supported papers which can be relied upon to attack Seyyid Zia. . • . . 2. The reason for the Russian opposition against Seyyid Zia is not clear, since he has never been associated with an anti-Soviet policy. Indeed, since it was during his short premiership that the Anglo-Persian 1919 Agreement was finally rejected by the Persian Government, he would seem to have some claim to Soviet appreciation. It can only be surmised that the Russians fear that he is j likely to follow a too strongly pro-British policy. 3. The Shah arrived4n Meshed on the 6 th October. According to reports ^ n from His Majesty’s Consul he has been well received. Economic. ^ 4. There has been some improvement in the wheat situation in the capitaL Supplies are now coming in in excess of daily requirements. It has been omcialiy announced that there are now 9,000 tons of grain in reserve m Tehran and a further 6 000 tons in subsidiary warehouses in the vicinity ol lehran. the total collections of wheat for all'Persia are stated to be 72,101 tons and the undertakings 238,807 tons. It is the smallness of the collections m relation to the requirements of 300,000 tons until the next harvest that continues to cause public anxiety Owing to corruption in the Road Transport Department lorries under contract to them which should be collecting wheat are being used tor the transfJbrt of merchants' goods. Dr. Millspaugh. who three months ago assumed responsibility for the nation’s bread supply, was recently severely heckled in a secret session of the Majlis. Few Persians are to be found to-day with faith in Sr MiUspaugh’s powerlither to ensure the collection of the necessary quanti ics of grain or to bring down prices. The upward tendency of food and essential commodity prices continues. The rost-of-l.vmg index for August was 705 compared* with HiO-tu W#* r 'PT. i [46—68] j5. The sale of gold to the public on Persian Government and His Majesty s Government account, besides producing rials for British military expenditure without increasing the note issue or involving the sale of sterling, has had the following effects :— (a) Rials have been obtained more cheaply than by the sale of sterling. (b) Rials have been withdrawn from circulation, so contributing to chec-k finflation. u- n (c) There has been a considerable decrease in the value of real estate, which may later result in a reduction of rents. The sales of gold on His Majesty’s Government account have realised 77,028,371 rials, and on Persian Government account 22,216,092 rials. The average price was £19 85 . 3d. per fine ounce.

Internal Security. Fars. 8 Except for the shoot-up of an Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s tanker on the outskirts of Shiraz, in which the driver and a passenger were killed, no incidents have been reported on the roads in Fars. Most of the, tribes are now well on their way to their winter quarters, and they appear to be Teavmg with moderation. Nasir Qashgai has agreed to co-operate with the Government forces m suppressing banditry. 'He shows no intention of leaving Fars nor of handing over the Germans, who, although they may not actually be m Qashgai territory, are still under Qashgai protection. Khosrow has not yet taken up his appointment as Farmandar of Firuzabad. The Governor-General, Qawam-ul-Mulk. is still m Tehran and it now seems unlikely that he will return to Fars. 1 he policy o conciliation of Nasir and Khosrow Qashgai and of Abdullah Zarghampur, initiated bv General Jahanbani and approved by the Minister for War, who was imnressed by the unfitness for operations of the troops m h ars, has now 80 far that to revert to the policy of disruption which the Qawam was intended to follow would probably precipitate a crisis with which the Qawam could not dea , especially as relations between him and the army have been severely strained by his openly-expressed lack of confidence in its officers. General Jahanbani can point to the establishment of some peace in Fars and may claim with justification that there is hope that it will last for some months, but it is a peace entirely at the mercy of Nasir. He has been summoned to Tehran and told to bring Khosrow with him. Kuh-i-Galu. 9 . General Jahanbani has written with responsibility for keeping order assisting officials in the establishment to Abdullah Zarghampur investing him in the Boir Ahmadi country and for of Government administration. Only3 Persian officials could reconcile this with the subsidy recently promised to Khosrow Zarghampur on condition that he supported Government against his brother Abdullah. Kerman. 10 . Minor operations have been carried out by the troops of the Kerman 4 ^ivision against the notorious robber tribe of Buchakchi living in the Sirj an district, fhey have been for months past pillaging widely under their old chief, Hussain Khan, and a younger rival, Murad Ali Murad. Preliminary operations have been successful in occupying some of their villages and in driving Hussain Khan with some 100 followers into hiding in the hills. Bakhtiari. 11. Although Bakhtiari appears to be settling down under Morteza Quli Khan, there has been an outbreak of sheep stealing and pillaging on the northern limits in the district of Feraidun. The culprits are small tribes of Bakhtiari stock who are not now included in the Bakhtiari Governorship, notably the Zallaki and the Khajeh Mehdi Quli’s tribe. Khorassan. 12 . Soulat-es-Sultaneh, the Hazara chief who rebelled against the Persian Government in January 1942 (see Summary No. 4/42, paragraph 9), has been killed while attempting to escape from a gendarmerie patrol who had been sent to summon him from his village to Meshed. Russian Affairs, 13. In Summary No. 21/43, paragraph 13, it was reported that the Soviet authorities were establishing a hospital in Tehran for Persian patients. This hospital was opened on the 24th May and it is said to have treated 4,000 patients during the first two months of its operation. It is well equipped and well staffed by Russian doctors and is a good advertisement for the efficiency of Russian medical science. The fees are generally high and there are no special facilities for the poorer classes. 14. M. Maisky arrived in Tehran on the 10th October on his return journey from London to Moscow.

I HE campaign against Seyyid Zia increases in vigour. The press and speakers of the Tudeh party openly accuse the British of having arranged his return to Persia and of intending to try to establish him as a dictator bound to British policy. It is more than hinted that his accession to power would ensure Russian hostility to Persia. There is little doubt that this line of propaganda is Russian inspired. In spite of the strictest neutrality on the part of all British officials, Seyyid Zia is regarded as a British candidate for power. His success will be icgarded by Persians as a British victory over the Russians, and his failure as a Russian victory over the British. 2 . Hr. Millspaugh and all his staff have sent in their resignations to the Prime Minister because they have failed to get sufficient support from the Govern ment and the Majlis. Dr. Millspaugh’s chief cause of complaint is the failure of the Majlis to pass the Income Tax Bill (see Summary No. 23 43, paragraphs 10 and 11 ), which he regards as essential to the rehabilitation of the country’s economy. The Government is in a quandary. If Dr. Millspaugh’s mission goes there will be no hope of obtaining financial assistance from America to make good the deficit in the budget, and the Government will be left to shoulder the responsibility, with which they have now saddled the American Mission, for meeting their financial obligations, for reducing the cost of living and for ensuring the country’s bread supply. On the other hand, the members of the present Majlis, with only a few weeks of life to run, will not easilv be persuaded to impose heavy taxation on themselves and their wealthy friends^. While there are many Persians who realise that the departure of the American Mission would be disastrous not only to the economy of Persia and to the reform of the Administration, but also to Perso-American relations, and would give great satisfaction to the Russians, there are few who would not welcome the replace ment of Dr. Millspaugh by someone less rigid and autocratic. It is understood ^ that the only condition on which the mission will withdraw their resignation is M i the passage of the Income Tax Bill in the near future. 3. Hitherto military courts convened to try offences under the Military Governor Law have, with Ihe exception of primary courts trying criminal charges, included officials of the Ministry of Justice both as members of the court and as prosecutor. In future all such courts will be composed of military officers only and the prosecutor will be a military officer. 4. The Law for Compulsory Primary Education which was approved by the Majlis in July provides that compulsory primary education shalf be estab lished throughout the country within ten years, that the course shall He for sixr [47—14] a •aryears, that tuition and books shall be free for all, that children shall be inspected twice yearly by qualified doctors, and that medical treatment shall be free for poor children. 5. The Shah returned to Tehran from Meshed on the 16th October. Economic. * 6 . A committee of prominent Persians has been formed in Tehran for the organisation of anti-typhus measures. The unfinished offices of the Ministry of Finance are being converted into a hospital of 300 beds and the British military authorities have released one of the buildings previously occupied by them as a hospital, which should accommodate another 200-300. Persian Forces. A rmy. 7. In addition to the 200 lorries mentioned in Summary No. 39/43. para graph 3, the Persian army is also acquiring 400 1 0 -ton Fords which were lease- lend supplies for the Russians and have been refused by them. This should give the Persian army ample second-line transport; but they are still almost entirely deficient in light vehicles. Gendarmerie. 8 . In the current year’s budget the pay of the gendarme has been increased to 600 rials a month, from which he is supposed to feed himself. This increase has not brought forward a suitable type of volunteer and the gendarmerie remains at a very 1ow t ebb of efficiency and adds little to security. The current year’s budget has been estimated for a force of 20 , 000 . A ppointments — Military. 9. Sarhang Abbas Garzan, to be Deputy Chief of the General Staff. Internal Security. Ears. 10. General Jahanbani and Khosrow Qashgai have come to Tehran for discussions regarding future policy. There is not likely to be much change in that followed during recent weeks, but His Majesty’s Legation will bring such pressure as is possible to secure the arrest of the Germans now in Pars. There the situation remains much as was described in last week’s Summary. Bakhtiari. 11 . The operations in Janeki (see Summary No. 40/43, paragraph 12) for the establishment there of Morteza Quli Khan’s authority, which are being carried out mainly by Bakhtiari tribesmen with a military column in shadowy support have progressed favourably and appear to be reaching a satisfactory conclusion. Western A zerbaijan. 12. Some anxiety has been caused to the Persian authorities by the incursion into Persia of Sheikh Latif, one of the sons of Sheikh Mahmud of Suleimaniyeh. He is at present in Sardasht preaching Kurdish independence and is reported to be creating some unrest among the tribes. Russian Affairs. 13. Soviet officials have for some time been showing an active interest in political and economic conditions im South-West Persia. Soviet consuls have recently toured through the Lur tribes alid have visited the Beni Turuf and othei Arab tribes in Khuzestan, meeting tribal leaders and collecting information about tribal organisation and sentiments. A branch of the Soviet State Insurance Department has been opened in Khorramshahr and is said to be accepting all kinds of insurance policies. 14. Officials of the Russian Embassy are reported to be showing particular- favour to Sartip Razmara, who recently resigned from the post of Chief of the General Staff and who nurses a grudge against the British on account of the arrest by Indian troops of Persian officers at Isfahan (see Summary No. 36/43,3 paragraph 1 ). He has applied for leave to visit Russia and has informed the . inistr y ^ or War that the Russians have said that they will welcome him if he is given leave. 15. An Irano-Soviet Aid Society has been formed in Tehran under the patronage of Queen Fowzieh for the collection of funds for the relief of distress ■fc, Russia, not as reported in Summary No. 37/43, paragraph 8 , especially for Russian wounded. The committee includes the Minister for War, General Yazdan Panah, some officials and several prominent merchants. It receives much publicity in the press and quite substantial amounts have been subscribed by Persian notables. 16. It has for some time been known that tyres obtained as lease-lend supplies have been sold on the black market in Tehran by official Soviet organisa tions. Reports have recently been received that spare parts for motor vehicles, joi* which there is a very active demand, are also being sold. The purpose is presumably to obtain rials. The black market price for tyres has been up to more than £400 each and has now dropped to £ 200 , due, it is alleged, to Russian sales. 17. An interesting contract between Russian practice and propaganda is reported from Tabriz. There the Russians have a contract with a spinning mill which the owner was practically forced to accept on terms which allowed the barest margin of profit. There has recently been much justifiable discontent among factory workers in Tabriz arising from their low wages and general bad conditions. An official was deputed by the Persian Government to investigate and make recommendations. He recommended certain minimum wages, the reduction of hours of work, the provision of free bread, clothing and medical treatment. The owner of the spinning mill mentioned above stated to His Majesty’s Consul-General that with his contract with the Russians he would lose over 6 million rials a year if he were to implement these recommendations. Shortly afterwards his employees with all factory workers in Tabriz struck for better conditions. The owner explained the position to them and, on his suggestion, they went to the Soviet Consulate-General to appeal for a relaxation of the terms of the contract, as the owner had himself done without success. The employees were not more successful than the owner.IND i— &gt;» v Mh i cjc. /&gt; THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT f - - -f ■ * ^ PERSIA. SECRET.

KM THE threatened resignation of Dr. Millspaugh’s mission was discussed in a secret session of the Majlis, where its consequences were sufficiently well realised to persuade a majority to decide in favour of collaboration with the mission. The Prime Minister was asked to convey to Dr. Millspaugh an assurance to this effect, and also to remind him that it was his duty to collaborate with the Majlis and to take into consideration the views of the Deputies and the amendments suggested by them to measures he proposed. It is understood that it was made plain to the’Deputies that Dr. Millspaugh demanded, as a condition of the withdrawal of his resignation, the passage by the Majlis before the 1st November of three Bills : the Income Tax Bill, the Bill for the engagement of sixty American adyisers for the financial mission and the Bill to sanction a further credit of 400 million rials for the financing of grain purchases. On the 23rd October the President of the Majlis and twenty Deputies were summoned to the Palace, where the Shah impressed on them the necessity for early approval of the proposals of the American mission and other legislation now before them During subsequent sessions of the Majlis the Deputies showed an unusual complaisance and passed the first reading of Bills for the engagement of American advisers for the gendarmerie, the army and the financial mission, and the second reading of the Perso-American Commercial Agreement. 2. Dr. Millspaugh has also made some concessions. He has removed one cause of complaint and opposition by issuing orders that landowneis living in Tehran may import from their villages a year’s supply of wheat for themselves and their families (see paragraph 7 below). It is understood that he has also agreed to the reduction of the 80 per cent, tax he proposed to levy on incomes of over 500,000 rials a year to 70 per cent., and he has appointed a committee qt relatively trusted Persians to report on the supply and distribution of bread in Tehran. Dr. Millspaugh is anxious to divest himself of responsibility for the baking and distribution of bread in Tehran and to hand it over to a l eisian a 8 en cy- rp u( j e k party, with quite clear evidences of Soviet encouragement, staged a demonstration ’in Tehran against Seyyid Zia. Some of the latter’s supporters collected to break up the meeting. The resulting fracas was dispel sed by the intervention of troops. . , 4. Some thirty Deputies, who despair of being re-elected and who have been agitating without success for an extension of the life of the piesent Majlis have united in opposition to the Prime Minister and are working for his overthrow. For the present the Prime Minister, mainly because of the lack of any acceptable rival, can probably count on sufficient support to defeat the Opposition. ’ X47—3o| c/ d. - f'*yjr Economic.

Reports have previously been made in these summaries of the Shah’s ambition to exercise the same control over the army as his father did, of the great reluctance with which he agreed to the subordination of the General Staff to the Ministry for Mar and of his distrust of the ambitions of the present Mmfster for Wa, ! here is lit Je doubt that the appointment to his personal staff of General Yazdan lanah as his principal A.D.C. and of Brigadier-General Razmara as Chiei of his Military Secretariat was made with the object of establishing his own influence o\er the Army m opposition to that of the Minister of War Both these officers are hostile to the Minister for War, are opposed to the grant of authority to the American advisers, and are now at heart unfriendly to the utish. beneial Razmara, as was reported in Summary No. 42/43 paragranh 14 has recently established close relations with the Russians, whose opSn to Ithe Amencan advisers is well known. 1 hey have both within recent monfhs held the post of Chief of the General Staff and have some influence in the Army which is not likely to be used m support of the Minister for War.

As a result of the visit to Tehran of General Jahanbani and Khosrow Qashgai the Government has decided to continue for the present the policy of appeasement which has for the time being produced a measure of peace. They hope that gestures of friendliness on the part of the Government will be more effective in producing dissension among the tribes than the threat of force, which gives the tribes an incentive to combine, and that by the spring the tribes will be sufficiently disunited to justify the Persian Army in undertaking piecemeal dis armament. That is an optimistic view. 15. Khosrow Qashgai has again given solemn assurances to His Majesty’s Legation that he will immediately on his return to Fars take measures for the arrest and surrender to the British authorities of the Germans still in Fars. Much reliance cannot be put on these assurances. 16. The migration of the Khamseh and Qashgai tribes is now well on its way and some have already reached their winter quarters. Western Azerbaijan. 17. It was reported in Summary No. 40/43. paragraph 8 , that the Soviet authorities were pressing for the re-establishment of gendarmerie posts all along the Turco-Persian frontier for the prevention of smuggling. The reply of the Persian Government was that since all the Kurds along this frontier were well armed, it would be impossible to establish gendarmerie posts in Kurdish territory unless the Persian Government were allowed to maintain in the area military forces sufficiently strong to disarm or overawe the Kurds. It has so far been Russian policy to limit to a small and ineffective number the Persian garrisons in Western Azerbaijan and to discourage action by Persian forces against the Kurds. A conference is to be held in Tehran between a Russian general, wdio has come from Azerbaijan, and the Ministers of War and Interior to discuss the matter. In fact, the Persian budget does not allow the increase of gendarmerie or troops that appears necessary.

Tehran, '2nd November. 1943. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 44 for the Period 2§th October to \st November, 1943. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE Government survived an interpellation on the matter of the nation’s bread supplies on the 31st October and obtained a vote of confidence from fiity of the eighty-one Deputies present. 1 he Shah had previously sent a message to certain Deputies, who he believed were working for the overthrow of Soheily and the substitution of Seyyid Zia. in which he made it clear that in no circumstances would he accept Seyyid Zia as Prime Minister and that he expected them to support the present Government., 2. Persians are now convinced that thev see clear evidence of stride between Russian and British policv in Persia. The British support the American advisers; the Russians oppose them. The British have the Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff; the Russians have General Razmara as Chief oi the Shah’s Military Secretariat, Seyyid Zia is pro-British; the. Russians are strongly opposed to Seyyid Zia. The British want the Central Government to I establish its authority; the Russians encourage local autonomy. The Russians have their candidates for the elections; the British have theirs. W 3 . Dr. Millspaugh’s ultimatum to the Persian Government expires on the 2nd November.

The offences are those connected with the wilful damage of communications, installations, factoiles, ports, Ac., of importance to the Imperial Government or its Allies, the spreading of false or subversive news, the theft of arms, ammunition or military stores, subversive activities aoainst the Government or concealing enemy agents. These offences will be tried by military courts. Details will be reported when the Bill becomes law. Economic. 5 The Majlis has approved regulations governing the application of the law which ^ranted a credit of 500 million rials for the assistance of underpaid Government employees (see Summary No. 38/43, paragraph 6 ). The regulations allow financial assistance from the 24th July, 1943, to all employees of the Court and all civilian employees of the Government, the Majlis and municipalities, including members of'the police force, but not of the gendarmerie or army. [47—46] ASJT,2 Cabinet Ministers, Deputies of the Majlis, Governors-General and Governors are also eligible. Extra allowances will be paid on the following scale :— Per cent. On the first 1,000 rials or less of monthly salary ... 80 On salary in excess of 1,000 rials up to 2,000 rials ... 50 On salary in excess of 2,000 rials 25 g The minimum monthly wage will be 1,000 rials for a full day’s work. In addition, Government employees will be entitled to purchase all commodities whose sale is a Government monopoly at favourable prices approved by the Government. 6 . The Government is in considerable difficulties over transport. Theoreti cally, the Road Transport Department controls some 900 trucks supplied to the Persian Government on lease-lend terms and some 1,000 privately-owned trucks on contract. In practice, the drivers of these trucks find it more profitable to carry goods for merchants than for the Persian Government, with the result that they escape for long periods from the control of the Road Transport Department. Immediate transport requirements, among the more urgent of which are the collection of grain for the towns and of the beet harvest for the sugar factories, the anti-locust operations in South-East Persia and the supply of oil for civil needs, cannot be met, and appeal has had to be made to the British military authorities for assistance. Tehran will be faced with a bread crisis within a month unless wheat is transported from Kermanshah and Hamadan. 7. The Majlis has passed a law which makes tradesmen, hotel and restaurant keepers and vendors of provisions convicted of selling their wares at prices above those fixed by Government or municipalities liable to punishment for the first offence of 50-100 lashes, three months’ imprisonment and a fine of 200- 1,000 rials. Several shopkeepers have already suffered corporal punishment. Persian Forces. A rmy. 8 . There is reason to suspect that the Russians are now endeavouring to establish some influence in the Persian army, or at least to prevent the foundation of American and British influence. They regard the Minister for War and the Chief of Staff as pro-British, co-operative with the American advisers, and conse quently anti-Russian. As previously reported, they have been paying some attention to Sartip Razmara, the leader of the Opposition party in the army, and may perhaps hope to be able, through him in his position as chief of the Shah’s | military cabinet, to influence the Shah in his capacity of Commander-in-chief of ‘ the Army. One of the Russian-supported papers has recently published articles addressed to the younger generation of officers heavily criticising their seniors. Some Persian officers are ready to believe that Russian influence will he paramount in Persia after the war and that servility to the Russians may be the best way of achieving their ambitions. 9. Relations between the Minister for War and the Shah are strained. The Shah accuses the Minister for War of trying to be commander-in-chief. The Minister for War greatly resents the Shah’s action in consulting General Razmara before approving papers which he brings up to the Shah . 1 He may resign. Police. 10 . Owing to the difficulty of obtaining recruits for the police force, in spite of their pay having been raised to 1,000 rials a month, the Government have submitted to the Majlis a Bill to make certain classes of persons who had been exempted from military service by the revised Military Service Law of the 20 th March, 1943, liable to conscription for service in the police. These are unmarried men who are the only supporters of certain specified relatives. Air Force. 11 . Colonel Staudach, a Persian officer of Austrian descent, of the Persian air force, has left for Mid-East, where he is to be given opportunities to gain experience to qualify him to command the Persian air force.

The Persians awitended that gendai*merie posts could not be maintained among the armed ^P^urdish tribes without strong military backing. The Russians were unwilling o agree that the Persian army should be given liberty of action to operate against the Kurds with such forces as it considered necessary, but eventually agreed verbally that twelve companies of infantry might be posted in support of gendarmerie frontier posts on condition that any operations they carried out were under gendarmerie and not under army control. The gendarmerie on the frontier is to consist ol six battalions. The Russians also agreed verbally that a brigade nf f ersian troops should be stationed at Mahabad, that south of a line from Ushniyeh to Mahabad the Persians could dispose their troops and carry out any operations they liked without reference to the Russians, but that north of that line the Russians must be kept informed of any redistribution of the four brigades at Tabriz, Ardebil, Rezaieh, Mahabad—to which they have agreed, and of any troop movements. The decisions arrived at are to be put into writing, and. until they are signed by the Russians, they should not be accepted as definite. Bakhtiari. 14. The operations carried out by Bakhtiari tribesmen in Eastern Janeki territory for the establishment of the authority of Morteza Quli Khan, Governor of Bakhtiari, which were referred to in Summary No. 42/43, paragraph 11 , have been successfully concluded and Morteza Quli Khan’s nominee has been installed as Governor. Kuhigalu. 15. Plans have now been made for operations for the disarmament of the Bahmai and Taiyyibi tribes to begin on the 7th December. Columns are to operate southwards from the Isfahan Division and northwards from Ram Hormuz. It is considered unlikely that the Boir Ahmadi will come to the assistance of the Bahmai and Taiyyibi, as they are occupied with inter-clan dissensions. Ears. 16. Only a few cases of minor looting have been reported during the past week.

IN order to avert the cessation of work by Dr. Millspaugh and his mission, which was due to take effect on the 3rd November, the Majlis agreed to shorten the normal procedure necessary for the consideration of the Income lax Bill by allowing the Government to withdraw the original Bill and to substitute as a new Bill with double urgency the amended draft approved by the Government, the Majlis Commission and Dr. Millspaugh. This Bill is now before the Majlis, but, in spite of its double urgency,.it makes slow progress. Dr. Millspaugh has post poned putting his resignation into effect for the time being. 2. Persians find comfort in the assurance given in the communique issued after the Moscow Conference that the three Powers would not employ their armed forces in other States after the war except for the purposes specified in the communique. They are also impressed by the apparent e\ idence of Allied solidarity. Economic. 3. Speaking in the Majlis on the 31st October, the Prime Minister gave the following figures about the grain situation :— Landlords’ undertakings to deliver Deliveries to the 28th October Stocks in the Tehran stores on the 26th October- Flour Wheat Barley Millet Tons. 265,581 113.446 3,201 534 4,578 10,719 i y In Khorassan collections of grain have fallen short of forecasts and it is now ! estimated that the province may have a deficit of 2.500 tons instead of a surplus I of 10 , 000 . 4.

In Summary No. 44 / 43 , paragraph 9 , it was reported that relations were strained between the Shah and the Minister for War, who was threatening to resign. The Shah, possibly because he realised that the British Legation would not at present welcome the resignation of the Minister, has yielded on the main point at issue, which was whether papers presented by the Minister to the Shah should be subject to scrutiny by the Chief of the Shah’s Military Secretariat, General Razmara, before return to the Minister. The Shah has agreed not to insist on this and that regulations should be drafted by the Ministry for M ar to define the duties and responsibilities of his Military Secretariat. These will probably be on the Belgian model. It seems that the Shah has decided that for the time being he will not force the issue between himself and the Ministry of War for control of the army.

The Minister for War, who a short time ago was reproached by the Soviet Charge d’Affaires with being unfriendly to Russian interests and hostile to Persians who co-operated with the Soviet, states that in a recent interview he found M. Maximov in much more friendly mood. The latter went so far as to say that he had done the Minister an injustice in accusing him of unfriendliness, and he promised to intervene with the Soviet military authorities for the return to the Persian army of some of the barracks occupied by Soviet troops in Meshed.

I he Prime Minister’s position grows weaker and there are many who prophesy that he cannot last much longer. He has lost the sympathy of the capitalists for allowing Dr. Millspaugh’s Income Tax Bill to become law, of those ex-Deputies who have not been re-elected for allowing the new elections to be held and of the general public for failure to set Persia’s house in order. There are rumours of Cabinet changes. 2 . Seiyid Zia-ud-din, after forty days in Persia, states that he has made headway and gained many new adherents. To the neutral observer, however, the Russian refusal to have anything to do with him, his incompetent associates (with the exception of Zarin Kafsh and Ibtehaj) and his failure to produce a practical programme of reform, belie his statement. 3. Dr. Millspaugh’s Income Tax Bill was passed by the Majlis on the 12th November and his mission have, therefore, withdrawn their resignations i Dr. Millspaugh pays tribute to the well-timed intervention of His Imperial Majesty The Shah, who interviewed certain Majlis Deputies and warned them of ^ the evil consequences for Persia of further delay.

The British army has come to the rescue of the Persian Road Transport Board and is to move 10,000 tons of grain during December and January from Kermanshah to Hamadan, Sultanabad (Arak) and Tehran. Persian Forces. 5. Reference paragraph 6 of Summary No. 45/43, General Ridley, the American adviser to the Persian Ministry of War, has submitted a memorandum to the Shah pointing out that there is no necessity for a military secretariat on the Belgian or any other model and that the functions of the Shah’s military secretary should be limited to ceremonial. Kurdistan. Internal Security. 6 . In Sennah the situation is generally quiet. In Southern Kurdistan it is expected that the situation will improve owing to the detention under sur veillance in Kermanshah of two prominent Quran chieftains who are believed to have had dealings with Naubakht, the pro-Axis politician. f [48—21] AJ.

Two regiments of infantry are to move to Arak by road and thence by r rail to Ahwaz where they will be joined by a third regiment and form the southern column, which is to move northward to disarm first the Bahmai and then the Taiyyibi. It is not thought that the Boir Ahmedi will come to the assistance of either of these two tribes but a regiment of infantry is to remain at Behbehan to deal with any uprising on their part.

The life of the present Majlis ends on the 23rd November. The presence of sixty-nine members is necessary before the new Majlis can open. About sixty have already been elected, but it is not unlikely that the opening will be postponed for some weeks on one pretext or another. It is understood that the Shah wishes in the interim to dismiss the present Prime Minister and to put in a Cabinet of his own choosing. As far as is known, he has not yet selected the new Prime Minister. 2. Relations are still strained between the Shah and the Minister for War and the latter suspects that the Shah is endeavouring to force him to resign or to find excuses for omitting him from the next Cabinet. 3. During the last fortnight of its life the Majlis passed the following Bills :—■ The Budget Bill. The Income Tax Bill—see Summary No. 23/43, paragraph 10. The Bill for the engagement of sixty American advisers for the Millspaugh Mission. The Bill authorising the Government to borrow 400 million rials for the purchase of drugs.

The Bill making military personnel liable to the jurisdiction of civil courts for all except purely military offences. 4 . Voting for the election of new Deputies for Tehran is about to begin. It is expected that the elections will not be completed for two or three weeks. 5 . A letter from the President of the Iraqi Parliament addressed to the Persian Parliament protesting against the action of the French authorities in the Lebanon was read out in open session. 6 . The Shah has given £500 to Earl Haig’s Fund. Economic. 7. The 1943-44 Budget Law was passed by the Majlis on the 16th November. As presented, the budget was divided into two parts : “ (a) the ordinary budget, showing revenue at approximately 1,891 million rials, and expenditure at 3,298 million rials, or a deficit of about 1,400 million rials, and (b) the “ Extra ordinary ” budget (dealing with the trading and industrial enterprises of the [48—28] Sp/r? Z/ys.Government) showing revenue at about 5,796 million rials, and expenditure at about 5,897 million rials, or approximately self-balancing. Dr. Millspaugh had already indicated in one of his recent Monthly Reports the probability of a large budget deficit, which, he recommended, should be met by a foreign loan. The Majlis, however, are opposed to Persia asking for foreign financial help, and accordingly proceeded to balance the budget by bringing in as an item of revenue the value (approximately 1,500 million rials) of the stocks ot commodities held by the various Government trading agencies at the beginning 1 of the current financial year. 8 . Dr. Millspaugh has made further concessions to the householder in the matter of obtaining flour in addition to that reported in Summary No. 43/43, paragraph 2 . He has now issued a regulation which permits heads of families to purchase, but only from proprietors who have fulfilled their undertakings or from peasants, wheat foi* consumption by their families at the approved scale of 180 kilog. for each member. Licences to purchase will be issued by the Cereals and Bread Department, and the wheat purchased must pass through one of the warehouses of the department from which delivery may be taken on production of ration cards. 9. The Majlis has passed the Bill authorising the Government to borrow from the National Bank the amount of 400 million rials to finance the purchase of grain until the end of the current financial year—see Summary No. 43/43. para graph 5—also a Bill granting a credit of 20 million rials to the Pharmaceutical Institute for the purchase of drugs. 10. The Majlis has passed a Bill sanctioning the engagement of two American experts for service with the Ministry of Hygiene. One is to be director- general of the Service of Hygiene and the other director of the Pharmaceutical Institute. 11 . On the 16th November the Shah opened the Machine Gun factory, or rather that part of it which has been completed, to manufacture machine pistols for delivery to the Soviet authorities in accordance with the contract they made with the Persian Government—see Summaries No. 45/42, paragraph 11, and 49/42, paragraph 15. The contract was for the manufacture and supply by the Persian Government of 60,000 rifles, 42 million rounds of ammunition and 30,000 machine pistols. As regards machine pistols, the contract stipulated that 4,000 should be delivered in August 1943 and the remainder at intervals before December 1943. The delay in completing the factory is due to the failure of the Russians to provide certain machinery in time. At the official opening it was stated that the capacity of the factory was now 60,000 machine pistols a year and was capable of being increased to 100,000. It was expected that 30,000 would be completed by the 20th March, 1944. The Soviet authorities have not yet made any agreement regarding payment for these arms. Persian Forces. 12. The Shah is incensed by the opposition in the Ministry for War and the General Staff to his military secretariat, and General Ridley's plain expression of opinion that such an institution was unnecessary and injurious has not disposed him more kindly to the American advisers. He vented his anger on General Riazi, the Chief of Staff, when the latter supported General Ridley’s views, by accusing him of being an informant of the British Legation and disloyal to himself. 13. Twelve officers of the Persian Air Force left Tehran on the 21st November for training in England by the Royal Air Force. A p'pointments — Military. 14. —(i) Sarhang Mahmud Sartipi to be second in command of the 2nd Division. (ii) Sarhang Muqbeli to be Chief of Staff of the Forces of the South.

(v) Sarhang Himmat to command the 17th (Jahrum) Brigade (Fars Division). (vi) Sarhang Mustashiri to command the gendarmerie of the Khuzistan and Lurestan Gendarmerie District. Internal Security. 15. Tribal migrations this year have been accompanied by very little dis- i turbance, and generally throughout the country there is an unusual degree ofc .’ a 0l1 ^^ much robbery. Phis is, no doubt, partly due to the fact that the ersian government is being careful to avoid stirring up strife or interfering a gg res sive y in tribal affairs. Kurds, Qashgai, Bakhtiari have all now achieved a very air measure of autonomyBut peace rests on a very insecure basis. It is no m the nature of Persian tribesmen, plentifully. supplied with arms and ammunition, to be good for long. In Khuzistan the Arabs cannot refrain from ^bbing friend and foe and they will probably continue to do so until their arms Ptie taken from them. In Ears, although there is no serious tribal disturbance while ISasn Qashgai tries to consolidate his position and extend his influence over doubtful, neutral and hostile tribes, there is much robbery. During a tour made by the (icneral Officer Commanding the Southern Forces a few minor brigands surrendered, but many notorious robbers are still active. Russian Affairs. 16. Vishinsky, Vice-Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R.. has arrived in Tehran on his way to Algiers. Turkish Affairs. 17. In Summary No. 35/43, paragraph 21, it was reported that the Turkish Government had offered 100 scholarships at Turkish colleges to Persian students. Twenty-five of the selected students have recently left Persia for Turkey.

Persians feel honoured that Tehran should have been selected for the meeting of Mr. Churchill, Mr. Roosevelt and Premier Stalin and have appropriated to themselves some glory from the presence in their capital of so many distinguished men. The Shah and the Government are greatly pleased that the representatives of the three Powers signed a declaration affirming their desire for the maintenance of the territorial integrity and independence of Persia. The Shah has declared himself to be highly delighted with the sentiments expressed by Stalin in a private audience, which had relieved him of anxiety regarding Russian intentions towards Persia and more particularly towards himself. He now felt confident of Stalin’s personal goodwill and support. (See also paragraph 8 below.) 2 . The closing down of all communications from and to Tehran during the conference created some anxiety in the provinces as to what was happening in the capital. The commonest supposition was that a revolutionary couf d'Etat had taken place and that a new dictator would be found to be installed in power. 3. The 13th Majlis held its last session on the 23rd November. Over seventy of the new Deputies have been elected and that number is sufficient for i the opening of the new Majlis. The Shah, however, is in no hurry to see the new Majlis in operation as he hopes to have a Government of his own choosing in office before it opens. He has not yet been able to find a Prime Minister to his liking, and Soheily may continue. He tried, but failed, to persuade Hussein Ala (F.O. 7, M.A. 11), his Minister of Court, to accept the charge. He appears to be determined to get rid of Sipahbud Ahmadi from the Ministry of War, and in this determination he will find encouragement from the Russians, who regard General Ahmadi as being too pro-British. The Shah recently warned the Chief of Staff against being too openly co-operative with the British. That, he said, was not in the interests of Persia as it aroused Russian hostility and suspicion. Economic. 4. A syndicate of Persian merchants has been formed for the purchase of 60,000 tons of rice in the Caspian provinces. Of this amount 36,000 tons will be sold to the Soviet authorities, who will pay in goods—sugar, piece-goods and glassware. The balance of 24,000 tons will be sold to the Persian Government. The rice crop in the Caspian provinces is estimated this year to be 250,000 tons. 5 . The Majlis passed a law authorising the Government to mint and put into circulation silver coins of the denominations of 1 , 2, 5 and 10 rials. The coins are to be 60 per cent, silver and 40 per cent, copper. at2 6 .

The Shah has told the Minister for War and the Chief of Staff separately that Stalin during a private audience had promised the Shah Russian support in forming a large and strong Army in Persia. As evidence of goodwill Stalin was presenting twenty aircraft and twenty tanks to the Shah and would send instruc tors to train Persian crews. He proposed that the Russians should establish a flying school at Kazvin or some other place in North Persia for the training of Persian pilots. This will be claimed as a justification for their attitude by General Razmara and other officers who have recently been seeking Russian support against the allegedly pro-Rritish Minister for War and Chief of Staff who have drawn no tanks or aircraft from the Rritish. A ffointments — Military. 9. —(i) Sarlashkar Hadi Shaqaqi (F.O. 196, M.A. 270) to be Director of the Military Tribunals Department of the War Office.

There are indications that General Jahanbani is losing faith in the professions of goodwill of Nasir and Khosrow Qashgai. The Germans have not yet been handed over; Nasir is demanding that five of the Deputies of Fars should be his nominees and has threatened that he will not be able to prevent some Qashgais from going to the help of the Dashtis and Tangistanis, against whom Persian troops are now carrying out disarmament operations, unless the opera tions are stopped. General Jahanbani is now making some attempt to assure non-Qashgai tribes that Nasir is not the power in Fars that he claims to be. Abdullah Zarghampur of the Boir Ahmadi has reproached Nasir with deserting him and has informed him that he now considers himself free to act in his own | interests alone. Kuk-i-Galu. 11 . The plans for the disarmament of the Taiyyibi, Bahmai and Western Janeki tribes, which were referred to in Summary No. 44-43, paragraph 15, havebeen considerably modified and the projected operation may in the end be abandoned The change is due to the Minister for War’s lack of confidence in bartip gadar, whose troops were to have taken part in the operations. The latter is involved in an elaborate intrigue to discredit the Minister for War of which the movmg spirit is General Razmara, to whose party Sartip Qadar belongs, ine fehah has refused to approve the Minister for War’s proposal to relieve feartip (qjadar or his command. The Shah also would willingly see the Minister for War discredited. Russian Affairs. 12 .

Tehran, '20th December 1943. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 49, for the period 0th to \0th December, 1943. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. 1 . Under strong pressure from the Shah, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet resigned on the 14th December. Soheily was immediately asked to form a new Cabinet and was obliged to include in it certain Ministers of the Shah’s own choice and to exclude the only two strong men of the previous Cabinet—the Ministers for the Interior and for War. The elimination of these two was indeed the Shah’s main object in insisting on a reorganisation of the Cabinet. His increasing hostility to General Ahmadi has been mentioned in these summaries and the latter’s dismissal and replacement by Ibrahim Zand have been interpreted in some quarters as an indication of the Shah’s desire to please the Russians at the expense of the British, for General Ahmadi was generally believed to be pro-British and anti-Russian while Ibrahim Zand, having been educated in Russia, is credited with being pro-Russian. 2. The new Cabinet is as follows :— Prime Minister : AH Soheily.(') Justice : Muhsin Sadr.(') Foreign Affairs : Muhammad Saed.(') Finance : Amanullah Ardalan.(') Interior : Abdul Hussein Hajir.C) Roads and Communications : Nasridlah Intizam.(') Agriculture : Nuri Isfapdiari (Muvaffiq es Sultaneh) (F.O. 99). Education: Issa Saddiq (F.O. 178, M.A. 247). Posts and Telegraphs : Hamid Sayyah (F.O. 187, M.A. 258). War : Ibrahim Zand. Public Health : Dr. Ghani. Commerce and Industry : Sartip Shefahi (F.O. 190, M.A. 261). Without Portfolio : Mustafa Adi (F.O. 1, M.A. 1). The only portfolios that remain in the same hands as in the previous Cabinet are those of Justice and Foreign Affairs. Of the new Ministers Saddiq, Sayyah and Adi have held office in previous Cabinets. Zand and Shafai have both recently been members of the Shah’s personal staff, as was Intizam until he became a Cabinet Minister in February 1943. Nuri Isfandiari is also a Shah’s nominee. It is generally thought that this is the Shah’s first step in the experiment of o-overning the country through a subservient Cabinet as his father did. The Cabinet resembles those approved by his father, in that it contains no man of strong character. It is, however, composed of men who, with the exception of the Prime Minister, have a relatively good reputation for honesty. In order to gain popular support much is likely to be made of professions of the Government’s desire to improve the condition of the lower classes, for the mood P) Members of previous Cabinet. 3 /f 1r * V \c of the new Majlis is likely to he critical and suspicious of the Shah s intentions. It is unlikely to have the docility of the Majlises selected by Reza Shah; nor has his youthful son his strength of character or singleness of purpose. It is rumoured that the Shah intends to postpone the opening of the new Majlis for as long as possible. 3. The Shah, the press and the politically-minded public continue to find cause for rejoicing in the results of the Tehran Conference, and particularly ii the three-Power declaration concerning Persia. The latter has certainly greath relieved public anxiety regarding the position of Persia vis-a-vis Russia after the war. The declaration does not in fact say anything that had not previously been said by Great Britain and Russia, and it is presumably the association of the United States with the assurances that has given such confidence to Persians. It is to be hoped that the result will lie that they will now concern themselves less with speculations about the possible intentions of their neighbours and will devote themselves to putting their very untidy house in order. 4. Both the Shah and the Prime Minister have gained in public esteem, the latter's hitherto unsuspected statesmanship being given some credit for Persia having acquired the proud position of being the only country to have been given a public individual assurance of her post-war position by the three Powers. 5. To commemorate the conference the Tehran Municipality has decided that three streets in Tehran shall be named Roosevelt, Stalin and Winston Churchill. 6 . Owing to complaints of irregularities and interference by Government officials, which led to the dismissal of Bahraini, the chief of the Tehran Municipality, voting in the Tehran elections was suspended for some days. It has now been resumed. Economic. 7. In an interview with the press, Crawford, the American Director of the Cereals and Bread Department, gave the following figures :— t A t 15th Decem ber, A t 15th December, 1943. 1942. Tons. T ons.

Other grains, 2,300 tons. Daily consumption of Tehran, 250 tons. Persian Forces. A rmy. 8 . The Shah is reported by more than one reliable informant to have said that, having got rid of General Ahmadi from the Ministry for War and substituted for him a presumably tractable civilian of his own choice, he now intends to be Commander-in-chief of the Army in fact as well as in name and to limit the role of the Ministry for War to that of supplying the needs of the army. He has even been considering the cancellation of the decree whereby the subordination of the General Staff to the Ministry was made clear. He is still exalted by the belief that in this he will be supported by the Russians. His dismissal of General Ahmadi is being represented as a gesture to please the Russians, and the army is now expecting that the Shah will go a step further in this policy by substituting General Razmara for General Riazi as Chief of Staff (see also Summary No. 44, 1943, paragraph 8 ). 9. The Government has now issued regulations defining the duties and powers of the American military advisers to the Ministry for War. Their duties are to advise on all matters connected with the administration of the army and to prepare plans for administrative reform. Their responsibilities extend to those departments of the Ministry dealing with office work, finance, transport, supply, engineer, medical and veterinary services, recruiting, military justice and horse breeding. Of the eleven officers now available, seven are allotted to headquartersr 3 and tour to provincial divisions, one to two divisions. The members of the American mission are responsible for supervising and assisting in the execution of the regulations governing administration issued by the Ministry for War on the advice of the head of the mission. They will be directly under the orders of the head of the mission, and will not exercise command of any unit of the Persian army unless authorised to do so by the Minister for War. The head of the ^ 4i ission ^ as to demand that the Ministry for War shall make formal ^wiquiry into any matter connected with administration which he may lay before him, and that he shall be provided with the information resulting from that enquiry. I he head of the mission is authorised to make recommendations to the Ministry for War regarding the promotion, reduction, transfer or dismissal of officers employed in administrative services. I he regulations are vaguely framed and do not appear to give to the American advisers that definite authority, particularly over officers, which is necessary if their measures of reform are to be effective. A appointments — Military. 10. Army. (i) Sarhang Alp to be Commander of the Recruit Training Depot of the 6 th (Ears) Division. Gendarmerie.

(iv) Sarhang Hussein Farzaneh to be Chief of Staff at Gendarmerie Headquarters. (v) Colonel Schwarzkopf (United States army) to be Director of » Organisation of the Gendarmerie. Russian Affairs. 11 . It is reliably reported that Russian and Turkish generals met in conference on the 20th November at Bazirgan on the Perso-Turkish frontier. It is surmised that a subject discussed was raiding by Persian Kurds into Turkey of which there have in recent times been Turkish complaints. A fghan A ffairs. 12.

Political. 1 . 1 he appointment of the new Cabinet has been on the whole received with apathy in the country, and the general expectation seems to be that it will not last long after the opening of the new Parliament. That has been announced for the 22nd January. The results of the Tehran elections should soon be available as voting has closed. In Azerbaijan voting has been suspended owing to the strong interference of the Soviet authorities on behalf of candidates of the Tudeh party. 2. Dr. Penes arrived in Tehran from Moscow on the 28th December for a short visit, during which he was the guest of the Shah. Both the Shah and the Government laid themselves out to demonstrate how admirably they could entertain^ an important State guest. The University of Tehran conferred on Dr. Penes the degree of Doctor honoris causa. 3. There is some unrest among manual workers in Tehran. There were threatened strikes of railway workers and of employees in the wireless station of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs and an actual strike in the ammunition factory at Sultanabad near Tehran. In all cases the cause of the discontent was alleged to be insufficiency of pay. Conditions of the working classes are generally sufficiently bad to make easy the work of the agitator. That agitators are at work there is no doubt, nor that the long-suffering Persian working classes are being awakened to a knowledge of their power. The Minister of Finance and Dr. Millspaugh have issued a communique informing the workers that a commission has been formed to investigate and report on the pay of manual workers in Government employ. 4. There is no longer any doubt that the Tudeh party is directly supported by the Soviet authorities. The mere fact that it had achieved the distinction, unique in Persia, of having existed for over a year as an organised and disciplined party with a consistent programme was sufficient to arouse suspicions that it was being held together and directed by outside influence, and during the elections Russian support of Tudeh candidates has been unconcealed. 5. The statement alleged to have been made by Mr. Roosevelt on his return to the United States to the effect that Marshal Stalin had informed him that there were 100 German agents in Tehran during the conference and that a plot to murder the three statesmen had been discovered, called forth a denial in the2 press from the Persian Government. They stated that nothing had been said to the Persian authorities by any representative of the three Allies of the existence of any such plot either before or during the conference, and that high officials of all three Allies had thanked the Persian Government for their efficient security measures. Appointments — Civil. JBfe 6 . —(i) Ma’sud Muazid to be Persian representative at Beirut with the rank of Minister. (ii) Abdullah Ashrafi to be Farmandar of Shahreza.

The recruit training and administrative depots, which are part of the reorganisation plan of the American advisers (see Summary No. 42/49/43. para graph 9 ), have now been inaugurated at all divisional headquarters outside the Russian zone. An American officer has been allotted to every two divisions one to the 1st and 2nd, one to the 4th and 5th, one to the 6 th and 10th, and one to the 7th and 9th Divisions. 9 . General Ridley states that he has recently found the Shah more sympathetic to the work of the American Mission, and even insisting that more officers should be obtained from America. An urgent request for at least nine more—making with the eleven already here twenty in all—has been made to Washington by the Persian Government. 10 . The transport situation of the Persian army has considerably improved with the arrival of some 600 trucks from America. These have been organised into units under the supervision of one of the American advisers. Although the standard of driving and maintenance is low and the misuse of transport is rampant. General Ridley is not dissatisfied with the progress made in the circumstances that existed. A ppointments — Military. 11 . Army. —Sartip Rohulla Keikavusi to be Military Governor of Tehran.

The situation remains outwardly calm, largely because the Persian authorities are careful to do nothing that might irritate Nasir and Khosrow Qashgai. Persian Government arms in the possession of the Qashgai tribes have not yet been handed back; nor has Khosrow Qashgai implemented his promise to apprehend and surrender the Germans, five of whom are known to be just outside the borders of Qashgai territory. The Mamassand tribes, who have hitherto refused to ally themselves with Nasir and who might have formed a loyal pro-Government bloc in the middle of Qashgai territory, are reported to have been alienated by the Government’s rejection of their claim to the ownership of certain lands. As far as can be judged the position of the Government grows weaker and that of the tribes grows stronger. Khuzistan. 13. A band of brigands, variously reported to be Boir Ahmadi or Taiyyibi, has been operating in the vicinity of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s field at Pazanun. Company property and employees have not yet suffered, but travellers have been looted and several gendarmes have been killed.3 Russian Affairs. 14. The Shah has presented a medal to the Russian Colonel, Bourseiv, as a token of appreciation of the assistance he gave in the work of completing the machine-gun factory for the manufacture of machine pistols. 15. Two Russian officers have arrived in Ears for the alleged purpose of investigating agricultural possibilities. Appendix to Summary No. 1 . (Reference : Paragraph 7.) Personality Note: Zand, Ibrahim {Ebrahim), Minister for War. Born about 1890. Educated at the Cadet College at St. Petersburg. Then sent to study law in France, where he was a contemporary and friend of Jaw ad Amery. Towards the end of the last war became an active member of the Musawat party in Azerbaijan, and in 1919 became a member of the short-lived Azerbaijan Government. After its fall he went back to France, and a few years after returned to Persia, where Davar employed him in the Ministry of Justice as an advisor. He was subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and in 1938 became a member of the board of the National Bank. On the appoint ment of A. H. Ebtehaj as director of that bank he left the bank and was employed at Court as Comptroller of the Royal Accounts. Minister of War in Soheily’s third Cabinet, December 1943. Married to the sister of Farajullah Bahramy. Speaks Russian extremely well, probably better than Persian. A harmless but weak man, who has not succeeded in making his mark in either politics, law or banking, and has obtained the post of Minister of War in order that he should enable others to run that Ministry.INDEXED ri ... 29 FEB 1944 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. : r C .; •? 3 I January 27, 1944. i £ SECRET.

THE Majlis is due to be opened on the 22nd January; invitations for the opening ceremony have been issued, and it seems probable that by that date there will be present in Tehran more than the sixty-nine Deputies necessary to form a quorum. The total number of Deputies elected to date is seventy-five. About one-third of the votes cast in the Tehran elections have been counted, and a list of the leading candidates is published daily in the press. These for some days included the names of Saiyyid Abul Qasim Kashani and Matin Daftari, against whom charges are pending of having abetted German plots in Persia. The impropriety of advertising to the world the extent of the esteem in which these notorious Germanophils are held by the voters of Tehran and the bad impression that would thereby be made on Persia’s allies was reluctantly recognised by the Government, and their names no longer appear in the lists of favourites. 2. Suleiman Muhsin Iskandari (Suleiman Mirza), leader of the Tudeh party, and for some years a professing Communist, has died. His funeral was attended by representatives of the Soviet Embassy. Economic. 3 . In his monthly report for the month the 24th October- 22 nd November Dr. Millspaugh discusses the principles that should guide the framing of the budget for the coming year, and particularly the conflicting demands of agricul tural development, public education, public health and security. He makes some pertinent remarks about the army and gendarmerie which will^ meet with no approval from the Shah. The army, ne says, has no task except that of internal policing; he encourages the Government and the Deputies to resist demands for an increased budget allotment for the army and urges them to consider the possibility of reducing its size in order to make funds available for its better equipment and its greater contentment. The Shah, as is well known, is demanding an increased budget for a larger army, whose task, he likes to think, is to maintain the independence of Persia and add to his own importance. xLe army is likely to be a first-class issue in the new Majlis, both as regards the share it consumes of the national revenue with very little benefit to the nation, and as regards the Shah’s pretensions to make it the instrument of his personal policy. 4 Probably as a result of the influence of American advisers m various administrations,' investigations are being made into large-scale embezzlements and frauds. Officials of the Road Transport Department, of the Cereals and Bread Department and other departments of the Ministry of Finance, and army [50—3] . . — , * * 1a officers have been in some cases dismissed and in others arrested for corrupt practices. Even a few convictions will have a good effect. 5. Unrest among workers continues to show itself. In Isfahan telephone operators went on strike for some days for higher wages. In accordance with the promise made to workers in Government employ after the disturbances reported in Summary No. 1/44, paragraph 3, an interdepartmental commission was appointed to fix minimum wages for unskilled workers. It recommended for th(* approval of the Council of Ministers that unmarried men should draw 9 ria#^ a day, married men without families 12 , and with families 15 rials. 6 . Throughout the rural districts the people suffer from a shortage of tea, sugar and cloth. The Chief Administrator of the Price Stabilisation Section has recently published the fact that there are in Government stores 28 million yards of cloth and ample stocks of sugar. It is solely due to corruption and to the inefficiency of distribution that supplies do not reach the people who so badly need them. A ppointments — Civil. 7. —^(i) Ghulam Hussein Ashrafi, formerly Director-General in the Ministry of Industry and Mines, to be Under-Secretary of State in the office of the President of the Council of Ministers.

It seems possible that the new Minister for War will not be content to be the cypher he was intended to be by the Shah. He has already made formal protest against the conduct of General Razmara, the Chief of the Shah’s Military Secretariat, who in one case passed the Shah's orders to him in discourteous terms, and in another issued orders for the dismissal and replacement of the Military Governor of Tehran without reference to the Minister or the Govern ment. He has invited the American advisers generally to take a more active part in the reform and supervision of administration, has authorised General Ridley to appoint an American officer to take executive charge of the administration of the Isfahan Division, where the divisional commander was being obstructive, and has demanded from the American advisers within ten days a scheme for the reorganisation of the Finance Branch of the War Office, to include a 50 per cent, reduction in its staff. 9. Increases of pay have been sanctioned for military officers and civilian officials of the Ministry for War on the scale already approved for other Govern ment servants (see Summary No. 44/43, paragraph 5). According to the Minister for War, these increases are “ sufficient to enable officers to live on their pay.” He now intends to insist that corruption shall no longer be condoned and that all officers guilty of dishonesty shall be brought to trial. has srn&lt;e been C\ owevnor - Qf.'nzto-t Internal Security. North Khorassan. 10 . Quarrels have again broken out between the leaders of the Zaafaranlu and Bicharanlu Kurds in the neighbourhood of Shirvan, but no reports have yet been received of inter-tribal fighting. Hold-ups of U.K.C.C. lorries have occurred between Quchan and the Russian frontier, which may be connected with these tribal disturbances. Pars. 11. General Jahanbani has been expressing some anxiety regarding the possibility of disturbances arising from the hostility existing between Abdullah r /c,r» n i sZarghampur on tfie one hand and his brother Khosrow and Muzaffar Am, another 01 t Ahmadi chief, on the other. He has asked for reinforcements to be sent to e e an o guard against possible threats to the area of the oil-fields, and it is probable that three battalions will be sent from Tehran. Khosrow Qashgai is now with Abdullah Zarghampur in Western Kuh-i-Galu, ostensibly to discuss ■LA® l i rr 1 en( lf 1 Germans who are now in Boir Ahmadi territory. It is ^ubtiul whether this is more than a pretence, and it is probable that the real purpose of his visit is rather to re-establish the alliance between Abdullah Zarghampur and himself and his brother Nasir. 12 . General Jahanbani is also proposing to move a force through Mamass&amp;nni country to Basht for the purpose, he pretends, of exercising a restraining influence on Abdullah Zarghampur. It seems, however, that his real object may be to coerce the Mamassinni, who are refusing to accept a recent decision of the Government on claims to tribal lands made by the Mamassinni chiefs. The Government may yet realise that they cannot afford to antagonise the Mamassinni and may forbid a move that might lead to hostilities. Khuzestan. 13. Some of the Bahmai and Jancki chiefs, against whom it was intended to carry out operations (see Summary No. 48/43, paragraph 11 ), have visited the Persian commander in Khuzestan to make submission. They have promised to surrender some arms, and the Persian commander hopes that the show of force which he will be able to make if he receives the reinforcements referred to in paragraph 11 above will be sufficient to induce the fulfilment of this promise. Russian Affairs. 14. M. Mikailov, the new Soviet xAmbassador in Persia, arrived in Tehran on the 11 th January. 15. M. Kozlov, Soviet Consul-General in Meshed, has been appointed a member of the Inter-Allied European Commission. 16. The Russian officers who, as reported in Summary No. 1/44, para graph 15, had arrived in Ears for the alleged purpose of investigating agricultural possibilities, were in the neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas on the 7th January. The Ministry of Agriculture denies knowledge of these officers, and the real purpose of their journey is unknown. 17. An Irano-Soviet Cultural Society has been formed in Tehran as a counterblast to the British Council. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs figure on the committee, which includes several prominent Persians. Telegrams of mutual felicitation have been exchanged with the Soviet Society for Foreign Cultural Relations (VOKS). 18. For some months a strong drive has been in progress throughout Persia for the collection of funds for Soviet sufferers from the war. The methods used under the spur of Soviet representatives have savoured of blackmail. They have resulted in the collection of quite substantial sums and in bringing Russia prominently to the notice of many Persians. Iraqi Affairs. 19. Khadim-al-Dujaili has arrived in Tabriz as Iraqi Consul. He was formerly lecturer in Arabic at the London School of Oriental Studies. A byssinian A ffairs. 20. Dr. Tourenzo has arrived in Tehran to take up his post as Abyssinian Minister in Moscow. French Affairs. 21. M. Pierre Lafond has arrived in Tehran as representative of the National Committee of Free France. 22 A society for the study of French literature has been formed in Tehran. The French have been for some time concerned about the decrease of their long- established cultural influence in Persia, and this step may be an attempt to revive it.

All arrangements had been made for the opening of the Majlis on the 22nd January; invitations and programmes had been issued and the streets sanded for the Royal procession. On the 21st January it was announced that the opening had been postponed. This came as no surprise to many people as it was well known that the Shah, the Russians and certain Deputies were in favour of delaying the opening for various reasons. The pretext given was that there were insufficient Deputies present to form a quorum. Sufficient Deputies could, in fact, have been collected, but some were induced to absent themselves from Tehran. For some days previous it had been evident that the Majlis would not be opened if the Shah could prevent it. He had disquieting reports of the temper of a number of the Deputies in Tehran; he feared criticism of the changes, well known to have been due to his insistence, made in the Cabinet during the interregnum, and questions regarding the shooting of a striker at the munitions factory by General Shafai, the Shah’s nominee to the Ministry of the Interior, an incident about which the public is exercised because no public enquiry has been allowed. He is obsessed by fear of Seyyed Zia and the possibility of his forming a strong constitutional group of Deputies in the new Parliament that might be obstructive to his aspirations to autocracy. The Shah has been investigating the possibilities of finding pretexts for invalidating the election of Seyyed Zia, and he had seriously considered appointing in the place of Soheily, with whom he is very discontented, a new Prime Minister or a Council of State who would declare all the elections to be illegal because of official interference and other malpractices. He proposed then to issue by decree a new Electoral Law which would govern the new elections. Elated as he still is by his own evaluation of Stalin’s sentiments towards him. he was with some difficulty persuaded that there was too much danger in this unconstitutional procedure. Following so soon on the enforced inclusion in the Cabinet of his own nominees it would inevitably have been interpreted, possibly correctly, as an attempt on the Shah’s part to secure a subservient Majlis on the pattern so skilfully elected by his father. 2. To the Russian Seyyid Zia is still a bogey—the chosen instrument of British Imperialism. It is difficult to see where they find the smallest evidence to support this belief. His professions seem revolutionary enough to satisfy extreme Socialists, but the Tudeh press continues to attack him and the Russians to frighten the Shah with his alleged ambitions. 3 . The public and press are much excited by the publication of the news that a Persian pilgrim was decapitated by the authorities of Saudi Arabia at Mecca after being charged with defiling the shrine. The Government has issued a communique giving details and announcing that a strong protest had been made [50 54] &lt;y 42 to the Government of Saudi Arabia, who had been informed that unless adequate compensation w T as made and guarantees given for the future safety of Persian subjects the Government of Persia would prohibit the pilgrimage to Mecca for all Persians.

The following officers have been retired : — Sarlashkar Abdul Majid Firuz. Colonels: Hussein Shaibani; Qasim Vujdani; Amanullah Jalveh (Medical). Internal Security. Fars and Kuhigalu. 8. A meeting recently took place near Behbehan of Khosrow Qashgai and Abdullah Zarghampur which was attended by His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khuzistan and Colonel Humayuni, the officer commanding the Persian troops in Khuzistan. Ostensibly the purpose was to discuss with Abdullah Zarghampur ,i the surrender of the Germans known to be in his territory. He denied that they were there, but also promised that he would expel them within twenty-twenty-five days. He gave assurances to the Persian commander of his desire for peace and promised to surrender some of the arms taken from Persian troops at Semirum. There is no particular reason to believe any of these assurances. 9. It does not appear that General Jahanbani’s fears that Abdullah Zarghampur may create trouble in the vicinity of the oil-fields area have any substantial justification at present. His Majesty’s Consul-General considers that the reinforcements of three battalions which are being sent will exercise a sufficiently steadying influence. 10. In Fars the Mamassani are unsettled and will remain so until a settle ment is made of their land claims. Jahanbani has been discussing with Nasir Qashgai the question of the latter’s lands. He says he told Nasir that an essential condition of settlement was Nasir’s submission to Government and the disarma ment of the tribe. Bakhtiari. 11. It was feared that the long-standing jealousy between the two branches of the family of the Bakhtiari Khans—the Ilkhani and the Haji Ilkhani—might lead to trouble. Morteza Quli Khan, the Governor, has been appointing his own relatives to all available positions in the Bakhtiari to the exclusion of the other branch of the family who were beginning to show signs of restlessness. Morteza Quli, not content w T ith the present boundaries of his governorship, tried to3 persuade the Government to extend them to include Feraidan and the territories of the Bahmai and Western Janeki. This has been refused, but he has managed to get one of his sons, a military officer, appointed as Governor of Feraidan and to have the two Chahar Lang Khans of influence in that area, Muhammad Jawad Shujai and Muhammad Ali Mardani, detained in Isfahan. Morteza Quli Khan claims that during a visit to Tehran he placated the senior khans of the other ^jjpnch of the family by promises of benefits to come. Polish Affairs. 12.

IT has now been officially announced that the Shah will open the new Majlis on the 22nd February. There appears to be a fairly common belief that the Government will not survive many encounters with the Deputies. This uncertainty does not conduce to the co-operation of Government officials with their responsible Ministers. 2. The Military Governor of Tehran has issued a warning to the press and publishers that the following offences are triable without jury :— (i) Crimes attributable to any manifesto, declaration or any published matter other than books. (ii) Lese-majeste. (iii) Insult to the head of a foreign State or its diplomatic representative. (iv) Publications insulting to or defamatory of any representative of the nation; Ministers or their deputies; officials of the Court, Govern ment, Parliament or municipalities; judicial officers; members of municipal councils, chambers of commerce or electoral colleges; provided that the slander has no connexion with the office or function of the person concerned.

(ii) Abdul Vahid to the Farmandar of Qasr-i-Shirin. (iii) Abbas Quli Gulshayan to the Mayor of Tehran vice Bahrami, resigned. Persian Forces. Army. 4. The Soviet Ambassador has now informed the Shah that the tanks and aircraft promised by Stalin are now ready for delivery (see Summary dated the 5th December, 1943, paragraph 8). The numbers have been Gy Y V increased to 35 tanks and 30 aircraft—^20 bombers and 10 fighters. The Russians suggest that a tank regiment should be formed at Qasvin and an ^ air regiment at Meshed, each to have a strength of 600-700, of which one-third &gt; would be Russians, provided and paid for by the Soviet Government. This ^ w | P ro P osa l h as caused some alarm, since it might well be the foundation of a ^' 'C * | force partially officered/ by Russians and wholly under Russian influence to be used, as was the old Russian-officered Persian Cossack Division, for the \ furtherance of Russian policy in Persia. The Shah has, however, decided that, / since the tanks and aircraft are a gift, the Russian suggestions must be agreed TSO-*—83] J: STEP'S &lt;26,2 to. The Persian Government is to inform the Russians that the Persian army cannot at present find more than 100-150 officers and other ranks of a type suitable to undergo training in each regiment. According to a statement made by the Shah to a reliable informant, the tanks are 28-tonners. These will not only be a useless encumbrance to the Persian army, but are likely to be expensive toys. The above information should be treated for the present as most secret. 5. The Shah recently paid a visit of inspection to the Mechanised Brigade^^^ This brigade has been a bone of contention for some time between him and American advisers. The latter rightly regard it as a useless expense in present circumstances and recommended its disbandment. The Shah, on the other hand, wishes to expand it by the addition of armoured cars (which he has not got) and mechanised infantry. Its present constitution is— One anti-aircraft artillery regiment of eight 75-mm. Bofors A.A. guns. One battalion of four searchlights. One mixed artillery regiment of— Eight 105-mm. long Skoda guns. Four 150-mm. long Skoda guns. Four 150-mm. short Skoda guns. One battalion of anti-aircraft machine guns of 18, 15-mm. Besa machine guns. 6. At the annual ceremony for the presentation by the Shah of epaulettes to first-year cadets of the Military School the commandant announced that there were 336 cadets in the school. Police. 7. Mr. Timmerman, the American Director-General of Police, who has for some time been criticised in private, has recently been subjected to some criticism in the press. The number of thefts, assaults and robberies with violence in Tehran has been increasing, and Mr. Timmerman, who has powers that carry responsibility, is being accused of laxness in his task of reorganising the police. In an interview given to the press he stated that on the present wages of 1,000 rials a month it was impossible to obtain recruits for the police force; that in Tehran alone there was a deficiency of 800 constables; that the police force was seriously deficient in means of communication and means of rapid locomotion, and that he had demanded jeeps, motor cycles and telephones from the United States, so far without success. He went on to say that one of the greatest handicaps to the suppression of crime was the extreme leniency of the courts. He had also during the eight months of his official work in Persia had to deal with two Prime Ministers, seven Ministers of the Interior and three chiefs of police. Each change had meant that he had to get agreement all over again for his proposals. A 'ppointments — Military. 8. —(i) Sarhang Gulshayan to command the 5th (Luristan and Kermanshah) Division vice Sartip Iravani, recalled. (ii) Sarhang Hoshmand Afshar to command the 4th (Kurdistan) Division vice Sarhang Gulshayan, transferred. (iii) Sarhang Deihimi to be Chief of Staff of the Southern Forces vice Sarhang Muqbeli, relieved. (iv) Sarhang Siassi to be Head of the 2nd Bureau General Staff vice Sarhang Deihimi. (v) Sarlashgar Ali Asghar Naqdi (M.A. 196) to be Director of Conscription -vice Sartip Khosrow Panah, relieved. Internal Security. 9. Tribal areas remain quiet. In Pars the main interest centres around the elections and Nasir Qashgai’s manoeuvres to secure the election of candidates favourable to himself. He is endeavouring, by the expenditure of money and hints of his nuisance value to merchants and landowners, to persuade the people of Shiraz to elect him from that town. In this he has two objects : one to prove that he has influence outside the Qashgai tribe; the other, to make sure of the election of at least two Qashgai candidates, since no one disapproved of by the Qashgai is likely to get elected from Firuzabad. The Shah has, however, sent orders to General Jahanbani that he is to prevent at all costs the election ofs Nasir from Shiraz and to tell him that he will be accepted as a candidate for b iruzabad, the centre of his influence, only after he has handed over the Germans and surrendered Persian Government arms in possession of the tribe. Western Azerbaijan. 10. Kurdish chiefs of Western Azerbaijan were recently summoned to ^ th 0 Governor-General and admonished to keep the peace. The advice the Governor-General was supported by the local Soviet authorities. There is little disorder at present beyond occasional pillaging of villages, particularly by the Jalali Kurds of the Maku district. Russian Affairs. 11. Reports have been current in Tehran for some days of large increases in Russian garrisons in North Persia and of the impending arrival in Qasvin of several Russian general officers. No confirmation has yet been received of these reports. The Russian authorities say that fresh troops have arrived in Persia, but that they are in relief of the troops now here. 12. The elections in Tabriz are still in suspense owing to the continued manoeuvres by the Russians to secure the election of their approved candidates. His Majesty’s Consul-General considers that these candidates would have no success in free elections against the candidates put up by the landed and merchant classes, since Azerbaijan is still essentially conservative, but that, if the Russians were really determined on the election of their nominees, they might be successful, such is the fear of possible Russian reprisals. Azerbaijan still remains without a Governor-General owing to Russian opposition to every official suggested by the Persian Government. 13. Two prominent members of the Armenian Dashnak party have recently been arrested in Tabriz, one by the Persian police at the request of the Russians, the other by the Russians themselves. 14. The committee 'that was formed by the order of the Shah under the presidency of Sipahbod Amir Ahmadi for the collection of funds to relieve distress in Russia has announced that no further collections are to be made and that the committee will be dissolved as soon as the money collected and accounts have been received from the provinces. See also Summary No. 2, paragraph 18. Polish Affairs. 15. M. Henryk Strasburger, Polish Minister of State in the Middle East, has arrived in Tehran on a visit to the Polish refugees.

The date announced for the opening of the Majlis is the 26th February and not the 22nd as stated in paragraph 1 of Summary No. 4/44. Meanwhile, there is much preliminary intriguing going on among the Deputies and by the Court. 2. The Tudeh press has published protests signed by supporters of Nasir Qashgai against alleged Government interference in the elections of Fars. It was reported in Summary No. 4. paragraph 9, that Nasir was endeavouring to secure the election in Fars of candidates favourable to himself. The Govern ment has its own list of candidates besides being opposed to Fars being represented only in the Qashgai interest. The reason for the Tudeh, that is, Russian, encouragement of Qashgai candidates is not clear. It is certainly not I helpful to British interests in Fars. 3. Several police officials have been put on trial on charges of having been concerned in the death of certain prominent Persians during the reign of Reza Shah. They include Colonel Radsar, lately chief of police and Mukhtari, his predecessor, who is already undergoing a sentence of imprisonment. Defending counsel demanded that Reza Shah, who he alleged was the man really responsible for these deaths, should be brought to trial. 4. The Central Committee of the Tudeh party has announced that every member of the party is to pay 10 per cent, of his income for one month to the party office as a contribution to the fund for the relief of distress in Russia. Economic. 5. Dr. Millspaugh has published a regulation which calls attention to the fact that the Government has been put to heavy loss through contracts and agree ments concluded by various departments of Government. He therefore orders that no convention or agreement involving Government revenues, financial commitments or the cession or use of Government property shall be concluded without the approval of himself as Administrator-General of Finance. Two contracts where the Persian Government has lost heavily are those for the sale to the Russians of rice and of arms and ammunition manufactured in the Government factories. 6. It is stated in the press that in accordance with the terms of the Soviet- Persia Commercial Agreement the Soviet has delivered in exchange for rice :— 1,485,000 metres of cloth. 55,000 metres of silk textiles. Knitted goods to the value of 1,723,000 rials. Crockery and earthenware to the value of 2,075,000 rials. Bottles to the value of 850,000 rials. Newsprint to the value of 1,757,000 rials. Thread to the value of 612,000 riols. [50—85] sCT-C?, c/ Co' *7,2 7. The Anti-Hoarding Department announces that 2,000 charges of offences against anti-hoarding laws have been laid before the courts. There have been forty-eight convictions and 127 acquittals. 8. In the autumn of 1943 certain measures were taken by Russian and British autnorities to deal with an expected invasion of locusts from Indian Baluchistan and from Arabia. For this purpose the Government of India provided a mechanised battalion of Indian infantry and G.H.Q., Mideast, lent the Transjordan Frontier Force. The former was located near the Persian Gulf close to the Indian frontier and the latter in the Bandar Abbas-Jask area^ In addition, a flight of R.A.F. machines, specially fitted for the spraying oT swarms, was allotted to Task and ten Russian aircraft to the area nearer the Indian frontier, to operate from Jiwani (G-41 N. (1941) B. 5248). As, however, later conditions showed that an invasion from India was unlikely, in December the Soviet aircraft and Soviet specialists returned to Russia and the Indian | infantry battalion was withdrawn to India. The Transjordan Frontier Force will remain in the Bandar Abbas-Jask area for some time longer. 9. The following statistics regarding education in Persia were given by the Minister of Education at a recent ceremony where the Shah was present: — (i) Number of schools in Persia—Primary 2,392 Secondary ... ... 267 (ii) Number of pupils who received certificates during the past year from primary schools 17,158 (iii) Number of pupils who presented themselves for the final examination at secondary schools ... ... ... 26,501 A pfointments — Civil. 10.

Tehran, \Mh February, 1944. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 6 for the period 7th February to the \%th February, 1944. Persian Affairs. Political. 1. As the opening of the Majlis approaches the Shah shows increasing nervousness. He has been seeing a number of the Deputies, and it seems that these interviews have not increased his confidence in his own wisdom but have aroused anxieties as to the attitude the Majlis is likely to adopt towards his recent unconstitutional attempts to influence the course of events. It is also said that reflection and the views of others have raised fears of the possible consequences of his acceptance of the Russian offer to form Persian Tank and Aviation Units, with a strong framework of Russian personnel, from the tanks and aircraft which Stalin is presenting—see Summary No. 4/44, paragraph 4. He is likely to attempt to divert attention from himself by encouraging the growing hostility to Soheily, who is not expected to survive for long the opening of the Majlis. Saeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, seems to be his most likely successor. 2. The Tehran elections are now over, and the names of eleven successful candidates have been published in the press. The twelfth has not yet been announced. It is perhaps noteworthy that the three who have easily topped the poll, Dr. Musaddiq, Seyyid Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai, and Hussein Pirnia, have been genuinely elected on the merits of the esteem in which they are held and not as a result of bribery or the usual electioneering methods of candidates. No Tudeh candidate has been successful and only three of those especially favoured by the Shah. 3. Investigation into the charges against the suspects interned at Sultanabad is now finished as far as concerns those against whom the British have evidence. Thirty-two against whom the Russians claimed to have evidence, which they have not yet produced, have been handed over to the Persian Government for custody pending investigation by the Russians. Communications. 4. Attempts are now being made to exercise more effective control over the motor transport at the disposal of the Road Transport Department of the Persian Government. This amounts to 900 Lease-Lend trucks and 685 trucks under contract. Owing to lack of supervision many of these have been employed in carrying illicit loads at large profits. Eighteen British officers and nine British n.c.o.s have now been lent to the American director of the department to supervise the operation of the transport. The Persian Government has also issued regulations setting up a Department of Transport. The functions of [51—12]2 this department are those of Movement Control. All applications for the transport of goods by road or rail must be made to the department, who will allot priorities and inform the Iranian State Railways or the Road Transport Board. The department will also allot priorities to demands by Government officials for cars or accommodation in other means of transport. It will be in charge of a director responsible to the Administrator-General of Finance. A yyp ointments — Civil. 5.

A rmy. 6. The Soviet Government has invited a mission of Persian officers to visit Russia. They suggested that fifty might be sent, but the Persian Government has pleaded that it could not, in present circumstances, afford to send so many, especially as it has to find officers for training in the tanks and aircraft to be presented by the Soviet Government. It is probable that General Yazdan Panah will head the mission to Russia and that the number to accompany him will not exceed fifteen. It is proposed to detail about thirty officers for training in the tanks and Tifteen for training in the aircraft with about 100 other ranks in each case. 7. Colonel Atapur, C.B.E., lately Persian Military Attache in London, has returned to Persia. A pyointments—M ilitary. 8. Colonel Muhammad Baqir Amir Nizami to be head of the Second Bureau of the General Staff. ar Internal Security. Fars. 9. Nasir Qashgai may be realising that both the Shah and the Persian Government (some members of it) are considering measures to prevent him from having it all his own way in Fars. He is aware that General Jahanbani has been ordered to oppose his election for Shiraz and the election of his nominees. It is also likely that he is aware that General Jahanbani is reporting to Government that peaceful negotiations cannot succeed with Nasir and Khosrow. j Nasir has been making overtures to His Majesty’s Consul, but there is no : reason to believe that they are any more genuine than previous advances. His ; Majesty’s Consul maintains his attitude that he will have no discussion with Nasir until the Germans have been handed over. The Government is consider ing the appointment to Fars of Farajullah Bahrami (Dabir i Azam), the present Governor-General of Isfahan, a relatively strong and disinterested official, in place of Qavam ul Mulk, who is unwilling to return except on terms inacceptable to the Shah and the Persian Government. General Jahanbani says that he intends to propose to the Government a plan for the disarmament of the Qashgai by force, but it is probable that his demands for troops and arms will be more than the Government can find. The Persian army is not fit to carry out the protracted operations necessary for the effective disarmament of the Qashgai, and the political handling of the tribes since the Government withdrew its support from Qavam ul Mulk’s policy has not been such as to create allies for the Government or dissidence in the possible combination against the Government. 10. The situation is likely to increase unrest in Fars. A band of robbers alleged to have been assisted by Qashgai tribesmen attacked a village near Kazerun, whose inhabitants had been expressing loyalty to Government. On the 8th February a punitive party of troops and gendarmerie attacked the robbers, who are reported to have been reinforced by Farsimadan Qashgais. The Govern ment forces lost six killed and claim to have killed sixteen robbers, but His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz does not consider that the encounter ended in a victory for the Government forces. 11. It has been decided not to proceed with the operations for the disarma ment of Dashti—see Summary No. 48/43, paragraph 10; Ali Ismail, the rebel leader, and his armed men have escaped into the hills and are probably being3 c e le General Jahanbani has decided that he must reduce S ° 16 w ^ &lt; ^ raw i 11 g his trcx&gt;ps from Dashti and leaving a ff .u 011 a Military Governor at Khurmuj and a small garrison An , laai - his is the third time within the last two years that troops who n erec as iti tor the purpose of carrying out a disarmament have been with drawn without achieving their object.

General Jahanbani wishes to carry out the operation with troops supported by Bakhtiari levies. Morteza Quli Khan, the governor ot Bakhtiari, refuses to co-operate in an operation controlled by the army but guarantees to secure the disarmament and submission of these two tribes it Baiimai is included in his governorship and he is promised the support of troops if necessary. Colonel Humayun, the officer commanding the troops who would nave to carry out the operation, is content to do it with troops alone. K horns san. tz j 3 i Troupe looked like breaking out between the Turkomans and the Kurdish tribes of the Shirwan district of Bujnurd. Farajullah Khan of the aafaianlu Kurds had abducted a lurkoman girl and the Turkomans gathered to attack Kuchan. There were unconfirmed reports that there had been some lighting, but it is now reported that the dispute has been settled by the inter vention of Ardishir Khan of the Shahdillu Kurds. IT. Seyyid Ismail of the Zaidaranlu Kurds, a notorious robber of the Kuchan Bajgiran area, is reported to have been killed in a fight with Persian gendarmes on the 27th January. Western Azerbaijan. 15. In the latter half of January Kurds from Persia raided a Turkish village of the Barmish district, killed three villagers and carried off 3,000 sheep. Representations by the Turkish Consul to the Persian authorities were without result as the latter were powerless. The Turkish Consul then appealed to the Russians, who arrested the culprits and handed them over to the Persians. British Affairs. 16. His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran has been raised to an Embassy, as also has the American Legation. 17. Loid Knollys, chairman of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, and other officials of the company visited Tehran from the 10th to the 12th February. Russian Affairs. 18. Reports regarding alleged large increases in the number of Soviet troops in Persia continue to be circulated with so much assiduity and wealth of detail that it is natural to suspect that these reports are being deliberately put about | for some definite purpose. Those who believe them attribute these increases to a Soviet desire to bring pressure on either Persia or Turkey. They have created some alarm in Persian circles and there is information that the Turkish Embassy has been showing some concern about them. The Soviet military attache has stated that there is no truth in them; there have been some reliefs and exchanges of garrisons, but the only increase is a Pioneer Regiment for work on the roads. From other sources it is known that there has been no noticeable increase at Meshed, Tabriz or Kazvin. 19. The announcement recently made by the Soviet Government to the effect that the republics of the Union would in future be free to conduct their own foreign relations and to maintain their own armies has awakened gloomy forebodings in Persian minds. They foresee that in the near future Soviet representation in Persia will be reinforced by Ministers from Soviet Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and Turkmenistan. They expect to find Soviet Azerbaijan plotting to encourage the secession from Persia of Persian Azerbaijan, and Soviet Turkmenistan holding out open arms to Persian Turkomans. wk4 20. A formal meeting of the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society (see Summary^ No. 2/44, paragraph 17) was held on the 6th February. The Soviet Ambassador, who is honorary president of the society, said that its purpose was to bring together the savants and intellectuals of the two countries with a view to increasing friendship and understanding between Persia and Russia. The Executive Committee of the society includes Saeed, the Minister for Foreign x\ffairs; Hamid Sayyah, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs; Zand, Minister fo*^ War; General Yazdan Panah. 21. Ihe Soviet Embassy recently introduced to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a colonel of the Red Army as liaison officer with the Persian gendarmerie. 1 his officer asked the commandant of the gendarmerie to provide him with office accommodation in gendarmerie headquarters to ensure that liaison was constant and intimate. The real purpose presumably was to offset the influence of the American Chief of Gendarmerie. The request was politely refused. 22. For some months past a Russian officer with a staff has been stationed at Turbat i Sheikh Jam (75 miles south-east of Meshed) where he has been buying horses. A reliable source estimates the number of horses bought and sent to Russia as 1,600—1,700. Another source says that 800 of these were smuggled into Persia from Afghanistan 23. Queen Fowzieh attended the final meeting of the committee organised to raise funds for the relief of distress in Russia (see Summary No. 4 para graph 14). The President, Sipahbod Ahmadi, announced that 6 million rials had been collected and the Queen authorised the remittance of that amount to the Soviet Embassy. American Affairs. 24. On the 11th February the Shah was flown via Isfahan and Abadeh to Abadan in General Connolly s aircraft. At Abadan he visited the American Aircraft Assembly Plant and lunched with the staff before returning to Tehran. He was accompanied by General Connolly, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Communications, Generals Yazdan Panah and Razmara and some American officers. This is only the Shah's second flight. His first was also in an American machine, with Mr. Wendell Wilkie. Tehran, Y3th February, 1944.4DhX on e ! g s THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY oi^tf &amp;RITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

Tehran, 2\st February, 1944. 122 1. The Shah continues to discuss the political situation with all and sundry and to perplex himself with the conflicting advice that results. Aspirants to the premiership are endeavouring to create for themselves supporting groups in the Majlis. Seyyed Zia is building up a party, so far without name or programme, outside the Majlis. The Shah gave an audience to some members of the Majlis on the 16th February—representatives of parties, including the Tudeh, and inde pendent members. They assured him of their disinterested devotion to the welfare of the country and of their insistence that the law should be upheld. Ihe Shah urged that plans for the betterment of the country should be made on a programme of two or three years and insisted on the special importance of security, public health and education. 2. The Shah is reported to be giving people to understand that the Russians have guaranteed his throne. On the other hand it is said that his most trusted adviser, General Yazdan Panah, frequently reminds him that the British have already brought about the abdication of three Shahs Muhammad All, Ahmad Shah and Reza Shah. , 3 Dr. Millspaugh, who greatly objects to the contract made with the Russians for the manufacture of arms and ammunition in Persian factories since it entails expenditure from Persian finances without any repayment by the Russians has refused credits to the factories and consequently the workmen cannot be paid. The Minister of Commerce has offered his resignation and the workmen are threatening to strike and to take refugein theSpyiet_Embassy. 4. Hajhir, the recently-appointed Minister of the Interior, who has been on a visit to London, has returned to Tehran. Economic 5 The Treasury Bonds, whose issue was approved by the Majlis—see Summary No 38/43, paragraph 7—are shortly to be on sale They are to be of fhe value of 1000, 10 000, 100,000 and 1,000,000 rials and of two series-one maturing in three months the other in six.

He is a civilian, lately a director-general in the Ministry of the Interior and formerly in the army; at i ^ (ii) Police Lieutenant-Colonel Tura] Amm to be Chief of Police, Meshed. (iii) Ghulam Reza Nurzad to be Comptroller of the Court.Persian Forces. A rmy. 7. Without consulting the Chief of Staff the Shah ordered certain changes in military appointments, which are detailed in paragraph 11 below. The result is the removal from the Ministry of War and from the command of the 1st Division of two supporters of the Chief of Staff and of the American military mission and their relegation to less important positions. Into the Ministry of War is now introduced an officer who, together with General Razmara of the Shah’s military secretariat, has for some time past been in close contact with the Russians and who is regarded in the army as the Russians’ man. He is perhaps only so to the extent that he hopes for Russian support against the American advisers, of whom he has always disapproved. 8. These appointments will undoubtedly be interpreted as an indication of Russian influence in the army and of the Shah’s intention to acquiesce in Russian opposition to the American advisers. One object is probably to force the resigna tion of General Riazi, the Chief of Staff. The Shah has already informed His Majesty’s Embassy that he wishes to replace him by General Yazdan Panah and was told that in the opinion of His Majesty’s Embassy he would be ill-advised to do so. General Yazdan Panah showed few good qualities except financial honesty and some ineffective patriotism during his previous tenure of the appoint ment of Chief of Staff. He makes no concealment of his disagreement with the plans of the American advisers and he has always maintained that Persia needs an army in present circumstances of at least 110,000. 9. The Shah has again been expressing to the Chief of Staff his discontent with the American Military Mission. The real cause of his discontent probably is that General Ridley does not champion vis-a-vis Dr. Millspaugh the cause of a large army. 10. General Ridley says that the American Government has agreed to send nine more officers for his mission, making twenty in all. A ppointments — Military. 11. —(i) Sartip Ansari (Ghulam Ali) from Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry for War to be Director of the Military Tribunals (Judge Advocate General’s) Department of the Army. (ii) Sartip Abdullah Hidayet from Commandant of the Officers’ Cadet School to be Under-Secretary of State for War; (iii) Sartip Hassan Arfa (F.0.30, M.A. 37) from command of the 1st Division to be Commandant of the Officers’ Cadet School; (iv) Sarlashkar Shaqaqi (Hadi) F.O. 196, M.A. 270) from Director of Military Tribunals to command the 1st Division. Internal Security. Fars. 12. General Jahanbani has been in Tehran discussing the situation in Fars. He has given to the Government his definite opinion that negotiation will not secure the submision of Nasir Qashgai. Plans for military operations were discussed with the Minister for War and Chief of Staff. Morteza Quli Khan, the Governor of Bakhtiari, was asked if Bakhtiari co-operation against the Qashgai could be counted on and he replied, “ Only to the extent of benevolent neutrality.” It was decided that the spring was not a suitable occasion for military action against the tribes; the summer, when the tribes were settled in their summer quarters, offered more favourable opportunities. It is understood that the Shah has approved in principle that operations for the disarmament i of the Qashgai should take place in the summer. There is little chance of this I happening. 13. The choice of a Governor-General to succeed Qavam ul Mulk in Shiraz has not yet been made. Farajullah Bahrami—see Summary No. 6/44, para graph 9—like Qavam ul Mulk, has demanded authority and a free hand to an extent which the Government is unwilling to give. Kuh i Gain. 14. It is unlikely that any military operations will take place for the disarmament of Bahmai—see Summary No. 6/44, paragraph 12. Morteza Quli Khan, Governor of Bakhtiari, may be allowed to try and, see what he can do with his political influence with some troops in the background. .n—British Affairs. If • ^{? invitation of the Government of India a mission of three Persian van s is shortly to visit universities and other educational institutions in India. Ihe mission will consist of Ali Asghar Hikmat (F.O. 85, M.A. Ill), Rashid Yasimi and Pur Daoud. v h A Largely through the inspiration of officers of the Indian Army Medical ►services a medical society has been formed in Tehran which includes British, mencan, Indian, Russian, Persian and Polish doctors. They hold periodical meetings to the great benefit of Persian doctors. Russian Affairs. 17. There is still no confirmation of the rumours of large increases of Russian troops in North Persia referred to in Summary No. 6/44, paragraph 18. Ihe lurkish Vice-Consul at Rezaieh, who may be relied on to have investigated the matter carefully, has informed His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz that there has been no increase west of Lake Rezaieh (Urumieh). He estimates the present Russian garrison at Rezaieh at 500-600 and approximately similar numbers at Shahpur, Khoi, Maku, Bazirgan. He states that from the junction of the Turkish and Iraq frontiers to Shahpur there are not more than five Russian posts of thirty to forty men each in the vicinity of the Persian-Turkish frontier. An unusually large number of junior officers has, however, been noticed in both Tabriz and Qazvin. 18. General Yusefovich has relieved General Gaidukov at Tabriz in command of Soviet troops in North-West Persia. 19. M. Nikolai Klimov has arrived in Kermanshah as Soviet Consul. 20. The Soviet Civil Hospital in Tehran, to which reference was made in Summary No. 41/43, paragraph 13, is now advertising daily in the Persian press. In addition to the usual medical attention it offers physiotherapy, dentistry, treat ment of venereal diseases (with a private door), bacteriological examination, beauty treatment, mud baths with mud from Lake Urumieh and private C£ luxe ” maternity wards. A merican A ffairs. 21. Following on his trip by American aircraft to the American aircraft assembly plant at Abadan, reported in Summary No. 6/44, paragraph 24, the Shah, who was accompanied by the Queen, visited on the 16th February the very well-equipped camp of American troops at Amirabad near Tehran.

Tehran, 2^th February, 1944. Enclosure. Military Attache’s Intelligence Summary No. 8 for the Period ^Xst-^lth February, 1944. (Secret.) ——— Persian Affairs. Political. THE Shah opened the Majlis on the 26th February. In his speech, after referring to the Tripartite Treaty of Alliance, to Persia’s declaration of war and to the Tehran Declaration, he stated that his first object was that the Constitutional Law should reign supreme throughout the whole structure of the country and that each of the three ‘ ‘ powers ’ ’ (he presumably referred to the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary) should within the spheres allotted to them by the Fundamental Law spare no effort to fulfil the duties legally imposed on them so that the Government could devote all its energies to the improvement of social and economic conditions, with particular regard to public health and education. To this end it would be necessary to endeavour to develop the resources of the country, particularly its agriculture and its mines. His second object was to improve general security and to establish order throughout the country. This required the strengthening and increase of the security forces. It was also his object to ensure the independence of the Judiciary. These objects could only be achieved by fruitful collaboration between the Majlis and the Government. He, for his part, would always support pro gressive and patriotic parties and all those who strove for the happiness of the nation. 2. Amir Jang Bakhtiari wms elected temporary President of the Majlis. A new election will be held as soon as the credentials of two-thirds of the Deputies have been accepted. This will probably take three to four weeks, and no legisla tion can be effected until it is completed. 3. The Soviet announcement that republics of the U.S.S.R. would in future have freedom in their foreign relations has aroused particular interest in Azerbaijan. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that Moslem opinion generally regards it not as a change of heart, but as a move of political expediency. Always sensitive to any sign of increasing Soviet penetration, the Azerbaijan Moslems fear that the new principle opens up possibilities of a greater Azerbaijan; Armenians, on the other hand, welcome the step. They are generally anxious to see the stabilisation of Soviet influence in Azerbaijan in the hope that it will protect them against possible Persian reprisals. 4. The Ministry of the Interior has announced the release after investiga tion of twenty-three' of the detenues arrested at the request of the Allies (see Summary No.'6/44, paragraph 3). 5. The absconding priest, Seyyid Abul Qasim Kashani, got enough votes in the Tehran elections to put him among the successful candidates. In order to give the Persian Government good grounds for declaring him ineligible for election, if they wish to make use of them, the British Embassy has published a statement showing Kashani’s intimate connexion with Mayer and with German plots in Persia. [51—43]2 6. The trial of certain officials of the police for complicity in the murder of certain Persian notables in the reign of Reza Shah is finished (see Summary No. 5/44, paragraph 3). One of the accused has been sentenced to death, three others to imprisonment for life, ten and nine years respectively. Economic. - 7. Dr. Millspaugh has issued a circular to all officials of the Finance Department in the provinces stressing the Finance Ministry’s concern that monopoly goods—that is, cloth, tea and sugar—should be distributed regularly and impartially. Where stocks are available, distribution should continue or begin at once. Demands should be forwarded to the Ministry for Supplies necessary to maintain at all times stocks sufficient for six months’ consumption. In each distribution centre a commission is to be formed of the Finance Agent, the Bakshdar and reliable local notabilities to control distribution among the villages and in tribal areas. The distribution within the village or the tribe is to be entrusted to a committee of local notabilities. These local committees will prepare a list of the inhabitants of their village or tribal units, with the number of their identity cards, which will form the basis for the supply of monopoly goods. Finance agents are to see that the people are aware of the quantity of goods issued for distribution and their prices. 8. Dr. Millspaugh has created a special section in the Ministry of Finance which will control the Departments of Transport, Rationing and Distribution, formerly controlled by the Price Stabilisation Section. The duties of this section are : the rationing of all monopoly goods except grain and bread; the transport of such goods for distribution to the appropriate centres; their distribution to the consumer; and the administration of Government markets. The section will control all monopoly goods from the time they are released from customs, if imported, or from the time they are notified by the Procurements Department to be available, if produced locally. 9. The Minister of Commerce and Industry (General Shafai) has resigned on the ostensible grounds that the Administrator-General of Finance has refused funds for the payment of the wages of employees of the munition factories working for the Russians (see Summary No. 7/44, paragraph 3). Dr. Millspaugh, in an interview given to the press, said he would shortly authorise the payment of wages to employees of the factories of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for the month that ended on the 21st February, but he considered that State factories should be self-supporting and should not be dependent on subsidies, as were the munition factories. He hoped shortly to make arrangements that would render these subsidies unnecessary. The necessity for the subsidising of the State munition factories arises from the omission of the Russians to pay for any of the products they take. 10. The interest to be paid on the Treasury bonds, whose impending issue was reported in Summary No. 7/44. paragraph 5,^ is 4 per cent, per annum on the three-month bonds and 44 per cent, on the six-month bonds. 11. His Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas reports that 25,000 tons of red oxide have accumulated at Hormuz awaiting buyers. A 'p'pointments — Civil. 12. —(i) Rahmat Atabegi to the Persian Consul at Beirut. (ii) The new chief of police, Muhammad Hussein Mirza Jahanbani, has been given the police rank of Sarpas, equivalent to brigadier. Persian Forces. Army. 13. One of the Russian-inspired Persian papers recently commented on the alleged decision of the Soviet Government to present to the Persian army the full equipment for a motorised formation, consisting of aircraft, artillery, tanks, anti-aircraft guns and motor vehicles. One of the defects, it said, of the Persian army of to-day was that it had no experience of fighting or knowledge of modern weapons. If the news was true, then the gift would do much to remedy these defects and to inspire the officers with a new spirit. But officers should remember that, although discipline should inspire the army, it should never be allowed to develop into blind obedience. An officer was first a citizen, and he must not allow himself to be used against the interests of the nation. The training that personnel of the Persian army would receive from the Russians in these new arms would teach them the real spirit of soldiering and enable them to found a well-trained military organisation.3 * anvthino- mnr* th** lu rea ® on to believe that the Russians have offered Sum mar v No 4/44. 11 6 tan ^ s an d thirty aircraft mentioned in the nremrmaKhr ’ .P a ^ a ^ ra P^ ^ would be a mistake to read too much into Invi Mip J 111 spired press article referred to above.

It may also be interpreted as an incite- p e 4 - U ] Se -j° acc . e P^ ^be authority of the American advisers should the hr vemment decide to invest them with authority. 15. As far as is known, no definite answer has yet been given to the Russian otter to establish mixed Russo-Persian regiments of tanks and aircraft. There is already opposition among the Deputies to the acceptance of the gift of tanks and aircraft even without conditions. It is likely that there would be violent opposition to the formation of mixed regiments if the suggestion were knowm to the public. Gendarmerie. 16. The contract for the engagement of Colonel Schwarzkopf and a mission i? ii I ^ eriCan °bi cers the reorganisation of the gendarmerie includes the following conditions :— (i) The task of the mission is to advise and assist the Persian Ministry of the Interior in reorganising the gendarmerie. (ii) The period of the engagement of the mission shall be for a minimum of two years, i.e., until the 1st October, 1945. It can be cancelled at three months’ notice on either side and it may be renewed after the expiry of two years. (iii) Officers of the mission will serve in the rank they hold in the American army or in any higher rank they may be given by the Persian Government. They will take precedence over all Persian officers of equivalent rank. (iv) The head of the mission shall have “control of gendarmerie organisa tion for the duration of this contract and he will take precedence over all officers of the Imperial Gendarmerie. He is in direct charge of the control and organisation (of the gendarmerie) and has the right to make proposals to the Shah, through the Minister of the Interior, for the promotion, appointment, degrading or dismissal of all ranks of the gendarmerie. No other person has the right to interfere.” (v) The Persian Government agrees that during the period of this contract it will not engage officers of any other Power for work with the gendarmerie. (vi) All members of the mission undertake not to disclose to any national of a foreign Power official secrets learnt in the course of their duties. Internal Security. Kuh-i-Galu. 17. Morteza Quli Khan, Governor of Bakhtiari, and General Jahanbani are now in Khuzestan concerting politico-military measures to induce the Bahmai to surrender some arms. Meanwhile, Persian troops have been concentrated at Rud-i-Zard. It is likely that the Bahmai will surrender sufficient arms to save the face of the Government authorities and avert military operations. 18. The Persian commander in Khuzestan reports that Abdullah Zarghampur Boir Ahmadi has handed over fifteen light machine guns, one mortar and some other equipment taken at Semirum, but only one rifle. In return, he was asking to be given authority over the Dushmanziari and one section of the Taiyibi. He also reported that the Boir Ahmadi were handing the Germans back to the Qashgai. British Affairs. 19. During the last ten months a mobile dispensary, provided by Persia and Iraq Force, under a British officer, has been touring tribal areas, the result of this evidence of the interest of the British authorities in the welfare of the tribes has been wholly good. The visits of the dispensary have been everywhere welcomed and it has been hospitably received; genuine gratitude has been shown for the attentions of the medical officer. Much valuable information about conditions in the tribes has been obtained. The tribes visited include Arabs, Lurs Kurds, Bakhtiari, Qashgai, Mamassanni and some sections of the Boir Ahmadi. Many more of these dispensaries could be employed with advantage.4 jHi Russian Affairs. 20. In Tabriz there are many rumours of the impending arrival of large numbers of Russian civilians who, it is alleged, will be sent to Persia to take advantage of the plentiful supplies of food in the north. Some officers’ families have arrived, and His Majesty’s Consul-General reports that the Russians are renting and requisitioning additional accommodation. There are larg^^ quantities of surplus grain, which should be, but are not, sent to Tehran, and of dried fruits, whose export from the province is prevented by the Russians. The latter are buying large numbers of animals and quantities of butter and vegetables for export, with the result that the prices of these commodities are rising. 21. M. Kruskov has arrived in Isfahan as Russian Consul. Chinese Affairs. 22. A Chinese goodwill mission, which has been in England and Turkey, has arrived in Tehran as guests of the Persian Government.

The expected attack in the Majlis on the credentials of Seyyid Zia ed Din was made not by the Tudeh party Deputies, but by Dr. Musaddiq (Musaddiq es Sultaneh—F.O. 135; M.A. 184). ‘ It was based not on the legality of his recent election for Yezd, but on his unfitness to be a Deputy owing to his haying acted against the legally constituted Government of Persia by his participation in the coup d'Etat of 1921, which brought Reza Khan to power. Dr. Musaddiq at that time was Governor-General of Ears, and refused to recognise the Government formed by Seyyid Zia. In the course of his speech and Seyyid Zia s reply much old history was retold, not always accurately. The old story, which finds, and perhaps always will find, many believers, that the coup d'Etat was engineered by the British, was brought out to show that Seyyid Zia must then have been a British tool and to support the suggestion that he had been brought back to Persia in the interests of British policy. In his reply Seyyid Zia made a good impression on the Deputies, and the result of the debate is to improve his standing in political circles. He was supported by fifty-seven Deputies of eighty-six present. Dr. Musaddiq maintained his old reputation as an emotional demagogue, 'possibly well-intentioned but certainly misguided. . 2. Attempts were made during the two days’ debate on Seyyid Zia s credentials to organise demonstrations against him by crowds assembleo outside the Parliament buildings. The Tudeh party is accused of having been the organisers. Seyyid Zia’s supporters are also accused of having taken counter measures. 3 Certain recent events have tended to disturb public opinion and to shake public confidence in Great Britain’s ability to guarantee the fulfilment of the Tehran Declaration regarding Persia’s post-war status. They are, firstly, the announcement of the departure of the British Military Mission from Turkey and the knowledge that Turkev had refused to commit herself to the side of the Allies; secondly, Mr. Churchill’s'statement that the end of the European War might not come this year; and, thirdly, the British attitude to Poland and Yugoslavia, which is interpreted as an indignation of British subservience to Russian wishes. Economic. 4 Reports from the provinces of Isfahan and Ears indicate anxiety about ^ the comma- harvest owing to shortage of snow and rain. In areas of South-East Ears the crops are already considered to have failed and famine conditions to be imminent. See also Summary No. 9/44, paragraph 6.

A column of Persian troops, some 1,500 strong, has marched peacefully through the Bahmai country and was to go on to Izeh (Malamir) in Janeki, the scene of a minor disaster to Persian troops in May 1943, since when the area has not known them. The column was accompanied by General Jahanbani and Morteza Quli Bakhtiari. The Bahmai surrendered some arms and the military commanders have brought to notice at an appropriate moment, the Noruz promotions being under consideration, that they dare venture into tribal country. Honour is satisfied, although the Bahmai are not Boir Ahmadi nor even Qashgai. Fars. 7. There is further reliable evidence of the increase of Nasir Qashgai’s influence throughout Ears. In addition to the Mamassani, whose inclination towards Nasir was reported in last week’s summary, the Khamseh tribes are now reported to be drifting into his orbit. It is true that General Jahanbani’s policy, which is partly imposed on him by the weakness of the Government and partly by his own propensity to seek the immediate easy way, is keeping the peace for the moment, but it is creating a serious problem Which the Government will have to tackle some day. And if the tribes do not create disturbances during the spring migration it will be a proof of the strength of Nasir’s influence over them rather than of their fear of reprisals by Government. It is a reasonable hope that Nasir will endeavour to show T that he can keep the tribes in order. Russian Affairs. 8. The report in Summary No. 9/44, paragraph 17, to the effect that there is now to be a unified Soviet command in Persia has been confirmed. An officer, Lieutenant-General Sovietnikov,senior to Lieutenant-General Gaidukov, has arrived to take up this command. Gaidukov remains as deputv Commander-in- chief and Major-General Erishkeyitch has been appointed Chief of Staff. It is understood that the Transportation command under General Kargin remains independent and continues to be under the direct orders of Moscow.^ 9. More authentic reports than the rumours recently circulating have been received of an increase of Russian troops along the Persian—Turkish frontier, notably at Shahpur, Khoi and Bazirgan. I he reports come from two sources and speak of considerable numbers, but it should not yet be accepted that these are more than normal reliefs. British A ffairs. 10.

IN accordance with custom, the Government resigned as soon as the new Majlis was legally constituted. At a secret session a majority of the Deputies decided to recommend to the Shah that Muhammad Sa’ed , Minister for Foreign Affairs since June 1942, should be asked to torm a”new Gabinet. The Shah has accepted this advice. It is expected that the new Cabinet will not differ greatly from the old. Sa’ed is an honest and well-meaning gentleman, without initiative, ambition or power of organisation or leadership. He, however, starts with one unusual advantage : having had no desire to be Prime Minister, he has not had to make promises for the future to Deputies and others to secure their support. 2. Mirza Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai has been elected President of the Majlis, narrowly defeating Dr. Musaddiq. Malikmadani and Amir Taimur have been elected Vice-Presidents. 3. The Tudeh press in a series of violent articles is venting the disappoint ment felt by the party at the failure of the attempt to unseat Seyyid Zia. Popular opinion regards Seyyid Zia’s success as a defeat for the Shah and the Russians and a victory for the British. Economic. 4. Increases of pay have been sanctioned by the Government to sugar factory employees of 30 per cent., and to telephone workers, who were recently on strike, of 70 per cent, on salaries up to 1.000 rials per mensem with, in addition, a cost-of-living allowance. The workers in the Tehran Silo have now gone on strike as a protest against the delay in giving them certain promised concessions. They are preventing access to the Silo and the unloading of lorries bringing in wheat, thus dislocating the programme of the collection of grain. 5. The Persian press announces the arrival in Tehran of American and British oil concession-hunters interested in that part of Persia not covered by the xAnglo-Iranian Oil Company concession.

Abdullah Zarghampur, Boir Ahmadi, has written to Nasir Qashgai informing him that the Taiyibi and Bahmai tribes have appealed to him for help [52—18]2 /'-N against the Persian military operations for their disarmament (see Summary No. 10/44, paragraph 6). He wanted Nasir's advice and to be assured of his support. A British officer was visiting Nasir when this message was received, and he reports that Nasir was greatly upset. He accused the British of ( instigating these operations as preliminary steps for the disarmament of the tribes; he threatened danger to the oil-fields and fire and sword from Khuzestan to Persian Baluchistan. There is, in fact, no present intention of attempting to disarm the Taiyibi, but it is perhaps significant that the report that the Persian forces had even the hardihood to venture to challenge these relatively weak ! tribes was sufficient to cause Nasir so much concern. He may not be so confident of his position as recent reports have indicated. Luristan. 8. By agreement between Persian and Iraq authorities, Bani Lam tribesmen, suffering from a shortage of grazing in Iraq, were allowed to move their flocks into the Pusht-i-Kuh area of Persian territory. Some clashes occurred with Persian gendarmes who attempted to confiscate the rifles which the Arab tribes had brought with them. Western Azerbaijan. 9. The disturbances near Shahpur, referred to in Summary No. 9/44, paragraph 15, were created by Shikak Kurds as a protest against the levy from ' * them of 800 sheep to be delivered to the Turkish authorities as compensation for a recent sheep-stealing raid by Persian Kurds in Turkish territory. The Shikak pleaded that they were not the culprits. They, however, obeyed the order of the Soviet Consul to return to their homes. Russian Affairs. 10. Further reports have been received which tend to confirm that increases have recently been made in Russian garrisons in Khoi, Shahpur and Bazirgan, on the Perso-Turkish frontier. Moreover, the Persian authorities have been asked to deliver urgently additional quantities of barley, much of which is being despatched to Khoi. If increases have taken place, they do not necessarily have any particular significance. The Russians frequently change their troops in Persia, and there are sometimes more, sometimes less. At the present moment there is a tendency to attach undue significance to any reports of Russian movements near the Turkish frontier. American Affairs. 11. The Government has sanctioned the engagement of an American with two assistants as expert advisers to the Tehran Municipality.

THE new Prime Minister is having difficulties with the Majlis over the composition of his Cabinet, in spite of the fact that the Deputies had assured him that they would give him a free hand, expressing, however, the hope that he would select his ministers from the young, progressive and honest. Sa’ed intended to retain the Cabinet as it was, with the exception of Seyyid Mushin Sadr, the Minister of Justice, and making a new appointment to the vacant Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Majlis, however, indicated that this did not fall within their interpretation of a free hand, and the representatives of so-called Majlis parties demand that more of the young and progressive should be repre sented, but they have refrained from specifying the individuals who would meet with their approval. The five days of the Noruz holidays postponed the issue. Economic. 2. The absence of spring rains in large areas of the country is arousing anxiety regarding the next harvest, with the inevitable result of a rise in prices in the wholesale and free retail markets and an increase of hoarding and specula tion. The immediate grain situation is satisfactory, some 300,000 tons of the 310,000 required to feed the towns until the next harvest having been collected. But the latter figure includes no reserve, and the Government should have a reserve of at least 50,000 tons. The prospects of collecting this amount are not good, although there are still stocks of grain in the country. Of 18,000 tons expected from Azerbaijan only 700 tons have as yet reached the capital.

Ferouhar has been a Minister in Reza Shah’s Cabinet and was Deputy for Tehran in the last Majlis. General Ali Riazi w^as Chief of Staff. He is not ill-suited to his present post, but his appointment to the Cabinet is probably due mainly to the Shah’s desire to get rid of him politely from the General Staff with a view to the appointment of General Yazdan Panah. Assadullah Mamaghani was a Judge of the High Court of Appeal, with a none too good reputation as regards his sentiments towards the Allies. Mahmud Fateh was Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture. Nariman is a former Director-General of the Department of Indirect Taxation. Bayat, who has been included in the Cabinet mainly for the purpose of relieving the Prime Minister of parliamentary work and to deal with Deputies, for which he is better qualified than the honest and not too eloquent Prime Minister, was Minister of Finance in Soheily's second Cabinet in the spring of 1943. The reactions of the Majlis are not yet known, but it will be surprising if this Cabinet has a long life. Tehran. 26^/?

The Prime Minister then invited the Deputies to furnish him with a list of thirty persons acceptable to them from which he would select his Ministers. By allowing that the Deputies might dictate to him the composition of his Cabinet the Prime Minister has weakened his position, and even among the Deputies one of the five parties which have been formed and the independents, who have joined no party, profess to be averse to any such intervention by the Majlis. It is understood that a good deal of the opposition of the /Deputies to the present Cabinet is concentrated against Ibrahim Zand, the Minister for War. Dr. Ghani, the Minister for Public Health, and General Riazi, the Minister for Education, because it is believed that they were nominated by the Shah. Two of his selections in the previous Cabinet, Nuri Isfandiari and Nasrullah Intizam, have already been dropped. The opposition of the Deputies to these Ministers arises not so much from objection to them personally as from resentment at the Shah’s inter ference. There is a very strong feeling in the Majlis that the Shah's activities must be confined within strictly constitutional bounds. Dr. Millspaugh, too, is likely to come in for vigorous criticism 2. Five parties, or rather groups, since, with the exception of the Tudeh, they are not political parties in the ordinary sense, have been formed in the Majlis. They are the Democrats with 19 members, the Ittifaq-i-Milli with 13 members, the Tudeh with 8 members, the Mihan with 19 members, and the Iran with 11 members. The last-named is composed entirely of Deputies from Khorassan. These groups include 69 of the 108 Deputies elected up to the 2nd April. Some Deputies who are likely to be influential in the Majlis, notably Seyyid Zia-ed-Din Tabatabai, Seyyid Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai, Dr. Musaddiq and Ali Dashti, have not joined groups. There are still twenty-eight Deputies to be elected, mostly from Azerbaijan and Fars. Of the 108 Deputies already elected, the certificates of election of eighty-three have been accepted by the Majlis. 3. The Prime Minister announced the programme ol his Government as collaboration with Persia’s allies on the basis of mutual respect for each other’s rights and interests; strengthening of friendly relations with friendly and neighbouring countries; re-establishment of public security and faithful execution of the laws; measures to assure the provision of food and essential needs of the population; measures to assure to peasants and the working classes the essential minimum in food, housing, hygiene and education; administrative reorganisation to associate the people more closely with the administration of ,J52—75] I2 local affairs; long-term plans for agriculture, industry,*commerce, public health and education; improvement of the situation of Government employees; encouragement for the deserving and punishment for the delinquent. 4. A Tradesmen’s and Guilds’ Union has been formed in Tehran whose alleged objects are to improte the economic position of the country; to fight against speculation and profiteering; to promote charitable works; to protect workers and employees of trades and guilds; and to strengthen the system of parliamentary government. 5. The arrest and trial of Soheily, the previous Prime Minister, has been demanded by certain Deputies on charges of accepting bribes, unconstitutional interference in the elections, illegal suspension of newspapers and smuggling jewels out of Persia in the baggage of agents whom he had provided with diplomatic passports. Economic. 6. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that; owing to the ban imposed by the Soviet authorities on the export of dried fruits from Azerbaijan, great hardship is being imposed on growers and merchants. Estimated stocks are now 2,100 tons of almonds, 16,000 tons of raisins and 9,000 tons of peaches. 7. The municipal tax of 3 per cent, levied on all goods and food-stuffs brought to towns for sale has been abolished from the 21st March. A ypointments — Civil. 8.

Nasir Qashgai has been sending threatening telegrams to the Majlis and the Government. The people of Fars, he says, are so enraged at the interference of the Government in the elections (to which he likes to attribute his failure to be elected for Shiraz) and are so likely to # be driven to despair by famine that he dissociates himself from any responsibility for the good behaviour of the tribes. This mood, if it lasts, may result in some robbery. A village has already been looted—on the night of the 27th-28th March—in the near vicinity of Shiraz, but Qashgai complicity has not been proved. Nasir’s demands grow more ambitious. He is now hinting that he should be made Governor-General of Fars. General Jahanbani has tentatively resigned, possibly because he fears that the situation may get out of hand. Kerman. 11. In October last operations were carried out by Persian troops against an old tribal brigand of the Serjan district, Hussein Buchakchi, which resulted in his submission. His son, Akbar Khan Shujapur, however, remained an outlaw and has only recently surrendered himself, bringing in with him the rifles taken last year from the gendarmerie at Baft. The remaining prominent outlaw of this tribe, Murad Ali Murad, is still at large. British Affairs. 12. Since it has now been decided that an invasion of locusts into South- East Persia is improbable, the Transjordan Frontier Force Regiment and the R.A.F. anti-locust flight are to be withdrawn from the Bandar Abbas-Jask area (see Summary No. 5/44, paragraph 8). Russian Affairs. 13. Further information shows that the movements of Russian troops along the Turkish frontier, referred to in Summary No. 11/44, paragraph 10, were almost certainly merely normal reliefs. The increase in numbers is inconsiderable.3 RuTian^hr^W 00 r iles West , of - Meshed ’ comes reliable information that the to STrennrtf Z e « d n a nT m Ti 0datl0n there for fresh tr00 P s &gt; sufficient, according Russian trnnns’in 4; k This is certainly an exaggeration, but the arrival of Russian troops in Sabzawar is confirmed, and coincident with their arrival the fhe V Kh“aTtTe;hone e i| , n e es 0rdered ^ Cl ° Slng d ° Wn ° f a11 P ubUc traffic OTe '' X t ( The Tabriz elections are now finished, but the counting of votes will -like about another month.

Tehran, \Qth April, 1944. Enclosure. Military Attache s Intelligence Summary No. 14 for the Period Srd-Mh April, 1944. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. AFTER some days’ discussion, the different Majlis groups and the indepen dent members decided against giving to the Prime Minister a list of persons whom they considered suitable to be Ministers. On the 6th April the Prime Minister presented to the Shah his reconstituted Cabinet. Three of the five new Ministers he had presented the previous week—Mahmud Fateh, General Riazi and Mahmud Nariman—were dropped and in their places he introduced Nasir Etamadi as Minister of Agriculture and Dr. Sa’ed Malik as Minister of Hygiene; Dr. Ghani moved from the Ministry of Hygiene to the Ministry of Education in place of General Riazi and Ferouhar from the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs to the Ministry of Finance in place of Nariman. The former Ministry remains vacant. Etamadi was Under-Secretary of State in the Prime Minister’s office of Soheily’s Cabinet in 1943. Dr. Malik has not previously been in the Government. The Cabinet does not appear to be any stronger than its predecessor, and it cannot be said to contain anyone truly representative of the young and pro gressive, except possibly Hajhir, probably for the good reason that any such appointment would raise a storm of jealousy and hostility from all the disappointed young and self-styled progressives. It will not be greeted with any enthusiasm in the country nor raise hopes of better days; nor is it likely to be able to deal effectively with a Majlis which shows signs of being critical, trouble some and too disunited to be constructive. It may last longer than its merits would seem to warrant, since, of possible successors to Sa’ed, the only two who appear to have any real Majlis support are Qavam-es-Sultaneh and Seyyid Zia&gt; who, besides being opposed to each other, have both powerful enemies. 2. The Cabinet is now composed as follows :— Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs : Muhammad Sa’ed. Ministers without portfolio : Mustafa Adi, Morteza Quli Bayat. Industry and Mines : Amanullah Ardelan. Roads and Communications : Hamid Sayyah. Interior : Abdul Hussein Hajhir. War : Ibrahim Zand. Public Health : Dr. Sa’ed Malik. Education : Dr. Ghani. Justice : Assadullah Mamaghani. JU* Agriculture: Nasir Etamadi. Finance : Abul Qasim Ferouhar. Posts and Telegraphs : Vacant. a*r.3. The programme of the Government is the same as that reported in Summary No. 13/44, paragraph 3. Twenty-seven Deputies have announced their intention of speaking against the Government when the programme comes up for Majlis approval, but the forecast is that it will be approved by a small majority. 4. The Shah is reported to be .much concerned at the growth of Seyyid Zia’s influence in the Majlis. The Seyyid makes little secret of his intention to raise at an early date the question of the constitutional position of the Shah and to^^ have it defined by the Majlis. In opposition to Seyyid Zia, the Shah finds himself Allied to the Tudeh party, whose press continues its violent attacks. 5. Organisers of labour unions (Ittihadieh-i-Kargaran) are becoming more active throughout Persia. Such unions have existed for some time in the Russian- occupied zone, where they are closely affiliated with the Tudeh party, in Tehran, Isfahan, among railway workers, and recently among the workers of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company. In Isfahan, where they succeeded some time ago in forcing better conditions out of the factory owners, they have recently come under the influence of the Tudeh party, and the workers are now showing signs of an intransigentism that is frightening the owners and the capitalists of the town to such an extent that even the Governor-General has come to the conclusion that the situation can be dealt with only by the establishment of a military governor ship. There is a reluctance on the part of Persian officials to take action against movements which are suspected of being inspired from Russian sources. It is probable that the Tudeh party will endeavour to establish influence over all labour unions in all parts of the country. Economic. 6. The press has been making critical attacks on Dr. Millspaugh and his mission on the general grounds that the achievements of the American advisers do not justify their cost to the country. The discontent with the American Mission is widespread. They were never popular with the rich and the poor are disappointed that conditions have shown so little improvement from their point of view since their arrival. There is no noticeable decrease in the cost of living and monopoly goods—tea, sugar and cloth—which should be distributed at controlled prices on rationed scales, rarely reach the peasant or the tribesman. A weighty attack on Dr. Millspaugh has already been made in the Majlis by Dr. Musaddiq. 7. A beginning has, in fact, been made on a small scale with the distribution of tea, sugar and cloth. Rationed quantities of these goods have been issued to some Lur and Bakhtiari tribes on the railway and to some of the Kuhgalu tribes. Arrangements are also being made for issues to the tribes and, it is hoped, to some of the villagers of Ears. The nature of the communities selected for these first issues should be convincing proof of the value of a nuisance potential in attracting consideration. A appointments — Civil. 8. Ismail Bahadur! to be Farmandar of Ardebil. Internal Security. Ears. 9. Malik Mansur and Muhammad Hussein, brothers of Nasir Qashgai, have recently returned to Persia from Germany and have gone to the tribe. They were both educated in England, and after their experiences in Germany there is reason to hope that their influence on their brother will be good. Nasir, while still rebellious towards his own Government, is showing signs of desiring to get into the good books of British authorities. It is possible that he may find a champion in Seyyid Zia, who is playing for tribal support. This has increased the Shah’s uneasiness about the situation in Ears and his suspicions of General Jahanbani’s policy towards Nasir, with which he has for some time been very displeased. Kuhgalu. 10. The peaceful operations for the collection of arms from the Bahmai and Janeki tribes are now ended. The Janeki surrendered some 170 rifles, but the Bahmai did not carry out their promises of co-operation and, as far as is known, they surrendered few. if any, rifles. Their change of mind was probably due to the’ influence of Abdullah Zarghampur, Boir Ahmadi, who rightly appreciatedthat General Jahanbani would not risk a fight. The Bahmai consequently retain their arms and Government prestige has been still further lowered by the failure to carry through an operation which had been launched with no little advertisement. Russian Affairs. 11. It is reported, but has not yet been fully confirmed, that the Russians intend to operate a bi-weekly commercial air passenger service between Tehran and Meshed, beginning on the 23rd April. A trial trip was made on the 5th April.

Tehran, \7th April, 1944. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Sumrnary No. 15 for the period \tith April to MSth April, 1944. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. AFTER more than a week’s futile debating by the Majlis of its programme the Government was given a vote of confidence by 69 of the 90 members present, 9 voting against the Government and 12 abstaining. There is a larger majority than was at first expected, since 27 members had announced their intention of speaking and voting against the Government. That was perhaps due more to the desire of budding parliamentarians to secure an opportunity of airing their theories and gaining some publicity than to any conviction that in present circumstances the defeat of the Government would lead to anything oetter. During the debate Dr. Millspaugh and his colleagues came in for much criticism i and it is clear that the dissatisfaction with them is deep and widespread. Such defence of them as was attempted was half-hearted and did not go much further than to claim that Dr. Millspaugh himself meant well and that in principle an American advisory mission was desirable for the finance and economy of the country, if only for the purpose of keeping alive American interests in and sympathy with Persia. 2. Seyyid Zia’s relatively vigorous personality is creating some impression and causing some concern. The Court fears that he is imbued with hostility to the Shah and that he is determined to endeavour to bring about a limitation of the Shah’s part in the affairs of Government to that of a strictly constitutional monarch. The Shah has perhaps an uneasy conscience, for he knows that it is believed by Seyyid Zia and many others that he encouraged Dr. Musaddiq to oppose the acceptance of Seyyid Zia’s election to the Majlis and that he arranged for the hostile' demonstration of factory workers outside the Majlis on that occasion. Suspicious as he always has been that Seyyid Zia could not entertain friendly sentiments for the son of Reza Shah he now finds added reason to fear some act of revenge. There are others, too, who fear the effects on the country of a struggle between Seyyid Zia and his supposedly increasing band of followers on the one hand and the Shah and his paid intriguers on the other; others, the rich, who fear the advent to power of Seyyid Zia; and others who expect that if Seyyid Zia looked like being successful the Russians would attempt a coup d'Etat to prevent this victory of British policy. Several requests have recently been made by influential Persians to His Majesty’s Ambassador that he should mediate to effect a reconciliation between Seyyid Zia and the Shah. The Shah is perturbed. For some time he has had no indications of any particular concern on the part of the Russians for his welfare. He suspects, possibly with good cause, that the Russians have taken offence at the Persian refusal to accept the conditions that were attached to the Russian offer of tanks and aircraft—see [53—17]paragraph 9 below—and are annoyed by his failure to unseat Seyyid Zia. (The Tudeh party were persuaded to leave the attack entirely to Dr. Musaddiq, the Shah’s man for this purpose.) Now, doubtful of Russian support and almost convinced that Seyyid Zia was accepted by the Majlis as a result of British support and that his policy is laid down by the British Embassy, he hardly knows where to turn. For the time being he is making a show of giving his Government a free hand and of abstaining from attempting to influence the course of affairs, but he continues to have relations with dangerous and unprincipled intriguers. 3. The Hamrahan party, composed mainly of intellectuals with Socialist views under the leadership of Mustafa Fateh of the Anglo-1 ranian Oil Company, which has never made much impression on the public, has recently suffered the secession of some of its members who have formed a party called the Socialist Party of Iran. The reason for their secession is said to be their discontent with the lack of vigour shown by the Majlis representatives of the party—there are only two—in their opposition to the acceptance of Seyyid Zia’s election to the Majlis. The new party retains the party newspaper Imruz va Farda, and the old party has started a new^ paper Shama. 4. The proposal to make a new Shahristan (Governor’s district) out of the Bakshes of Saqqiz, Baneh and Sardasht in Kurdistan—see Summary No. 48, 1943, paragraph 6—has been abandoned. Saqqiz will remain in the Shahristan of Sanandaj, and Baneh and Sardisht in that of Mahabad. The Shahristan of Sanandaj, under the Governorship of Shihab ed Douleh—see Summary No. 11, 1944, paragraph 6—is now to be independent of the Governor- General of Kermanshah. Economic. 5. It is now estimated that the Government may have, when the new harvest begins to come in, a surplus of 25,000 tons of grain as a reserve. This, however, is not considered sufficient to put any effective check on hoarders or on the black market, especially in view of the unjustifiably gloomy reports that are being circulated about the coming harvest. Although crops have failed almost completely in some parts of South Persia, it is estimated that, taken as a whole, the harvest will not be below average. The prevention of famine in areas where crops have failed will depend on the extent to which the surplus crop can be collected in other areas and on distribution. 6. An earthquake occurred at Gorgan on the 5th April which, according to the Persian press, has destroyed or rendered uninhabitable all the houses in the town. The Shah and the Queen are now visiting the town. Persian Forces. Army 7. The Russians have refused to .allow American officers of General Ridley’s staff to be stationed at Tabriz and Meshed, the headquarters of the 3rd and 8th Divisions respectively. It is part of General Ridley’s scheme that an American officer should be attached to the headquarters of each division to reorganise the administration. The Russians have suggested to the Persian Government that if the Persian army requires advice or assistance they, the Russians, will be glad to give it. 8. The press reports that a number of olficials of the Conscription Depart ment in the provinces have been recalled to Tehran on charges of corruption. The application of the Conscription Law is one of the greatest scandals in Persia. Exemptions are secured not by virtue of the law but by bribery, and the result is that only the poorest classes reach the army. The present Minister for War has the desire to clean up these abuses, but it'has yet to be seen whether he has the strength to do so. 9. The general terms of the Persian reply to the Russian offer of tanks and aircraft—see Summary No. 9, 1944, paragraph 9—are that the Persian Govern ment accepted the offer with gratitude, but that, since they were to be a gift, they did not see the necessity for a formal signed agreement, as requested by the Russians, for the formation of new tank and aircraft units with a Russian instructional staff. The Persian Government proposed that they should send the necessary officers and men to take over, after they had been' instructed in their use, the tanks and aircraft at places convenient to the Russians. This replv was given to the Russians some six weeks ago and fairly reliable information is that since then the Russians have not reverted to the subject.3 \ 10. One ot the papers of the Tudeh party, presumably at Russian inspiration, has published an article advocating a strong army. But the army must belong to the nation, must find its support in the nation and be ready to fight against reaction and despotism. The article refers to the “ mysterious influences that are trying to reduce the strength of the army. Internal Security. 11. The northward migration of the Qashgai tribes has begun. It is reported that the return of Nasir Qashgai's two brothers to the tribe—see Summary No. 14, 1944, paragraph 9—with British permission and assistance has had a good effect on the tribe. V2. His Majesty s Consul-General at Bushire reports that following on the withdrawal of Persian troops—^see Summary No. 6, 1944. paragraph 11— disorder has again broken out in Dashti and Tangistan. The Dashti outlaw, All Ismail, who had taken refuge with Nasir Qashgai, has returned to Dashti, and the Tangistanis have recently been guilty of many robberies. Russian Affairs. 13. The impression is now gaining strength in certain circles that the Soviet Embassy is dissatisfied with affairs in Persia. The causes for this are alleged to be the ill-success of Tudeh candidates in the elections, the failure of the attempt to unseat Seyyid Zia and the refusal of the Persian Government to accept the conditions attached to the offer of tanks and aircraft. The omission of the Soviet Government to send to the Shah the usual telegram of felicitations at the Persian New Year and to acknowledge the Shah’s telegram of congratula tions on recent successes of the Red Army is regarded as convincing proof of Soviet displeasure. 14. The strength of the force of Russian troops whose arrival at Sabzawar was reported in Summary No. 13, 1944, paragraph 13, is reliably reported to be 600. No information of the impending arrival of these troops was given to the Persian Government or local authorities. 15. It is confirmed that the Russians propose to run an air service, probably fortnightly, between Tehran and Meshed and perhaps between Tabriz and Tehran. It will carry Russian and Persian passengers only. See Summary No. 14, 1944, paragraph 11. Polish Affairs. 16. An office of the Union of Polish Patriots has been established in Tehran under Russian auspices to the serious perturbation of the authorities in charge of the Polish refugees in Persia. In its endeavours to get into touch with these refugees the Polish Patriots have a strong card : they are offering to put refugees in touch with their relatives in Russia.

THL Majlis has passed a law authorising the adoption of three-twelfths oi the budget to regularise immediate expenditure pending the passing of the entire budget. . o r &amp; 2. Sa od s Cabinet has been the subject of much windy oratory and destructive criticism. Sa'ed himself is agreed by the majority of the Deputies to be an honest and gentlemanly fellow, competent in his own sphere of diplomacy, but quite incapable of holding his Cabinet team together or of putting into effect the items in his programme. Deep distrust of his possible rivals, and especially of Seyyid Zia-ud-din, is the sole reason for the limited support which the Deputies are prepared to afford him. 3. Both in the press and in the Majlis opposition to the American Mission has increased, and most papers have now passed the bounds of legitimate I criticism and have descended to scurrilous abuse. The Persian passion for hyperbole; their inability to consider the basis for the truth of any statement 1 before making it, and the absence of any law of libel has resulted in'bhe wildest utterances. Two American advisers are openly accused by name of havino- accepted large bribes. The attacks against Dr/MillspauglCand his associates are made from every angle, but the chief accusations are as follows :— (i) That they do not possess the necessary qualifications for their job. (ii) That they are too numerous. (iii) ,That they have accomplished nothing. (iv) That they are costing the country too much and are paid too highly. (v) That they create new jobs for still more Americans instead of training young Persians to do those jobs. (vi) That they employ unsuitable Persians and others (e.g., Armenians) in posts as confidential secretaries. (vii) That they behave in an autocratic manner and are subject to no control. Dr. Millspaugh, in a communique to the press, has replied to these accusations. On the whole his is a dignified and reasoned protest, and he points out that his chief opponents and most bitter critics are the racketeering, profiteering class who stand to lose most by the carrying out of his measures. He warns the nation that abuses are so widespread and the breakdown of governmental machinery so complete that it is useless to expect a speedy cure of those ills, and that some of his reforms may take years to come to fruition.

Casualties in the Gorgan earthquake (see Summary No. 15/44, paragraph 5) were at first reported to be slight (two killed and four wounded), though the destruction to buildings has been heavy. Subsequently, exposure to wet weather has caused much sickness, chiefly pneumonia. Elections. 6. Sheikh Abdullah Galledarian has been elected as a Deputy f° r ^- Bandar Abbas. ' Persian Forces. 7. Sarlashgar Razmara (M.A. 243) has been appointed Chief of the General Staff. The post had been vacant since the appointment of Sarlashgar Riazi as Minister for Education on* the 26th March in Sa’ed’s short-lived first Cabinet. The appointments of Commandant of the Officers’ Training College and Chief of the Shah’s Military Secretariat remain vacant. Internal Security. Isfahan. 8. There has been much unrest among mill workers in Isfahan for a long period. This unrest is partly economic in origin, but is much more largely due to the political rivalries of the Tudeh and anti-Tudeh parties, who squabble for the support of the workers and the right to represent them. A fight between these two parties occurred on the 18th April. Troops were used to restore order. The mills have remained closed since that date. The absence of a Governor- General (Bahrami resigned in early April) and of any clear-cut policy on the part of Government are delaying the settlement of the dispute. General Qadr, the General Officer Commanding Isfahan Division, who has for some time past been advocating the establishment of a military governorship, is in Tehran. The Under-Secretary for War stated on the 23rd April that Government did not intend to appoint a military governor. Mekran. 9. After a period of some weeks free from insecurity, a hold-up is reported of a U.K.C.C. truck on the 13th April, 18 kilom. north of Zahidan, and of three U.K.C.C. trucks on the 16th April, some 60 kilom. north of Zahidan. One child was killed and one child and a driver were wounded. Tyres and personal effects were stolen. The robbers are thought to be Baluchis, but there is strong evidence of connivance on the part of the gendarmerie. Ears. 10. The Qashgai’s northward migration continues, and has not, so far, produced any widespread pillaging, highway robbery or clashes with troops. Owing to the return of Nasir Khan’s two brothers to the tribe and the sobering influence of their recent and first-hand knowledge of war-time Europe, Nasir Khan may be reshaping his policy with regard to the elections co-operation with Government and restraining his tribesmen from acts ot brigandage. Russian Affairs. 11 The second aeroplane on the recently started Tehran-Meshed air service arrived in Meshed on the 12th April (see Summary No. 15/44, paragraph 15). As on the first run, it carried only Russian and Persian passengeis. Ine Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs state that permission to start this service has never been asked for by the Russians, though it is possible that the scheme may have been mentioned to Soheily or, more likely, Qavam-es-Sultaneh during 12 His Maiesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that there are signs of a concerted plan to increase Russian influence in Tabriz.

THERE is little in the situation to justify hope that Sa’ed’s Government will be able to make much effective progress. The Deputies continue to give daily proof of their irresponsibility and the press to publish defamatory reports about Dr. Millspaugh’s assistants and others without the slightest regard for truth. (The attacks against the American mission are slightly less virulent, and a few papers have even ventured to speak guardedly in their defence, but the harm done to their reputation throughout the country must be great. Seyyid Zia is causing increasing anxiety to his opponents by the attention he is attracting not only in Parliament but among the general public. He has lately proclaimed himself as an admirer and champion of the tribes, obviously with a view to gaining their support, but his contention that the tribes must be allowed to retain their arms to protect themselves against military oppression until they are assured of just treatment may have dangerous results. The Tudeh papers are loud in their condemnation of this reactionary suggestion, 2. The Prime Minister has announced the formation of a Tribal Commission to consist of the two Ministers without portfolio and two tribal Deputies, Amir Jang Bakhtiari and Abbas Qobadian Kalhur. In a statement the Prime Minister said that it was not the intention of the Government to act towards the tribes as in the past, but to endeavour to right the wrongs from which the tribes held suffered 3. A Bill was tabled by Seyyid Zia and thirty-one other Deputies whose purpose was to oblige Ministers to take an oath on appointment pledging themselves to perform their duties uprightly and honestly according to the Constitution and to the laws passed by the Majlis; to be loyal to the Shah; to do no treason to the principle of sovereignty or to the rights of the nation, to be guided solely by considerations of the interests of the Persian State and nation^ There was little discussion on the matter, and after some days a motion to remove the Bill from the agenda of the Majlis was approved 4 Dr Millspaugh has asked the Public Prosecutor to take action, under article 269 of the Penal Code (which deals with defamatory statements and publications), against the authors of the slanderous statements made about him g 'ppg Minister of Education, Dr. Ghani, has resigned from the Cabinet.

The last stage has now been reached in a plot which has been patiently worked out for months for the elimination from positions of influence in the army of a number of officers who were characterised by their determination to support the American military advisers and their belief in the value of co-operation with the British. For these reasons they were regarded unfavourabh^^ by the Russians, and it would not be unreasonable to assume that their eliminatioi^^ t is at least in part due to Russian influence. The first to be removed was General Ahmadi from the Ministry for War, and there is little doubt that his removal was a condition made by Stalin when he made his offer of tanks and aircraft to the Shah. The next to go was General Ansari from his post as Under-Secretary for War, and he has recently been relegated to unemployment. The next was General Riazi (see paragraph 13 of Summary No. 12/44), who was a strong opponent of the acceptance of the conditions attached to the Russian offer of tanks and aircraft, a fact of which the Russians were probably made aware by General Razmara. And now General Arfa has been relieved of the command of the 1st Division. General Razmara, who has recently been reappointed Chief of the General Staff, has been, since^he resigned from that post in September 1943, in close and intimate contact with the Russians (see ! Summary No. 42/43, paragraph 14). The Shah is well aware of his restless ambition, his infinite capacity for intrigue and mischief and his lack of principle, and it is unlikely that he would have taken the risk of appointing him to be Chief of the General Staff unless influenced by some extraneous consideration. It has been suggested that the appointment was dictated by the Shah's desire to regain Russian favour, which, as was reported in Summary No. 15/44. paragraph 2, he feared he had lost. 8. The budget for the army, including the air force, which has been made out for a total of 90.000 men, comes to between 140 and 150 million tomans. In their present temper the Deputies will only with great difficulty be persuaded to grant more than 100 million tomans. There is, consequently, no fear of the army this year exceeding 90,000; it is more likely to be reduced to a lower figure.

All the tribes of South Persia are now on migration. Whether the villages are suffering from the usual tribal depredations is not known, but there has as yet been little or no disturbance on the roads. Fars. 11. Labour unrest has now shown itself in Shiraz. The employees of the power station went on strike and there was trouble in one of the spinning factories. The arrest of three leading agitators, all of the Tudeh party, has temporarily, at least, restored order. This trouble followed shortly on the greatly increased activity of the hitherto inactive Tudeh party of Shiraz. There was a sudden drive to enrol new members and collect funds, presumably on the orders of the headquarters of the party in Tehran. Isfahan. 12. The mill workers of Isfahan returned to work on the 25th April. The terms of the settlement are not yet known. There is some evidence that some of the workers are growing resentful of the control of the Tudeh party and of the latter’s desire to exploit them for political purposes. Russian Affairs. 13. The Russians have now inaugurated a weekly air service between Tehran and Tabriz. The passenger fare is 1,200 rials for the single journey.

The Prime Minister is struggling with honesty and courage to carry out his task in the welter of intrigue by which he is surrounded, and with which his simple and straightforward nature is ill-qualified to deal. He gave a sensible and salutary lecture to journalists which had some slight effect on their irresponsible virulence. He dropped a bombshell into the Majlis by introducing a Bill, actually sponsored by the Minister of the Interior, proposing that the officials of all Ministries should for the period of the war be considered to have the same liability as officers and soldiers called to the colours; that factories, whether the property of Government or of private owners, and their workmen should similarly be considered to have been mobilised for national service; and that restrictions should be imposed on the place of residence of persons who have acted against the war time interests of Persia or her Allies, or wdio have instigated others to act against public order or who are engaging in activities likely to disturb the peace. This Bill is likely to arouse considerable opposition. 2. The situation that has arisen among the factory workers in Isfahan has figured prominently in the Majlis and in the press, and it has given cause for much violent abuse of each other by the Tudeh party and the supporters of Seyyid Zia, each accusing the other of attempting to stir up strife. There seems to be little doubt that the trouble originated in the aggressive action of the Tudeh members of the Workers’ Union in attempting to prevent the employment of certain workers who had refused to accept the control of the Tudeh party. In the resulting riot 500-700 workers were injured, most of whom were not members of the party. Troops had to be called in and the local authorities seem to have acted with reasonable firmness. The Tudeh party which includes 4.000 of the 10,000 members of the Workers’ Union in Isfahan then insisted on a strike. As reported in Summary No. 17, paragraph 12, the workers returned to the factories on the 25th April, but were unable to work as the owners would issue no materials. The present position is obscure. It is reported that opposition on the part of the workers to the control of the Tudeh pary is spreading, largely because the party demands a monthly subscription from the workers from which they receive no benefit in return. Much capital is being made by the opponents of the party out of the fact that no accounts have been published of the disposal of the estimated income of the party from these sources of 10-20,000 tomans a month. Much prominence has been given in the press and in the Majlis to the necessity for legislation to regulate the relations between employers and workers. Represen tatives of the Tehran Workers’ Unions congregated before the Majlis building anddemanded the passing of a labour la w, the prosecution of those who had instigated the Isfahan disturbances and the official recognition of the Labour Unions. 3. In Meshed on May day more than 2,000 persons took part in processions and a mass meeting organised by the Tudeh party. The processions shouted “ Long live Stalin, Lenin and the Red Flag.” 4. Seyyid Zia has given proof, disturbing to his enemies, of the esteem in which he is held in some quarters by collecting two million rials for the relief oji sufferers from the Gurgan earthquake. He continues to impress people by the/ forcefulness of his personality if not by his wisdom. 5. In Summary No. 13/44, paragraph 5, it was reported that certain deputies were demanding the trial of Soheily, the ex-Prime Minister, on charges of having attempted to influence the elections. These charges have been investigated by a Majlis Commission which has decided that they are without justification. Charges have now been made by a Deputy, who is also President of the Majlis, against Tadayyun of corruption during his tenure of office of Minister of Supply during the period March 1943 to July 1943. 6! The Shah, accompanied by the Queen and important officials of the Court, left Tehran on the 6th May for Shiraz. He is to spend a night at Isfahan and another at Persepolis. In view of the unsettled conditions of the working classes in Isfahan and of the importance of his Government in Pars, it is difficult to appreciate the considerations tHat prompted the selection of this time for this visit or to foresee what effect it will have on the situation at either place. It is unlikely that Nasir Qashgai will come to Shiraz to offer allegiance, and, since the Shah’s visit is not likely to be followed by any more vigorous assertion of the Government’s authority,' it may be interpreted as tacit recognition of the status existing—that is the supremacy in Pars of the authority of Nasir Qashgai. 7. The elections in Tabriz are now finished. Of the nine successful candi dates only two are from those supported by the Russians. Persian Forces.

The Prime Minister has appointed a Commission consisting of the Ministers of the Interior and for War and representatives of the General Staff, to consider measures for the improvement of security, first in the capital and then in provincial towns. Pars. 10. Nasir Qashgai has visited Shiraz for the first time for about two years, and has called on the Acting Governor-General and on His Majesty’s Consul, promising to use his influence to maintain law and order in the province. He returned to the tribe after a stay of a few days. Khorassan Mekran. 11. In Summary No. 16/44, paragraph 9, attacks on. and robbery of. U.K.C.C. trucks were reported to have occurred North of Zahidan. Since then, on the 1st May, in the same area a British military engineers’ truck was fired on and a Persian officer and his wife travelling by it were wounded. On the 2nd May a large party of armed Baluch raiders from Afghanistan carried off 150 camels from°a district South of Birjand. In this case the Persian gendarmerie and armed locals reacted with some vigour, recovered all the camels and killed three and wounded two of the raiders. In view of the insecurity prevailing on the Zahidan-Meshed road the Government of India has sent some mechanised troops for the protection of Aid to Russia convoys. Russian Affairs. 12. The Soviet Ambassador, M. Mikailov, has returned to Moscow, nominally on leave but probably on permanent recall, and has been replaced by his Counsellor, M. Maximoff, as charge d’affaires.

Tehran, 15th May, 1944. iV Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 19 for the Period Ith-lAth May, 1944. (Secret.) ——•—- Persian Affairs. Political. THE Bill To apply military law to Government employees and factory workers referred to in Summary No. 18/44. paragraph 1, has provoked attacks on the Prime Minister by the Tudeh press, where he is labelled as weak and reactionary and the tool of vested interests and of the enemies of Persian independence. Notice has been given by one of the Tudeh Deputies of intention to interpellate the Government on the recent appointment of Reza Afshar as Governor-General of Isfahan, it being alleged that he is ineligible for a Govern ment appointment owing to his having been convicted in a civil court. It is expected that the Government will survive the interpellation. 2. The Shah is reported to have had a good reception in Shiraz and has decided to prolong his stay. He is now due to leave on the 15th May. He was entertained by Nasir Qashgai’s brothers, Muhammad Hussein and Khosrow, but Nasir himself did not come in. 3. The mill-workers’ dispute in Isfahan has been settled for the time being. It has been agreed that membership of the Workers’ Union shall be unrestricted; that strikers shall return to work and the workers recently expelled (at the instance of the Tudeh party) shall be re-employed; that there shall be no propa ganda inside the factories; and that the disputes between employers and workers shall be dealt with by a special committee comprising the Governor of Isfahan and representatives of the Ministries of Justice and of Commerce and Industry. Economic. 4. In reply to questions in the Majlis, the Minister of Finance stated that the Government had under consideration certain applications for the grant of new concessions to foreigners for the development of new oil-fields in Persia. The discussions were still in the preliminary stage (see also Summary No. 11/44, paragraph 5). 5. Dr. Millspaugh has*issued new regulations to govern the collection of the coming harvest. The intention is to enable the Government to get hold of the whole of the surplus crop, whether belonging to landowners or peasants. The sale of wheat, barley and flour has been made a Government monopoly and any quantities offered for sale or purchased on the free market are liable to confisca tion. The price to be paid for wheat by the Government will be fixed separately in each area. Rules have been made for the methods to be employed in estimating the crop and for the assessment of the amounts that may legitimately be retained by the landlord and peasant. The whole of the difference must be sold to the (government. Government undertakes to distribute tea, sugar and cloth to [53—79] BEC8.P5L r. q i)UN “ INDIA CrHCE l2 4 4T peasants at controlled prices or, if it should fail to do so, to make a sm ab e increase in the price to be paid to the peasant for his grain. I he landowner is made responsible for delivery to Government of the whole of the surplus pi o no tion of his property, whether it be his share or the peasants . Persian Forces. A rmy. 6. It has been decided to abolish the Directorates of Cavalry and Inf anti in the Ministry for War. These directorates, which were entirely independent of the General Staff, in theory performed the duties of Inspectorates, but m practice served no useful purpose except to provide appointments without wm v or responsibility for a number of officers. These officers are now being transferred to the General Staff. The Directorates of Artillery and Engineers remain, but are deprived of their functions of inspection. 7. For purposes of conscription Persia is divided into eleven zones, eign o which correspond to the areas of the eight provincial Divisions and three are located in the area of the two Tehran Divisions. Hitherto the Conscription Offices in each zone have been under the direct control of the Director of Conscription in the Ministry for War and have been independent of the Commanders of the Divisions in whose area they are located. It has now been decided that they will be placed under their control with the exception of the offices m the three zones in the area of the Tehran Divisions. These will be under the control of the Central Recruit Training Depot in Tehran. The purpose of this change is to check the abuses and corruption that have long been prevalent m the Conscription Department. It is doubtful whether this object will be achieved. Gendarmerie. 8. Three more American officers have joined the staff of Colonel Schwarzkopf, making a total of six. No more are expected. Appointments — Military. 9. Sartip Karim Ghovanlu to be Military Governor of Tehran, vice Sartip Sheri, resigned. Internal Security. 10. Only from Khuzestan are there reports of insecurity. For some time past the Arabs have been becoming increasingly lawless and the area of the Shushtar Mianab, in particular, has been suffering from the depredations of brigands. The local Persian authorities have for long wished to carry out operations for the disarmament of the Arabs, but doubts of the ability of t e Persian forces to carry these through without provoking a disturbance that would adversely affect Allied war interests in Khuzestan have induced the British authorities to discourage such suggestions. Famine conditions resulting from the failure of the crops are likely to be an added incentive to lawlessness, and it ma&gt; become necessary to agree to a limited operation for the establishment of Persian Government authority. Russian Affairs. 11. It is reliably reported that since the middle of April numerous Soviet military survey parties have been operating in Khorassan. Nine parties have recentlv been seen in the vicinity of the Tehran-Meshed road and other parties have been seen in the vicinity of Jajarm, Bujnurd, Kashmar, Turbat-i-Haidan, Turbat-i-Jam and Khaf. . , / a 12. The strength of the Soviet garrison at Sabzawar (see Summary No. 15/44, paragraph 14) has been increased to 1,000; a platoon of infantry has been stationed at Nishapur, and a small garrison at Turbat-i-Haidarn Several new road maintenance camps have been established between Shahrud and Baigiran on the Russian frontier. Increases in the garrisons of Meshed and Quclan are also reported and an influx of Russian women and children to Meshed. The Soviet Consul-General in Khorassan, when questioned about these activities, attributed them to the development of the Shahrud-Bajgiran supply route 13. One of the papers of the Tudeh party has published an article refuting charges made against the party of being Communist in sentiment and an instrument of Russian policy. The party, it claims, is a supporter of constitu tional democratic government:' it has no desire to seize power; its mission is to organise and educate the masses so that they wif form a force ready and able todefend the Constitution if necessity should arise. If the party press .seemed partial to Russia, that was only an expression of the gratitude felt by all Persians for the genuine services Russia had rendered to Persia. The party believed in equal friendship with both Persia’s big neighbours. The Tudeh press has, however, never published any appreciation of Great Britain, nor given any indication of friendly sentiments; it has, indeed, made veiled accusations against British policy in Persia. The party, too, has since its inception included among Rs members professing Communists, and the slogans shouted by the May Day I’ocessions of the party in Meshed (see Summary No. 18/44, paragraph 3) do not show~ evidence of impartial sentiments towards Russia and Great Britain.

AS was expected, the Government survived the interpellation made by the Tudeh Deputy, larivar, on the appointment of Reza Afshar to be Governor- General of Isfahan. The ludeh Deputies and the press, with a few exceptions, expressed great indignation that an official who had been convicted of corruption should be reappointed to a Government post. As far as the Tudeh party is concerned the indignation had its origin not so much in righteousness as in the knowledge that Reza Afshar is a strong man who may deal firmly with disturbers of the peace and attempts to compel the workers to join the Tudeh party. The basis of the interpellation was that the appointment was illegal because of Afshar s conviction. The Prime Minister said that he had taken legal opinion before making the appointment and claimed that it was justified by expediency and by the results already achieved. He promised, however, to refer the question of legality to the High Court of Appeal and he was then given a vote of confidence by 73 of the 92 Deputies present. 2. The Shah returned to Tehran from his visit to Isfahan and Shiraz on the 17th May. His Majesty’s Consul in Shiraz says that his visit seems to have been welcomed by the people of Shiraz and that the enthusiasm with which he was greeted had every appearance of being genuine. The people of Shiraz are notoriously volatile, but there is among them a long-standing tradition of loyalty to the Crown and opposition to the Government and its officials. It is surmised that one of the reasons for the Shah’s journey was to demonstrate that it was not only Seyyid Zia and the Tudeh party who took an interest in the tribes. He remarked to the brothers of Nasir Qashgai that as a King he needed friends and that he hoped to find those friends in the tribes. 3. The detenus arrested at the request of the Allies in August last year have been transferred from British custody at Sultanabad to Persian custody in Tehran. Economic. 4. Recent reports from Kermanshah and Khorassan do not confirm the earlier optimistic estimates of the coming harvest. Both these provinces were relied upon to have surpluses sufficient to supply Tehran and to contribute to the deficit areas. Reports from Kermanshah in particular, which are from a reliable source, speak of disturbingly extensive failure of crops. On the other hand the Russians have now allowed it to be discovered that Azerbaijan has a surplus from the current harvest of 15,000 tons of grain. [54—21] /2 5. The town of Semnan was seriously damaged by floods resulting from ( the heavy rains of the past week. According to the press the extent of the ^ damage amounted to 20 million rials. Floods also washed out a section of the i railway between Tehran and Bandar Shahi at a point about 160 kilometres from ' g Tehran. The line was out of action for about 40 hours, but was repaired by the night of the 17th/l 8th May. Appointments — Civil. M 6. Fazlullah ITatemi to be Farmandar of Semnan. ' Persian Forces. 1 A r my. ( 7. The Minister for War has tabled three Bills. The first deals with c offences of officials engaged on recruiting. It proposes that any official who refrains from recruiting those liable to conscription or recruits those not liable t shall be condemned to from two to five years’ solitary confinement. If he accepts f bribes in any form he shall be fined five times the value of the bribe and be classed c as an armed bandit and suffer the punishment to which such criminals are liable. The second Bill forbids officers and other ranks of the army to form political parties or to take part in any political activities. The third Bill aims at speeding up the work of military courts. It proposes that in future ordinary military courts shall consist of a president and two members only and military courts of appeal of a president and five members. 8. In reply to a question in the Majlis the Minister for War stated that a sum of 51 million tomans of last year’s allotments to divisions had not yet been accounted for. In a subsequent letter to the press he modified this statement by saying'that the greater part of the amount had already been accounted for. A ppointments — Military. 9. —(i) Sarhang Najaf Quli Abbasi to be assistant to the Military Governor of Tehran. ? (ii) Sartip Mehdavi to be Director of the 'Supply Department of the Army, vice Sartip Diba, resigned. Internal Security. Fars. 10. His Majesty’s Consul in Fars reports that the atmosphere in Fars has been greatly improved by Nasir Qashgai’s visit to Shiraz to call on the Acting Governor-General and on the consul and by the surrender to the British security authorities of the absconding Deputy, Naubakht. To the consul Nasir was lavish with assurances that his only desire was to act in accordance with British wishes. It may be assumed that he qualified that statement in his own mind with the proviso that British wishes should not conflict with his own interests. For the moment those are to show what a power for order he can be in Fars, and it must be said that the migration of the Qashgai is proceeding with less than the usual lawlessness. In spite of the fact that Nasir did not come in to Shiraz during the Shah s visit, his two brothers, Muhammad Hussein and Khosrow, were treated with marked friendliness and sympathy by the Shah and accompanied him to Tehran. 11. The Khamseh tribes, bullied, neglected, hungry, ragged and leaderless, are not so orderly as the Qashgai and have been guilty of some petty robbery and brigandage. These tiibes have, in fact, suffered much more in recent years than the Qashgai and have, on the whole, behaved with restraint. 12. There has been some fighting on a small scale between the khans of Hiat Daud and those of Liravi. I athullah Khan of Hiat Daud had been deputed by the Government to collect from Liravi grain which the khans had failed to deliver to Government, and this presumably led to the hostilities. Russian A ffairs. ^ a a 5f remon y Soviet Embassy the charge d’affaires presented ntty medals to Persian motor drivers working for the Russian transport services in token of Soviet gratitude for their services. In his address the charged affaires spoke with appreciation of the services rendered by Persia to the Allies in the prosecution of the war and of the devotion to duty of most of the motor drivers employed by the Soviet authorities engaged in transporting supplies to Russia 14. In addition to the air services between Tehran and Meshed and Tehran and Tabriz, the Russians have now inaugurated a weekly service between Tehran and Pahlavi. 15. A Soviet Consulate has been opened at Kazvin, where there is already the headquarters of the Commander-in-chief of the Russian Forces in Persia. 16. It is reported, but requires confirmation, that the Russians intend to asphalt the road from Astara via Resht to Kazvin and that they have commenced work on the sector between Astara and Resht. Much propaganda is being circulated, whether by the Russians or other interested persons, about the number of Persian labourers who are to be employed at high rates of pay and the happy conditions they will enjoy. 17. A number of civilian Russians have recently arrived in Resht with their families. They are said to be men who have worked especially well in factories and to have been sent to Persia to rest as a reward. Wives and families of military personnel have also arrived in Resht Their arrival in Meshed and Tabriz has already been reported.

The future of Dr. Millspaugh and his mission has been the main topic of interest during the past week. There has been much lobbying, and the matter was discussed in one secret session of the Majlis. There is a strong feeling, even among his sympathisers, that Dr. Millspaugh has taken upon himself a /'heavier burden than he can discharge and that he should be relieved of some of his responsibilities and with them of some of the extensive authority given to him. Others think that he has proved himself to be unsuitable and that he should be replaced by another American. Others, again, wish to see the whole American mission depart. Whatever solution is found it is unlikely that the position and authority of Dr. Millspaugh will remained unaffected. 2. The case of Dr. Millspaugh has been summed up by a Deputy in a question to the Minister of Finance in the following terms (i) Far from Dr. Millspaugh having brought about a decrease in the cost of living, prices have continued to rise. When he assumed his duties with extensive powers fifteen months ago the cost of living index was 750 (as compared with 100 in 1936) whereas to-day it is 1,250. (ii) In spite of the extensive powers given to him over transport and distribution he had failed to ensure a satisfactory distribution of essential commodities, and the poor were worse off than they had been before his arrival. (iii) His only attempt to check inflation had been to encourage the purchase of foreign exchange, with the result that during the past year much capital had gone abroad. (iv) He had failed to take full advantage of the quota of imports allotted to Iran by the Allies. (v) In spite of' the fact that the harvest of the last year had been almost unprecedented in quantity the responsible organisation under his control had failed to build up any appreciable reserves of grain. (vi) He had not improved the financial situation; although capital expenditure had ceased the budget was not balanced and expenditure greatly exceeded income. (vii) He had insisted on the passing of an Income Tax Law which was not suited to the country and would result in reducing the productive power of the country, particularly in agriculture, and in a decrease of national income. (viii) In the administration of the departments under his control there were extravagance, disorder, irresponsibility and lack of attention to public duty. [54—32] RESa. n2 This is a moderate statement of the criticisms usually made of Dr. Millspaugh and his mission. A reply was given by the Minister of Finance in a secret session of the Majlis. 3. Criticism of the Prime Minister by the press is increasing. It is true that Sa’ed has few qualifications other than honesty and a fatherly manner. His ignorance of conditions in his own country, which has become a by-word, increases the indecision that naturally results from his dislike of being unpleasant to anyone. One of the Russian-inspired papers says : “ The feeble Governmen of Sa’ed is completely dominated by the dangerous schemes of the Minister of the Interior.” The Minister of the Interior, Hajher, is regarded by the Russians as being friendly to British interests. Economic. 4. In his report for the month the 22nd January to the 20th February Dr. Millspaugh notes that the loss in ten months on the commercial transactions of the Government, which include the Government factories and monopolies and the operations of the Cereals and Bread Section, amounted to 1,033,987,000 rials. The greater part of this loss was due to the difference between the price paid for grain purchased and the price received for bread sold. During the first ten months of the financial year 1943-44 the total excess of expenditure over receipts amounted to 1,242,762,000 rials. 5. Among numerous questions tabled in the Majlis during the past week are questions relating to the budget of the State Railway, where it is stated that during the past twelve months the Allies have paid to the railway the sum of 686,040,510 rials for the transport of war material; the organisation of the State Railway after the war, with particular reference to the disposal of the large number of employees who will become surplus; the provision of compensation for employees injured while working for the railway or for their dependents in the case of their death; the distribution of rationed and monopoly goods; the unsatisfactory financial condition of Government factories. 6 . Judicial Commission of Enquiry was sent to Meshed to investigate scandals in the sugar factory and in connexion with certain transactions in wheat. Their investigations have resulted in the arrest of the local Director of Finance, two other finance officials, the manager of the sugar factory and the Chief of the City Police. Internal Security. Ears. 7. It has been decided to abolish the Southern Army Headquarters, which were formed for the purpose of combining operations against the tribes of Fars of the Isfahan, Khuzestan and Fars Divisions. As there is no intention of carrying out such operations, there is no purpose in retaining the Southern Army Headquarters. General Jahanbani, who is now in Tehran, will not return to Shiraz. General Muhammad Hussein Firuz will probably go to Fars as Governor- General and Officer Commanding Troops, a position he held in 1942. He is popular with and respected by the people of Fars and is more likely to hold the balance more fairly between Qashgai and other tribes of Fars than General Jahanbani. 8 . There have recently been outbreaks in Abadan against the local Bahais, the first of which resulted in the killing of two Bahais and the burning of one of their houses. A later outbreak is reported to have been effectively dealt with by Persian troops and the ringleaders have been arrested. It is considered that these outbreaks have been instigated for some political purpose connected with the elections. Khuzestan. 9 . Operations will probably shortly be begun by the Persian army in the Shushtar-Mianab area for the punishment and disarmament of brigand bands and the recovery of property looted by them. 10. It is reported that the sheikhs of the Beni Ka’ab, of the Muhaisin and of the Beni Turuf have entered into an agreement for mutual aid and co-opera tion in resisting demands by the Government in matters of conscription and of the collection of the coming harvest. His Majesty’s Consul at Khorramshahr reports that this alleged agreement is arousing considerable interest among the sheikhs of other Arab tribes.3 Ml Bakhtiari. cpKiplaints have recently reached Tehran against the administra tion ot Morteza Quh Khan, the Governor of Bakhtiari. While there is probably some ground for these complaints, Morteza Quli being a Persian tribal chief, t lere is no doubt that they have been greatly exaggerated, and that the agitation is being encouraged by almost all the other Bakhtiari khans, who are annoyed ggiith Morteza Quli Khan for various personal reasons, and may even attempt to ^Hstigate disturbances in Bakhtiari to discredit him. The probability of this is not legai'ded as serious at present, the agitation, however, shows how wise Keza Shah was to remove all important tribal khans from their tribes and even, sometimes, from this world. Russian Affairs. 12. M. Maximoff, until recently counsellor of the Soviet Embassy, has been appointed ambassador. Previous to coming to Tehran as counsellor he had been Soviet Consul-General in Meshed. 13. In Summary No. 16/44, paragraph 12 , it was reported that there were signs of an intention on the part of the Soviet authorities to. increase their influence in Persian Azarbaijan. The staff of the Soviet Consulate have recently been provocatively interfering in internal affairs, big and small, even when they were no concern of theirs. This, however, may be more the personal policy of the acting consul-general, Marchenko, than a policy dictated 'from above. His annoyance at the difficulty he had experienced in securing the election for Tabriz of even two of the Russian favourites was increased by subsequent pretests made to the Supervising Committee against their election, and by the committee’s decision to refuse to issue their credentials but to refer the matter to Tehran. He threatened the Governor that, if the Supervising Committee did not cease its hostility to the Russians, Azarbaijan as a whole would pay. The kurds could pillage and the mob could riot for all the Russians would care. Much propaganda is being made in favour of Soviet culture and Soviet systems. The reappearance of the paper Vatan Yolinda, printed in Turki at the Russian military press in Tabriz, was mentioned in Summary No. 16/44. It has recently contained several articles extolling the benefits that have come to Russian Azarbaijan from the Communist regime. Examples are appended to this summary. The Russian hospital, which is to accept local civilians, is nearly ready for opening, and search is still being made for a suitable building for the Russian school, which, while its main purpose is officially said to be the^education of Russian children in Tabriz, is also to accept local children. American Affairs. 14. One of the Deputies has given notice of a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointing out that the presence of British and Russian troops in Persia is governed by a treaty approved by the Majlis and asking by virtue of what law are American troops stationed in Persia. This question has been raised several times in press and Parliament since the arrival of American troops. 15. Between the 5th and 13th May two contingents of American technical troops, each of about 200, passed through Tabriz on their way to Russia. 16. Mr. Timmerman, American adviser to the Persian police, died suddenly on the 20 th May. British Affairs. 17. Four Indian members of the Viceroy’s Defence Committee visited Tehran during the past week.

The ‘lYth Anniversary of Soviet Government in Azarbaijan. pe The Azarbaijanis and of what they can boast. During the last twenty-four years of Soviet Government, under the brilliant policy of the Bolshevik party, there has been great progress in arts, education, distribution of land and food, and many people have been trained for Government ppsts and defence work. Before the revolution there were few engineers, doctors and teachers in Azarbaijan but now there are thousands of them. To-day Azarbaijan may boast of its numerous doctors, engineers, generals, officers, artists, teachers, writers, painters, specialists and the brave young men who have been decorated for their valour. There are also many well-known Azerbaijanis outside Azarbaijan. Besides this many Azarbaijanis are working in commissaries and other organisa tions outside the republic, and in order to help the war effort many engineers, workers, mechanics, &amp;c., are toiling in the oilfields. Vatan Yolinda ” No. 8 , dated 2f$th April, 1944. Azarbaijan during the last 24 years under Soviet Government. Azarbaijan is a country of civilisation and education. It has made great progress in these during the last twenty-four years under Soviet Government. The national policy of bolshevism has changed Azarbaijan from an illiterate country to an educated one. The April revolution greatly benefitted the Azarbaijanis, who now possess schools and fine arts which they had not known in the past. With the first years of revolution schools were established in every part of the country and the children of workers and labourers who in the past had been deprived of education were now educated free of charge. In 1914 there were 73,000 students, by 1940 the number had risen to 717,000. During the Soviet regime the number of schools has increased year by year so that between 1920 and 1939, 837 schools have been established. One of the greatest benefits the revolution has brought is the high schools, which now produce doctors, engineers, specialists, &amp;c. Before the revolu tion there were only five-six papers being published, now there are are sixty. Before the revolution very little was known of opera, now we have many like Kor Oghli, Shah Ismael Markis and many others. “ Vatan Yolinda” No. 9, dated 2%th April, 1944. The Result of the War forEreedom. Azarbaijan did not gain Soviet Government, national freedom and a progressive life without any trouble, for during the past thousand years, as history will show, they have fought against usurpers, cruel men, and lately against the Czarist Government. They have gained it through the devotion of great men. Stalin, who is the founder of bolshevism in the Caucasus, came to Baku in 1904 and started to lead the people against the Czarist Government in order to create freedom In 1918 the Baku Labour party organised Soviet Government at Baku and proclaimed communism, which did great things in Baku for some months. But it did not live very long because Soviet Government was abolished through the treachery of Musawat party, Dashnagsagan party and Mensheviks, and the leaders of communism such as Azizbegoff Shaumian, Chaparidz and some twenty-six others were killed. Kazi Mahamad, Binyad Sardaroff, Bala Amu Dadashoff, Amir Aslanoff, Mugtadi Aydinbegoff and Ali Beyramoff were shot for being Liberals. This kind of treatment, however, created such anger among the people that instead of discouraging them they were stimulated, to fight for the Soviet Government. At last in 1920 on the 28th April, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, Azarbaijanis, with the help of the Red Army, overthrew Mosavatist capitalists and hoisted the flag of freedom.\T' K THIS DOCUMENT IS T as PERSIA.

Tehran, bth June, 1944. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 22 for the Period 2$tth May-Ath June, 1944. (Secret.) Political. Persian Affairs. NO solution has yet been found to the dispute between Dr. Millspaugh and the Deputies. A proposal that he should surrender some of his powers to a Ministry of Economy was rejected by Dr. Millspaugh on the grounds that economic work was too closely associated with finance to allow of their separation, and he flatly refused to accept any reduction of his powers. In a confidential letter to the Government he answers some of the criticisms of his work. He points out that the rate of increase in the cost of living has notably slowed down since his arrival. He. claims that, in grain collection, bread distribution and the procurement and distribution of monopoly goods, organisation and a settled policy have replaced confusion. The plans for the distribution of monopoly goods were only completed three months ago and were now in operation. The customs ware houses, once clogged with goods, were now clear. Monopoly goods were being moved in increasing quantities and were being distributed to people—villagers and tribesmen—who had never previously received such goods. Energetic steps were being taken in conjunction with M.E.S.C. to ensure that supplies will be ample for distribution to all. 2 . The news that a letter had been addressed by the American Government to the Persian Government on the subject of Dr. Millspaugh’s mission leaked out to the press and the public. It was represented as being a warning that the American Government would regard further criticism or opposition to the American advisers as unfriendliness to the American Government. The press worked up some indignation over this imagined interference in the internal affairs of Persia and protested against what was purely an internal matter being brought into the field of international relations. The text of the letter has not been published. It is known that its sense was not as originally represented by the Persian press, but was rather an expression of regret that the Persian Govern ment had not defended more convincingly the American officials in their service. That the question of Dr. Millspaugh’s powers is a matter for Persia alone to decide and is not a matter in which any foreign Power can properly intervene has been insisted on in the press and the Majlis. 3. The Cabinet is not happy. The Shah is reported to be discontented with the Prime Minister, presumably because he is unwilling or unable to bring about the results desired by the Shah. The latter is said to be looking about for a successor and to be considering Qavam-es-Sultaneh and Hajhir, the present Minister of the Interior. The latter has probably too pro-British a colour to be acceptable to the Russians. His relations with the Prime Minister are now rather strained, and this is attributed to the latter’s suspicions that Hajhir aspires to his place. [54—34] &lt;^5&gt; 9 o2 C 4. For some time past tension has been evident between Moslems and Bahais, and this resulted in demonstrations hostile to the Bahais at Senandaj, Hamadan and Abadeh, as reported in Summary No. 21 , paragraph 8 . This tension may be used, as it was at Abadeh, to provoke disturbances for political reasons. There has, in fact, been some increased missionary activity on the part of Bahais of late to celebrate the opening of the second century of the Bahai faith, and, although no evidence is as yet available that there has been any notable increase in convert the greater freedom enjoyed by the Bahais to speak of their faith has probably frightened the Mullahs, since Islam is a weakening if not dying faith, whose place might well be taken by Bahaism. Bahaism, with its vague but kindly philosophy, is agreeable to Persian mentality, and the community has a tradition, resulting perhaps from years of Oppression, of solidarity and co-operation among themselves, which contrasts with usual Persian characteristics. Economic. 5. Dr. Millspaugh has published a statement to the effect that the total amount of grain collected by the Government since September 1943 is 346,278 tons and that stocks in Tehran on the 19th May were 31,510 tons. This he considers to be adequate assurance of the needs of the country until next harvest. 6 . The instruments of ratification of the commercial agreement between Persia and the United States, which was signed in April 1943, were exchanged at Washington on the 31st May. The agreement comes into force thirty days after that date. The text is not yet available, but it is understood that it does not give discriminatory treatment in favour of the United States. Among Persian exports to America will be handicraft products, gum and opium, and American imports to Persia will include motor vehicles, tyres, machinery, lubricants. 7. As has already been reported, when the Soviet authorities forced the Persian Government to make a contract for the manufacture and supply to Russia of rifles, automatic pistols and ammunition the question of payment was left unsettled. The Russians have as yet paid nothing and the cost of operating the factories has been a very heavy drain on the funds of the Persian Government. The Prime Minister has stated that he has now some hope that the Russians will pay at the rate of 1,000 rials per rifle and 3 rials per round of ammunition. Appointments — Civil. 8 . Sarlashkar Muhammad Hussein Firuz to be Governor-General of Fars. Persian Forces. 9. In an interview given to the editor of the Ra'di Imruz, a paper closely connected with Seyyid Zia, Dr. Millspaugh gave the following figures for the budgets of the Persian forces for the past year :— Rials. Army 1,000,000,000 Gendarmerie 298,246,100 Police force 187,000,000 1,485,246,100 He would allot the same gross total for these forces this year, and no more. It was for the Government to decide how it should be distributed among them; which force should be decreased and which, if any, increased. He expressed the opinion that in their present form these forces were superfluous and not worth the money spent on them. Whatever truth there may be in this, it is not encouraging to the American advisers who have been working with these forces for more than a year. The cost of the army considered necessary by General Ridley is about 1,500 million rials, and of the gendarmerie recommended by Colonel Schwarzkopf 600 million rials. A ppointments — Military. 10. Sarlashkar Muhammad Hussein Firuz to command the 6 th (Fars) Division. Russian Affairs. 11. A party of Russians with a Russian military escort recently visited Bushire. They said they were accompanying a member of the Russian Trade Delegation in Tehran who was enquiring into the possibility of purchasing3 c opium. They gave exhibitions in Bushire of posters and photographs, not - concerned with opium, which they had brought with them: Another party, including two military officers, recently visited the Georgian villages of Feraidan district in the Isfahan Province. These Georgians were brought from the Caucasus by Shah Abbas. It has inevitably been said that the purpose of this visit, as it may well have been, was to make contact with Persian minorities of j^licasian origin. The Armenians of Julfa, near Isfahan, also come in for Ivussian attentions. Three hundred of their children under 16 are now learning Russian from teachers specially brought by the Russians for the purpose. 12 . The Irano-Soviet Cultural Society (see Summaries Nos. 9/44, para graph 18, and 6/44, paragraph 20 ), which now calls itself the Iranian Society for Cultural Relations with the Soviet Union, has now published its statutes contained in twenty-five articles. The second article sets out the main objects of the society under eighteen headings, which are mainly concerned with methods of making known the literature, art, drama, music, science, educational methods of one country to the other. It is clear that in practice the society will be used to make Soviet culture known to Persia and to spread Soviet ideas rather than to make Persian culture known to Russia. Ordinary members, who pay 3,500 rials a year as subscription, must be Persians, but Soviet citizens may be admitted as honorary members. A member of V.O.K.S. (Society for Cultural Relationships between the Soviet Union and Foreign Countries) must be a member of the committee. Branches may be opened in the provinces. 13. Questions have been asked in the Majlis by one of the Azerbaijan Deputies whose election was opposed by the Russians why the “Allies ” were preventing the export from Azerbaijan of the dried fruit crop and other products. They had put Azerbaijan into a state of siege and the Governor-General was without authority. 14. The Soviet authorities have given contracts for the asphalting of the road from Astara via Resht to Kazvin and for some masonry bridges on the section between Astara and Resht. The rates they have accepted are higher than those normally paid by the British authorities. The specification they have laid down is for a more enduring type of surfacing than has been used by the British authorities, and it seems that they have some longer-term object in view than their war-time needs, for which, indeed, the construction of the road seems to come rather late in the day. 15. It has now been ascertained that among the conditions attaching to Stalin’s offer of tanks and aircraft to the Shah (see Summary No. 48/43, para graph 8 ), which included the formation of regiments of mixed Russian and Persian personnel, were the following :— The commander of the regiment was to be a Russian officer. The Persian personnel were to be selected with the approval of the Russian commander. The Soviet Government would pay the Russian personnel. The regiments were to be under the command of the Red Army. The regiments oould not be moved from their appointed places of training—Meshed and Kazvin—nor could the material be diverted to any other purpose, without the approval of the Red Army. Corrigendum.

IHh Court of Cassation came to a decision with unusual promptness in the case of Reza Afshar, the Governor-General of Isfahan, whose appointment had been the cause of an interpellation of the Government—see Summary No. 20 , 1944, paragraph 1 . The decision was that his previous conviction debarred him from being appointed to a Government post. He will now be recalled from Isfahan. 2 . Certain of the Deputies from Azerbaijan, not including any of those favoured by the Russians, have combined with the Democrat group of Deputies to form a new group called Liberty, which will now have a membership of about thirty. Economic. 3. The sugar ration, in theory available at controlled prices, is to be increased from 400 to 500 grammes per head per month. Persian Forces. 4. The statements made by Dr. Millspaugh in his interview to the press— see Summary No. 22, 1944, paragraph 9—called forth a reply from the Minister of War, which was also published in the press. The Minister pertinently asks what justification had Dr. Millspaugh, an employee of the Persian Government, for discussing in the press the affairs of the army and gendarmerie, and for creating public anxiety by his criticisms. The Government was well aware of the need for army reform, but would it not have been better if Dr. Millspaugh had consulted General Ridley before making his strictures. He had said that the army was unnecessary and that the money spent on it could more usefully be used for agriculture, education and hygiene. That was a matter for the' Persian Government to decide, but did Dr. Millspaugh think that anything could be done unless the army established and maintained security? Would not Millspaugh do better to look to his own departments? The Price Stabilisation section alone cost millions of rials and had done nothing to reduce prices. The high cost of the army was entirely due to the bad administration of the country's finances and economy. 5. A Cabinet meeting has been held to consider the budgets of the army, the gendarmerie and the police. In addition to the Ministers it was attended by the Chief of Staff, General Ridley, Colonel Schwarzkopf and Dr. Millspaugh. General Ridley and Colonel Schwarzkopf justified the budgets they had prepared. Dr. Millspaugh said he had calculated the maximum revenue of the countrv for [54—56] KCd. K&gt;L. MPT. JL INDIA OFFICE2 the current year at approximately 4,000 million rials, and that he could not consider allotting to the three security forces more than 40 per cent, of the total revenue—between 1,500 and 1,600 million rials. He left it to the Government to decide how the amount should be distributed between the three forces. The budget for the army amounts to over 1,500 million rials for 90,000 men, of the gendarmerie to 600 million rials for 28,000 men, and of the police for 10,000 men to 300 million rials. Dr. Millspaugh suggested that they should each ha\^^ approximately the amount allotted last year, that is 1,000 million for the arndli^ 300 million for the gendarmerie and 200 million for the police. This would entail the reduction of the army to 60,000 men and of the gendarmerie to 14,000 men. 6 . The Persian Government has been informed that fifteen Anson aircraft, which are being provided by His Majesty’s Government in replacement of Mohawk aircraft taken over by the Royal Air Force in 1941, will shortly be available in Mideast for delivery to the Persian Air Force. Three Dominie aircraft will also shortly be delivered for the Persian Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. A pjioin t m ents—M Hi tary. 7.

When in October last (see Summary No. 13, 1944, paragraph 11 ) operations against the Buchakchi tribe of the Sirjan district resulted in the surrender of old Hussein Khan and later of his son, Akbar Khan Shiyapur, the other Buchakchi brigand, Murad Ali Murad, remained at large with a band of followers. Operations are now being carried out by two battalions of the 7th (Kerman) Division to round these up. Fars. 9. A small operation was successfully carried out against the Khans of Liravi (north of Bushire on the Gulf Coast) for the purpose of obliging these khans to surrender grain they had undertaken to supply—see Summary No. 20, 1944, paragraph 12. A column, 180 strong, from Shiraz occupied Hisar (half way between Ganaveh and Bandar Dilam), whereupon the principal Liravi Khan, Muhammad Ali, fled. The grain is being transported to Bushire and the column is being withdrawn. Bakhtiari. 10 . A number of Bakhtiaris gathered in the village of Buldaji for the alleged purpose of making a concerted complaint against Morteza Quli Khan, the Governor of Bakhtiari. There is little doubt that they were instigated by the other senior khans, who are working up opposition to Morteza Quli—see Summary No. 21, 1944, paragraph 11 —and it was suspected that the real purpose of the gathering was to organise restistance. Consequently, a battalion of troops from Isfahan rounded up the village. The dissident khans, who included some of the minor khans who had supported Abul Qasim in his brief career as a rebel, surrendered without opposition and were taken to Isfahan. Some thirty rifles were recovered, of which fifteen were Brno rifles which had been captured from Government forces. 11. It is intended shortly to initiate operations for the disarmament of certain sections of the Chahar Lang Memivand Bakhtiari in the area north-west of Faridan, including the Fuladvand, the Zillaki, the Hividi, who are believed to have been responsible for the murder of Mr. Harris—see Summary No. 32, 1942, i KHo'r3 paragraph 11 —and the retainers of Khajeh Mehdi Quli Moghui. A column of a squadron of cavalry and two companies of infantry will operate from Ali Gudar and two battalions of the Isfahan Division from Faridan. X koraSa Russian A (fairs. At 12 . His Majesty’s Consul-General in Tabriz reports that there is now ^apparently a clear policy of posting Moslems from Soviet Azerbaijan to both civil and military posts in Persian Azerbaijan. Most military officers in Tabriz are now of that category, and a Moslim Vice-Consul has been posted to the Soviet Consulate-General. The Soviet Azerbaijanis, like Soviet Armenians, are the most fervent propagators of the expansion of Russian influence. 13. The operations of the Russian survey parties, which were reported in Summary No. 19, 1944, paragraph 11 , have now extended to the Kal i shur River (between Turbat i Haidan and Juimand) and to the hills south-west of Khaf (I.41.G (1941)-N.1379). It is reported that geological survey, with a view to the location of oil, forms part of the work of these survey parties. 14. A certain Sheikh Hussein Lenkorani is standing for election for the constituency of Ardebil in Eastern Azerbaijan. He is a notorious intriguer, agitator and mob orator frequently used by the Shah to work up disturbances and demonstrations, and recently particularly to fan the agitation against Seyyid Zia. It is noteworthy that his candidature is supported not only by the Shah, but strongly by the Russians. 15. An extra assistant military attache, Lieutenant-Colonel Ivanov, has arrived to join the staff of the Soviet Military Attache. 16. The Russians persist in their refusal to allow the Persian Government to locate a regiment of infantry in the Mahabad district of Azerbaijan, as they have long wished to do, although they are willing to agree to a maximum of a battalion of 300. Yugoslav Affairs. 17. A certain Colonel Mistrovitch is now in Tehran recruiting for Marshal Tito among Yugoslavs resident in Persia. He works in the Soviet Consulate and has so far recruited some fifty-sixty men, whom he is to take to Russia. Colonel Lozitch, who was Yugoslav Military Attache in Moscow until he declared for Tito, is also here, accompanied by a youth whom he introduced as Tito’s son. A merican A (fairs. 18. A Deputy, Dr. Shafaq, spoke at some length in the Majlis in eulogy of America, Americans and American services to Persia. This had presumably the object of allaying the irritation that might reasonably be expected to have been caused to the American Embassy and the American Government by the scandalous attacks on the American advisers. Among the reasons for which Persia would be eternally grateful to America, he said, were the services of American educationalists and of Morgan Shuster and Dr. Millspaugh during his previous engagement with the Persian Government, and American support of Persia at the Peace Conference after the last war.

THE Prime Minister, asked in the Majlis whether he had yet come to a decision regarding the future of Dr. Millspaugh, replied that he hoped to bring about amicably a change in the methods and in the financial and economic policy of Dr. Millspaugh that would be more suitable to the needs of the country and the wishes of the people. The Government accepted full responsibility, and the Majlis could rest assured that they would maintain direct and full control over the finance and economy of the country without delegating any of their responsi bility to foreign advisers. While appreciative of the services of the American advisers, the Government was also aware of their shortcomings. Employees of the Government, whether Persian or foreign, who failed to give satisfactory service would be dismissed. 2. Three months of the current financial year have passed without the budget having been presented to the Majlis. Ail administrations are short of funds for the payment of salaries and current expenses. The Deputies are beginning to show impatience at the delay in presenting the budget. Economic. 3.

The police and the gendarmerie, even if they had had the goodwill, lacked the numbers and the mobility to give any effective protection, so responsibility for certain defined^ lengths of the line has now been assumed by the Persian army. American Affairs. 7. A Bill has been passed by the Majlis with double urgency authorising the transfer to the American Embassy in Tehran of the ownership of 22,000 square metres of land in the vicinity of the American camp near Tehran, to be used as a cemetery.

MiIi&amp;kwJ? beg N U) 'rc&amp;L&gt;rne vvo Dr. MILLSPAUGH and all the members of his mission have resigned. This followed on the presentation by the Government to members of the Majlis for discussion the draft of a Bill cancelling the law of the 3rd April, 1943, from which Dr. Millspaugh derived his autocratic powers. In his letter of resignation he accuses the Government of having failed to carry out their obligations under that law, of having withheld assistance and support from the American mission, of having encouraged those elements who desired to destroy the mission or to prevent it from working effectively, and of being unwilling even to consider the evidence that could be produced of the good progress made by the mission. From their previous conversations with Dr. Millspaugh the Government must have realised that their proposed Bill would result in his resignation, but it seems that they are trying to persuade him and other American advisers to stay on. 2. Dr. Millspaugh’s resignation takes effect from the 29th June. It is unlikely that the Persian Government have any plans for the operation of the various organisations and administrations now in charge of the American advisers, of whom there are now thirty-nine. Since objections to Dr. Millspaugh’s plans for the collection of cereals, the distribution of monopoly goods and the levying of taxation was the cause of the agitation for the abolition of his powers \ it is presumably intended to modify his policy in some respects. This will almost certainly lead to great dislocation in the finance and economy of the country, to inevitable delay in the improvement of the economic situation, if not to definite retrogression. His resignation has been greeted with rejoicing by all corrupt elements in the country. 3. A party calling itself Mehan has been formed bv the already existing parties Peikar, Istiqal, Mehan Parastan and Azadikhahan. These are composed mostly of young men with strongly nationalistic and xenophobic views, whose policy is claimed to be pro-Persian and neither pro-British nor pro-Russian. The new party is believed to have the support of the Shah. It has no representation in the Majlis. Other attempts are being made to form parties to oppose the allegedly pro-British Seyyid Zia, on the one hand, and the pro-Russian Tudeh party, on the other. 4. Seyyid Abul Qasem Kashani, a well-known mullah who is deeply impli cated in German plots in Persia and who has been evading arrest since last August, was run to ground by the British security authorities an&lt;j is now in British custody. An attempt was made to persuade shopkeepers in Tehran to close their shops as a protest against the arrest by foreigners of a prominent priest and a question was asked in the Majlis, but on the whole the arrest has been taken calmly. . [55—25] POL. DiPr, B jul r • &gt;IA OFFICE5. A new paper, Darya, has appeared, the tone of whose articles is indis tinguishable from pre-war Russian revolutionary propaganda. It is frankly pro-Russian, communistic and revolutionary. It preaches class war; the bour geoisie must first be made to fight the capitalists so that the proletariat can finally triumph over both. Great Britain and America are mentioned as capitalist nations. It refers to alleged British support of pan-Arabism, with specia^^ reference to Khuzestan, and stresses the danger this is to Persia. It prinf^* extracts from Karl Marx’s British Rule in India. 6 . A reception was held at the Municipality on the 22 nd June to celebrate the re-naming of three streets in Tehran, which are in the vicinity of the embassies concerned, as Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt Avenues. This is to commemorate the Tehran Conference. Economic. 7. The budget for the current year—the 21 st March, 1944, to the 20 th March, 1945—was presented to the Majlis on the 18th June. General revenue is estimated at 3,957,619,660 rials and general expenditure at 4.569.482,444 rials, showing a deficit of 611,862,284 rials. Commercial and industrial revenue is estimated at 6,367,182.450 rials and expenditure at 5,754,849.275 rials, giving a surplus of 613,333,175 rials. The amounts demanded by the Ministries concerned for the security forces are :— Million rials.

The Bahmai tribe of Kuhgalu have been guilty of a few minor raids in the vicinity of Masjid-i-Suleiman. An abortive attempt to disarm this tribe was made in April 1944—see Summary No. 14/44, paragraph 10—as it was expected that sooner or later they would be unable to refrain from lawlessness. Russian Affairs. 11 The Russians have succeeded in frightening away all candidates for the Ardebil elections except their own choice, Sheikh Hussein Lenkorani—see Summary No. 23/44, paragraph 14-—so that there appears to be no doubt of his election in spite of the fact that he has no connexion whatever with Ardebil. The Russians presumably intend to use him for their campaign against Seyyid Zia. The Soviet Consul-General in Tabriz recently asked for the expulsion from Tabriz of a minor Persian official who had dared to send a telegram of congratula tion to Seyyid Zia and, the Governor-General having refused to comply with this request, the offending official is now being subjected to the abuse and threats of Soviet hirelings. 12 . At the request of the Soviet Consul-General in Tabriz the Governor- General of Azerbaijan has published a notice to the effect that the Soviet authorities had complained that Persians were purchasing arms from Russian troops and warning the people that anyone found in possession of Russian arms would be severely punished.

Tehran, 3rd July, 1944. 125 Enclosure. (Secret.) Military A ttache’s Intelligence Summary No. 26 for the Period 26£A June-^nd July, 1944. Persian Affairs. Political. ■THE Government refused to accept Dr. Millspaugh’s resignation and requested him to stay on for the purpose for which he was originally engaged, that is, as Financial Adviser. The Deputies, of whom a majority, inspired by profiteers, or the Tudeh, or the Shah, or the Russians, were originally opposed to Dr. Millspaugh even to the extent of being prepared to face his departure, have on reflection become frightened of the possible effect it might have on Perso- American relations and on Lease-Lend supplies, and an increasing number are veering round in favour of his retention. Dr. Millspaugh has reiterated his refusal to accept any limitation of his powers, but he has made some conciliatory proposals, £nd the Government is showing some signs of wavering and of lacking the courage to face the consequences of the departure of the American Mission. This question has absorbed the attention of press and Parliament during the past week. It is generally considered that, if Dr. Millspaugh stays on his own terms. Sa’ed’s Government will have to go. The uncertainty has, as usual, paralysed the administration. Ministers are unwilling to give decisions on any matter. It is understood that the final decision of the Government is to be announced on the 3rd July. Meanwhile, Dr. Millspaugh and his mission have continued at their duties. 2. In Isfahan the Tudeh and the Vatan parties (the latter is alleged to be inspired by Seyyid Zia) are struggling hard with each other for control of the mill-workers and for political influence in Isfahan. The Tudeh party is reliably reported to be losing ground, and the Vatan party, which is supported by milf- and landowners because it is opposed to the Tudeh, if for no other reason, to be gaining adherents. The struggle between the two parties may lead to disturbances in Isfahan. 3. The paper Darya, of which mention was made in Summary No. 4.2/25. paragraph 5, has in recent issues drawn attention to alleged Turkish plans for the disintegration of Persia by the improper interest Turkish officials have been showing in minorities in Persia of Turki stock and by the renewal of their “ revisionist claims.” Reference is probably intended to the foolish championing of the Qashgai tribes by the Turkish Ambassador at the time the Persian army were carrying out operations' against them and by the even more foolish suggestion he made to the Qashgai chiei’s that they should migrate to a welcoming Turkey. Revolutionary propaganda continues. The proletariat should do all it can to weaken the Government; the weaker the Government, the greater the opportunity for the proletariat. At all costs, the bourgeoisie, the capitalists and the head of the State must be prevented from uniting. Mr. Churchill had saidrs that fascism would not be allowed in the ‘‘conquered” countries, which presumably meant that the British Government would have no objection to its establishment in other countries. It might suit the ‘ ‘ capitalist ’ countries (Great Britain had already been included in this category) to strengthen fascism in countries adjacent to Soviet Russia. Perhaps that was why men “ with^ twenty years’ training ” were being sent to countries of the Middle East. (The^ reference is clearly to Seyyid Zia.) The Comintern had been abolished, but, after the war the occupying armies of the Allies were to be used to suppress sociaAlff revolutions or communism, Russia would not co-operate. ” If Russia could not help the Communists, she would refrain from using arms against them.” Fars. Internal Security. 4. A reconciliation has recently been made between the Qavam-ul-Mulk on the one hand and Nasir Qashgai and his brothers on the other, and they have agreed to co-operate in the interests of Fars rather than to oppose each other. As conditions of his co-operation, the Qavam has stipulated that no action shall be taken against the interests of the Persian Government or against the interests or wishes of the British Government. The Qashgai brothers have agreed to these conditions. The reconciliation has the approval of the Governor-General-elect of Fars, General Firuz, and it should improve for the time being the situation in Fars. The motive that has induced the Qavam-ul-Mulk to respond to the advances of the Qashgai brothers was the conviction that the Government would do nothing to protect such interests as are left to him and his family in Fars against the Qashgai. The motive that inspired Nasir Qashgai may have been nothing more than to prove his friendship for the British by becoming friends with their friend and his former enemy. He will break any engagements into which he has entered when it suits him. Khuzestan. 5. Operations are now in progress in the Ahu Dasht area of Northern Khuzestan for the suppression of bands of Arab brigands who have been a nuisance in that area (see Summary No. 21/44, paragraph 9). Sections of the Chaab, of the Abdulkhani and the Beni Tamim resisted the Persian troops, and punitive air operations were carried out, which are said to have resulted in the death of sixty to eighty Arabs. The surrender of all arms in the area has been demanded by the Persian Commander and the submission of the sheikhs. The Persian authorities report that 100 arms have been handed in and that some, but not all, of the sheikhs have submitted. Kerman. 6 . The roads in the Kerman Province have been unsafe of late, particularly the road Kerman-Bam-Zahidan and the road Kerman-Sirjan-Bandar Abbas, on both of which travellers have been held up by armed brigands and robbed. The robbers are said to be Baluchi tribesmen who have enlisted in the gendarmerie and supplement their meagre pay by highway robbery. Belgian Affairs. 7. The Belgian Military Attache has been given a Persian decoration for having lectured at the Persian Staff College. Tehran, 2nd July, 1944. yi* ■ A. &amp; i (A .

(Secret.) V Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 27 for the Period ?&gt;rd to §th July, 1944. Political. Persian Affairs. IN spite of the Prime Minister’s insistence that the powers of Dr. Millspaugh must be modified in such a manner as to recognise the full responsibility of the Government for the financial and economic affairs of the country, and in spite of the fact that he originally had the support of a majority of the Deputies for this attitude, in the end it was agreed that Dr. Millspaugh should carry on for an undefined period of &lt;c three or four ” months with undiminished powers. At the end of that period the matter should again be reviewed. Dr. Millspaugh has agreed that he will consult the Minister of Finance on important financial matters and before issuing regulations, and will keep him informed of the course of affairs so that he can reply to questions in the Majlis; that he will collaborate with the Prime Minister in the formation of a committee, which would include a Cabinet Minister, to conduct negotiations • with the Allied authorities concerning current problems connected with import quotas, navigation, transport and the feeding of the country; that he will appoint two Deputies to himself from among the American advisers, one of whom would be concerned solely with finance, the other with economic questions, with a view to accelerating decisions. The Prime Minister, in accepting the arrangement, points out, however, that it does not accord with the view of the Government and the Majlis that the Minister of Finance should control the economic and financial affairs of the country. 2. The conversion of the Deputies to support of the retention of Dr. Millspaugh on his own terms was due in part to the fear that assailed them on considering the possible economic calamities that might follow on the departure of the American mission and in part to the knowledge that his departure was ardently desired by the Russians and the Shah. That considera tion alone was sufficient to dispose a number of Deputies in his favour. The annoyance of the Russians at his retention has been clearly shown in the Tudeh press, and Dr. Musaddiq, one of the Shah’s spokesmen on these matters in the Majlis, has attacked the Government for yielding, and has argued that Dr. Millspaugh’s powers are incompatible with the Constitution, since the Minister of Finance is deprived of all responsibility and is reduced to the position of an adviser. 3. Saed’s Government may not fall immediately, but by having had to abandon the position he had apparently firmly taken up as regards the abroga tion of Dr. Millspaugh’s powers, he has lost much ground. The Cabinet was divided on the question, and that is likely to increase already existing dissensions. The Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Deputies/especially Seyyid Zia, who played an important part in turning Majlis opinion against forcing Dr. Millspaugh’s resignation, will all have earned the displeasure of the Shah.4. The paper Daria, to which reference has been made in Summary No. 26/44, paragraph 3, and which is strongly suspected of being subsidised by the Russians, accuses Dr. Millspaugh of being an agent of the American Govern ment, a kind of American High Commissioner ruling and exploiting Persia in the interests of the United States. The intervention of the American Government, it says, had frightened the Deputies from their original intention. What would happen if Persia’s two neighbours were to follow America’s example and, taking advantage of the weakness of the Majlis, treat Persia as if she were their colony? 5. Under the auspices of the Tudeh party there has been formed a “ Central Council of Iranian Workers’ and Toilers’ Unions,” to which it is hoped to affiliate all existing Labour unions. Its official organ is the newspaper Zafar, printed at the Tudeh press. It urges the necessity for all workers to enter the field of politics and to unite, for only in unity will they find the strength to fight the reactionaries.

(iv) Sarhang Sayyid Hussein Hashimi, to command the 9 th (Ardebil) Brigade. Internal Security. Bakhtiari. 8 . Mortesa Quli Khan, Governor of Bakhtiari, has now reached Tehran to answer to the Government for the many complaints that have been made against him, and to endeavour to come to terms with all the other Khans who have been agitating against him because they have not been allowed to extract from Bakhtiari the share of the pickings which they had hoped for on the appointment of one of themselves as Governor of the tribe. A number of petty khans with complaints against Morteza Quli have also reached Tehran. That- some of these complaints are justified there is little doubt, but it will be regrettable if Morteza Quli Khan is removed from the Governorship as, whatever just causes of complaint there may be against him, he probably maintains better order than anyone else is likely to do. 9. Troops have moved out from Isfahan for the disarmament of certain small outlying sections of the Chahar Lang Bakhtiari—see Summary No. 23 /44 paragraph 11 . From such reports as have been received of the operations hitherto it seems that the commander of the troops—General Qadar—is now waitino- to see what offers are made by the tribes concerned to buy him off. Pars. 10 . Reports from Fars say that Nazir Qashgai is becoming doubtful of his chances of maintaining the position, which he likes to think he holds, of para mount influence in Fars. Haying failed to get elected for Shiras, he hesitates now to stand for election for either of the vacant seats of Firuzabad or Abadeh being fearful lest the great tribal leader should come to be regarded as a mere deputy. He is suspicious, too, of his two brothers, Muhammad Hussein and Khusrow, who, spending much of their time in Tehran, have made manv contacts and are already on apparently good terms with Qawam ul Mulk and the Governor-General elect, General Firuz. However much contempt the tribesmen may express for Tehran and the Government, there is still a tendency to attach some importance to what Tehran is saying, and Nazir does not know while his brothers do. He recently attempted to intervene in the dispute between Morteza Quli Khan and the other Bakhtiari Khans, to meet with a rebuff He has also been trying to rent the lands of the Dushmanziari tribe with a view to increasing the sphere of his influence. This has aroused protests from the Dushmanzian chiefs who have no desire to have a Qashgai overlord.Russian Affairs. ^nmn^rn^T 16 a Soviet Consulate at Kazvin was reported in Kabul ' °’ ' P ara S ra ph lb. A consular agency has now been opened at V2 f w A , memb A er P r - M . ill spaugh’s mission has recently made an extended *)ur of Western Azerbaijan, investigating the harvest. He was born in Kezzieh and knows well the ocal people. He has returned convinced that in Western Azerbaijan the Tudeh party is definitely working for the separation of Azerbaijan from 1 ersia. The Armenians, he considers, are the driving force. He could not find any clear evidence of Russian direction behind this movement, but having regard to the proved connexions of the Russians with the Tudeh party it is unlikely that the movement is being carried on without their approval. On more than one occasion the Russians have not hesitated to represent hostility to the Tudeh party as hostility to themselves. In Isfahan they have trumped up charges against the opposition party, the Vatas, as a pretext for asking the police to take action against that party. 13. In Summary No. 22/44, paragraph 11 , it was reported that a party of Russians had visited the Georgian villages of the Feraiden district. Later reports say that the mam concern of the Russians seemed to be to convince the villagers how much better off were the Georgians under Soviet rule. A Russian musical composer is now to visit Bakhtiari to study Bakhtiari folk music. Other reports had previously been received of Russian attempts to get into touch with Bakhtiari and other tribal chiefs. ? Having regard to Seyyid Zia’s attempts to gain tribal support, to Seyyid Zia’s supposed connexion with the British and to the close relations of British officials with the tribes, it is not surprising that the Russians should want to know what is going on. British Affairs. 14. Aid-to-Russia supplies are no longer to be carried to Tabriz by British military or U.K.C.C. transport, the Russians having requested that British-. operated motor transport should deliver to Pahlevi only. The British Consulate now remains the only British interest in Azerbaijan to justify the entry of British officials to this part of the Russian zone.

Enclosure. Political. Persian Affairs. \ II is reliably reported that the Tudeh party recently proposed to Seyyid Zia that he should collaborate with them in the formation of a Government to be constituted of Ministers selected half by the Tudeh party and half by Seyyid Zia. I hey unclei took to secure Russian support for, or at least neutrality towards, such a. Government. It is almost inconceivable that the Tudeh party had the intention of collaborating sincerely with Seyyid Zia in the government of the country, and it is more probable that they felt confident that with members of the party occupying half the seats in the Cabinet they would in time be in a position to oust and discredit Seyyid Zia. It is noteworthy that for some days the Tudeh papers ceased their previously incessant attacks on him. Approaches have also been made to Seyyid Zia by certain military officers in close touch with the Shah with the suggestion that they would support him in forming a Govern ment if he undertook to leave the army in the unfettered control of the Shah. Seyyid Zia has already had experience of the impotence of a Government wffiich does not control the army. There is now some talk of an intention on the part of the Shah and this military cabal to seek Russian support for the formation of a military Government. They are enraged by their failure to get rid of Millspaugh and the restrictions he imposes on the army by his financial control 2 . There was a serious fire on the night of the lOth-llth July in the Sabzeh Maidan quarter of Tehran which destroyed a number of shops and caused considerable damage. The American troops in Tehran sent two fire engines to assist the Persian Fire Brigade, but shortage of water severely handicapped attempts to fight the fire. ~ ^ rr 3.

A well-known agitator, Khalil Inqilab, has been holding mass meetings in the streets of Tabriz, violently attacking the local authorities, the Government and Seyyid Zia, and championing the two Russian-supported Deputies, Pishavari and Ipekchian. It was inevitably believed that the agitation had Russian backing and that the object was to frighten the Majlis into approving the credentials of these two Deputies (see paragraph 17 of this Summary). After discussion with the Soviet authorities the Governor-General plucked up courage to order the arrest of Inqilab by Persian troops. The mob resisted and the troops were obliged to open fire, killing Inqilab’s principal lieutenant. 9. In Western Azerbaijan the Kurds have again been on the warpath, attacking and looting villages in the neighbourhood of Rezaieh and even entering that town and occupying a hotel in the centre. Villagers flocked into Rezaieh to demand protection. The Russian garrison took no action against the tribesmen, but Major-General Glinski, commanding Soviet troops in Azerbaijan, has left Tabriz for Rezaieh presumably to restore order. Fars. td i u ^ The Darashuri section of the Qashgai tribe has been encroaching on Bakhtiari territory, has carried off grain from some villages in that territory and came into conflict with a Bakhtiari shooting party which resulted in the exchange of shots and the wounding of a Bakhtiari Khan. Morteza Quli Khan, who is not on good terms with Nasir Qashgai and was usually hostile to Nasir’s father, professing the greatest contempt for them both and for all Qashgais. is greatly incensed and has asked Nasir whether these hostile acts had his approval or whether he, Morteza Quli, should assume that Nasir was unable to control j “is tribe. It would be interesting to know the true answer to this query. Isfahan. . 11 . The operations for the disarmament of certain sections of the Bakhtiari (see Summary No. 27/44, paragraph 9) have been suspended. The Persian Gommander is believed to have profited largely from sums paid by some of the chiefs whom it was intended to disarm. Khuzestan. 12 . The punitive operation against the Arabs of the Mianab district (see .Summary No. 26/44, paragraph 5) appears to be proceeding satisfactorily as judged by Persian standards; and so far there have been no repercussions in other Arab areas. It seems generally to be accepted that the Mianab Sheikhs have got only what they deserve. A statement issued to the press by the General,, a i C a c im l s ^ ia ^ son } e torty Arabs have been killed by the Persian forces, that ie chiets have submitted and that 540 rifles have been collected from the Arabs. 1 ore L -if ia i e re P° r f s state that the four principal offenders among the chiefs ai e sii at large and put the number of rifles collected at a more moderate figure. ie punishment meted out will probably have a salutary effect on the Arabs genera y, who may have been under the impression that the British authorities j would restrain the Persian army from taking action. i PV 1 s ^. a ^ emen ^ 1° ^he press the General Staff claimed that the army has made the tollowing contributions to internal security (i) In Pais, near lasa, the well-known bandit Jan Firuzi has been killed, eleven of his men captured and stolen animals recovered.

(iii) the Bam—Kerman road the brigands 'who have recently been holdin 0, up the road have been captured. Russian A ffairs. 14. Newspapers known to be enjoying Russian support have recently been advocating revolution as the only means of delivering the Persian people from the oppression of the present ruling classes. Preparations for a red revolution, they say, should be made now, so that when the time comes it can be directed towards the immediate establishment of a new regime on the ruins of the old. The same papers have also been giving some attention to the matter of further oil concessions, for which applicants are now in Tehran. The general line taken is that it is not sufficient to take commercial considerations only into account and* to give concessions to the highest bidder; the political effects of giving a concession to a foreign country should be carefully wmighed; if it w 7 ere to go to America it was likely that Persia would find herself in political difficulties in the future. 15. Reports are again current in Azerbaijan of an increase of Soviet armoured units on the 1 urkish frontier and of a general increase of Soviet troops in Tabriz and elsewhere in Azerbaijan. 16. The Russians are now reported to have extended their surveys (see Summary No. 23/44, paragraph 13) to the Gunabad district south of the Kal-i- Shur River, which has hitherto formed the southern limit of Soviet penetration in Khorassan. 17. The Majlis has, to the great annoyance of the Tudeh party, invalidated the election of Pishavari. one of the Deputies forced on Tabriz by^ the Russians (see Summary No. 18/44, paragraph 7). 18.

There have been no developments of importance during the week. Dissensions continue in the Cabinet. The Majlis is inflated with pride at its courage in braving Russian anger by throwing out the Tabriz Deputy, Pishayari (see Summary No. 28/44, paragraph 17), and is now preparing itself to eject the other Deputy forced on Tabriz, Ipekchian, and the even more scandalously- elected member for Ardebil, Sheikh Hussein Lenkorani. The Majlis has seen telegrams sent by Soheily, when Prime Minister, to the president of the Election Committee in Tabriz giving the names of four Deputies whom the Russians insisted on having elected for Tabriz, the president s reply that the election of these four would provoke a revolution in Tabriz and a further telegram from the Prime Minister saying that he had persuaded the Russians to be content with Pishavari and Ipekchian, whom the president must get elected. Economic. 2 The Government tabled a Labour Bill in the Majlis on the 16th July, of which the principal points are : — No employment of children under 13; a 48-hour week; one day s holiday with pay per week; a fortnight’s holiday with pay per year; no night work for children under 15 or for women; minimum wage m each Shahristan to be fixed by special tribunal; permission to workers to form unions; differences between employers and employees to be referred to regional tribunals; prohibition of the use of force or threats to coeice workers to strike or to join unions. 3 .

The situation in Western Azarbaijan (see Summary No. 28/44, para graph 9) is now reported to have quietened down as the result of Russian insistence that the Kurds should return to their villages. But they did not take this action until disorder had become widespread, many villages suffering from Kurdish pillaging and several small gendarmerie posts being disarmed by Kurds. The Soviet authorities refused to allow the Persian military authorities to take action; reinforcements of two companies of Persian troops sent from Tabriz to Khoi, with the permission of the Soviet authorities in Tabriz, were sent back by the Soviet commander in Khoi; and the proposal of the Persian Government to send reinforcements from Tehran to Rezaieh was vetoed by the Soviet authorities. It was not until the Persian authorities had been thoroughly discredited in the eyes of the Kurds and of the villagers and townspeople of* Western Azarbaijan that the Russians said the word that would have checked the Kurds at any time. The Persian Government has now appointed a military governor-general for Western Azarbaijan. Bakhtiari. 8 . It has been decided to modify the plans for the disarmament of out lying sections of the Chaharlang tribes (see Summary No. 27/44, paragraph 9) and to postpone action against the more truculent sections—the Abdulvand and Hajivand—until they move down to their more vulnerable winter quarters. Pressure is, however, to continue to be applied to Khajeh Mehdi Quli, of the Moghui, to induce him to hand over his arms or more money. Khuzistan. 9. The operation against the Mian Ah Arabs (see Summary No. 28/44, para- grapn 12) has apparently been satisfactorily concluded. Over 600 rifles have been collected and, with a few exceptions, the worst offenders have been arrested. The troops have now begun the disarmament of the Chananeh and some of the Western Chaab. Russian Affairs. 10. Soviet policy in Azarbaijan is, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Consul- General, fairly consistently designed to undermine and discredit the authority of the Persian Government. If the recent disturbances at Tabriz (see Summary No. 28/44, paragraph 8 ) and the disorder in Western Azarbaijan (see Summary No. 28/44, paragraph 9) were not deliberately instigated by the Russians, they were tolerated for the reason that they furthered Russian designs. They do not attempt to conceal their opposition to the American advisers and they thereby acquire some merit with the landlords and capitalists whose favour they seek equally with that of the proletariat. The departure of British military and U.K.C.C. personnel has been interpreted as being due to the Russian desire to eliminate all other foreign influence from Azarbaijan. A further indication of the desire to interest Moslems of Persian Azarbaijan in Soviet Azarbaijan is the proposal to send 200 young Persian Moslems to Baku for a year’s training in administration and economics. 11 . His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports recent arrivals in Tabriz of additional guns and tanks for the Soviet forces and an increase in the number of aircraft from about thirty to about sixty. See also Summary No. 28/44, paragraph 15.3 12. The report in Summary No. 28/44, paragraph 16, that the Russians are now surveying south of the Kal i Shur River in Khorassan has been proved to be untrue. Their survey parties have not yet crossed that river. 13. The matter of further oil concessions in Persia continues to receive attention in newspapers under obligations to the Russians. These are now claiming that the Soviet Government have still certain rights as regards the Citation of oil in the Northern Provinces and that these provinces are closed to any other foreign Power. Every attempt is being made to arouse fear in the Persians of the possible political consequences of granting concessions to Americans, who, for the time being, are evidently regarded as being more dangerous than the British. Dr. Millspaugh is represented as having been forced on the Persian Government to further the interests of American oil hunters. 14. A new Soviet Consul-General, Abranov, and Vice-Consul, Uzhurov, have arrived in Meshed. The former was at Naples with the Soviet Mission to the Badoglio Government. Uzhurov was previously at Kermanshah. British Affairs. 15. The Shah and the Queen attended a hockey match between two Indian military teams, and the Queen gave away the prizes.r .

Tehran, 1th August, 1944. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 30 for the Period 24^A Jidy-Qth August, 1944. (Secret.) —* Persian Affairs. Political. ALTHOUGH Deputies express much discontent with the ineffectiveness of the Cabinet and there is much talk of the necessity for a reconstruction with some | new Ministers, there appears still to be a majority in favour of the retention of j Sa’ed as Prime Minister for the time being. Seyyid Zia is gaining increasing respect, but it seems to be generally considered that it is not yet time for him to make a bid for power. The Tudeh members, supported, it is commonly said, by the Shah, are trying to get a revision of the rejection of the credentials of Pishavari (see Summary No. 28/44. paragraph 17) and to prevent the rejection of the credentials of Ipekchian and Shukh Hussein Lenkcrani when they are considered by the Majlis. Meanwhile, very little'legislative work gets done. Of twenty-eight Bills laid before the Majlis during the life of the present Govern ment, only seven have been passed. One—the Bill to mobilise Government employees and factory workers, which was mentioned in Summary No. 18/44, paragraph 1 —has been rejected. None of the others has passed the first reading. 2. The ex-Shah, Reza Pahlevi, died at Johannesburg on the 26th July. Conventional mourning customs have been ordered and observed in Tehran. The Tudeh Deputies refused to be associated with the Majlis’ conventional message of sympathy to the Shah. The Tudeh press and some other papers have objected to any demonstration of mourning. 3. Hassan Taqizadeh, Majid Ahi and Anoshirvan Sipahbodi, Persian Ambassadors in London, Moscow and Angora respectively, have been summoned to Tehran for consultation. Mahmud Jam, Persian Ambassador in Egypt, has already arrived in Tehran. Economic. 4. A Bill has been laid before the Majlis that would have nullified that part of Dr. Millspaugh’s regulations governing the collection of the coming harvest that related to the right of the Government to take the surplus grain of the peasant as well as of the landlord. Dr. Millspaugh has. however, anticipated the decision of the Majlis by agreeing to cancel the regulation as far as it relates to the peasant’s surplus. It was estimated that 50,000 tons of grain would have been obtained from that source. 5. The weekly postal service between Tehran and Bushire, to which reference was made in Summary No. 25/44, paragraph 8 . has been suspended. A appointments — Civil. 6 .

A meeting will shortly take place near Qumisheh between Qavam-ul-Mulk, Nasir Qashgai, Morteza Quli Bakhtiari and a representative of the huipi Ilkhani family of the Bakhtiari Khans. Nasir Qashgai wishes to invite Abdullah^ Khan Zarghampur Boir Ahmadi to attend, but this is not regarded with favoul by the others, since Abdullah Khan has not yet made his peace officially with the Government. The purpose of the meeting is to confirm the pact of friendship and co-operation made between Qavam-ul-Mulk and the Qashgai brothers, which was reported in Summary No. 26/44, paragraph 4, and to extend it to include the Bakhtiari Khans. The meeting is no secret; the Governor-General of bars has been invited to attend and the Shah is aware that it is to take place. It wi almost certainly appear to the Russians as a step in a plan for the formation of a pro-British bloc of tribes in South Persia. Resistance to subversive Tudeh and ; Russian influence is admittedly one of the objects of the originators, and for that reason it is viewed with favour by property owners in the south. Pars. 8 . Some activity is being shown by Government forces in the pursuit of minor bandits. The'General Staff, in a communique to the press, report the capture of five leaders of robber bands. Bakhtiari. 9. Morteza Quli Khan, Governor of Bakhtiari, who was summoned to Tehran to answer complaints made against him (see Summary No. 2/'/44&gt; paragraph 8 ), has now returned to Bakhtiari with the renewed confidence of the | Government, though not of the Shah. He discomfited his enemies and made an armistice with his quarrelsome relatives which is unlikely to develop into a lasting peace. He has agreed to accept a representative of the rk al branch of the family, the Haji Ilkhani, as a subordinate associate in the Government of the tribe. Dissension is, however, likely to break out again unless the Government comes to a decision on the matter of claims the Khans have for the restitution of, or compensation for, lands exchanged or sold under compulsion on the orders of Reza Shah. The fate of these lands is not of great interest to the Bakhtiari tribesmen, but as long as the Khans are dissatisfied with the Government or with each other there is the danger of their stirring up the tribes to disorder. The Shah, perhaps mindful of the part the Bakhtiari tribe has played in the past against would-be dictatorial Shahs, is reported to have been none too content when he heard that the Khans had come to an agreement among themselves and that Morteza Quli Khan had rather strengthened his position. In order to limit his i sphere of influence, it has been suggested that the Chahar Lang tribes should be separated from the Haft Lang and given a separate Governor. This proposal has the support of some of the Chahar Lang Khans and of the General Staff. Khuzestan. 10. The Persian General Staff reports that 850 rifles had been collected from the Mianab Arabs and about twenty of the sheikhs had been arrested. From the Chananeh some 300 rifles had been collected with little or no opposition. (See Summary No. 29/44. paragraph 9.) Russian Affairs. 11 . His Majesty’s Consul-General in Azerbaijan reports that, in spite of all their efforts to ingratiate themselves with the populace, the Russians are still regarded with mistrust and suspicion by the great majority of the Moslems of Azerbaijan. Soviet officials have not attempted to conceal their annoyance at the 'rejection by the Majlis of Pishavari’s credentials (see Summary No. 28/44, paragraph 17) and have taken the Governor-General roundly to task. Soviet agents in Tabriz are now attempting to work up demonstrations, and perhaps even a general strike, in the hope of stampeding the Government'into obliging the Majlis to revise its decision. 12. After much discussion between the Persian Government and the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, the Russians have now agreed that Persian forces in Azerbaijan may have liberty of action to suppress disorder, but they have stipulated that one garrison may not be reinforced from another, nor may3 reinforcements be sent from outside the province. As Persian garrisons in Azerbaijan are very weak, their actions for the suppression of disorder are not likely to be effective. 13. His Majesty’s Consul-General in Azerbaijan reports that Persian officials in Western Azerbaijan profess to have seen recently signs of growing Soviet hostility to Turkey and that Turkish officials were showing some nervous ness about possible Soviet plans. (This was before Turkey broke off relations with Germany.) In Summary No. 26/44, paragraph 3, it was reported that the Russian-inspired newspaper Darya had accused Turkey of plotting against the integrity of Persia by claiming that there were in the country minorities with special affinities with the Turks. The consul-general in Azerbaijan comments that Turkish officials in that province show remarkably little political activity and not the slightest evidence of any desire to acquire influence among Persian subjects of Turki stock. 14. The newspaper Darya, to which reference has been made in previous Summaries, has ceased publication. Its promoters seem to have decided to anticipate the suppression that could not have been long delayed having regard to the strong protests made by the British Embassy against its provocatively anti-British (but always pro-Russian) tone. 15. In Summary No. 27/44, paragraph 13, some evidence was given of Russian interest in the Bakhtiari tribe. A party of Russian officers and soldiers with motor transport was recently noticed at Shalamzar, 20 miles south of Shahr Kurd, in Bakhtiari tribal country. The purpose of their visit there is not known. French Affairs. 16. 1,500 Alsatians, who had been conscripted into the German army and later taken prisoner in Russia, have passed through Tehran from Russia en route for North Africa.

Tehran, \Mh A ugust, 1944. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary Ro. 31, for the period 7th August to \3th August, 1944. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. 1 . The Government is to be interpellated on the 17th x\ugust on a matter connected with the administration of the State railways. It is expected that the Prime Minister will survive the interpellation, but that he will be obliged to make some changes in his Cabinet. He will be urged to change, among others, the Minister of War, who is regarded by the Majlis as-being a mere cypher, subservient to the Shah. 2 . A new party, calling itself “Mardum,' has been formed under the leadership of Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai, the President of the Majlis. It includes nine members of the National Union (the Ittifaq-i-Milli) group in the Majlis—see Summary No. 13/44, paragraph 2 —eight other Deputies and Amanullah Ardalan, Minister of Commerce, Ibrahim Zand, Minister for War, and Murteza Quli Bayat, Minister without portfolio. Its manifesto, which bears some 160 names, says that the aim of the party is to achieve the unity of the nation for the preservation of the freedom and independence of Persia and the restoration of the true principles of democratic government. It calls for the observance of social principles which it labels in brackets as “socialism.” The party includes some known Shah’s men, and it is likely that the Shah has favoured its formation. The list of names attached to the manifesto is not impressive, and it is not considered likely that the party will be constructive or wilhsupport the American mission. 3. Much attention has been given in the Persian press to an interview given by Dr. Millspaugh to the newspaper Sitara, where he is quoted as having said that his mission had been sent to safeguard the independence of Persia. America was the only country that had consistently championed the independence of Persia. If the American Mission had not come, disorders would have broken out all over the country and that would have resulted either in the complete occupation of North and South Persia by the British and Russian armies respectively; or in the occupation of Persia by an international army; or in the re-establishment of dictatorship. Dr. Millspaugh has been very severely criticised by the Persian press for these statements. The position of the American mission has not visibly improved. There is even suspicion, voiced in no uncertain terms by the Shah himself, that Dr. Millspaugh is deliberately trying to ruin the economy of Persia in order to give America the excuse for taking control of it. This is Russian propaganda. 4. The Tudeh party is now holding its first General Conference in Tehran. It is attended by 170 delegates, of whom the great majority is from the Northern Provinces. Isfahan sends seven, and there are representatives from Qum, Saveh, Sultanabad, Ahwaz, Durud and Andimezhk. The conference has expelled from the party the Deputy for Babul because he took part in mourning ceremonies [56 78]2 for Reza Shah; has dissolved the local committee at Shahravar for the same reason and expelled another member for “ co-operation with reactionaries.” 5. As it becomes more apparent to Persians that the war will end not merely in the defeat of Germany but in the complete destruction of German power, their vision of the future is filled by a Russia, free of anxiety in the West • and the East, and of unchallengeable supremacy in Central Asia. In Russia’s ; regard for her pledged word they have no confidence whatever. Of Russia’s designs on the Northern Provinces they are convinced. Of the efficacy of British ■or American support they are doubtful. In Russian policy in Persian Azarbaijan combined with Russian opposition to appointments or measures that might lead to the strength of stability of the Central Government they see the resolve to create a situation that will lead to the outbreak on the withdrawal of Russian troops of a greater disorder than the Persian Government can remedy and an appeal from tutored parties in Azarbaijan for Russian intervention. It is not difficult to find evidence on which to base such a theory. What Russia may do overshadows all other considerations in the minds of men of property and wealth. Some such as Qavam es Sultaneh and General Muqaddam, lately Governor- General of Azarbaijan, toady to the Russians; others are considering liquidating their property with a view to transferring their capital abroad. Economic. 6 . In reply to a question in the Majlis asking for information about the Government’s negotiations with oil-concession hunters known to be in Tehran the Prime Minister replied : In October and November 1943 two representatives of the Shell Company arrived in Tehran with proposals for the grant of a con cession in South-East Persia. They were followed in February 1944 by a repre sentative of the Standard Oil Company with proposals for the same area and about the same time the Sinclair Oil Company informed the Government that they were also making proposals for a concession. To assist the Government in studying these various proposals for a concession two American experts, Messrs. Hoover and Curtis, were engaged as advisers and they were now in Tehran. The leader of the Tudeti party in the Majlis protested against the engage ment of Americans to advise on a question in which American oil companies were interested. A 'p'pointments — civil. 7. Muhsin Turbati to be Farmandar of Dasht-i-Mishan in Khuzeztan. Persian Forces. A rmy. 8 . The Minister for War has tabled tw T o Bills, one of which makes it now a crime for an officer to draw pay for imaginary employees or to employ as his servants more men paid from army sources than the regulations permit or to hire out men paid from the army budget for his own profit; the other specified punishments awardable to military personnel who use army transport for their own profit. Gendarmerie. 9. In an interview with the reporter of a Persian newspaper Col. Schwarzkopf gave an outline of his ambitious scheme for the reorganisation of the gendarmerie. He said that after a lengthy study of social, economic and agricultural conditions his plans were now nearly ready to be put into execution. I He did not mention that they require more than twice as much money as Dr. Millspaugh is prepared to allot. He said he had already instituted schools for officers and n.c.o.s. Asked what he had done to improve the morale tone of the gendarmerie, Col. Schwarzkopf replied that only in rare cases was he able to get definite evidence of corruption. He admitted that he had not yet succeeded in 'eliminating all theft, bribery and oppression, but he claimed that he had reduced these crimes. A f^pointments — military. 10 —(i) Sarhang Muhammed Reza Shahandeh to command the 19th (Kwash) Brigade. (ii) Sarhang Abdul Hussein Hijazi to be Military Governor of Tehran, (iii) Staff Sarhang Abbas Hidayet to be Deputy Director of Army Transport.3 Internal Security. 11 . Two of the Arabs arrested after the operations in the Mianab area— /&gt;' see Summary No. 30/44, paragraph 10 —have been hanged for highway robbery and several others have been condemned to death. The effect, as far as it is known ^^pt present, has been good. Russian Affairs. 12. Reports from so many sources speak of considerable recent increases in the number of Russian troops in the Sharpur-Maku area of Western Azerbaijan that it may be accepted that there has been some increase. From fairly reliable sources it is reported that there are Soviet tanks in notable numbers in Shahpur, Khoi and at Bazergan on the Turkish frontier. Under orders from the Soviet commander air raid precautions have been instituted in Sharpur. These dis positions are interpreted locally as Russian menaces against Turkey. Russian policy towards the Kurds is also suspected of being directed with a view to their being used against the Turks. 13. A party of Russian officers and n.c.o.s recently visited Bushire for a few days and stayed at the old Russian Consulate.

The interpellation of the Government has been postponed until next week, the Deputies having been unable to make up their minds as to what they want in the way of a Cabinet. They wished the Prime Minister to reconstitute the Cabinet before the interpellation, but he prefers to wait and see if he will be given a vote of confidence. 2. Yet another political party has been formed, the “ Kar,” under the leadership of Dr. Musharraf Nafisi (F.O. 154, M.A. 190). It published the usual admirable programme with perhaps less than the usual insincerity, for Dr. Nafisi, although unpopular on account of his blunt, ungracious manner, is genuine in his desire for better things. He believes, and includes it in his party programme, \ that Persia should be administered by Persians for the benefit of Persians. He disagrees strongly with some of Dr. Millspaugh s measures. The first issue oi the party newspaper, Pand, enquires why the Allies should keep so many troops in Persia, especially in places like Khorassan which are very remotely concerned with the war. 3. The matter of Dr. Millspaugh’s remarks published in the Sitara, to which reference was made in Summary No. 31/44, paragraph 3, has been raised \in the Majlis. Strong exception was taken to Dr. Millspaugh’s claim to be the defender of Persian independence against Persia’s allies. The Prime Minister was asked what action was being taken by the Government since the Government was responsible for public statements made by its employees, of whom Dr. Millspaugh was one. 4 . The meeting between the three potentates of South Persia, referred to in paragraph 8 below, attracted some attention in the press, meeting with the approval of some newspapers and provoking others to suggestions that it was a dangerous plot against the independence of Persia organised by foreigners. There is some anxiety lest the Russians, believing the agreement between the Southern tribes to be a British move, may attempt to form a similar union, under their influence, among the tribes of Azerbaijan. The Shah is suspicious that unity in the south may not be in his ultimate interest. Economic. 5 . The Cabinet has approved the formation of a Supreme Economic Council to act in an advisory capacity to the Government. It will be composed of twenty- four members, of whom eighteen will be nominated for a period of three years by a decree of the Cabinet on the proposal of the Prime Minister and six will be [57-9]2 {«&lt; elected by those eighteen. The duty of this council will be to advise the Govern ment on all those matters which are within the province of Dr. Millspaugh’s j mission. A ypointments — Civil. 6 .

Persian Forces. 7. Ten of the fifteen Anson aircraft to be given to the Persian Government in exchange for the Mohawk aircraft taken from them in 1941 have been delivered in Tehran, having been flown from Cairo by Persian pilots—see also Summary No. 23/44, paragraph 6 . Internal Security. South Persia. 8 . Ihe meeting between the Qavam-ul-Mulk, Morteza Quli Bakhtiari and 1 Nasir Qashgai, referred to in Summary No. 30/44, paragraph 7, resulted in i satisfaction to at least the two former. Nasir’s views are not known. It was : conducted in a friendly spirit and all three signed a document pledging themselves not to act against the interests of the Allies, to consult together before taking any action affecting each other’s or their mutual interests and to stand together to protect their common interests. At Nasir’s request a paragraph was added to the effect that Abdullah Zarghampur Boir Ahmadi would be allowed to adhere ; to this pact if he wished to do so. Abdullah Zarghampur is at present meeting with much opposition in his own tribes and it is doubtful whether his adherence will be of much value. He has appealed to Nasir for assistance, but it is reported that Nasir would now willingly get rid of his long-standing commitment to stand by Abdullah Zarghampur. Bakhtiari. 9. The Persian General Staff report some 300 rifles have been collected without opposition from Moghui and Zilleki sections of the Chahar Lang Bakhtiari—each tribe has been allowed to keep twenty-five for its own protection. The troops are now being withdrawn to Isfahan. See Summary No. 29/44, paragraph 8 . Khuzestan. 10 . Five more of the Arabs arrested after the disarmament operations in Mianab have been hanged, making seven in all—«ee Summary No. 31/44, ] paragraph 11 . All reliable reports agree that the effect on the Arabs generally has been good. Kurdistan. 11 . Some sections of the Jaf tribes who had migrated from Iraq to Persia refused to obey the orders of the Persian Government regarding the payment of grazing fees. Troops of the Saqqiz and Senneh garrisons were sent to enforce obedience. In the ensuing clash the Jaf suffered twenty to thirty casualties and were driven into Iraq. The Persian troops report two casualties and the death of a khan of the Tilekuh tribe who were supporting the troops. Shahrud. 12. An anti-Bahai riot occurred at Shahrud in which several persons were killed. Order was restored by the Persian and Russian authorities.

The Government resigned on the 26th August and Sa’ed, promised the support of eighty-five Deputies of the Azad, Mihan and Ittifaq-i-Melli groups, has been entrusted with the formation of a new Cabinet. Presumably the three groups above mentioned will dictate its composition. Some Deputies, perhaps a majority, are demanding a complete change. Jt is unlikely that the unity of these groups in support of Sa’ed or of any aim will last for long, and it is generally considered that the new Cabinet, however composed, will be but a stop-gap Administration. Seyyid Zia is being spoken of more and more as the eventual most suitable successor to Sa’ed; but Seyyid Zia himself does not think that he can yet count on sufficient solid support. Relations between him and the Shah have recently improved outwardly, and Seyyid Zia’s supporters find cause for optimism in a recent long interview he had with the Shah which he reported as having been satisfactory and as having resulted in a large measure of agree ment on important points of policy. The Russians, however, show no signs of reducing their opposition to Seyyid Zia, and it is too early yet to accept as genuine the Shah’s apparent inclination towards faith in his virtues. 2. An analysis of the 128 Deputies who have taken their seats in the Majlis shows that sixty-five are themselves landowners, thirteen come from the commer cial and industrial classes, four are priests. Of the remaining forty-six a number have been elected through the influence of landlords and merchants whose interests they serve. The majority of the Deputies, therefore, represent no political party, nor do they stand for any political principle, nor even for the interests of the constituency from which they have been elected. Indeed, some of them are not even known in their constituencies. It is consequently not surprising that attempts to form a stable party in the Majlis have hitherto met with no success. Groups are formed which coalesce or disintegrate for sonm purely temporary or local reason. The 14th Majlis has shown even less sense of public responsibility and less unity than the 13th, and during the six months of its life it has passed practically no legislation. (See also Summary No. 30/44. paragraph 1 .) The three years of parliamentary government that the country has experienced since the abdication of Reza Shah ha ve do ne nothing to dispel [57 - SI ,. i 9- PCT19/M f i INDIA .FRCP*doubts of Persia’s fitness for democratic government. Indeed, the conviction grows that no Government can function effectively while dependent for approval on so mercurial and irresponsible a body. The Shah wishes to form the Senate, which is provided for in the Constitution, possibly with the idea of closing the Majlis while preserving in the Senate some slight appearance of regard for the Constitution. He is the more inclined to this idea in that he has the right of^k appointing thirty of the sixty members of the Senate. ' 3. report on the proceedings of the Tudeh party conference (see Summary No. 31/44, paragraph 4) has been published in the party press. Among the resolutions passed were : to fight Seyyid Zia and other dictatorial elements; to oppose all foreign advisers from whatever country they come; to oppose the grant of any economic concession that may weaken the economic independence of the Persian nation; to support friendly relations with all freedom-loving nations on a basis of mutual respect and complete recognition of the political and economic independence of Persia; to encourage the development and consolidation of labour unions and organise peasants and officials. Approval was given to the action of the Tudeh Deputies in fighting Seyyid Zia and the illegal actions of the American advisers. Dissatisfaction with the present control and organisation of the party was shown by resolutions to ensure better accounting for the party’s funds, to tighten up party discipline, to ensure better co-operation between the centre and branches, and to purge the party of doubtful elements. The dominating personalities at the conference appear to have been Ovanasian, the Deputy for Armenians of the north, and Radmanish, Deputy for Lahijan. The former was trained at the Sociological College in Moscow and has spent many years in prison for Communist activity. 4. The Government has decided to prohibit the pilgrimage to Mecca this year as far as Persian subjects are concerned. Economic. 5. The National Bank reports that notes in circulation now amount to 6,199,590,740 rials out of a total of notes printed to the value of 8,212,495,684 rialsy 6 . That prominent Deputy, Dr. Musaddiq, recently proposed in the Majlis that the Government should charge the Allies twice the cost price of any wheat delivered to them. He alleged that in the twelve months April 1943 to March 1944 the Allies had taken 100.000 tons of wheat. It is now a recognised Persian practice to use the word “ Allies ” when complaining of Russian actions, but to refer categorically to British and Americans in similar circumstances. The proposal was unanimously approved. Appointments — Civil. 7. —(i) Sherif Darakchi to be Farmandar of Birjand. (ii) Hadi Shahnaze to be Farmandar of Shafarud.

Fhe opposition to Abdullah Khan Zarghampur^ which was mentioned in Summary No. 32/44, paragraph 8 , is being encouraged by the Persian military ^authorities in Khuzestan, who appear to be endeavouring to form a coalition of ^°i r Ahmadi chiefs who resent Abdullah Khan’s attempts to impose himself as chief on all the Boir Ahmadi tribes. The chief of one section of the Mamassani also shows some inclination to join the opposition, who are alleged to be receiving ammunition from the Persian military authorities. Abdullah Khan has appealed to Nasir Qashgai to implement his promise of support. The object of the Khuzestan military authorities, which is said to have the approval of the ^ Shah, is to break up the combination of the southern tribes and to weaken them by provoking them to fight each other. The Governor-General of Pars is, however, of the opinion that this provocation is likely only to create disorder and he is recommending the abandonment of this policy. Russian Affairs. 10 . At a meeting in the Armenian Club in Tehran it was decided that Persian Armenians should be asked to contribute funds for the equipment of a tank regiment for the Soviet Army, to be named after the Armenian general Bagramian. 11. During the current month 2.400 Russian ex-prisoners of war, liberated on European fronts, have been handed over to the Soviet authorities in Tehran by the British military authorities.

THE following Cabinet was presented to the Shah on the 31st August:— Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs : Muhammad Sa’ed Maragheh. War : General Muhammad Hussein Eiruz (F.O. 72; M.A. 94). Education : Baqir Kazemi (F.O. 110; M. A. 142). Justice: Allahyar Saleh (F.O. 198; M.A. 253). Finance : Ali Asghar Zarinkafsh (F.O. 236; M.A. 309). Commerce and Industry : Hr. Muhammad Nakhai (F.O. 157). Interior : Muhammad Sururi (F.O. 219). Posts and Telegraphs : Yusuf Mushar. Communications : Muhammad Nariman. Health : Dr. Manuchihr Iqbal (Acting) (F.O. 94). Agriculture : Vacant. Without Portfolio : Khalil Fahimi (F.O. 59; M.A. 82). Only the Prime Minister and the Minister without Portfolio were in the previous Cabinet. Of the others Baqir Kazemi, Allahyar Saleh and Muhammad Nariman have previously held Cabinet rank, the two last-named for very brief periods. Zarinkafsh, Nakhai, Sururi and Iqbal have recently been relatively satisfactory Under-Secretaries. 2. The ministers were selected from the list of twenty-five presented to the Prime Minister by the three groups, referred to in Summary No. 33/44, para graph 1, who had combined for the purpose of Cabinet-making. The Tudeh party and the independent members were strongly opposed to the intervention of the Majlis in the selection of ministers, and the former were opposed to the return of Sa’ed as Prime Minister. When the Cabinet came to be presented to the Majlis the Tudeh and independent members absented themselves, with the result that there was not the necessary quorum to make the presentation legal. No one prophesies more than a short life, measured by most prophets in days, for this Cabinet. General Firuz has not yet accepted his nomination. A ppointments—C ivil. 3. Ismail Mehdi to be Persian Consul-General in Baku. Kuh-i-Galu. Internal Security. 4 . The Persian Government has enjoined caution on its military author ities in Khuzestan in their encouragement of the coalition opposed to Abdullah Zarghampur, since they are not yet in a position to take advantage of hostilities [57—54]2 which might involve the Mamassani and Qashgai tribes on opposite sides and might lead to a situation which the Persian authorities could not control. At the same time they want to keep the Opposition simmering and they will probably not discourage resistance by other Boir Ahmadi chiefs to Abdullah Zarghampur s attempts to impose his authority over them. See Summary No. 33/44, paragraph 9. 7 . . '6 Western Azerbaijan. 5 . Following on action by the Persian authorities in ejecting Persian Herki Kurds under the troublesome chief Zero Beg from several villages in the Daranduz district and the establishment there of gendarmerie posts, reports were current that Herki tribesmen from Iraq and armed followers of Mullah Mustafa had crossed the Persian frontier and were being joined by Mamesh and Begzadeh tribesmen. Their intention was said to be to drive the Persian authorities from Rezaieh and to set up a Kurdish administration. A later report said that, after negotiations between the tribes, who had concentrated in Margivar, and the commander of the Persian gendarmerie in Rezaieh, supported by a Russian official,, the tribes had dispersed peacefully. Syrian Affairs. 6 . The Persian Government has recognised the Government of Syria. Russian Affairs. 7. The Russian military party which was recently reported in Bakhtiari —see Summary No. 30/44, paragraph 15—made enquiries as to the number of arms in possession of the southern tribes and whether arms are reaching these tribes from any source. From comments in the Tudeh press it seems that the Russians believe the pact recently made between the three tribal representatives of the south (although Qavam ul Mulk can hardly be said to represent the Khamseh tribes nowadays) to have been engineered by the British as a defensive or perhaps offensive measure against the Tudeh. On the other hand, the Shah has given as reason for the recent collection of arms from certain sections of the Chahar Lang Bakhtiari his belief that Russian agents had recently been intriguing among those tribes. 8 . At a garden party held in Tabriz in aid of Red Army charities the sum of 1J million rials is said to have been collected. The methods used to extort subscriptions were the usual blackmail and threats.

OPPOSITION in the Majlis has successfully managed to prolong the Cabinet crisis by a spate of talk and criticism which has lasted throughout the week and postponed the taking of a vote on the Government’s programme. It is generally expected that the Government will have a majority when the vote is taken, but it can have no confidence that it will long be able to enjoy the support of a majority. General Firuz has not accepted his appointment as Minister for War. Indeed, it is reported that he has definitely refused on the grounds that he does not wish to be associated with a Government which has no hope of any effective achievement. 2. The Cabinet has adopted the programme of its predecessor (see Summary No. 13, paragraph 3) with the following additions :— (a) The safeguarding of public security by putting into execution the principle of law; the autonomy of the judiciary and the suppression of all elements of disorder. (b) The stabilisation of prices and the reduction of the cost of living; energetic suppression of hoarding. (c) The execution of the law of compulsory primary education and the revision of programmes of instruction. (d) Restrictions on the cultivation of opium. (e) Reform of the electoral law. Economic. 3. The Persian press states that the value of imports in the year March 1943-March 1944 was 1,527,233,572 rials and in the previous year 1,313,910,532 rials. The value of exports in 1943-44 was 703i,986,178 rials and in the previous year 557,719,058 rials. 4. The Ministry of Health gives the following figures of the incidence of certain diseases in Persia :— Number of Cases reported. Deaths. Typhus (December 1942 to December 1943) ... 12,912 1,617 Smallpox (March 1943 to March 1944) ... 1,253 425 Malaria (March 1942 to March 1943) ... ... 208,559 735 The number of unreported cases probably exceeds the above figures in the case of malaria.2 Persian Forces. A rmy. 5. It has been decided not to proceed with General Ridley’s scheme for the organisation at each divisional headquarters of independent recruit training centres under the control of a central training staff. The scheme was never popular with the present Chief of Staff or with divisional commanders. Only^^. in Tehran had such a centre been fully organised, but during the months it wa^^' in operation it had never been provided with efficient instructors or with necessary equipment. It has now been abolished. Recruits will in future be trained, as before, in regiments. 6 . According to the Chief of the Staff, Dr. Millspaugh has agreed to find a further 15 million tomans for the army budget for the remaining six months of the current financial year. It is not yet known from what source this amount is to be obtained—whether by reducing the allotments to other Ministries, by increased taxation or by borrowing. 7. Thfe remaining five Anson aircraft due to the Persian Government have now arrived in Tehran and have been delivered to the Persian air force (see Summary No. 32/44, paragraph 7). Appointments — Military. 8 . —(i) Sartip ’Ali Akbar She’ri to command 7th (Kerman and Mekran) Division. (ii) Sarhang Mir Hussein Hashimi to command 5th (Luristan) Division.

Western A zerbaijan. 9. From several sources reports have- been received to the effect that the I movement for Kurdish independence is gaining strength in the Mahabad area. Five issues have^now been made of the paper of the movement, the Nishtman, which is believecl to be written mostly in Mahabad and is known to be printed in j Tabriz with the help of the Russians. The Russians are generally suspected of being behind the movement; they are certainly watching it without disapproval. The Persian authorities are growing increasingly anxious. They are still trying to get 'Russian approval to the location of an adequate Persian garrison at 1 Mahabad. Meanwhile, they have posted military officers as Governors of Mahabad and Sardasht, although their authority is likely to be only nominal. They are also considering plans for the extension of Government’s authority in those parts of Kurdistan where the Russians do not impose restrictions on military movements. Kermanshah. 10. A report has been received that Hama Rashid of Baneh, who was in revolt against the Persian Government in 1942, has attacked another Kurdish chief, Mahmud Kanisenani, and driven him out of his village of Merivan. Both these chiefs have for the past two years enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy in their areas and have accepted responsibility and subsidies for the maintenance of order. Mahmud Kanisenani is now appealing for the intervention of Persian j troops. Kurdish chiefs cannot for long refrain from demonstrating to the Persian Government the necessity for the establishment of firm Government authority in Kurdish territory. 11 . Two Kalkhani chiefs, Rashid-es-Sultaneh and Rashid Agha, who had for some months been under detention by the Persian authorities, recently absconded and returned to their tribal country. Operations for their recapture were initiated by Persian troops, and these may have helped to drive the absconders into the territory of a hostile tribe, where one was killed and the other wounded and captured. The prestige of the Persian Government is now considered to have been vindicated. Bakhtiari. 12. ' The Persian Chief of Staff reports that the operations for the collection of arms from the Moghui and certain sections of the Mamivand Chahar Lang have now been completed and that the troops have been withdrawn. His «information is that about 700 rifles have been collected in all and that there are still some 2,000 rifles with the Mamivand. Fars. 13. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, travelling by car on the 10 th September, was shot up about 6 miles north of Shiraz. A Persian Government lorry which was following him was held up and rifled. The brigands have not yet been identified. Russian Affairs. 14. The Russians are increasing the scope of their activities in Persia. They recently opened a hospital in Tabriz for the benefit of Persians, and there are rumours that they are considering opening hospitals in Isfahan and Shiraz. They have announced that Iransovtrans, the Soviet transport organisation operating in Persia for the carriage of supplies to Russia and for Russian military needs, is organising services in South Persia. An office has been opened in Isfahan, and owners of transport under contract to the Persian Road Transport Department are being bribed or otherwise induced to transfer their services to Iransovtrans. Merchants are being canvassed and are being offered rates cheaper than those of the Persian Transport Department, with no obligation to pay anything until the goods are safely delivered. In East Persia also, now that that route is no longer to be operated for supplies to Russia, lorry drivers employed by the U.K.C.C. are joining the Tudeh party and offering their services to Iransovtrans. The Persian Government has been* persuaded to engage two Russian experts for the Ministry of Agriculture to combat the spread of epizootic diseases. These experts will have ample excuse for travelling and making investigations all over Persia. Some anxious excitement has been caused among Persians by the opening of a Russian military camp near the old city of Ray, 6 miles south of Tehran, and by reports that the Russian military authorities are renting houses in the town of Tehran which are all sited so as to command some important building or the residence of some important person. The Russians say that their camp near Ray is for the reception of further parties of ex-prisoners of war whom they expect from Egypt. After investigation at the camp those for repatriation to Russia will be entrained at the adjacent station. Confirmation has not yet been obtained of the reports of the renting of houses.

The Government obtained its vote of confidence, but it has neither confidence in itself nor has it the confidence of the public. Its existence depends on the continued unity of the three Majlis groups, who are its supporters, and on its compliance with the dictates of those combined groups. It has not gained in public esteem by the refusal of General Firuz to accept the Ministry for War. It is strongly opposed by the Russians and the Tudeh party and is not viewed with favour by the Shah, since the Ministers were selected entirely by the Majlis without consideration of his wishes. 2. The press has for some time past been urging the Government to prepare Persia’s claims for compensation for the damage she has suffered and sacrifices she has made in putting her territory and her communications at the disposal of the Allies. It is usual now for Persians to refer to Persia, as the Bridge of Victory and to claim that it was Persia’s contribution that tipped the scale in favour of the Allies. The Ministry of Finance has issued instructions to all departments of the Government to prepare lists of losses and damage incurred since August 1941 as a result of the entry of Allied troops into Persia. In a recent speech to a gathering of Ministers, officials and journalists the Shah i stressed the necessity for ensuring that Persia obtained at the Peace Conference the compensation to which she was entitled for her unstinted sacrifices. He deplored the lack of unity evident in the country at such a critical period and hoped that all members of the community would put aside their personal quarrels and combine to secure for Persia the place to which she was entitled. 3 . In the same speech the Shah called attention to the hardships from which the majority of the population was suffering. The alleviation of this distress was, he said, the responsibility not only of the Government but of all capable and patriotic people. There must be a better exploitation and a more even distribution i of the national resources. The improvement of education and of hygiene was (important, but it was more important still to ensure that the people were fed. 4. Taqizadeh and Sepahbudi, Persian Ambassadors in London and Angora respectively, have arrived in Tehran for consultation with their Government. Jam, the Persian Ambassador in Egypt, is expected shortly. Ahi, Ambassador in Moscow, has also been summoned, but is reported to be too ill to travel.

It is headed by Kavtarzadeh, Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and rumour says that its visit is connected with oil concessions. At a reception given in his honour by the Persian Government, Kavtarzadeh expressed his appreciation of the zeal shown by the Persian Government and nation in assisting the transport of supplies to Russia. 8 . His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that a considerable number of Russian troops have left that town for Russia. French Affairs. 9 .

THE necessity for measures to counteract the effects of Tudeh party propaganda on the workers is being more widely recognised by the governing classes. Moreover, they fear that the departure of Allied troops may result m a large number of unemployed, who will be ready subjects for subieisive P ro P^ ganda. The problem of dealing with these is now engaging the attention ot the Government. And, with a view to inducing the working classes | the Government is concerned with their interest, a commission, which includes representatives of the Ministries of Agriculture and of Commumcations has been formed in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry with the tasks of collect] g information regarding the numbers and conditions of employment of workeis Government factories and industrial establishments; drawing up regulations o avert unemployment among workers; organising centres of technical mstiuct for workers to increase their output; improving the hygienic condition of factories; preparing plans to attract capital to the development of industry and public works.

Hama Rashid followed up his occupation of Merivan (see Summary No. 35/44, paragraph 10 ) by an insolent telegram to the Persian Government which induced them rather reluctantly to agree to operations by Persian troops for the eviction from Merivan of Hama Rashid’s followers and the Governor he had set up there. This operation was successfully carried out with little opposition, although the Persian General Staff claim to have captured some twenty of Hama Rashid’s men and to have inflicted casualties. Operations against Hama Rashid are to be continued by the advance of a column from Saqqiz to Baneh. More serious opposition is expected here. The object of the operation ! is to put an end to Hama Rashid’s rule at Baneh and to substitute for it an administration under a Persian official, supported by a force of gendarmerie of Kurds officered by officers of the regular gendarmerie. Since Hama Rashid, if driven out of Baneh, can take refuge in Iraq, the Persian Government has requested the Iraqi Government to arrest him if he crosses the frontier. The Minister without Portfolio of the Persian Government is to visit the area to assure the Kurds of the good intentions of the Government, but, since the Govern ment has no definite benefits to promise, and since, even if they had, the Kurds have little faith in Persian promises, his visit is likely to be of limited value. 7. There is some credible evidence that Hama Rashid is acting in agreement with Qazi Muhammad of Mahabad, who is popularly supposed to be the centre of the Kurdish independence movement in Persia. It is definitely known that there is in Mahabad much talk of Kurdish independence and an absence of any sign of recognition by the Kurds of Persian authority. As reported in Summary No. 35/44. paragraph 9, the Russians are suspected of encouraging this movement. : There are reports that Russian officers visited Hama Rashid in the latter half j of August; and Soviet officials in Kermanshah and Tehran have immediately I shown a lively interest in, and some disapproval of, the operations now in progress. Khuzestan. 8 . The Bani Turuf are shortly to be invited to surrender their arms on the assurance that one-third of the number they now possess will be returned to reliable chiefs on licence. The invitation is to be backed up by a show of force. The local civil and military Persian authorities are confident that there will be no general disturbance. Russian Affairs. 9. The Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs, M. Kavtaradzeh (see Summary No. 36/44, paragraph 7), has made it known to the Persian Government that he is here for the purpose of negotiating a concession for the exploitation of oil in the Semnan area. The prospect of having a Soviet Government concern established in Persia has filled the Persian Government with great alarm. 10. In addition to a hospital, the opening of which was reported in Summary No. 35/44, paragraph 14, the Russians have now opened a school in Tabriz. While it is said to be principally for children of Russian subjects, it has been announced that Persian children will also be accepted, without fees. The curriculum has been designed for a course of study of ten years; the principal language will be Turki, with Russian, Persian and English as subsidiary languages; the teachers will be Soviet Azerbaijanis. For neither the hospital nor the school was the permission of the Persian Government asked, and insult has been added to injury by establishing Turki as the principal language. In Meshed the Russians have opened classes for the teaching of Russian to Persians. These classes are being attended by some 300 Persians. 11. A very active Russian intriguer, Marchenko, who was vice-consul at Tabriz, has recently arrived in Isfahan as vice-consul. While in Tabriz he was &lt;A 3 shameless in his interference in Persian affairs, unco-operative with his British colleague, and undistinguished for any pro-British sentiments. American Affairs. 12.

The Russian demand for a concession for the right to explore for oil in ISorth Persia dominates the political mind of the capital. The effects on Persia’s integrity of the political results that would follow on the invasion of the area in question, which extends from Azerbaijan to Quchan, by an army of Soviet Government officials in the guise of technical experts occupying the places left vacant on the withdrawal of Soviet troops, are widely appreciated; and there is fairly general approval of the Government’s reply to the Soviet representative, Kavtaradzeh, to the effect that it had been decided to postpone decision on the several applications for concessions for the exploitation of oil until after the war. There are, however, not a few who regard this defiance as dangerous temerity, likely to provoke disagreeable retaliation, a fear which Soviet officials have not failed, to exploit; and in the press there is not only an absence of the hostile criticism that was directed against the British and American competitors for concessions but, in certain ‘papers supported by the Russians or inspired for the occasion, much argument as to the necessity for restoring the balance in foreign relations, upset by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concession in the south, by granting to the Russians a concession in the north; other articles, clearly not written by Persians, would represent the Russian demand as having been dictated not at all in the interests of Russia, Russia having no need of more oil, but solely by the Soviet Government’s generous desire to do good to Persia by helping her to develop her resources and to provide profitable employment for her people; others, again, accuse the Persian Government of having been actuated by hostility to Russia in their decision, since they had been considering for months past applications for concessions from British and American companies without coming to the conclusion that a reply should be deferred until after the war. 2 . It is possible that laqizadeh, the Persian A.mbassador m London now on a visit to Tehran, may become Prime Minister in the near future. He is held in good repute in the country; but his reputation is founded on his career of some years past, since when he has been absent from Persia. His appointment would, it seems, be unwelcome to the Russians since their subsidised Persian press is now warning the public that he has been brought to Persia by the same influences that brought Seyyid Zia to serve the purpose in which they now realise that Seyyid Zia cannot succeed. Taqizadeh has a reputation for patriotism, and he would not be as compliant with Russian desires in such matters as oil concessions as their candidate for the premiership, Qavam es Sultaneh. [59—28] //Nr li;c\ i'2 * * 3. Some embarrassment has been caused to the Government and some resentment in the Court by Dr. Millspaugh’s summary dismissal, without previous consultation with the Government, of the Governor of the National Bank, an influential and outstanding personality who stands well with the Court. The Government has decided that the dismissal was not within Dr. Millspaugh’s competence—a decision which has given much pleasure to Dr. Millspaugh’s many enemies and has not enhanced his prestige or his reputation for political wisdom. 4. In Persia the war in Europe now takes second place in popular interest to the conflict that Persians are now convinced is taking place between British and Russian policies—in Poland, in the Balkans, in Persia. In Persia they think they see the British, struggling to preserve the appearance of concord with their powerful ally, yielding, as little as may be perhaps, to Russian anti-British aggressiveness. Attacks on British policy in certain Persian papers are well known to have been inspired by the Russians; and the nature of the enquiries made by Soviet officials of Persian officials leaves no doubt of the discord between Russian and British policies in Persia. 5. Sartip Abdullah Hidayet, Under-Secretary of State for War, has been appointed Acting Minister for War. Economic. 6 . Dr. Millspaugh has issued a circular instruction to all Ministries notifying them that the special powers given to him in economic and financial matters will in future be exercised under the general supervision of the Minister of Finance. All regulations and correspondence on matters of policy will be signed jointly by Dr. Millspaugh as Administrator-General of the Finances and by the Minister of Finance. 7. The Government has approved the grant of a credit of 1 million rials to the Ministry of the Interior for the reform and improvement of prisons. 8 . Some progress has been made with the distribution of monopoly goods— cloth, tea and sugar—in tribal areas. Over 100,000 rations were distributed to the Qashgai; 200,000 rations were available for distribution to the Bakhtiari, but lack of cash prevented the tribesmen from taking more than 60,000. Distribution has also been made in Khuzestan on a wide scale and in Luristan, and it is hoped that a beginning will shortly be made with the Kurds. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 9. His Majesty’s Consul-General in Azerbaijan reports that during a recent tour west of Lake Rezaieh he found generally a much healthier atmosphere as regards the Kurds. There was evidence of some slight recognition on their part of Persian authority and of an increasing realisation of the possibility of its re-establishment throughout Kurdish territory. Kurds were talking of the necessity of finding a modus vivendi with the Persian authorities, and some Kurds spontaneously expressed loyalty to the Persian Govei'innent. Qazi Muhammad of Mahabad, who has been credited with being the protagonist of the Kurdish independence movement in those parts, admitted that all Kurds did not want independence; many would be content with an administration that gave them some consideration : schools where Kurdish would be allowed, health services, better communications; in general more positive help from Government combined with some degree of autonomy in purely local affairs. The improvement in local atmosphere the consul-general attributes partly to an apparent cessation in Soviet political activity and partly to the personality of the Military Governor-General, Colonel Darakshani. 10. In the Mahabad area the Kurds were said to be fairly orderly, but further north the Jalali, Herki and Shakak were being a pest to their settled neighbours. The Russian authorities had at last agreed to the location of 300 troops at Maku and to their employment for the protection of villages against marauding Kurds. 11. There is no further news from Baneh, nor is it known where Hama Rashid has taken refuge. The Minister without portfolio, Fahimi, is due in Baneh shortly with supplies of tea, sugar and cloth. He will make recommenda tions to Government regarding the future administration of Baneh district. Qazi Muhammad and other chiefs of the Mahabad district have been summoned to Tehran for a conference with the Government, whose intentions as regards the Kurds are benevolent, although they may not have the capacity to translate them into practice nor the power to control the rapacity of their local officials.3 South Persia. 12 . 1 he downward migration of the tribes has begun, accompanied in the case of the Qashgai, according to reports, by a good deal of levying of tribute from villages. Some 500 families of the Darashuri sub-tribe of the Qashgai are to remain for the winter in their summer quarters in the Semirum area. Whether ^t-his will lead to their permanent settlement in that area and be the beginning of ^H^e sedentarisation of the tribe is not yet known; but their presence in that area ~nould serve to check the Boir Ahmadi raiding that usually takes place when the Qashgai leave their summer quarters. Russian Affairs. 13. I he Soviet authorities are again demanding large quantities of rice from the Persian Government, for which they offer to barter cotton piece-goods and miscellaneous articles. In a similar transaction last year the Persian Government lost heavily, but if they refuse to accommodate the Soviet authorities this year the latter will obtain the rials to pay for the rice by selling piece-goods ; and other goods on the black market. The Soviet has already obtained rials by selling at high prices on the black market sugar and tyres, commodities which they obtain from the Allies on Lease-Lend. Needless to say no customs duty is paid on any of the goods imported by the Soviet authorities for sale on the Persian market. 14. Iransovtrans, the Russian transport organisation corresponding to the U.K.C.C., have now ceased their commercial activities (see Summary No. 35/44, paragraph 14) owing to a drop in freights which has made operation unprofitable. Apart from any political intention they may have had in extending Soviet organisations into South Persia, their main object was to obtain rials. The vehicles used were either Lease-Lend trucks or vehicles hired from Persian owners. They ignored all the rules of the Persian Road Transport Department. 15. His Majesty’s Consul-General in Azerbaijan, after a recent tour west of Lake Rezaieh, reports that there is now much less evidence of Russian political activity among the Kurds. The local Governor-General was positive that the Russians were not now encouraging Kurdish lawlessness. This improvement may be due to a change in the personnel of the Soviet Consulate at Rezaieh, the new consul showing some evidence of a desire to be helpful to the Persian Adminis tration. Three hundred Persian troops had been allowed to Maku to protect the villages against Kurdish brigandage. 16. A Tudeh party demonstration took place in Rezaieh during the consul- general’s visit. It was attended by some 2,500 people, mostly Assyrians and Armenians, and was orderly and dull. The party claims to have 12,000-14,000 members in the Rezaieh area. 17. Some 2,000 Russian troops arrived in Meshed on the 7th October. See also Summary No. 36/44, paragraph 8 , which reported the departure of a considerable number of troops from Meshed for Russia.

J Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 40 for the Period \§th-22nd October, 1944. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE Russians are trying in a variety of ways to frighten the Prime Minister, the Deputies and the people into reversing the decision of the Govern ment that no concessions for the exploitation of oil should be given until after the war. The greater part of the Tehran press has been mobilised, not only those papers previously dependent on Russian support. The Tudeh press had some difficulty in wriggling out of the position it had adopted, before Kavtaradzeh appeared on the scene, towards the granting of concessions. It explained, however, that its opposition was only to concessions that might allow foreigners to exercise influence injurious to the integrity and economy of Persia. The war of nerves has been prosecuted by parading through the streets of Tehran lorry loads of menacingly armed Russian soldiers and by plain threats to prominent Persians and, delivered by the Soviet Ambassador himself, to the few editors who had ventured to support the Government. Rumours are being circulated to the effect that Russia is on the point of breaking off relations; Persians are urged to remember the fate of Finland; the Russian press has claimed that the whole Persian press and public opinion are in favour of accepting Russia’s generous offer (in fact, the Russians have as yet given no indication of the terms they are j prepared to offer); and a broadcast from the Tehran Broadcasting Station, sponsored nominally by the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society, was used mainly to give extracts from the Russian-inspired Persian press hostile to the Government’s decision. 2 . Public opinion generally does, in fact, support the Government’s decision, but few Persians have the courage to give their support openly. Great Britain, it is hoped, will intervene and save Persia from having to choose between the unpleasant alternatives of surrendering her northern provinces to Russia or incurring Russian hostility. The Shah is reported to be determined to stand firm, and the Prime Minister will probably do so; but a very violent and venomous campaign is being waged against him in the Persian press that is under Russian influence. He is accused of following a one-sided policy in foreign affairs, of being hostile to Russia and of trying to wreck Russo-Persian relations. In a speech in the Majlis he claimed that the decision to postpone consideration of the granting of oil concessions until after the war had been taken by the Council of Ministers before the arrival of Kavtaradzeh. as was recorded in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting. [59—67] X'2 Economic. 3. Certain changes have lately been made in the Cereals and Bread Regula tions, of which the effect is to— (a) Give higher exemptions to the smaller landlords. (b) Exempt the peasants completely. (c) Remove all restrictions on the transport of grain. These modifications have been made partly because of political pressure, but they can be justified by the improvement in the general situation as regards cereals, which may be summarised as—■ (i) The possession by the Government of considerable reserves of grain. (ii) The decreasing tendency to hoard resulting from favourable war news. (iii) The recent falls in the price of grain on the free market. It is expected that the result of permitting the free transport of grain, combined with the fall in prices due to the unloading of hoarded stocks, will be to increase the supply of grain on the free markets in towns, thus lightening the Government’s task of collection and distribution. The Government hopes to be able to control the price on the free market by issues from the stocks obtained i from the collection of landlords’ surpluses. If present trends continue the ! Government hopes to hold at the end of the current harvest year stocks of 150,000 tons of grain. 4. Colonel Mahmud Khosrovani of the Persian air force has been selected as an additional representative of the Persian Government at the International Air Conference to be held in America in November (see Summary No. 38/44, . paragraph 8 ). Colonel Khosrovani has already been in America purchasing aircraft and made profits from that transaction which were considered to be . scandalous even in Persia. 5. The Red Lion and Sun (the Persian Red Cross) Society announces that it has received subscriptions of 600,000 rials for the relief of the inhabitants of Baneh who have suffered from the maladministration of Hama Rashid. Of this amount, the sum of 400,000 rials is said to have been subscribed by officers of the army. Persian Forces. A rmy. 6 . The debate on the Bill for the grant of an additional credit of 15 million tomans to the army especially for the purpose of increasing the pay of officers has shown little opposition to the Bill in principle, nor has it evoked much criticism of the army. Of several amendments proposed, all were rejected except that for the formation of a special court of two military officers and three judges to investigate the misappropriation of army funds* and certain offences 'of dereliction of duty alleged to have occurred at the time of the entry of Allied troops into Persia in 1941. The debate is not yet finished. A Tudeh Deputy took strong exception to a recent order by the' Ministry for War forbidding officers to join political parties or to take part in politics. 7. During a debate in the Majlis certain remarks made by the Acting Minister for War concerning the army’s special relation to the Shah evoked an emotional protest from the Deputy, Dr. Musaddiq, who, while asserting that he was more devoted to the Shah than anyone else in the Majlis, felt bound to maintain that, since the Shah carried no responsibility, he had no right to interfere in the affairs of any department of Government. Internal Security. 8 . It has been decided in principle to apply the Military Government Law to offences committed on the railway and on certain roads with a view to speeding up the trial of offences against Allied property and legalising the imposition of more severe sentences. Kurdistan. 9. The following information has been given by the Persian General Staff :— Hama Rashid has taken refuge in Iraq and from there he has made several incursions into Persian territory which have resulted in clashes with Persian columns and casualties to both sides, including one of Hama Rashid’s brothers. The Persian forces are, however, in effective occupation of the Baneh and3 Merivan areas Important chiefs, such as Suleiman Jaf and his two sons and the chiefs of the Mangur, have visited the Persian commander at Baneh and promised their co-operation against Hama Rashid, who had made himself unpopular by his exactions. He had destroyed almost everything in Baneh except the mosques before he fled. The people are gradually returning to their homes. The Minister without Portfolio and one of the Kurdish Deputies in the Majlis are due at Baneh on the 22nd October and they will distribute tea, sugar and cloth which has been provided by the Government. The Persian General Stall will be glad if a British official would visit the area to see conditions. Since it seemed unlikely that the Iraqi Government would co-operate to the extent of rounding up Hama Rashid and his followers if they remained in Iraq territory, the Persian Government had had to decide to maintain garrisons of all arms m Baneh and Merivan during the winter. Khuzestan. 10 . Three columns of Persian troops are now moving to positions of tactical importance on the outskirts of the Beni Turuf country preparatory to a summons being given to the tribe to surrender its arms. If the summons is obeyed the troops will take no action. The Beni Turuf Arabs are believed to possess about 2,500 rifles, of which about 800 will be returned to them for their own protection. Kuh-i-Galu. 11. It is reported that all the Boir Ahmadi winter quarters are now occupied by the opponents of Abdullah Zarghampur with the exception of Pili, a^ rather important tactical point, which is occupied by Abdullah himself. Khosrow, his brother and enemy, appealed for the assistance of Persian aircraft to drive out Abdullah, but this request was refused. Relations between Abdullah and Nasir Qashgai are reported to be deteriorating. Nasir is playing for his own hand and Government approval. Fars. % 12. Nasir Qashgai has found that his position in Fars and his authority in the Qashgai tribes are weakening. He has written to the Government to the 1 effect that, if it is desired that he and his brothers should maintain order in the I tribe, he must be given material and moral support against' Kalantars of sub tribes who are now questioning his authority. He suggests that one of his brothers should live in Tehran and that, of himself and the others, one should be with the tribe and one in Shiraz. The Government is in something^ of a quandary. Qashgai lawlessness is increasing, whether instigated by Nasir or not, but the Government forces are not yet ready to assume direct responsibility for maintaining order in the tribe. To give Nasir official recognition and support as being responsible for the behaviour of the whole tribe is tantamount to recognising him as Ilkhani—a retrograde measure which the Persian Government has been trying to avoid. Russian Affairs. 13. A team of Soviet footballers is now in Tehran to play a series of matches. Few personages, however important, have been so greatly feted or been given so much publicity. 14. The Soviet exploration of South Persia, to which reference has been made in previous summaries, continues. A party of Red Army officers has recently been making investigations, of a nature not yet ascertained, in the Zahidan area and along the Zahidan-Birjand road.

Tehran, 3(PA October, 1944. Enclosure. (Secret.) Military Attache’s Intelligence Summary No. 41 for the Period 23nf October to the 2S)th October, 1944. Political. Persian Affairs. 1. The Eussians have continued their campaign of would-be intimidation of the Persian Government and Majlis. The journalists of Tehran, with a few exceptions, were invited to the Soviet Embassy and there entertained by M. Kavtaradzeh with an exposition of the altruistic motives that had induced the Soviet Government to offer to exploit Persia’s oil and of the advantages— in no case precisely defined—that would accrue to Persia; with veiled threats; and with an attack on the head of their Government with whom, M. Kavtaradzeh said, the Soviet authorities could have no further relations, although they still cherished the same warm feelings towards the Persian people whom M. Sa’ed was attempting to mislead. The newspapers, supported by the Eussians, have increased the violence of their attacks on the Prime Minister, accusing him of deliberately trying to embroil Persia with Eussia. They remind their readers that those who opposed the Soviet are to-day being destroyed by the guns of the Eed army; that Eussia will have much to do with the settlement at the Peace Conference of the conditions of the post-war world. Quite inconsistently with their expressions of regard for the welfare of the Persian people the Soviet authorities have stopped the transport by rail of all grain to the capital from the over-stocked granaries of the north. What was perhaps meant to be a master stroke of the offensive was the organisation of a demonstration outside the Majlis building by a crowd of some 4,000 to 5,000 workers and others, calling death to the Prime Minister. The demonstrators, some, at least, of whom are known to have been collected in Soviet lorries from their homes with the promise of reward, were quite openly shepherded and protected by Eussian troops, well armed. 2. The results of this campaign are not what the Eussians expected. It has. indeed, made the Eussians look rather ridiculous in Persian eyes. It has rallied increasing support, even of former critics, to the Prime Minister. The crudity of the methods used, the offence to all recognised international conven tions in Kavtaradzeh’s public attempt to browbeat the press into attacking the Prime Minister have hardened public opinion against Eussia and aroused some thing of those latent qualities of passive resistance that forced Nasiruddin Shah to cancel the concession given to Tobacco Eegie. Newspapers not accepting Eussian money have come out with some almost defiant articles; and the skv has not fallen. Persians who considered that the greatest danger from the Eussians lay in their insidious propaganda and their appeal to the lower classes T59—871FT: 2 ‘ now find cause for more confidence in the future since they hold the view that even the common people are being antagonised by Russia's obvious attempts to bully. 3. In his interview with the journalists—referred to in paragraph 1— Kavtaradzeh stated :—■ (a) That the Soviet Government wished to obtain a concession for the exploration for oil in the provinces of Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazanderan, part of the region of Semnan and some parts of Khorassan. (b) After the necessary surveys had been made in this area to establish where oil existed, the concession would be restricted to a definitely limited region. (It is known from other sources that this area may extend to 150,000 square kilom.) (c) The Soviet Government would pay royalties according to production and a sum to be agreed upon in lieu of customs dues, and would supply Persia’s needs in oil products. (d) At the end of the period of the concession all constructions and installa tions would be surrendered to the Persian Government. (e) Employment would be found for thousands of Persian workmen, particu larly for those who had helped in the transport of supplies to Russia. (/) Persians would be trained in all the technical branches of oil production. (g) During the preliminary geological survey it might be expected that other mineral resources would be discovered which would be of benefit to Persia. (h) The Soviet Government would accept responsibility for the medical care of all employees and their families. (f) The Prime Minister in preliminary discussions had expressed his approval in principle of the Soviet proposals. His subsequent refusal to grant any concessions for oil until after the war had been badly received by the Soviet authorities and his attitude would lead to a deterioration in Russo-Persian relations. 4. Elsewhere the Russians have accused the Prime Minister of having been aware of the purpose of Kavtaradzeh’s mission and of having approved of it before his arrival in Persia. It is believed that the explanation given by the Soviet Embassy of the object of Kavtaradzeh’s mission when it was first proposed to the Persian Government was that it was to discuss the old Khurian oil concession in which the Soviet Government had some share, and to obtain information about mines m North Persia. The Prime Mhmster, m an interview given to the press, stated that this was his understanding and that as soon as the matter of a new concession was mentioned he had informed Kavtaradzeh that the Government had already decided to give no concessions until after the war. 5. The press states that the American Ambassador has written to the Pei sian Government confirming that no promise of a concession had been given to the representative of any American oil company, and that he considered that the Persian Government was fully justified in postponing a decision until after the war. 6. Dr. Millspaugh has apparently refused to accept the decision of the Government that his dismissal of the Governor of the National Bank was ultra vires as, subsequent to that decision, he notified all other banks and departments of the Government that Ibtehaj’s signature on official documents was not valid. 7. Hassan Taqizadeh, Persian Ambassador in London, has left Tehran on his return to England. Attacks on him continued in the Soviet inspired press up to the time of his departure. 8. Majid Ahi, Persian Ambassador in Moscow, has arrived in Tehran on a visit. 9. The Minister of Roads and Communications, Mahmoud Nariman has resigned as a protest against the Prime Minister’s decision that M Hussein Nafisi, who had been dismissed from the post of Director-General of Railwavs should be reinstated. ^ ’ Persian Forces. A rmy. 10. The Bill for the grant of an additional credit of 15 million tomans to the army was passed by a substantial majqrity. An addition made to the Bill was that the period of service for graduates and licentiates should be reduced to one year (see also Summary No. 40/44, paragraph 6)3 A 'ppointments — Military. H.—(i) SarLashkar Hassan Arfa (E.O. 30; M.A. 37) to be a Military G-oyernor for the purpose of applying military law to offences committed on the railway and on certain roads not yet specified (see Summary No 40/44 paragraph 8). ^ (jj-) ^ ar ^P Assadullah Gulshayan to be acting commander of the 2nd (Tehran) Division. (m) Sarlashkar Amanullah Jahanbam (F.O. 103; M.A. 132i to command the officers’ cadet school. 12. Sarlashkar Ahmad Nakchevan (F.O. 159; M.A. 193), commanding the Persian Air Force, has left Tehran to visit England at the invitation of the Air Ministry. He is accompanied by Colonel Bayendor, Persian Air Attache in London, who has been in Tehran on a short visit. Internal Security. Fars. 13. The Governor-General of Fars, appreciating that the forces at his disposal are not yet capable of controlling the increasing disorder among the Qashgai, has recommended to the Government that Nasir Qashgai should be officially recognised as responsible for the maintenance of order in the tribe, and that for this purpose he should be allowed to draw p&amp;y from the Government for about 100 riflemen. The Governor-General argues that Nasir, as a Government official appointed to keep order in the tribe, is not likely to make himself so popular that there would be any difficulty in evicting him when the time came. To judge by the parallel case of Morteza Quli Bakhtiari, this seems at least a possibility. Kurdistan. 14. No further reports of encounters between Persian troops and Hama Rashid’s followers have reached Tehran. A British officer is visiting Baneh to see conditions for himself at the invitation of the Persian General Staff. Conversations are taking place between local Persian military officers and Iraqi officials with a view to inducing the Iraqi authorities to take action, if not against Hama Rashid himself, against his family and property now in Iraq territory. According to Persian reports the Iraqi authorities show no disposition to co-operate. Baluchistan. 15. Some time ago a certain Baluch, Madad Ali, a mullah living in the neighbourhood of Bazman, 70 miles north-west of Iranshahr, set himself up as a prophet, collected a number of followers, and started a reign of terror, murdering several persons who ventured to oppose him. After some ineffective operations by the gendarmerie, a military column was sent against him, which killed the prophet and dispersed his followers. Russian Affairs. 16. A modification is required in paragraph 14 of Summary No. 39/44. Iransovtrans are continuing their commercial operations in the so-called Russian zone.

Tehran. §th November. 1944. 125 Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 42 for the period the 30£A October to the 5th November, 1944. (Secret.) *— Persian Affairs. Political. 1. Until the middle of the week Russian incitement of the press and the Tudeh party to agitate in favour of the granting to Russia of a concession for the exploitation of oil continued. Demonstrations were organised in Tabriz, Ardebil, Qasvin, Resht, Bandar Shah, Pahlevi, Meshed, Isfahan and Sultanabad —that is, wherever the Tudeh party had the necessary influence. In Tabriz the mob tried to rush the police headquarters and was fired on, one man being killed and a few wounded. Russian troops intervened and allowed neither the police nor Persian military patrols to interfere with the mob; moreover, they prohibited the carrying of arms in the town by any member of the Persian forces, and officers carrying arms were prevented from leaving their barracks. The com mander of the Persian troops was given twenty-four hours to leave the town. At Resht also the Persian police were similarly prevented from taking any measures to restore order. In Isfahan and Sultanabad, where there are no Russian troops, the demonstrations were tame and the small crowds, who when they were first collected had no idea that they were to demonstrate in favour of an oil concession to the Russians, soon dispersed. From the other towns concerned reports have not yet been received. 2. Towards the end of the week, however, there were indications that the Russians were shifting their ground, perhaps even seeking means of easing the difficult situation they had created by breaking off relations with the Persian ‘ Government. They have perhaps realised that, not only are the mass of the Persian people opposed to the granting of this oil concession, but that they were being antagonised and disillusioned, where there had been illusion, by the methods adopted by the Russians. Twenty-eight of the newspapers published in Tehran, including most of the less disreputable ones, have announced their support of the Prime Minister’s policy. In spite of the rigorous refusal of the Russian members of the Allied censorship to allow the despatch of any messages giving the Persian Government’s version of the matter, the Persian case has been published in London, and this may have had something to do with the change of tone of the Soviet authorities. The Soviet Embassy has perhaps realised that it is unlikely that any Prime Minister dare now suggest compliance with the Russian demand, and that may be wdiy Russian propaganda has now changed its tone. It has ceased to lay stress on the advisability of the Soviet being given the oil concession. Russian displeasure is represented as being, not with the Government’s decision to postpone consideration of applications for oil concessions until after the war, but with the Prime Minister’s alleged pre varications. Russia, it is said, had asked for this concession to prevent Sa’ed giving it into hands that might prove dangerous to Russia in the future. [59—88]Sa’ed’s policy seemed to be to facilitate the establishment in Persia of a base for fascist aggression against Russia. Persians must realise that Russia would not allow Persia again to be a link in the chain of hostile countries that the capitalist Powers had tried to put around Russia after the Revolution. It was only the presence of Sa’ed as Prime Minister that prevented the removal of all misunderstandings. Sa’ed was completely under the influence of Seyyid Zia, j whose partial policy was notorious. It is perhaps still too early to say that ! the Russians are prepared to swallow the rebuff over the oil concession and that, &lt; realising that they are losing ground with the Persian people, they would be glad to resume relations with the Persian Government if Sa’ed could be got rid of; but there are indications of a tendency that way. More concrete evidence of a change of attitude is that they have now promised to allot wagons for the jtransport by rail of about 3,500 tons of grain from the north; and that they I cancelled a further demonstration which was being prepared for Friday, the 3rd November. This decision may, however, have been influenced by a proclamation by the Military Governor forbidding the assembly in public of more than three persons. 3. In the Majlis there is a certain amount of opinion in favour of Sa’ed’s resigning so that relations can be reopened with the Russians. Meetings of representatives of Majlis groups have been held to decide who should be his successor. Dr. Musaddiq is favoured by the majority; but being a Deputy he cannot, according to the law, become a minister unless he resigns his seat. He is willing to become I lime Minister as a temporary measure, provided some method can be found of legalising his resumption of his seat as a Deputy when he withdraws from the Premiership, i here is some talk of bringing in a Bill that will prohibit the Government from giving any concessions until after the v» ai. It is argued that after the passing of such a law Sa’ed could resign without giving the impression that he had been obliged to do so through lack of support for his policy. 4. On the 29th October the Deputy, Dr. Musaddiq, made a very lengthy speech m the Majlis which created some impression. His purpose was to show that it was not in the interests of Persia that oil concessions should be given to any foreigners since they upset the political balance and did not profit Persia ^ extent proportionate to their value. He went over a lot of old history; claimed that the reason why the Russians had occupied North 1 eisia m 1941 had nothing to do with the defence of Persia against the Germans but was solely to prevent the British establishing themselves there on some pretext m the vicinity of the Baku oilfields. He reviewed the 1921 Russo-Persian Treaty with favour, and, at great length, the terms of the A.I.O.C. concession which he criticised as being unjust to Persia. He blamed the Prime Minister for having aallied so long with the American concession-hunters and for not announcing earlier the decision of the Government to postpone consideration of the grant ot concessions until after the war. It was natural that the Russians who^were their neighbours, believing that the Government was considering the grant of a concession to the Americans should themselves apply for a concession The Soviet Government could say one of two things : either that the concession for the northern provinces should be given to them to balance the concession given to the A.I.O.C.; or that Russia needed the concession because she needed oil In th f j™ 9 as ^ the Ma J lls wouM certainly not approve. In the second case he urged that the Government should reply that an international company composed of Persians and a limited number of foreign shareholders should be formed to exploit the northern oilfields and that the Government should undertake to sell for a period to be settled by agreement, the surplus oil of the northern fields’. o. Ihe Tudeh party has published a lengthy manifesto giving the aims of the party in general and in particular as regards workers, peasants; intellectuals women, tribes, education and health, finance and economics. Among the nolitical aims are: the independence and integrity of Persia; democracy; co-operation with all freedom-loving countries; freedom of thought, speech and pen- educational and religious freedom for minorities; electoral reform- the suppression of corruption in the police and gendarmerie. For the workers it envisages a U topia to be achieved through legislation. For the peasant it demands an extension of peasant proprietorship by the distribution of Government lands * k?- f k the P ro P ert y of , Iar £ e landowners; loans of money and machinery the establishment of schools and hospitals; the improvement of irrigation- the revision of laws governing the proportion of the crop to be given by 'the peasant to the landowner For women it aims at the right to vote in elections to local administration, the reform of the divorce laws and the equality of wife and3 husband. In education it demands, besides a fundamental reform of the system, the introduction of political teaching and freedom from censorship of all kinds. It lays stress on the necessity for increased industrialisation and for Government control of economic affairs. Membership of the party is open to all Persian nationals over the age of 20 who accept the principles of the party, with the exception of criminals, persons who co-operated with the old regime and members v 9^ an y 9 tller P art y• Subscriptions vary from 5 rials per month for persons whose income is 1,000 rials per month to 100 rials for persons whose income is 5,000 rials per month. Local committees must meet once a fortnight, and a central congress of members elected from provincial organisations will be held yearly. This congress will be the supreme authority of the party. Youth organisations are to be formed, who will be instructed in Tudeh aims and policy. 6. A step forward has been taken towards the execution of the Law of Compulsory Primary Education, passed by the Majlis in June 1943. A law has now been passed authorising the expenditure of a credit of 50 million rials on the increase of teachers’ emoluments, on assistance to existing schools and on the construction of new schools. Further, the Government is to draft a ten-year plan for the construction or purchase of buildings for new primary schools in the capital and the provinces. The Ministry of Education undertakes to co-operate with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in providing facilities for the education of workers in factories. Economic. 7. A representative of the British engineering firm of Sir Alexander Gibbs and Company has been for some time in Tehran investigating projects for improving the water supply of Tehran. One of these projects is to bring the water of the Lar River, which flows into the Caspian, to Tehran by tunnelling a canal through the watershed. Another, and much less ambitious, project, which is, however, only a partial solution, is to improve the canal that now brings water from the Kerej River so as to reduce wastage. 8. The Persian representatives to attend the Trade Conference in America have left Tehran. They are Dr. Ali Akbar Akhavi, Ahmad Akhavan and Qazizadeh. Persian Forces. 9. Two commissions have been formed to enquire into the accounts of the Ministry for War. One will investigate the accounts for twenty years previous to August 1941; the other the accounts subsequent to that time.' The present Acting Minister for War and Chief of the General Staff hope thereby to embarrass senior officers and other rivals who might return to the Shah’s favour and oust them from their positions.

It has been decided to enlist 100 Bakhtiari tribesmen into the gendarmerie for service in Bakhtiari only. They will be armed, clothed and equipped on the usual gendarmerie scale. The bulk of them will be stationed at Deh Diz for the control of Bahmai and Taibi raiding; some will be at the service of the Governor to maintain order in the Bakhtiari tribe. Kermanshah. 12. Decorations and rewards have been distributed by the Persian military authorities to the Jawanrudi tribesmen who co-operated in the operations against the Rashid brothers (see Summary No. 35/44, paragraph 11).

It is reported that the Sheikhs of the Beni Turuf, when summoned to surrender their arms, agreed to do so, and that 250 rifles have already been handed in without it having been necessary for the Persian army to take any forcible measures.Russian Affairs, 14. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that Soviet activities in Khorassan as regards propaganda, cultural work, support of workers’ movements and military measures, allegedly for security, have greatly increased lately. 15.

The Russians having to all appearances dropped their demand for an oil concession—In fact, going so far as to pretend that that demand never was the important matter at issue but only Sa’ed’s persistently anti-Russian policy—those timorous people, who include the Shah, his intimate advisers, with the exception of the Minister of the Court and many Deputies, who feared that their private interests might be affected by the prolongation of the crisis in Russo-Persian relations and who desired a concilia tory gesture that would make it possible for the Russians to re-establish relations with the Persian Government, prevailed on Sa’ed to resign. 2. Unless the Russians are very ill-informed, they must know that by his refusal of their demand Sa’ed has greatly increased his prestige and is, in fact, j a minor national hero; not only that, but that Persian opinion was for the most part strongly opposed to the grant of a concession to the Soviet Government; that world opinion has not been misled b)^ the artificial demonstration of hirelings, nor by the inspired clamour of a certain section of the press; and that not only have they had a considerable rebuff, but also that the Tudeh party is greatly discredited, having plainly shown itself to all to be nothing more than an organisation for the furtherance of Soviet policy in Persia. Moreover, the leaders of the party have realised that their Russian connexion is no guarantee of security; the leading papers of the party have been suppressed, its head quarters occupied by Persian troops and some of the leaders arrested. Persians may well wonder what services the Soviet Ambassador and the Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs have rendered to Russia to merit the decorations whose award to them has recently been announced. 3. In broadcasts from Moscow, in the Russian press and in the Russian- inspired Persian press malignant attacks on Sa’ed continued. The similarity of the articles in the Russian and Persian press left no doubt as to their common origin. They included a certain amount of propaganda to the effect that it was only to Russia that the Persian people could look with confidence for protection against colonising Powers and against exploitation. The Izvestiya gave as proof of Sa’ed’s treachery to his country that he allowed American troops to remain in Persia without any treaty right whatsoever. Reuter’s and the B.B.C. were attacked for attempting to mislead world opinion by suggesting that Sa’ed had the support of public opinion in Persia. Certain Persian papers ventured to ‘[60-24]2 publish criticisms of Russian policy, usually offering, however, to make allowances for the apparent fact that the Soviet Embassy had been misled as to public opinion by its false Persian friends. One paper published what it claimed was the gist of a letter written by President Roosevelt affirming America’s concern for the integrity of Persia and promising that America’s treatment of Persia would be a model for all big Powers in their dealings with small nations. The editor of the paper claims that such a letter was written, but some time ago. to General Hurley, in acknowledgment of his report to the President on his visit to Persia, and that it was shown to the Persian Embassy in Washington with the President’s permission. 4. The Shah has been considering the despatch of a special mission to Moscow to endeavour to appease the Soviet Government. It is reported that the .members of it would be Ibrahim Zand (F.O. 233), Hamid Sayyah (F.O. 202; M.A. 258), General Yazdan Panah and Muhammad Ali Homayunjah (F.O. 87; M.A. 114), Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, all persons'believed to be pleasing to the Russians. 5. It seems likely that there will be some delay before a new Government is formed. There are at least fifteen willing candidates for the premiership. Dr. Musaddiq appears to have the largest support in the Majlis, but no way has yet been found to satisfy his condition that he should be allowed to retain a lien on his seat in the Majlis. I'ailing him, the choice of the Deputies at present seems to lie between two elderly gentlemen, Hassan Isfandiari (Muhtashim-es- Sultaneh) (F.O. 99; M.A. 125) and Hussein Sami’i (Adib-es-SuUaneh (F 0 199- M.A. 254).

Internal Security. Ears. 11. It had, it seems, been decided by the Government that they could not go so far as to give to Nasir Qashgai an official decree appointing him Rais-i- Intizamat—that is, the authority responsible for the good behaviour of the Qashgai tribes—but they have agreed that he may be asked to accept that responsibility by the Governor-General of Fars. Whether Nasir will accept this ambiguous position is doubtful. See also Summary No. 41/44. paragraph 13. Kurdistan. 12. A British officer who recently visited Baneh confirms that the village has been almost entirely destroyed, that the inhabitants who had dispersed a?e letuimng, and that the Persian military authorities are doing their best with the small resources at their disposal, to relieve distress.- From Persian sources it is reported that all the Baneh Begzadehs except Hama Rashid and his near relations have returned and made submission; also, that the Iraqi authorities are showing a better disposition to co-operate, which may lead to the arrest of Hama Rashid. I he Persian authorities are anxious to get him out of the way before the winter sets in. Baneh becomes isolated for five to six months from themilitary stations of Saqqiz and Sanandaj when snow has fallen. Consequently, the size of any garrison left in Baneh depends on the amount of supplies that can be stocked there before the passes become snowbound. 13. Qazi Muhammad, the Kurdish notable of Mahabad, who has for some time been suspected of encouraging ideas of Kurdish autonomy and of being in league with the Russians, has arrived in Tehran, accompanied by three chiefs of e langur, one of the Mamesh and one of the Govrik. He is endeavouring to com mee the Persian authorities, as yet with incomplete success, that he is a loyal leisian subject. He has in the past been credited with loyal service to the Government. Russian Affairs. 14. The Soviet Embassy did not hold the anniversary celebration of the October Re\olution as usual on the 7th November. They announced that the money it would have cost would this year be given to Soviet war charities. The reason for not holding the usual reception was that, having announced that they would ha\e no further dealings with Sa ed s Government, they could not invite members of the Cabinet, and, fearing perhaps a boycott in the circumstances by all 1 ei sians except their own stooges, they decided to hold no reception at all. An attempt to organise a demonstration of sympathetic rejoicing on the occasion by the Tudeh party was nipped in the bud by the action of the Military Governor, who dispersed the small crowd that was gathering at the party headquarters ir&gt; defiance of the proclamation forbidding public assembly, occupied the head quarter offices and arrested some of the leaders.

Persia is still without a Government. The Persians take a childish delight in any such “ grown up ” disease as a political crisis. Being indivi dualists without loyalty, discipline or cohesion they are loth to sink their differences, fix upon a common policy and elect leaders to carry out that policy. The Majlis has met in secret or open session almost daily. A Bill to except Dr. Musaddiq (if elected as Prime Minister) from the provisions of the consti tutional laws and to preserve his parliamentary seat against the time when he might resign from the premiership was defeated by 64 votes out of 91 cast. At subsequent meetings of the Majlis groups on the 15th November, Hussein Samii, Adib-us-Saltaneh (F.0.199; M.A. 254) was nominated by the Mihan group; Murteza Quli Bayat (Saham-us-Sultan), F.O. 47; M.A. 65, by the Ittehad i Milli group, and Sadiq Sadiqi (Mushtasha-ud-Dowleh), F.O. 193; M.A. 248, by the Azadi group. The Independents, after some discussion with the other groups, finally advanced three names as candidates for the premiership, Hassan Isfandiari (Muhtashim-us-Saltaneh), F.O. 99; M.A. 125, Sadiq Sadiqi and Samii (Adib-us- Saltaneh). They were subsequently asked to reduce the number of their candi dates to two. Nothing original in the way of a policy or vigour in carrying - it out can be expected from any of the above and the ideas in the minds of the majority of Deputies are probably that after the recent deterioration of Perso- Soviet relations it is essential to choose a Prime Minister who, though he will not give the Russians their concession, will at least not irritate them further nor be a target for their personal animosity as Sa’ed was, and that as long as the war lasts and foreign troops on Persian soil prevent the Persians from being complete masters of their own house no strongly nationalistic policy or vigorous' Prime Minister is indicated or indeed advisable. 2. The Russian-sponsored newspapers and the Freedom Front press have kept up their attacks on Sa’ed, blaming his policy for embittering Perso-Soviet relations, his “ Fascist ' Government for suppressing certain of the Tudeh group of newspapers and for oppressive action against Tudeh demonstrators. &amp; This Persian habit of kicking a man when he is down or continuing to revile him after he has resigned office suits the Russian book as they hope to obscure their recent defeat over the oil concession by a more concentrated attack on Sa’ed for his mistaken policy and past misdeeds which, thev claim, are leadino- the country to ruin. ^ J 3. A further Tudeh demonstration on the 17th November on a small scale and unescorted by Russian troops, was stopped and dispersed by Persian police [60—40 ] *2 and military before the demonstrators had proceeded far. Two lorry-loads of bemused and unenthusiastic demonstrators from Sultanabad arsenal was stopped and turned back some 4 miles north of the town. 4. A society of Ulema has been founded in Tehran. The names of several eminent divines are among its members. Among its objects are the translation of the Koran and famous works on Mohammedan theology and the construction of a hostel for prominent clerics visiting the capital. 5. Sardar Akram, the Governor of Hamadan, has been acquitted by the correctional court of the charges made against him of illegally imprisoning certain people in Hamadan. Appointments — Civil. 6.

Representatives of Great Britain, United States, Russia, Afghanistan and Persia attended. 9. Further good rain has fallen over the northern part of Persia. Persian Forces. 10. The Russians seem to have at last agreed to the despatch of Persian troops to disarm the tribes in the Shirwan and Bujnurd areas. Some 120 infantry under Sarhang Beglari left Meshed on the 20th October for Bujnurd. A com mission composed of a military officer, the farmandar, the public prosecutor and two well-known citizens of each place will be formed to collect arms from the tribes. It is reported that Ali Khan Bicharanlu is already under guard in Meshed and Farajullah Zafaranlu is to be arrested shortly. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 11. There is little news of the operations against Hama Rashid and negotiations with the Iraq Government for his arrest and extradition are still in pi ogress. Hama Rashid s followers are still reported to be engaged in guerrilla u arfare and in harassing the Persian lines of communication to Baneh, where the garrison numbers about 2,000-3,000 men. 12. Distribution of piece-goods (71,005 metres), sugar (100,073 kilog.) and tea (998 kilog.) has been made in some of the rural areas of the Kermanshah governorate by the Cereals and Bread Department. An offer by the Kurdish chiefs to take delivery themselves in Kermanshah and to superintend the distribution was declined. Security—East Persia, 13. Two U.K.C.C. trucks employed on wheat collection were held up by an armed gang about 15 miles north of Zahidan on the 8th November. Of the four Persian drivers and assistants, two were killed and two seriously injured. The robbers carried away the cash and personal belongings of the drivers. A Persian army detachment sent in pursuit has so far failed to contact the robbers. Russian Affairs. A consular report from Meshed states that some eighty Turkoman soldiers of the Red army are said to have deserted and joined the Persian3 Turkoman tribes in the Bujnurd district. The Soviet military authorities approached the Persian General Officer Commanding in Khorassan for assistance in rounding up the deserters. A party of Persian troops, accompanied by a Soviet officer, surrounded the deserters and after a short fight some thirty-three of them were captured.

Tehran, 27th November, 1944. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military Attache’s Intelligence Summary No. 45 for the Period 20 th to 20 th November, 1944. Political. Persian Affairs. 1. At a secret session of the Majlis on the 20th November Mustafa Quli Bayat (Saham-us-Sultan) was elected Prime Minister, receiving fifty votes against forty-five cast for Sadiq Sadiqi (Mushtashar-ud-Dowleh). The latter had pre viously announced his refusal to stand as a candidate for the premiership, but had been prevailed upon to withdraw his objections. Samii (Adib-us-Saltaneh) had also refused to stand for the premiership out of disgust, as some say, at the intrigues now being carried on by the Russians with their proteges among the candidates for Cabinet posts, their jackals among the Deputies and their hire lings among the press. It is more likely that, as a reasonably honest patriot (although without much force of character) he felt himself incapable, if elected, of choosing a Cabinet acceptable to himself, the Majlis and the Russians, to say nothing of the other Allies and the Shah. Bayat was subsequently received in audience by the Shah and instructed to form his Cabinet. This he has at last done, and they were due to be presented to the Shah on the 25th November and to the Majlis on the 26th November. 2. The Cabinet is composed as follows :— Commerce, Industry and Mines : Kamal Hidayat, Hassan Ali fNasr-ul- Mulk. (F.O. 107; M.A. 140.) (C). Minister of State (without portfolio) : Fahimi, Khalil (Fahim-ul-Mulkl (F.O. 59; M.A. 82.) (B). h Finance: Ardalan, Amanullah (Haji Izz-ul-Mamalik) (F O 27- M.A. 33.) (D). ^ ’ Education : Sadiq, Dr. Issa (Sadiq-i-A’lam). (F.O. 192; M.A. 247.) (D) Justice: Adi Mustafa (Mansur-us-Saltaneh). (F.O. 1; M.A. 1.) (D) Minister of State (without portfolio) : Siasi, Ali Akbar. (F.O. 216.) (D) Roads and Communications: Intizam, Nasrullah. (F.O. 92; M.A. 12^ ) Foreign Affairs : Rais, Muhsin. (F.O. 187; M.A. 239.) War : Zand, Ibrahim. (F.O. 233.) (D) Health : Malik, Dr. Said (Luqman-ul-Mulk.) (D) Interior : Sururi, Muhammad. (F.O. 219.) (B) Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones : Arasteh, Nadir. (F.O. 24; M NJ22k [61-8] 1/0,0 Os.-W,... -U*,.'l*‘2 4 r - The Minister of Agriculture has not yet been appointed, Tsuri Isfandiari (Muvaffaq-us-Saltanah) having been offered and having refused the post. . - x' Note.—(A) signifies member of previous Cabinet. (B) signifies member of previous Cabinet in same post. (C) signifies member of former Cabinet. (D) signifies member of former Cabinet in same post. Thus, the only two newcomers to Cabinet rank are Mohsin Rais and Nadir Arasteh. The former is now Persian Ambassador at Bagdad, and the latter has had a long diplomatic career with, in addition, two posts as provincial governor. In general they may be said to be “a decent set ” and more competent than many if given a lead. It was rumoured that the Russians had said they would not accept as a Cabinet Minister any member of Sa’ed’s Cabinet. It is difficult to see on what grounds they can object to the only two of that category, viz., Fahimi and Sururi. The former was a Minister without portfolio and had, moreover, been absent on a special mission in Kurdistan during most of the period of the crisis over the oil concession. Sururi is a promoted Under-Secretary, who has had a purely departmental career and has never dabbled in politics. 3. The Freedom Front (Russian-sponsored) press continue their attacks on Sa’ed. They use three main arguments. To the politically-minded they say that Sa’ed’s policy was one-sided and that, by wilfully estranging the Russians, he has upset the political balance. To the working classes they say that the refusal by Sa’ed to grant a concession has deprived thousands of workers and thousands about to become unemployed on cessation of their work for the Allies’ war effort of the chance of lucrative employment on oil development. To the young intelligentsia they say (though not openly) that the British want this concession for themselves and, if they get it, will employ but few educated Persians, whereas under Russian development, the majority of the educated and more highly paid employees would have been Persians. 4. In the provinces the Russians are as active in their efforts as in the capital. From Azarbaijan it is reported that they convene meetings of various guilds, assemble doctors and approach Kurds and endeavour to get them to send telegrams of protest to Tehran against the non-granting of the concession. They even took the occasion of a meeting of the Perso-Soviet Cultural Society in Tehran to make speeches on this subject till the aged ex-president of the Majlis, Haji Muhtasham-us-Saltaneh, got up and said that such utterances were out of place in a cultural meeting. 5. A press statement gives the numbers of the Majlis parties as follows :— Independents (Mufrid) ... ... ... ... ... 58 National Union (Milli) ... ... ... 30 Fatherland (Watan) ... ... ... ... ... 25 Popular (Tudeh) ... ... ... ... ... ... 8 The Court. 6. The Queen-Mother has left for Egypt to see her fourth child, Prince Ali Reza, who has recently arrived in Cairo from Johannesburg after the death of his father, Reza Shah. 'Malikeh Turan, Reza Shah’s second, and subsequently divorced, consort, left for Cairo some weeks previously to see her only child, Prince Ghulum Reza. It is believed that Ismet-ul-Muluk, Reza Shah’s third consort, will also leave for Cairo in the near future to see her eldest son, Prince Abdur Reza. 7. Workers’ Insurance Regulations have been passed by the Cabinet on the 8th November, 1944. In brief, the regulations apply to the towns of Tehran, Tabriz, Isfahan and Meshed, and provide for— (i) Classification of workers by irades. (ii) Medical examination of workers to decide their physical fitness for their present employment.' (iii) Protection from dangerous machinery, washing facilities, extra milk, suitable clothes, meals, lavatories. (iv) Penalties for infringement by factory owners. (v) Insurance premia vary according to the nature of the trade from 1^ per cent, of the daily wage to 3 per cent., one-third of the premium to be paid by the employer. (vi) Insurance benefits graded according to the degree of disability from death down to minor injuries necessitating temporary stoppage of work:Economic. 8. A new regulation for the monopoly of agriculture has been issued by Dr. Millspaugh. It supersedes the Stabilisation of Prices Regulation No. 140, and is framed to bring under one control the collection, transport, storage and issue of grain, the control of bakeries, and the functions previously performed by ^ the Price Stabilisation Department. Tribal Affairs. Khuzistan. . 9. The Acting Minister for War informed the British Military Attache that up to the 20th November 1,000 rifles had been collected by the columns engaged in disarming the Arabs. One column only, he said, had encountered slight opposition. He said that he hoped the operations would be concluded within a month, as the Ministry for War had no desire to lock up so many troops in that area. (A recent report gives the strength of the Khuzistan Division and its attached troops as 7,555 all ranks.) Kurdistan. 10. Hama Rashid, according to information supplied to the British Military Attache by the Acting Minister for War, surrendered himself on the 18th November to the Kaimakam of Hallabjeh and the Chief of Police of Penjwin. Hama Rashid is said to have proposed the following terms : — (i) His future place of residence to be either Kirkuk or Suleimanieh. (ii) The Persian Government should not hold against him any acts of his subsequent to “ the events of Shahrivar ” (the entry of British and Russian troops into Persia). (iii) No acts of his tribe subsequent to his separation from them to be laid at his door. No mention is made of extradition and the above terms could not be said to be suitable from the Persian Government’s point of view. Meanwhile, negotia tions between the two Governments are in progress in Bagdad. Another agree ment signed, prior to Hama Rashid’s surrender, by Colonel Saqafi, the Persian Liaison Officer, and Sayyid Sidqi, the Iraqi Liaison Officer, provides, inter alia, for the liberation of the'fifteen Jaf tribesmen now in prison, a full enquiry into frontier incidents where the inhabitants have suffered losses from raiders, negotiations between the two Governments for the handing over of Hama Rashid and the provision of safe-conduct for such of his followers who submit to the Persian authorities and desire to return to Persian territory. Russian Interests. 11. A small party of Russian military has arrived at Gunabad. It is believed that they intend to make a reconnaissance of the road Gunabad-Firdaus- Tebas-Yezd.

The Tudeh continue to try and carry out the orders they receive from the Soviet Embassy and the Military Governor continues to resist them. They announced a large meeting at their headquarters for Friday, the 1st December, but the Military Governor forbade entrance to their premises on the score of the recent emergency proclamation banning as unlawful assemblies any meeting of more than three persons. 3. On Friday, the 1st December, a reception was given at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to celebrate the 1st anniversary of the Tehran Conference, and the issue of the statement confirming Persia’s political independence and integrity. 4. On the 2nd December, Dr. Musaddiq entered the Majlis at 9 a.m., and sprung a surprise on the Deputies. He tabled a Bill making it a penal offence for any Prime Minister, Cabinet Minister or government representative to grant any oil concession in Persia at any time to any foreign government or foreign oil company. ,He was successful in obtaining “ double urgency ” procedure for his Bill which was passed at 4 p.m. on the same day. (The full text will be given in next Intelligence Summary.) Dr. Musaddiq was probably induced to take this prompt and extreme action by consideration of what many intelligent Persians have been saying and thinking ever since Sa’ed’s refusal to grant the oil concession produced the rupture in his relations with the Russians. Most Persians have thought that the Russians would not take this lying down and Kavtaradzeh’s continued presence in Tehran supported this view. They agreed that the Shah might be won over or intimidated into promising the concession, that, the Cabinet might be bought or intimated into granting it, that the Russians might object to and overthrow every successive Cabinet which resisted them until government was reduced to impotency. The one body, not from incorruptibility but from its size, its heterogeneous nature and its internal jealousies which could not be bought in its entirety was the Majlis. The Majlis therefore, garrulous, venal and lazy as it was, represented to them the only obstacle in the Russian path. What was more likely than that the Russians would urge the Shah to close the Majlis as a [61—33]2 brake on the government of the country and as a saboteur of every measure of reform? Dr. Musaddiq may have argued thus and seized this moment to record in statute form the opinion of the Majlis. 5. A new governorate of Jahrum in Ears has been formed. It will include the districts of Semkan, Khafar, Kurdijan and Kuhak. A 'ppointments — Civil. 6. Ahmad Divsalar to be acting Governor of Ustan No. 1 (Gilan) vice Nadir Arasteh appointed Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones. Economic. 7. A clause will be inserted in all contracts for labour for the British military authorities whereby the contractor is bound, on the termination of his contract, to transport to their homes any workmen imported from their homes to the place of his contract. Internal Security. Ears. 8. The Governor-General, for some time past, had been toying with the idea of procuring Nasir Khan Qashgai’s election to the vacant Majlis seat of Lar. His objects, he said, were to induce a more stable frame of mind in Nasir and, during his necessarily long absences in Tehran, to allow the influence of the more sensible and tractable Muhammed Hussein Qashgai gradually to oust that of Nasir. As regards the first of Firuz’s objects, it is doubtful whether a sense of his parliamentary responsibilities would effect any lasting change in Nasir’s unstable mentality. The second object seems equally difficult to achieve since Nasir would not be compelled to spend the greater part of his time in Tehran. A Shiraz Deputy, Muaddil, for instance, has not, to date, registered a single attendance in the Majlis since his election. Nasir Khan’s own objects are not difficult to guess. He wants additional representation for his tribe in the Majlis and, should a future government decide to bring him to book for his past misdeeds, he wants parliamentarry immunity. However, Nasir’s schemes have, for the moment, gone agley as Firuz has had instructions from Tehran not to proceed with the election for the vacant seat, the Persian Government not being willing by such action in the South, to provoke similar demands from the North to fill those seats rendered vacant by the rejection of the credentials of the Russian sponsored Tudeh Deputies. 9. Reference Summary No. 44/44, paragraph 17, the Russian who contacted Nasir Khan was not the Soviet Assistant Military Attache but another Russian who had visited Shiraz some ten days previously, though the Soviet Military Attache did evince considerable interest in tribal affairs and attempted to procure from the Governor, his host, a list of the tribes As to the truth of the Russian offer of arms, ammunition and money there is only Nasir Khan’s state ment made to the Governor and to His Majesty’s Consul/ He might well have been trying to increase his own importance or even have been fool enough to think that British fear of such extension of Russian influence in the South might evoke a similar offer from the British. 10. Better security on the roads round Shiraz is reported as the result of a tail-twisting administered by the Governor to Colonel Khosrowdad, the Chief of Gendarmerie of Pars. Mamassani. 11- Hussein Quli Rustam of the Mamassani has made overtures to His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz and has expressed his desire for guidance. If this chieftain, as was reported, is to act as mediator in the dispute between the two Zarghampur cousins, Abdullah and Khosro, this should make for a peaceful outcome. Khuzistan. ♦ 12. The military operations to disarm the Arab tribes have been hampered by rain and the flight of a large number of the Beni Turuf across the border into Iraq. General Homayuni asked His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwmz to intervene with the Iraqi authorities and induce them to disarm or expel the fugitives. He was informed that this was not a matter in which His Majesty’s Consul could properly interfere and that it should be dealt with through diplomatic channels between the Governments of Persia and Iraq.3 Kurdistan. 13. No result has yet been published of the discussions between the Persian and Iraqi Governments for the handing over to the former of Hama Rashid. It is probable that the Iraqi Government may decline to do so on the grounds that they have no extradition treaty with Persia, and that his enforced residence in ^^Iraq at a safe distance from the frontier is, in fact, a better solution both in the interests of the Persian Government and Hama Rashid. Russian Interests. 14. The Tudeh have now opened a branch in the sugar factory at Mervdasht near Persepolis. 15. There is some evidence to show that Russian propaganda in the Persian army is not without its effect. The chief targets are the warrant officers and the junior officers. With the former the line taken is that, as the backbone of the Persian army and as long-service men, they are shamefully underpaid and badly treated. To the young officers the approach is by an appeal to their professional ambition and by urging them to better their own chances of prefer ment and promotion by making a clean sweep of their old, corrupt and useless seniors. 16. On the 28th November a gold and marble plaque was unveiled in the Soviet Embassy to commemorate the Tehran Conference. A long speech was made by the Soviet Ambassador and a short speech in Persian by the Persian Prime Minister. It was worth noting that Sururi, the only Cabinet Minister who was also a member of Sa’ed’s last Cabinet (apart from Fahimi, who is still absent in Kurdistan), was not invited.

Tehran, 11th December, 1944. Enclosure. Military Attache’s Intelligence Summary No. 47 for the period Mh December to 10th December, 1944. (Secret.) Political. Persian Affairs. 1. Dr. Musaddiq’s Bill prohibiting the discussion of oil concessions by any member of the Government with the representative of any foreign Govern ment or company (for the text see the appendix to this summary) and its immediate acceptance by the Majlis took the Soviet Embassy and its few supporters in the Majlis completely by surprise. Russian wrath at this further rebuff was evident in the comments of the Tudeh press and was made clear by the Soviet Ambassador in an interview with the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs when the Ambassador stated that the passing of this Bill had increased the dissatisfaction of the Soviet Government with the Persian Government. Kavtaradzeh returned to Moscow at the first opportunity. 2. Russian counter-action has taken various forms. An attempt was made by a Deputy, Rahimian, who, although not a member of the Tudeh party, owes his seat to Russian assistance, to table a Bill cancelling the A.I.O.C. concession, but for this no support at all was forthcoming. The Soviet Ambassador demanded the suppression of half a dozen papers which had supported Sa’ed and criticised the actions of local Russian officials. Persians, both official and non-official, have been expelled from the northern provinces on the grounds that they were hostile to Russia. Deputies are being subjected to anonymous threats and, to add point to these, a refugee from Soviet Armenia has been shot by terrorists. The Tudeh party has published a manifesto alleged to represent the views of a mass meeting of 50,000 Persians in Tabriz demanding the formation of provincial councils in accordance with the Constitution, the prosecution of Sa’ed, the exile of Seyyid Zia, the abrogation of military governorship, the dismissal from Government service of the “ agents of dictatorship ” and denouncing the Deputies “ elected by force or money” as being unrepresentative of the people. A meeting did actually take place in Tabriz on the 1st December for which the Soviet authorities had attempted to collect in their own transport Kurds, Shahsevans and villagers. The response was poor. The tribes did not come in at all and the total crowd collected did not exceed 5,000, mostly workmen of local Tabriz factories. 3. It may be inferred from the terms of the manifesto that it will now be Soviet policy to work up an agitation in the northern provinces for the estab lishment of provincial and district councils and some measure of autonomy. Such councils are allowed for in the Constitution, but they have never been formed. It may also be assumed that anyone openly opposing Soviet policy in the northern provinces will be labelled as a Fascist and expelled. 4. The Soviet-inspired Persian press professes to see in the ready acceptance of Dr. Musaddiq’s Bill and the rejection of Rahimian’s proposal proof of the subservience of the Majlis and the Government to British influence and to the power of A.I.O.C. money. Russia, it is claimed, desires only to protect Persia and herself from the designs of “reactionary and imperialistic Powers.” [61' 38] ,Imperialist Powers were sometimes forced to seek the help of and to profess svmpathv with freedom-loving Russia, but once they had achieved their purpose t^ey 5 reverted to type, as witness British support of the reactionaries in Belgium Grice, Italy and Persia. If the Persian people thought that Great Britain would protect them they should ask the oppressed people of Egypt, Iraq and 1 alestme what they thought of British protection. 5 To counter the “Freedom Front' formed by papers under Russian influence, an “ Independence Front ' has been formed by twenty-eight other papers These include the less disreputable and more or less independent papers. They have made some bold and outspoken attacks on Soviet policy and on its instrument, the Tudeh party. Of the half-dozen whose suppression was asked for by the Soviet Ambassador, three have been suppressed. On the other hanci, seven of the pro-Russian papers have been suppressed for attacks on the Government. _ , , .... f 6. The debate on the programme of the Government produced criticisms ox previous Governments for over-subservience to demands of foreign Powers, an insistence on the preservation of balance in foreign relations and bitter attacks on Dr Millspaugh. The Prime Minister promised that he would make dehmte proposals regarding the future of Dr. Millspaugh within ten days—that is, by the 14th December. The Government was given a vote of confidence by 75. Deputies, 9 opposing and 16 abstaining. It is probable that tne Prime Minister will insist on the retirement of Dr. Millspaugh or on a drastic curtailment of his ^ 7.

Sartip Mansour Muzayyinni has resumed command of the 2nd (Tehran) Division (see Summary No. 41/44, paragraph 11 (ii)). Internal Security. 10. Persian forces have now occupied Sardasht in addition to Baneh. The General Staff profess to be satisfied with the military situation in this now that Hama Rashid has been detained by the Iraqi authorities. Their desire to occupy Mahabad with an adequate garrison has again been blwked by the Russians who, after holding out some hope, have recently given a definite refusal. There is, however, some anxiety regarding the supply situation of the Persian garrisons in Baneh and Sardasht. Snow has probably already blocked the roads for motor transport and the amount of supplies now stocked m Baneh is totally inadequate for the needs of the troops until the spring. Khuzistan. 11. It is now reported that some 1,500 rifles have been collected from the Beni Turuf Further operations seem to be hanging fire pending negotiations between the Persian and Iraqi Governments for the surrender or disarmament of certain sections of the tribe who have taken refuge in Iraq. Fars. 12. There has been some raiding by Boir Ahmadis of villages in the neighbourhood of Semirum and Shahreza. Flocks of sheep have been carried off, including 300 from the Darashuri families, who had been left by Nasir Qashgai near Semirum for the express purpose of preventing Boir Ahmadi raiding. East Persia. 13. The gang of brigands, eleven in all, who carried out the attack on U.K.C.C. trucks, mentioned in paragraph 13 of Summary No. 44/44, have been captured. It is probable that the leaders at least will be executed.- American Affairs. 14. Mr. Harriman, United States Ambassador in Russia, has passed through Tehran on his way to Moscow. Chinese Affairs. * 15. A Chinese Consulate has been opened in Meshed. Russian Affairs. 16. While recent Russian policy in Persia has confirmed the consistently- held fears of many Persians, it has dispelled the illusions that had been created in others by the generally correct behaviour of Russian troops. Where Russia had gained respect, she has now lost it, and she is now almost universally regarded, and feared, by Persians as an aggressive, grabbing Power. To counter this, the Soviet-inspired Persian press is representing Soviet policy as being defensive, with the object of ensuring that Persia does not become a base for the hostile activities of imperialist Powers. As the source of such arguments is accepted by all Persians to be the Soviet Embassy, more particularly as they are used by Russian officials in conversation with Persians, the harmony of Anglo- Russian relations is not obvious to Persians in spite of the best efforts of British officials. 17. It is reliably reported that a Russian party recently made a reconnaissance of the roads across the Kavir between Gunabad on the Meshed- Zahidan road and Kerman. 18. The report in Summary No. 44/44, paragraph 15, that a platoon of Russian infantry had arrived in Birjand, is not confirmed. Russian officers have, however, been making enquiries about accommodation at Birjand for a detach ment which they explained may be required to assist in the movement to Meshed of horses they have purchased m Zabul. 19. Iransovatrans are still operating transport services from Yazd and Isfahan over the roads leading northwards. The report in Summary No. 39/44, paragraph 14, that they had closed down these activities was incorrect. 20. The Russian school has now opened officially in Tabriz with an attendance of about 300 children. The school is divided into two sections, in one of which the language used is Russian, in the other Turki. Tehran, IQth December, 1944. Appendix. Appendix to Intelligence Summary No. 47/44.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 48 for the period the 11th December to the 17th December, 1944, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, 18£A December, 1944. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 48 for the Period \lth-~\lth December, 1944. (Secret.) Political. Persian Affairs. BEFORE his departure Kavtaradzeh informed the Prime Minister that he regarded the passing of Dr. Musaddiq’s Bill by the Majlis (see Summary -No. 47/44, paragraph 1) as an act unfriendly to Russia and that its revision was essential to the re-establishment of good relations between the Soviet and Persian Governments. In an account of this interview published in a news-sheet in 1 ersian which is issued in Tehran by the Soviet Embassy it was added that Ka\ taradzeh had told the Prime Minister that he realised that the law had been passed as a result of pressure by enemies of Perso-Soviet friendship, such as Sa ed and Seyyid Zia, and that such a law was inconsistent with the existence of concessions already enjoyed by foreigners in Persia. The Prime Minister and his Government have been considerably perturbed by the menacing attitude of Kavtaradzeh, and they are in a mood to make concessions to placate the Russians. These might take the form of asking them to provide the experts and the machinery for the exploitation of the oil in the northern provinces by a so-called Persian company. , The Russians icalise that the opposition of the IVIajlis must be overcome, and it is on that body that their attention is now concentrated. Bribes have been offered to Deputies and, it is said, have been accepted by some. Others are beino- intimidated by threats. Many are beginning to waver, and it cannot now be assumed with any confidence that a majority would be found ready to oppose proposals by the Government to give concessions to the Russians that would in effect be tantamount to surrender. Faith in the courage of the Government has been shaken by their failure to make any vigorous protest against the expulsion from the northern provinces of officials and other Persians displeasino- to the Russians or to recall the Governor-General of Eastern Azarbaijan for°sendino' a clear telegram recommending the grant to the Russians of the concession thev were demanding. 3. It seems dear that in the northern provinces the Russians are sueceedine m intimidating all opposition. Some 150 workmen who refused to join the Tudeh party have been expelled from factories in Gilan and Mazanderan Deputies rTi m § _ t 1 he P rovinces occupied by Russian troops, although 'thev would be the first to lose by the triumph of Russian designs, seem prepared to go to almost any length to piopitiate the Russians in the vain hope of saving their estates r r, 4 ' iJu* Pl T&gt; e Minist f r has laid before th e Majlis a Bill for the abrogation of Dr. Millspaugh s special economic powers and for the transfer of those powers [61-49] ' /2 to the Government. It is expected that the Bill will be passed and that ^ Dr. Millspaugh will accept the position where his functions will be limited to those of Administrator-General of the Finances. 5. Following on an interpellation of the Government (which was, however, withdrawn) on two matters—the alleged illegal suppression of certain newspapers on the demand of the Soviet Embassy and the acquiescence of the Government in ^ the expulsion by Soviet officials of Persian subjects from the northern provinces— the Government was given a vote of confidence by 72 votes against 5, with 15 abstentions. Economic. 6. For the anti-locust campaign in Persia this year the British military authorities are giving assistance by lending a transport unit of some fifty-six vehicles with the necessary personnel. This unit will operate in the area Lingah- Bandar Abbas—Jask and it will be used for transporting poison bait and working parties and for maintaining communications. A ppointments — Civil. 7. —(i) Hassan Farzaneh (F.O. 63) to be Governor-General of the 1st Ustan (Gilan). (ii) Abbas Tabatabai to be Farmandar of Khoi. (iii) Dr. Buzurgmihr to be Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Health. Persian Forces. Army. 8. It is reliably reported that the Shah has lost faith in the Chief of the \ General Staff, General Razmara, and has realised that he is an ambitious and self-seeking adventurer, all the more dangerous since he is both energetic and able. General Razmara has also lost the favour of the Russians, largely owing to the action taken to suppress Tudeh demonstrations by the Military Governor, a nominee of General Razmara’s. His obvious desire to be restored to favour has raised doubts of his patriotism. The Shah wishes General Yazdan Panah to succeed him. and in present circumstances he is probably the least objectionable choice the Shah is likely to accept. It may be difficult to persuade General Yazdan Panah to accept. 9. General Ridley has returned to America. It is reported from confidential sources that he is to discuss the future of the American advisers to the Persian army and also to endeavour to arrange for the shipment of supplies for the Persian army. He is expected to be away for at least a month. 10. A Bill has been laid before the Majlis to legalise the selection by ballot of the number of conscripts required each year by the army, the quota for each town or district being assessed according to its population. 1 In the preamble to the Bill it is stated that the average class that becomes liable to conscription each year amounts to 120,000, but that not more than 40,000 are required by the army. Gendarmerie. 11. Following on the issue of new winter uniforms, of extra blankets and of transport and the more regular payment of salaries, an improvement is now noticeable in the morale and appearance of the gendarmerie of the Tehran district. This has resulted in a notable improvement in recruiting. Russian Affairs. 12. Persian papers that receive their inspiration from Russian sources have ' recently been publishing articles accusing Great Britain of a reactionary and imperialist policy and arguing that Russia must protect herself against the establishment in Persia of a Government under British influence. Two examples i of these articles are attached to this Summary. If these articles were not, as is generally believed, dictated by the Russians, they were certainly not published without their approval. 13. Within the last few days the Russians have brought to Tehran sixty Mk. V Yak fighters and ten Mk. I trainers, which are now in hangars at the Russian-controlled airfield. This part of the airfield is now closed to British personnel.I (jx°) . 14. At the same airfield the Russians have some 400 lorries, although for their needs they require no more than fifty or sixty; and some 800 men stationed there are regularly trained in battle drill, anti-lank action, &amp;c. Reports are circulating to the effect that some thousands of suits of civilian clothing have been ordered, and the popular theory is that Russian troops will be dressed in these to _y\^take part in Tudeh demonstrations. 15. The Persian committee that was formed for the collection of funds for Soviet sufferers from the war has published its final accounts, showing that a sum of 7,801,651 rials has been handed to the Soviet Ambassador. French Affairs. 16. General de Gaulle passed through Tehran on his return from Moscow, leaving Tehran on the 14th December. Appendix. Extracts from Russian subsidised Persian Press. Azhir, 10 th December, 1944. LEADER entitled “ Is the New British Policy Right? ” prints at the top of the article the following verse from Sa’di : “ I heard that a lamb was saved by a great man from the mouth of a wolf. In the evening he brought out his knife and began to cut the throat of the lamb. The lamb complained and said : ‘ You, who rescued me from the clutches of the wolf, I see that at the end you are wolf.' ” The writer states that he had learned the meaning of this story when he was a child. He then goes on to say that in spite of the loud protesta tions and announcements and charters, nevertheless there was abundant witness that force still prevailed in the world. On the previous day the Belgian people w-ere fired upon and they w 7 ere told that they had no right to Jtake steps against a Government which had left them without a guardian in the savage war of the Nazis and had taken refuge in London, where it had passed its time with ceremonial visits. Although the youth of Belgium had shed its blood for the freeing of its homeland and suffered hunger, imprisonment and exile, and crimes had been committed against it by the Nazis, it had finally driven out from its homeland the evil forces of fascism and puppets of foreigners. It was now considered as rebels and was obliged to lay down its arms without query and to surrender to a Government which threatened it, in the event of refusal, with the great forces w 7 hich it (that Government) had rescued from the battlefields of Hitler and stored up for such a day; The youth of Belgium was told by this Government that it had been freed in order that it should act in accordance with the will of that Government and that the Atlantic Charter could not be inter preted in any other way. Of course, the people should decide their ow r n destinies. The British people would do this, but under the force of arms and the yoke of that Government. After Belgium came the turn of Greece. The British Prime Minister in his speech revealed the hidden plan of British Conservative states men. The world had opened its eyes and realised the true meaning of these charters. It had realised that the colonial policy of the leaders of the Conserva tive party and other reactionary British elements would not change so easily. The British reactionaries, contrary to the desire of the British people, wmuld not refrain from using force and holding dowm weak peoples with pressure. Churchill said the Greek people naturally were free to decide their own destiny. They could choose whatever regime they liked, but they had no right to take action in this matter, and the different classes in Greece could not struggle with each other in order to determine what regime they should have. If they took up arms Churchill had said that the British, in the name of the preservation of security, would prevent any kind of violent action. These apparently logical words had a frightening meaning which Churchill’s recent speech confirmed. Churchill m his recent speech had said that, although the Greek crusaders had shown self- sacrifice in turning out the German invaders, they had not a majority, and the Greek people would decide upon the Government of Greece. W ith these apparently logical words the fight against the proud crusaders of Greece had begun. Thus those who had liberated Athens became the targets of the British [61—49] B 2 \4 forces and the streets of the capital were turned into rivers of blood. This was the blood of young men who had risen up against Hitler, in spite of hunger and other hardships, with the most primitive weapons, even with sticks. The British Parliament two evenings ago had supported this ungenerous light with a vote of confidence for Churchill of 179 to 30. Action similar to this tyrannical action, with minor differences, was being witnessed in Italy. There also in the name of the preservation of security, interference was taking place in the destiny of the people. If the American forces had not been there, perhaps the streets of Home would have witnessed the same terrible scenes as the streets of Athens, and Churchill, in the name of the preservation of the rights of the majority, would have made the Italian people, the real enemies of fascism, targets and would have set up a Government which was 100 per cent, obedient to the orders of the Conservatives in London. It was apparent that any Government which was contrary to the taste or policy of the British Prime Minister and rose up against the puppets of London was not the representative of the majority of the people. To establish this view it was not necessary to refer to the votes of the people; the words of Churchill and the majority of the British Parliament were sufficient proof. It was not clear that this policy would not extend to France and other liberated countries and that Churchill, to preserve security, would not interfere officially in deciding the Government for the whole world. Although the American Government had expressed its dissatisfaction in Italy and announced officially that it would on no account interfere in the internal affairs of the country and that the Italian people, like other peoples of the world, had the right in accordance with the Atlantic Charter to decide their own destiny and bring to power any regime and any Government which they pleased, the conduct of Mr. Churchill’s Government had caused great anxiety among the great masses of the world. Persians had not detailed knowledge of world affairs, but it seemed to them that the British Government and the majority in Parliament had caused affairs, with their rough policy, to reach a critical point. People were already becoming suspicious of the unity among the Allies. In Persia, over the oil question and the Government of Sa’ed, the British press had not followed a good policy. It seemed as if the London press was not much attached to unity among the Allies. The questions of Belgium, Greece, Italy and Poland confirmed this view. Did the British Government think the enemy was completely defeated ? Did it not think that such manifestations might be made use of by Hitler? Was the real English people in agreement with this policy ? Had the majority in Parliament voted for the shedding of the blood of the Greek crusaders in accordance with the desires of the^British people? Were British soldiers in agreement with Churchill that they should use their arms against their allies who had shown self-sacrifice and that they should impose upon them a Government which had not taken the smallest step to help them (the Greek crusaders) in their struggle? Would history repeat itself? Would reactionary elements and Conservative diplomats take control of world affairs and keep the peoples in slavery and darkness? Would parasites and executioners oppress the peoples in the name of the majority. The paper did not think that this plan would be easily or profitably accomplished or that the British people could succeed in such a heavy task. Rahbar, IQth December, 1944. LEADER states that Kavtaradzeh had left Persia after a stay of a little over a month. None of the Persian authorities were prepared to listen to him or to consider the proposal which he brought. Sa'ed, with the formula “ oil after the war,” put an obstacle in his way; Dr. Musaddiq went further than this and placed the responsibility for the exploitation of oil on a Government which could not even asphalt the streets of its own capital. There was, perhaps, no precedent for the refusal to consider a proposal brought by the Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs of another country. Supposing' Kavtaradzeh’s proposal had been inacceptable, what international exigencies could have made it proper to refuse to consider it? Kavtaradzeh had not left Persia because the oil problem was solved but because it was apparent that the ruling classes were not prepared to ask for a solution and were increasing the difficulties in his way. As the paper had stated before, the object of the Russian Government in applying for an oil concession was not to obtain an imperialist concession, but on the contrary the Russian Government had an urgent need to prevent imperialist influence in Persia, and it considered an oil concession a means of achieving tliis. What Power could guarantee tliat a second dictator would not appear in Persia after the war andrecreate the period of Reza Khan, which suffocated all democratic inclinations and friendly feelings towards Russia? Dr. Musaddiq, in his speech on oil, had shown that the royalties received from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were spent on the railway and the purchase of arms, neither of which were in the interests of Persia, but were to be used against the Russian Government one day. As it happened, world events were such that they were used for the benefit of Russia. (But who could guarantee that this would be the case in the future and they would not be used against Russia by a reactionary Government ? The Russian Govern ment had not undertaken all these sacrifices for a reactionary barrier to be put up against her as had been in the last twenty odd years, and for a Government like the hired Government of Poland or the dictatorship of Reza Khan to be put up. It was neither in the interests of Russia or of Persia that Russia’s interests should be neglected. The Russian Government could not tolerate a Government which had been born of the Government of Reza Khan or a similar Government. The Persian people also, from the point of view of both internal and foreign policy, were not prepared to tolerate such a Government. If the paper was criticised for talking-about Russian interests, it did so because Persian interests could only be assured by taking into consideration the interests of other Govern ments and peoples, and in particular the interests of powerful neighbouring Governments. Thus there were reasons why the paper should talk about Russian interests which, in the above-mentioned case, were in harmony with the interests of the Persian people in the opposition which they showed to reactionary elements in Persia and‘the Government of Reza Khan/ Apparently after the war the armies of the three Powers would leave Persia, but the real situation was that, if the condition of the Persian Government remained as it was at present, only the influence of Russia would be removed from Persia, because everybody knew that the Persian Government, the Persian Majlis, Persian politicians and the Administration did not belong to the Persian people and were merely agents who had no will of their own. Consequently it was natural that the Russian Government was anxious at this “ set-up,” and the Persian people had the rig t to strive with all their might to change the nature of the Government. I he reactionary Government of Persia opposed with all its force the grant of an oil concession to Russia and welcomed with joy the Bill of Dr. Musaddiq, whic , like the orders of Reza Khan, was ratified without discussion, lest any deviation from his one-sided policy as a result of the grant of this concession should occur The paper would repeat that the way taken by the Persian Government had not solved the problem. The Majlis and Dr. Musaddiq had merely shown that they could not solve such problems. Dr. Musaddiq and his followers had not removed the problem; they had merelv removed its solution from the competence of the Persian Government and handed this over to foreign circles. In conclusion, the paper asks the Russian Government not to consider the conduct of the Persian Government, which was based upon reactionary circles the expression of e Persian people, and to be assured that the Persian peop e were disgusted at e one-sided policy of the Governments which were imposed upon them, and would never take any measures against nations which respected their independence and freedom.v l jt VAa/v^JLaA of J V' THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT • @ PERSIA.

II is reliably reported that the Soviet Ambassador has told the Persian * Prime Minister that he had been instructed to inform him that the Soviet Government considered that, until the law prohibiting the granting of an oil concession to any foreign organisation was revised, good relations could not be established between the Soviet and Persian Governments. This intimation has dispelled the hope that Kavtaradzeh had perhaps gone further than Moscow intended; and the consideration of means to placate the Soviet Government is now occupying the Government’s attention to the exclusion of nearly all other business. 2. Russian or Russian-inspired activities are being intensified among all classes of Persians. Propaganda has been extended to the schools. Anxiety is increasing in the middle classes, particularly among the Deputies and Cabinet Ministers. Threats are being circulated from some source or another that in the next demonstrations organised by the Tudeh party attempts will be made on the lives of landowners, priests and Government officials. Prominent Tudeh leaders, such as Iraj Iskandari, have been sent to Mazanderan, allegedly to organise opposition to the Vatan party, which has some following there. In many places there is labour unrest. After meetings of factory workers convened by the leader of the Tudeh party in Yazd, where they were incited against their employers, the workers of the most important textile factory went on strike. In one of the mills in Shahi (Mazanderan) a demonstration by the workers led to rioting and to shooting by the gendarmerie, which resulted in the wounding of some workers and the death of a Soviet soldier who was in the vicinity. The Russian troops thereupon disarmed the gendarmerie and, according to one fairly reliable report, have expelled them from Shahi. A partial strike also occurred in the Tehran munincipal power house, which was prevented from spreading by the introduction of Persian military technicians to operate the machinery. From Meshed it is reported that the Soviet Consul-General has taken eleven Persians to Tashkent to attend the celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the Turkmenistan Republic. In Azarbaijan propaganda for the formation of provincial and district councils continues. 3. The Russian-inspired Persian press continues to make hardly veiled attacks on the imperialist nature of British policy in Europe and the east and to stress the argument that Russian policy is directed towards ensuring that Persia does not fall under the influence of imperialist powers. The Russians says the Tudeh paper Rahbar, do not fear the Persian people but only those [61—110] B cip e vg/yysg d i i 'to tO •o elements who may make them their tools. The Russian desire for a security zone^ is natural, since by that is meant a zone adjacent to the Russian people where those elements will not be allowed to take root. Between the two wars the British established paramount influence in Persia with the object of making it a base for hostile action against Russia. They first intended to do so by means of the 4 1919 agreement, but they found a better way by bringing Reza Shah to power. A situation similar in some respects to that of i918 exists to-day. 4. Another example of this propaganda is attached to this summary as the first appendix. It is having some effect, inclining Persians to think that Russia might modify her policy if British influence was less evident and that it might even be as well if Persians showed themselves to be a little anti-British. They j are not without justification for believing that hostility to the British is a passport I to Russian favour. 5. Seyyid Zia recently published in one of the Persian papers a frank and courageous criticism of Russian policy in Persia. A summary is attached hereto as the second appendix. It created a considerable impression. The paper published about five times its usual number of copies, and even then copies were selling for up to 30s. each. Seyyid Zia’s reputation now stands higher among his countrymen, but there are some who think that it was his return to Persia that provoked the Russians to take aggressive measures to counteract British influence and to prevent the establishment of a pro-British Government. 6. The Prime Minister has tabled a Bill for the establishment of a Supreme Supervisory Council whose function it would be to make detailed study of Bills drafted by the Government before they are tabled. Its composition would be the Ministers without Portfolio, the Under-Secretary of State in the Prime Minister’s office and five experts in various branches of administration. 7. The Bill for the abrogation of the economic powers of Dr. Millspaugh has not yet passed the Parliament. The Deputies have now had to face the fact that it is not easy to find an alternative arrangement for the effective control of the national economy. Various proposals have been made : the creation of a Ministry of National Economy; the distribution of economic affairs among existing ministries; the appointment of a Superior Economic Council who would continue to control economic affairs through changes of Government; and the transfer to the present Prime Minister personally of the powers held previously by Millspaugh. The last proposal has found little favour. There is a fairly general appreciation that the economy of the country cannot be put on a sound footing without a long-term programme consistently carried out. This the Deputies realise would not be the case if full economic powers were to be vested in anyone so short-lived as a Persian Cabinet Minister. There is now some appreciation of the advantages there were in having all economic powers concentrated in the hands of a permanent and impartial official; and as a result Dr. Millspaugh's stock has gone up. 8. The Independent Front newspapers (see Summary No. 47/44, paragraph 5) have published a manifesto expressing disapproval of the policy of the Government whom it accuses of showing hostility to democracy, of illegally suppressing newspapers, and of general weakness and inactivity. 9. An expert review of the Persian press shows that of 107’papers, including weeklies, with licence to publish in Tehran, about 70 can be classed as having negligible influence; very few have a circulation large enough to cover the cost of publication; 13 draw their inspiration from Russian sources. Not all publish regularly. A appointments — civil.

A rmy.. 11. Discord was not long in showing itself between the recently-appointed, or rather reappointed. Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff. In the four months during which there had been no Minister, General Razmara had done more or less as he liked in the army, and in the provinces, particularly m the tixfial areas, he had usurped more and more of the functions of the Ministrv of the Interior. The Shah had become distrustful of his intrigues and ambition; the Russians were displeased with him since they held him responsible for the6 action taken by the Military Governor of Tehran to suppress Tudeh demonstra tions; and he had for one reason or another antagonised many of the Deputies. Consequently there was little opposition to his removal. He was the most able, knowledgeable and energetic Chief of the Staff that has been seen during the last three years, but he is unscrupulously ambitious, corrupt and an inveterate intriguer. He has been succeeded by General Hassan Arfa, a strong Nationalist, resentful of foreign interference in Persia, obsessed by fear of Russian designs and consequently, for the present, not unfriendly to the British. He has neither popularity nor much respect in the army. A ir Force. 12. General Ahmad Nakchevan, now appointed Inspector-General of the Persian Air Force, who recently returned from an official visit to England, has now left to visit America on the invitation of the United States Government. He travelled in the same aircraft as General Connolly.

Internal Security. 14. For some time past the Tudeh press, which previously had been inclined to champion the tribes as sufferers from the tyrannous British-supported regime of Reza Shah, has been accusing them of being the supporters of reactionaries and of feudalism. The reactionaries are accused not only of opposing proposals for disarmament but also of supplying arms and ammunition to the tribes. Reports have been published of consignments of arms landed on the Persian shores of the gulf and distributed among the tribes. It is made clear that the reactionaries referred to are the “masters ” of Seyyid Zia and his like. The alleged union of the tribes of the south comes in for much attack. One of the Russian subsidised Persian papers says that it is no surprise that Qavam ul Mulk and Morteza Quli Khan Bakhtiari should fall in with the designs of those whose servants they had long been but expresses amazement that Nazir Qashgai, who like his father had always posed as a great patriot, should now have become a Persian Quisling. Such attacks are likely to have some effect on Nasir and they may discourage him from being too openly friendly with British officials. Khuzestan. 15. It seems that the Persian authorities are satisfied with the number of arms collected from the Beni Turuf. Attention has now been diverted to the Bani Tamim who have begun to surrender their alms. Russian Affairs. Id- The following is believed to be an accurate list of Russian general officers in Persia :— At Kasvia— Lieut.-General Soyietnikoff: Commanding all Russian forces in Persia. Major-General Gaidukov : 2nd in command to above. Major-General Russov : Chief of Staff. At Tabriz— Major-General Glinski : Commanding troops in Azarbaijan Major-General Lobov : Chief of Staff. [61—110]4 At Rezaieh— ' Major-General Smirnov : Commanding troops in Western Azarbaijan. At Gurgan— Major-General Trantin : Commanding troops. At Sari— Major-General Soboleff (?) : Commanding troops. At Semnan— Major-General Filiatov : Commanding troops. At Tehran— Major-General Kargin : Soviet Transport Directorate. Major-General Zorin : Iransovtrans. It is understood that the two last-named are independent of General Sovietnikoff. 17. It is reported, but not yet confirmed, that, of the sixty Yak fighters that the Russians had brought to Tehran (see Summary No. 48/44, paragraph 13), thirty have returned to Russia. Erench Affairs. 18. It is reported on fairly reliable authority that the French Government has invited the Persian Government to send five officers to France to visit the front. Egyptian Affairs. 19. The Persian press reports that Mahmud Sabet Pasha has been appointed Egyptian Ambassador to Persia. Turkish Affairs. 20. Kamal Kuprulu, said now to be Turkish Ambassador in Afghanistan, has been appointed Turkish Ambassador to Persia. American Affairs. 21. Major-General Connolly, commanding the United States Persian Gulf Command, has been recalled to America for another appointment. He has been succeeded, temporarily at least, by his second-in-command, Brigadier-General Booth. Appendix 1. Extracts from Russian-subsidised Persian Press. Rahbar, 21s£ December, 1944. Furthermore, if the Imperialist Powers needed a “ sphere of influence ” to preserve their colonies, if Persia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Egypt were called colonial annexations ” in their political lexicon, then Russia, whose regime was anti-imperialistic, could not tolerate being surrounded by the imperialistic Powers, their colonies or their sphere of “ influence,” which would when the time came flood over her new world. For this reason Russia, after having niade enormous sacrifices to save herself and the world, would not submit to being encircled by the imperialist Powers. She wanted to clear her boundaries of the nefarious influence of imperialism. Otherwise her security and her existence would be in danger. For this reason the territories of the neighbours of Russia could be called a belt of security, i.e., places where no bee-hive against Russia could be built.5 ® No doubt to-day Britain was the ally and friend of Persia and was not considered as the country which had signed the 1907 and 1919 treaties, and the wntei did not want his opponents to use his statements as evidence against him, but, in order to elucidate the matter, he would mention the following few examples :— (1) In 1312, when a plan for a trans-Persian railway linking the east of Persia and the Afghan borders with the Gulf was under discussion, Lord Cui'zon had stated that for fifty years the principle of the defence of India consisted of surrounding her with a belt of impassable mountains and deserts and the projected railway would rob the defence of India of the strategic value of the Persian Desert and would bring the Russians 1,000 miles nearer to India, &amp;c. (2) In the 1907 treaty Persia was so partitioned that the Russians had no common frontier with Afghanistan and the neutral zone was very narrow in the west and very broad in the east; this was another measure which was taken for the defence of India. Now, of course, Britain had reconsidered the problem of the defence of India, but one could not forget that before this war Russia was surrounded by countries which were under the influence of an anti-Russian policy and great damages were inflicted upon her. Now Russia, in order to secure her interests, was compelled to eradicate the influence of the nefarious anti-Russian policy from these districts. These regions were considered the belt of security for Russia not in the sense of being under Russian influence, but that anti-Russian influences should not be implanted there. Appendix 2. Summary of the statement published by Seyyid Zia-ed-Din Tabatabai in Ra'di Imruz of the 20^ December, 1944. KAVTARADZEH’S statement that the Oil Bill was the work of enemies of Soviet-Persian friendship such as Sa’ed and myself is an unforgivable calumny as well as a blunder against the Majlis. Persia has never been a menace to Russia —witness my own actions twenty-four years ago when Britain, then in occupation of Persia, could, had she wdshed, have threatened to have disreputed Russia. I welcomed the first Soviet representative to Tehran : now, thanks to the errors of Soviet representatives, I am accused of anti-Russian activities. No patriotic Persian is so stupid as even to wish to work against Russia. Such statements by Soviet representatives are deliberate attempts to find pretexts and confuse the issue. The claim that the northern provinces are a “ security zone ' is only a prelude to further, and at last total, encroachment. If this principle is admitted, other countries will claim a security zone in Persia. Even if Great Britain and India were a menace to Russia, “ security zone ' has no meaning in view of the modern development and range of air power; and Persia does not come into the picture as a bulwark. In any case, the question does not arise; the world is fighting for peace and does not accept the “ Lebensraum ” principle—for that is what the “ security zone ” claim is. If, after the war, the Majlis should decide to grant a concession to a foreign Power, the U.S.S.R. should be given precedence; because we are bound to her by ties of gratitude, of admiration and of propinquity. The interference of the Allies in the internal affairs of Persia is contrary to the letter of the Treaty; and encroachment on Persia’s integrity daily increased. The Persian Government is now incapable of enforcing its authority. British officials in the west and south, Soviet officials in the north interfered in the elections : this interference was the direct result of the presence of Allied troops in the capital, and of the intimidation of the central Government. Soviet troops prevent Persians travelling about their own country; Soviet authorities expel Persian citizens from the northern provinces; the Cabinet has to have Soviet permission to send out its own troops to preserve security. Persians have become suspicious of the political intentions of the Allies.6 Even in this atmosphere an amicable solution of the oil question could have? been reached—had not the statements of Kavtaradzeh and the anti-Sa’ed agitation of Tudeh demonstrators and the Russian-backed press deliberately exacerbated the situation. Kavtaradzeh, whose intentions were good, was not of reality to blame. He was misled by the Soviet Embassy and the Tudeh. Still,^*^ 4 . his statement was inconsistent with common courtesy and international rights. He had no legal power to break off diplomatic relations. We realised that the Soviets had the power to bully us; but we could not suppose that a Government professing the principles of Lenin would support its Embassy in humiliating us ; especially after our sacrifices on its behalf. Sa’ed’s only fault was trust in the Soviet Government and in Stalin’s declaration, made at Tehran. He was not discourteous, much less criminal. He did his duty. But the demonstrators against him on the 27th October were protected by Russian machine-guns—not only in Tehran. Telegrams to our representatives abroad, telling them of our humiliation, were held up by the Allied censorship. We realised that we had lost our independence. Sa’ed stood firm : but the shameful behaviour of our Allies drove him to resign. The heart breaking letter of resignation should be read to future generations in Persian schools. The base, unfounded calumny of accusing certain people of enmity to Soviet- Persian friendship is the result of bad advice given to Soviet representatives in Persia by a handful of Persian traitors : their object being to save the face of the Soviet officials who had blundered. As to the points of Kavtaradzeh’s statement— ( 1 ) It is no business of a foreigner to point out the mistakes of the Majlis; which is alone competent and independent. (2) The Majlis was compelled by the threats and other mistakes of Soviet representatives in Persia to ban future oil conversations. Still, I had myself wished for the Oil Law to remain valid .only for so long as Allied armies remained on Persian soil. (3) Foreign concessions already existed at the time of the r I reaty of the 24th February, 1921, and the southern oil concession still exists. So long as Allied representatives are prepared to honour the Tehran declaration they have no right to put forward interpretations or alterations detrimental to Persian sovereignty. ( 4 ) The Majlis decision was not a mistake: whether some day it may be revised depends on whether Soviet representatives change their policy of interference. It will not be revised so long as a single foreign soldier remains on Persian soil, nor while the fate of Cabinets depends not on the Majlis and the Shah but on foreign Embassies and synthetic demonstrations. Our first duty is to clarify our external relations, which is impossible without a Government which will stand up to foreigners, invite foreign Governments to withdraw their troops and refuse to tolerate interference. A declaration should be issued that, if our relations are not clarified soon, the capital will be transferred elsewhere. Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill have the right to know what their representatives, the interpreters of their declaration, are doing in Persia. The aggressors rely on force, tyranny and military supremacy; Persia on right and justice. A definite date should be fixed for the departure of all foreign troops. This is possible only through a Government which will maintain both the integrity of Persia and the best possible relations with the U.S.S.R. The present Government cannot.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERT PERSIA. SECRET. Qr£&gt;¥°' * ^ %vycAJ&lt;&amp; JoF ufe PIIitEiNIC ^MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT r j January 17, 1945. Section 1.

Dr. Millspaugh still retains his powers. Although there is among the Deputies some measure of agreement that he should be deprived of them, argument still persists as to how the national economy should in future be controlled. 2. The Tudeh party is reported to have greatly extended their activities in , Tehran and to be making great efforts to increase their numbers and to organise bands, it is presumed with a view to demonstrations of some kind in the near future. The Persian police and military authorities are apprehensive of dis turbances and are revising and elaborating their plans for the suppression of civil disturbance. Their anxiety is increased by the readiness shown by the Russians to send troops to the scene of a demonstration. This happened not only in the Tudeh demonstration at the end of October (see Summary No. 41/44, para graph 1) but again on the 26th December, when there was a disturbance in connexion with an Ashura procession. On the latter occasion the mob had been dispersed before the arrival of the Russian troops who, they explained, had come to assist the Persian authorities. 3. A section of the press continues to attack British policy and to argue that Russia is justified in trying to prevent the establishment of British influence in North Persia. 4. A circular has been sent to all Governors-General and Governors instructing them to give wide publication to the following statement of the Government’s intentions :— (a) To prepare and put into execution plans for the improvement of the lot of villagers and workmen, ensuring that each individual receives • recompense according to his deserts.

THE Bill to deprive Dr. Millspaugh of his economic powers has, after much heated discussion, been passed by the Majlis by 69 votes against 6, with 20 abstentions. The Government has been charged with responsibility for the control of the economic organisations set up by Dr. Millspaugh. Within a month the Government must decide which of these should be abolished and whether those remaining should be distributed among existing ministries or transferred to a new Ministry of Economic Affairs. Within three months the Government must present to the Majlis a report on the accounts and activities of all the economic organisations controlled by Dr. Millspaugh; and must further, within the shortest possible period, set up a Supreme Economic Council to advise the Government in the preparation of a scientific plan to suit the country’s economic requirements. Particular attention is to be paid to preventing the transfer abroad of capital and to increasing exports. Some now fear, and some hope, that Dr. Millspaugh s control of the finances, which he retains, will allow him to continue to exercise some control over economic measures. Agitation for his dismissal continues in the Tudeh press, among aspirants to Russian favour and among the wealthy, who would suffer from his income tax law. Dr. Musaddiq, perhaps in the hope of placating the Russians, prepared a Bill for Millspaugh's dismissal, but he has not yet been able to obtain enough signatures to qualify it for presentation to the Majlis. It is understood that Dr. Black, at present head of the Cereals and Bread Section, may be asked to take temporary charge of the economic organisa tions previously controlled by Dr. Millspaugh. 2. Anxious speculation continues as to what the next move of the Russians through the agency of the Tudeh party will be. Tehran is full of rumours of a large influx of Caucasians and of Persians who had fled to Russia in Reza Shah s reign, brought into Persia as Russian troops and then turned loose in civilian clothes, but armed, to occupy the many houses the Russians are alleged to have hired in various quarters of the town. There is considerable anxiety with a corresponding desire either to seek Russian favour or to ask what British support will be forthcoming. 3. In Azerbaijan there is a lull in Tudeh and Russian activities, although some mild agitation for the formation of provincial and district councils continues. A Tudeh meeting organised to protest against Seyyid Zia’s manifesto, to which reference was made in Summary No. 49/44, paragraph 5, was attended by only about 100 people.

The Persians who visited Tashkent at the invitation of the Russians (see Summary No. 49/44, paragraph 2) have now returned and have described their experience with apparently genuine enthusiasm. They have sung high praise of the culture, prosperity, contentment, national pride and the respect for and vitality of the Islamic faith which they found in Uzbekistan. 5. A few Tudeh and pro-Russian papers have been suppressed for unseemly attacks on the Government and on British policy, but as they have reappeared under different names no useful effect has been created. 6. In paragraph 4 of Summary No. 1/45 a statement was given of the Government’s intentions. The laws mentioned in sub-paragraph (/), which it is intended to revise, are those relating to the formation of provincial and district councils. Persian Forces. Army. 7. The Minister of Finance has tabled a Bill asking for a credit of approximately 3 million dollars for the purchase of arms and supplies for the army in the year March 1945-March 1946 and authorising the Ministry for War to place orders in the United States to the value of that amount.

It is reliably reported that the Shah is becoming increasingly impatient with the continued existence at liberty of tribal chiefs, such as Nasir Qashgai and Abdullah Zarghampur of the Boir Ahmadi, who show no sign of recognising the authority of the Central Government or their duty towards their sovereign, and it is considered that it may be difficult to restrain him from ordering military operations to enforce their submission. The Tudeh press continues to attack tribal chiefs of the south. Morteza Quli Khan is dubbed a Bakhtiari outlaw, but Nasir Qashgai is the chief villain. The alleged union of the tribes of the south is said to be connected with the Pan-Arab movement, which was well known to have been devised as an obstacle to the spread of Russian influence. Khuzestan. 10. The second stage of the disarmament of the Arabs, which affects the Bani Tamim and the Bavi, is said to be proceeding satisfactorily and to be nearly completed. Russian Affairs. 11. It is reliably reported that the Russians have informed the Persian Government that they no longer require the production of the Persian munition factories. It will be remembered that they made a contract for the monthly supply of a number of rifles and machine pistols and a quantity of ammunition. A certain amount of each was delivered, but owing to the failure of the Russians to supply necessary raw materials in adequate quantities and to other causes, deliveries fell far short of the contracted amounts. The Russians did not seem to be greatly concerned, and this lent colour to the theory that they were more interested in making contact with the 5,000-6,000 workmen and in keeping the British out of the factories than in the munitions that might be produced. They are now free to stir up trouble among the workmen without damaging their own interests. 12. There appeared in the Russian-subsidised paper Rahbar a rather ominous statement to the effect that Russian policy was directed not only to the crushing of all Fascist States but also to the encouragement of movements among the working and middle classes of other countries against fascism or reaction and of the establishment of free national Governments, particularly in those States along Russia’s borders.3 13. It is reliably reported that the Russians recently spent spine days in e vicinity of Zarand( J ) reconnoitring for, surveying and measuring out a landing ground. T I 94; 14 r Russian troops are now preventing the entry into the Russian “zone of anti-Tudeh papers and confiscating any that are found there. British Affairs. 15. Ihe 1 udeh papers have begun attacks on the A.I.O.C., alleging bad treatment of their Persian employees and inefficient direction of the technical school where Persians are trained. The public is warned that the company’s lubricating oil is of such bad quality that it seems to be specially designed to wear out engines. This is perhaps in preparation for a campaign which may be launched by the Tudeh party against the company when Russia no longer requires the company’s products. 16. 1 he matter of Persia’s claims to Bahrein has also been raised in the Tudeh press.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith a copy of Intelligence Summary No. 3 for the period the 15th January to 21st January, 1945, compiled by the military attache to this legation. Tehran, ^nd January, 1945. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 3 for the Period Voth to 21s£ January, 1945. (Secret.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE Government has been concerned mainly with consideration of the measures that should be taken to replace the control of economic affairs exercised by Dr. Millspaugh through his American assistants. Certain appointments, detailed in paragraph 8 below, have been made supplanting the American heads of departments by Persians. The Americans, it was hoped, would continue to act in an advisory capacity. It is doubtful, however, whether any important American will agree to serve on without some power of control. Dr. Millspaugh has played into the hands of those who want to get rid of him altogether by notifying the Prime Minister that, unless the present governor of the National Bank is dismissed by the 23rd January, he will himself leave Persia. There was never much chance that the Government would be willing or would dare to dismiss the governor of the National Bank, a man who, whatever his faults, is honest and exceptionally able; and it is believed that Dr. Millspaugh is already aware of that, so he has presumably made up his mind to give up his work in Persia. His arbitrary action has dealt a blow not only to his own supporters, the number of whom has increased since he was relieved of control over economic affairs and limited to his responsibilities for the finances, but also to those who, while disapproving of Dr. Millspaugh personally, are convinced of the value to Persia in the present political situation of an American mission with some financial control. Dr. Millspaugh’s self-opinionated obstinacy has been of great assistance to all the opponents of American interest in Persia, of the establishment of stability and of economic and financial reforms. 2. There is growing discontent with the Prime Minister’s weakness and ineffectiveness, and it has been increased by his choice of his own friends as advisers to him on economic affairs and for lucrative employment in economic administrations. It is only the lack of a suitable successor that keeps him in power. Even that may not save him much longer. 3. Jealous to protect its honour against accusations made in the press to the effect that Deputies take advantage of their position to gain benefits for them selves, particularly in commercial transactions, the Majlis has passed a law authorising the appointment of a commission of five members to be elected by the Deputies to investigate any such charges made. 4. The Tudeh press has been making venomous attacks on Great Britain and on British policy. It is repeated ad nauseam that after the last war Great Britain had prepared Persia to be a “ springboard ” for hostile action against Russia. Two papers suggest that Seyyid Zia, on behalf of his masters, is organising a pseudo-Communist party who will create disturbances and bring the Tudeh party into disrepute and give the Government an excuse for breaking [62—34] RfiSfi. F jL EEPT. 23 MAR'9^ INDIA OFFICE!rwi up the party. Further attacks are made on the A.I.O.C. One paper ask^ | whether it is realised that thousands of unqualified Palestinians are employed by the company while the Persian workers of Khuzistan are naked and hungry. 5. The Tudeh leaders have openly said that it is now their intention to improve their organisations in the south with a view to showing their strength by organising demonstrations there which it will be impossible to attribute to Pussian influence. They have recently established a centre in Shiraz, where they already have two papers, and have begun an active campaign against those whom they believe to be the agents of British policy, notably Qavam-ul-Mulk and Nasir Qashgai. In Ahwaz also, with the arrival of a new Russian Consul, there has been an increase of Tudeh activity in the Workers’ Union. 6. The internees have been getting much publicity in the press. The Persian Go\ernment is urged to stand up for the rights of Persians and to bring the internees to trial so that their innocence or guilt can be established. Great Britain is taunted with having departed from her usual standards of justice. Much was made, first of all in the leading Tudeh paper, of an alleged insult by a junior British officer to an interned Persian colonel. Economic. \ 7. Unusually plentiful snow and rain throughout almost the whole length | and breadth of Persia has raised hopes of a superabundant harvest. This has not, however, yet had any notable effect on prices.

The latter is trying to strengthen his position by substituting his friends for Razmara’s ^in important posts Untortunately his friends are few, and some of those on whom he would place most reliance (since he believes that if they were once pro-German they are now certainly anti-Russian) are m the internment camp. It is reported, although not on the best authority, that both the Shah and the Russians already regret the dismissal of Razmara and that they have told him so. There is nothing improbable m this. He suits their book much better than General Arfa. r }^\ The following Persian officers are leaving shortly to visit the French Hehf/^S^h mV M at T °V h n Fre {V ch Government: Sartip Jawadi, Sarhang Hejazi, Sarhang Mazheri, Sarhang Mozayenni, Naib Sarhang Amini. _ .

Fars. ■ Nasi , r Q^shgai recently paid a visit to Mamassani and to Gach Saran in the hope that he might be recognised as a sort of tribal overlord and be accepted as the arbitrator between Abdullah Zarghampur and his enemies in un-i-ijalu. He is reported to be now returning to Shiraz with deflated pride and to be talking again of divesting himself of the responsibilities as regards the good order of the Qashgai which he accepted, and even of going abroad. Russian Affairs. 14. The headquarters of the Irano-Soviet Cultural Association in Tehran has now been turned into cc The House of Culture.” The speeches at the opening ceremony made it clear that the purpose of the House of Culture, which would be managed by V.O.K.S., was to publicise the cultural achievements of the Russian people and to teach the Russian language. It was promised that similar centres would be opened in other towns in Persia. 15. M. Hashimov has replaced M. Kommissaroff as Soviet Vice-Consul at Rezaieh. The latter returns to Tehran. 16. It is reported from a fairly reliable source that the Russians have now completed the widening, bridging and asphalting of the road Kazvin-Resht- Astara. The road is two-way throughout, and it is said that it will take all classes of traffic. It was built to higher specifications than British or American roads in Persia and, according to one source, it is much the best road in the country.. ^ ‘ ^ - * , THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Ol* HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT &lt;5 PERSIA.

Persian Affairs. Political. 1. No decision has yet been reached on the resignation of Dr. Millspaugh who has been granted 15 days local leave. 2. The Persian Prime Minister’s stock is said to be declining. Having achieved the abrogation of Dr. Millspaugh’s economic powers (and possibly his resignation also) he has done as much as his supporters could have hoped for. Having been in office for over two months and having used his power of patronage for the benefit of his relatives he is regarded as having had a good run for his money. Among the names of his possible successors that of Ali Scheili (F.O. 217; M.A. 283) has also been mentioned of late. 3. Dr. Black the American Chief of the Cereals and Bread Section tendered his resignation on the 18th January. It has not yet been accepted. 4. After the recent publication of His Imperial Majesty The Shah’s invitation to the three leaders to hold their next meeting in Tehran and his offer of his palaces to accommodate the party, many of the Persian newspapers have deduced that the next conference will take place in Tehran, and have urged the Persian Government to make certain requests to the three leaders for the relief of Persia’s present ills. 5. The Economic Commission, appointed to advise on the redistribution of the economic powers recently taken from Dr. Millspaugh, has submitted a preliminary report. Among its recommendations are :— (i) That the economic section of the Ministry of Finance should be separated from that Ministry and administered as a separate department until such time as a Ministry of Economics is created. (ii) That this department should be run on commercial lines. (iii) That Government control of certain commodities, such as key commodities, commodities in short supply or commodities imported after consultation with foreign Governments in control of trade in their own countries, should continue. (iv) That the Rent Stabilisation Department should be transferred to the Ministry of Justice, and that the Inspection Department of Foreign Trade and the Anti-Hoarding Department should be transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. 6. As the result of further misstatements in the Persian press about the internees and the alleged insult to Colonel Bahrami (see Intelligence Summary No. 3, paragraph 6) His Majesty’s Embassy have sent to the press a communique [63—11] OCA V/VJaA , rrsfc SEfia. r O A'2 which gives a correct account of this incident. This communique has been published in the newspapers Sitara and Kushish of the 26th January. It is j reproduced as an appendix to this summary. The Majlis. 7 The chief business of the week has been as follows :— (i) The appointment of a commission to investigate the alleged implication of Majlis Deputies in transactions with the Government for their own profit. The members are Hishmati, Mukhbir Faramand, Malik Madani, Engineer Farivar and Dr. Muazzami. (ii) the grant of a further delay of three months for the commission appointed to study the reforms of the Electoral Law. (iii) A request by the President of the Majlis that the Government’s letter to Dr. Millspaugh (informing him that the dispute between him and the Governor of the National Bank would be referred to the Majlis) should first be discussed by the Deputies outside the chamber. (iv) The debate on the Budget Bill was resumed. Some further proposals were accepted and others rejected. No final decision on the whole Bill was reached. (v) The tabling by the Ministry of Justice of a Bill for the formation of a supreme council of Registration. This council will examine the qualifications and conduct of notaries public. Persian A rmy. 8. A passing out ceremony was held on the 24th January at the Officers’ College in the presence of His Imperial Majesty The Shah. 950 cadets received their commissions. The parade was on the lines of past years, and consisted of a reception of His Imperial Majesty The Shah by the college in review order, a homily by a mullah, presentation of epaulettes to a selected cadet and a march past. The small size and poor physique of the cadets, in contrast to last year, was most noticeable. An innovation was the inclusion in the parade of a number of medical and engineering students who, by a recent regulation, now carry out their compulsory military training concurrently with their technical studies. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 9. The Azerbaijan branches of the Tudeh party met in session in Tabriz dui ing the second half of January. Delegates from all parts of the province attended. The results of the session have not been made public and many wild stories are circulating about the completeness of the Tudeh preparations for achieving autonomy. They included the arming by the Russians of Tudeh members and of a force of 5,000 Shakkak Kurdish horsemen, the murder of Persian officials, the seizure of power and preparation to do battle with any force sent from Tehran at chosen positions on the Qaflan Kuh. Sarhang Darakhshani, the Governor-General of Western Azerbaijan, does not believe the above in their entirety, but is of the opinion that something may happen in the spring and deplores the supineness of the Persian officials and the unlikelihood of their being able and willing to do anything in case of an emergency. Khuzistan. a time pilferage of railway wagons containing military and Aid to Russia stores has been causing the Allies great concern, and the uncanny certainty with which only wagons containing stores of saleable value have been rifled has led the Allied security authorities to suspect, that the thieves were led by persons having inside information. An ambush was recently laid by a combined British and American military party. A box car containing cloth was left at Faliyeh railway siding and covered by the party in ambush. ^A gano- 0 f 150 natives attempted to raid the box car. The gang was led by two American coloured soldiers and was engaged by the fire of the ambush'party and left twenty-six dead on the site. Twelve more are believed to have died of wounds in a nearby village. One American coloured soldier was killed and the other captured.3 11. General Humayuni has now embarked on phase 3 of his Arab isai mament operation by despatching two companies of infantry, one machine on 11 S? m P an ^. 0I ? e bakery of 75-mm. guns from Khorramshahr to Pul-i-Nau. ihe bheiks of Mahaissen, Deris, ISaser, Bahmanshir and Abadan have been called and have agreed to surrender rifles.

About 2,000 Reki families also prepared to migrate to British Baluchistan. The General Officer Commanding, Kerman Garrison, accompanied by two Reki sardars, went to Khwash and was successful in allaying the fears of the Rekis. The situation is returning to normal. &amp; British Interests. 13. A detachment of the Arab Gulf R.A.F. levies recently mutinied at Jask. Thirty-one out of fifty-nine men deserted with their arms and 5,000 rounds of ammunition. A party of Assyrian levies has been flown to Jask and the disband- 1 m 6 n t of the remainder of the detachment (most of whom are believed to be ! Persians) has been effected. 14. Major-General W. A. K. Fraser, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., M.V.O., M.C., military attache, left Tehran on the 27th January for London on d’utv for a’liaison visit to the War Office. 15.

Colonel Huang Tzi An has arrived in Tehran to replace Colonel Tang le-Hang, who will be leaving shortly for China.

He has held numerous staff appointments, mostly on the operations directorate of the National Military Council. American Interests. 17.

As many false statements have been published regarding an incident at the internment camp in the 500-bed hospital, the British Embassy considers it necessary to state the facts. The incident occurred when a British officer, in the normal execution of his duty, went to the camp to call the roll. When, as a mark of confidence, it was arranged that the internees at Sultanabad whose interrogation had been completed should be transferred to Tehran, no provision was made for a roll-call because it was expected that the Persian authorities concerned would observe the agreement strictly. It was soon found, however, that the internees were allowed to go out into the town and even to stay away from the camp for days at a time, without e\en the knowledge of the security authorities, and it therefore became necessary to institute a roll-call. But for this the Persian officer in question would not have had to appear for a roll-call and would not have made certain excited remarks which led to the incident. It is not true that a British officer has made an apology in connexion with this incident. There was no ground for an apology and none will be given. It should be added that the visit of the British officer to effect the roll-call revealed yet another serious breach of the regulations under which the internees 7 e u e -ij anS { err t d t0 Tehr{ P- Although it was a Thursday, when the internees are tqrbidden by the regulations to receive visitors, there were, in fact a number of visitors in the camp.of ^XSCJCsl r 1 W^Ps GftZd. v r ifc-— w THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. a ^ February 16, 1945. \ [ &lt;o.

The affair of Dr. Millspaugh still drags on. The obstinate doctor has further played into the hands of his enemies by a renewed insistence on the dismissal of A. H. Ibtehaj, the Governor of the National Bank, and by a further request that, according to the terms of the law by which he was engaged, all economic functions should be placed again in his charge. This letter is now under examination by the Council of Ministers and the Persian Prime Minister has announced in the Majlis that, as the doctor’s recommendations cannot be accepted, there is no need to refer the matter to the Majlis for arbitration as previously announced (see paragraph 7 (iii) of Summary No. 4). The Majlis. 2. The chief business has been as follows :— (i) A statement by Fahimi, Minister without portfolio, on his recent tour 1 of inspection in Kurdistan. He stressed the loyalty and patriotism of the Kurds and mentioned the need for increased medical and educational facilities; (ii) The passing of two Bills (with double urgency procedure) tabled by the Minister of Health. The first empowers the Ministry of Health to enforce all public health regulations previously enforced by the Ministry of the Interior. The second Bill was for the preparation of a two-year plan for the reorganisation of the Ministry of Health after approval by the Majlis Public Health commission; (iii) The tabling of a private member’s Bill for the prohibition of the cultivation of opium; (iv) A spirited discussion arising out of a remark by the Azarbaijan Tudeh Deputy Oyanessian to the effect that, as far as Persia was concerned, the Atlantic Charter was a £c scrap of paper (v) A parliamentary question by Dr. Musaddiq (Musaddiq-us-Saltaneh) regarding the legality of the interning of certain Persians suspected of anti-Allied activities. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, though supplied by the British and Russian Ambassadors with ample material for a convincing reply, made a weak statement in which 'no mention was made of the seriousness of the offences or of the possibilitv that death sentences would have been passed on some of the internees if they had been brought to trial instead of being interned He said [62 60] ^ Bthat, while no legal grounds existed for then “^[T^gatYons as moral iustiflcation for internment in view of Persia s obligations as an Ally He further said that efforts had been made and would continue to be made to procure the release of those whose guilt was not adjudged to be serious. The Press. 3. The chief topics of discussion have been (i) The forthcoming conference of the three Allied leaders and the belief that the problem of Persia would be one of the mam items on he (ii) Further attacks by the Russian-inspired press on the tribal bloc m the south and the rearming of the tribes by imperialists and reactionaries (iii) The third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Treaty. Most of the articles stress the fact that as Persia had undertaken and fulfilled certain obligations so she should obtain corresponding benefits. Though she had sent no soldiers to the front her people had woiked on Allied communications and had made Persia the bridge to victory ”; . (iv) The usual attacks on Sa’ed’s “one-sided policy, on Seyyid Zia and, more recently, on Bayat, the Prime Minister, for his failure to achieve anything; . (v) Gratification at the impending withdrawal of American troops and the hope that Russian and British troops would soon follow suit. 4. The tone of the Persian press has become so bad lately and abuse of the | Allies so frequent that a joint approach to the Minister for Foreign Affairs was 1 made by the British and Russian Ambassadors. The Minister for Foreign Affairs attempted to defend the press by saying that their abuse was only provoked by acts of unwarranted interference by the Allies in the internal affairs of Persia and so served a useful turn by drawing public attention to these acts. It was pointed out to him that the press, at the level at which it worked in Persia, was not the best judge of what constituted unwarranted interference. Finance. 5. An extract from a report dated the 30th January, 1945, by the Financial Counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassy is published as an appendix to this summary. 6. His Majesty’s Government have stopped the sale of gold to Persia with effect from the 15th January, 1945. The market had reached saturation point and most of the gold recently sold had been smuggled out of Persia into Iraq. As the supply of goods and rial notes in Iraq had also diminished, Iraqi dinar notes in payment of this smuggled gold were being brought into Persia, thus increasing Persia’s sterling balances and, hence, His Majesty’s Government’s obligations to convert 60 per cent, of these holdings into gold. A ppointments. 7.—(i) Said Samii to be Governor-General of the 4th Ustan (Western Azarbaijan) vice Colonel Darakhshani who becomes General Officer Commanding Azarbaijan Division; (ii) Muhammad Hussain Muhtashami to be Governor of Tabriz; (iii) Jamshid Qarib to be First Secretary to the Persian Embassy at Angora; (iv) Mahmud Mir Fakhrai to be Secretary to the Persian Legation in Brazil vice Khushnawis recalled. Persian Army. 8. The High Military Council, whose meetings General Razmara contrived to suspend, is now functioning again. Its members comprise the Minister for War, the Deputy Minister for War (General Muqtadir), the Chief of the General Staff, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff (General Ansari), General Yazdan Panah, the Secretary of the Shah’s Military Cabinet (General Riazi), and the General Officer Commanding the 2nd Division (General Muzayyini).3 * Internal Security. Azarbaijan. 9. With reference to Summary No. 4/45, paragraph 9, further details of the proceedings of the Tudeh conference have been received. 142 delegates attended. [ . 43,000 members are claimed for eastern Azarbaijan alone and 7,000 for the city of Tabriz. The resolutions passed may be summarised as follows : To oppose imperialism and a one-sided foreign policy; to establish provincial committees; to defend workers and peasants against the oppression of local authorities and landlords; to combat unemployment; to urge the exploitation of the province’s mineral resources; to work for the abolition of oppressive legislation passed under Reza Shah’s regime. The conference also pledged its friendship to the Soviets and for all small nations fighting for freedom. The conference also thanked the Kurds for their offer to co-operate with the Tudeh for the benefit of Persia. These thanks appear to have been cheaply earned, as the fifteen Kurdish chiefs summoned to Tabriz refused to attend the conference. Kurdistan. 10. Some months ago a party of fifteen Roghzadeh Jaf tribesmen were lured into Sennandaj by false promises on the part of the local Persian military commander, Hushmand Afshar. They were thrown into prison and their sheep and other belongings stolen. They were forced to sign a document admitting their guilt in having entered Persia under arms. They were never brought to trial. They were kept in conditions of barbarous severity and two of their number died. Protests by the Government of Iraq have led to the promise of their release in a week’s time. They have been told to remove their property but have protested that most of it has been stolen. Khuzistan. 11. The Persian Government has been issuing passports for pilgrims to Kerbela without ascertaining from the Iraqi Consulate the numbers of applicants for visas with which they could cope. They have also been running three special pilgrim trains to Ahwaz per week without concerning themselves with the arrangements for the onward transport of pilgrims from Ahwaz to Iraq. The resulting accumulation of pilgrims without food or shelter in Ahwaz is causing the local authorities much concern. Many pilgrims, tired of waiting their turn at the Iraqi Consulate, will have gone south without Iraqi visas, and the trade of the Shatt-el-Arab boatmen in smuggling them across at extortionate rates is likely to be a brisk one. 12. The military governor of Abadan met the sheikhs of south-east Abadan on the 29th January and obtained promises from them to hand over their arms. While complying with the military governor’s orders the sheikhs pointed out that they would remain at the mercy of the tribes on the Arab side of the Shatt-el-Arab who still retain their arms Mekran. \ 13. Security around Zahidan has deteriorated and further hold-ups have been reported. The area near Hormuk is particularly bad owing to its proximity to the Afghan border and the numerous safe exits afforded to bandits by the tangled mass of hills near Kuh-i-Malik Siah. Turkish Interests. 14. Jahid Hayta, Second Secretary to the Turkish Embassy, Tehran, has been transferred to Rome. Russian Interests. 15. Major-General I. V. Kargin, Chief of the Soviet Transport Directorate and commander of all Russian personnel in Tehran, has returned to Moscow on completion of his appointment. His successor is Colonel Kostikov, who is [62—60] b 2carrying out the same duties previously performed by Major-General Kargin. Major-General Zorriri, Chief of the Iransovtrans, is occupied with that organisation only and is not commander of Soviet troops in Tehran. Appendix.

I he figures of revenue and expenditure for the first nine months of the financial year 1944-45 (beginning on the 21st March 1944—the Persian year 13-3 A.H.) are now available.

For one thing, the expenditure does not mciude the salaries of Government servants for the ninth month (some 200 million nals) The budget, although submitted to the Parliament (Mailis) last June, has not yet been approved, and the expenditure is being authorised in the meantime by periodical votes on account, the last (like some of the others) having been passed too late for the punctual payment of salaries. More important, however is the fact that receipts from income tax, which were estimated at 885 million rials ior the year, are likely to fall far short of this figure. Although the rates are con- higher than m 1943-44, receipts in Tehran have been no more than 84 million rials in the first nine months of the year, compared with 273 million in the same period of the preceding year, and this figure has only been reached because In 6 'f,r me . f Pal&lt;1 V 1 * Nattonal Bank has amounted to 140 million as against 41 million last year.

Persian Affairs. Political. 1. The latest steps taken by Dr. Millspaugh to retain his post have not been very dignified. Having received no answer to his letter to the Persian Prime Minister (referred to in paragraph 1 of last Intelligence Summary) he addressed another in which he said that, as he had received no reply, he understood that his demands had not been acceptable and that m consequence he tendered his resignation. Subsequently he wrote yet another letter to the 1 ersian 1 nme Minister in which he accused him of participating in attacks and criticisms designed to expel him from the country and sabotage the work of his financial mission. He finally appealed to the Majlis to arbitrate on the justice of his case. On the 6th February Bayat made a long speech to the Majlis in which he gave details of the correspondence between himself and Dr. Millspaugh. His state ment to the effect that the Persian Government could no longer work with Dr Millspaugh on any conditions was greeted with cheers. 2 Bayat’s position as Persian Prime Minister has further deteriorated, and there are but few who would estimate his chances of retaining office at more than a few weeks or who would regret his passing. The Parliamentary fractions are already busy in making their selections for a new cabinet. 1 he qualifications demanded of any future Prime Minister are not easy to find. He must be accept able to the Shah, the Majlis, the Russians and the British and, with vested interests as strong as they are at present in Persia, be a man who can be trusted not to show reforming zeal in putting an end to a state of administrative (haos from which a great many classes of the population derive advantage. 3 TPg r rudeh party have not slackened their efforts in Isfahan. Dr. Kishawarz and Kambaksh are reported to have left for Tehran but their place has been taken by Dr. Radmanish and Iraj Iskandari. The Soviet Consul is active on their behalf and battle has now been joined with the two rival unions supported respectively by the mill owners and Daulatabadi. It is reported that Yezd is to be the next scene for Tudeh activities . , ^ 4. A reliable report discloses a strong Tudeh element in the Persian Broad casting Department. w i 4 - • 41 5 The Military Governor has published two proclamations concerning the suppression of four newspapers and the necessity for registration by immigrants. (It is thought that this last edict is directed against a number of Caucasians who. it is rumoured, have been imported by the Russians to swell the ranks of the Tudeh party.)

Fifty Ismailzais have been recruited into the Mekran gendarmerie. A hundred Bakhtiaris were enlisted in 1944 (see Intelligence Summary No. 42/44, paragraph 11), and Colonel Schwarzkopf has intentions of accepting Qashgai and, eventually, other tribesmen. Economic. 8. The Cabinet has received the report of the special commission set up to advise on the reorganisation of Persia’s economic administrations. A Bill embodying the commission’s recommendations is to be presented to the Majlis at once. 9.

Strikes have been reported from Isfahan, Ahwaz and Yezd. In most cases the owners were prepared to grant benefits in the form of shorter hours and better hygienic facilities, but were not prepared to raise existing wages. Educational. 11. The first group of eleven Iranian students selected to study at Indian universities will leave Tehran shortly. Four will complete their training at Lyallpur Agricultural College (Punjab) and two at the Rangers College, Dehra Dun, for forestry. Three of the group will take a course of high engineering at Delhi University, while the remainder will study in the Textile Department of Delhi University. The entire cost will be borne by the Government of India. Internal Security. Bakktiari. 12. Morteza Quli Khan has not yet obeyed the summons to come to the capital to discuss the proposed operations against the Bahmai and Tayebi.

[E 1516/70/34] Copy No. i Tehran, l§th February, 1945. Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 7 for the Period \2th-\%th February, 1945. (Secret.) — + —— Political. Persian Affairs - THE Tudeh party’s activities in the provinces have been much in the news recently. In Yazd the anti-Tudeh party of Dr. Tahiri sacked and burnt the Tudeh headquarters, attacked the Tudeh leaders and chased them out of the town. The instigator. of the strikes referred to in paragraph 10 of last Intelligence Summary, Abbas Ustadan, escaped from the first affray but was later caught and wounded. In Azerbaijan, as a result of the recent Tudeh conference, a Tudeh recruiting drive has started among the townsfolk of Tabriz, the peasants and the Kurdish tribes. The enthusiasm of the latter for the Tudeh cause has probably been much exaggerated by the wealthy burghers, who fear for their property and skins. It is unlikely that the Kurds have any affinity with the Tudeh’s Russian masters. In a separationist movement culminating, possibly, in the formation of an Azerbaijan Soviet republic the Kurds would hold no favoured place, but they would stand to benefit, temporarily, in a state of chaos between the withdrawal of Russian troops and the reassertion of Persian Government authority—a period during which they could indulge in their predatory habits to the full. The Shakkaq tribe has been the main recipient for Tudeh propaganda and is under the leadership of Taha Agha, son of the notorious rebel Simko, who was killed at Ushnu in 1930. In Hamadan the party has shown more activity of late, and, though Hamadan is not an industrial centre, a number of artisans recently thrown out of employment there by the diminution of Allied Aid-to-Russia activities may present a worth-while target. In Isfahan strikes and street-fighting continue and Persian troops were recently called out in aid of the civil power. To offset these provincial activities, an unconfirmed report states that Tudeh membership in the capital has declined from 15.000 to 1,000 and that the weekly meetings are attended by only 150 as against the average of 500 of some months ago. The reason for this falling off is said to be the Russian-escorted Tudeh demonstrations of October last, as a result of which it became manifest to all Persians that the Tudeh was no longer (if ever it had been) a genuine Persian labour movement but a Russian-controlled political movement. The Majlis. 2. A press report gives the strength of the various Majlis groups as follows :— Ittihad-i-Milli (National Unionists) ... 30 Democrats 8 Azadi (Freedom Front) 11 Independents 16 Tudeh (Labour) 8 Mihan (Fatherland) 23 Ungrouped 31 127 48] ' 1 SFi COS VA/&gt; VAC*~£. • A nrA merican Financial Mission. 3.

On the 11th February six bandits held up twenty-one lorries (including a Persian mail lorry) 12 miles from Meshed on the Turbat-i-Haidari road and decamped with 20,000 tomans. This is said to be the first act of highway robbery on this road since December 1943. » j .7 6 Smuggling into Afghanistan on a large scale of A.I.O.C. and Russian petrol and kerosene has been brought to light by the A.I.O.C. manager in Meshed. High Russian and 1 ei sian officials are said to have connived at this. The Russians have doubtless used these products to produce rials or to barter them for livestock. Qashgai. 7. The Darashuri have been raiding recently near Gach Saran but following representations by the A.I.O.C., have removed themselves from the area and promised compensation for losses inflicted. Kuh-i-Galu. 8. The situation is still disturbed, where Muhammad Khan Ariani of the Boir Ahmad Sarhaddi is at loggerheads with his nephew Zargham Ariani. The Bavi tribe has joined in the fray by coming to the assistance of the latter. Bakhtiari. 9 Reference paragraph 12 of the last Intelligence Summary, Morteza Quh Khan has refused to come to Tehran and gives as his reason that both he and General Humayuni think it too late in the season to start operations to disarm the Bahmai and Taiyebi. Morteza Quli Khan has stipulated for a daily payment 20 and 30 rials respectively for every foot soldier and horse soldier which he provides. Their rations and arms are to be supplied by the Persian Government He undertakes to provide 400 infantry and 200 cavalry. General Humayuni is of the opinion that his own forces are inadequate and is, moreover, nervous about hostile repercussions among the Kuhgalu in his rear. It is doubtful whether the known enthusiasm for these operations on the part of the Shah and the Chief of the General Staff will succeed in overcoming the objections now raised bv Morteza Quli Khan and General Humayuni. British Interests, 10 Three members of a British parliamentary delegation which has toured Soviet Russia recently passed through Tehran on 'their way home. They were Commander King-Hall, Mr. Jewson and Mr. Manningham Buller. While in * me f. a number of newspaper editors and a representative selection of Majlis Deputies.

Tehran, ^th February, 1945. (Secret.) Enclosure. Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 8 for the Period \§th February to ^bth February, 1945. Persian A ffairs. The Majlis. 1. The chief business has been :— (i) The tabling by the Minister of Finance of a Bill empowering Govern ment to return to their rightful owners lands and properties unlaw fully confiscated from the tribes and other landowners. The wording of the Bill is woolly and vague, and in its present form it is, like most Persian legislation, quite impracticable. (ii) Passing of the Bill to provide credits for the months of Bahman and Isfand—21st January to the 21st March—(two-twelfths of the budget). (iii) The tabling by the Persian Prime Minister of two Bills to provide for the formation of agricultural councils and for the development of Persian agriculture. The text of the former has been received and will be published is this summary when the Bill is passed. It looks imposing enough on paper, but the lack of the necessary funds, energy and knowledge will probably prevent its ever being of any practical use. Obituary. 2. By the death on the 24th February of Hassan Esfandiari Haji Muhtashim-us-Saltaneh (F.0.99; M.A. 125) a notable landmark of modern Persia has disappeared. Appointments. 3. Sartip Gulshayan, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, to be a Military Governor of Tehran vice Sartip Kazim Shaibani. The reason for the change is said to be Shaibani’s inactivity in general and his neglect of duty in particular on the occasion of a riot at Muharram when he failed to visit the scene in person and finally despatched a force so inadequate that it was overpowered by the crowd and one soldier was killed. The incoming Military Governor, though pleasant mannered and intelligent, is not remarkable for his energy. Persian Army. 4. The Conscription Law continues to be debated and amended. One criticism of the existing procedure seems justified. Owing to Government’s temporary inability to enforce conscription in areas not under its control {i.e., the Russian occupied zone and the fringes of tribal territory where its writ no [63-87] |ITA S 0*1 MAY f IMH! &amp; f 1 IPiUitt vlonger runs) the annual call-up in other areas exceeds the army s requirements. Where a surplus exists, conscription is effected by casting lots. lb° se . w b° are not taken only receive exemption for one year and may also in following years be fortunate enough to escape. They do not, however, receive permanent exemption and have the disturbing liability hanging over their heads for a number of years. The greater the number of possible conscripts the greater is the opportunity for rigging the casting of lots and the exemption, after payment of a suitable bribe, of the fit and the intake of the physically second rate. Persian Navy. 5. After repeated requests by the Persian Government for the return of all or some of their naval craft still afloat, the Royal Navy has agreed to the return of the admiral’s barge and two motor launches after repair. While these if efficiently handled, may go some way towards prevention of smuggling and frontier control in the Shatt-el-Arab they will not suffice for other needs said by the Persian Government to be equally pressing, i.e., general preventive duties'and as a means of communication between the scattered garrisons along the whole Persian coast from Bushire to Jask. Internal Security. Bakhtiari. 6. The Chief of the General Staff has decided .to postpone till a more suitable occasion the operations for disarming the Bahmai and Taiyebi for the reasons given in paragraph 9 of the last Intelligence Summary. According to a consular report, General Humayuni has submitted an alternative proposal to disarm the Hajiwand sub-tribe of the Chahar Lang Division of the Bakhtiari. This alternative proposal has not yet reached the Persian General Staff. It will require examination for two reasons. Firstly, at this late season, the Hajiwand will soon be starting their upward migration to their summer grazing grounds near the Ushtarinan Kuh, thus putting themselves beyond the reach of their attackers. Secondly, the Hajiwand live, both in their winter and summer grazing grounds, in close proximity to another sub-tribe of the Chahar Lang (also an off-shoot of the Fuladwand tribe), the Hivedi, to whom it is believed the murderers of Mr. Vice-Consul Harris and Dr. Griffiths and his son belong. His Majesty’s Embassy has been pressing the Persian Government for more than two years to bring these murderers to justice, and their reply, so far, has been to the effect that their habitat is not under Government’s control. If military operations against the Hajiwand are considered feasible it is difficult to see why the Hivedi should be regarded as beyond the reach of a punitive column. Isfahan. 7. A number of persons have been arrested by the Persian military authori ties for smuggling arms. One of them was a member of the Tudeh party. One unconfirmed report says that vehicles of Iransovtrans were used for the purpose. The above information is especially interesting in view of the numerous reports in the Tudeh press of late to the effect that “ Mysterious Hands,” “ Fascists, Imperialists ” and “ Reactionaries ” were busy arming the tribes of the south. 8. On the 15th February some fifty members of the Tudeh ambushed a car containing Abbas Quli Dehesh, a factory owner, and Saif pur Fatemi, the Majlis Deputy. On the timely arrival of a party of soldiers about twenty members of the gang were arrested, among whom was the local Tudeh leader, Bahrampur. The Soviet consul, Marchenko, demanded his release frorfi the Governor-General and, on being treated to some plain speaking by the latter, demanded the recall of the Governor-General and some other officials. The Governor-General, who seems to have behaved with admirable firmness, courage and impartiality throughout, has asked his Government to procure the recall of Marchenko. The situation is tense with Tudeh and anti-Turkish factions spoiling for a fight. Kuh-i-Galu. 9. Some progress has been made in settling the disputes between Abdullah Khan Zarghampur and his half-brother, Khosro. The former was last reported to be near Behbehan, but to be reluctant to enter the town without some form 1 of British guarantee.Kurdistan. 10. On the 15th February a crowd of Kurds attacked the police station at Mahabad (Saujbulagh) and attempted to loot the Finance Department’s offices. Five policemen and a Kurd were killed. The ringleader of the Kurds, Aziz of the Faizullahbegi tribe, in an inflammatory speech, urged the expulsion of all Persian officials and claimed to speak as a pro-Russian, pro-Communist Nationalist. According to a Russian source the Kurds were enraged at the unfair distribution of monopoly goods. On the 14th February, at a village a few miles north of Rezaieh a small detachment of Persian infantry on tactical training encountered a party of Herki Kurds. The latter opened fire and the commander of the Persian detachment, a Major Mafi, rashly charged them and was killed. According to a Persian General Staff report, as yet unconfirmed from consular sources, the Persian detachment a day or two later located these same Kurds in position on a hill north-west of Rezaieh on the Rezaieh-Shahpur road and attacked them inflicting casualties of fifty killed and wounded with no loss to themselves. The Persian Government feel particularly sore with the I Russians over the first incident because the Russians, though they withdrew their garrison from Mahabad some time ago, refused to' allow the Persian army to install their own. A battalion of Persian infantry has been moved from Saqqiz to Bukan about 35 miles south of Mahabad and, if Russian permission is obtained, this battalion will subsequently move on and garrison Mahabad. Khuzistan. 11. A fairly reliable estimate of the arms recovered in phases 3, 4 and 5 of General Humayuni’s operations against the Arabs of Khorramshahr and Abadan, Shedgan and Khalafabad is 1,300, 750 and 400 respectively. French Interests. 12. General Catroux, French Ambassador to the U.S.S.R., passed through Tehran on his way to Moscow. He was received in audience by His Imperial Majesty the Shah. 13. The Persian Military Mission referred to in paragraph 18 of Intelligence Summary No. 49 of 1944 is scheduled to leave Tehran on the 1st March, 1945.

Political. Persian Affairs. DR. MILLSPAUGH left Tehran on the 28th February and, unless he is rash enough to try and write another apologia as a sequel to “ The American j? aS jL m , rs | a ’ which he published after the completion of his previous tenure ot office, the hubbub may be expected to die down. 2. Persia declared war on Japan with effect from the 28th February. 3 Bayat’s position has strengthened slightly during the past two weeks. Inability among the Majlis parties to agree on a successor and a disinclination to mar the festivities of the Nau Ruz, now approaching, may be the chief causes Dr. Musaddiq may have strengthened Bayat’s position by a speech in which he referred to the current trend of thought in the Majlis with regard to the Government :•—&lt; For several days it had been quite clear that the Government was not m very great favour with the Majlis, but reasons for opposition to the Government should be clearly stated; if the Government was bad then it should go, but if not then it should receive full support. If the Government had to go great attention should be paid to its successor. Persia of to-day found herself living in a period when the leaders of great nations gathered together, took important decisions and drew up world plans, and if Persians really gave serious thought to Persia's position in international politics at a time when the slightest negligence would bring down great misfortune on Persia, they would be bound to confess that it was necessary for the Majlis to be respected, and for a clear and permanent policy to be established which would settle disturbed public opinion on the one hand, and which would enable Persia to deal with current important international problems with success on the other. Exactly what the present Government had achieved, good or bad, should be clearly defined; the Government had kept its promise to abrogate Millspaugh’s powers and had thus rendered great service to Persia. If it was proved necessary that the Government should go then the Majlis should take care to avoid a political crisis and should not appoint an inefficient successor.” Financial. 4. The budget for the Persian year 1324—the 21st March, 1945, to the 20th March, 1946—is to be tabled shortly. Expenditure is believed to be round about 400 million tomans (approximately £31 million). 5. The Treasury is empty and Government salaries are one month in arrears. A ppointments — Civil. 6. (i) Jawad Sadr to be first Secretary and Consul at the Persian Consu late-General at Jerusalem. (ii) Dr. Abul Qasim Sheikh has been presented to the Majlis as Under secretary to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Mines. Persian A rmy. 7. The conscription bill is still being debated and one of the latest amend ments proposed is to reduce the period of compulsory military service from two years to one. With administration and training at their present levels this would render conscription a farce. Between a quarter and a third of the con scripts on joining know only Turki and take six months or a year to learn [64—44] 2^ WAV2 sufficient Persian to understand the orders given. The amendment is also very unpopular with officers who, quick to select as batmen the more presentable and intelligent and the handymen from each draft, thus secured for themselves two years’ free domestic service. 8. Sarhang Khodadad, General Officer Commanding the 8th Khorrassan Division, has been recalled to Tehran to answer charges made against him and his officers of peculation especially in the matter of certain recent disarmament operations near Kuchan. A commission had recently gone to Meshed to inves tigate these rumours. Sarhang Khodadad had been favourably noticed by His Majesty's Consul-General for Khorrassan, and it is known that he was not regarded with favour by the Russians. He was, moreover, a nominee of General Razmara. Persian Air Force. 9. General Ahmad Nakchevan (F.O. 159; M.A. 193) and Colonel Siahpush have returned to Persia from their tour in the United States. Their itinerary was a lengthy one and they were lavishly entertained. They are reported as {having been greatly impressed with American factory war production but not at all with the war effort in general. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 10. The small force which the Chief of the General Staff had ordered to proceed to Bukan has not, as yet, arrived. It is to be larger than the single battalion as stated in paragraph 10 of Intelligence Summary No. 8/45 and is to consist, in addition, of a squadron of cavalry, a section of tanks and a mortar detachment. General Hushmand Afshar has not yet assembled this column from his scattered command. Amir Asad of the Deboukri Kurds has been instructed by Af^har to collect his followers and meet him at Mahabad. Uncertainty as to the Russians’ reactions, the known enmity between Ghazi Muhammad of Mahabad and Amir Asad, the evil reputation of General Hushmand. Afshar among the Kurds and, lastly, the intention of Colonel Schwarzkopf to form a gendarmerie battalion at Mahabad, of which Kurds will form the majority, are all factors which may produce some startling results in the neighbourhood. Kuh-i-Galu. 11. Abdullah Zarghampur, according to a consular report, has arrived at Behbehan and, from a message sent in by General Humayuni, seems prepared to submit to the Government. It is to be hoped that General Humayuni's moderate outlook (moderate, that is to say, in comparison with other Persian Generals) and his knowledge of his own Government’s weakness will induce him to propose terms which, while securing tranquillity for the area, will not prove too onerous for Abdullah’s acceptance. Isfahan. 12. The situation is reported as quieter and there have been no more disturbances. Shiraz. 13. The Russian Consul at Isfahan, Mr. Marchenko, accompanied by the Assistant Russian Military Attache and two agricultural experts, visited Shiraz between the 10th and the 17th February. Mr. Marchenko was very curious and his questions to the Persian officials and His Majesty’s Consul covered a wide range of subjects. He asked for information about the tribes; the reported smuggling of arms to them from Koweit and Bahrein; the real reasons underlying the reconciliation between Nasir Khan Qashgai and the Qavam; the training and administration of the Persian army; the establishment of the British Consulate; the capacity of the local hospitals; local political parties; the local press and even the number of converts made by the Church Missionary Society. 14. Khosro and Muhammad Hussein Qashgai have left Teihran for Shiraz. It remains to be seen whether they will attempt to persuade Nasir Khan to come to Tehran to make his peace with His Imperial Majesty The Shah and whether Nasir Khan will consider it as a trap. There are grounds for believing that Nasir Khan regards Khosro with suspicion as attempting to undermine his authority with the Qashgai and also as a convert to the Tudeh.3 British Interests. 15. The remainder of the British Parliamentary Delegation (see paragraph 10 of Intelligence Summary No. 7/45) has passed through Tehran. While here they were entertained at the Majlis, where they met the Cabinet Ministers and Deputies. This part of the delegation consisted of the following:— Colonel The Right Honourable Walter Elliot, M.P. Colonel C. E. Ponsonby, M.P. Mr. Wilfred Roberts, M.P. Lord Farringdon, M.P. Mr. T. Fraser, M.P. Mr. John Parker, M.P. French Interests. 16. The motion to renew for a further period of five years the contract of Mr. Paul Godard, the Director of Archaeology, has caused a stir. To most foreign observers Mr. Paul Godard, a mild and genial savant, encouraged by his talented and energetic wife, had rendered good service to Persia during his tenure. Some papers have now come out strongly against him. Not only did xenophobia express itself in demanding the appointment of a Persian, but Mr. Godard has been accused of selling improperly, smuggling out of the country and even converting to his own use articles of value excavated by him at various sites in Persia. Armenian Religious Interests. 17. A Soviet national, Vahar Kestanian, has been elected by the religious authorities at Ectchmiadzin to the vacant Archbishopric of Isfahan (Julfa). His see comprises all Persia (except Tabriz), India, Burma and the Netherlands East Indies.

His supporters had been falling away rapidly. His relative and supporter, Dr. Alusaddiq, had come in for much unfavourable notice on account of a speech in the Alajhs and an episode arising out of it which is described in a later paragraph in this summary. The Tudeh party, having achieved their object in getting rid of Dr. Millspaugh, had no further use for Bayat. the Shah is reputed to be very displeased with him for accepting the Presidency of the Irano-So\iet Cultural Society and for being bounced by the Russians into giving a large recep tion in honour of the Red army at the premises of the Persian Officers Club, to which not only Persians but members of the diplomatic corps and Allied officers were invited. The Independent and Freedom factions in the Alajlis had decided to join forces to oppose the Government. Up to date there is no clear indication of who his successor will be, but it is rumoured that the various factions ha\e already ruled out as unsuitable two possibilities in the shape of Soheili and Rajab Ali Mansour, at present Governor of Khorrassan. 2. On the 4th March, in the course of a debate on the submission of reports by Majlis commissions, a Deputy objected to a previous remark by Dr. Alussadiq to the effect that the Majlis Justice Commission had acquitted an embezzler in acquitting Tadayyun, who had been impeached for accepting bribes in con nexion with the last elections. Dr. Musaddiq requested that Padayyun s dossier should be placed at his disposal for fifteen days, by the end of which period he undertook to find ample evidence of Tadayyun’s guilt. He was told that, as a Deputy, he had the right to study the dossier in the Alajlis but not to remove it. The doctor, in one of 'his hysterical outbursts, demanded a vote on his proposal but was shouted down. In a fit of rage he left the chamber turning at the door to remark that the Alajlis was a den of thieves. This unpalatable truth estranged many of his, and hence Bayat’s, supporters. On the 6th Alarch a crowd of young students, having heard of Dr. Musaddiq’s outburst and refusal to attend the ALajlis, persuaded the hysterical demagogue to allow himself to be carried by them in procession to the Alajlis. A posse of soldiers, drawn up at the gates to prevent the entry of this crowd, opened fire after, it is said, a shot had been fired at them by an unknown person in the crowd. In the inane fashion prevalent in the Persian army when called out in aid of the civil power, the troops fired a few rounds over the heads of the rioters and thereby killed a young student who was peacefully watching the scene from the balcony of his house some distance away. An enquiry into the incident is being held and, in the meanwhile Sartip Gulshayan, the newly-appointed Alilitary Governor of Tehran, has been suspended, and Colonel Shah Rais, his deputy, is officiating. 3. Some publicity has been given of late in the Persian press to the closing of the internee’s camp at Rasht and deductions were drawn to show that, despite the Russians’ magnanimity, the British continued to keep their numerous internees in Tehran. To counteract this mischievous propaganda a press communique has been issued by His Majesty’s Embassy, which explains that internees are held jointly and that the British and Russian security authorities work in the closest co-operation. 4. H.I.M. the Shah, in an interview given recently to the representative of M.O.I, the Evening Standard newspaper, stated that the best course for Persia to pursue was to abstain from all negotiations or treaties leading to the according of economic, financial and commercial concessions with other countries as long as foreign troops were on Persian soil. *u~.,“ [64—26] .L. 4 I2 5. The Deputy Masudi asked for information in the Majlis on the 4th March regarding the rumoured arming of the Southern tribes. The Prime Minister, previously supplied with ample material by His Majesty’s Embassy for a convincing answer, gave a much watered-down version in reply. He stated that such false rumours only served to weaken confidence in Government and were without foundation. He admitted that the tribes were plentifully supplied with arms which they had acquired on the disintegration of the Persian army at the time of the entry of British and Russian .troops. Furthermore, a trickle oi smuggled arms had always reached the tribes and would doubtless always continue to do so despite the vigilance of the. preventive service. He assured the Majlis that the Government was pursuing a gradual policy of disarmament. He reassured the Majlis that the recent pact between certain tribal leaders made for added security and was not in any way directed against the Government. Financial. at' budget. Ihe Finance Minister tabled a single article budget bill in the Majlis on the 4th March. Income was shown as 4,412,200,000 rials and expendi ture as 4,412,170,000 rials. As the last year’s budget was never passed, and this year s budget may meet a similar fate, it is reproduced for purposes of re erence as an Appendix to this summary. Army expenditure consisting of the ? ioS ^ 0 « 000 and Conscription Department at nals, and Ministry of War requirements from United States” at 96,000 000 rials, total 1,097,400,000 rials and represent 25 per cent of the total I^onn non 6 ' • Ur f® 8 ’ 24 , 6 ’ 100 rlal f. added for the gendarmerie vote a^d 2S 7 000 OGO rials for the police vote there is some justification for the criticisms siurtty fo°e e s PUtleS ^ erS ‘ a iS S P endin g more than sh e can afford on her Economic. marJwJT'fknv the me ^ her ? °. f the economic council (see paragraph 8 of Sum- “fVL ? 5 ) ha ''?. resl g ned ' giving as their reason the unwarranted interference of the Ministry of Finance in the economic sphere.

The proposal to reduce the period of compulsory service for conscripts from two years to one year has been rejected by the Military Affairs Committee of the Majlis. * 11. Colonel Atapur, C.B.E. (late military attache in London), has returned from his tour of inspection in those areas of Khuzistan where disarming opera tions have recently taken place. This unbalanced and embarrassingly anglo- phile officer 'fras warned before his departure against excessive zeal and the folly of saying what he believed, i.e., that everyone of his countrymen was a thief, his country on the brink of disaster and that its only salvation lay in the immediate acceptance of a British mandate for an indefinite period. His report is couched in moderate terms and merely accuses General Humayuni of making reasonable profits out of the allowances for his troops’ rations; out of the distribution of monopoly goods among the tribes and out of forewarnin 0 * tribes of coming disarmament. 12. The Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff state that they are determined to check and punish corruption in the army and that the summoning to Tehran to answer charges of peculation of Colonel Khodadad from Khorrassan and Colonel Shahrukhshahi from Kermanshah are the first steps in that direction. The appointment of Colonel Dehimi as public prosecutor in place of the allegedly dishonest Colonel Shah Quli is, they say, another earnest of their endeavours. If these charges are proved and the officers punished the deterrent effect should be good, but the apparent impossibility of securing a conviction in Persia and the fact that the two officers recalled and also the outgoing public prosecutor were friends of General Razmara (and hence enemies of General Arfa) detract from the value of the protestations of the Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff. Internal Security. A zarbaijan. 13. A consular report states that there are signs that the Tudeh and Workers Union have been told to draw in their horns by their Russian masters. Both have published notices condemning acts of violence committed in their names and announcing that unruly members will be expelled. A flag march of 1,200 Persian troops through Tabriz has had a steadying effect on local nerves and has done much to enhance the waning prestige of the Persian army. 14. The newspaper Iran reports that Mehdi Dadvar (Vossuq-us-Saltaneh) has been recalled. It has been known for a long time that the Persian Govern ment has been very dissatisfied at his feeble handling of the situation and his complete subservience to the Russians. Khuzistan. 15. A decline in security in the Gach Saran area is reported where Boir Ahmadi tribesmen have been damaging the A.I.O.C. telephone lines. 16. General Humayuni has been summoned to Tehran for consultations. He has left a committee sitting on the settlement of the dispute between Abdullah Zarghampur and his half brother Khosrow. He is hopeful of a settle ment by which Abdullah, in return for his submission to Government, will be recognised as Kalantar of the Boir Ahmadi Sarhaddi (lower) tribes only. Isfahan. 17. A reliable report states that Tudeh influence has suffered a severe setback, as a result of the Governor’s firm handling of the situation and the clumsy intrigues of Mr. Marchenko, the Soviet Consul. Another cause for the decline in Tudeh influence is said to be the anti-religious bias in their propaganda which has offended that respect for the truth of religion, if not for religious practices, which is latent in all Persians. 18. Correction —see paragraph 17 of last Intelligence Summary. Vahar Kestanian is to be like his predecessor, Archimandrite and not Archbishop of [64—26]4 British Interests. 19. As from Nau Ruz (21st March) the time on the Tehran radio reserved for the past three years for the service “Voice of Britain ” will be given up. It is hoped that this will assist the Persian Government in their return to normality. The Russians, therefore, will from that date be the only foreigners with a radio time reserved for themselves. « French Interests. 20. The renewal of the contract of Mr. Godard for a further period of five years was passed by the Majlis by the narrow margin of 46 votes to 43. See paragraph 16 of last Intelligence 'Summary. Polish Interests. 21. Discussions with the colonial and other authorities concerned are in progress with a view to making one more and final transfer of Poles from Persia to the number of 2,200 distributed among Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Uganda.

Bayat has not yet resigned and refuses to do so. According to one report he has threatened, if further pressure is put on him, to announce in the Majlis the names of all those Deputies who have asked him for Government posts. He also stated that the fall of the Govern ment and the long period which, in view of the approaching Nau Ruz holidays, would elapse before a new Government could be formed, would delay to Persia’s disadvantage the selection of representatives for the forthcoming San Francisco Conference. The wildest rumours are abroad Some say that the Tudeh party are keeping him in office, others that the British alone are preventing the fall of his Cabinet. Some sixty Deputies are opposed to him, but their number may increase if the various political factions can coalesce and agree on a successor. 2. Dr. Musaddiq has apologised for his angry outburst reported in para graph 2 of Intelligence Summary No. 10. He is variously reported as having explained that he did not refer specifically to the Majlis or that he did not mean to infer that all the Deputies were thieves. This apology, though hardly hand some, induced the Deputy Jemal Imami (son of the Imam Jumah of Khoi) to make his apology for slapping the face of General Gulshayan, the Military Governor at the time of the fracas at the Majlis 3. The Majlis has passed a single article bill empowering the Government to borrow 200 million rials from the National Bank to meet current expenditure. This loan is to be repaid from sums set apart for this purpose in the budget for 1324 (21st March, 1945-20th March, 1946). 4. The office of the control of foreign trade has been removed from the control of the Economic Section of the Ministry of Finance and placed under the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Mines. 5. Hussein Pirnia (Mutamin-ul-Mulk) (F.O. 171; M.A. 212) has refused to accept the Persian Prime Minister’s invitation to lead the Persian delegation at the forthcoming San Francisco Conference. The following names have since been put forward by the Council of Ministers as representatives :— Nasrullah Intezam : Minister of Foreign Affairs (F.O. 92; M.A. 121). Mustafa x\dl (Mansur-us-Saltaneh) : Minister of Justice (F.O. 1; M.A. 1). Hassan Taqizadeh : Persian Ambassador in London (F.O. 226; M.A. 294). Majid Ahi : Persian Ambassador in Moscow (F.O. 4; M.A. 7). 6. The Tehran Daily News of the 16th March published an account of German Fifth Column activities in Persia in the form of a press article and not a communique. The Kurds and Qashgai are specifically mentioned as implicated and Seyyid Abul Qasim Kashani and the Deputy Naubakht are mentioned by I name. It is to be hoped that this article will persuade some Persians that the i internees are not, as usually described in the Persian press, honest and patriotic : individuals wrongfully detained on grounds of ill-founded suspicion and hearsay. 7. The Minister of Finance has tabled a bill for the increase in stamp dues on bonds, cheques and other documents. Economic. 8. Musharraf Nafisi (F.O. Government Economic Council.

Political. Persian Affairs. 'fc CJO Aieu) 1. Owing to the Nauruz holidays there has been little political activity in the capital. Just before the holidays, representatives of the Majlis groups Mihan, Mustagil, Democrat, aiid Ittihad-i-Milli had an audience of the Shah and informed him of their discontent with the present Cabinet and their desire for a change. They claimed to have the support of the majority of the Deputies. It is still, however, uncertain whether the Prime Minister will resign. It is understood that the Russians oppose a change at present, since the next Prime Minister, who is unlikely to be the Russian favourite, Qavam es Sultaneh, might be less amenable and more energetic—he oould hardly be less—in the interests of Persia than Bayat. It is rumoured that the Shah at Russian instigation has instructed the Prime Minister not to resign. 2. The account of the activities of the German organised Fifth Column in Persia published in the local British paper, the Daily News (see Summary No. 11/45, paragraph 6), has aroused a storm of criticism in the Persian press, which angrily demands proof of the association of any important Persians with German agents, denies the existence of any plot, maintains the innocence of the majority of the Persians arrested and attributes the publicity given at this juncture to alleged activities some two years old to a malevolent British design to prejudice Persia’s standing at the San Francisco Conference and later at the Peace Conference. 3. The following have been definitely selected to represent Persia at the San Francisco Conference :— Nasrullah Intezam : Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mustafa Adi: Minister of Justice. Dr. Siassi : Minister without Portfolio. Hassan Taqizadeh : Ambassador to London. Majid Ahi : Ambassador in Moscow. It is understood that it is doubtful whether Taqizadeh will consent to go. The delegation will be joined in Washington by the Persian Ambassador in Washington, Muhammad Shayesteh, and the Persian Trade Representative in the United States, Dr. Nasr. KA. 3 /; ?. Economic. 4. In more responsible Persian circles anxiety is being created by the chaos that is commonly said to have followed on the departure of Dr. Millspaugh and the withdrawal of American control in the whole financial and economic adminis tration of the Government. The Treasury is nearly empty; revenue is not coming- in; salaries are in arrears; corruption is again rampant in the distribution of rationed monopoly goods; and no plans have yet been made for the collection of the coming harvest or to ensure a very necessary and justifiable (having regard to the bumper harvest expected) reduction in the price of bread. 5. A recent survey of motor transport, owned privately or by the Govern ment, available for civilian purposes in Persia, has resulted in the following figures :— Trucks of approximately 2\ tons capacity 3,757 Above 2^ tons ,, 1,941 Total 5,698 These figures include approximately 681 buses but no touring cars. They are considered to be accurate within 10 per cent. 6. A Bill has been tabled by the Government to sanction the imposition of a 3 per cent, increase on the price at which the Governmeut retails fnonopoly [ 6^ 10] V ' ' 1goods, the proceeds to be credited to provincial municipalities. Municipalities are now in most cases bankrupt and in debt. Medical. 7. Some half a dozen mobile dispensaries have been equipped by the Persian Government and are now touring the provinces. It is intended to increase the number when funds are available This measure was probably inspired by the success of the mobile dispensary provided by Paiforce which for the past two years has been touring extensively among the Kurdish, Lur, Bakhtiari, Qashgai, Khamseh and Arab tribes. A ppointments — Civil. 8. —^(i) Rukneddin Ashtiani to be First Secretary to the Persian Legation in Switzerland; (ii) Bihjat Nuri to be Secretary to the Persian Consulate-General in Jerusalem; (iii) Muzafferi to be Farmandar. of the newly-created Shahrestan of Sirjan (Kerman Province). ^4 rm y^ Persian Forces. 9. General Ridley states that the United States Government some time ago informed the Persian Government that his mission would be withdrawn on 1st March, when the period of their contracts expired, and that the Persian Government then requested that the mission should remain for some time longer. The United States Government have cancelled their orders for the recall of the mission but nothing has been settled as to the period for which they will remain. Owing to lack of funds to make the necessary bulk purchases the supply admin istration organised by the American Mission is functioning irregularly and with difficulty, and, due to inefficiency and to labour troubles in the textile mills, it seems likely that the cloth required for summer uniforms will not be available in time. Air Force. • 10. It is learnt from secret sources that Colonel Khosrevani, of the Persian Air Force, who was sent to America in October to attend the International Air Conference (see Summary No. 40/44, paragraph 4), has requested the Westing- house Electrical International Company of New York to make a project for the equipment of the Qaleh Murgheh airfield at Tehran with all devices necessary for air services, and subsequently to make a survey of the whole of Persia with a view to assessing requirements for radio communications and radio navigation for internal air services. Kurdistan. * Internal Security. 11. As reported in Summary No. 9/45. paragraph 10, and Summary No. 8/45, paragraph 10, the Persian Government, after the disturbance at Mahabad, ordered the despatch to that town of a column from the Saqqiz Brigade. On reaching Bukan the column was met by the Farmandar of Mahabad and Qazi Muhammad, the most prominent Kurdish notability of the town, who informed the commander that the Kurds could not be restrained from opposing the occupa tion of the town by the Persian troops. When the Persian commander decided to ignore this warning a Russian officer intervened and forbade the further advance of the column. This order was obeyed. Negotiations are now in pro gress with the Russians through diplomatic channels. It is understood that the Russians are insisting that any troops required for the garrisoning of Mahabad must be taken from those already in Azarbaijan. Pars. 12. There has been a further case of shooting at travellers on the Shiraz- Bushire road resulting in one death and two persons wounded. But security generally remains good. Russian Affairs. 13. The Dost-i-lran, the Persian paper published by the Publicity’Depart ment of the Soviet Embassy, has printed an article, alleged to be based on American sources, which is offensively critical of British policy in Greece. It will not tend to convince the public of the reality of Anglo-Russian unity. Tehran, ^th March, 1945.Military Attache s Intelligence Summary No. 13, Secret, for the period '2§th March to ls£ April, 1945.— {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 102 of Ath April; Received 17th April.) Persian Affairs ' ^ Political. . Ihere has been no meeting of the Majlis since the Nauruz holidays, so v r e -r me Mm ister remains in office. The election of a new President of the Majlis and office-bearers is shortly due, and the Prime Minister hopes that the disagreements that are likely to arise over those elections may disrupt the unity of the Majlis groups now combined in opposition to him. Moreover, there is as yet no agreement among a majority of the Deputies as to his successor. Pakravan and Bader are the most talked-of candidates. 2. For some time past Seyyid Zia has absented himself from sessions of the Majlis. He has been occupied with the organisation of this party under the name of Iradeh-i-Milli (the National Will). The party has published an admn able piogiamme of reform and has gained some adherents in Tehran, who do not, however, include any persons of present or likely future political importance. Because of its opposition to the Tudeh party it is supported nnancially by some merchants and millowners. Little progress, if any. has as vet been made with the organisation of branches in the provinces. 3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nasrullah Intezam, has resigned. This may be due in part to the opposition that has been expressed to his being appointed to lead the Persian delegation to the San Francisco Conference. Taqizadeh’s refusal to go is said to be due to his objection to being second fiddle to Intezam. 1 he composition of the delegation may now be changed. 4. Active opposition to the Tudeh party is increasing. In Isfahan the Deputies Saifpur Fatimi and Doulatabadi, aided by the impolitic actions of an d the firm action of the Governor-General against ludeh disturbers of the peace, have for the time being welded the elements opposed to the Tudeh party into some unity, with the result that the Tudeh party has lost ground. On the 27th March the offices of the party were wrecked by members of the anti-Tudeh Union after an exchange of stone-throwino- which took place during a demonstration organised by the latter. In Azarbaijan in the districts of Ardebil and Maragheh, agents of the Tudeh party have been meeting with rough treatment. In Shiraz, too, active opposition is beincr organised. The Tudeh press has been fulminating with hysterical anger ao-ains't the fascists, reactionaries and agents of imperialism whom it blames foAhesP manifestations of dislike of the Russian fifth column. 5. The killing of five Persians, apparently intending to steal Allied telegraph wire, by Indian troops protecting the Ime has been very strongly and unfavourably criticised—-it may be assumed, not without Russian approval—bv the Tudeh party paper Rahbar. After asserting the illegality of the action of the Indian troops, the article goes on to express sympathy with the “poor dirty, illiterate ” Indians, who were not the persons really to blame. 1 A ppointments — Military. 6 The following Sarhangs have been promoted to Sartip (i) Hussein Atapur, C.B.E. : Inspectorate Department (ii) Nasrullah Bayendor : head of Army Engineer Department ni) Muhammad Mazheri : Director of 4th Bureau, General Staff (* v ^'‘.UkrUr^k 1111 : G 0 C - 3rd (Azerbaijan) Division ( v ) , Mehdi Qub Alavi Muqaddam : Army Veterinary Services (vi) Seifullah Parsa : head of No. 1 Military HoSpttal Tehran [65—6J . ‘ I 23 JUN / INDIA u2 Internal Security.

In spite of the assurance of the Soviet Embassy that a reduced Persian column from the garrison at Saqqiz, reinforced by a battalion from Tabriz which might be relieved at Tabriz by a battalion from Tehran, would be allowed to move to Mahabad, the local Russian military authorities still refuse to permit the column to advance. See Summary No. 12/45, paragraph 11. Kuhigalu. 8. Abdullah Zarghampur has made his submission to the Government and it has been accepted. He has been given some assurance that his sins of the past would be overlooked if he behaved well in future, but not a formal pardon. He has undertaken not to interfere in the affairs of the other chiefs of Kuhigalu or of other tribes. The chiefs previously in opposition to him are to be assured that they are not being abandoned by Government and that they can count on the support of Government against any attempt by Abdullah Khan to interfere with their rights or to impose himself as overlord of Kuhigalu. The question is whether the Boir Ahmadi, having agreed now not to loot each other, will be able to refrain from looting their neighbours. Russian Affairs. 9. It is reported that the Soviet military authorities are taking up land near Rezaieh, l abriz and Mianeh, ostensibly for the purpose of growing their own vegetables, and that villages are being rented in the vicinity of Tehran apparently by members of the Tudeh party but really by the Russians. To the Persians this can mean only an attempt to get hold of the peasants who in these villages will be given cause to appreciate Soviet methods. Both reports require confirmation. 10. On the 23rd March Soviet troops in Meshed turned out in considerable numbers to prevent interference by the Persian police with crowds which were being harangued by Tudeh orators. H It reported, but requires confirmation, that the Russians are making a new airfield at Khoi in north-west Azerbaijan. 12. The new Archimandrite of the Armenian Church in Julfa (Isfahan) is reported to be telling Armenians that the time has come for them to return to their native land and that arrangements for this are being made by the Soviet Government. 13. A Society of Armenian-Soviet Cultural Relations has been formed in Isfahan. A merican A ffairs. ^ me G can military survey party is now making preliminary arrange ments lor the making of an aeronautical chart which is to cover Persia south of a line somewhere between the 28th and 29th parallels of latitude and west of the Shiraz-Isfahan-Tehran road. It seems that the country affected is to be covered fairly thoroughly by survey parties, since points are to be fixed by ground survey every 50 miles. ' &amp; Czechoslovak Affairs. 15. M.

Owing to the continued absence on holiday of many Deputies there was no public session of the Majlis until the 3rd April, when it proceeded to elect a new president. The running was close between Seyyid Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai (the out-going president) and Mehdi Farrukh (F.O. 61; M.A. 85). No less than three separate ballots were taken at that session as there was some doubt as to whether some of the papers marked “ Tabatabai ' referred to the outgoing president or to Seyyid Muhammad Tabatabai, also a candidate for the presidency. Objections were also raised on the score that some of Seyyid Muhammad badiq’s papers had been brought into the Majlis from outside. It was finally announced that Seyyid Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai had been elected by 49 votes to 48 cast for Mehdi Farrukh. On the 5 th April Dr. Malek Madani( 1 ) was elected as first vice-president, receiving 74 votes out of 94. Dr. Moazemi( 1 ) was then elected second vice-president with 71 votes out of 101. Some minor members of the Majlis presidential body, such as recorders, tellers, &amp;c., were elected at the next session. 2 . It is reported, but not confirmed, that at the next public session Bayat intends to ask for a vote of confidence after describing what his Government has achieved since it came into office. This recital should not take long. 3. Taqizadeh, Ahi, Ala and Mustashar-ud-Dowleh are all reported to have refused to head the Persian delegation to the San Francisco conference. The first two have pleaded ill health. M. Ala makes no secret of his dread of the perils of a sea or air voyage, and Mustashar-ul-Dowleh is said to have alleged advancing age as his excuse.

The Cabinet has approved the statutes of the Supreme Economic Council. They are published as Appendix “ A ” to this summary. 2 . The Cabinet has drawn up regulations governing the sale of ‘ £ foreign goods with special reference to the sale of surplus stores by the Allies and the collection of customs dues thereon. They are published as Appendix “ B to this summary. 3 The Minister of Finance has tabled a Bill in the Majlis to govern the sale of public domains and ceded properties. The text has not yet been published. 4 . The four secretaries of the Majlis have been elected. They are Sadiqi, Hashimi, Jawad Masudi and Tusi. Thus there has been no change in either the presidential body or the secretaries of the Majlis. The various Majlis Commissions for Finance, Interior, Education, Agriculture, Industry and Mines, Foreign Affairs, Communications, Health, Military Affairs and Posts and Telegraphs were also elected. 5 . As considerable time may elapse before the budget for 1324 (March 1945-March 1946) is passed, the Majlis has prepared a ££ two-twelfths ” Bill to cover the period the 21st March-20th May. 6 . Almost every day new names have been announced in the press for the Persian Government’s selection of representatives for the San Francisco Conference. Whether Taqizadeh and Ahi have maintained their refusal to go is not yet confirmed. The latest list of starters from Persia comprises the following :— Nasrullah Intezam, Mustafa- Adi (Mansur-us-Saltaneh), Dr. Siyasi, Salih, Dr. Qasim Ghani, Seyyid Baqir Kazemi; Dr. Qasim Zadeh (legal adviser to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) and Fazlullah Nabil (head of the 3 rd Political Department in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) will also accompany the delegation. Sartip Ali Eiazi and Colonel Muarrafi have gone as military representatives. The Majlis representatives are Dr. Abduh, Dr. Shafaq and Dr. Itebar. Dr. Ali Akbar Daftari (legal adviser), Ahmad Ardeshir (counsellor and interpreter), Dr. Suratgar (counsellor and interpreter), Muazzami and Gaudarzi (secretaries) are also said to have been selected. 7. Muhammad Hussein Jehanbani has resigned from the directorship of the Road Transport Department. With his previous .record (in the Ministry of Interior and, for a brief spell, as Chief of Police) of garrulous ineptitude and bribe taking on a scale sufficient to make even a Persian gasp, he will be no loss to that body.

The Chief of the General Staff told the British Military Attache that 380 Persian military trucks out of a total of 700 were off the road awaiting repair or totally unserviceable. Many of these trucks have only been in use for less than a year and have run negligible mileages. Sartip Atapur’s report discloses hopeless chaos and widespread peculation. While the repair services are [65—7] u A -M . P3L.

It remains to be seen whether he interferes in local affairs with the same precipitancy and stupidity as the egregious Marchenko. Tudeh and anti-Tudeh activity has, for the moment, died down. The new Armenian Archimandrite at Julfa is reported as having told his flock that they should consider the wisdom of migrating from Persia and returning to their coreligionists in Soviet Armenia.

It has been told to stand fast there in the hopes that the Russians will subsequently permit its entry into Mahabad, and that the Kurds will realise what is coming to them when the Russians depart. Meanwhile negotiations between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Soviet Embassy are at a standstill. The Russians still insist that any garrison required for Mahabad should come from Tabriz; be limited to one battalion of infantry and should not be replaced in Tabriz. British Interests. 14.

K E . Political. ^ v&gt; 1 . Bayat’s Cabinet has fallen. The dismissal of Millspaugh gained him a respite by pandering to the capitalists and crooks who stood to lose by economic and financial stability. Some flirtations with the Tudeh earned him another breathing space by placating the Left. The Xau Ruz holidays, the election of the Majlis President, Presidential body and sub-committees, and a sitting suspended out of respect to the late President of the United States served to postpone the day of reckoning a little longer. A notice of interpellation of the Government by Seyyid Zia-ud-din Tabatabai was only withdrawn on the understanding that on the 17th April Bayat would address the Majlis on the subject of his Government’s achievements and would ask for a vote of confidence. In the course of a very long speech, which received a very mixed reception and during which he was interrupted several times by shouts from the public gallery, the Prime Minister gave an account of the Government’s position and its activities during its tenure of office. This, he said, had been forced upon him by the spreading of false rumours about the Government by certain people, rumours which had found their way into the press. Instead of taxing the Government m open debate in the Majlis those persons had spread unfavourable propaganda which had only resulted in a weakening of the Central Government’s position. He had been ready to answer his critics for some time past, but a necessary delay had been imposed by the Nau Ruz holidays and the election of Majlis officials. He spoke of the conditions under which his Government came into power and of the difficulties which had arisen, especially over plans for internal reorganisation. The speed with which the Millspaugh problem was settled came in for special mention, and he stressed the fact that Millspaugh’s departure had done nothing to impair relations between Persia and the United States. Persia’s relations with the United States, one of her great Allies, were to-day, as always, based on established principles and there had been no change in their friendship and mutual under standing. In spite of rumours published by certain sections of the press, rumours which were spread in the hope of creating disunity between Persia and the Great Powers, the firm and full understanding with those Powers had not only been safeguarded but confirmed and strengthened. He repeated statements made in previous sessions of the Majlis about the rumoured arming of the tribes and the formation of a Tribal Union, and denied that there was any truth in the rumour that the Americans leaving Persia were destroying all the installations they had built or that they were dismantling such installations and shipping them out; no installation had ever been destroyed or removed, and negotiations for the transfer of such material had already been opened. He was happy to say that Persia’s foreign policy was clear and that a perfect understanding with her Allies was enjoyed; any statement to the contrary could only be attributed to those ill-intentioned persons who wished to stir up troubled waters. It was the duty of all legislative powers in Persia and of the Government to work in the closest collaboration to ensure Persia’s future in a manner worthy of her ancient civilisation and historical prestige, and conforming to the part played by Persia in the Allies' victory and the sacrifices she had borne. Bayat concluded his speech by requesting the House to judge between his Government and their opponents. A proposal made by Deputy Dashti that the vote of confidence in the Government should be taken was approved. Of the ninety-two members present only forty-five cast their votes in favour of Bayat, with three against and forty-three abstentions. The Prime Minister thanked the House and wished them success in the choice of a better Government. His Imperial Majesty the Shah has sent a message to the Majlis urging them t: lose no time in choosing a successor and putting an end [65—37] r W9m m., Ihi PT 23 JUN 1 ( M' INDIA2 2.

Malmud Bader (F.O. 40-M.A.. 51) and Fathullah Pakravan (F.O. 169-M.A. 208) have been mentioned as possible successors to Bayat. there are some grounds for belief, however, that the various Majlis factions have not been able to come to an agreement over the choice of one of these and may choose a nonentity incapable, either by past reputation or future activity, of incurring the displeasure of anyone. 3. The following names were announced in connexion with the Supreme Economic Council (see paragraph 1 of Intelligence Summary No. 15/45) : The Prime Minister—honorary President; Dr. Moazzami—President; Imami— vice-President; Nasir Quli Ardelan—Secretary. 4.

A battalion of approximately 300 strong has been moved from Ahwaz to Khorramshahr. They will take over the guarding of the port installations and stores at Fahliyeh creek. This has been done at the request of His Majesty’s Embassy, whose desire it is to see the Persian Government and Persian Army’s authority re-established in areas where the British forces have been in occupation and also to bring home to the Persian Government a sense of their joint responsi bilities, as Allies, for the safeguarding of our commuications in Persia. 9. The Chief of the General Staff, General Arfa, is uneasy about the situation which will arise in the North when the Soviet troops are' withdrawn. (He added parenthetically and gloomily, “ if ever they do withdraw.”) He envisages their stealing silently away overnight and then returning to “ restore the situation,” i.e., to suppress the disorders which will have broken out at their instigation. To forestall this he is busy assembling and training a brigade to occupy Gurgan (where the Yamut Turcomans have come heavily under the influence of the Soviets) and a mechanised brigade which, plus the column ordered to stand fast near Bukan, will be required to occupv Azerbaijan.

According to a press report, the Soviet military authorities have asked the Persian Government to appoint representatives to take over the port instal lations at Nau Shahr, which, owing to the decrease in Aid to Russia supplies, are no longer required by the Soviet military authorities. The terms of the transfer are not mentioned but, in any case, during the time of their occupation the Soviet military authorities have not made any considerable alterations or improvements to the port or its installations. The Russian papers Trud and Red Fleet have published articles on Persia recently, based on information supplied by Tass Agency. The articles have violently attacked Seyyid Zia and accuse him of bringing about the fall of Bayat. The articles also warn Persia against “ reactionary ” tendencies. Appendix.

The above figures are in respect of the forward (south to north) carrying only, i.e., “ Aid to Russia” goods, and do not include stores transported by the various transport agencies for the maintenance of their “ Aid to Russia” services or Persian Government supplies or petrol oil lubricants carried in East Persia. 2. The figures shown under Soviet Transportation represent the cargoes loaded and transported on the newly-assembled trucks, the driving and convoying of which were undertaken by the Soviet Transportation directorate. Where loads were carried on trucks assembled at the U.K.C.C. plant at Bushire and driven by U.K.C.C. drivers the tonnage has been included under U.K.C.C. 3. The low percentage, i.e., 3 per cent., of the G.P.T. Companies is due, amongst other things, to the fact that they operated for fifteen months only, as against American army, twenty months; U.K.C.C., thirty-four months; and Soviet Transportation, twenty-four months.

M.e-.vo Political. ' i- THE Deputies, having been unable to agree on any man of character, have elected a nonentity as Prime Minister in the person of Ibrahim Hakimi (Hakim ul Mulk), an old deaf man who has played no important part in Persian politics for many years. In past history he was physician to Muzaffer ed Din Shah and was subsequently a Cabinet Minister in several Governments before Reza Shah’s reign. He is said to be honest and is known to be ineffective. He obtained sixty-four votes from the Deputies, Sadiq Sadiqi (Mustashar ed Douleh) (F.O. 193; M.A. 248), who was preferred by the Russians, finding twenty-four supporters. Rumours that Hakimi intends in the choice of the members of his Cabinet to give paramount consideration to the propitiation of the Soviet Embassy have already raised doubts in the minds of those who voted for him whether their choice was wise, and hopes of his having a stable maiority are not high. 2. On the advice of His Majesty’s Ambassador the Persian authorities decided to suspend for the 1 st May the order forbidding public gatherings and demonstrations in Tehran since the professed object of the Tudeh party was to show their admiration for the Red army. The party was consequently allowed to hold a May Day procession on condition that orders given by the Military Governor to party leaders regarding the route to be followed and the avoidance of offensive slogans were obeyed. A crowd of 4,000-6,000 men and women was collected for the occasion, mostly Armenians, Assyrians, refugees of some years ago from Russia and Turks from Azerbaijan. The proceedings were entirely orderly. Economic. 3. The personnel of the commissions which according to the Statutes of the Supreme Economic Council—see appendix to Summary No. 15/1945—are to be charged with responsibility for studying and reporting to the Supreme Council on questions connected with finance, agriculture, labour and commerce have now been appointed. The presidents of the commissions in the above order are Mahmud Bader (F.O. 40; M.A. 51); Ahmad Hussein Adi; Dr. Aghayan and Mohammad Mehdi Nimazi.

(ii) Sarhang Seyyid Hussein Hashimi Ha’iri to command the Independent Mechanised Brigade (Tehran). (iii) Sarhang Keihan to be head of the Army Transport Department vice Sartip Atapur, resigned. Internal Security. Western A zerbaijan. 5. Disturbing reports are reaching the Persian authorities regarding the situation in Mahabad. It has already been reported in Summaries No. 12/1945, paragraph 11 , and No. 14/1945, paragraph 15, that a column of Persian troops, which the Government had despatched with a view to establishing their authority in Mahabad, had been stopped by the Soviet military authorities. R-ecent reports [ 66 — 6 ]' ‘ JVJl 1 mo'A O' &gt;Ff\CS2 *say that there is intensified propaganda for Kurdish independence; that the | 4 local Kurdish leader, Qazi Muhammad, is enlisting Kurds for the Independent Kurdish army; that funds are being collected; that a pageant had been staged showing Kurdistan delivered from bondage by the Russians; and that a named Samadoff had recently arrived from the Caucasus to encourage the i movement. These reports are possibly exaggerated, but there is little doubt that j there is some truth in them—unfortunately, because they serve to embitter the j attitude of the Persian authorities towards the Kurds in general. According to a circumstantial report received by the Persian Government, the Soviet Consul from Rezaieh recently visited Mahabad and promised full Russian support to the movement for Kurdish independence. The truth of this requires confirmation. Some reports say that the movement is spreading to the Herki, the Shakkah, the Mansur, the Dehbukri and the Mamish, and that the onk chief of Northern Kurdistan on whose loyalty the Persian Government can rely is Quraini Agha I 0 f the Mamish. The tribes of Southern Kurdistan have as yet shown no sign of being seriously affected. Eastern Azerbaijan. 6 . A few days ago the Soviet Ambassador informed the Persian Under secretary for Foreign Affairs that, unless the Persian authorities began within five days the disarmament of the Shahsavan tribes of the Ardebil district and of the “ brigands ” of Mianeh, the Soviet military authorities would undertake the operation themselves. The Shahsavan tribes are anti-Russian, and their principal chief in the Ardebil area, Sardar Xusrat, has recently been taking' vigorous action against agents of the Tudeh party who have ventured into the tribal territory. ' Bv the “brigands” of the Mianeh district the Soviet Ambassador means the followers of Salar Muzaffer, a prominent landowner who has also recently been hunting Tudeh agents from his district. The reply given to the ambassador is said to have been that the Persian troops would be instructed to begin disarmament operations in the towns of Mianeh and Ardebil (where, according to the Chief of the General Staff, Tudeh sympathisers have been issued with arms by the Russians), and that further operations would be carried out in accordance with the Government’s general programme in which the disarmament of the Kurds of Mahabad had priority. Kuhigcdu. 7. Abdullah Khan Zarghampur appears to have made good use of the re-establishment of correct relations with the Persian authorities that followed on his submisison, reported in Summary No. 13, paragraph 8 , to convert the responsible Persian Army commander, General Humayuni, to a belief in his (Abdullah’s) virtues and in the unreliability of all the Kuhigalu chiefs lately opposed to him—flussein Quli Rustami, Khosrow Zarghampur, Muhammad Hussein Taheri and Malik Mansur Bashti, who were, until the submission of Abdullah, strongly supported by General Humayuni. The latter is now accusing them of preparing to create trouble at the instigation of agents of the Tudeh party, who have, it is true, recently visited Behbehan and Hussein Quli Rustami of the Mamassani. He has suggested that Abdullah Khan should be used to arrest Khosrow and disarm his followers The Chief of the General Staff has expressed to General Humayuni his surprise at this sudden change of attitude and has asked for more precise information to justify it. It is unlikely that this will be forthcoming. Russian Affairs. 8 . About a dozen persons of the landowning class of Mianeh in Azerbaijan were recently deported to Tabriz by the Soviet military authorities, their crime apparently being opposition to the Tudeh party. Some have since been allowed to return to Mianeh. 9. The incidents at Tabriz of which the Soviet Ambassador, as reported m Summary No. 16 /1945, paragraph 5, had complained—with good cause—turned out to be an assault by Persian policemen on a Russian in civilian clothes, who, however, was not killed, and a much more serious incident where it is alleged an assault was made by seven Persian civilians on two Russian youths and a Russian o-irl of 15 was raped. The suspected assailants in the latter case were arrested by the Persian authorities, but the Russians insisted on their being handed over to them and they are still in Russian custody.3 • 10. In the course of an obviously inspired article in one of the Persian papers subsidised by the Russians commenting on a suggestion made in an article in the Washington Post to the eftect that Russia did not really need Persian oil the statement is made that Russia certainly requires more oil since she wishes to conserve her own oil supplies for the needs of national defence and ‘ ‘ military economy,” for the supply of the European market, particularly in the Balkans w '^^and possibly of the French and Italian fleets. Her home consumption was increasing; Russia was relying in increasing degree on mechanised agriculture. The oil of North Persia would be transported via the Volga to Central Russia for internal consumption. Chinese Affairs. 11 . The Chinese Minister, Mr. Li Tieh-tseng, has returned to Persia after an absence of two months and will shortly present new letters of credence on his elevation to the rank of ambassador.►file copy THIS DOCUM^l^j^THE PROPERTY OF HIS llRITANNIC?

Foreign Affairs : Anushirwan Sepahbudi (F.O. 205—M.A. 282). War : Ibrahim Zand. Health : Dr. Ismail Marzban (Amin-ul-Mulk) (F.O. 128). Agriculture : Nasrullah Khalatbari (Ittela-ul-Mulk). Finance : Abdul Hussein Hajir (F.O. 79—M.A.104). Roads and Communications : Nadir Arasteh. Commerce and Industry : Abul-Qasim Najm (F.O. 156—M.A. 192). Education : Ghulam Hussein Rahnema. Ministers without portfolio :— Hassan Ali Kamal Hidayet (Nasr-ul-Mulk) (F.O. 107—M.A. 140). Mustafa Adi (Mansur-us-Sultaneh) (F.O. 1—M.A. 1 ). Justice : Dr. Khushbin (Acting). Posts and Telegraphs : Not yet appointed. The selection appears to have been mainly on a desire to appoint Ministers with no political bias or convictions. It is, consequently, not remarkable that with a few exceptions they are colourless. Hajir is able, but will be obstructed by the Russians and the Tudeh. Sepahbudi was recently ambassador in Turkey. Khalatbari has for years suffered from senile decay and has been long in retirement. Najm, who is now ambassador at Kabul, is expected to refuse his appointment. Rahnema is a new-comer to political life. He is a professor of mathematics and vice-chancellor of the university. The Minister for Justice is likely to be offered to Allahyar Saleh (F.O. 198—M.A. 253), who is now at the San Francisco Conference. 2. The Cabinet has already come in for much criticism, and prophecies about the length of its life are gloomy. It meets with the approval of no group in the Majlis, and it is unlikely that it will command a sufficiently stable majority to enable it to undertake any effective measures of government. The parliamentary groups that combined against Bayat and later to elect Hakimi have fallen apart again, and dissensions have appeared even within individual groups. There is some talk of forming a group in the Majlis to be openly associated with and called by the name of the party that Seyyid Zia has recently formed outside the Majlis—the Iradeh-i-Milli. The small Tudeh group still remains unique in having some party discipline and in following a consistent programme, and in opposition to alleged sympathisers with Seyyid Zia or with the British it can, in certain circumstances, count on the support of an increasing number of Deputies who for reasons of private mteiests find it advisable to court Russian favour. 3 Persia celebrated the victory of herself and her Allies over Germany with restrained elation. A salute of 101 guns was fired; Government buildings were ordered to display the flags of the Emted Nations, bands played maitial music in the public squares; but on the whole the population of Tehran was apathetic In the Shah’s broadcast to the Persian people, in the speeches made in the Majlis by the Prime Minister and the Speaker the great part plaved by Persia in the victory was given due prominence. When the hour was darkest for the Allies Persia, it was claimed, threw her weight on their side by declaiing war on the Axis. Even before that she had, at great sacrifices to the Persian npoole d laced her roads, railways and communications at their disposal. How LpFt.lv then'should she be rewarded by her grateful Allies. The Shah^ has already called attention to the great services rendered by the Railways by conferring on the Railway Administration the Order o* [66—42] top /\y\ Q9 JUN1945 IMD1A office2 Economic. 4. The policy for the collection of this year’s harvest has now been approved by the Economic Council. Substantial reductions are to be made in the price at which grain will be purchased by the Government; the number of buying centres is to be greatly reduced; and Government will not buy grain in deficit areas (of which the Tehran district is the most important). Purchases of barley will be limited to those made by the Ministry of War and the^~ gendarmerie for forage. All indications are that, provided serious damage by, j locusts can be prevented, the harvest should produce a considerable surplus over the requirements for internal consumption. 5 . Locusts have appeared along the Persian Gulf littoral, notably at Bushire and Bandar Abbas, and at Birjand, Kerman and in the Farrashband and Ear districts of Ears. In the north they have appeared at Gurgan and on the Moghan steppe. In all these areas control measures of varying degrees of efficiency are being taken, in the south with the assistance of British, and in the north of Russian experts. 6 . There is now’ a weekly air service, once each way, between Tehran and Bushire calling at Isfahan and Shiraz, operated by de Havilland Rapide or Dominie machines, the property of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. A 'p'pointments — military. 7. (i) Sarhang Sarimi to command the 11 th (Saqqiz) Brigade; (ii) Sarhang Kama! to be Officer Commanding Gendarmerie in Kermanshah. Internal Security. Kuhigcdu. * 8 . It is reported that the rival Boir Ahmadi chiefs, Abdullah Zarghampur and his half-brother Khrosrow, have signed an agreement which may for a time eliminate one of the possible causes of trouble in that turbulent area. Russian Interests. 9. The Tudeh press has been voicing Russian displeasure with the Persian delegates at San Francisco who dared to vote in opposition to Russia in favour of the Argentine being invited to the conference. They, it says, are obviously merely tools in the hands of certain Great Powers. The campaign against Seyyid Zia and his “masters” continues without pause. Shameless attempts are being made to intimidate by threats the Court of Justice which is to try an action for defamation brought by Seyyid Zia against one of the Tudeh papers 10. The May Day celebrations of the Tudeh party in Meshed went on for two days. Mounted Russian officers and about sixty soldiers with tommy-guns were on duty in the streets for the protection of party members. 11. Recent manoeuvres by British troops in the area Behbehan -Gacn Saran during which a number of the chiefs of Kuh-i-Galu and Mamassani weie entertained by General Lochner, have, as was to be expected aroused the suspicious curiosity of the Russians. The Russian vice-consul and two membeis of the Ahwaz Consulate recently visited Behbehan and Gach, Saran where, | since Persians will usually tell the kind of tale that they think will be welcome to their visitor, they have doubtless collected much information to confirm their suspicions of British encouragement of tribal chiefs in their desire to return to an autonomous and feudal tribal system and of British support for le establishment of unity among the tribes of the south, to be used one day against the Tudeh party and Russian interests, and perhaps even the distribution of arms to the tribes. French Interests. 12 M. Herriot has arrived in Tehran from Moscow and imprisonment in Germany, the Persians were at some pains to do him honour and to express I to him their attachment to France in terms of fulsome flattery. M. Herriot s v replies were highly pleasing to Persian vanity. Turkish Interests. 13. A Turkish commercial mission has arrived in Tehran to investigate the prospects of trade between Persia and Turkey and more particularly the purchase of Persian tobacco. Vatican Interests. 14 Mgr.

Political. 1 . More than a fortnight has passed since the Cabinet was presented to the Majlis and it is not yet known whether it will stay or fall. On the 14th May the Prime Minister announced his programme—the consolidation of friendly relations with Persia’s allies, based on the Tripartite Treaty, the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of Tehran; revision of taxes; attention to economic problems and to agricultural reforms; reform of the security forces; improvement of conditions for workers and peasants. Since then the Deputies have resorted to various tricks to postpone the taking of a vote on the programme. The Tudeh party declared its opposition to the Government as a matter of principle, since it did not stand for that radical reorganisation of society which the party desired to see. All its representatives in the Majlis and some ten to twelve other members notified their intention to speak against the Government’s programme; and these speeches, alternating with those of supporters of the Government, have filled up the last ten days. In addition to the Tudeh representatives there are many Deputies who are not content with the Government. They are chiefly interested in having in the Ministries of War and Interior Ministers who can be induced to secure their re-election, and they do not see in the present Cabinet those with the necessary qualities. They are therefore attempting to reconcile their divergent views as to a suitable alternative to Hakimi as Prime Minister and to make up a coalition of groups that will form a majority in the Majlis. It seems that at best Hakimi can hope for only a small majority and it is doubtful whether in the circumstances he will be willing to continue in office. 2. There is a very prevalent demand that, now that the war with Germany is over and Persian communications are no longer required for the transport of munitions to Russia, Allied troops should evacuate Persian territory. In his speech introducing the Government’s programme the Prime Minister expressed the hope that the Allies would substitute more normal relations for those based on the Tripartite Treaty, and other speakers defined this more precisely as a hope that Allied troops would leave the country. The same hope is expressed over and over again in the press, combined very frequently with a demand for the release of the remaining internees. 3. One of the numerous political parties in Persia—the Ada]at, a party with a programme of reform by persuasion, opposed to the Tudeh because of its Russian connexion, staged a demonstration on the 18th May to celebrate the Allied victory and also to demand the evacuation of Persia by Allied troops and the release of the detenus. The meeting was broken up by an attack staged— there is little doubt—by the Tudeh party. One of the Adalat party was killed and several injured by bricks thrown by the attackers, with whom the police made no attempt to interfere. For their inactivity the Government is largely to blame since, at Russian insistence, they suspended the Chief of the Isfahan police for taking action against Tudeh rioters. Subsequently, some eight arrests were made. It is reported that the Soviet Ambassador made a strong verbal protest against the matter of the withdrawal of Allied troops being allowed to be made the subject of a popular demonstration. 4 . In the speeches of the Tudeh members in opposition to the Government attacks were made on the whole of the present social system, on the present direction of the army (although the Tudeh supports a strong national army, politically educated), on the servants of the imperialists and on the support by the reactionaries of the feudal tribal system. The usual acc^ifNIjg)® p£L [66—59] / 12JULig4 q f INDIA OFFIC E t VA/O A-M2 was made that the tribes were being supplied with arms in the interests of imperialism. Better relations and a new treaty with Russia were advocated. Seyyid Zia came in for much abuse, and on several successive days his supporters organised demonstrations in his favour at the entrance of the Majlis. 5. Seyyid Zia’s party—the Iradeh i Midi—is increasing in numbers, activity and, perhaps, prestige. It is preparing to open up branches in the towns of the South, wherever the Tudeh has branches. Attempts are being made to bring about a reconciliation between Seyyid Zia and the Shah, whose relations have been embittered by the incessant criticism of the Shah and the Court in the newspaper Rad i Imrwz, whose editor, Muzaft'ar Firuz, a Qajar prince very hostile to the Shah on account of the murder of his father, Prince Nusrat eel Douleh, by Reza Shah, was one of Seyyid Zia’s earliest and most ardent supporters. Seyyid Zia is now reported to have 4 broken with Muzaffar Firuz since he considers that the forces of resistance to Russian penetration should not be dissipated by attacks on the Crown. 6 . Dr. Musaddiq has again been in trouble with his fellow members of the Majlis. Not content with calling them a pack of thieves he accused them of doing nothing for the country and hinted that the country would be better without them. This provoked some reaction since it is known that Dr. Musaddiq is in close contact with the Shah and that the Shah would gladly be relieved of this troublesome Parliament. 7. A personality note on the Prime Minister, Hakimi, is attached as an appendix to this summary. Economic. 8 . The fall in prices that followed on the news of victory in Europe has not been maintained. Reports of world-shortages of commodities and of discord between Great Britain and Russia have caused prices to rise again. 9. Although the Persian financial year begins on the 22nd March the budget for the current year has not even been prepared, much less considered, by the Majlis. Consequently, all departments of the administration are living from hand to mouth with a complete absence of foresight, planning or provision. 10 . The present population of Persia according to the estimate of the Persian Government is 16,549,837, but according to estimates made by British consular officers for their various districts the total is 12,975,600. The latter- figure may be assumed to be nearer the correct number. A ppointments — Civil. 11 . —(i) Hurmuz Qarib to be First Secretary at the Persian Embassy in Turkey.

The leader of the anti-Fudeh Labour Union of Isfahan was murdered by thugs of the Tudeh party on the 25th May. This followed on the return from Tehran to Isfahan of the Tudeh leader, Bahrampur. He brought a large sum of money, and his intention piesumably was to endeavour to regain the ground recently lost by the Tudeh. He used the money to stir up Tudeh sympathisers and ruffians of the town. There had already been a fight between the Tudeh and their opponents on the 22 nd May. The town is now being patrolled bv Persian troops, and the Governor-General has recommended that a Military Governor should be appointed so that military law can be applied. The Chief of Police a relatively efficient man, had been recalled to Tehran some time previously at the insistence of the Russians, who objected to action he had taken against Tudeh agitators. The acting Chief of Police is believed to be in Russian pav.3 Fars. 14. Nasir Qashgai has sent to the Prime Minister and the Majlis an excited telegram protesting against the movement of Persian troops into Qashgai territory, apparently to garrison places that to some extent control the lines of migration. Nasir pretends to regard these moves as provocative, likely to alarm the tribes as to the intentions of Government and unjustified in view of the good ^^Bjprder maintained by the tribes during their upward migration. It is true I chat both the Qashgai and Khamseh tribes have moved from their winter to their summer quarters with unusually little disturbance to roads and villages. A minor incident has occurred between a section of the Qashgai tribe and the gendarmerie at Abadeh, which will not improve relations, when the gendarmerie attempted to force the Qashgai to drive to Shiraz sheep which they were taking for sale to Yazd. In .the ensuing fracas the gendarmerie opened fire and killed some sheep. Kurdistan. 15. It is reported from Kermanshah that early in April several important Kurdish chieftains from Iraq met representatives from the Persian Kurdish tribes of Kalkhani, Waladbegi and Qubadi to discuss plans for Kurdish independence. This meeting was followed by an anonymous petition to His Majesty’s Consul complaining of the oppression of the Iraqi and Kurdish Governments, and urging the establishment of an independent Kurdistan to include the Kurds of Syria, Iraq, Persia and Turkey. Russian Interests. 16. In commenting on rumours to the effect that present disagreements between Russia and Great Britain might lead to another war, one of the Russian- inspired Persian papers says that these rumours are being put about by persons interested in maintaining and increasing high prices. There was no possibility of Great Britain fighting Russia. In one stroke the Red army could sever the vital arteries leading from Great Britain’s oil supplies in Persia and Iraq. 17. A Society for the Promotion of Cultural Relations between the Armenians of Julfa (Isfahan) and Soviet Armenia has been organised in Julfa. An extract from a message to Stalin from the people of Soviet Armenia published in the Russian press of the 17th May is not without interest in this connexion. It reads, “ This is why our blood brothers abroad, whose lot continues to be bitter and heavy, look with so much admiration on our great advancements, meet with such love from Soviet Azarbaijan and accept with such gratitude the many-sided help afforded them by the Soviet Union.” The new Archimandrite of the Julfa see has returned to Armenia for a short visit. His Majesty’s Consul reports that although outwardly he abstains from expressing political views, in secret he encourages the Tudeh party. 18. An eminent Moslem priest from Soviet Russia, styled by the Persian press the Sheikh ul Islam of the Caucasus, has arrived in Tabriz and is to visit Qum and Meshed. The object of his visit may be to convince the Persian priest hood that Soviet principles are not injurious to Islam. 19. India has been given some attention lately not only in Russian papers such as The War and the Working Ctass, but also on similar lines in the Russian- inspired Persian press. The theme generally is : How can it be said that victory has brought freedom while the people of India and Africa are captive- and enslaved ?

Received in Foreign Office, \3th June.) d l 'fu U&gt;o. Persian Affairs. / Ha£(- Political. - f SPEECHES in the Majlis during the week have been concerned very little . * with the programme or qualities of the Government but almost entirely with propaganda for and against the Tudeh party. The speakers against the Govern ment, and indeed some of those nominally for the Government, were the ludeh members and their sympathisers, and they made good use of their opportunity to attack the many prevailing abuses, the present ruling classes and their alleged one-sided policy in foreign affairs. Some spirited rejoinders were made by their opponents. The debate, however, did not materially affect the views t c Deputies about the Government. The opposition of the Tudeh party and of those who from consideration of their personal interests feel bound to vote in accordance with the party dictates was certain. The fate of the Government depended on whether a sufficient number of the other Deputies would agree that a different Government would give them a better chance of re-election. That, it seems, was their conclusion, for when the vote was taken on the 3rd June only a small number supported the Government. It could not be contended that it was a good Government, but it fell not on its demerits but because the majority of the Deputies, who had themselves chosen Hakimi as Prime Minister, failed to induce him to appoint Ministers to their liking to the Cabinet posts that can exert great influence on the elections. Their obvious lack of concern for anything but their personal interests has further discredited the Majlis and strengthened the hands of those, notably the Shah and the Russians, who would like to see it dissolved. 2. The Persian Government has addressed notes to the British, Russian and American Embassies requesting the withdrawal of Allied troops from Persia, since with the end of the war in Europe the reasons for which those troops entered Persia no longer exist. The announcement that His Majesty’s Govern ment were giving sympathetic consideration to this request has given- pleasure and raised hopes. The question of withdrawal has figured large in the press and Majlis debates. Claims are made that even if the treaty does allow British troops to remain in Persia until six months after the end of the w T ar with Japan Russian troops have no justification for remaining, since Russia is not at war with Japan, and that Allied troops have no longer legal claim to the rights as regards censorship and the use and control of aerodromes, means of communica tion, &amp;c., which they have enjoyed by virtue of article 3 of the Tripartite Treaty, since that article refers only to the Allies’ undertaking to defend Persia against aggression and Persia is in no fear of aggression from Japan. 3. The Soviet Ambassador recently informed His Majesty’s Ambassador that the Soviet Government was opposed to the continued detention of the internees and he asked for the views of His Majesty’s Government. But unable to resist making political capital at the expense of His Majesty’s Government, Soviet officials did not delay to let it be known that the internees were now being detained solely to please the British. It had, in fact, already been decided that a number might be released, and that only those previously associated with the Japanese or known to be fundamentally hostile to the British need be detained. Economic. 4. The financial year March 1944-March 1945 ended up with a deficit in the Government’s finances of 462 million rials. Ordinary revenue was 3,924 million rials and commercial revenue 3.459 million rials. Ordinary expenditure totalled 3,844 million rials and commercial expenditure 4,001 million rials. The deficit for the previous year (1943-44) was 1,052 million TeCo. POL. [mi) HJUL1945 j I NDIA OFFICE ! [66—104]2 Army. 5.

Internal Security. r/t General. : &lt;? 6 . Remarkably few incidents of tribal lawlessness have been reported in recent weeks from the tribal areas of South and West Persia. This is probably due to a variety of causes : improved economic conditions, less provocation by Persian officials, in a few areas better security measures, and the conversion of some tribal leaders to the belief that at the present time good behaviour is the best policy for the tribes. Isfahan. 7. A large number of arrests—some reports say as much as a hundred—have been made in connexion with the murder of the anti-Tudeh Labour leader reported in Summary No. 20/45, paragraph 13. No further disturbances have occurred although the instigators of the murder are still at large. Western Azerbaijan. 8 . The situation at Mahabad is still very obscure. Even the Persian authorities have little information that is reliable. There is undoubtedly a movement for Kurdish independence, known as the J.K. Society, which according to Kurdish sources receives its inspiration from Iraq. There is little doubt, too, that the Russians are giving some encouragement to this movement. There is some competition for members, however, between the J.K. Society and the Tudeh party which the Russians may find it difficult to reconcile. The Kurds are generally hostile to the Tudeh whose principles are contrary to their religious ideas and to their tribal system. Russian Interests. 9. The Russian-inspired Persian press has, now that Russia is no-longer being supplied with petrol from Abadan, begun the expected campaign against the A.I.O.C. with the object of fostering discontent among Persian workers. The strike at Kermanshah, reported in paragraph 14, is its first success. The justice of the Persian claim to Bahrein and the iniquity of the continued detention of the internees are also being pressed in some of these papers. 10 . The Soviet Government recently invited a party of Persians to Baku to attend a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the “ independence ” of the Soviet Azerbaijan Republic, and on their return to Tehran the House of Culture (V.O.K.S.) held a reception to give other Persians the opportunity of being impressed by their sycophantic descriptions of their experiences. 11 The Soviet Ambassador is pressing the Persian Government to send a battalion of Persian troops to Mahabad. This battalion must, however, come from Tabriz; it must not be replaced, so leaving Tabriz with no troops other than one battalion of 400 semi-trained recruits. To the protest that it would be unwise to despatch to Mahabad. occupied and surrounded by armed Kurds, so small a force as 400 infantry soldiers, the ambassador replied that the Soviet authorities would guarantee their safety. It looks as if the Russians wished to reduce the Persian garrison in Tabriz and have a Persian battalion interned by the Kurds at Mahabad as the small Persian garrison is practically interned at Rezaieh. The refusal of the Russians to allow^ the Persian Government to send an adequate force to Mahabad has been referred to in Summary No. 18/45 and previous Summaries. American Interests. 12. The Persian Gulf Command will cease to operate the Persian Railway at the end of June. The Persian authorities are taking over by stages and by the end of the month they will be in full control of the railway from Tehran to Ahwaz and Bandar Shahpur. 13. Mr. Wallace Murray has arrived in Tehran as American Ambassador. British Interests. 14. There has been a general strike of Persian employees of the Kermanshah Petroleum Company, instigated by agents of the Tudeh party. Some of the strikers have already gone back to work.

Persian Affairs. Political. 1. A majority of the Deputies has chosen Seyyid Muhsin Sadr (Sadr-ul- Ashraf) (F.O. 194^M.A. 249) for appointment as Prime Minister, and he has been charged by the Shah with the formation of a Government. He is already in difficulties with the Deputies over the selection of his Ministers. In the session of the Majlis held to elect a Prime Minister he was supported by 60 of the 67 members present, but his supporters are already at loggerheads with each other regarding the choice of Ministers for the Ministries of the Interior and of War, the Ministries that have most influence on the elections. Consequently he has not yet been able to present the Cabinet to Parliament. It is understood that he has decided to retain Anushirwan Sepahbudi as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nadir Arasteh as Minister of Roads and Communications, and to include Mahmud Bader (F.O. 40-M.A. 51), Abdul Hussein Hajhir (F.O. 79-M.A. 104), Dr. Said Malek (Lughman-ul-Mulk). The Tudeh party has already declared itself to be in opposition, and another thirty Deputies are unlikely to support the Government whatever its composition. While the Deputies are concerned almost entirely wdth attempting to secure their re-election tne business of administration is falling into serious arrears. The budget for the current year has not yet been discussed; the control of economic affairs is in abeyance and there are many important questions for decision, notably the arrangements to be made for the financing of the railway when it passes to the control of the Persian administration, and British contri butions to make up the difference between revenue and expenditure cease on the 1st July. 2 . The desire for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Persia continues to be widely expressed. Even the Tudeh press supports what it must realise to be the genuine wish of all politically-minded classes. But it stresses the necessity for a complete withdrawal. It is perhaps affected by the arguments put forward in some quarters that even if the British have some justification for staying the Russians have none. The Russians probably feel safe in advocating complete withdrawal, having good cause to expect that the British intend to remain in Khuzistan at least. 3. All internees have now been released with the exception of fourteen. For this the Minister for Foreign Affairs has gained some much-needed credit. Economic. 4. Discussions to settle the details of the transfer of the railway south of Tehran to the Persian administration and the amount of rolling stock to be handed over by the British and Americans have been held and the decisions reached await confirmation by the Governments concerned. The Persian administration begins to take over on the 18th June. The Americans have agreed to allow a‘number of their technical staff to remain to help the Persians in the transition period. The present financial arrangement w’hereby the British Government makes good the difference between revenue and expenditure ceases to be effective on the 30th June. Some economy can be effected by a reduction of staff, now considerably in excess of the requirements of normal Persian traffic, but even then a considerable increase in freight rates will be necessary if revenue is to balance costs. And the discharge of a large number of employees will sw^ell the ranks of the unemployed and the Tudeh party. British Interests. 5. The employees of the Kermanshah Petroleum Company have returned to work with the exception of some 350 wffio, having been absent for a w 7 eek, were [67—64]2 dismissed in accordance with the ordinary rules of the company. The Tudeh press, which had been inciting the employees, made a sudden volte-face, perhaps realising that the strike was doomed to failure, and the official organ of the Tudeh labour organisation published a statement to the effect that the strike had not had its prior approval and that in view of the necessity for not hindering the prosecution of the war against Japan it should be ended as soon as possible. Russian Interests. 6 . It seems that the Persian authorities made some pretence of complying with the Russian demand, reported in Summary No. 18/45, paragraph 6, that the Shahsavan tribes of the Ardebil district and the “ brigands ” (i.e. the landlords) of Mianeh (both areas where Tudeh agitators had been meeting with rough treatment) should be disarmed. The gendarmerie collected five rifles from Mianeh, and a military detachment was sent to the Shahsavan camps to search for rifles. It found none. But the Russians trumped up a charge of harbouring deserters against the Shahsavan chief, Amir Arslan, and insisted on his removal to Tabriz. 7. The two Persian policemen accused of assault on a Russian civilian— see Summary No. 18/45, paragraph 9—have been sentenced by Persian military court to imprisonment for several months. The Persians accused of assault and rape against Russian students are still in Russian custody. Tehran, 10th June, 1945.COPY Ho.

All the above have at one time or another in the past been Cabinet Liinisters, Gulshayan not since Feroughi’s cabinet. He was Mayor of Tehran in 1944* 2. , The Cabinet has not yet been presented to the Majlis. i he opposition, ..hich consists of the 8 Tudeh representatives and some 30 other deputies led by Dr Musaddig, by absenting themselves from the Majlis have ensured that the necessary quorum was not present, some of the deputies of the majority coalition being absent from Tehran. The Chah also, although he authorised Sadr to f rm a Cabinet, is known to be intriguing against him, and it is probably due to his influence that Mtebar and Ardalan have already reoi ned. The Shah ’s- opposition is mainly due to pi : ue and a desire to get even wivn one majority of the deputies for having rejected hakimi ’ s Cabinet which included some I.Iinisters of his own choice. x he deputies of the opposition, but not including the Tudeh representatives, have issued a manifesto ^nnoucing their * /intentionintention to obstruct the Government by all means in their power, since they believed that Sadr had not the equalities necessary for the solution of the problems facing the Government nor did he corn and the confidence of the people. The Tudeh party had previously annouced their o position. '^he x j rirne minister is being vigorously abused bp all the Tress under Pussian influence, hi^torp of nearly 40 years ago being raked up to provide charges against him. Representatives of the majority and minority groups have met and are to meet again to attempt to solve the deadlock. It is understood that the minority, less the Tudeh deputies, have stated that they will support a Cabinet formed by any of the fcblowing, but by no other:- Sadiq (Rustashar-ed-Dpuleh), Bayat, Hakimi or Sepalibuc^i. The Tudeh deputies object to Hakimi and wish to include javam es Sultaneh. 3. The increase of Russian influence in the Lajlis is causing some alarm to those deputies who have hitherto for various reasons opposed Russian transgressions and the Tudeh party because of its Russian direction. In addition to the 8 Tudeh representatives there are now some 2C deputies ho will often vote in accordance with Russian instructions. The fear that this coalition inspires in the remaining hundred deputies arises from their belief that it is supported, guided, inspired and disciplined to united action by the formidable Soviet and from a recognition of their own lack of unity, of leadership and of common, purpose. The British, some of them-think, should play a more active part - sup ort their friends, threaten the wavering, bribe the needy, inspire and subsidize the press and give clear directives of policy. The British, they say, treat their friends no better than their enemies. The Russians reward their friends and murder their enemies | in Persian eyes a sensi le and effective manner of acting. 4. The Persian Government has issued invitations to the Governments of the U.S.3.R., Great Britain, the United Gtates, France, Chin^, India,. Tgypt., Iraq, Syria, Lebanon,- Palestine, Turkey and Afghanistan to send representatives to attend a medical congress in Tehran. The date for the opening session was originally notified as the 23rd June-but it has been postponed until the 1st July. The Persians themselves have no great enthusiasm for this congress having enough sense to realise that nations still at war are not likely to send highly qualified representatives. The suggestion came from the Russians^ and the Persians gave way to Russian pressure and insistence on an early date, the Russian object being apparently i to ensure that they, being-more conveniently situated, will make a better show than any other power.

But if the Government shows weakness in proceeding against those implicated in the murder or in supporting the officials in Isfahan who have taken measures to preserve order it is likely that the Tudeh party will take heart. The public is disturbed by fears that they are already making plans to continue their campaign of intimidation and assassination. Azarbai ,ian.

The statement recently made in the House of Commons by the Government spokesman to the effect that British interests in South Persia and the Persian Gulf wo:ld be safeguarded in all circumstances has given a great opport nity to the ^ussian-inspired Persian Press and to other enemies of Great-Britain to give colour to the accusations they have been making for some’ time of the sinister designs of British policy in South Persia, which are to be achieved through the arming and support of the tribes and the creation of autonomous provinces to be converted, as opportunity offers, into a British.colony, however disguised. Horeover, the defence of British interesto,&gt;these papers say, requires the suppression of all aspirations to freedom lest the British colony of India should be infecte-d by the ideas of the liberty lovers of Persia.

[E 5444/70/34] Copy No. 132 Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 27 for the Period §th July to \5th JwZy, 1945.— {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 248 of l§th July; Received in Foreign Office, 25th July.) Persian Affairs. Political. THE political deadlock continues, the minority insisting that Muhsin Sadr must resign, the majority refusing to be dictated to by the minority. The majority have now sufficient Deputies to form a quorum but insufficient, in the absence of the minority, for a question to be put to the vote. For this it is necessary that three-quarters of the number of Deputies present in Tehran should be present in the Majlis. 2. Seyyid Zia’s speech to his followers, mentioned in Summary No. 26/45, paragraph 3, which was printed and widely distributed, called forth a violent and abusive rejoinder in Pravda, later broadcast from Moscow. Seyyid Zia himself, the Prime Minister and his Government, friends of the British and every element in Persia that does not truckle to the Tudeh party are attacked with much venom. The reactionaries, it says, have greatly intensified their activities to suppress the movement for freedom and are organising terrorist groups, arming the tribes and forming tribal unions with a view to attacking not only the Tudeh party but also Russian interests. The publication of such an article in an official organ of the Soviet Government is obviously meant to leave on Persian minds the impression that Russia may resort to forcible measures if Persians continue to oppose Russian designs. The Russians began to broadcast the article from the Tehran Wireless Station in the period allotted to the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society for cultural talks; but to hear themselves abused from their own broadcasting station was too much for the Persian authorities, who closed it down and announced immediately afterwards that the Russian broadcast was not in accordance with the conditions on which the Allies were allowed to use the station. In present conditions it is only the Russian version of. the situation in Persia, a version grossly false in many important respects, that reaches the world, since the Russian members of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian censorship stop every press message that reports the true facts. 3. The broadcast from Angora stating that the annexation of Persian Azarbaijan to Russia had been demanded by a provincial committee in Azarbaijan (see Summary No. 26/45, paragraph 2) has forced even the Tudeh papers to deny that there is any demand among Persian Azarbaijanis for the secession of their province to Russia or any desire on Russia’s part to acquire any Persian territory. 4. The Medical Congress (see Summary No. 23/45, paragraph 4 ), after a week of daily conferences, was closed on the 8 th July. It was evident that the idea of this congress had been forced on the Persians by the Russians to provide the latter with an international audience for their propaganda. Economic. 5. The Executive Committee of the Government Economic Council has asked for a credit of 10 million tomans to pay for the 815 motor vehicles, surplus to Allied military requirements, which have been offered to the Persian Government by the American authorities. Persian Forces. A rmy. 6 . The Ministry for War has decided to construct houses in the vicinity of barracks for the accommodation of officers. Five million rials are to be borrowed from the army bank for this purpose. [69—4]2 7. A number of conscript officers have been released from the army before the end of their full period of compulsory service in order to effect economy in army expenditure. Gendarmerie. 8 . Headquarters of districts have now been abolished in the gendarmerie except in Ears and Azarbaijan, and regiments will in future be under the direct command of central gendarmerie headquarters in Tehran. This is likely to handicap co-operation between the civil and military authorities in the provinces on the one hand and the gendarmerie on the other. Previously the district commander, whose command extended over the province, was located at the provincial capital in close contact with the Governor-General and with divisional headquarters. There is in any case little co-operation and much antagonism between the army and the gendarmerie. 9. Colonel Schwarskopf, American adviser to the gendarmerie, who has been for the past months in America, has retrned to Tehran. He informed the Persian press that the purpose of his journey was to obtain supplies for the Persian gendarmerie and that he had been successful. Internal Security. Fars and Kuhigalu. 10 . Later reports indicate that Muhammad Ali Liravi’s outburst against Fathullah Hiatdaudi’s properties near Liravi (see Summary No. 26/45, para graph 9) is not so serious as to be likely to require the intervention of troops. Although there have been a few casualties, the dispute seems susceptible of settlement by negotiation. Nasir Qashgai, fortified by the encouragement of Qavam-ul-Mulk, has arrived in Tehran to make, it is hoped, his peace with the Shah and the general staff. Southern Kurdistan. 11 . It is reported that the column of Persian troops operating in southern Kurdistan to which reference was made in Summary No. 25/45, paragraph 6 , met with some opposition before it succeeded in entering Rezab and that both sides suffered casualties. Hamadan. 12 . Tudeh demonstrations in Hamadan during the first fortnight in July have led to conflicts with the police resulting in injuries to both sides and the. arrest of Tudeh leaders. Russian Affairs. 13. Reports, not yet fully confirmed, say that the control of affairs in Gilan and Mazanderan is passing into the hands of Tudeh committees or Soviets. Azarbaijan the process of substituting Russian control, whether exercised direct or through the Tudeh party, for Persian continues steadily. Some landlords of Maragheh were prevented from visiting their estates by a party of rudeh toughs. Two Shahsevan chiefs (see Summary No. 25/45 paragraph 4 ) are still detained in Tabriz by the Russians and the Persian subjects accused oi assault on some Russian civilians are still in Russian custody. The Irano- Soviet Cultural Society has now monopolised the whole of the municipal garden m Tabriz.

Great Britain is accused of opposing all movements of freedom and progress and of deliberatelv weakening small Powers so that British imperialism may be’dominant ' ^ !5. The Soviet Consul-General in Khuzistan has recently made an extended tour of east Persia, visiting Tabas, Yazd, Kerman, Zahedan/Mirjawa Zabul and Birjand. Photographs were taken of the airfields constructed by the British which are of much interest to the Russians. ^ ’ 16 _ ^ e P° r u ts continue to be received of an increase of Russian troops on the Perso-Turkish border and of the construction of defences, but they have not yet3 been confirmed by any reliable source. Manoeuvres of Russian troops did take place along the frontier m June, but no reliable information is available as to he number of troops that took part. The suspicion is frequently voiced that the desire to bring pressure on Turkey is an added reason for the retention of Russian troops m Azarbaijan. [Tehran, 15th July, 1945. Appendix A. Summary of Article in Newspaper Mardum of §th July, 1945. k, ^ discusses the Soviet note to Turkey and the false news item broadcast by Angora Radio concerning Azarbaijan, and states that some people had been surprised at the suddenness of the Soviet note, but if the course of events was todowed and various items of news were fitted together, one would find that the Soviet measure had not been sudden, but merely one in a series of notes and discussions concerning the probable revision of the^ Turko-Soviet Treaty. After enumerating the Soviet demands, the writer states that the Russian note was not m the lorm of an ultimatum, and a specific time-limit had not been fixed. Anv time the lurkish Government wished to open negotiations she could express her acceptance of the terms. Not only the Soviet Union, but any independent and lee nation had the right to specify the terms on which negotiations with another Government should be carried on or refrain from concluding a treaty with a country whose attitude she considered unfriendly to herself. Commenting on the teims, the wiitei states that Kars and Ardahan had been ceded to Turkey at a time when the newly formed Soviet Government was suffering from the ravages of war and she did not wish to have any differences with the new Turkey whose friendship she desired. She had even helped the Turkish Government, but experience had shown that Turkey preferred to follow other ways than friendship with the Soviet Union. Her attitude to Fascist Germany proved that she was waiting for an opportunity to stab Russia in the back. She was not satisfied with Kars and Ardahan and talked of Pan-Turkism and wished to establish a Greater Turkey. The tone of the Angora Radio and the Turkish press showed that upon the fall of Stalingrad she would attack Caucasus. Her attitude towards the trial of those who had made an attempt on the life of Von Papen left no trace of doubt as to her lack of sincerity towards the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union could not forget that she had to keep many divisions of the Red armv idle on the Turkish frontiers when she could have used them elsewhere. Russian interest in Straits was the result of past experience and the war with Hitlerite Germany. The Soviet Union realised that if an unfriendly Government in Turkey should control the Straits, she would be faced with difficulties. The question of the revision of Balkan frontiers aimed at giving Bulgaria access to the open seas. Unfortunately the Turkish authorities instead of removing their differences with their neighbours tried to extend them so that they could take advantage of the situation. The news concerning Azarbaijan was an example of this. The Persians should realise that the position of their country was different from that of Turkey. Persia had joined the United Nations and had contributed her share to the victory and expected to be rewarded. To obtain her rights, Persia should be sincere in her protestations, and prove that she was in favour of preserving friendly relations with her neighbours and establishing perfect democracy in her country. One of the conditions laid down by U.S.S.R. for opening negotiations with Turkey was the fact that Turkey should have a democratic regime It was natural on the part of the Soviet Union to make such a demand. After having made such sarcrifices she did not wish to see a Fascist regime established in Turkey. Appendix B. Summary of Extract from Persian Newspaper Rahbar of Vlth July, 1945. A LEADER states that when war broke out in 1939 the balance which existed in the inter-war years had collapsed. This balance was based upon Britain’s supremacy, wrapped up in the political machinations of the League of Nations. It was also based upon the encirclement of Russia, ostracising her and excluding America from Europe. It culminated in the tragedy of Munich,4 support of fascism and the bloody war which ensued. Europe was steeped in blood, artificial frontiers collapsed, puppet Governments fled and Britain was compelled to drag Russia and America into the political crisis of Europe and the world. Realising the impossibility of re-establishing the past balance in Europe, Britain now focussed her attention on the Middle East and tried to consolidate that area, with which her economic and political interests were connected, against th^ evolution of world policy. The aim of this policy was the exclusion of other rivals from the Middle East. Russia and France had vital interests in the Middle ■ East. Britain tried to come to terms with America with a view to expelling Russia and France from the Middle East. The oil conference and other economic negotiations in Cairo and elsewhere with America were aimed at luring in America, while the organising of the Arab federation, the far-fetched plans for the arming of the tribes and their union, interference in Greece and the formation of a special regime in that country, repeated meetings between British and Turkish statesmen, &amp;c., were aimed at excluding Russia and France from the Middle East. Believing that she dominated the Middle East, Britain interfered in Syria and created a crisis in her relations with France, the repercussions of which were felt in the West. In the same way that the uselessness of the idea of a ‘ ‘ separate peace or “ regional wars ’ ’ was proved, a world balance could not be partial or local. The great evolutions and progressive movements created in Europe could not be confined to that continent, and while the collapse of German fascism had brought about a new balance of Europe, the effects of this change were manifest in the Middle East, where the situation was bound to follow the general trend of the world. The principles of this new balance would be : (1) the destruction of the domination of any Great Power and of a one-sided policy so that all interested countries might enjoy an equal status in sharing in the solution of general affairs; (2) dictatorial and Fascist regimes, and the influence of imperialism which prevailed in most Middle East countries, would be exterminated.EXT 3 7 8 7 No.4 2/28/45 .

Only a Persian could fail to see anything inconsistent in Nasir*s adoption of the role of mentor and in his conveniently forgetting his own past share in weakening Persia be harbouring her enemies and maintaining in Pars an armed rebellion against the central authority.

Sou thern Kurdistan. 11. No further news has been received about the activities of the Persian Army column which enbered RSZAB (sec pare. 11 of last IntjSumy:). Its tasks, as enumerated by the Chief of the General Staff, seem ill-defined. It is to show the flag in those more/remoto parts of Southern Kurdistan which lie between the Scnnandaj- Her Ivan and Kermanchah - Maud shah roads, to destroy any armod force of Kurds which may oppose it and to cut off those tribes living round Merivan from support by the Avroman tribes to the South.

BRITISH INTERESTS. 13 * H,M.Government are reminded from time to time that the Persian Government has not given up its claim to BAHREIN. The claim is rather shadowy as it is based on a total period of severedgnty of 570 years in the last 17 centuries of which 350 years belong to the pro -11 iharmaGan era. In more recent times Persia cannot be said to have exercised effective rule for more than 167 years in the aggregate, and it is now ova- 160 years since she last held the islands. The Persian claim was restated recently in the Russian sponsored paper 'RAHBAR'. Still more recently a party of Bahreini pilgrims bound for MESHED were stooped in KHCRRAI:3HAHR on the grounds that, being Persian subjects, their British passports were invalid. The party has now returned to BAHREIN and their passports, which had been impounded by the Persian authorities,have been recovered. /V±f EXT 5787 - 5 - &gt; \ CHINESE INTOGSTS . 1 1945 14* Dr Soong, on his return from Mo scot, arrived in Tehran on 14th July and left for Chungking on the 15th, ERAZ ILI/ JI INTERESTS * 15* H.E. , The Brazilian Minister left Tehran on transfer on 13th Jul^^ No successor has arrived as yet.THIS DOCUMENT IS FILE COPY THE PROPERTiOF HIS / V c 7 A ilndcA, ' ^ -t-cAjL LciXu HAT C&amp;iclco^ t »R anVRRNMENT S BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT *43.

Political. 1. The Majlis stalemate continues. A recent debate was enlivened by exchanges between the windy and woolly Dr. Musaddiq and Ali Dashti. The -doctor maintained that free elections could not be held as long as foreign troops were on Persian soil. He was equally averse to postponing the elections until the evacuation of Persia by foreign troops had been completed, because that was an act contrary to the laws of the constitution. He maintained his point of view that the present Government was not representative of and did not enjoy the support of the people. In the meantime Government business is at a standsti . The voting of a proportion of two-twelfths of the annual budget, subsequently amended to one-twelfth, to meet the cost of Government salaries was, however, proceeded with and passed largely owing to the efforts of Ali Dashti. 2. The Persian delegation to the San Francisco Conference has returned. Internal Security. Southern Kurdistan. 3. According to the latest information given by the Chief of the General Staff, the Persian army column has pushed on from Rezab for a distance of some' 15 miles and the Kurdish insurgents are now split into two groups, one about 15 miles south-west of Rezab and the other just short of the Perso-Iraqi boundary. As the result of the successful outcome of the skirmishes at Menvan and Rezab and the retirement of the insurgents to positions further west, the Chief of the General Staff regards the first phase of the operations as success fully completed and is confident of the successful outcome of the second phase, i.e. disarmament. When asked what tactics he intended to adopt if the Kuids refused to stand their ground and let themselves be disarmed, he glibly assumed that the Iraqi army would take up positions along the frontier so as to bar Kurdish ingress into Iraq. Sarlashgar Amanullah Jehanbani has left on a special mission to Kurdistan, from which he is due to return in a fortnight with a report on the advisability of the operations, their possible scope and their conduct. Pars. 4. Some raiding by Darrashuri tribesmen in Ganduman Burujin and by the Kuhgilu in Janeki Sardsir is reported. According to a report received in the General Staff hut not confirmed from consqlar sources, Kamaraji of Kamanj, in the face of a threat of punitive action by the Kazerun garrison, has made his submission and handed in the Government rifles which he acquired by burning and looting a gendarmerie post some months ago. Khuzistan. 5 With reference to Intelligence Summary No. 25, paragraph 7, eighteen rebel sheikhs were captured in all, but Yunis Ali made good his escape. They are to be tried by a military court. Some sympathy for the sheikhs is felt bv the Governor-General, a Majlis Deputy and others who feel that they had much provocation for their acts in the land settlement which General Humayuni sought to impose on them, probably not without profit to himself. [ 68 — 111 } INDIA OFFICE2 Khorasan. 6. The first meeting of Seyyid Zia’s Iradeh-i-Milli party was staged to take place in Meshed on the 22nd July. During the early morning of that day Soviet soldiers, accompanied by Persian police, arrested about seventeen members of the working committee of the party, including the brother of Seyyid Zia. Their houses were searched and all documents relating to the party were^ confiscated. They are at present believed to be in custody at the Soviet Military™ Headquarters. A zarbaijan. 7. Hatim, one of the Shahsevan chiefs, is reported to have been released by the Russians, though Amir Aslan is still in their custody. 8. An unconfirmed report states that several thousand people, including Armenians and Assyrians, attempted to emigrate into the U.S.S.R. They did not receive permits and after some days of hardship at Julfa returned to their homes. British Interests. 9. Major-General W. A. K. Fraser, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., M.V.O., M.C., left Tehran on the 26th July for the United Kingdom on relinquishing the appointment of British Military Attache. Russian Interests. 10. Of recent weeks the Russians, foreseeing perhaps stronger demands from Persia and her late Allies for evacuation, have intensified their efforts to produce administrative chaos in the zones occupied by themselves and to ensure in the event of their departure before the next elections take place, that only a Government completely subservient to themselves shall come into power. The anti-British tone of the Russian-controlled press has become more violent. They have openly threatened prominent politicians and public men with their grave displeasure unless they would obey their orders. They have boasted that &amp; now victory in Europe has been achieved they are free to turn their attention to Asia and to arrange things there to their satisfaction. Some of them have openly stated that Stalin will never give up Persia nor the Red army evacuate it to allow it to become a hotbed of intrigue by imperialists directed against the Soviet Lmon. they have egged on toughs of the Tudeh party to usurp the functions of government in Azarbaijan and the Caspian provinces, where they have forbidden the export of wheat or rice and have even taken cash deposits from drivers of Pei sum Government trucks leaving those areas on Persian Government business. The\ ha\e forced the drivers to carry a spare driver, who must be provided from the ranks of the unemployed under Tudeh control. They utilise time allotted bv the Persian Government radio for their Cultural Society to broadcast its own propaganda directed against their Persian political opponents, who are dubbed reactionaries, Fascists and imperialists. They oppose the lifting of the Tripartite censorship lest the truth about their activities in Persia should leak out to the outside world On a recent occasion they made so bold as to use their soldiery m the British-controlled area of Khorramshahr to search the house of two suspects borne property was removed and the two suspects were later arrested by the Persian authorities as the result of pressure brought to bear bv^the Russians on the Persian Government in Tehran. ’ 11. The Russian trade union delegation has completed a tour of the Caspian provinces and is shortly to leave for Tabriz. The Russian press and the Russian-controlled Persian press has devoted much space to the wonderful i eception given to them, and the spontaneous welcome shown by the 250 000 Tudeh members in Persia. A conservative estimate of' the total industrial population of Persia is 150,000, and by no means all of these are members of the Tudeh party, though many are daily being forced into joining by exclusion unless possessed of a Tudeh membership card, from the utilisation of nublic transport facilities and even the weekly visit to the public bath.3 French Interests. 12- ^ r niing to a press message from the Agence Pars, the French Ministry for hoit gn Afiairs has decided to raise the status of its legation in Tehran to that of an embassy. ft In Tehran In Isfahan In Ahwaz 2,459 216 1,108 Total 3,783 14.

Political. Persian Affairs. THE situation in the Majlis has remained virtually unchanged. The minority continue their tactics of obstruction and the majority refuse to withdraw their support of Sadr. The minority issued a manifesto, signed by Dr. Musaddiq, Hikmat, Farivar, Tehranchi, Iskandiari, Raji and Afkhami, which explained their reasons for opposing Sadr. Some press representatives were invited to attend a special meeting at the Majlis, where Ali Dashti replied for the majority to the manifesto. An attempt by some of the more moderate Deputies of both sides to come to an understanding was foiled by Dr. Musaddiq, who refused to have anything to do with the written agreement produced by them. The minority are now reported to be seeking another interview with His Imperial Majesty the Shah at which they intend to reiterate their objections to Sadr and to inform the Shah that, as'long as he remains, they will neither participate in Majlis business nor accept responsibility for the government of the country. 2. The newspapers Nida-yi-Millat, Nida-yi-Adalat, Kishvar and Arzu have been suppressed at the request of the Russians. 3. ' The newspaper Rahhar, the leading Russian-controlled paper, has published a statement to the effect that the Russian Embassy have officially announced that they have no objection to the release of the remaining internees and that their further retention must be considered as being at the insistence of the British authorities. 4. A large Tudeh meeting was held on the 5th August. Over 5,000 people are said to have attended. They moved in procession through the town to the Majlis square. Their behaviour throughout was orderly. 5. On the 2nd August, after a delay of several days in order that the Russian and American Embassies might receive their instructions (they have not as yet been received), the Persian Government was informed by His Majesty’s Embassy of the recent decision of the Potsdam Conference to evacuate Allied troops from Tehran at once. Gratitude on the part of the Persian Government for British efforts at achieving this decision was hardly to be expected, but, even so, the Persian reaction was disappointing. They were suspicious of Russian intentions because the Russian Embassy had as yet made no communication on this subject; they had hoped that the whole of Persia would be evacuated within three months and, though they would never admit it, they were probably apprehensive of a sharp decline in security now that the evacuation, for which they had clamoured so loudly, was actually about to begin.

Persian Affairs. Political. THE Majlis deadlock continues. The President and some of the Deputies were invited to tea by His Imperial Majesty the Shah on the 7th August. From press reports of the meeting the Shah does not seem to have done more than discuss generalities, with emphasis on Persia’s great need for increased irrigation. A public session of the Majlis was to have been held on the 9th August, but the minority adopted their usual tactics of preventing it by their absence. There seems to be a growing conviction that Sadr will not get his required majority and that he will be forced to resign. The Shah is believed to favour this and to prefer his own previous choice of Hakimi. That the Shah should advise the minority to cease their opposition on condition that Sadr resigned was, however, ruled out by some of the Deputies on the grounds that this would constitute a dangerous precedent for interference by the Sovereign and also for future obstructionist tactics by any minority which desired the removal of a Prime Minister. 2. The Soviet Ambassador has now received his instructions (see paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary), and on the 9th August informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the decision to evacuate Tehran forthwith. 3. The recent visit of the Soviet trade union delegation and the question of the representation of the Tudeh at the forthcoming Paris conference has stirred up rival unions to apply for membership. Such are the Workers’ and Peasants’ Union of Yusuf Iftekhari and the anti-Tudeh Union in Isfahan.

According to a press report, the Ministry of Roads and Communications has decided to complete the construction of the Mianeh-Tabriz and Shahrud- Meshed sections of railway. The completion of these sections was part of the original project and it is known that the Persian Government is anxious to provide work for those thrown out of employment as the result of the cessation of Allied war effort in Persia, but, even so, the above announcement must be regarded as premature as the Government has not got the money to spend on rail way construction on a scale which will complete this work in the near future. Internal Security. Pars. 6. (See Intelligence Summary No. 28, paragraph 10.) The latest news of this dispute is that the Persian military authorities intend to disarm both the Fathullah Hiat Daudi and Muhammad Ali Lirawi factions. The Chief of the General Staff has been informed by the British military authorities that, in view of Fathullah Khan’s long-standing friendship with the British, his success in maintaining order in his area with the help of the 200 Persian Government rifles [69—5] *2 which he holds and his valuable help in securing grain supplies for Bushire town, it might be an act of doubtful wisdom to disarm him at the present time. Khuzistan. 7. The following note on the land settlement in Dasht-i-Mishan has been taken from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General’s Diary No. 13 : f \ y “ The Tehran commission charged with the examination of the whole question of the Dasht-i-Mishan lands and with making recommendation about future policy has made its report. It consisted of representatives of the Ministeries of the Interior, Justice, War, and Finance, the last being Mr. Solomon; and the Majlis Deputy Hussein Farhudi, who has been showing a praiseworthy and (considering the weather) surprising interest in the affairs of his constituency. The result of their deliberations has been the adoption of Mr. Solomon’s plan of allotting all the land afresh, on a communal village basis, the heads' of families being named collectively in the title-deeds. This would greatly shorten the task of registration and enable the villagers them selves to sub-divide the land annually in accordance with the exigencies of the moment; the land, in fact, would be held in undivided shares known by the term “ musha.' Certain taxes which used to be collected by the sheikh are to be abolished, the onlv tax remaining being the smaller one payable to the “ mubashir ” or Kedkhuda. The sheikhs, if friendly, will get up to twenty shares of land, but will have no privileges. It remains to be seen whether this arrangement will work : the peasants ought to welcome it, but, of course, the sheikhs will not, and it will need strong and impartial handling, with frequent inspections.” Khorasan. 8. As a result of the arrest by the Russians of prominent members of Seyyid Zia’s Iradeh-i-Milli party (referred to in paragraph 7 of last Intelligence Summary) a reliable report states that Russian-Tudeh liaison is even more in evidence. The Persians, under Russian pressure, are prosecuting non-Tudeh Government employees and forcing them to subscribe to a Russian newspaper. 9. A mass emigration movement, suspiciously akin to that reported from Azerbaijan and alluded to in paragraph 8 of last Intelligence Summary, is reported also from Khorasan. The Soviet Consul-General is said to have received 12,000 applications from Turki and Turcoman motor drivers and others to acquire Soviet nationality and migrate to the U.S.S.R. 10. A party of Indian pilgrims bound for Meshed was held up and robbed by armed bandits about 40 miles south of the town. Kurdistan. 11. The Chief of the General Staff had no news of interest about these operations and is probably waiting for the return of Sarlash Jehanbani with his report. He mentioned that Jehanbani had telegraphed to advise the despatch of yet another infantry battalion. The Chief of the General Staff intends to send as reinforcements the infantry battalion now located as a temporary measure at Abadeh in Fars. A zerbaijan. 12. The Soviet Trade Union delegates have visited Tabriz, where they were officially welcomed by the Acting Governor-General. They were accompanied by three Tehran trade unionists. They inspected various factories, where they talked with the workers, but ignored the managers. They have left Azerbaijan for Tehran on their way home to Russia. They are not visiting Abadan, though this was included in an itinerary published in the Persian press some weeks ago. Chinese Interests. 13. Dr. Soong, Prime Minister, Dr. Wong Shih-chieh, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a son of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek passed through Tehran on their way to Moscow to resume conversations with the Soviet Government.

Persian Affairs. Political. 1. The minority refuse to come to terms with the majority, and by their continued absence from Majlis sessions have kept all parliamentary business at a standstill. There is increasing evidence that Sadr is finding his position as Prime Minister untenable. A further supply of money, in the shape of a l/12th Budget Bill, must be voted in the near future and many think that the occasion will be taken by the minority to force a decision. 2. ' This paralysis at the centre is rapidly affecting the provinces. Ali Mansur has arrived in Tehran from Khorasan and is probably busy assessing his chances of obtaining office as Prime Minister should the present Government fall. Firuz is still in Tehran and it is rumoured that he will not return to Ears. Bahrami is also in the capital and has said that he will not return to Kerman. Azerbaijan is still without a Governor-General since the departure of Dadvar many months ago. There were also reports of a change in Khuzistan but the latest news is that Misbah Fatemi is to remain. Kermanshah has at long last received a Governor-General, Kalantari, a hitherto unknown official of the Ministry of Interior, having been appointed. 3. Much discussion is taking place as to whether the new parliamentary elections should be postponed till all foreign troops have left Persia. Dr. Musaddiq, whose logic is at times difficult to follow, thinks that they should not be postponed, not because the postponement is inexpedient, but because it is contrary to the Constitution. At the same time he maintains that the electoral laws require redrafting. Who is to redraft them when he has brought all Majlis business to a standstill the worthy Doctor has not revealed. Normally the life of the present Majlis would end about the 12th March, 1946, and the new elections should begin three months and the public notices announcing the election should be issued five months before that date. The Court. 4. H.I.M. the Shah paid a visit during the week to the Ear valley, where he inspected the preliminary work now being carried out by Messrs.

[69—31]2 Persian Forces. Gendarmerie. 6. A recent reform of Colonel Schwarzkopf is proving of doubtful value. He considered rightly that small posts of four men were an easy target for robbers. One of the inmates of these small posts was usually absent, one was not uncommonly sick, one had gone to extract supplies from a nearby village and the remaining custodian was normally asleep. The post and its arms there for were an easy prey. He decided to scrap the small posts and concentrate his men __ in platoon posts at greater distances apart. A deficiency of M.T. and a failure to keep roadworthy the little transport that they have has defeated Colonel Schwarzkopf's plans. The posts are now not infrequently 30 miles apart and, as they have not the means of patrolling, the intervening stretches of road are a happy hunting ground for bandits.

Internal Security. b ars. 8. Three gendarmes were recently shot dead by a Qashgai band on the road between Khan-i-Zinian and Dasht Arjin. This murder is said to be in revenge for an affray which took place near Ardekan of a month ago. 9. The Tudeh party recently opened a club at the sugar factory at Mervdasht. On the 9th August a crowd incited by local landlords and the Democrat party attacked and burnt the club. The Majlis Deputy Muaddel is suspected of implication as one of the chief landlords of the district. Two mullahs are also reported to have been sent by Qavam-ul-Mulk to stir up anti- Tudeh feeling. Kurdistan. 10. Security on the Senneh-Kermanshah road is deteriorating and two incidents of highway robbery have taken place recently. In one of the incidents two British employees of the Kermanshah Petroleum Company were the victims. According to a senior officer of the Gendarmerie recently arrived from these parts, the closing down of a number of small Gendarmerie posts has facilitated the task of the bandits. Azerbaijan. 11. The situation in Azerbaijan has deteriorated sharply during the past week. On the 11th August a gang of Tudeh agitators visited the village of Likhvan near Tabriz and attempted to incite the peasants to withhold the land lord’s share of the harvest in accordance with the Tudeh programme of agrarian reform. The landlord, Intisham, and his supporters interrupted the agitators and beat them. A partv of Tudeh said to number 200 and to be armed with revolvers and daggers, then went to the village where a fight ensued. The proprietor, his grandson and a servant were killed by the gang. The Tudeh on their side suffered casualties amounting to 4 killed and several wounded. The landlord’s son was taken away captive to Tabriz. On their return to Tabriz the Tudeh ordered the closing of all Government departments and shops in mourning for their dead. A request by the Ministry of War to despatch troops from the capital in answer to an appeal for reinforcements by the G.O.C. Tabriz has been refused by the Russians. A Commission of Enquiry has been allowed to proceed. It comprises General Amanullah Jehanbani (recently returned from his inspection of the Kurdistan operations), Brigadier Khosrow Panah (Chief of the Gendarmerie), Ahmadi (a former Governor of Tabriz), and a Colonel Taras of the Persian General Staff.K horns an. 12. Much excitement has been caused by a report, unconfirmed as yet from consular sources but believed to be substantially true, to the effect that 17 Persian army officers, including one lieutenant-colonel, have deserted from Meshed with arms and joined a gang of Turcoman bandits. According to the Persian General Staff, the Russians have refused a request by the G.O.C. Meshed Division to be allowed to send a punitive column into the area where the gang now is.

[E 6557/70/34] Persian Affairs. Political. THE Majlis majority and minority have not yet come to any agreement and the position shows little change. A special session of the Majlis to mark the end of the war with Japan was held on the 16th August, but the minority did not attend owing to the non-acceptance of their proposal that the Cabinet should not be present and that only the Presidential body of the Majlis should speak. A special session was convened at the request of the Prime Minister on the 18th August at which he blamed the minority for holding up business and said that, although the Government was capable of dealing w T ith current affairs and crises itself, it considered the support of all Deputies desirable. The cause of this particular crisis was the events in Khorasan (see paragraph 8 below) closely following upon those in Azerbaijan. He proposed to make them a test case to determine the fate of the Cabinet in the Majlis. A debate ensued as the result of which all the majority Deputies affirmed their confidence in Sadr, declared that the minority by their obstructionist tactics were responsible for the disturbances in the various parts of the country and proposed to hold daily sessions at which those minority Deputies who wished to might attend. The Minister for War also made a statement on the recent mutiny in Khorasan (see paragraph 8 below) and urged the speedy passing of the budget to provide the necessary money for the army to carry out their task of restoring law and order in the country. 2. The recent speeches by Mr. Bevin and Mr. Eden in the House of Commons have had a very good effect in this country. Nearly all Persians have been greatly heartened by the references to Persia by the reassuring statement about the reasons for Allied troops entering the country and the equally cogent reasons for now leaving it, and by the condemnation of the system of zones of influence. The overwhelming majority of Persians appreciate the efforts of His Majesty’s Government on their behalf at Potsdam; the recent publicity given to Russian behaviour in Persia; these recent speeches in the House and what they believe to be our attitude to the early removal of censorship. 3. Not much reliance is placed on a recent statement by a Deputy to the effect that over seventy Deputies had signed a proposal to postpone the elections till one month after the last of the Allied troops had left Persia. 4. The Cabinet has tightened up the military governorship of Tehran by reimposing a curfew from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. and by the prohibition of all outdoor political demonstrations. These measures were introduced to prevent any repercussions in the capital of the recent events in Azerbaijan and Khorasan and of the arrest of some officers and despatch to the south of others suspected of either plotting with the Russians or of complicity in the Khorasan mutiny. Economic. 5. The Council of Ministers has reconstituted the Foreign Exchange Control Commission under the Ministry of Finance. Dr. Sajjadi has been appointed director. A black market for dollars and pounds has already come into existence. Communications. 6. According to the Persian press the Persian State Railway has claimed, and according to the British Transportation Directorate is likely to claim, from [69—95]the Allies a sum of 100 million tomans (about £7,700,000) on account of freight charges. This is in excess of the £16,500,000 already paid by the Allies to keep the railway going. The Persian State Railway is claiming the full freight rate instead of the agreed rate of -30 rials per ton/kilom. so far paid by the Allies. The Persians base their claim on the fact that, though discussions took place, no railway agreement was ever signed. A py ointments — Civil. 7. —{i) Dr. Ali Sajjadi to be Governor of Saveh.

(vii) Sadiq Fatemi, Inspector-General of the Registration Department, is appointed Director-General in the Ministry of Interior. Internal Security. Khorasan. 8. Further details are now known of the recent mutiny of Persian army officers in Meshed (see paragraph 12 of last Intelligence Summary) on the 16th August. Thirteen officers, including a Lieut.-Colonel Nawai of the Supply and Transport Department, 2 majors, 5 captains, 5 subalterns, and 4 or 5 soldiers obtained possession of a jeep, 2 lorries, a W/T set and arms and ammunition. To prevent pursuit they immobilised the remaining army vehicles by removing their switch keys and by putting salt in their petrol tanks (sugar, though more effective, is too expensive in Persia). With the connivance of the Russian control post (some say avoiding the control post by a detour) they made their way to Bujnurd, having taken the precaution of cutting the telegraph lines between Meshed and Kuchan. On arrival there they gave out that they were come on an inspection of the cavalry squadron stationed there. This they disarmed and made for the Turcoman Sahra. It was thought in Meshed, and the General Staff was so informed by the Russians, that these mutineers would join forces with a band of armed Turcomans, said to number between 1,000 and 2,000, and subsequently attack Meshed. The Chief of the General Staff, having much experience of Russians, did not think that they would go out of their way to give him accurate information about a gang of mutineers with whom they were probably in sympathy, nor did he think it likely that the Russians would tamely allow them to attack one of their garrison towns. He acted, therefore, on the assumption that their information was wilfully misleading and reckoned on the mutineers heading in the opposite direction. Having no troops in Gunbad-i-Qabus, through which place they must pass, he asked for the assistance of the gendarmerie, who acted with the greatest promptness and energy. The local commandant, a lieutenant, hurriedly collected the men from their scattered posts and was able to assemble a force of about one and a half companies before the mutineers put in an appearance. They demanded right-of-way, but were refused. A battle then ensued, in which the gendarmerie, first putting the vehicles out of action, then fired upon their occupants. Seven of the mutineer officers were killed and two were wounded and taken prisoner. The vehicles, arms and ammunition were recovered. The next day three officers and four men were picked up in an exhausted condition nearby on the road between Gunbad-i-Qabus and Shahrud. General Abdullah Hidayet has left for Meshed on a commission of enquiry. 9. Tudeh activity is increasing and on the night of the 18th August 200 or 300 members of that party, mostly “ Muhajirs,” marched to the Telegraph Office in Meshed, where they demanded the resignation of the Prime Minister. The procession was accompanied by Russian troops armed with tommy guns. New branches of the party have been opened at Fariman and at Gif an in the Yamut Turcoman country. 10. The Russians have opened a branch of the Irano-Soviet Cultural Society at Bujnurd. They are busy canvassing votes for Seyyid Mahdevi, their protege3 * • for the next elections, with a view to displacing the sitting member, Tussi, who is regarded as “ reactionary.” 11. Ihe emigration referred to in paragraph 9 of Intelligence Summary No. 31 appears to be continuing, and some fifty persons are said to have crossed the Soviet frontier already. Applications are received daily and are sent to the Soviet Embassy in Tehran. 12. Ali Mansur, the Governor-General, has returned to his post. While in * ^[Tehran he suggested to the General Staff the removal of Colonel Vossuq, the General Officer Commanding, Khorasan Division, as he was not popular with the Russians. The Russian Military Attache also spoke to the Chief of the General Staff on this subject and, when asked for his reasons for their request replied that Colonel Vossuq did not collaborate with the Russian Commander. The Chief of the General Staff says that he replied that such vague indictments could not be followed up and requested the Russian Military Attache to specify Colonel Vossuq’s acts of non-co-operation. A zerbaijan. 13. The commission of enquiry headed by General Jehanbani has arrived at Rezaieh. The situation is still grave. No further news is to hand from Maragheh, where a band of Tudeh toughs occupied Government offices and gave the officials five days in which to clear out. The Russians have not yet permitted any reinforcements to be sent. There is a garrison of one company in Maragheh and the Chief of the General Staff is anxious as to its fate. 14. The emigration to the U.S.S.R. continues and as many as seventy applications per day are being received, mostly from the minorities, Armenians, Assyrians, &amp;c., and from those comparatively recent emigrants from the U.S.S.R. known as “ Muhajirs.” 15. Russian methods are well illustrated by a report from Astara—a report which, owing to Russian “ censorship ” methods, took twenty-three days to reach the capital. A Russian officer accompanied by a soldier entered the house of the Bakshdar of Astara and shot him dead. Kurdistan. 16. The Chief of the General Staff states that a minor Kurdish chief and about 100 of his followers have surrendered to the more northerly of the Persian army columns near Merivan. The villages of Rezab and Karabad were occupied on the 12th August. A consular source reports that a Colonel Airom has been appointed military governor of Senneh town and that this new appointment does not meet with the aproval of the Governor, Shahub-ud-Douleh, who sees himself being pushed further into the background. While most observers agree that Brigadier Hushmand Afshar is a gallant officer and capable commander, they aver that his harshness, his rapacity and his blind hatred of all things Kurdish • are sowing the seeds of further trouble in that area, Isfahan (see Intelligence Summary No. 15, paragraph 11). 17. The Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem has recently visited Isfahan. He admitted in conversation with His Majesty’s Ambassador that propaganda for the return of Armenians to the U.S.S.R, has undoubtedly been spread. He says that he pointed out to the Isfahan Armenians that Soviet Armenia was a highly developed and full country, and that there would not be jobs or openings for an unlimited number of immigrants. Persia, on the other hand, was undeveloped and under-populated and presented a better field for Armenian enterprise. British Interests. 18. Mr. D. W.

Political. 1. The minority and majority in the Majlis still refuse to come to terms and no Majlis business has been done. On the 26th August the Prime Minister tabled a single article Bill for the ratification of the United Nations Charter. The long-awaited debate on the Government's programme was begun but ended in disorder. An attack was made on the Azerbaijan Deputy, Hovanessian, on account of an article in an Armenian paper published in Tabriz in which he had advocated the retention of Russian troops in Persia for so long as a “ reactionary Government ” was in power. It is believed that the attack would have developed into a request for deprivation of parliamentary immunity and subsequent impeachment, but Hovanessian feigned sickness and made good his escape from the chamber. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 2. The situation in Maragheh (see paragraph 13 of last Intelligence Summary) has deteriorated sharply. The Russian Ambassador officially informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Persian Government was free to take any action it wished in Maragheh and that the leader of the insurgents there, one Kabir, was a charlatan and in no way connected wdth either the Russians or the Tudeh. (Since the Russians have never ceased to affirm that the Tudeh party has no connexion with them the question by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to how the Russian Ambassador knew that Kabir had no connexion with the Tudeh was a shrewd one.) When the Persian garrison, acting on instructions from the G.O.C., Tabriz Division, had effected the arrest of Kabir, the Russian detachment stationed at Maragheh forcibly released him, confined the Persian company to the barracks and posted sentries around them. Kurdistan. 3. General Jehanbani informed the British military attach^ that as the result of his visit to Kurdistan he was not dissatisfied with the progress of these operations. The repulse of Mahmud Khan Kanisenani at Merivan has had a heartening effect on the garrison and a correspondingly disheartening effect on the Kurds. General Hushmand Afshar is making good progress with his circular road from Senneh via the Ab-i-Hang and Durud to Merivan, and the Kurds have been forced back to the hills adjoining the Perso-Iraqi frontier. General Jehanbani is confident that defeats of sufficient severity can be inflicted and arms in sufficient quantity can be collected to merit the withdrawal of the force with most of its objects achieved before winter sets in. Mazanderan. 4. Widespread disturbances are reported from Shahi, Sari, Babul, Chalus and other places where Tudeh and anti-Tudeh elements have come to blows. The latter have been drawn from the local peasantry, urged on by emissaries of Seyyid Zia’s Iradeh-i-Milli party from Tehran. Isfahan. 5. Murteza Quli Khan is reliably reported to be highly incensed at General Humayuni’s failure to prevent large-scale raids on his domains near Deh Diz, [69—120]2 Kuh-i-Sefid and Susan by bands of Balimai and Teyyibi said to number as many as 1,200 men. He even accuses Humayuni of encouraging these raids with a view to discrediting him in the eyes of the Central Government and forcing him to resign. Persian Army. 6. More information about the recent mutiny in Khorassan (see last Intelligence Summary, paragraph 8) has been received. The Chief of the General Staff informed the British military attache that eighteen officers in all deserted from the Meshed garrison. Six officers, headed by a lieut.-colonel on the General Staff, deserted from Tehran and one from Tabriz, and effected a junction with the Meshed mutineers just before the skirmish at Gunbad-i-Qabus. These seven and six of the Meshed mutineers are still at large. Some have made good their escape to a place in the Turcoman Sahra, close to the Russian frontier, and some, including the lieut.-colonel on the General Staff, are known to be in hiding in the house of the Russian commandant at Gunbad-i-Qabus. In Tehran a commission was appointed to examine the antecedents and contacts of officers of the central garrison. Thirty officers have been found to have close contacts with the Tudeh party or the Russians, and have been detained under a clause of the Military Governorship law until military governorship comes to an end. Ten, less deeply implicated, have been sent away to divisions in the south. Further arrests are being made as further details of the mutiny come to light. The Chief of the General Staff, on the strength of the information so far extracted from the captured mutineers, is of the opinion that a plot for a general uprising existed and that the Meshed party acted precipitately, thus causing the general mutiny to go off at half cock. Two officers sent by the General Staff to make a full report on the Gunbad-i-Qabus skirmish and to retrieve the captured vehicles and arms have been sent away by the Russians without being able to complete their task. A party of 200 gendarmes proceeding by lorry as reinforcements for the gendarmerie at Gunbad-i-Qabus has been turned back by the Russians at Firuzkuh. A lorry conveying bombs for the Persian Air Force detachment at Meshed has been turned back by the Russians at Semnan. Reinforcements for the Meshed garrison coming from Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam were stopped at the Russian control post south of Meshed. The fact that the original party of mutineers was able to leave Meshed at all and pass through the Russian control posts en route, the attitude of the Russian-controlled Tudeh party in Meshed and elsewhere towards the mutiny, and the presence in Bujnurd of the Russian Vice-Consul at Meshed a few hours prior to the arrival of the mutineers add to the growing weight of testimony to the effect that the whole affair from beginning to end—and the end is not yet in sight—‘had the knowledge and approval of the Russians. The Chief of the General Staff has compiled a letter giving chapter and verse for all these incidents and others in the past of Russian interference in Persian affairs which the Minister for War is to lay before the Cabinet to induce that body to protest officially to the Russian Ambassador. There is no doubt that the financial embarrassment of the junior officers was a prime cause of the mutiny by rendering them receptive to Tudeh propaganda on the subject of better pay and living conditions and the inefficiency and corruption of their seniors. Economic. 7. The Cabinet has finally sanctioned the abolition of the cotton monopoly. In future there will be no restriction on the local sale or purchase of cotton, but the import of cotton will be subject to permits obtainable from the Ministry of Agriculture. Censorship. 8. The Anglo-Soviet-Persian censorship ceased to function as from the 30th August. The Russian representative, though still without his instructions on the subject, joined in informing the Persian censor that with effect from the 30th August no outgoing or incoming letters or telegrams (including press telegrams) between Persia on the one hand and the British Empire and the United States, or its dependencies on the other, need be shown to the Russian censor.

He was the father of Nizam-ud-din Imami, lately in the employ of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and now on a Persian Government purchasing commission in Bombay, and of Jamal Imami, the Majlis Deputy. Russian Interests. 13. The Russian Ambassador has left for a tour of Azerbaijan, as he said he had received conflicting reports on the local situation. He announced before his departure that he might be visiting Baku also. As might be imagined, this has given rise to various rumours of his recall or of a change of Russian policy in Persia. American Interests. 14. The Commander, United States Persian Gulf Command, has stated that American troops will evacuate Tehran in two echelons on the 15th and 25th September respectively, and that his command will be clear of Persia by the 1st November. After that date the only troops remaining will be the guards on camps, installations, &amp;c., and the personnel of the American Liquidation Com mission. A communique from the United States War Department published in the Tehran Daily News gives the figure of these guards as 2,600. It also states that “ some Army Air Transport Command personnel will be left to continue operation of the plane routes through the country.” The communique also stated that the maximum strength of the United States Persian Gulf Command in Persia at the peak period of “ Aid to Russia ” had been 27,000.

Persian Affairs. Political. E The majority and minority in the Majlis have not succeeded in composing their differences though the minority group did consent to attend sessions and provide the necessary quorum. On the 2nd September the Minister of Finance tabled a 2/12ths budget bill to cover the months of Murdad and Shahriwar (23rd July-21st September). As was to be expected, the United States War Department’s communique, referred to in paragraph 14 of last Intelligence Summary, did not pass unnoticed and Deputy Ardelan asked why 2,600 troops were needed to guard American military assets and why the Americans had not asked the permission of the Persian Government to operate air lines and aerodromes in Persia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the American troops would only remain in Persia until American military assets were disposed of. At the session of the 4th September Deputy Dr. Abduh, a member of the Persian delegation to the San Francisco Conference, made a long and carefully rehearsed speech in which he described the activities of the conference, the drafting of the charter and its application to the Persia of to-day. After referring gratefully to the recent speeches of Mr. Bevin and Mr. Eden he com plained of the unwarranted interference by the Russians in Persia’s internal affairs. He said that this interference was completely at variance with the spirit of the charter, the same charter which only a few days previously had been signed by representatives of the Soviet Government. Taking stock of the prevention of the despatch of gendarmerie reinforcements to the north, the prevention of the flight of Persian aircraft over Persian soil, and the Soviet refusal to allow Persian vehicles and arms taken from Persian rebels by Persian officials to be transported to Tehran, the natural reaction w r as to ask whether all the sacrifices which had been made during the past few years had been made in vain. The three great leaders who had signed the Tehran Declaration had borne witness to the inestimable services Persia had rendered Russia in the darkest days of the war, services which had been performed in good heart and good faith because of the certainty that they would help in laying low every form of dictatorship and tyranny. Persians were sure that the Soviet Government could not be aware of the behaviour of their officials in the northern provinces of Persia because it did not make sense that such behaviour should be countenanced by the Govern ment whose leader had always stood in opposition to the use of force. Persia, the Bridge of Victory, Persia, the country which had played the greatest of roles in the achievement of final victory, had found nothing in the Bridge of Victory, hailed with joy by the Russians, except misery and despair. Persia and the Persians expected the Soviet Government and her other neighbours to evacuate the country within six months in accordance with the terms of the Tripartite Pact; that this expectation would indeed be fulfilled was certain for the Persians were confident of the friendship and sense of justice of the Russian Government. To Persia there was no difference between Great Britain, the United States or the Soviet Union; those who chose to respect Persia’s rights would be held dear in the heart of every Persian, but any attempt to ride rough shod over Persian sovereignty would be odious in the extreme. Friendship with all three of her great Allies was desired by Persia but no breach of international law would be tolerated. Other business at the same session included the approval by a unanimous decision of the United Nations Charter and a bitter attack by Ali Dashti on the minority whose behaviour he compared with that of sulky children Deputy [69—139]Tusi, making himself heard with difficulty over the increasing din, accused Dashti of being a spy in the pay of a foreign Power. After this pandemonium broke loose and Dashti was with some difficulty rescued by his supporters from violence at the hands of his opponents and safely removed from the Chamber. At the session of the 6th September Dr. Musaddiq asked for time in which to explain the recent tactics of the minority group. This was refused. 1 he Minister for Foreign Affairs then made a long speech on Persia’s foreign policy. 1 he 2/12ths budget bill was then sent to commission for amendments. 2. Most educated Persians are pinning their hopes on a favourable state ment on the evacuation of Persia from the Foreign Secretaries Conference now in session in London. They feel that in this lies their only hope of saving the northern provinces from being incorporated in the U.S.S.R. and of preventing further Russian interference in their internal affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is believed to have demanded permission for the Persian Ambassador in London to attend the relevant discussions, hoping thereby that Persia’s case may be represented more strongly and that more publicity will be achieved for Persia’s present plight. The Persian Army. 3. The Ministry for War has under consideration a scheme for bettering the financial condition of Persian army officers. H.I.M. the Shah, at an audience which he granted to the British military attache on the 3rd September, informed him that the following benefits were to be granted :— (i) An increment of pay for every year of service. (ii) A free issue of summer and winter uniforms. (iii) A children’s allowance. (iv) Free housing in officers’ quarters to be built in the vicinity of barracks. (v) The establishment of a co-operative society. The B.M.A. took the opportunity to represent to H.I.M. that discontented officers, or officers rendered desperate by financial difficulties, were a menace to any army, that paper promises were insufficient, that the houses would take several years to complete, and that much opposition to the scheme might be expected in the Majlis who would probably insist on similar benefits and concessions for civilian employees of Government. 4. There is little further news of the recent mutiny. One more officer, a conscription official at Shahrud deserted but was captured. Two junior officers in Meshed, whose complicity has been suspected, shot themselves There is growing discontent at the manner in which officers’ antecedents and contacts have been investigated and much criticism is being directed against General Arfa, the Chief of the General Staff, for arresting officers on insufficient evidence or on the false testimony of interested persons. Communications. 5. The maintenance of the Zahidan-Meshed road is being handed back by G.H.Q., India, to the Persian Government. The hand over is to be by sections and is to begin on the 21st September. Internal Security. Pars. 6. The General Staff claim to have collected 115 and 128 rifles respectively from the rival factions of the Haiyat Daudis and Lirawis. Some confusion occurred when columns despatched by the Pars and Khuzistan Divisions arrived simultaneously on the scene claiming that the other had no jurisdiction. Azerbaijan. 7. The arrival in Tabriz of the military commission of enquiry (see paragraph 13 of Intelligence Summary No. 33) was the occasion for the issue of a manifesto by “ the people of Tabriz ” appealing for protection against Tudeh oppression. The notices were at once torn down by the Tudeh. The situation in Maragheh is unchanged with the Persian army garrison incarcerated in its own barracks by Russian troops. The municipal accountant is reported to have been beaten to death by the Tudeh. There is some talk of the formation of a new Democratic party in opposition to the Tudeh, but well-informed sources consider this to be merely an electioneering stunt to disarm the general odium and suspicion attaching to the Tudeh on account of its identification with the3 pWHrvna’ candidates of the Democratic party at the forthcoming p • s W1 , / Je f°p nc J to be the same Tudeh members in new guise or, as the lan won d put it, the same donkey with a new packsaddle/ ’ Gilan and Mazanderan. i ' le Russians nave now given permission for the Persian army to remove e \eJncies, arms and ammunition captured from the mutineers at Gunbad-i- t^abus. they have refused, however, to allow any escort to accompany the ve icles. As the road is known to be infested with armed Turcomans and as the remaining mutineers are still at large in the neighbourhood this permission is not ot much practical value. Armed Turcomans with Tudeh armlets now patrol the q t, 1 n ^ s f atl0ns ^ Bandar-i-Gaz and Shahi. The situation at Chalus. Sari, Shahi and Babul is reported to be quieter as resistance to the Tudeh has ceased and the civil administration is virtually in their hands. Isfahan. 9. A consular report discloses an interesting situation in the district of Fereidan where the villages are, for the most part, owned by numerous small holders and where the chief elements are Armenians, a colony of Georgians and two rival factions of Chahar Lang, Bakhtiaries. The Armenians are frequently visited by a Father Joachim from the Armenian church at Julfa. This priest is in close touch with the Soviet Consulate-General and has recently preached an anti-conscription campaign. The Georgians, as might be expected, are also in close touch with the Soviet Consulate-General. Murteza Quli Khan has had some difficulty in keeping the peace in this potentially troublesome area. A f'pointments — civil. 10.—(i) Hussain Pasha Nawai to be Persian Consul-General at Herat; (ii) Hussain Ala has left to take up his post as Persian Ambassador at Washington.

Political. 1. The Majlis. —On the 9th September the Minister of Finance tabled a Bill to revise Dr. Millspaugh’s income tax law of November 1943. Deputy Ardelams proposal that in future foreign nationals should only be engaged after sanction by the Majlis was approved by a large majority. On the 11th September the Minister of Finance tabled a single-article Bill to ratify the 1925 Geneva Con vention regarding the export of opium. (The arrival of Persian opium at American ports has recently been the subject of a complaint by the United States Government.) On the same day the Minister for War tabled a Bill asking for provision for two additional divisions for the army of a strength of 12,000 men at a cost of 165 million rials; for a credit of 35 million rials for financial benefits and concessions to army officers (see paragraph 3 of last Intelligence Summary), and for a credit of 3 million dollars for purchase of military equipment from the United States. The Bill was subsequently approved by the Majlis Budget Commission, but is likely to meet with a stormy passage through the Majlis, when the Tudeh members, acting on Russian instructions, will certainly oppose any measures calculated either to strengthen or improve Persia’s armed forces. At the same session Dr. Musaddiq made one of his typically turbid and turgid orations. He described the tactics of the minority, prescribed the ideal form of government in Persia, recommended an ideal form of foreign policy, gave a long historical sketch of Persia’s relations with Russia and Great Britain, made a long indictment against Reza Shah, and finally attempted to justify his own acts and opinions on any and every occasion in the past. On the 13th September the session was taken up with personal attacks and counter-attacks, the chief bouts being between Tussi and Ali Dashti, and between the Armenian Deputy Hovanessian and Siqqat-ul-Islam. The Minister for War also intervened to defend the General Officer Commanding, Tabriz, from slanderous attacks by Hovanessian. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has addressed a note to the British, Russian and American Embassies, in which he stated that the surrender of Japan on the 2nd September, 1945, had given the greatest satisfaction to the Persian Government and congratulated the Allies on this final victory. He also stated that his note dated the 19th May, 1945, on the occasion of Germany’s surrender had remained unanswered. In that note his Government had requested the evacuation of Persia by the Allies, so that Persia could regain her normal status. The Minister for Foreign Affairs then stated that, according to the Tripartite Treaty, the period of six months’ delay after the cessation of hostilities in which the Allies had undertaken to evacuate Persia would be calculated from the 2nd September, 1945, and that his Government expects that, according to clause 5 of that treaty, not a single Allied sailor, soldier or airman shall remain on Persian soil after the 2nd March, 1946. He added that evacuation before that date would be of the greatest service to Persia. 3. Despite the Military Governor’s ban on political meetings in Tehran some forty members of the Tudeh party attempted to hold a meeting in the party’s headquarters on the 14th September. Most of the Tudeh Deputies were there. A police officer, who had been sent to order the meeting to disperse, was dragged inside the building, beaten by a Tudeh Deputy, and had his epaulettes torn off. The military governor, on hearing of the incident, stated that he could not arrest the Deputy on account of his parliamentary immunity. [69—138]I Internal Security. Khorasan. , ^ , 4. A Meshed Tudeh paper has published a copy of the manrfesto posted on the walls of Gunbad-i-Qabus by Lieut.-Colonel Niwai, the s , en “ r f fi t cel j® 1 ^ Meshed group of mutineers. It calls upon the Turcomans and others to i.e , overthrow the present Persian Government. fnrthmmino- ' 5. The Tudeh party are making active preparations for the toithcomin 0 elections Both they and the Russians are reported to be bringing pressure to bear on the Governor-General, Ali Mansur, to ensure that the largest possible number of Tudeh Deputies are returned from Khorasan. . p , , 6. Colonel Hatemi has been appointed provincial chief of police mce Colonel Turaj Amin. The latter has been frequently reported from consular sources to )e a tool of the Russians. 7. The General Staff has announced that, as the result of operations in Kurdistan up to the 2nd September, 1,343 rifles have been collected. his ngure, in the light of events and the balance of casualties m the recent operations, is undoubtedly exaggerated, and 500 would be a better estimate. Of these, tew have been taken from the Kurds opposing the army but from semi-settled tribes, to whom previous commanders had issued these arms for their protection. Azarbaijan. 8. The Chief of the General Staff informed the British Military Attache that according to a report received from the General Officer Commanding, labuz, a Russian consular officer and the Russian down Major of Miandoab, by name Namazaliof, recently visited Ghazi Muhammad at Mahabad and asked him to send a force to aid Mulla Mustafa of Barzan in his operations against the Iraqi army Ghazi Muhammad showed the Russians a letter to the same effect which he himself had received from Mulla Mustafa. Ghazi Muhammad is reported by the same source as having been non-committal in his reply and to have laid down as a necessary condition for his armed support the crying off by the Russians ot all Tudeh activity in his area as inimical to the activities of the Kornala, m which alone he was interested. According to the same source the Russians, subsequently, contacted some Mangur and Herki chieftains with the same request. The Mangur pleaded inabilitv to come to Mulla Mustafa s aid on account of then fear of retaliation by the Pushtdar tribe, with whom they were on bad terms. The Herki also showed little enthusiasm for this venture, as they feared punitive action by the Iraqi Government on that portion of their tribe residing within Iraqi territory and made the condition that they should be joined by the Debukri Kurds. 9. According to a consular report unconfirmed by the General Staff, the Persian army detachment at Maraghah has been disarmed by the Russian garrison there and is now allowed to leave its barracks (see paragraph 7 of last Intelligence Summary). 10. ^ A consular source reports that, following a skirmish between Zero Agha’s men and the gendarmerie near Balanej bridge near Rezaieh, in which two gendarmes were killed, a force of seventy gendarmes was despatched from Rezaieh to attack the Kurds. The Russians stopped this force and disarmed it, sending back the arms to the Officer Commanding, Persian garrison at Rezaieh. The Russians claimed that they had acted in good faith, having mistaken the gendarmes for bandits. 11. No visible result has come from the visit to Tabriz of the recent military commission under General Jahanbani. There are no signs of a Russian with drawal from Tabriz, where they are, in fact, acquiring additional houses, possibly to accommodate troops to be withdrawn from Tehran. A general tightening up of check post control has also been noticed. Bakhtiari and Luristan. 12. After three years of continued pressure by His Majesty’s Embassy the Persian Government announce that they have effected the arrest of Haidar s/o Baqir, Barani s/o Ali and Seyyid Murad s/o Shah Murad all of Feraidan in Bakhtiari who were responsible for the murder in 1942 of Mr. Harris, British Vice-Consul at Isfahan, and of Dr. Griffiths of the Church Missionary Society, and of his small son, and, subsequently, fled to the mountains between Bakhtiaria.nd Luristan. I he arrested men are to be brought to Tehran and tried by a military court. The Court. 13. 1 he prolonged absence of Queen Fawzieh in Egypt had given rise to rumours of an impending Royal divorce. On the 12th September most of the Persian papers published a communique from the Persian Embassy in Cairo announcing that rumours of a divorce between the Shah and Queen Fawzieh are completely without foundation and that the Queen is merely passing the summer months in Egypt. Economic. 14. In order to make good economic losses caused by the war the Finance Ministry is to draw up an economic programme covering trade relations with Great Britain, United States, U.S.S.R., Turkey and India. Dr. Ali Amini has been appointed to go to India to examine the possibilities of Persian exports to India and imports thence. Dr. Ali Amini (F.O. 15-M.A. 19) is a brother-in-law of Dr. Imami who has been in India for more than a year on a purchasing commission. Education. 15. The Persian Government has accepted the invitation issued by His Majesty’s Government and the French Government to send a delegation to the forthcoming International Educational Conference in London. The Persian delegation will consist of Ali Asghar Hikmat (who headed last year’s Persian cultural mission to India), Dr. Raadi, Director-General in the Ministry of Educa tion, Dr. Ghulam Hussein Sadiqi, Director-General of the Secretariat of Tehran University, and Dr. Isa Sipah. a professor at Tehran University. American Interests. 16. Two parties of American Congressmen arrived in Tehran on the 10th September. One party came from Moscow and the other from Syria. They left by air for Saudi Arabia on the 13th September. Yugoslav Interests. 17. Asim Ali Hadzic, the newly-appointed Yugoslav Minister, has arrived and has presented his letters of credence to His Imperial Majesty the Shah. Russian Interests. 18. The Russian Ambassador is still absent. The Russian military attache is also absent on leave. 19. Lorries containing stores and troops have been seen leaving Tehran for the west and a new camp on the western outskirts of Kazvin has been noticed. The information so far received has not been sufficient to enable a calculation to be made as to the numbers of Russian troops which have left and which still remain in the capital. 20. During the past three weeks the Soviet consular authorities have been making difficulties over the granting of passes for British civil and military officials to visit places on the Caspian littoral. Polish Interests. 21. The number of Poles in Persia as at the 14th September, 1945, is as follows :— Location. Men. Women. Children. Total. Tehran 352 1,103 295 1,750 Isfahan ... 69 410 394 873 Ahwaz ... 151 689 279 1,119 In addition there are 812 Poles living in Tehran in employment or privately who are not the responsibility of the Polish Refugee organisation. The Poles in Isfahan are being transferred in batches to the Lebanon and a certain number of the Poles in Tehran are being transferred to Ahwaz. No other moves inside or outside Persia are at present contemplated.The future attitude of the Warsaw Government will determine largely the question of future moves either by way of a return to Poland or moves further afield. Persian Army. 22. Though there is little further information about the recent mutiny it would be premature to consider it as entirely stamped out. During last week one more officer absented himself from Tehran under suspicious circumstances, but returned to duty after three days. Those officers who, as the result of the findings of the commission referred to in paragraph 6 of Intelligence Summary No. 34. are to be kept under arrest until the state of emergency comes to an end, are to be transferred to Kerman. 23. The addition of two new divisions to the Persian army, the provision of financial benefits to officers and the demand for a $3 million credit for pur chase of equipment are referred to in paragraph 1 above./HE \JNJ)E R S CCR IT Irthy or- 5//?/ £ 'TV&gt;//^ or'p/c THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT £vrr |m-^ PERSIA.

Persian Affairs. The Majlis. 1. No business of any importance has been done during the past week. At the session of the 16th September the debate on the Two-Twelfths Budget Bill was resumed but was not concluded. On the 18th September there was no public session as the Prime Minister had asked the Speaker to convene a special joint meeting of the Majlis Budget and Foreign Affairs Commissions to discuss ways and means for the transference of American military assets in Peisia to the Persian Government. Representatives of the Ministries for Foreign Affairs, Roads and Communications and Finance also attended this meeting. On the 19th September the Majlis met but rose on account of there being no quorum. On the 20th September the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement in amplification of his recent note to the British, Russian and American Embassies on the subject of the evacuation of Persia by Allied troops (see paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summarv). In replv to criticism of his note he explained that, in giving the 2nd March, 1946, as the date by which the evacuation of Persia must be completed, he wished to establish that date as legally collect. His Government did not wish to convey the impression that they were willing to see the Allied occupation of Persia continue up to that date. On the contrary, the Persian Government regarded it as an essential preliminary to the return to normality that the evacuation should be begun as speedily as possible and concluded, if possible, before that date. Political. 2. There is some evidence to show that the Majlis majority does not intend to keep Sadr in office indefinitely but that it is wise enough to realise that a change of premiership during the present crisis would be a very dangerous step. The name of Hakim-ul-Mulk is again being mentioned as a possible successor to Sadr. 3. Growing anxiety is felt in political and ministerial circles at the lack of news from London about the decisions taken at the Foreign Secretaries Conference in respect of the evacuation of Persia by Allied troops. The Persians, dilatory in expediting other people’s business, invariably give the highest priority to their own and cannot understand why their own particular problem was not put down as No. 1 on the agenda. A telegram, alleged to have been sent by the Persian Ambassador in London, to the effect that the London press, in publishing the agenda of the conference, had made no mention of Persia, contributed to the general feeling of suspense. More recently a message from Reuters alluding to a rumour current in London that the Russians might possibly ask for the separation of Azerbaijan from Persia has added to this consternation. The Tudeh. 4. The stock of the Tudeh party in Tehran has slumped during the past week. The reasons are :— (i) The closing of the Tudeh party offices by the Military Governor; (ii) the suppression of some of the Tudeh papers; (iii) the injuries sustained in a scuffle with the military by Dr. Kishawarz, the Tudeh leader; (iv) the communique issued by the Chief of the General Staff on the recent mutiny in the Persian army in which Tudeh complicity is made amply clear; [70—103] B2 \ (y) the evacuation of Tehran by Soviet troops by which the Tudeh realise that Russian armed assistance will be no longer available to save them from the consequences of their acts of hooliganism. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 5. Increased activity is being shown by the newly-formed Democratic party (see Intelligence Summary No. 35, paragraph 7) and by the Russians in giving open support to it. It has revealed its true colours and origin by its insistence on provincial autonomy for Azerbaijan. Nobody is likely to be deceived by this and everybody will realise that from provincial autonomy through separation from Persia to inclusion in the U.S.S.R. is but a short step. The Azerbaijan fudeh party has announced the severance of ties with the central Tudeh party in Tehran and of its adherence to the Azerbaijan Democratic party. Isfahan and Kuhigalu. 6. The General Officer Commanding, Isfahan Division, has despatched an infantry battalion to Fereidan to assist in disarming some of the Chahar Lano- Bakhtiari khans. ° ^: General Humayuni, who has recently relinquished the command of the Khuzistan Division on being appointed to Kurdistan, gives a version differino 1 widely from that of Murteza Quli Khan on the recent raids by Bahmai and eyy 1 tribesmen on Murteza Quli Khan’s domains near Deh Diz (see Intelligence {Summary ISjO. 34, paragraph 5). The general states that the raiders did not ^t^u 3 ^ 0 , 111 ? nmh , eT and that Murteza Quli Khan’s own bakshdar at Izeh, one All Khahh, though supplied with 150 rifles by the State to maintain order made no attempt to do so nor in fact reported the raid to any Government authority. Kurdistan. 8. A delicate situation is likely to arise if the General Officer Commandin°\ Kurdistan Division, carries out the orders recently given him by the Chief of the lieneiai Stan. The latter, anxious to achieve a decisive victory and conclude these operations before winter sets in or other commitments arise, and impatient at the lack of success by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in securing Iraqi co operation in dosing the frontier to Kurds attempting to flee before the advancing Persian army columns, has ordered the General Officer Commanding to pursue the Kurds if necessary across the frontier and continue his disarmament operations inside Iraqi territory. Persian army. 9. A short summary of a communique on the recent events in Khorasan and rhliflrA ‘r- he P^fan army which was given to the Persian press by the Chief of the General Staff is published as Appendix B to this summary.

Representatives for the northern and3 (xi) southern factories and one representative for the workers are to be appointed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and it is also probable that a Ministry of Finance representative will attend the conference. Dr. Hisam-ud-din-Ihtisham is also one of the delegates; General Muhammad Hussein Firuz, late Governor-General of Fars, to be an Inspector-General of Military District No. 5 (Kurdistan). British Interests. 11. A note by the commercial secretary of this embassy on the present position regarding the disposal of British military assets in Persia is attached as Appendix A to this summary. 12. His Majesty’s Embassy have communicated to the Soviet Embassy and the Persian Government the programme for the evacuation of Tehran by the British military forces. It is as follows :— (i) By the 2nd October all British army units will be clear of Tehran except for small rear parties. By the same date the Royal Air Force will have withdrawn from Tehran except for a rear party of approximately 86 British officers and men and 60 Royal Air Force Levies who will be located in the camp at Mehrabad; (ii) By the 15th October these army and Royal Air Force rear parties will also have left and the only British troops remaining in Tehran will be those employed in liquidation of assets, disposal of claims, &amp;c., as per list below :— Hirings, Disposal and Claims Transportation Finance Department of Movements Administration Officer Signals Department ... Middle East Supply Centre ... British Embassy—Representative for Polish Refugees Royal Engineers Stores Organisation (Sawmill) Public Relations Bureau Officers. 6 3 1 1 11 1 British other ranks. 5 5 1 1 11 7 3 6 23 39 (iii) A survey party engaged by the Persian Government to survey the area connected with the Ear irrigation project will also be working south of Tehran till the 30th November. Their numbers are as follows :— 5 officers and 100 British other ranks. (iv) The Royal Air Force propose to retain their rights under the protocol of the 30th June, 1942, in respect of Qaleh Murgheh airfield until the Soviet forces are withdrawn from the airfield and adjacent buildings. It is not intended to keep any Royal Air Force personnel in Tehran In this connexion. The above information has also been given to the American Military Attache and the Persian Chief of the General Staff. Russian Interests. 13. The Soviet Ambassador has returned to Tehran. 14. The Russians withdrew their troops from Qaleh Murgheh aerodrome during the night of the 18th-19th September. Some twenty-five Intourist per sonnel have remained to operate the Russian military air services to Tabriz, Meshed and Moscow. The Soviet Ambassador informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 20th September that Soviet troops had evacuated Tehran and its environs and Qaleh Murgheh aerodrome and that Soviet censorship had been removed. In reply to a question by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Ambassador stated that the troops evacuated from Tehran would return direct to the U.S.S.R. [70—103] b 24 Polish Interests. 15. Ihe new Polish Charge d’Affaires, M. Eugene Melnitsky, has taken over the Polish Legation on behalf of the Warsaw Government from the Persian Ministry for koreign Affairs. His predecessor, owing allegiance to the Polish Government in London, had refused to hand over to M. Melnitsky. Tehran, 23rd September, 1945. M. Appendix A. Disposal of Assets — Persia. 1. Railways. (i) The present position as regards British assets is that an impasse has been reached. I he Persian Ministry of Communications stand by the draft agree ment made in 1942, by which all fixed assets should revert to them free of charge. Unfortunately, the draft agreement was never ratified and, although the British representative on the transportation Committee defined what he conceived to be fixed assets, i.e., only the actual buildings, there is no record that any agreement on this point was reached with the Persians. The result is that the Persian Railway Commission have so far declined to discuss prices unless it is conceded that fixed assets should revert to them free of charge. It is hoped that the position will be clarified in a few days’ time. (ii) The Americans have also reached a deadlock. They offered their loco motives, freight wagons and oil-tank wagons for sale, but failed to receive any firm offer from the Persian authorities. They have accordingly instructed the P.S.R. to remove all their rolling-stock south for shipment elsewhere. The American locomotives could, at a pinch, be replaced by British locomotives, but these are of a small type and unsuitable for Persia. Also, British freight wagons are open-sided, whereas box-cars are needed. The most serious aspect of this matter is, however, the withdrawal of the oil-tank wagons. The Persians them selves possess only 303, and to maintain adequate oil distribution a minimum of 580 and a maximum of 716 are needed. The withdrawal of the American oil-tank wagons would lead to a total breakdown in oil distribution this winter. Repre sentations have been made to London and Washington, asking the Americans to reconsider their attitude. (iii) The Persian Government have claimed from the British militarv authorities (but not from His Majesty’s Embassy) the sum of £7 700 000 in respect of freights in excess of the £16,500,000 which has already been paid since 1942 to keep the railways running. They are likely also to lodge an additional claim in respect of passenger traffic. The Persian Government are not making the question of purchase of railway assets contingent on the settlement of their claim for excess freights. What they have done so far is to decline to discuss the question of purchase of what they conceive to be fixed assets. 2. Telecommunications. The Persian Government want to buy the entire pole and line system, includ ing the American section, representing some 31 per cent. The latter is, however, not for sale. They also want to buy the entire carrier installations. The British Military Disposals Board asked an over-all price of £400,000, and the Persians offered £200,000. A final offer of £300,000 was then made, and they were informed that, unless they accept it by 1 o’clock on the 23rd September, the British military will dismantle the pole and line system and ship the carrier system out of the country. 3. Other Pieced Assets. The disposal of camps, cinemas, &amp;c., in the North Persia area is proceeding normally. Satisfactory offers have been received for all installations offered for sale by public adjudication. Prices realised have been quite satisfactory. An agreement with the Persian Government has been reached about the payment of customs duty and a claim from the Ministry of Finance for the payment of sales tax has been rejected, as this tax is payable by the seller, and the British conten tion is that one Government cannot levy taxes against another Government. 4.

Under Jer Secretary of Stats for Foreign Affairs [E 7839/70/34] Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 38, Secret, for the 'period 2A:th to 30£A September, 1945 .—(Communicated in Tehran despatch No. 346 of 1st October; Received in Foreign Office ISth October) Persian Affairs. The Majlis. 1. At the session of the 25th September Dr. Kishawarz, with his head suitably swathed in bandages, described the injuries which he had sustained in his scuffle with the military. He gave his interpretation of parliamentary immunity, attacked the Chief of the General Staff for having an English mother and an English wife, complained that no less than thirty-six newspapers had been suppressed, and wound up by saying that, in oppression and harshness, the present military governorship in Tehran was just as bad as the tyrannical dictatorship of Reza Khan \_sic~\. On the 26th September the Prime Minister asked for a vote of confidence, but the Tudeh members and the minority walked out leaving no quorum. The majority members persuaded them to return as the minority leader, Dr. Musaddiq, was to speak. The two-twelfths budget bill was then passed. The session of the 27th September was remarkable for a fine speech by the Deputy Panahi, who ridiculed the idea of there being any genuine separatist movement in Azerbaijan. Exposing the real nature of the Azerbaijan Democratic party’s programme, he said they were democrats in nothing but name. The freedom they claimed w T as merely freedom to oppress, rob and murder their political opponents. He admitted that reforms in Persia were long overdue, but said that they could not be affected by terrorism. 1 wo other Deputies, Reza Hikmat (Sardar Fakhir) and Misbah Fatemi, spoke on much the same lines and described the high-handed acts now* being perpetrated by the Tudeh in Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazanderan, Khorasan and, more recently, in Zenjan. Dr. Musaddiq pushed his long nose into the debate and got it punched for his pains by the Minister of Finance who accused him of untruthfulness. This affront to his dignity caused the doctor to burst into one of his customary fits of sobbing. Accurately sensing the temper of the House, the Government seized the opportunity to ask for a vote of confidence, which it secured by seventy votes against forty, there being four abstentions. Thus ends the first round of the fight betwen the Government and the Opposition which began as long ago as the 17th July. Internal Affairs. 2. 1 he Ministry of Justice is to set up a commission to hear complaints by the Tudeh party against the Military Governorship and complaints by that body and by individuals against the Tudeh. 3. The Government has announced that any of its nationals who have sustained damage at the hands of the Axis Powers should state their claims to the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. 4. The Ministry of Roads and Communications is reported in the press as having asked the Soviet Embassy to begin discussions for the handing back of the northern sections of the Iranian State Railway, i.e., Tehran-Bandar Shah Tehran-Mianeh and Tehran-Shahrud. No mention was made of the section Tabriz-Julfa. 5. The sub-governate (bakshdari) of Qasr-i-Shirin is to be raised to the status of a governate (farandari). 6. A disastrous fire broke out on the 24th September in the bazaar quarter of Kazvin and over 600 shops are said to have been destroyed, 7. A riot occurred in Zenjan on the 28th September between the Tudeh and their opponents. The Governor was seriously wounded when attemptino- to calm the crowd. ' i &amp; [70—144]2 Internal Security. Kurdistan. 8. According to consular sources the operations in Kurdistan are not going so well as the General Staff would have the public believe. General Hushmand Afshar’s road turns out to be but a fair weather track roughly completed only as far as Rezab. The Persian forces have not yet succeeded in capturing Dizli and there is little prospect of any result being achieved before winter sets in. General Humayuni, the newly-appointed commander of the Senneh Division, is far from enthusiastic about his task. He stated to the British Military Attache that, as far as he could see, there was no objective the gaining of which would achieve any finality. As for disarmament, that was only possible if the Kurds stayed to be disarmed, whereas at this moment there were no Kurds within striking distance of the Persian army columns as they had either fled across the Iraqi border or had split into small parties in the inaccessible mountains. Winter would force the Persian army to fall back to its permanent garrisons before it forced the Kurds to return to their villages. General Humayuni gave the infantry strength of the forces now deployed as, Saqqiz one battalion, Banch two battalions, Merivan two battalions, Avroman nine battalions, Sardasht one battalion and one battalion on the L. of C. near the Garan Pass. He hinted that a mixed commission with representatives of other ministries might visit the area soon and try to effect a settlement. Khorasan. 9. No very recent news of the mutiny has been received. A party of 100 gendarmes proceeding from Bujnurd to Gunbad-i-Qabus to round up' Colonel Nawai’s band of mutineers was turned back by the Russians. Ali Mansur, the Governor-General, has arrived in Tehran. In Meshed it is thought that he will not return. C ommunications. 10. Neither in the recent discussions about the disposal of British military assets nor in the previous negotiations regarding the handing back of the I.S. Railway to the Persian Government for operation was any mention made of the Zahidan—Mirjawa section of the Indian N.W\ Railway. The reason, probably, was that neither the construction nor the operation of this line had put the Persian Government to any expense. It is, however, a matter which must come up for discussion before the expiry of the treaty period. Appointments. 11- ‘(i) Saifullah Nawab to be Governor-General of Mazanderan; (n) Naukhuda III (Lieut.-Commander) Sultan Muhammad Ardelan to be Assistant Military [sic] Attache at Washington; (iii) Sartip Ibrahim Muizzi to be Commander Khwash Brigade; (iv) Sarhang Azizi to be General Officer Commanding 7th Kerman Division vice Sartip Sha’ri recalled; (v) Sartip Ghulam Hussein Naqdi (Judge Advocate-General) is placed en dispombihte; r (vi) Musa Nuri Isfandiari, Muwaffaq-us-Saltaneh (F.O. 100) to be Persian Ambassador in Angora; (vii) The appointment of Mehdi Farrukh, Mutasam-us-Salteneh (F O 61 M.A. 85) as Governor-General of Eastern Azerbaijan had been announced in'thc press some weeks previously. The appointment would now appear to have been confirmed as a press report states that the Cabinet have agreed to the demand c e j b I k armkh aS a “ndition of his acceptance of the post. These demand' included the provision of funds for the extension of the railway from Mimeh to Tabriz and for road construction. He also secured the Cabinet’s annroval of the appointment of his nominee Muhammad Wali Nuban as Deputy Governor General and Governor of Tabriz. J T 12.

Appendix. Extract from Press. (Single Article Bill tabled by the Minister of War on the 11th September, 1945, for the formation of two new Army Divisions.) The following is the text of the Single Article Bill tabled by the Minister of War on the 11th September for the formation of two new army divisions. (Note : This Bill has not yet become law) :— Article 1. The Majlis shall authorise the Government to provide the following credits in addition to the present budget of the Ministry of War and to pay such credits to that Ministry :— {a) 165 million rials for the addition of two divisions (numbering 12,132 men) to the present army organisation, for which a budget of 165 million rials has been estimated, payment of the budget for the last six months of the year to be made gradually as the organisa tion of the two divisions by the Ministry of War proceeds. (b) An estimated sum of 35 million rials to be paid annually by the Ministry of Finance for the improvement of the living conditions of officers in respect of child allowances, difference in the cost of living atI 4 different posts, increase in pay for years of service, and the grant of two suits of service clothing each year. (c) The credit to cover the above expenditure, amounting to 100 million rials for the last six months of the year, will be paid to the Ministry of War gradually as required; should the State revenue for 1324 not be sufficient to cover this additional expenditure, the Government shall be authorised to borrow the same from the National Bank, andS^ to provide for its refund in the following years’ budgets. A rticle 2. Up to 3 million dollars credit shall be approved for the provision of military equipment and supplies for the year 1324, and the Ministry of War shall be authorised to place orders with the United States for the purchase of ♦ the equipment within the limit of this credit, and to pay for them after delivery; the credit for these purchases amounting to the above figure shall be provided in rials in the Ministry of War’s budget for 1324./ f 777o /3 1/3 ^ 1 '* &lt; v' V\LE copy Ho.379 (786/6/45). ,&lt;0 I m F S£c/Zi- iff&amp;V c/^ Sift//? ftefc 6211 — j.M'bin or-ncft 24 4 NpV 194 % ■■ ^ f a'Representative at Tehran presents his compliments to Kis Majesty^ Principal ^7/ic Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to enclose the under-mentioned documents.

No. 307 Date: 11th October, 1945 Now that the war is over, I suggest that His Majesty^ Consulates could revert to sending their consular diaries monthly instead of fortnightly. 2. A further reason is that staffs are being reduced in some Consulates; a fortnightly diary will thus be more of a burden and will hinder the Consul from touring his district. Again, most consular bag services will almost certainly be reduced to a frequency of less than once a fortnight, so that fortnightly diaries would bo waste of time. 3. Consular diaries, whether monthly or fortnightly, do not of course exempt the Consul from reporting interesting events as they occur, and in any case Consuls at the important posts send telegraphic situation reports every week. 4.

Persian Affairs. The Majlis. 1. No public session was held on the 30th September as the Prime Minister had asked the Speaker to call a secret session to discuss the purchase of American surplus military assets in Persia. The Minister of Finance explained why the Government could not maintain its contention that all American assets should e handed over to the Persian Government free of charge and that the Government had decided to purchase those assets of which it stood in need. The House agreed on condition that the Persian Government should not be forced to pay in doliaTS for assets which they did not require or for those assets which were sold m the open market. For these the purchasers and not the National Bank must provide the dollars. At the session of the 2nd October the Minister of War asked for discussion of his Bill for the provision of two additional divisions. (See Intel ligence Summary No. 38, paragraph 12.) The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement regarding the purchase of American military assets and also gave the reasons for the non-conclusion of a treaty governing the entry of American troops into Persia. Dr. Musaddiq also spoke, repeating his assertion that Sadr had undertaken to resign should the Opposition to his Government reach the figure o forty The Prime Minister denied ever having given any such undertaking. There was no public session on the 4th October, but a number of Deputies said to be as many as eighty, prepared the draft of a Bill to postpone the next elections till at the latest, one month after the evacuation of Persia by Allied troops. A new Electoral Law is also to be passed which will result in the new elections being concluded in a much shorter time than hitherto. (The Government s proclamation about the new elections should normally have been issued on the 16th September.) At the session of the 6th October Dr. Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai was re-elected President of the Majlis by 64 votes against 47 cast for Ali Dashti. At the session of the 7th October Malek Madani and Amir Teymour were elected vice-presidents. Political. 2. The Prime Minister is reliably reported as having announced his inten tion of resigning at an audience with H.I.M. The Shah. He said that, notwith standing the vote of confidence which his Government had secured, the continued attacks made on him and his Cabinet by Dr Musaddiq and the minority had made continuance of his task impossible. The Shah is reported to have asked Sadr to continue in office a little longer. . . , „ „ 3 Persian anxiety about the outcome of the Foreign Secretaries Conference in London seems to have diminished slightly. The more sensible realise that, disappointing as the Russian attitude to immediate evacuation was the existence of a treaty containing a fixed date for this evacuation does afford a reasonable hope of liberation within five months from the present Russian stranglehold on the four northern provinces of Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazanderan, and Khorasan. Internal Security. Kurdistan. 4 Seven members of the Komala (Kurdish Autonomy party) visited Baku between the 17th and 23rd September at the invitation of the Soviet Government. They were headed by Ghazi Muhammad of Mahabad. According to the press, the Persian Government, incensed at this visit without their permission and even without the obtaining of exit visas by the party, have protested to the Soviet Embassy and even demanded the extradition of the seven Kurds.Pars. 5. The downward migration of the Qashgai and Khamseh tribes is well under way and no acts of brigandage have been reported as yet. This year 500 additional families of Darrashuri have remained behind in the summer quarters, making 1,000 families in all. These are divided into fifteen settlements. Persian Air Force. 6. Doshan Tappeh airfield and the aircraft factory were handed back to the Persian Air Force by the R.A.F. on the 1st October. Persian Army. 7. H.I.M. The Shah is reported to be greatly relieved at the fizzling out of the recent mutiny. Not everyone would agree, however, that the trouble is com pletely over. As is usual with Persians, treatment for a disease tends to stop when the malady passes from the acute to the chronic stage. In this case, the root cause of the mutiny was the appalling financial conditions under which officers have to serve, though it cannot be denied that the Tudeh party fanned the flames of discontent with their propaganda. If the recent promises for the financial relief of officers are not implemented it can safely be predicted that the trouble will break out again. Civil Aviation. 8. The Americans are pressing the Persian Government to give an American commercial air line operating rights to Tehran, and appear to have suggested that the existing American military service might be continued meanwhile to keep the route open. The Persian Government attitude is understood to be that, as long as any foreign troops remain anywhere in Persia, they will give no such rights to any foreigner. They obviously fear that, if they admit the Americans, they will be unable to resist similar or more extensive demands from the Russians. Persians generally are realising the inconveniences which they will suffer from the lack of adequate air communications with the outside world, which they are not yet in a position to provide from their own resources, and this realisation, coupled with a typical desire to please the Americans, from whom they expect material benefits, may make it difficult for the Government to maintain their attitude indefinitely. It is expected that the Persian Government will grant limited rights to the Americans within the next few days. At the Chicago Conference the Persian delegates followed the British lead, which was opposed to the grant of “Fifth Freedom” rights such as the Americans are now demanding. 9. The Persian Government have requested that a small party of R.A.F. be left in Persia to supervise the training of Persian personnel in the maintenance and operation of aircraft control and meteorological signals. Economic. 10. Export and import figures (in rials) for the first five months of 1324 (March-August 1945) are given as follows :•— Exports— Commercial goods 533,136,436 A.I.O.C. products 1,505,269,136 Fisheries .... 6,298,780 Imports— • Goods on which Customs Duties have been paid Goods exempt from Customs Duties Confiscated goods (not cleared from Customs) Fines collected 968,184,269 146,257,544 2,364,112 1,660,900 Appointments. 11- (i) Husain Khalipur to be Governor of Maku. (ii) Musa Iteza Lutfi to be Governor of Khalkhal.* 4 3 I British Interests. y^' ^ n T imitation to visit the United Kingdom has been given by the ims of Information to six editors of Persian newspapers. /Ayr i ^ b e Bntish and American Embassies have announced that M.E.S.C. (Middle East Supply Centre) in Persia will be dissolved as from the 1st November. iQfU rw i e Daily News will cease publication with its issue of the IJtli October. A daily news bulletin will be issued after that date by the Public Relations Bureau of the British Embassy. 15. The 1 endan Government signed, on the 7th October, the agreement to purchase e 0 ^® ri ^ s ^ Military telecommunications. (See Intelligence Summary, No. 37, Appendix “A,” paragraph 2.) A merican Interests. 16. American resentment has been aroused by the attitude of the Persian Government and the tone of the Persian press regarding the purchase of assets and the absence of any treaty governing the presence of American military lorces in Persia. The American Embassy has published a communique explaining its attitude to both questions. Regarding the assets the communique states that the American Government has never given any undertaking to hand over its surplus military assets free of charge. Concerning the non-conclusion of a tieaty it states that such a treaty was, in fact, proposed, but was dropped at the suggestion of the Persian Government as being unnecessary. 17. The air attache and assistant military attache of the American Embassy recently applied for a pass to the Russian military authorities to visit Meshed, travelling via Gurgan. They have been informed that a pass to visit Meshed can be granted but that the applicants should not travel via Gurgan as this aiea is unsafe. As the Soviet Embassy have turned back Persian gendarmerie proceeding to Gurgan to restore order and have repeatedly refused permission for Persian troops to be stationed there, their attitude is illogical though quite consistent with the widely-held belief that there are things goin 0, on in that area which they do not wish to be made public. Russian Interests. 18. There are reports, almost certainly exaggerated, from Persian sources of large-scale Russian troop movements in western Azerbaijan towards the Perso-Turkish frontier. According to one source, over 200 Russian aircraft were seen heading for the frontier, a hundred tanks had been seen making for Maku and Russian troops had been constructing defences in plain view of the Turks. Shots had even been exchanged between the opposing armies though no actual crossing of the frontier had taken place. Steps are being taken through consular sources to confirm or refute these reports. Chinese Interests. 19. His Excellency Mr. Li Tieh-tseng, Chinese Ambassador, has left Tehran for China on leave. Koweit Interests. 20. The existence of a Persian claim to Koweit was brought to mind recently by the question of the despatch of some Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s technicians from Abadan to Koweit. The Persian Government do not recognise the sovereignty of Koweit and will not issue visas for that country. The Koweit authorities, in their turn, insist on Persians wishing to enter Koweit having Persian passports with Koweit visas. To circumvent this, it is customary for Persians to visit Iraq first and obtain a Koweit visa there. Tehran, Ith October, 1945.J'Aa Lt+voleA.

Persian Affairs. The Majlis. THE only important business of the week has been the presentation of a Bill to postpone the next elections till the evacuation of Persia by all Allied troops is completed. Procedure of “ double urgency ” was sanctioned. The Bill was then passed by a large majority. Some minor officials of the Majlis presi dential body was elected. They were :— Secretaries : Zulfiqari, Jawad Masuli, Hashimi and Dr. Mujtahidi. Tellers : Afkhami, Hishmati and Mirat Isfandiari. 2. The Ministry of the Interior has addressed a circular to all Governors- General and Governors which states that the present time is not ripe for the setting up of provincial councils. Since the days of the second Majlis various laws have been passed which in fact run counter to the original laws providing for these councils. The centralisation of all governmental activities, which was such a feature in Reza Shah’s dictatorial regime, has rendered the establishment of these councils impractical without further legislation. It is obvious that, with all this clamour for autonomy in Azerbaijan, it would be unwise for the Persian Government to provide such a weapon for the separatists to use. 3. The Persian Government has announced the continuance of the ban on the Mecca pilgrimage as their relations with the Saudi Arabian Government have not been clarified. 4. The Cabinet has approved a proposal of the Ministry of the Interior that the Governorates-General (ustandari) of Eastern and Western Azerbaijan should be amalgamated. A ppointments. 5. Mustafa Quli Khosrovi to be Governor of Sari and Deputy Governor- General of Mazanderan. Communications. 6. The cost of constructing the Mianeh-Tabriz railway extension has been estimated at 50 million rials, and a Bill to authorise the necessary credit is to be tabled in the Majlis shortly. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 7. The Azerbaijan Democratic party concluded its first annual general meeting on the 5th October. At one of the earlier meetings it passed a resolution allowing the Persian Government one year within which it had to substitute Turki for Persian in all schools. It also expressed its disapproval of the appoint ment of Mehdi Farrukh as Governor-General of Azerbaijan and threatened violence if he attempted to take up his duties. As a counterblast, four hundred Azerbaijani notables have telegraphed to the Prime Minister to express their disgust at the actions of a few unknown immigrants in claiming to represent the population of Azerbaijan, and in despatching a telegram demanding autonomy to the Foreign Secretaries’ conference while in session in London. Khorasan. 8. The Tudeh party have recently turned their attention to students and teachers. Had not the party lost much ground recently through exposure of their aims, methods and Russian support, this latest investment would bring in a hand some dividend. Badly paid teachers and disillusioned students unable to find [71-9]employment after completion of their studies offer as good a target for Tudeh propaganda as peasants and workers hitherto approached with offers of agrarian and industrial reforms. British Interests. 9. The telecommunications agreement referred to in last Intelligence Summary, paragraph 15, provides for the payment of £300,000 as follows : 25 per^ cent, against signature, 25 per cent, within three months of signature and 50 per cent, within two months of the beginning of the next financial year (22nd March, 1946). Under this agreement the British military authorities undertake to supply line maintenance equipment and vehicles to a value of £30,000 for which separate payment will be made. 10. The six newspaper editors referred to in paragraph 12 of last Intelli gence Summary have left Tehran for the United Kingdom. American Interests. 11. The American Ambassador has addressed a note to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding the American financial advisers. The note states that they are not in a position to do any good and that this is injurious to the prestige of the American Government. As individuals scattered among various depart ments they are powerless to achieve anything, but concentrated as a mission under a chief they could make their presence felt. The Persian Government, while pre pared to recognise one of their number as spokesman or chief, for the purposes of internal administration of the advisers’ affairs, see in this request a veiled attempt to secure executive powers comparable to those previously wielded by Dr. Mills- paugh. Such powers they would under no circumstances grant to any individual adviser. No settlement has been reached as yet and there has been some talk in the press of the advisers resigning unless the situation is clarified. 12. Agreement has been reached on the sale of American railway assets. The Persian Government has paid 8 million dollars, and is to pay a further 2,100,000 dollars and is to receive 68 locomotives, 1,350 wagons, including 277 oil tank wagons, and 500,000 dollars’ worth of railway stores still in American possession. Russian Interests. 13. A consular source reports that a party of five Russian officers recently visited the town of Neh between Birjand and Zahidan. They were engaged in some sort of survey. 14. A protocol to the 1935 agreement between the U.S.S.R. and Persia relating to co-operation in combating agricultural pests has been signed in Tehran. 15. The Soviet Consul-General at Meshed has arrived in Tehran. The probable reason for his visit is to ensure that, in the event of Ali Mansur not returning to Meshed, a sufficiently subservient Governor-General may be appointed. 16. His Excellency the Soviet Ambassador has again left for Moscow, again without informing his colleagues. Before his departure he gave some vague reassurances to the Minister for Foreign Affairs concerning evacuation, and blandly said that the question of Persian troop movements in the Russian zone was of minor importance in the light of “ Soviet general policy,” by which he meant presumably evacuation by the expiry of the treaty period. 17. For some weeks there have been reports of an intention on the part of the Persian Government to send a good-will diplomatic mission to Moscow to improve the present strained relations between the two countries. The name of Ali Mansur, Governor-General of Khorasan, was mentioned as a possible leader of the mission. It was hoped that advice from various quarters might have led the Persian Government to abandon a plan which seemed unnecessary and possibly dangerous. It is now learnt, however, that the Persian Ambassador in Moscow, acting on instructions from his Government, did actually make the suggestion to the Soviet Government. Their reply was briefly to the effect that relations between the two countries could easily and instantly be improved by the Persians by reopening the question of the northern oil concession.

At the session of the 14th October the Minister of Finance tabled five Bills, among which the most important were requests for a credit of 50 million rials for road and railway development in Azerbaijan, a request for credit for the purchase of American Railway assets, and a 2/12th budget Bill for the period the 21st September- 20th November, 1945. On the 15th October a number of influential Deputies met to discuss measures for the prevention of unconstitutional acts by Government employees during the intervening period between the 14th and 15th Majlises which will now occur as the result of the postponement of the new elections. 2. The letters exchanged between Mr. Bevin and M. Molotov on the subject of the evacuation of Persia by Allied troops have been published in the Persian press. The Court. 3. The Court has announced that, in view of the presence of foreign troops in Persia, the usual celebrations and receptions in connexion with the Shah’s birthday (26th October) will not be held this year, with the exception of the official “ salam ” (levee). The expenses incurred by these celebrations in normal times will be devoted to poor relief during the coming winter. Appointments. 4. — (i) Abdul Husein Salar Yahipur to be Governor of Maragheh. (ii) Muhammad Hadi to be Governor of Zahidan. Mehdi Farrukh (Mutasam-us-Salteneh) has not yet taken up his appointment as Governor-General of Eastern Azerbaijan (see Intelligence Summary No. 38, paragraph 11 (vii)), nor is it now believed that he will do so. A Moscow paper stated that, in view of Mehdi Farrukh’s past history and present political beliefs, his appointment by the Persian Government to this post must be regarded as an act of deliberate provocation. This Russian opposition and the fact that Farrukh is temperamentally unsuited for this, or, indeed, for any other post, will almost certainly induce the Persian Government to find some more suitable man. The name of Ali Mansur, who has had ample experience of Russian methods during his three years’ tenure of the post of Governor-General, Khorasan, is being men tioned as a possible candidate, as is also that of Khalil Fahimi (Fahim-ul-Mulk) (F.O. 59; M.A. 82) who was Minister without portfolio in Bayat’s Cabinet of April 1945. Persian Army. 5. Four more officers from Khorasan, two from Tabriz and one from Kazvin have been arrested in connexion with the recent mutiny. 6. The Chief of the General Staff is fully aware of the urgent necessity for bettering the appalling financial conditions under which Persian officers serve and has asked the Minister for War to lose no time in procuring Cabinet and Majlis agreement to his proposals for financial relief. 7. Ibrahim Zand, the Minister of War, is reliably reported to have tendered his resignation to His Imperial Majesty the Shah, who has not yet accepted it. The alleged reasons are ill-health, disagreement with the Chief of the General Staff and a premonition that the Cabinet will soon fall. He is leaving for Palestine immediately to undergo another operation. r 7i-4i]2 * Civil Aviation. (See Intelligence Summary No. 39, paragraph 8.) 8. The Americans appear to be pressing for (i) immediate provisional rights to run a Tehran-Abadan service to connect with the outside world, (ii) later on, for rights on a route Turkey-Persia-Afghanistan-India-China, for which Pan- American Airways hold a C.A.B. licence. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. U 9. A report emanating from the General Officer Commanding, Tabriz, states that Mullah Mustafa Barzani, having fled from the Iraqi forces, has taken refuge in Persia. Accompanied by 2,000 followers (of whom 500 are armed and in possession of a field gun) he arrived in Western Azerbaijan on the 16th October. He has, apparently, been allowed by the Russian military authorities to camp in a village 15 kilom. south of Rezaieh. The Persian commandant of Rezaieh has been ordered by the General Officer Commanding, Tabriz, to inform Mullah Mustafa that he is a fugitive from justice and that he must lay down his arms and obey the orders of the local Persian commander. Unless the Russian military authorities, who are in complete control of the area, endorse these orders, there is but little chance of their being obeyed. 10. There is some reliable evidence to show that at least four lorry-loads of rifles have been delivered by the Russians to Ghazi Muhammad in Mahabad, and some less reliable evidence to the effect that others have been delivered by the Russians to Kurdish tribes, including those actually engaged in hostilities against the Iraq Government. Fars. 11. There are signs of the recrudescence of the old rivalry between Nasir Khan Qashgai and his uncle AH Khan, Salar Hishmat. The latter is believed to be intriguing with the Shisbulukis, and possibly with other sub-tribes of the Qashgai, to entice them away from Nasir Khan’s overlordship. The Shiraz paper Paigham, in its issue of the 4th October, published the text of a telegram sent by Nasir Khan to the Persian Government in Tehran, in which, after extolling his own efforts to keep the peace in Fars since the outbreak of the war, he declines any further responsibility in this respect, because the present Government is reactionary, differs little from that of Reza Shah, and shows no sign of desiring to better the living conditions of the poor in Persia. Though no immediate threat to the prevailing peace of Fars is expected as a result of this telegram, its effect is, none the less, unfortunate as tending to shatter the solidarity of the Qawam-Nasir Khan-Murteza Quli Khan alliance and as embarrassing to the Persian Govern ment at a time when their attention and armed resources must shortly be devoted to the restoration of order in the northern provinces. British Interests. 12. Some progress has been made in inducing the Persian Government to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s area of operations after the evacuation of British troops. The Persian Prime Minister has promised to table a Bill in the Majlis as soon as possible to obtain the necessary credit for increased police allowances. The chief prefect of police has sent telegraphic instructions to the chief of police of Khuzistan to begin enlisting 100 extra constables. The agreement of the Chief of the General Staff, the Chief Prefect of Police and the American Chief Adviser to the Gendarmerie has been obtained to the responsibility for the security of the A.I.O.C. area being vested in the General Officer Commanding, Khuzistan Division, who will co-ordinate the tasks of the army, gendarmerie and police under this head without interfering in their administration. So lacking is the liaison and so strong are the jealousies between these departments (as, indeed, between any two departments of the Persian Government) that this agreement has not been easy to obtain. 13. Despite the fact that the so-called “ evacuation ” of Tehran by Russian troops has resulted in little diminution in their numbers the Moscow press has attempted to make political capital out of it by stressing the fiction that, whereas the Russians and the Americans have evacuated Tehran, the British have not yet done so. Although the figures for those remaining behind in Tehran (“ British Army Liquidation Staff”) had been communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as long ago as the 20th September (and also to the Russian and American Military Attaches, and to the Chief of the General Staff on the 18th September, it was judged expedient to publish these figures as a press communique. This was3 one on he 17th October. Detailed figures for officers and other ranks were given. ? na ure °t the various duties, e.g., disposals, hirings, claims, &amp;c., was explained ?? ' precast made as to when the various departments would have concluded en asks and have left Tehran. The communique has had an excellent effect. A merican Interests. reai edy the acute shortage of railway oil tank wagons the United ates Military Disposals Board are prepared to sell to the Iranian State Railway tvV ^ rther i ^ a g aiI ist a payment of $600,000. Some obstruction from the Majlis may be expected when the Bill is tabled to ask for the rial credit sufficient to provide this sum and the $2,100,000 still due to the Americans (referred to ^ Paragraph 12 of Intelligence Summary No. 40). In the event of a refusal by the Majlis to grant these credits the Minister of Finance will probably request a loan from the Imperial Bank of Iran. Russian Interests. 15. Reports have reached the embassy from various sources which tell of Russian activity in the matter of oil in Northern Persia. There is little doubt that they have concluded a geological survey in the Semnan area roughly corresponding with what are believed to be the boundaries of the old Khurian concession. An undoubted oil-drilling rig has been observed at Haft Tan beside the railway between Shirgah and Shahi. A report, more difficult to credit, states that the Russians are actually shipping oil from the Ashuradeh peninsula in the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea. Efforts are being made to verify this, but the area has been made almost inaccessible by the Russians. Polish Interests. 16. Some difficulty is being experienced in the move of about 3,000 Poles who still remain in Persia after the evacuation of the Isfahan contingent of Poles. This difficulty is due to the inability of the Lebanon authorities to absorb them as quickly as was first estimated. French Interests. 17. M. Pierre Lafond, delegate in Persia of the Provisional French Government, has been appointed Ambassador to Persia and presented his letters of credence to His Imperial Majesty the Shah on the 20th October. P.S.—The Persian Prime Minister tendered his resignation to His Imperial Majesty the Shah on the 21st October, 1945.

Copy No. 1 0 J ? j t j Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 42, Secret, for the Period ^nd October to 28£A October, 1945.— {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 376 of 30£A October, 1945; received in Foreign Office %th November.) Persian Affairs. Political. 1. As reported in a postscript to last Intelligence Summary, Muhsin Sadr tendered his resignation to H.I.M. the Shah on the 21st October. Press accounts give as the reason for his resignation the continued attacks by Dr. Musaddiq and the continued opposition by the Majlis to all bills tabled by his Government even after the securing of a vote of confidence on the 27th September. With all his disappointments, however, Muhsin Sadr can claim some small achievements during his period of office. The general situation in the country is no worse. The Tudeh, largely through the firm action of his Cabinet, has been rendered harmless for the moment in Tehran though in part their disappearance from the arena is due to the cessation of open support by the Russians in Tehran who, now that they have in theory evacuated the capital, can no longer provide protection for bands of Tudeh toughs by escorts of Russian soldiers armed with tommy guns. Sadr has found the money for the purchase of British military telecommunications and the greater part of the American military railway assets. He has paid Persia s contribution to U.N.R.R.A. He secured the passing of the law to post pone the next elections till all foreign troops have left the country. He has, at least, shown himself aware of the pressing needs of security in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s area and had undertaken to table a Bill to provide the necessary credits. In the face of the prevailing apathy in all Government departments, the hostility of the Russians, the ceaseless opposition of the minority and the obstruction of the Majlis as a whole, his record bears favourable comparison with that of his predecessors. 2. The President of the Majlis was received in audience by the Shah on the 21st October and was requested to urge the Majlis to choose a new Prime Minister by the 24th October. This they did with commendable promptitude and, at a secret session on the 24th October, elected Ibrahim Hakimi (Hakim-ul-Mulk), who received seventy-five votes as against six cast for Qawam-us-Saltaneh. There were thirteen abstentions. Hakimi was Prime Minister for about one month in May oi this year. Hakimi has not yet presented his Cabinet to the Majlis. 3. Other business in the Majlis during the week has been the election of the various Majlis commissions, an announcement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Persia would be evacuated by Allied troops by the 2nd March, 1946, discussion of the Bill to authorise payment for the remaining American railwav assets and the passing of a l/12th budget Bill for Mihr 1324 (23rd September- 22nd October, 1945). 4. On the 26th October, the birthday of H.I.M. the Shah, the customary levee was held in the Gulestan Palace. A ppointments. 5.—(i) Major Farzanegan to be assistant military attache in Washinoton vice Ali Qawam (son of the Qawam-ul-Mulk), who has returned to Persia, Major Farzanegan spent some time in England under training with Marconis. He speaks good English and has for the past three years been Persian assistant to General Ridley of the American Military Mission. (ii) Abbas Sadr, Chief of the Hamadan Municipality, has been appointed acting Governor of Hamadan vice Sardar Akram recalled. [71—139]2 Internal Security. Khorasan. 6. Khorasan is still without*a governor-general and the governor and mayor have not yet returned to Meshed from Tehran. Fathullah Pakrevan (Amir-i-Arfa) (F.O. 169-M.A. 208) is reported to have refused the post of governor-general. Opposition to his appointment is also reported to have come from religious circle^^ ^4 in Meshed who have bitter memories of Pakrevan’s previous tenure of that pos(|w from 1934 to 1942, during which period Asadi, the custodian of the shrine, was^ shot for treason and a number of rioters were machine-gunned within the precincts of the shrine. 7. Security on the Meshed-Zahidan road has deteriorated and all traffic between Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari after sunset has to travel in convoy with a gendarmerie escort. Khuzistan. 8. The following extract from Ahwaz Consulate-General Diary No. 18 (lst-15th October) gives an interesting picture of affairs on the Perso-Iraqi border : — Sepehr-Rad, the aged inspector of the Ministry of the Interior, has inspected Dasht-i-Mishun, of which he was governor seventeen years ago. He brings back a story that about ten days before he left, Brigadier Humayuni gave certain assurances to some Bani Turuf Sheikhs living across the frontier, relying on which, Muhammad Asi, the brother of Yunus, came back to Persia and, as reported in Ahwaz News No. (15), was killed by the Sawari tribe. The inspector paints a sorry picture of inefficiency and intrigue. His version is as follows: At present the Persian Government has armed Moula Nasrullah, bakhsdar of Hewaizeh, and relies on him and his followers to neutralise the Bani Turuf. Meanwhile, the number of Persian Government departments is absurdly large for such a small area: there is an O.C. Garrison, a Frontier Commander, a Security Officer, a Gendarmerie Commander, and a Head of Police, with civilians such as the Director of Posts, Civil Regis tration, Customs, Economics, Finance, &amp;c., all nominally under a Farmandar, who assisted by a Mayor or head of the Municipality. All these officials are at daggers drawn with one another. The Security Officer, Mustafa Khuzistani, does not take bribes but is no politician and cannot keep order. The inspector’s solution is (1) disarmament of all tribesmen, including the Howaizeh Arabs, and the increase of the garrison from 30 to 100, the area being run by a strong military governor : (2) exile of the accused Bani Turuf Sheikhs and also of Moula Nasrullah, Ahmad Ziarat, and Sheikh Ismail, and (3) equitable redistribution of the lands.” Bakhtiari. 9. There is growing discontent among the rival branch of the tribe at Murteza Quli Khan’s autocratic rule and at what they consider to be his virtual monopoly of the fruits of office. That Bakhtiari is comparatively tranquil matters but little to them who would prefer disorder and a “ free for all ” situation. Recently Manuchihr Khan assembled a band of malcontents in Junagan where he had collected arms and money, but in the end wiser counsels prevailed and he obeyed the summons to return to Isfahan which had been given by the General Officer Commanding, Isfahan Division. Azerbaijan. 10. A consular source states that the first result of the Russians’ gift to Qazi Muhammad of a printing press and two tons of paper has been a manifesto of the “ Democratic party of Kurdistan.” This document, which is printed in Persian and Kurdish in parallel columns, after a preamble glancing at the wrongs suffered in ages past at the hands of Persian tyrants, makes the following demands :— {a) An autonomous Kurdistan within the frontiers of the Persian State- (5) The use of the Kurdish language in schools and the administration of Kurdistan; (c) The immediate election of a provincial council for Kurdistan to supervise all social and Government affairs;4 3 Selection of Government officials exclusively from the people of Kurdistan; Promulgation of a law to regulate relations between peasants and landlords; Co-operation with the other races of Azerbaijan, Armenians, Assyrians, &amp;c., to establish unity and brotherhood in the country; Exploitation of the natural resources of Kurdistan for the benefit of its people. The Russians are laying new military telephone lines between Tabriz and Julfa and between Tabriz and Maragheh. 12. The Persian General Officer Commanding, Tabriz, hearing, incorrectly as it subsequently turned out, that Mehdi Farrukh was arriving to assume the duties of governor-general, despatched a party of twenty-five Persian military to meet him at Bostanabad not only as a guard of honour but also to prevent any disturbances such as had been threatened by the Tudeh party if he should arrive. The General Officer Commanding first obtained from the Russian military head quarters the pass which is necessary for all Persian armed forces to have before movement is permitted by the Russians. On arrival at the Russian military check post at the eastern exit of the town of Tabriz the party was stopped by the Russians on the grounds that, though the pass was for twenty-five men, there was no mention of their arms! (&lt;*) M (/) *lh {g) n. Fars. 13. Ali Khan, Salar Hishmat (see paragraph 11 of last Intelligence Summary) has telegraphed to the Persian Prime Minister to say that, as Nasir Khan Qashgai has renounced his charge of the tribe he, Ali Khan, has assumed it. The local General Officer Commanding does not consider this as a serious threat to security as Ali Khan’s influence is not such as to enable him to assume this responsibility. The General Officer Commanding also advised Nasir Khan that poverty and a sense of grievance have induced Ali Khan to take this step and that restitution of the properties which Saulat-ud-Dowleh. Nasir Khan’s father, stole from Ali Khan would be the best method of settling the dispute. 14. The Boir Ahmedi have started raiding in the Abadeh-Semirun- Yezdikhwast area which they do every year after that area has been evacuated by the downward migrating Qashgai. A small motorized force of gendarmerie has been sent to protect that section of the Isfahan-Shiraz road which is within reach of these raiders. British Interests. 15. Mr. H. L. Farquhar, M.C., arrived in Tehran on the 26th October, 1945, to assume the duties of counsellor at His Majesty’s Embassy.

Persian Affairs. Political. 1. The Prime Minister, Ibrahim Hakimi (Hakim-ul-Mulk), presented his Cabinet to H.I.M. the Shah on the 3rd November and to the Majlis on the 4th November. It comprises :— Without Portfolio : Hasan ’Ali Kamal Hidayet. Interior : Khalil Fahimi (Fahim-ul-Mulk). Justice : Amanullah Ardalan. Finance : ’Abdul Husain Hajir. Agriculture : Ahmad Husain ’Adi. Without Portfolio : Allahyar Salih. War : Major-General Riazi. Posts and Telegraphs : Muhammad Nariman. Health: Dr. Malik. Education : Ghulam Husain Rahnama. Communications : Major-General Muhammad Husain Firuz. Foreign Affairs : Abul Qasim Najm. Commerce and Industry : To be appointed, provisionally under Prime Minister. With the exception of Najm (believed to be on his way from Kabul, where he has been ambassador) and Firuz, all the above have previously held Cabinet rank. Hidayet, Dr. Malik and Rahnama were members of the previous Cabinet. 2. On the 4th November the Prime Minister presented his Government’s programme to the Majlis. It contained six points, which can be summarised as follows :— (i) Maintenance of friendly relations with foreign Powers and fulfilment of Persia’s undertakings under the United Nations Charter. (ii) Rehabilitation of the armed forces of the country to enable them the better to carry out their duties in maintaining security. (iii) Budget reform, tax revision, raising of the standard of living. (iv) Reorganisation of the Ministry of Health. (v) Revision of laws governing the organisation and administration of the country. (vi) Conduct of the next elections. 3 . On the 6 th November the Government obtained a vote of confidence on its programme, receiving 97 votes out of 103. The six Tudeh Deputies did not vote, though Kambakhsh, the Tudeh Deputy, made a violent attack on the Government, the governing classes, the army, and Persia’s foreign policy, which were leading to an estrangement between her and Russia. Internal Security. Kurdistan {South). 4 . The Chief of the General Staff stated to the British Military Attache that no withdrawal from their forward positions near the Perso-Iraqi frontier had yet been begun by the Persian troops. He also stated that the Kani senani and Dizli chieftains w : ere still in refuge across the frontier in Iraq and that he had asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to approach the Iraqi Government with a view to their preventing the return to Persia of these two men. In this connexion it will be interesting to learn what replies are given by the Persian Government to a parallel request believed to have been made by the Iraqi Government to the [71—203]2 Persian Government for similar services in respect of Mulla Mustafa and Sheikh Ahmed Barzani, who had conversely fled from their forces into Persia. In actual fact, the Persians could render no such assistance as the area in which the two fugitives are now living* is completely under Russian military control. The C.G.S. also stated that the troops would be withdrawn to their winter quarters within a month, two battalions being quartered at Merivan and the remaining nine at Baneh, Sardasht, Saqqiz and Senneh. A zerbmjan. 5. One of the Kurdish chiefs, who recently visited Baku, is reliably reported to have said that the party was received in an interview by Baghirov, the President of the Azerbaijan Republic, who promised Soviet support for the Kurdish Independence movement provided the Kurds would work with the new Democratic party of Persian Azerbaijan. The Tudeh party was never popular with the Kurdish chiefs because of its programme of agrarian reform, highly repugnant to such large land-owners, but the Democratic party is not so repugnant being less radical in its programme. 6 . A consular report states that Mulla Mustafa and Sheikh Ahmed Barzani have conferred with Ghazi Muhammad of Mahabad on the Kurdish Indepen dence movement and on the chances of continuing their struggle next spring against the Iraq forces. Reports from other sources tell of other Kurdish chieftains being taken in Russian military lorries, on the 20th October, to Mahabad, to attend the same conference, and on the 22nd October of seven lorry loads of Russian rifles and 400,000 rials being delivered to Ghazi Muhammad, also the staging of a conference by the Russians at Maku between Persian Azerbaijani notables and Kurds and, lastly, of a withdrawal of Russian troops from the Perso-Turkish border to their garrison towns of Maku, Khoi, Rezaieh, &amp;c. If these reports are true, as they seem to be, two possible conclusions are (i) that the Russians are anxious to unite Persian Azerbaijanis and Kurds in support of the Autonomous Azerbaijan movement, and (ii) that they intend to use the Kurds of Persia and Iraq and not their own troops to further these designs in anticipa tion of the period subsequent to 2nd March, when they will have no troops in Persia to use in this connexion. 7. The Democratic party has announced its intention to begin forthwith the arrangements for both Majlis and Provincial Council elections. A appointments. 8 . (i) Dr. Nasr, previously Governor-General of Mazanderan, to be Inspector- General of the Ministry of the Interior. (ii) Muhsin Shahrukhi, formerly head of the Personnel Department in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, to be Director of the Contracts and Legal Affairs Department in the same Ministry. (iii) Muhammad Husain Najm to be head of the Personnel Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (iv) Hadi Arbabi to be Governor of Shahriza. (v) Daulatshahi, recently appointed Director of Finance for Eastern and Western Azerbaijan, has also been appointed acting Governor- General of the two Ustans pending an official appointment by the Ministry of the Interior. Persian Gendarmerie. 9. Colonel Schwarzkopf stated to the B.M.A. that— (i) There was an overall shortage of about 4,000 in the total establishment of fifteen regiments. (ii) That he was disregarding the prohibition of enlisting as gendarmes men who had not performed their military conscription service and that, when asked by the Ministry of War to surrender an individual wanted for conscription, he refused to do so on the ground that the man was, in the gendarmerie, performing military service of equal importance. (iii) That he hoped soon to get Cabinet sanction for his proposed gendarmerie officers’ training college which would enable him to train his own officers and to dispense with the leavings of the Persian army which formed his present officer cadre.3 British Interests. C.I.G.S. and the G.O.C.-in-C., Middle East, visited Abadan and oilneids between the 2nd and the 4 th November. 11 . Sir W illiam Fraser, chairman of the A.I.O.C. Limited, visited Tehran at the end of October. He was received in audience by H.I.M. the Shah and was entertained at an official luncheon at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 12 . A commission was tield in Ahwaz on the 5 th November to arrange for ■ gradual reassumption of responsibility of the Persian Government for the security of the A.I.O.C. s area of operations. British consular representatives, iepiesentatives of the A.I.O.C. and the Persian military gendarmerie and police chiefs attended. The Commander, South Persia Area (British), presided. The strength and disposition of the Persian army in Khuzistan were considered satisfactory. Gendarmerie reinforcements not being available, the organisa tion out of the existing Khuzistan regiment of two companies each of three platoons, especially for A.I.O.C. protection, was considered the best solution for the time being. The police again maintained that the low rates of pay offered prevented them recruiting the extra numbers required. Pressure brought upon the last Prime Minister to provide the necessary credits for increased pay is being maintained upon his successor. The agreement of the gendarmerie and police headquarters in Tehran (an agreement not obtained without difficulty) to place their forces in Khuzistan under the orders of the Persian Army Divisional Commander for purposes of A.I.O.C. security will, it is hoped, lead to better co-ordination of these duties. Russian Interests. 13. The Russian consular agent at Zabol recently visited Zahidan, Khwash and Bam, and spread rumours to the effect that the Americans were to receive oil concessions at Safidawa and Khwash, adding that such concessions would be beneficial to Persia. It is reasonable to draw the conclusion that such rumours, invented by the Russians, would justify the granting of similar concessions in the north-west of Persia to the Russians by the Azerbaijan Provincial Council which, from all reliable accounts, the Russians are actively trying to form.. 14. The Russians are preventing the despatch of food-stuff's, dried fruits and leather from Tabriz to Tehran. Russian cotton goods are allowed to pass. The Russians played this game before, creating a surplus with cheap prices in those parts of Persia under their military occupation and a shortage with high prices in the rest of the country. Their hireling press then expatiated on the joys of living in the Russian “ zone.' 15. Some months ago the Russo-Persian Cultural Relations Society decided to send forty-one students to study at Moscow University. The students were chosen after open competition and are to leave gradually for Russia. The first six left by plane last Sunday. They are to spend one year first learning Russian in Baku and they will then enter Moscow University. American Interests. 16. The American Embassy, on instructions from the State Department, has informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that, as the conditions on which an American economic and financial mission had been sent to Persia were no longer in force, the functions of the mission would terminate on the 21st November next. It is, however, left to individual members of the mission to make, if they so desire, individual contracts with the Persian Government. It is thought that some six of them will elect to remain in Persian Government service (see Intelligence Summary No. 40, paragraph 11). 17. 1 The Commanding General, A.M.E.T., has accepted the responsibility for the security of all American military personnel in the Persian Gulf Com mand with effect from mid-December having been informed that, owing to the gradual evacuation of Persia, British troops will not be available for that purpose after that date. 18. The Americans have now been paid a sum of $2,139,000, being the balance due from the Persian Government for rolling-stock, tankers and loco motives (see Intelligence Summary No. 41, paragraph 14).^ r r J Rjl LLwcLla. ■ ^ ILCAjdasUf oECREl' THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’ PERSIA.

In this connexion it will be interesting to learn what replies are given by the Persian Government to a parallel request believed to have been made by the Iraqi Government to the [71—203]2 Persian Government for similar services in respect of Mulla Mustafa and Sheikh Ahmed Barzani, who had conversely fled from their forces into Persia. In actual fact, the Persians could render no such assistance as the area in which the two fugitives are now living is completely under Russian military control. The C.G.S. also stated that the troops would be withdrawn to their winter quarters within a month, tw r o battalions being quartered at Merivan and the remaining nine at Baneh, Sardasht, Saqqiz and Senneh. A zerbaijan. 5. One of the Kurdish chiefs, who recently visited Baku, is reliably reported to have said that the party was received in an interview by Baghirov, the President of the Azerbaijan Republic, who promised Soviet support for the Kurdish Independence movement provided the Kurds would work with the new Democratic party of Persian Azerbaijan. The Tudeh party was never popular with the Kurdish chiefs because of its programme of agrarian reform, highly repugnant to such large land-owners, but the Democratic party is not so repugnant being less radical in its programme. 6 . A consular report states that Mulla Mustafa and Sheikh Ahmed Barzani have conferred with Ghazi Muhammad of Mahabad on the Kurdish Indepen dence movement and on the chances of continuing their struggle next spring against the Iraq forces. Reports from other sources tell of other Kurdish chieftains being taken in Russian military lorries, on the 20th October, to Mahabad, to attend the same conference, and on the 22nd October of seven lorry loads of Russian rifles and 400,000 rials being delivered to Ghazi Muhammad, also the staging of a conference by the Russians at Maku between Persian Azerbaijani notables and Kurds and, lastly, of a withdrawal of Russian troops from the Perso-Turkish border to their garrison towns of Maku, Khoi, Rezaieh, &amp;c. If these reports are true, as they seem to be, two possible conclusions are (i) that the Russians are anxious to unite Persian Azerbaijanis and Kurds in support of the Autonomous Azerbaijan movement, and (ii) that they intend to use the Kurds of Persia and Iraq and not their own troops to further these designs in anticipa tion of the period subsequent to 2nd March, when they will have no troops in Persia to use in this connexion. 7. The Democratic party has announced its intention to begin forthwith the arrangements for both Majlis and Provincial Council elections. A 'ppointments. 8 . (i) Dr. Nasr, previously Governor-General of Mazanderan, to be Inspector- General of the Ministry of the Interior. (ii) Muhsin Shahrukhi, formerly head of the Personnel Department in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, to be Director of the Contracts and Legal Affairs Department in the same Ministry. (iii) Muhammad Husain Najm to be head of the Personnel Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (iv) Hadi Arbabi to be Governor of Shahriza. (v) Daulatshahi, recently appointed Director of Finance for Eastern and Western Azerbaijan, has also been appointed acting Governor- General of the two Ustans pending an official appointment by the Ministry of the Interior. Persian Gendarmerie. 9. Colonel Schwarzkopf stated to the B.M.A. that— (i) There was an overall shortage of about 4,000 in the total establishment of fifteen regiments. (ii) That he was disregarding the prohibition of enlisting as gendarmes men w ho had not performed their military conscription service and that, w hen asked by the Ministry of War to surrender an individual wanted for conscription, he refused to do so on the ground that the man Was, in the gendarmerie, performing military service of equal importance. (iii) That he hoped soon to get Cabinet sanction for his proposed gendarmerie officers’ training college which would enable him to train his own officers and to dispense with the leavings of the Persian army which formed his present officer cadre.British Interests. 10 . The C.I.G.S. and the G.O.C.-in-C., Middle East, visited Abadan and oilfields between the 2 nd and the 4th November. 11 . Sir William Fraser, chairman of the A.LO.C. Limited, visited Tehran at the end of October. He was received in audience by H.I.M. the Shah and was entertained at an official luncheon at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 12 . A commission was held in Ahwaz on the 5 th November to arrange for t| the gradual reassumption of responsibility of the Persian Government for the security of the A.I.O.C. s area of operations. British consular representatives, representatives of the A.I.O.C. and the Persian military gendarmerie and police chiefs attended. The Commander, South Persia Area (British), presided. The strength and disposition of the Persian army in Khuzistan were considered satis!actory. Gendarmerie reinforcements not being available, the organisa tion out of the existing Khuzistan regiment of two companies each of three platoons, especially for A.I.O.C. protection, was considered the best solution for the time being. The police again maintained that the low rates of pay offered prevented them recruiting the extra numbers required. Pressure brought upon the last Prime Minister to provide the necessary credits for increased pay is being maintained upon his successor. The agreement of the gendarmerie and police headquarters in Tehran (an agreement not obtained without difficulty) to place their forces in Khuzistan under the orders of the Persian Army Divisional Commander for purposes of A.I.O.C. security will, it is hoped, lead to better co-ordination of these duties. . Russian Interests. 13. The Russian consular agent at Zabol recently visited Zahidan, Khwash and Bam, and spread rumours to the effect that the Americans were to receive oil concessions at Safidawa and Khwash, adding that such concessions would be beneficial to Persia. It is reasonable to draw the conclusion that such rumours, invented by the Russians, would justify the granting of similar concessions in the north-west of Persia to the Russians by the Azerbaijan Provincial Council which, from all reliable accounts, the Russians are actively trying to form. 14. The Russians are preventing the despatch of food-stuff's, dried fruits and leather from Tabriz to Tehran. Russian cotton goods are allowed to pass. The Russians played this game before, creating a surplus with cheap prices in those parts of Persia under their military occupation and a shortage with high prices in the rest of the country. Their hireling press then expatiated on the joys of living in the Russian “ zone.” 15. Some months ago the Russo-Persian Cultural Relations Society decided to send forty-one students to study at Moscow University. The students were chosen after open competition and are to leave gradually for Russia. The first six left by plane last Sunday. They are to spend one year first learning Russian in Baku and they will then enter Moscow University. American Interests. 16. The American Embassy, on instructions from the State Department, has informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that, as the conditions on which an American economic and financial mission had been sent to Persia were no longer in force, the functions of the mission would terminate on the 21st November next. It is, however, left to individual members of the mission to make, if they so desire, individual contracts with the Persian Government. It is thought that some six of them will elect to remain in Persian Government service (see Intelligence Summary No. 40, paragraph 11). 17. The Commanding General, A.M.E.T., has accepted the responsibility for the security of all American military personnel in the Persian Gulf Com mand with effect from mid-December having been informed that, owing to the gradual evacuation of Persia, British troops will not be available for that purpose after that date. 18. The Americans have now been paid a sum of $2,139,000, being the balance due from the Persian Government for rolling-stock, tankers and loco motives (see Intelligence Summary No. 41, paragraph 14).wttn xr.:&gt; of th§ 37 1 SQjp '?i§r Foreign AffaiVft ^ £ 1 W lifi fc.

THk session of the 11th November was mostly taken up by one of Dr. Musaddiq s long-winded orations in which he attacked Mahmud Bader, the Minister of iinance in Sadr’s recent Cabinet, for alleged malpractices in the sale of crown lands and also pressed for more speedy action in the matter of the indictments against Suheili and Tadayyun. On the 13th November, after a long debate in which the Tudeh Deputy, Dr. Kishavarz, violently opposed the employment of any foreign advisers in any capacity, the Bill for the engagement of Dr. Avery as adviser to the Ministry of Health was passed. The amended Conscription Bill was also passed (see paragraph 2 below). A question was put to the Prime Minister by Deputy Fuladwand asking, in view of the British communique on the evacuation of Tehran, Hamadan and Kermanshah, which cities of Persia had been evacuated by the Russians. At the session of the 15th November several Deputies expressed surprise at the announcement by Radio Paris of the existence of separatist movements in Kurdistan and Azerbaijan. The Minister of War tabled his Bill for the two new divisions, for a credit for purchase of material and a credit to provide financial relief for army officers (see Intelligence Summary No. 38, Appendix). In the ensuing debate the Tudeh Deputies, Kambaksh and Radmanish, made attacks on army administration, the Chief of the General Staff in person and the misuse of military power by employing it to oppress labour movements. The debate is to be resumed. Persian Army. 2 . The main points in the new Conscription Law passed by the Majlis (see paragraph 1 above) are as follows :— (i) If the lists of those liable for conscription in any one area show a surplus over requirements, then conscripts shall be chosen by lot. (ii) If the availability lists show a deficit, then conscripts who drew exemption in last year’s lot will be taken to make up the deficit. (iii) If a conscript draws exemption in successive years till he is aged 26 he will be considered as permanently exempt and relegated to the reserve. Economic. 3. The import and sale of cloth will no longer be a Government monopoly but owing to financial stringency the monopoly tax, in addition to custom duty, will continue to be levied.

(ii) - Sartip Muhammad Baqir Amir Nizami is reappointed additional Deputy Chief of the General Staff. (iii) Sartip Muhsin Diba from Director of Artillery to be Director of the Officers’ Club. (iv) Sartip Abdullah Hidayet from en disponibilite to be Director of Artillery. Internal Security. Khorasan. 5. Security has further declined and some more hold-ups are reported between Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari; Meshed and Nishapur and near Turba-i- Sheikh Jam. [72—52]2 Azerbaijan. 6 . Reports from more than one Kurdish source tell of the forcible billeting of Mulla Mustafa’s followers by the Russians on the various Kurdish tribes in the neighbourhood of Lake Urumiyeh. According to one source 150 families are billeted at Bukan, 150 on villages between Sulduz and Mahabad, 100 on Mahabad itself. The rest appear to be distributed between Ushnu and Naqadeh. A considerable sum of money has also been collected from the Persian Kurds for r relief. The same source reports that, left to themselves, Mulla Mustafa’s followers x would probably prefer to seek an amnesty from the Iraqi Government and return'^ to Iraq, but that the Russians are preventing this and have instructed the fugitives to say that they have been reduced to their present plight by bombing from British aircraft. 7. The Azerbaijan Democratic party has sent a circular to foreign consuls in Tabriz giving details of alleged atrocities committed by gendarmes against peasants and asks that the Great Powers be informed of the “people’s” sufferings. That the people have suffered is true, but not at the hands of the gendarmerie but at the hands of hireling cads of Armenians, Assyrians and Chaldeans, who, emboldened by the support of their Russian masters, have the temerity to style themselves the people of Azerbaijan. Meetings of the Democratic party held in Tabriz on the 15th November demanded immediate election of the Provincial Council and the adoption of the Turki language. 8 . The general situation has deteriorated sharply in Azerbaijan during the past few days. A party of Democrats attacked Mianeh Railway Station, over powered the railway police and shot an officer and four Persian soldiers of the Conscription Department, the sole representatives of the Persian army in Mianeh. The town is said to be in their hands. Near Maragheh a skirmish took place between Democrats and gendarmes. Two of the Democrats were wounded and thirteen made prisoner. Later the Russian Commandant at Maragheh intervened by disarming the gendarmes and setting free the prisoners. The Chief of the General Staff also informed the British Military Attache that the towns of Ahar, Maragheh and Sarah are in the hands of the Democrats, that they are being issued with new Brno rifles by the Russians, that these rifles are part of those taken by the Russians from the Persian army at the time of the occupation, that Red army soldiers have been put into mufti and armed, that attacks on Persian Government buildings and Persian army barracks are expected very soon and that the Persian General Officer Commanding, Tabriz Division, had been ordered to defend these localities to the last. Russian Interests. 9. Some further news has been received regarding the report that the Russians were actually engaged in shipping oil from the Ashuradeh peninsula near Bandar Shah (see Intelligence Summary No. 41, paragraph 15). It now appears that the pipes and other material seen were brought for the purpose of construction of oil tanks at the port of Bandar Shah and the improvement of the pipe-line from the port to the town in order to facilitate the discharge of oil from tankers. 10. There is no sign of any relaxation of Russian control of the northern, north-western and north-eastern sections of the Iranian State Railway. Some twenty officers of field rank are still employed at Tehran railway station alone. Iraqi Interests. 11. Seyyid Ahbas Mehdi Beg, formerly Iraqi Minister in Tehran, has been appointed Minister in Moscow and has arrived in Tehran on his way to his new post. Czechoslovak Interests. 12. The Czechoslovak Military Attache has announced that his office has been temporarily closed. Lieutenant-Colonel J. Lipa and Captain Kalmus are to leave shortly. 13. A party of some 300 Czechs are to leave shortly for their country via Russia on repatriation. They have been in Persia since before the war and were mostlv employed by Skoda or as railway technicians. About 150 Czechs will remain in Tehran in the employ of Skoda.

Persian Affairs. Political. I HE recent events in Azerbaijan have occupied the Persian Government’s attention to the exclusion of nearly all other business. They are described in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 below. The Majlis. 2. At the session of the 18th November speeches on the situation in Azerbaijan were made by Deputy Dr. Shafaq, the Minister for War and the Minister without Portfolio. The debate on the Minister for War’s Bill was concluded and the Bill was passed by 80 votes out of an attendance of 87. The Tudeh members abstained from voting. For the text of the Bill see Appendix B to this summary. On the 20th November, at a public session following a secret session, a Kurdish Deputy expressed surprise at the announce ment on Radio Paris of the existence of a separatist movement in Kurdistan and reaffirmed the loyalty of the Kurds. A crowd of Azerbaijanis resident in Tehran, said to number 1,000 persons, came to the Majlis, professed their loyalty to the Central Government and asked for permission to go to Azerbaijan to defend their homes against the rebels. On the 21st November there was a secret session. On the 22nd November the Minister of Finance tabled a Bill to provide for the participation of Persia in U.N.R.R.A., and a one-twelfth Budget Bill for the month of Aban (23rd October-21st November). This was passed. 3. On the 17th November the Persian Government addressed a note to the Soviet Embassy in which it stated :•— (i) That a number of Kurds in Azerbaijan and Mahabad had obtained arms from foreign sources to further aims which were at variance with the territorial integrity of Persia. (ii) That the Kurds had obtained a printing press and paper from the U.S.S.R. (iii) That a party of Kurds had visited Baku without completing the usual formalities of passports and exit visas. (iv) That Mulla Mustafa Baizani was allowed by the Russians to foment trouble in Kurdistan. (v) That the Russian authorities exercised a complete control by means of passes and forbade entry into their zone. (vi) That the Russians had stopped the despatch of food-stuffs from their zone to the south, thereby causing a rise in price, losses to merchants and a dislocation of the economic life of Persia. (vii) That maintenance of law and order by the Persian forces had been rendered impossible by the prevention of the despatch of reinforcements. (viii) That a cessation of Government administration had been caused in certain provinces because no governors existed or could be sent. (ix) That the Russians had removed the Persian frontier guards and officials and had thus rendered impossible the prevention of smuggling of live stock, &amp;c. (x) That the Russians had rendered impossible the pursuit of malefactors though they themselves took very speedy action against any person regarded by them as undesirable. (xi) That the Russians had prevented Persian troops from maintaining order or defending themselves in Mianeh on the 17th November and Maragheh on the 26th August and that conversations with the Russian authorities had produced no result. [72—125]The note concludes by saying that if the Russians continue to prevent the despatch of Persian military, gendarmerie or police to areas where they desire to restore law and order, the Persian Government must hold the Russians responsible for any disorders which occur. The substance of this note was given by the Persian Ambassadors in London and Washington to the Foreign Office and State Department respectively, and the Persian Ambassador in Washington, in addition, gave a summary of it to the American press. The Persian Govern- _ ment have now telegraphed*to their ambassador in London to make the contents of the above note available to the British press. 4. At the same time as the above note was presented to the Soviet Embassy the Chief of the General Staff asked the Soviet Military Attache to notify the Soviet military authorities in Qazvin and procure their consent to the despatch of two infantry battalions and a gendarmerie battalion to Mianeh and Tabriz. As no reply was received either to the note or to this request by the General Staff, the latter decided to despatch the force. It left in lorries on the 19th November and the advanced guard reached a point about 40 kilom. from Qazvin, when it was stopped by a Russian staff officer, who said that, if the column went on, it would be fired* at. The officer commanding advanced guard replied that he had received orders to advance even if fired upon and continued to advance. When the advanced guard reached the orchards on the outskirts of Qazvin town it was stopped by one Russian battalion in position across the road with four tanks and two armoured cars. The main body on receiving this information halted at Sharifabad, 7 miles short of Qazvin and about 85 miles from Tehran, and a rear party, halted by Russian troops at Kerej, some 21 miles west of I eh ran, was allowed, after two days, to join the main body and to take its tents and rations of which it had been deprived during two days of incessant ram. 1 he advanced guard subsequently retired to Sharifabad, where the column still remains. The Russians have allowed four of its lorries to make one trip daily to Qazvin to obtain fresh supplies and bread. , 5. Regarding Russian movements in and around Tehran the Lhiet ot the General Staff informed the British Military Attache that (i) Arrivals and departures of Russian troops at and from Tehran by rail during the past twelve days had resulted in an overall increase of some 300. They all carried arms and in some cases carried wooden arms chests and bundles done up in cloth of about 1 metre in length. 1 hese arms have been seen in transit to various Russian military hirings in Tehran, to their military headquarters (still in existence despite their official evacuation of Tehran) and even to the Soviet Embassy. (ii) Persian railway workers belonging to the Tudeh had been armed by the Russians at stations between Semnan and Garmsar (some 40 miles east of Tehran). . „ , , t * (iii) That the Tehran garrison, after the arrival of a battalion trom islahan V and one from Ahwaz, now consisted of twenty battalions. (iv) In his opinion the increases in the Russian garrisons at Semnan and Keren the recent infiltration of Russian troops into Tehran, the bringing in of large quantities of rifles into Tehran by the Russians all pointed to an impending occupation of the capital by Russian troops to coincide with a rising of the local Tudeh and similar risings by the Democrat rebels in Azerbaijan. (The British Military Attache informed the Chief of the General Staff that he did not share this view and that the Russians could obtain their immediate objects without doing so, these objects being to establish a provincial council m Azerbaijan which would bring about autonomy and give them an oil concession.) The Press. 6 . An interesting article signed by eighty “intellectuals has appealed in the paper Bakhtar of the 2nd November. It states that Persia has been occupied by Allied troops for four years and three months, its economic lire has been upset, its currency has been inflated, Allies have interfered with its adminis tration and intervened in its elections, it has not been paid the cost of the military Aid-to-Russia freight carried over its railway, disaffected elements have been encouraged and assisted by the Allies and the despatch of food-stuffs has been prevented. The article contrasts the promises and achievements of the British and Russians in the matter of evacuation and finally asks that British, American and French parliamentary delegations be sent to Azerbaijan to see for themselves whether the present separatist movement is a genuine one or inspired by foreigners.3 A ppointments. *&lt;*• 7 Th ® a PP ointmentofM u r tezaQuliBayat (Foreign Office 47; Military Ailairs 65) as (iCvernor-General of Azerbaijan, which had been announced in the press some weeks ago, has now been confirmed.

Internal Security. A zerhaijan. 10. There is but little definite news from Azerbaijan itself as telegraphic communications have been interrupted and the Persian army’s wireless telegraphy links with Rezaieh, Miandoab, Khoi and Ardebil are not working. The General Officer Commanding at Tabriz is still in touch with Tehran by wireless-telegraphy but can give very scanty information. The intelligence organisation of the Persian General Staff seems very inadequate and ill-trained and incapable of checking the accuracy of any report which it receives. Actually very few fresh events of major importance from the military point of view have occurred in Azerbaijan since those reported in the last Intelligence Summary, and the chief interest centres on Russian military movements around Tehran, on what the Persian Government has done and will do in Tehran vis-d-vis the Russians and what the Persian Government hopes the British and American authorities will do to bring home to the Russians that their present actions are at variance with their undertakings as signatories of the Tripartite Treaty. 11 . On the 14th November the Democratic party of Azerbaijan announced in the press that the “ first phase of their organisation ” was complete, i.e., that the Tabriz Committee and those in the smaller towns were in being, and that the second phase, that of organisation of village councils, would begin. About the same time it was announced that the party had decided to ignore the decision of the Tehran Government to postpone the Majlis elections and that Azerbaijan, under the leadership of the Democratic party, would proceed with the elections both of the Majlis and of the provincial and town councils. 12. From information obtained from the Chief of General Staff and from consular sources the situation, in brief, appears to be as follows : Tabriz. —The town is quiet but apprehensive of future offensive action by the Russians or the Democrat party, action which the Persian military are probably incapable of resisting. The General Officer Commanding is in touch with the Persian General Staff by wireless. Telegraphic com munications between Tabriz and Zenjan, Tabriz and Rezaieh, Tabriz and Astara, Tabriz and Kermanshah interrupted. Many merchants are leaving for Tehran. The Democratic party has patrols checking all civilian move ment and preventing all Persian military, gendarmerie and police movement on all roads leading out of Tabriz. Rezaieh. —Believed to be quiet, but no wireless communication exists. Khoi. Believed to be quiet, but no wireless communication exists. Azarshahr and Ajabshahr.—32 and 50 miles respectively south-west of Tabriz, gendarme posts overpowered by Democrat rebels. Maraqheh. —Persian Army garrison of one company, confined to barracks and town in hands of rebels. Two thousand rifles said to have been distributed by the Russians to the rebels. [72—125] B 24 Miandoab. —According consular report, believed to be in rebels’ hands, but Chief of General Staff believes that the Persian Army garrison of one battalion is still in control of the town. Sarah. —In rebel hands, the garrison of one platoon having been disarmed and made prisoner. . Ardebil. —No communication by wireless, but Chief of General Staff believes the garrison of one battalion to be safe though not in command of the situation. Eight thousand rifles said to have been distributed to Democrats by the Russians. Mianeh. —In rebel hands—two lorry loads of rifles said to have been distributed by the Russians. Pickets of Muhajirs,” Russian speaking and of a military bearing, control all movement between Tabriz and Mianeh. Gendarmerie Posts. —Most of these are said to have been disarmed and captured. There are none remaining between Tabriz and Mianeh. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz sums up by saying that, while reports of fighting have been much exaggerated, the Democratic party really mean business. The Central Government has no authority whatsoever between Mianeh and Tabriz, and the Democratic party is in control in every town and village of eastern Azerbaijan. A clear sweep has been made of the gendarmerie and the opportunity has been taken to liquidate a number of landlords obnoxious to the Democrats. What has happened in Mianeh will happen on a bigger scale during the next week in Tabriz and an autonomous Azerbaijan will have come into being. 13. The People’s Congress has distributed a French translation of their manifesto to foreign consuls in Tabriz. The document is reproduced as Appendix A to this summary. i ^ „ T ^ 14. Corrigendum (reference paragraph 7 of last Intelligence Summary).—lo the list of communities actively carrying out Russian designs in Azerbaijan should of course, be added certain Kurdish elements (chiefly Shakkak and Herki) and “ muhajirs ” imported from the U.S.S.R. That some Persian Azerbaijanis support the'Democrat party is not denied, but the paragraph referred to was designed to show that minorities, disaffected tribal elements and immigrants form the badkbone of the party. British Interests. 15 Dr. Mortimer Wheeler, Director-General of Archaeology in India, arrived in Persia via Zahidan on the 26th October for a four weeks’ tour of Persia under the auspices of the Indo-Iranian Cultural Society. He visited Isfahan, Shiraz and Persepolis, but was not permitted by the Russians to proceed to Meshed via Gunbad-i-Qabus, or even to travel to Meshed by the direct route by air. The party returned to India via Baghdad. American Interests. 16. Having sold their railway locomotives and 277 of their oil tank waggons for the highly satisfactory figure of 85 per cent, of their cost, the Americans aie considering the sale of their remaining assets on the basis of per cent, of their original cost. It is proposed to include m this sale, but not on the per cent, basis, the remaining 184 tank waggons which the Americans have for disposal. The American proposal would result in a satisfactory o\ erall percentage, particularly as the buildings and camps, which form the major part of these assets, would fetch very little in the open market. It would, however, adyei sel&gt; affect British military disposals if the British were obliged to adopt a similaL‘ figure, firstly because the British have not 1 cashed in on any items comparable to the American railway assets and, secondly, because they still have for disposal some valuable material chiefly in the form of harbour installations. Russian Interests. 17. An A.I.O.C. source in Tabriz considered reliable reports the erection of an oil drilling rig by the Russians at a hamlet Sennikh (not marked on the map), some 15 miles from Tabriz on the Tabriz-Marand road. 18. The Moscow press has given prominence to events in Azerbaijan where, it asserts, genuine democratic and labour movements are being harshly repressed by Persian military and gendarmerie. It accuses the B.B.C. of falsifying news of the recent events in order to divert world attention from the discreditab,* happenings in Palestine and Indonesia. Tehran, 2bth November, 1945.0 Attirant enfin Tattention du Gouvernement iranien et des Puissances democratiques du monde sur les questions susmentionnees, le Congres declare ne vouloir employer que des moyens de propagande et d’organisation pour arriver a ses buts pacifiquement et ne permettre en aucune fa^on ni dispute ni guerre interieure a moins que le Gouvernement central ne veuille pi^tiner ses droits legitimes par contrainte et force armee. Dans ce cas, il defendra ses droits a tout prix et combattra jusqu’a la derniere personne pour imposer enfin son autonomie nationale coute que coute. L’Assemble constitutionnelle a done donn£ carte blanche au “ Comite national ” d’entrer en pourparlers avec les autorites competentes pour assurei Tautonomie d’Azerbaidjan et d’en obtenir la solution pacifiquement; mais le “ Comite national ’ ’ ne peut en aucune fagon passer outre des droits de I’autonomie regionale et du Gouvernement national, ni faire quoi que ce soit contre 1’integrity territoriale et I’independance de I’lran. Nous voudrions que le monde democrate sache qu’il existe un peuple sur le globe qui s’est prepare a defendre ses droits de tout son pouvoir pour dresser le pavilion de la liberte sur un coin de TAsie et qu’il est decide d’assurer son autonomie par son energie nationale et nous esperons que les autorites competentes iraniennes et les Puissances democratiques de 1’univers ne nous epargneront pas leur gracieux concours dans la realisation de notre but national, qui est base, du reste, sur le Pacte de I’Atlantique. Avec ses considerations distinguees : La Direction du Congres national (Assemblee constitutionnelle nationale) de 1’Azerbaidjan. (Seal.) Appendix B. The following is the text of the Ministry of War Bill passed by the Majlis oil the 18th November, 1945 :— 1 Single article : “ The Majlis shall authorise the Ministry of Finance to provide the following credits in addition to the Ministry of War’s present budget and to pay them to that Ministry. (i) The Ministry of War shall be authorised to add 12,132 men to the present army strength, for which the budget for the last four months of the year, amounting to approximately 52 million rials, shall be paid by the Ministry of Finance.

[E 9871/70/34] Copy No. 1^0 Military Attache's Intelligence Summary No. 46, Secret, for the Period 26£A November to 3rd December, 1945.— ^(Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 427 of 4:th December, 1945; Received in Foreign Office 18^ December.) Persian Affairs. AFFAIRS in Azerbaijan have monopolised the attention of the Persian Government during the past week. The Persian Government anxiously awaits the reply of the Soviet Government to the notes presented by the American and British Ambassadors. The Soviet Embassy’s reply to the Persian Government’s note of the 17th November (see paragraph 3 of last Intelligence Summary) is reproduced as an appendix to this summary. It will be seen that the Russians flatly deny all charges brought against them and bring counter-charges against the Persian Government. Over the most important question, that of the despatch of Persian troops, the Russians give no satisfaction but throw the onus of respon sibility on to the shoulders of the Persians, adding the threat that any Persian troop movements will necessitate an increase in Russian garrisons. The Russian argument, if such it can be called, depends on two false assumptions, viz., firstly, that the existing Persian garrison of Azerbaijan—some 4,000 effectives out of a total of 6 , 000 —even if reinforced by two battalions and a battalion of gendarmerie, could possibly constitute a menace to Russian forces totalling at least 30,000 men, and, secondly, that the existing garrisons are, in fact, garrisons. The gendarmerie throughout the province are known to have been disarmed and the military are either restricted in action to an area within 5 miles of their barracks, as at Rezaieh, or confined to barracks as at Maragheh, or besieged in their barracks as at Miandoab, or allowed to perform static guards under Russian surveillance as at Tabriz. The one thing they are*not allowed to do is to take action against Democrat rebels when disturbing the peace. Such action brings instant intervention by the local Russian town major, who orders the Persian troops back to barracks and liberates anyone made prisoner by them. 2. On the 22nd November the Persian Government addressed a second note to the Soviet Embassy, in which it protested against the continued presence of Russian troops in Tehran after the town had been declared officially as evacuated by them. The note also protested against the introduction into the capital of refugees in plain clothes. 3. The speeches of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Eden in the House of Commons have greatly heartened Persians of all classes. 4. The Russian military have evacuated their military movements staff and all troops from Tehran railway station and are said to have established them near Firuzkuh. They have also evacuated their military headquarters (which has gone to join its parent body at Qazvin), and some, but not all, of their billets. They still have a camp some 5 kilom. west of the town. 5 . The Persian Government has addressed a note to His Majesty’s Embassy asking that an invitation be procured for the Persian Government to attend the International Conference on War Indemnities now in session in Paris, on the grounds that Persia has been at war with Germany and has thereby suffered many direct and indirect losses. The Majlis. 6 . On the 25th and 28th November the Majlis Budget Commission met to discuss the 4-12ths Budget Bill recently tabled by the Minister of Finance. The Minister of the Interior made a short speech, mainly about the departure of Bayat, the newly-appointed Governor-General for Azerbaijan. The urgency of the Peasants’ Insurance Bill was discussed, but there were insufficient Deputies present for a division. The urgency of the Justice Commission (Powers) Bill was also discussed but no decision was taken. In view of the developments in Azerbaijan a secret session of the Majlis was held on the 26th November, at which [72—126]the Prime Minister informed the House of the steps he had taken during the past few days. At a secret session of the Majlis on the 27th November it was decided to appoint a commission of sixteen members appointed from all the Majlis groups, to study the recent events in Azerbaijan and the decisions taken by the Govern ment, and to keep in constant touch with the Government. MaJlik Madani and Niqabat were appointed to represent the Mihan group; Iskandari and Farmanfarmayan the Azadi group; Shari’ Atzadeh and Hismati the Ittihad-i- Melli group; Siqat-ul-Islami and Samsam the Democrats (no connexion with- the Azerbaijan Democrats); Dr. Kishavarz and Shahab the Tudeh; Mas’udi and Dr. ’Abduh the Mustaqil group, and Dr. Musaddiq and Dr. Shafaq the Independents. The commission met for the first time on the 28th November. Internal Security. Azerbaijan (see paragraph 12 of last Intelligence Summary). 7. Events which have occurred since the last Intelligence Summary was written are as follows :— Maragheh. —The Governor has been shot by Democrat rebels. Astara. —This place has been seized by the rebels who shot the Persian frontier commissar and then marched down the Caspian coast as far as Shifarud (some 25 miles short of Pahlevi). Mianeh. —No change. The rebel garrison is believed to number 250. Zenjan. —^This place, though not in Azerbaijan, has been occupied by the rebels. The rebel garrison is believed to number 200. Tabnz-Zenjan Road. —Some 300 rebels are distributed in pickets along the road. They control all movement and search vehicles and travellers. Nir {near Sarah ).—A party of Shahsevan tribesmen came to the rescue of Sardar Nusrat, their chief, who was besieged by rebels. The Shahsevan defeated the rebels and rescued their chief, killing fifty-seven rebels and recovering a number of rifles. Qazvin. —Tudeh or Democrat pickets reported (requires confirmation) to be in charge of all exits from the town and to be preventing the transit of all food-stuffs. Miandoab. —The garrison of one Persian battalion is still intact though besieged in its barracks. It has succeeded in establishing contact by messenger with the Persian garrison of Saqqiz. Saqqiz. —The garrison has despatched two companies on detachment to Tikab, some 70 miles north-east of Saqqiz, to prevent any southward move ment of the rebels towards Bijar and Hamadan. Khorasan. 8 . A consular source reports that the arrival of a party of Tudeh leaders in Meshed is causing the local authorities some alarm. They feel they can control the local leaders but fear that newcomers, possibly followed by bands of “ muhajirs,” may be more difficult to deal with. 9. Ten lorry loads of arms and ammunition sent from Tehran for the Persian military garrison in Meshed are reported to have been detained en route by the Russian military authorities. 10 . The same source reports that the survivors of the Meshed mutineers, after having been in hiding with the Turcomans at Gavash Teppe near Gunbad- i-Qabus for some time, have now joined the Azerbaijan Democrat rebels. Persian Army. 11 . Reinforcements, amounting to a battalion in each case, have been brought to Tehran from Shiraz, Isfahan, Khuzistan and Khurramabad. 12 . During the past week there has been some activity, mostly from the Tudeh members, designed to displace General Arfa, the Chief of General Staff, as being obnoxious to the Russians. Several prominent Deputies have represented to the Prime Minister and the president of the Majlis the unwisdom of such a change during the present crisis, the Prime Minister is believed to have agreed with their views. A jyp ointments. 13. (i) Abul Qasim Najm, Minister for Foreign Affairs designate, has arrived in Tehran from Kabul. (ii) Bayat, the newly-appointed Governor-General of Azerbaijan, has arrived in Tabriz by Russian plane.3 (iii) Mubasir Roshani has been appointed Deputy Governor-General of Azerbaijan and Governor of Tabriz.

The United States Air Attache, who returned from Tabriz last week, reports that he saw twenty-seven 1 L 2 Stornovik 2 -seater machines under covers on the Tabriz aerodrome and eight fighters at Qazvin. He considers that the Russians are doing very little flying of any sort. British Interests. 16.

Translation of Russian Embassy Memorandum of the 26^- November, 1945, handed to the Second Political Department of the Ministry for Foreiqn Affairs, at 10-30 a.m., the 26^ November, 1945. THE Soviet Embassy present their compliments to the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and in reply to Mbmorandum, dated the 17th November, 1945, have the honour to state that the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Soviet officials are interfering in the internal affairs of Iran is unfounded and is not consistent with the actual facts. Likewise, the question of Soviet authorities rendering assistance to the Kurds in their political activities in those areas is completely unfounded, and in particular they have had no con nexion with the activities of the Kurdish tribal chiefs living in the 4th Ustan (Mahabad), nor did they have anything to do with Mulla Mustafa Barzan’s crossing the Irano-Iraq frontier as alleged in the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ memorandum. It is clear in the mind of the Soviet Embassy that the Soviet representatives did not, as alleged in the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ memorandum, request the release of any of those people detained by the gendarmerie at Quli Kundi, nor is there any question of Persian military guards, who were proceeding towards the prison building in Tabriz, being detained by the Soviet authorities. To confirm that Soviet authorities prevent the passage of Persian subjects in the northern provinces would not be consistent with the true facts; it is obvious that the Soviet system of issuing passes for travelling to the northern provinces of Persia, where Soviet forces are stationed, applies to subjects of other countries. The statement made in the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ memorandum that Soviet officials are interfering in the economic life of the northern provinces is unfounded; it is clear, on the other hand, that the So\iet Go\ernment, in accordance 5 with its duty of friendship, rendered assistance to Persia in Miay 1943 at the most difficult of times even for the Soviet Government, by providing 25,000 tons of wheat for the populace of the capital of Persia—'Tehran. By importing other Soviet goods Soviet commercial organisations during the war irnDroved the distribution of goods for the Persian people. * It is obvious that the Soviet Government cannot be held responsible tor the absence of Governors-General and other Government officials in the not them provinces As regards the departure of such officials to the places of then appointment the Soviet transport organisation have in this respect, always assisted the Persian Government; only a few days ago the Soviet Embassy proved their assistance by providing a plane for the departure of M. Bayat to Tabriz. Without giving it much consideration the Ministry for Foreign Affans raised the question of protecting the Persian-Turkish borders; the relevant Persian authorities repeatedly informed the Soviet officials that the establishment of4 frontier posts on the Persian-Turkish border present great difficulties for them and in spite of repeated proposals by Soviet officials in this respect they have refused to protect this frontier. Under these circumstances the objections raised by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs about the absence of gendarmerie posts on the Persian-Turkish border cannot be considered relevant. The statement to the effect that Soviet authorities appear to have interfered in the judicial affairs of Persians and to have prevented the enforcement of they«w penal code with regard to Persian subjects is very surprising in view of there - being no foundation for such a statement and its inconsistency with the actual facts, and it cannot be ignored that local Persian officials have repeatedly created obstacles in the unearthing of treacherous elements and local judges have repeatedly exonerated such elements or have purposely issued light sentences for persons disturbing public order in the areas where Soviet troops are stationed and for persons stealing Soviet military property and even for the murderers of Soviet military officials. In spite of this the Soviet military officials did not have recourse to interference in the judicial proceedings in Persia, but desired the protection of the interest of Soviet nationals and institutions in accordance with the current laws of Persia, and it is obvious that Soviet otticiaJs could not overlook the methods of investigation and trial adopted by the Persian officials with regard to Persian subjects who committed important crimes against certain Soviet officials and military personnel. However, this can in no way be considered as interference in the judicial affairs of Persia. ' , Activities on the part of certain Persian political parties in the northern provinces, such as the incidents which took place in Mianeh and Maragheh, were referred to in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs’ memorandum, which connected such activities with the Democratic party of Persian Azerbaijan. Information received by the Soviet Embassy does not confirm the questions brought up in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs’ memorandum. In any case, the incidents in the northern provinces of Persia which are connected with the activities of political parties constitute in fact Persian internal problems. Soviet officials and military authorities have not interfered and do not interfere in the political life of the northern provinces. Therefore the Soviet Embassy strongly rejects the efforts to transfer responsibility for these incidents from the Persian to the Soviet authorities, who have in no way interfered in these incidents. Since the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, to support its statements, thought it necessary to appeal to the Tripartite Pact, the Soviet Embassy is obliged to state that the above-mentioned pact, dated 1942, is fully and carefully observed by the Soviets. At the same time, the Soviet Embassy is obliged t 6 point out that the section of the above-mentioned pact connected with the maintenance of security inside Persia is often not observed by Persian officials; the behaviour of certain members of military and gendarmerie groups has not been consistent with the establish ment of security in the areas of their appointment. This matter was duly men tioned in memorandum of the 20th August, 1944, and in subsequent correspondence from the Soviet Embassy. Information in the hands of the Soviet Embassy bears witness that recently certain gendarmerie officials have not only failed to render any help in establishing security and order in the northern provinces, but have very often been responsible by their own behaviour for undesirable incidents between local residents. In connexion with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs’ statement concerning the entry of military reinforcements to the northern provinces, the Soviet Embassy would draw that Ministry’s atten tion to the following points. Taking into consideration the fact that any undesirable incidents must be avoided in the interests of both the Persian and the Russian Governments, and the fact that this question is connected with the entry of new Persian troops into the northern provinces of Persia, the Soviet Government does not deem the entry of such troops at the present moment to be expedient, and it must be taken into consideration that if any new forces, in addition to the regular Persian army and gendarmerie stationed in these districts, should enter these areas, then such ^action would lead to disturbances and blood shed in the northern provinces of Persia. The Soviet Government would then be obliged, for the maintenance of the security of the Soviet garrison, to bring in new reinforcements of their own. As the Soviet Government does not desire to bring reinforcements into Persia, does not. therefore, deem it expedient for Persian military reinforcements to enter the northern provinces of Persia. x^1 ' C/ ^ CG ^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HlS B LC MAJESSP^q G (^fiR&amp;yfeb*6 opSECRET £'f~no}oT+s.

Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 436 of ll£A December.—(Received in Foreign Office ‘list December.) Persian Affairs. Political. 1 . The Persian, though capable of spasmodic feats of bravery, is not renowned for that dogged brand of courage which sustains prolonged resistance in adverse circumstances. His vanity leads him to think that his vital interests must be those of the entire world. He is ignorant of how democracies work and how they conduct their diplomatic business. He was dismayed that approaches made to the Soviet Government by the British and American Governments did not immediately elicit favourable replies. All these factors have combined to cast a gloom over political circles and it is not surprising that the Persian’s courage is beginning to ooze away. The Majlis majority behind the Prime Minister, seeing no immediate or tangible results from his policy of resistance, have begun to waver and the minority, led by Dr. Musaddiq, with their policy of appeasement began to gain ground. Supporters of the Qawam-us-Saltaneh began to lobby on his behalf and some forty-five Deputies are believed to have signed a document pledging their support of him. His policy, of which he makes no secret, is that of appeasement in general and, in particular, that of granting the Russians an oil concession, agreeing to hold the elections on the original date and the removal of officials obnoxious to the Russians. Like most Persians, he is obsessed with the idea of his own cleverness and thinks that, if he were to come into power, he could by prevarication and procrastination keep the Russians dangling on the end of a string until the 2nd March—a belief which few outside the ranks of his country men would share. The recent news of the forthcoming meeting of the three Foreign Secretaries in Moscow has slightly diminished this gloom and given the Persians a ray of hope that their problem may yet be settled. 2. The Cabinet is said to be considering the idea of asking the three Big Powers, and possibly France and China in addition, to supervise the next elections so as to refute the Russian accusation that the Persian Government is reactionary. 3. The Soviet Embassy’s reply to the Persian Government’s note of the 22nd November (see paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary) merely referred to the Persian Government to the Soviet Embassy’s reply of the 26th November (see appendix to last Intelligence Summary) to which it had nothing to add. A further note by the Persian Government dated the 4th December has not yet been answered. 4. On the 26th November the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty’s Embassy a memorandum of which copies had been sent to the Soviet, American, French and Chinese Embassies in Tehran. This is reproduced as an appendix to this Intelligence Summary. The Majlis. 5. At the sessions of the 2nd, 4th and 6 th December the attention of Deputies was almost entirely devoted to events in Azerbaijan. The only Majlis business conducted was a discussion of the Prison Reform Law at the request of the Minister for Justice and the tabling by the Minister of Finance of the Income Tax Amendment Bill. Internal Security. Azerbaijan. 6 . There is a change for the worse in the situation as reported in para graph 7 of last Intelligence Summary. News from some places, because it concerns Democrat activities, is given in this paragraph for the sake of convenience even though these places are outside the boundaries of Azerbaijan. Bayat, the newly-arrived Governor-General, issued a proclamation on the 3rd DecemberI 2 addressed to the people of the province. No mention of the autonomists was made and he expressed his. readiness to enter into negotiations with representatives of all classes and sfrata of the population. He admitted the urgent need for reforms throughout Persia and, in particular, in Azerbaijan. He deprecated attempts to secure these reforms by violence and murder. He stated that he had instructed the police to maintain law and order and appealed to all Azerbaijanis to co-operate in this task. According to reports received, the Democrats have so far ignored Bayat’s approaches. Voting for the National Parliament ended on the 2nd December. A Democrat paper has warned the Persian army that the first shot fired by them will be the signal for battle betweeti the Democrats and the army. News from the various centres is as follows :— Tabriz. —A police officer was murdered by the rebels outside his office about a week ago and another was murdered on the 8 th December by five Caucasians in civilian dress who subsequently fled to a Russian military billet. The effect on the Tabriz garrison’s morale is said to be bad as the officers feel that they will be slaughtered one by one while Russians look on and render them powerless to resist. The Chief of the General Staff is of the opinion that matters are coming to a head in Tabriz and that the rebels wdll soon begin attacks on public buildings and the garrison in order to present a fait accompli to the Moscow Conference when it meets. Maragheh. —No accurate information but a report from the General- Officer-Commanding Tabriz Division states that, after murdering the governor, the rebels have left the town. Astara and Caspian Coast .—No change. Mianeh. —No change. Zenjan .—The governor is reported to be a prisoner in the hands of the rebels who are holding him as a hostage for two of their number who had been arrested and removed to Tehran some weeks ago. The Democrat leader, Dr. Jehanshadlu, has assumed the duties of governor and is issuing orders in the town. Tabriz-Zenjan Road. —No change but see paragraph 12 below. Qazvin. —Ffom the Persian press and from another source comes the news that the governor has succeeded in persuading the Tudeh pickets to permit the passage to Tehran of food-stuffs in transit. Miandoab .—No change. Marand .—This place, about midway between Tabriz and Julfa is mwv in rebel hands. They shot three prominent landlords. Sarab. —Confirmation from tw^o sources has now been received of a report heard as long as ten days ago to the effect that after the military garrison of one platoon had been overpowered, disarmed and taken prisoner by the rebels, two officers and twenty-one men of the gendarmerie were taken outside the town and murdered in cold blood. Shahin Dej (previously known as Sain Qaleh). —The rebels who hold Bukan have mwv penetrated as far as this place which is some fifty miles north-east of Saqqiz where there is a strong military garrison. Babulsar in Mazanderan is reported as being in Tudeh hands, and in Mazanderan and Gilan in general Tudeh activities have much increased. A no rent campaign has been successfully launched among the peasants by the Tudeh. Kerej. The Russians have posted a strong picket on the main Tehran- Kerej road about twenty miles west of Tehran. In Tehran itself the town is quiet and the military forces are adequate to deal with any outbreak unless the rioters are reinforced from outside On the 8 th December four lorries, driven by Russian soldiers, deposited at a Russian billet a total of about 100 Caucasians in civilian clothes Isfahan. 7. The movement against Muiteza Quli Ivhan has flared up a^ain and three Bakhtiari Khans of the rival faction have been trying to stir up trouble in Chahar Mahal. A summons to return to Isfahan issued by the General-Officer- Commanding Isfahan Division has, so far, prevented the trouble spreading. t ars. . have recently been made to compose the differences between the Aasir Khan and An Khan branches of the Qashgai family. Nasir Khan is3 reported to have offered to All Khan a monthly allowance of 30,000 rials. The latter has not yet accepted this offer and would prefer a gift of land or, more accurately speaking, the just restoration of lands previously his. The acceptance of a monthly allowance, he feels, would brand him as Nasir’s paid servant and diminish his prestige. It might also damage his reputation in the eyes of the Persian Government if, in the event of any future misconduct on Nasir Khan’s part, he was thought to be Nasir’s paid accomplice. A j)y ointments. 0- (i) Muhammad Nariman, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, has been appointed Mayor of Tehran in addition to his other duties. The sudden dismissal of Ghulam Husein Ibtehaj (F.O. 89, M.A.117) is believed to be due to pressure by the Russians with whom he was highly unpopular on account of his firm attitude to Tudeh agitators, (ii) Abul Qasim Kahalzadeh to be Director of the Propaganda Depart ment. (There is no information as to the previous career of this obscure individual.) British Interests. 10. A statement in some Persian newspapers to the effect that large British reinforcements had been landed in South Persia was officially denied in the Daily News Bulletin. One newspaper came out with the fantastic story that several British battleships had arrived in the Shatt el Arab. 11 . The British military authorities propose to hand over to the Persian Government on varying dates between the 11 th and 22 nd December the following :— Kerman aerodrome, Kerman-Zahidan road, Zahidan-Mirjawa road, Zahidan aerodrome, British military buildings in Zahidan. 12. The British Embassy courier van was stopped on its way to Tabriz on the 4th December at Zenj an by a picket of Democrat rebels. The driver showed his Russian pass but the picket insisted on examining the contents of the truck and even demanded that he open the various packages. This the driver refused to do but could not prevent the picket from entering the truck and seeing what there was. The driver was obliged to drive to a garage while the rebels took a decision. Eventually two Russian officers arrived and, after explanations by the driver, they told the rebels that the truck should be allowed to proceed. A merican Interests. 13. EMfounded rumours published in some Persian newspapers, to the effect that large American military reinforcements had arrived in Tehran, produced an official denial from the American Embassy. The rumour was probably caused by the arrival of a draft of some 200 service personnel as guards for the American camp at Amirabad to relieve a similar number of men due for discharge. Russian Interests. 14^ About a week ago local Armenian newspapers published an announce ment by Moscow Radio to the effect that the Council of National Representatives in Moscow, in view of the numerous petitions received from Armenians resident abroad, had acceded to the request of the Government of Soviet Armenia that the gates of the Soviet Armenian Republic be thrown open to Armenians wishing to immigrate. They would be granted free customs entry and advances of money to build houses up to 50 per cent, of the cost. Since then small crowds of Armenians have been seen daily outside the Soviet Consulate-General in Tehran. In April 1945 some propaganda to the same effect by the Archimandrite of Julfa (Isfahan) was reported in the Military Attache’s Intelligence Summary. 15. Reference paragraph 15 of Intelligence Summary No. 26, dated the 8 th July, 1945, the Under-Secretary for War gave the British Military Attache some additional information about the losses incurred over the contract for supplying the Russians with arms and ammunition from the arsenal. The revised figures are as follows :— (i) Deliveries to Russians. 41,950 Brno rifles at 910 rials each, though the cost price to the Persian Government was 2,062 rials. 10,282 machine pistols at 710 rials each, though the cost price to the Persian Government was 2,840 rials. [72—127] B 24 8,623,000 cartridges at 1-46 rials each, though the cost price to the Persian Government was 3 • 40 rials. 600,000 ramrods, for which no charge was made. 415 series of spare parts for machine pistols, for which no charge was made. (ii) Payments by Russians. The Russians have paid :— 10,000,000 rials to the Persian Government. 2,500,000 rials to Skoda. 1,800,000 rials to Iran-Sovtrans for transport. 5,000,000 rials as an initial advance to the Persian Government. (iii) At the same time the Russians are making unspecified claims for materials and tools furnished by them for the manufacturing, in addition to 7,200,000 rials due in salaries to Russian specialists experts and advisers. (iv) Ihe Russians proposed to settle by giving the Persian Government 262,191 metric tons of steel. It is estimated that this would settle Russia’s debt for the above material if calculated on the basis of $4,000 per metric ton. (v) Persian Government claim that, even if settlement as at (iv) is made (the matter is still under discussion as the Russians say “they await instructions from Moscow ’’) they have lost on the deal 86,485,772 rials. Polish Interests. 16. The movement of Polish refugees to the Lebanon has been in progress for some weeks. Isfahan is now clear of Poles and the numbers in Tehran°and Ahwaz as at the 8 th December was as follows :— Tehran Ahwaz Men. Women 159 442 44 624 203 1,066 Children.

Tehran, Stth December, 1945. Appendix. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs to His Britannic Majesty's Embassy. (No. 5624.) Memorandum, Tehran, 26£A November, 1945. Thy Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty s Lmbassy, and have the honour to state that:— As the embassy are aware, a limited number of people have had recourse to certain measures in the Ustans 3 and 4 of Azerbaijan, raised certain undesirable voices and even issued a proclamation in support of their statements with the result that they have created a situation which entirely violates the Oro-anic Law and which is against the security, peace and tranquillity of the country. Chaos and disorder is increasingly widening. In many places these elements have attacked security officials, have occupied many towns and are interferino- on the roads and disturbing traffic security. As a result the Central Government have owing to interruption of the telegraphic and telephonic communications, no true information as to the situation of their officials in these Ustans, and cannot send necessary instructions to the officials concerned in a proper manner and be confident that these instructions will be carried out.5 The Government s views are that if every individual, group or community m c °untiy has any allegations to make, which are not of a rebellious nature, against the Gentral Government and the Organic Law, then such legitimate allegations will be examined and peace and tranquillity established in every district. At the same time the Government is compelled to restore security in face of such elements who may have recourse to certain measures against the prestige and honour of the country, to take certain fundamental measures in order to establish and maintain the power of the Central Government throughout the country in the interests of public welfare. The expec tations of the Imperial Government, while taking into view the friendship and good relations existing between herself and her agreeable Allies, particularly in view of the guarantees given in the proclamation issued by the leaders of the three Powers in Tehran and signed by Roosevelt, Stalin and Mr. Churchill, are that the Allied Powers, whose military forces are still in this country, without having the right to interfere in the internal affairs of the country, should express their views about the measures and action taken by the Central legal (jovernment and inform the Imperial Government of the nature of any recommendations which they may have to make for the restoration of security in those Ustans. It is evident that they should also take into view the fact that the Government, with a view to maintaining security and assuring peace and tranquillity of the public, will have to utilise the security forces of the country by sending a sufficient number of them as reinforcements to wherever this be found necessary. The Imperial Government’s forces should enjoy freedom of action inside the country in order to be able to stop the activities of the rebellious elements and to restore security in the places involved. As they seem to intend to take certain measures shortly in the Ustans 3 and 4 which would be against Organic Law, it is desirable that they should bear in mind that the matter is of great importance and urgency, and the Persian Government therefore request that the relevant authorities of the friendly and Allied Governments may give immediate instructions to quarters they deem expedient to extend the required assistance and co-operation. A copy of this memorandum has been sent to the Embassies of the U.S.S.R. and the United States in Tehran. A copy has also been sent to the Embassy of the Provisional French Government and a copy to the Chinese Embassy in Tehran. (Sealed) Ministry for Foreign Affairs. VBritish Embassy, TEHRAN.

The first round has gone to the rebels and, for the time being at least, Azerbaijan is in the Russian bag,. 2 Meanwhile, in Tehran, certain actions by the Prime ''inister have tended to estrange still further the Majlis Majority which supported him. These actions are four in number. Firstly the Prime Minister refuses to take the Majlis sufficiently into his confidence and, in reply to numerous questions, merely replies that active steps to end the deadlock are being taken. Even the cabinet would appear not to have been consulted in some of his decisions. Secondly he has convened a ’high council' of elder statesmen. That this council is entirely unofficial has been stressed but, all the same, their reputations and political leanings do not inspire confidence among the advocates of resistance. The Qawam-us-Saltaneh, who has vast estates in the I ussian zone and whose candidature for the Premiership the Russian controlled press has long been advocating, makes no secret' of his belief in a policy of appeasement in general and, in particular, of granting an oil concession to the Russians, of removi-ng, x^^ioials obnoxious to -tho Russians and in holding the elections, for the next Majlis on thu original of the postponed date. Mushtashfiuvud-Dowleh is a tool of the Tudeh and -closely related to the leader of the rebels v/ho staged the disturhanres in Zenjan. Ali Mansur (Mansur-us-Saltan^h),though intelligent and able, has a dubious record'as Governor-General in Meshed where H.M. Consul-General recently described him as- 'either the Retain or the Quisling of Khorasan'. Pirnia, though honest, is far advanced in senility. Baha-ul-Mulk Qaragazlu is inept and foolish. It was inevitable that the selection of such men by the ^rime Minister as his unofficial advisers should arouse mistrust. Thirdly, without informing H. I.M.The Shah or the British or American Ambassadors, the Prime Minister has suggested to the Soviet Government through the Persian Ambassador in Moscov/ that he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs .should go to Moscow 'for converse.tions'. The possible consequences of this are obvious and would provide justification for the Russian view, so often expressed in the Moscow press and in the Russian controlled Persian press, that the Azerbaijan affair is a domestic one between Russia and Persia and should hot be raised to the status of an international issue. Realizing how greatly this direct approach will have weakened the position of the British and American Secretaries of State, H.I.M.The Shah prevailed upon the ^rime Minister to retrieve his mistake, as far as-possible, by making a public appeal to the three powers to remove their troops from Persia immediately and by addressing a request to the three governments that Persia should be represented, in virtue of Article 6 of the Tripartite Treaty, at any discussions in Moscow affecting Persia. Fourthly, in his desire to avoid any action provocative to the Russians, the Prime Minister, against the advice- 2 - of tho Chief of the General Staff, despatched a telegram to the garrison at Tabriz ««* :iV ^ring them to resist in principle (whatever that may mean), ordering the oflxcers to disband the soldiers, to destroy their arms and make their way to Tehran. 3 . t hile Persians continue to pin their faith to a successful outcome of the Moscow conference, there are few who regard the recent Jussian success in Azerbaijan as the limit of their aims in Persia* That the Tudeh movements in Gilan, Mazanderan and Khorasan will follow suit is their conviction while the truly pessimistic aver that all these are but first steps to a Russian domination of the -whole country, their acquisition of a warm water port on the Persian Gulf, their seizure of the Khuxistan oil and severance of Britain’s communications between the Near Bast and India. The Majlis. i f# Apart from speeches on the Azerbaijan situation the only noteworthy proceeding has been the continuation of the debate on the Income Tax Law (Amendment) Bill. Legislation. 5 . The cabinet have decreed that, as from December 5fh, the import and exoort of Persian currency notes will be strictlyforbiddon. Travellers will be allowed to bring in or take out Persian currency to the value of one thousand rials (about £7-10-0). Rials in excess of this will be confiscated and offenders will be prosecuted. The Government are preprring a bill amending the Provincial Councils Law v/hich was passed 40 years ago, since the duties and powers of such Councils as laid down in the old law do not correspond with- the present cay needs, . j^raatry of the Interior have prepared a seventy article bill which vn 11 snorj^y - ^ in the Majlis. This bill, if passed, will probably take instead of merely amending it. The new bill is reportoe to conn o p Provincial Councils, the methods by which the Councils will ^ „ of capital town of each Ustan to have twelve representatives and each shahristan ot the nr evince to be represented by one member, all meeting m the capi , to province to form to Council! Independent 'shahristans' like Qazvxn and Arak will be represented at the capital town of each Ustan by six representatives, and to 'districts' of such independent 'shahristans' by one representative. INTERNAL SECURI TY*, Azerbaijan. 7 Bayat, the Governor-General, has returned to Tehran as to Democrats had broken of/relations with him on the grounds that their plans haa alreaay be n made and could nut now be modified. 8 # The elections for the Tabriz deputies to the Azerbaijan National Council h n ve been concluded. The provincial results are not yet to hand. Th r were in all 47 candidates for 12 seats. The 'successful- candidates all obtained fVnm ?1 000 to 23 000 votes while none of the others receivea as many c - s 50* poU is 'headed by Pishlvari who was elected Wo years ago as a Tudeh candidate to the ' rilis from Tabriz but who had his credentials rejected. xhe second is Biriya a p!omtont labour agitator educated in Baku. The tenth, Ipekchian, is a Tudeh member of the present Majlis. The eleventh, Kashinji, was an unsuccessful Russian candidate for to Majlis. Among the general populace the attitoe t° the elections seems to have been one of indifference amounting to apathy but much activity was shewn in conveying crowds of youths m lorries to the P o11 -- ilS ^ of toE wo^ld be illiterate and as ballot papers had to be written on the spot, /thethe supervising committee at each polling booth vrould not have been without inf luence. The National Council, now styling itself the National Parliament, opened on 12th December. The Soviet Consul-G-eneral attended the ceremony. The British, jjnerican, Turkish and Iraqi Consuls-General, though invited, did not attend. The National Parliament proceeded to the election of a cabinet of eleven members. This cabinet includes a Minister for War. 10. The Manager of the National Bank received instructions from Tehr?.n to hand over his cash to the Imperial Bank of Iran for safe custody. Though informed by the Manager of the Imperial Bank of his readiness to accept it, the National Bank Manager feared to carry out his instructions lest the transfer of the cash should be observed by the Democrats. The National Bank deposits are, therefore, now in rebel hands. 11. The Press Attache of the American Embassy who has just returned from a five day visit to Tabriz states that Pishaveri, in an interview with him, admitted | that the democrats were receiving Fcussian support. The Press Attache found the atmosphere of terror typified by the difficulty of getting interviews with non democrats. He gained the impression that during the past few days events had been speeded up, probably in order to confront the Moscow Conference with a fait accompli. 12. Pour British newspaper correspondents who applied to the Russian Consulate in Tehran through this Embassy a week or more ago for passes to enable them to proceed to Tabriz have *not yet received their passes. The situation in Azerbaijan' from the military aspect is, briefly, as follows:- TABRIZ. The G.O.C. , of whose loyalty and vail to resist the Chief of the General Staff and H.M,Consul-General have long been in doubt, sent a W/T message to the General Staff to the effect that he and his garrison had been invited by the Bemocrats to join their cause. The Democrats had started that those officers who did not elect to join them would be free to go. The G.O.C. asked what reply he was to make. He was told to resist. A later message from his Chief of Staff said that the G.O.C. had personally gene over to the rebel cause and that the remaining officers and men were still in barracks and were being sniped. The C. G.S. prepared a message ordering them to resist to the end but was prevented from despatching it by the 'hrime Minister, Minister of War and H. I.M. The Shah who substituted for it the message summarized in para 2 above. A further message was received on the evening of the 14th to the effect that the officers were ready to leave for Tehran. Since then there has been no W/T comniunication with Tabriz and it is to be feared that the garrison a.nd its arms are in rebel hands. The garrison, according to the C.G.S., numbered only 750. Their anas consisted of rifles, light automatics and three mountain guns. REZAIfiH. W/T communication with Tehran has been re-established and the garrison of two battalions is still in its barracks. Looting of shops by democrats is reported. Some Caucasian immigrants have recently arrived from Tabriz. KHOI and SHAHHJR, are believed to be in rebel hands. There are no Persian garrisons there. MIANDOAB. The garrison, a weak battalion of 250, reports by W/T that it is beseiged by a force of about 2,000 Kurds, Assyrians and Democrats. A break out to the South to join the Saqqiz brigade .is impossible. It is, apparently, still resisting. The C.G.S. has ordered a battalion from Saqqiz to. go and /attempt(&lt;§) a&gt;±i^pt its extrication but it is unlikely that the Russians and Kurds will allow thit&gt; force to pass Bukan. KpnRBTT,. No news and it is feared that the garrison will disintegrate. MARAGHSH. No news of this company. The •A. 1.0. C. manager there has been murdered. v Other tro op mov ements outsi de Azerb aijan. A Persian battalion is being sent via Qum, Arak (Sultanabad),. ana Malayir to Kamadan which is an important source of supplies for the capita.1 and which has no garrison. It could also deal with any rebel infiltration into that area southwards from Bukan and Shahin Dej via Bijar. The Persian column of two battalions and a company of gendarmes which had been at Sharifabad near Qazvin ever since the beginning of the crisis has returned to Tehran. Once the Government control of Azerbaijan had ceased and as long as the Russians refused to allow troops to enter Azerbaijai 1 it served no useful purpose. KURDISTAN. 15 . it will be recalled that Hama Rashid, after sacking Baneh, fled into Iraq and gave himself up to the Iraqi authorities in November 1944- Negotiations for his extradition broke down and the Government of Iraq would only agree to an. enforced residence for Hsma Rashid at Kirkuk. The Persian General Staff now clo.im to have received information that Hama Rashid has been allowed to leave or has escaped from Kirkuk and has arrived at Penjwin on the Perso-Iraqi border. They foar that his presence there may endanger the recent and precarious peace secured m this area'by the surrender to the Persian forces of Mahmud Khan Kanisenam, by the death of Mahmud Khan Dizli and by the flight and surrender to the Iraqi authorities of Hasan Khan Rezabi. KHORASAN. 16. ' Khorasan is still without its governor-general and Meshed its governor. Theie have been further arrivals of Tudeh leaders from Tehran. ”1 uhajirs 0 Caucasian origin have been seen in Nishapur and Sabzewar. Villagers m the Sarrakhs area and in the Turcoman Sahra have refused to render their share of gram to the landlords. A Russian loudspeaker installed in Meshed announces the independence o Azerbaijan and calls upon all Azerbaijanis to return to their province. Kishawarz the Tudeh leader, has arrived in Meshed by a Soviet plane and has left for xashkent to attend the celebrations on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the university. PARS. 17. The C.G.S. informed the B.K.A. on 15th December that^ the Persian &amp;° v ^n- ment had proclaimed “a general amnesty for the Tribes of Pars' ana .' c ^ n Oashgai and other tribal leaders had telegraphed their warm appreciation of this generous gesture. No confirmation of this news lias so far appeared m the press. With their hands full in the North and one eye cocked on the + South as a possible ^ bolt hole it is difficult to see what other 'gesture' the Persian Government coula hav! ^de’at timo? It is too much to hope that the tribal leaders of Pars will*detect the Persian Govt’s motives behind this gesture but there is a reasonc-bD hope that they will refrain from blackmailing the government m its present plight. -Appointments. 18.

Persian Affairs. Political. THOUGH important news has come from Azerbaijan, except for some excitement on the 19th December, caused by the arrival in Tehran of the General Officer Commanding, Tabriz, interest seems to have shifted to Moscow and an air of tense expectancy as to the outcome of the conference prevails. 2. On the 18th December in the Majlis the Prime Minister made his long- awaited speech on affairs in Azerbaijan. It was firmer in tone than any of his previous utterances and accused the Russians more directly of interfering in the internal affairs of Persia. He reiterated his intention to proceed to Moscow. In this connexion it is learned that the Persian Ambassador there has so far been unsuccessful in his attempts to contact any responsible official in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. They invariably plead pressure of business as an excuse for not seeing him. 3. The programme of the Azerbaijan Government, as reported by Radio Baku and published in the Tudeh organ Rahbar of the 18th December, is repro duced as Appendix “A” to this summary. 4. An account of the inaugural meeting of the Azerbaijan National Assembly, taken from the paper Rahbar of the 18th December, is published as Appendix “B ” to this summary. 5. An article in the Russian paper Pravda of the 14th December, discussing the question of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Persia, states that “ in reality, there is no question at all, as the Soviet-Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1942 clearly defines the tasks, conditions and period of stay of Soviet troops in Persia.” While there is nothing new in this attitude, a more ominous note is heard when the article goes on to say that “ in any case, under the Soviet-Persian Treaty of 1921, the Soviet Union has the right to bring its troops into Persian territory.” For the benefit of those recipients of this Intelligence Summary who have not a copy of the treaty referred to, the following relevant paragraph is reproduced here :— “ VI. If a third party should attempt to carry out a policy of usurpation by means of armed intervention in Persia, or if such Power should desire to use Persian territory as a base of operations against Russia, or if a foreign Power should threaten the frontiers of Federal Russia or those of its allies, and if the Persian Government should not be able to put a stop to such menace after having been once called upon to do so by Russia, Russia shall have the right to advance her troops into the Persian interior for the purpose of carrying out the military operations necessary for its defence. Russia undertakes, however, to withdraw her troops from Persian territory as soon as the danger has been removed.” It would appear that the writer of the article has an elastic conscience or that he failed to notice the preceding paragraph which states that the two high contracting parties undertake— “ To prohibit the formation or presence within their respective territories of any organisations or groups of persons, irrespective of the name by which they are known, whose object is to engage in acts of hostility against Persia or Russia, or against the allies of Russia.” 6 . The ninth and tenth days of Moharram passed off quietly in Tehran. Mourning processions had been strictly banned by the Military Governor as it was thought that bands of armed hooligans might be assembled under the guise of religious fervour. [73—161] bThe Majlis. 7. At the sessioj^pj^he* 13th December the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill was passed by a majorj^vo^e of 81. A translation will appear in a later issue of this Intelligence Sumnaary. At the session on the 18th December the Prime Minister made a lengthy speech about the situation in Azerbaijan and the steps taken by his government. The speech was frequently applauded. (See para graph 2 above.) Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 8 . On the 19th December Sartip Darakhshani, G.O.C. Tabriz, accompanied by 14 of his officers, arrived in Tehran by Soviet plane. He had, apparently, thought better of his decision to join the rebel army and availed himself of the invitation given previously by the Democrats that those officers who did not wish to join them would be free to leave. He is now under arrest and will be tried by court martial. It was reported in the press on the 23rd and 24th December that a further 70 officers of the garrison have arrived in Tehran by motor coach and train. This leaves about 30 still in Tabriz awaiting transport. Of the 750 rank and file all are reported to have fled, about one-third of them taking their arms. The total of arms seized by the rebels in the deserted barracks is about 800 rifles, 18 machine guns and one mountain gun. 9. The latest news about other garrisons in Azerbaijan is as follows :— Miandoab. —Garrison surrendered. A party of 85 gendarmes made its escape to Saqqiz losing about 35 on the way in casualties and desertions. Ardebil .—Garrison surrendered. Maragheh.—Gavrison surrendered. Rezaieh. —No definite news but Moscow radio reported that fighting is in progress. Mishkin Shahr .—'This small place (50 miles north-west of Ardebil) was omitted from a list of Azerbaijan garrisons previouslv given to the B.M.A. by the C.G.S. - It is now learnt that its garrison of one platoon has sur rendered after losing two officers and half its strength killed. Other troop movements consist of the despatch of a battalion from the Saqqiz garrison to Bijar to protect Hamadan. 10. According to the Governor of the National Bank, the balances at the Tabriz branch which fell into rebel hands (see paragraph 10 of last Intelligence Summary) amounted to 40 million rials (about €300,000), most of which repre sented private and not Persian Government deposits. According to the same authority, the National Government of Azerbaijan has had the effrontery to ask for more funds to be sent from Tehran. This request has, of course, been refused. It is possible that the Azerbaijan Government may now issue some form of notes of its own. Meanwhile it has prohibited the drawing of more than 20.000 rials (£154) on any private account and has advertised the sale of 100 tons of Persian Government sugar which should bring in about 6 million rials (about £45,000). 11 . _ The exchange of the Governor of Zenj an for two Tudeh members (see paragraph 6 of Intelligence Summary, No. 47) has now been completed and the governor has returned to Tehran. 12 . His Majesty’s Consul-General Tabriz reports that the town is quiet with the Democrats exercising strict control. Their armed forces appear to be less than before. Gilan, Mazanderan and Gurgan. 13. According to reports reaching the general staff from Persian police sources and reports (*) received in this embassy from other sources, Tudeh activity in these provinces is increasing. Recent arrivals and departures of Soviet troops show an overall deposit of some 500 remaining in the area. The Tudeh party is said to be preparing a proclamation of autonomy for “ Tabaristan.” (This classical geographical name properly covers the provinces of Mazanderan and Gurgan, but is certainly intended to include Gilan also.) *From that and other sources comes the news that they are calling for volunteers and appear to be anxious to build up an Azerbaijan army of sufficient strength to oppose any Persian forces sent against them if and when the Russian troops withdraw. Recruits are reported to have been offered 150 rials per mensem in addition to clothing and food.3 (w) Bakhtiari. 14 Murteza Quli Khan has been summoned to Tehran for discussions. He is stated to be loth to obey this summons as long as that firebrand Abul Qasim Khan is left behind in Bakhtiari to sow the seeds of dissension and possibly revolt in his absence. Bars. (See paragraph 17 of last Intelligence Summary.) 15. Allusion to this “general amnesty” has been made in the press. Coupled with the amnesty was a permission to “ bear arms with a licence during the present crisis.' The Russian controlled press has not been slow to detect in this an arming of the southern tribes by the reactionary Government of Persia which seeks thereby to start a civil war between these tribes and its freedom loving subjects of Azerbaijan. 16. Mehdi Farrukh, the newly-appointed Governor-General of Fars, has arrived in Shiraz. He called on His Majesty’s Ambassador before leaving and stated that he would seek the advice of His Majesty's Consul in Shiraz on all matters affecting the welfare and security of his province. Appointments. 17.—(i) Ahmad Ali Baniadam to be Governor of Shiraz and Deputy Governor-General of Fars. (ii) Imad Mumtaz, Director-General of the Tribal Department of the Ministry of the Interior, to be Governor of Meshed and Deputy Governor-General of Khorasan. (iii) Ahmad Qadimi Navai to be Persian Consul at Quetta. (iv) Yusuf Sadiq to be Persian Consul at Kerbela. (v) The Persian Press announces the appointment of Hashem Sahba, a Director of the Agricultural Bank, as Minister of Commerce, Industry and Mines—a portfolio hitherto vacant in the present Cabinet. (vi) The same communique announced the appointment of Allahyar Saleh, Minister without Portfolio, as Minister of the Interior vice Khalil Fahimi appointed “ Ustandar of the West,' i.e., Governor- General of Kermanshah. An unconfirmed report says that Fahimi has denied his appointment to this post and has challenged the Prime Minister’s right to drop him from the Cabinet. Allahyar Saleh (F.O. 198-M.A. 253) is reputed, on fairly good authority, to be one of the three Cabinet ministers who consistently advocate a policy of appeasement vis-a-vis the Russians in the present crisis. The other two are General Muhammad Husein Firuz and Nariman. Fahimi, as a member of Saed’s Cabinet of August 1944 to November 1944, which refused the Russians an oil concession, incurred Russian displeasure. His reappearance, as Minister without Portfolio in Bayat’s Cabinet (November 1944-April 1945) and as Minister of the Interior in Hakimi’s Cabinet of November 1945 re-kmdled this resentment. More recently he has been attacked by Dr. Musaddiq in the Majlis and in the press. He is believed to have cordial relations with Seyyid Zia-ud-Din. The recent change, therefore, has the appearance of a sop to the Russians. British Interests. 18 The following item of news appeared in a recent issue of the Daily A ews Bulletin in Tehran i . -p ... , “ A few days ago rumours appeared in a Tehran paper that a Imtisn firm was exploiting chrome deposits in Iranian Baluchistan. This absurd allegation was denied by the B.B.C. m Us Person service of the 11 th December. It was not considered necessary to repeat the denial m r country since of course, anyone is free to go to Baluchistan to see the tacts for himself the same applies to other equally ridiculous rumours of what s happening in Baluchistan. Commentators point out that so far no ndependent witnesses have been permitted to proceed to the north to investi gate charges of illegal exploitation of petroleum m Azerbaijan and Mazanderan.” [73-161]4 American Interests. 19. The large American camp at Amirabad near Tehran, though included in the general sale of their remaining assets on the basis of 7| per cent, of their original cost, was actually sold to His Imperial Majesty the Shah who presented it to the university of Tehran. At a formal ceremony in the presence of the Shah the American flag was hauled down and the camp handed over. The ceremony was marred by a rush of looters who fell upon the camp as soon as the American guards were withdrawn. Telephones were the chief attraction, but, according to one witness, the mob tried to remove “ everything that was not screwed down.” 20. The American Military Mission has recently received some officer replacements and reinforcements. The wives of General Ridley and two of his senior staff have also arrived. Though no official announcement of the prolonga tion of the contract of the mission has been made, it would appear that the mission expect to stay for a year at least. Results of their work are less and less in evidence. Russian Interests. 21. Consular diaries for November received from Zahidan report some increased activity by Russian officials in South-East Persia. They have contacted local officials and their commercial agents and have made enquiries about the strengths of British troops in the area and the extent of British trade. Their chief tribal contact appears to be Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan Purdili. Tehran, 23ty/ December, 1945. V Appendix A. The Programme of the Azerbaijan Government. IN the programme of the Azerbaijan National Government it is stated that:— The Azerbaijan National Government starts its functions with the object of putting an end to all the hardships and difficulties of the nation. It announced its programme as follows :— 1 . It should be announced to all men and to the public throughout the world that Azerbaijan has obtained autonomy within the boundaries of Persia.

The Persian Azerbaijan Government recognises the Central Government and will carry out its orders so long as it does not contravene the laws and decisions of the National Consultative Assembly of Azerbaijan. Appendix B. The Inauguration of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. WEDNESDAY, the 21st Azar, 1324 (12th December, 1945), will be considered an historic date in the history of the valiant Azerbaijanis, and future generations will celebrate this victorious day. On that day the nation of Azerbaijan, by founding their National Assembly in a very honourable manner, proved to the world that they are mature and self-dependent and can decide-their own destinies and that they are the rightful persons to manage their own houses. On Wednesday morning the Deputies of Tabriz and those of other towns and districts gathered together in the Assembly’s public hall. Great crowds gathered m the street to watch the opening of the Majlis. At 9 a.m. a public session was held at which about eighty Deputies were present. M. Nizam-ud-Dauleh Rail i w as elected as President of the Assembly and opened the first public session of the Azerbaijan National Assembly by making a short inaugural speech. The l ' ter “^ '7|“‘f °^ of the Assembly were read out by Vulla i, were fully explained by Pishehvari, an were all passed. The presidential body of the Assembly ^ s the n elected by a secret vote. Haji Mirza Ali Shabistan was elected as Speaker and MM. Padigan and Judat were elected as his deputies; and Azima and Vu la ^ as se . The Speaker then pronounced the desire of the majority in conne Pishehvari’s premiership and appointed him to form a Governme . afternoon of the same day the Cabinet was formed and piesented to the Assembly :— 1 Sayyid Jafar Pishehvari: Prime Minister.

Persian Affairs. Political. SUCH news as has appeared in communiques on the Moscow Conference and such information as has so far been given to the Persian Government and the deductions made therefrom by intelligent Persians have caused widespread despair. It is too early to appreciate the full effects but a sharp decline in British prestige and a further weakening of Hakimi’s Cabinet are already noticeable. 2. Two political forces appear to be working. The first is a move by Hakimi himself to get rid of those Ministers obnoxious to the Russians. Fahimi has gone. Hajhir’s displacement is imminent. Without informing General Riazi of his decision, Hakimi has approached General Yazdan Panah with the offer of the War Ministry. The latter refused. The second is a move by the Right to overthrow Hakimi’s Cabinet and introduce one with more will to resist. Advice has been tendered to the effect that a change would be premature until His Majesty’s Ambassador returns with more detailed information about what has transpired at Moscow and with advice as to the course now to be pursued. 3 . The election of Provincial Councils (see paragraph 6 of Intelligence Summary No. 48) is engaging the attention of the Persian Government and instructions to this end have been issued to Provincial Governors. It is not yet clear whether they will be elected according to the original law providing for them (which is in many details out of date) or by an amended law now said to be ready for presentation to the Majlis. Many Persians believe that the setting up of these councils at this time is dangerous and that they will merely provide a legal way of creating a situation in other provinces similar to that recently created illegally in Azerbaijan. Their fears, naturally, are chiefly over the provinces of Gilan, Mazanderan and Khorasan, which are still in occupation by Russian troops. . . 4. Dr. Siyasi, Dr. Kishavarz and Sadiq Hidayet, invited by the Government of the Uzbekistan Republic to attend the commemoration ceremonies of Tashkent University, have returned to Tehran. . 5. The Persian delegates to the United Nations Organisation which is to meet in Don don on the 10th January are as follows : The Persian Ambassador in London, Nasrullah Intezam, Mustafa Adi (Mansur-us-Salteneh), Seyyid Baqir Kazemi. The following are attached to the delegation : Abul Hasan Hakimi, Fazlullah Nabil, Assadullah Bayendor. The Majlis. 6 Since the 23rd December the Majlis has met daily. A one-twelfth budget Bill to cover the period of Azar 1324 (22nd November-21st December, 1945) was passed. The Bretton Woods Agreement has been ratified unanimously. Internal Security. A zerbaijan. 7. The garrison of Rezaieh has surrendered. It was the sole remaining Persian military force in Azerbaijan. A Tass agency message of the 18th December reported that the commander of the garrison had been wreaking vengeance on those inhabitants who were in sympathy with the Democrats. His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General, who visited Rezaieh on the 22nd December, reported that the Democrats had been in complete control of the town since the 19th December, the garrison haying surrendered. Its commander, Colonel Zanganeh, is believed to be a prisoner in Democrat hands m labriz. Ihe remaining officers, as well as the balance of the labriz officers, have either arrived in Tehran or are on their way. Only one, a Captain Hormuz larnar, is reported [73—162]2 to have joined the rebel army. Regarding the alleged atrocities committed by the garrison before its surrender, His Majesty's Acting Consul-General reports that on the 15th December a column of gendarmes, supported by light tanks, drove a party of armed Democrats from the village of Dedhar Baksh situated about 1 mile from Rezaieh. From the evidence of the Chaldean inhabitants of the village it appears that the Democrats suffered no casualties and that no villager opened fire on the Persian column. The Persian commander maintains that he was fired upon and that he opened fire in defence. Nine villagers were killed and ten wounded. The light tank is said by the Russians and Chaldeans to have driven over the bodies of those killed. The Soviet Vice-Consul later visited the scene and photographed the bodies. The Russian press will make the most of this affair. 8 . His Majesty's Acting Consul-General has also visited Maragheh, where all is quiet with the Democrats in control. The Anglq-Iranian Oil Company’s manager whose murder was reported in the last Intelligence Summary appears to have been killed on account of his being a landowning capitalist and not because of his association with the company. 9. In general Azerbaijan is quiet with Government officers functioning under Democrat control and police, aided by Democrat volunteers, maintaining strict order. 10. A recruiting drive for the “Azerbaijan People’s Army'’ opened in Tabriz on the 19th December. Some fifty horsemen and 2,000 infantry volunteers were brought into the town. The section commanders carried Tommy guns and the rank and file rifles. A few light machine guns were also seen. 11. General Hasan Muqaddam, a former Governor-General of Azerbaijan, has left for Tabriz by Soviet plane. He has vast estates between Maragheh and Miandoab. He is reported to have been offered a post in the Azerbaijan National Government. He is a brother-in-law of Kabiri, the Azerbaijan Government Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and Roads. He is clever, able and unscrupulous. 12. Financial difficulties may cause the Azerbaijan Government to declare its complete independence. It has accused the Central Government of attempting to starve it by cutting off funds and strangling trade. The National Bank has ceased payment. There are two small private banks which are being taken over by the National Government. The Perso-Soviet Bank has never influenced trade. The Imperial Bank of Iran is still functioning. No purchaser for the 100 tons of Persian Government sugar has yet come forward. The National Government has demanded 30 million rials from the Central Government for the payment of officials’ salaries for the next six months. 13. Another source reports that three types are distinguishable among the Democrats’ armed forces, viz. :— (a) Officers and soldiers of the Red army in civilian clothes, dressed in dark blue coat and “plus fours’’ tucked into the ordinary short black leather Russian boot. They are armed with light machine guns and grenades. (b) Caucasians (“ Muhajirs ”) imported into Azerbaijan by the Russians. They are clad in leather coats and fur hats and armed with rifles and machine pistols of Persian arsenal manufacture. (c) The native Azerbaijani armed variously with iron-shod sticks and Brno rifles of Persian arsenal manufacture. 14. Mr. Harold Minor, chief of the Eastern Department in the American State Department and a former secretary in the American Embassy in Tehran, who came to Tehran a fortnight ago to study events in Azerbaijan, has not been able to proceed to Tabriz as the Russian authorities have refused to give him a pass. Six American and British journalists have likewise been prevented from entering an area where Russia “ is in no way interfering in internal affairs.’’ 15. Some short personality notes on the members of the Azerbaijan National Government are given in Appendix A to this Summary. Khorasan. 16. A consular report states that Muntasir, brother of Saulat, is organising an anti-Government gang near Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam in order to revenge his brother’s death. He is receiving Tudeh support. The same report states that the Bicharanlu Kurds near Shirevan and Quchan are armed and in sympathy with the Tudeh party. It will be recalled that Saulat-us-Saltaneh, a Hazara chief, rebelled against the Persian Government in January 1942 and was killed while attempting to escape from a gendarmerie post in the autumn of 1943.Fars. 17. Mehdi Farmkh, the newly appointed Governor-General, has had a chilly reception. A movement to boycott him and force him to return to Tehran, largely the work of Khosrow Qashgai, was frustrated by the efforts of the Qawam-ul- Mulk, who persuaded Nasir Khan Qashgai to desist from this unwise plan. Nasir Khan is reported to have realised that any disturbance in Ears at this yuncture will only embarrass the Central Government at a time when their hands !l,re full and play into the hands of the Russians. 18. The announcement of the general amnesty (referred to in paragraph 15 of the last Intelligence Summary) has had a good effect according to a consular report from Shiraz. It gives both sides cause for satisfaction. It removes from the tribes the fear of the consequences of their acts in the Semirun affair of two years ago and also rallies them to Tehran at a time of crisis for the Central Government. Indeed, a noteworthy feature has been the flow of messages to Tehran conveying the loyalty and support of nearly all the tribes of Persia. Kurdistan. 19. During the past few weeks the Democrats have occupied the stage in Azerbaijan and very little news has been received about Kurdish affairs or Kurdish reactions to the seizure of power by the National Government of Azerbaijan. According to Kurdish sources of doubtful value in Tehran the Kurds are far from happy at the turn which events have taken. They have been drawn into the Russian orbit and have obtained some arms and ammunition, a printing press and a free excursion to Baku. On the debit side they have estranged the Governments of Persia, Iraq and Turkey and have suffered military defeats at the hands of the first two. So far no Russian promises of an independent Kurdistan have been fulfilled. They are not interested in agrarian or labour reforms. They have not been given posts in the new Azerbaijan Cabinet. They may well be thinking that all they have achieved is the exchange of a Persian Government for an Azerbaijani Democrat Government. Persian Army. 20. Reference paragraph 13 of Intelligence Summary No. 48, the General Staff has decided to find the battalion for Hamadan from Saqqiz so as not to decrease the Tehran garrison. . . 21. After the elimination of the Persian army garrisons m Azerbaijan, the only Persian troops remaining inside the Russian Zone (stretching from the Perso- Iraqi frontier near Ushnuyieh to the Perso-Russian frontier near Sarakhs) are the following :—■ At Meshed, one infantry regiment, one artillery battery, one battalion of engineers. At Bujnurd, one cavalry regiment. 22 . (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (V) (vi) (vii (viii (ix) (X) (xi) A ppointments. (“ A ” : Civil)— Abbas Quli Ardelan to be Treasurer-General in the Ministry of Finance.
