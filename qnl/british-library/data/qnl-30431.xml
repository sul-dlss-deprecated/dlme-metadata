CONFIDENTIAL 13th June, 1951* The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf tells me that the caretaker at Khor Kuwai has in formed him that the Sultan has given the Americans permission to establish a similar base some where in the vicinity. If you obtain any confirmation of this would you kindly let me know. I hardly think the Sultan is likely to grant such permission without reference to us as not long ago he appealed to the Treaty of 1891 with reference to the Pakistani's desire to purchase Gwadur.
