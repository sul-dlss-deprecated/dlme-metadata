Stannus apologises for the deficiency of these documents and concludes by stating that a register of the enclosed receipts has already been furnished to Henry Willock's brother, Major George Willock. This letter is not dated; however, falling as it does between a letter dated 24 May 1824 and one dated 25 May 1824, it can be assumed that it was written either on 24 or 25 May 1824. Enclosures not included.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x000059#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
