Title from caption (fol. 1b). The word \"ḥayāh\" in the title is added above the \"bạ̄ʼ\" of \"kitāb\". 11 lines per page. Written in large naskh using black ink, with red or larger script in black for entries. Thick glazed paper, with vertical laid lines visible. The pages have been frame-ruled (10 mm., the copyist writing on every other line). The text is entirely vocalized. Some final letters of a line are placed in the margin, with a space between the end of the line and these letters. Very few notes on the margins. A few catchwords (originally at the end of each quire?). These show that some leaves are missing or misplaced (see between fol. 70b and 71a, 155b and 156a). Traces of numbering of the quires in Arabic ordinals on some leaves, mostly cut off by the trimming of the leaves (see fol. 17a, 24a, 32a, 95a, 107a, 119a). Inscriptions and ownership statements on fol. 1a. The top and fore edges of the text block are decorated with large red dots. Modern pagination in pencil using Western numerals. The paper has been trimmed so that part of the marginalia is lost (see fol. 81a). Fol. 184 and 185 are damaged so that part of the text is lost and colophon can not be read. According to Ph. Hitti, this ms. dates probably from the 14th cent.
